AD COLUMN: DEUTSCH JOINS RUSH COMMUNICATIONS TO REACH YOUNG
CONSUMERS. 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Madison Avenue is hooking up with the hip-hop nation as the
entrepreneurial principals of Deutsch Inc. and Rush Communications
in New York form a joint venture agency specializing in advertising
and marketing to young consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, named dRush, is being opened by Donny Deutsch,
chairman and chief executive of Deutsch, and Russell Simmons, the
music and entertainment impresario who is the chairman and chief
executive of Rush Communications. Simmons, 43, and Deutsch, who
turns 42 on Monday, will be the co-chairmen of dRush, owning the
agency along with Ann Simmons, 36, president of Rush
Communications, who will become president of dRush.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch is the fast-growing agency with clients that include the
Expedia.com unit of Microsoft, Tommy Hilfiger, Ikea, Mitsubishi
Motors and Snapple. Rush Communications is composed of units like
Def Jam, which specializes in rap music; Phat Fashions apparel;
Oneworld, a television series and magazine; Def Pictures; and Rush
Media, an advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   Rush Media will be folded into dRush as its clients, the
Coca-Cola Co. and the Home Box Office unit of Time Warner Inc.,
become the initial clients of dRush. Perhaps the best-known work
from Rush Media are commercials for Coca-Cola Classic; one featured
LL Cool J, the Def Jam rap artist, and another offered a salute to
the soul singer Marvin Gaye.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership between Deutsch and Simmons is emblematic of the
intensified efforts by mainline agencies to search for new ways to
better sell name-brand products for clients, particularly when
aiming pitches at specific consumer groups or niche markets.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples include the formation of Spike DDB by the DDB
Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group and the director Spike Lee and
the opening of a shop called Vigilante by the Leo Burnett Co. unit
of the Leo Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donny says a great idea can come from anywhere,'' Simmons said
of his new partner. ``We've relied on creative talent from all
kinds of places.'' In addition to LL Cool J, acts recording for
Simmons have included the Beastie Boys, Run DMC, DMX, Jay-Z and
Foxy Brown.
</P>
<P>
   In focusing its work on campaigns meant for consumers ages 8 to
17, dRush joins a growing list of agencies like G Whiz, a unit of
Grey Advertising; the Geppetto Group unit of the WPP Group; Kid
Leo, part of Burnett; and Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi Kid Connection.
</P>
<P>
   Here, though, the strategy is for dRush to differentiate itself
by taking a hipper, more cutting-edge approach in appealing to the
mercurial tastes of American youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We market toward the mainstream, but to a cooler element,''
Simmons said. ``Donny, with his big infrastructure, gives us a
chance to really be in the advertising business in a more
significant way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the difference between selling records out of your
trunk and going through Sony,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The new agency will be based in the same building as Deutsch, at
111 Eighth Ave. between 15th and 16th Streets in the Chelsea
neighborhood of Manhattan. There will be about 20 employees at the
start: the former employees of Rush Media, some employees being
transferred from Deutsch and some hired for dRush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consistent theme that runs across all our advertising is
that the youth culture today is an aspirational culture,'' said Ms.
Simmons, who is no relation to Simmons. ``They want what everybody
else has.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And because they're so interested in buying brands,'' she
added, ``you have to offer clients a strategy rooted in the
understanding of the brand architecture: what the product
attributes are, who you're speaking to, what you want to say.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In most advertising situations, agency people are interpreters
of popular culture,'' Ms. Simmons said. ``We're going to bring in
the people who are the creators of popular culture. For example, if
we bring in the people who make the records, your jingle will sound
like a hit record instead of a jingle.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Deutsch and Simmons had considered other partners before
linking up with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons spent months negotiating with Draft Worldwide in
Chicago, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Deutsch had
some brief talks with Sean (Puffy) Combs, whose Bad Boy
Entertainment operates across fields like rap music, restaurants,
fashion licensing and talent representation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five minutes after meeting Russell, I knew this was going to
be a great venture,'' Deutsch said. Simmons echoed him: ``The folks
at Draft are a very smart and talented group. But this is just a
better fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the two meshed because, as they learned during their
discussions, they grew up near each other in the Hollis Hills
neighborhood of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't figure out who used to chase whom after school,''
Deutsch said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons quickly chimed in, ``I used to chase Donny.''

ANALYSIS: ATTACKS BY UNSTABLE PEOPLE RAISE FEARS, IF NOT ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The recent violent attacks against New Yorkers seemed
as random as they were terrifying, occurring during the most
mundane slices of the day _ a sleepy subway commute, a routine
errand on a busy Midtown street. But in the public view, they also
shared another trait _ the attackers appeared to be mentally
unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Such crimes provoke a visceral and by now predictable reaction.
Suddenly every obviously disturbed person who enters a subway car
or coffee shop takes on the menacing aura of a disaster waiting to
happen. There is a vague sense that failures within the mental
health system are endangering New Yorkers' lives, and lawmakers
call for murky reforms.
</P>
<P>
   But experts on the mentally ill and crime strongly concur that
most mentally ill people are not a threat to anyone. They stress
that recent crimes _ a pair of pushings in Manhattan subway
stations, a young man with a box cutter who sliced the faces of
commuters, the beating of a woman with a brick in Midtown this week
_ are statistical anomalies, unfortunate but ultimately
coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lay wisdom has been that mentally ill people are more
dangerous,'' said Christopher Slobogin, a professor of law at the
University of Florida who specializes in mental illness. ``However,
the research does not support the proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some recent studies that suggest a slightly elevated
risk of violence among those who are mentally ill, compared to the
general population. But that risk is limited to a very small pool
of people with extreme cases of manic depressive psychosis or
schizophrenia, and rises more when those particular people abuse
drugs or alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   And mentally ill patients with a criminal background do have a
deficit of services and supervision, which is significant because
the people most likely to commit violent crimes are those who have
committed them in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The public outcry over violent incidents involving mentally ill
people is sharpened by the perception that solutions to the problem
are obvious and within reach. Give the mentally ill more services,
monitor their medications and behavior or, for more resistant
cases, keep them hospitalized or imprisoned for as long as
possible, the arguments go, and tragedies will be few and far
between.
</P>
<P>
   In no case did these arguments seem more painfully clear than in
that of Andrew Goldstein, who prosecutors say pushed Kendra Webdale
to her death in a subway station last January. Goldstein, who had
been in and out of the state's mental health system in the years
preceding Ms. Webdale's death, pleaded insanity; his case resulted
in a hung jury last month, and will be retried next year.
</P>
<P>
   But experts warn that failures in the mental health or legal
systems, as real as they may be, do not really account for these
random acts of violence, and responding to them in the legislative
system only creates bad policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to un-couple the relationship between mental illness
and violence and the delivery of services,'' said Michael Perlin, a
professor at New York Law School. ``These are discrete, vivid cases
of people who act out in these very frightening ways, and are not
endemic to people in the New York system.''
</P>
<P>
   The disproportionate fear of mentally ill people committing
crimes stems in large part from the way the crimes are carried out.
Unlike the majority of violent acts, which tend to befall victims
by known attackers, attacks by mentally ill assailants are often
random and inexplicable, creating a sense that anyone anywhere is a
potential mark.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Webdale's death struck a chord with New Yorkers
precisely because, unlike cases where crimes result from disputes
or robberies, this attack came in a place the mayor and police have
argued is more or less safe these days, in a situation millions of
residents find themselves in daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look in absolute terms,'' said Slobogin, ``if you are
attacked in a subway, it is much more likely to be by a nonmentally
ill person than a mentally ill person. But it may be that when the
perpetrator is mentally ill, the attack is more clearly random. And
random attacks are what scare people.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, Julio Perez, who was homeless and schizophrenic, was
charged with pushing a man in front of a No. 6 train that severed
the man's legs. Damien Purrier, a high school student whose life
had seemed to unravel in a tangle of anger, was arrested last week
on charges that he slashed several commuters during a terrifying
ride on a Manhattan-bound subway train.
</P>
<P>
   Purrier has not claimed to be mentally ill, but friends and
relatives said that he had recently suffered some form of great
mental distress. And while the suspect in the case of a young woman
who was beaten this week in Midtown with a brick remains at large,
police have also suggested that the attacker was unstable.
</P>
<P>
   But therein lies another problem with cases that appear to be
tied to mental illness: One person's diagnosis is another person's
excuse. Law enforcement officials often bristle at pleas of any
form of instability as a defense in a violent crime. And what
constitutes a dangerous mental illness can be highly subjective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are beholden to visual imagery of the `crazy' person and we
attribute what we know about a few to all,'' Perlin said. ``Mental
health reform responds to one media circus, as was the case when
Hinckley shot Reagan and there were calls for institutionalization
without thinking of impact. We should not aspire to return to
that.''

CALL OF THE WILD, VAN NUYS WOLVES MEET THE REAL THING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Troy Anderson 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Robert Smith led the leashed gray wolf Tatonka
toward 50 nervous students Thursday at Van Nuys High School, where
the mascot is a wolf.
</P>
<P>
   The yellow-eyed, 125-pound canine can exert three times more jaw
pressure than a German shepherd, enough to rip a human arm off,
warned Smith, ranch manager for Wolves -N- Wildlife, a Fillmore
educational group.
</P>
<P>
   For a few tense moments, the teen-agers sat silently, not
knowing what to expect next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, how cute,'' 17-year-old junior Anush Artenyan said
finally, breaking the silence and bringing smiles to her
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Smith brought the 1{-year-old wolf to school to show the
students wolves are one of the world's most misunderstood animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We teach kids the wolf is not the evil animal in `Little Red
Riding Hood,''' Smith said. `It's actually a gentle animal that
will not hunt you down. It's not the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Tatonka was raised in captivity and is used to being
around humans.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Champion, executive director of Mercy Crusade, Inc., a
Thousand Oaks-based animal humane organization that sponsored the
event, said she hopes the students understand the importance of
protecting endangered wildlife like wolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these kids will never get to see a real wolf,'' she
said. ``Being the school is the home of the Wolves, this was
perfect. The school is now interested in adopting this wolf as its
mascot.''
</P>
<P>
   For student 17-year-old student Alisa Akilyan, the experience
with the wolf was a memorable one, but she wanted to get closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eyes attracted me from far away,'' she said. ``When I saw
the wolf, I noticed he wouldn't attack people. I could tell he was
kind so I didn't get scared. I wish I could have touched him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolves -N- Wildlife is an educational wildlife group located on
a 120-acre ranch in Fillmore, also home to nine other wolves, a
Siberian tiger and a black bear.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, wolves ranged all over the United States in large
numbers, but traps and poison made them virtually extinct by 1930,
he said. In 1971, wolves were placed on the endangered species
list. Since then, wolves have been reintroduced in some western
states and now number about 5,000, Smith said. &QL;

`RKO 281' EFFECTIVELY RAISES 'KANE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If that means anything to you, you'll love ``RKO 281.'' Even if
it doesn't, you'll still get a kick out of the HBO movie about the
making of a movie _ and not just any movie but the greatest of all
time, ``Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest _ that's what we know it as anyway. When the
26-year-old Orson Welles first finished his masterpiece, it was
known as trouble. That's because it was essentially a biographical
shot fired across the bow of William Randolph Hearst, who used all
the power his media empire gave him to try to prevent the film from
hitting theaters. (The title refers to the studio production number
of the film; Welles used it as the working title to keep the
project secret.)
</P>
<P>
   Talk about chutzpah. Not on the part of Hearst or Welles. On the
part of John Logan, who wrote the script about the most famous
script ever written.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the first moment I sat down to write it, the ghost of
Orson Welles was hovering over me the entire time,'' Logan said
from New York last week, the day after ``RKO 281'' premiered there.
``It required a good bit of audacity I think Welles would have
smiled at.''
</P>
<P>
   Audacity is something with which Welles was familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no greater self-dramatizer in American entertainment
history as the brilliant Orson Welles,'' Logan said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Logan felt comfortable fabricating scenes that
dramatize events that never took place. At the beginning of the
movie, for instance, Welles (played by Liev Schreiber) and Herman
Mankiewicz (John Malkovich plays the man who co-wrote the ``Kane''
script) dine as Hearst's guests at San Simeon, the publisher's
castlelike compound. A disagreement between Hearst and Welles sets
the filmmaker on the road to his movie.
</P>
<P>
   Never happened. So why pretend it did?
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a question of dramatic necessity because it's the
old Aristotelian `Your characters have to look each other in the
eyes at the beginning and the end of the journey,' '' Logan said.
``And it was not so much of a leap because, at that time,
Mankiewicz was going to San Simeon all the time and Welles was very
much part of the Hollywood nightlife scene. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Welles himself was the great fabricator and provocateur of all
time. The stories he would tell as a raconteur, sprinkling bits of
truth and bits of fantasy and bits of drama, were just so
magnificent it was irresistible not to attempt some of that
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever qualms you may have about such dramatic license, the
scene pays off, with Schreiber, who happily doesn't imitate Welles
but pretty much becomes him, giving a stirring soliloquy about
bullfighting that would put Ernest Hemingway to shame.
</P>
<P>
   As for the end of the journey, to further satisfy Aristotle
after their titanic battle of the egos ends, Welles and Hearst
(James Cromwell) meet in an elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Now come on. This was too good to be true, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``That happened,'' Logan said. ``At least, according to Orson
Welles it happened. Even when I read that I said, `Now I know this
never really happened.' But Orson Welles says it happened, so it's
too good not to include.''
</P>
<P>
   With its breezy pace, ``RKO 281'' plays at times like ``Citizen
Kane Lite.'' Yet never does it fail to bring to light effectively
the egos of its main characters. And let's face it, with characters
like these, you can't really go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been too easy to villainize Hearst, to make him
the villain in the black hat and Orson Welles the hero,'' Logan
said, ``when, of course, they were both heroes and villains
simultaneously. Or neither. They were human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Citizen Kane'' itself, ``RKO 281'' is as much a movie
about missed chances as anything else. When Hearst tells Marion
Davies, his mistress (played by Melanie Griffith), ``I am a man who
could have been great but was not,'' he clearly is summarizing
Welles as well. Despite their bitter fight, the two men had much in
common, not all of it (or much, even) flattering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're different sides of the exact same coin,''
Logan said. ``It was almost a triangulation between Orson Welles,
William Randolph Hearst and Charles Foster Kane. At all points,
those three characters are reflecting each other. That paradigm was
central to everything we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the real center is Welles himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welles is always the centerpiece,'' Logan said. ``He's the
center of the orchestra, and all the other instruments, be it
Hearst's cello or Marion's violin, are always playing his tune.''
</P>
<P>
   Though obviously to a lesser extent than ``Citizen Kane,'' in
``RKO 281,'' they manage to make that cacophonous racket sound
triumphant. &QL;

ELEVEN KILLED IN COLLAPSE OF BONFIRE FRAMEWORK AT TEXAS A&AMP;M
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Writethru to reflect new death toll, with two students
confirmed dead late last night, edits to conform) (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By Chris Vaughn 
And John Moritz 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ The pyramid framework for one of Texas
A&AMP;M's oldest celebrations _ the Aggie Bonfire _ crumbled in a heap
of cascading logs before dawn Thuursday, killing at least eleven
students and raising cries to eliminate one of college football's
greatest traditions.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen other Aggies were injured in the collapse,
several critically.
</P>
<P>
   University President Ray Bowen called the accident ``a great
tragedy'' and ``probably the single worst'' incident in A&AMP;M
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is broken-hearted about what happened,'' said Bowen,
who canceled the bonfire lighting, which was scheduled for
Thanksgiving night, on the eve of A&AMP;M's game with archrival
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Texas Aggie family and the world, this has been a day
of unspeakable grief and sorrow,'' Bowen said last night at a
40-minute memorial service attended by more than 16,000 people at
Reed Arena on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all trying to cope with this tremendous loss of life and
the pain and suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at the service were Lt. Gov. Rick Perry and former
President George Bush, whose presidential library is at A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggie Bonfire dates back to 1909 and annually attracts tens
of thousands of spectators. It has been canceled only once before _
after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in November
1963.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen declined to say whether the bonfire will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very important tradition to us,'' he said, ``but those
decisions must be made at a calmer time.''
</P>
<P>
   A group calling itself Aggies Against Bonfire has called in the
past for the abolition of the event, saying it wastes resources,
pollutes the air and contributes to dozens of injuries and
alcohol-related arrests each year.
</P>
<P>
   Sallie Turner, editor of the student newspaper ``The
Battalion,'' said some of the university's 43,000 students
questioned about the bonfire yesterday said ``it's not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonfire is one of the most sacred traditions to Texas A&AMP;M's
campus,'' said Turner, 20, a Fort Worth high school graduate.
``It's one of the status symbols of our university. People say this
is historic because this is the end of Bonfire.''ay Barrington, a 21-year-old senior, said the bonfire should be
lighted as scheduled next week as a tribute to those who were
killed building it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know they died to build it,'' Barrington told The
Associated Press. ``They wouldn't want it to just get put away.
They'd want it to burn.''
</P>
<P>
   To erect what would have been this year's 55-foot tall bonfire
of about 7,000 logs, students spent several weeks cutting logs into
about 10-foot lengths that were hoisted with the aid of cranes and
tractors. The logs then were bound together, three at a time, with
baling wire to form what resembles a tiered wedding cake.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the students who were building the bonfire framework nor
the faculty adviser could explain why it collapsed with about 70
students on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out here about 10:30 last night and I did not see
anything that would indicate trouble,'' said Rusty Thompson, the
faculty adviser to the project. ``There was no indication to me
that there was anything different or unusual about last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M sophomore Diana Estrada told AP that she was about 200
yards from the stack when it fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just toppled over, and the wires snapped and the lights
started sparking and going on and off,'' she said. ``We ran over
there as fast as we could, and we could see legs sticking out and
hear people screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   Killed were Jerry Self, a sophomore engineering technology major
from Arlington, Texas; Chad Powell, a first-year computer
engineering major from Keller, Texas; Jeremy Frampton of Turlock,
Calif; Bryan McClain from San Antonio; Christopher Breen from
Austin, Texas; Nathan Scott West from Bellaire, Texas; Jamie Hand
from Henderson, Texas; Lucas Kimmel from Corpus Christi, Texas;
Christopher Lee Heard from Houston; and two students who were
confirmed dead late Thursday night and whose identities were not
released.
</P>
<P>
   Three students were in critical condition, one was in serious
condition and three in fair condition at St. Joseph Regional Health
Center. Another 18 students were treated for minor injuries and
released.
</P>
<P>
   At College Station Medical Center, one student was in critical
condition and two were admitted with broken bones.
</P>
<P>
   Several students who had completed their shifts building the
bonfire framework said they heard about the accident after
returning to their dorm rooms and raced to the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really couldn't do anything,'' said Matt Heidrick, 18, of
Tyler. ``The fire department was already here.''
</P>
<P>
   Heidrick and Caleb Richers, 18, of Bryan said everything
appeared normal when they left the construction about midnight.
</P>
<P>
   `We were crawling all over it,'' Richers said. ``I would have
never had any idea that something like this was about to happen. It
all looked normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethan McDaniel, a 19-year-old freshman from DeSoto, Texas, said
he was standing some distance from the construction when he heard a
snapping noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unmistakable,'' McDaniel said. ``You could hear the
creaking, snapping sound and then the screams. There were screams
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel's roommate, Adam Brzozowski, 19, from DeSoto, was
several hundred yards away when he heard the same sound.
</P>

   ``There was a creak and then it just tipped over like a stack of
cards,'' Brzozowski said. ``If you were on the wrong side, there
was nothing you could do about it. You were just trapped.''
</P>
<P>
   The university's police department will head the investigation
into the accident, and a number of engineering and construction
firms statewide have offered help in analyzing how it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Early speculation centered on the integrity of the so-called
center pole, the largest log, which is steel-reinforced, in the
middle of the structure. But officials said it was too early to
know whether the pole broke during the fall or whether a break
caused the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said there was no horseplay at the time of the
collapse, and he dismissed criticism that no full-time university
employee was at the site. (MORE)

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
COLLEGE STATION _ For Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum, Thursday ceased
to be just another day of practice for the Texas game at 6 a.m.
<TEXT>
<P>
   An early-morning telephone call brought the shattering news that
the Aggie bonfire stack had collapsed. Eleven students were killed,
and 28 were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The coach and his team did not meet for practice Thursday, but
it was a day for teamwork nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 players spent the afternoon at the bonfire site,
helping recovery workers haul away hundreds of logs as they were
removed from the toppled stack.
</P>
<P>
   They performed, according to one bonfire worker, the work of 40
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few of us decided to come out,'' said offensive lineman
Semisi Heimuli. ``The next thing you know, everyone started showing
up. The whole team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about helping fellow Aggies. This is the best way to show
our support. It's been nonstop out here. It motivates us to see
them, as hard as they work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody pulls together,'' said quarterback Randy McCown.
``We wanted to come out and maybe take a load off of some of the
guys that have been here all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We care about them the same way they care about us. This is
the only thing we've thought about. We had to help. It doesn't
matter the color of skin or where you're from or from what
background you came from. If you're an Aggie, you care.''
</P>
<P>
   The bonfire is a familiar tradition to Slocum, who has visited
the stack every year during his decade as Aggies head coach and
worked on the bonfire as recently as two years ago. He wasn't
surprised his players gathered there Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never alone when you're an Aggie,'' Slocum said.
``Players decided to go because they felt they needed to be there.
This is what they need to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the bonfire always has symbolized what Aggies hope will
be success for the football team, Slocum has long admired the
dedication of the bonfire workers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see in their faces the excitement of being involved in
this,'' he said. ``They set an example for what Aggies are, what
the spirit of this place is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The game will go on, with kickoff at 10 a.m. Nov. 26 at Kyle
Field. The Aggies will wear helmet stickers honoring the victims.
Also still scheduled is the annual Texas-Texas A&AMP;M luncheon
sponsored by the Touchdown Club of Houston, set for Wednesday at
the J.W. Marriott Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But the deaths also struck home in Austin, where the Texas
Longhorns observed a moment of silence in memory of the A&AMP;M
students following their Thursday afternoon practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the game was Friday, I don't know that anybody could
play,'' Texas coach Mack Brown said. ``For me to think about losing
a child is very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the tragedy and the kids and families are much bigger
than the tradition (of the game). I don't think it's appropriate
today to talk about anything other than those kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas fullback Ricky Brown said the coach used Thursday
morning's accident to drive home another point about the fragile
nature of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Guys, you never know what can happen,''' Ricky Brown
said. ```Those people who were building the bonfire thought they
would be at the game on Friday, and for some reason or another they
didn't make it. So you've got to take care of yourselves.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, as in College Station, football didn't seem important
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the football game is very low in importance in
relation to people's lives,'' Ricky Brown said. ``My heart goes out
to the families of the victims. The football game doesn't really
compare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have to play it. It's still on our schedule. But I
think that hearts will be with the families of the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's accident is likely to spark calls for the bonfire to
be abolished. Dallas Cowboys rookie linebacker Dat Nguyen, Texas
A&AMP;M's career tackle leader and last season's Lombardi Award winner,
said the tradition is riveting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would drive by and see those guys out there working all
night long, putting the time and effort into it. It's
unbelievable,'' Nguyen said. ``The tradition is so big at that
school. People don't really understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there's a lot of risk in what they're doing, but now you
see that anything can happen. Now you've got to sit back and
evaluate and see whether it is worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's meet between women's swimming teams from Texas A&AMP;M
and North Texas was postponed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a very emotional day for everyone,'' first-year
coach Steve Bultman said. ``It would be unreasonable to expect our
athletes to be able to compete and inappropriate to hold an event
on such a solemn day.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
COLLEGE STATION _ Every year, for as long as Texas-Texas A&AMP;M has
epitomized college football in this state, a lone figure has stood
in the glow of the Aggie bonfire to read a page from his school's
storied history.
</P>
<P>
   The throng of 50,000 or so Aggies becomes still. A hush falls
over the moment, and a yell leader reads a poem written in honor of
departed Aggies titled The Last Corps Trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was judgment day in Aggieland and tenseness filled the air.
All knew there was a trip at hand, but not a soul knew where''
</P>
<P>
   These words seemed to echo off the walls of Rudder Tower, over
the Memorial Student Center lawn, off the Kyle Field bleachers and
all around the bonfire site Aggies hold dear. A grave hush fell
over Texas A&AMP;M on Thursday. The campus became still, the mood
sullen.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggie bonfire stack crumbled, killing 11 students and
injuring 28, raising questions about the safety and validity of the
bonfire and casting a pall over a game that is, in fact, just a
game.
</P>
<P>
   The words from the traditional bonfire poem could not have
reverberated more poignantly across a campus that prides itself on
closeness and camaraderie and being nothing if not steeped in
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   `` out in front with royal guard, the reviewing party stood, St.
Peter and his angel's staff were choosing bad from good''
</P>
<P>
   This was not a time to judge the bonfire's merits, the danger of
building it higher. This was not a time for arguing over what could
have been done to prevent the tragedy and what should be done about
the bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   `` `By Jove, I do believe I've seen this gallant team before.
I've seen them play since way back when and they've always had the
grit. I've seen them lose and I've seen them win, but I've never
seen them quit. No need for us to tarry here deciding upon their
fate. 'Tis plain as the halo on my head, they've opened heaven's
gates'''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of students gathered at the site Thursday, hugging and
crying, and wondering why and how something as innocent as spirit
could become so tragic. Heaven's gates opened for a group of Texas
A&AMP;M students whose only charge was to keep alive the tradition,
carry on the burning desire that has glowed over this campus for
more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   Football practice was canceled for lack of interest. It's just a
game. A group of players led by Semisi Heimuli, Tiki Hardeman, Sean
Coryatt, Amon Simon, Chris Valletta, Shane Lechler and Jason Glenn
knew what mattered. They went to the site and helped clear debris.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, the team was covered with silt and dirt, and
the players still felt as if they hadn't done enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just knew we had to help,'' Valletta said. ``That's what
Aggies do. Not one guy was thinking about football. When the stack
fell, it struck the hearts of every single Aggie in the world. When
I was out there, I was standing next to a guy who had tears in his
eyes as he was lifting a log. I was standing next to a guy that
lost his best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the players, linebacker Christian Rodriguez, lost one of
his best friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's far more important for our players to be out here rather
than out practicing football plays,'' coach R.C. Slocum said at the
site. ``There is a loyalty and a spirit at Texas A&AMP;M like no other
place. One of the great things about being an Aggie is you'll never
be alone. There will always be Aggies out there that you can share
things with. We'll get through this, and we'll get through it
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe only the words of the poem _ the one that in the saddest
of ironies is read at bonfire _ can tell why Thursday was a day
that might have brought this fraternity of Aggies closer than ever.
</P>
<P>
   `` The drum major slowly raised his hand and said, `Boys, let's
play the Spirit for the last time in Aggieland.' And the band
poured forth the anthem in notes both bright and clear and Aggie
voices sang the song they hold so dear. And when the band had
finished, St. Peter wiped his eyes and said, `It's not so hard to
see they're meant for paradise.' And the colonel of the Cadet Corps
said as he stiffly took his stand, `It's just another corps trip,
boys, we'll march in behind the band.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies are tradition. Texas A&AMP;M tradition is undeniable,
whether it is the school you love or the school you loathe. It is
loyalty and pride and devotion. It is why the Aggies gathered on
one of their darkest days and rose like rarely before. It is why
the 65-foot bonfire might be inherently ominous and should raise
questions of safety.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the bonfire should be disposed of, or at least scaled
back and more closely controlled by professionals in construction
and technology.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday was not the day to answer those questions. It was a
day for Aggie tradition and sense of family to burn bright _
brighter than any bonfire.

   ``These students who work on the bonfire are adults,'' Thompson
said. ``They have a lot of background and experience. They have
on-the-job training.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant Crowell, 19, of Houston was supposed to have been working
on the bonfire at the time of the accident, but said he had skipped
the first few hours of his shift to watch the annual Leonids meteor
shower.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was leaving his dorm room for the site about 3 a.m.
when he heard a siren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard one siren, which I just dismissed,'' he said. ``But
then I started hearing more as I was walking through campus. And I
topped that hill right there and saw it down. Dust was flying and
all the lights had been knocked out. I just tried to help people,
because it was just chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bowen canceled this year's bonfire, he said he feels
the need to come up with something else for the students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're dealing with the loss of our students,'' he
said. ``But within the next 48 hours, we're going to have to take a
look at this. We need to think about an alternate event to bond the
Aggie community.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris DeChillo, a junior from Austin, worked through the
afternoon with members of his unit in the Corps of Cadets, moving
logs out of the way. He stopped long enough to consider whether the
bonfire was worth it and, like many students, he staunchly defended
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what A&AMP;M is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggie football team canceled practice Thursday and showed up
to help clear the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more important than any game or any practice,'' said
Chris Valletta, a starting offensive guard.
</P>
<P>
   Head football coach R.C. Slocum toured the site about 4:30 p.m.
and said the entire team had helped in the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``A&AMP;M is a special place. The loyalty that Aggies feel for each
other is what we're all going to have to rely on to get through
this tragedy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum called the bonfire ``an exercise in young people working
together. It's something that's been very, very good for A&AMP;M.''

MODANO EARNS TIE FOR STARS AGAINST PHILADELPHIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Almost 10 full games, almost 600 minutes of
hockey, had passed since Stars forward Mike Modano last had scored
a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frustrating,'' Modano said, describing his goal-scoring slump.
</P>
<P>
   Add finished to that description.
</P>
<P>
   Modano poked a loose puck past Philadelphia goalie John
Vanbiesbrouck with 30.7 seconds remaining in regulation last night.
With a single poke, he ended his slump, forced overtime and
eventually allowed the Stars to escape with a 1-1 tie against the
Philadelphia Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   He may just have left his frustration in Philly, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's frustrating,'' Flyers captain Eric Lindros said.
``You work real hard and have a one-goal lead heading into the last
minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had struggled to get any type of scoring attack going for
59 minutes. Instead, in a game Stars coach Ken Hitchcock called
playoff-like, a neutral zone-clogging, low risk-taking
defense-playing style permeated both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Typical Stars hockey from a season ago.
</P>
<P>
   Only, Dallas trailed 1-0 instead of leading by a goal with 60
seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   So Hitchcock yanked his goalie for a final lunge at
Philadelphia. Defenseman Sergei Zubov, although notcredited with an
assist, sneaked a pass through traffic and through Vanbiesbrouck's
crease to a waiting Modano.
</P>
<P>
   ``A skate,'' Modano clarified. ``It hit a skate.''
</P>
<P>
   He scooped and flipped Zubov's by-then bouncing pass past a
stunned Vanbiesbrouck.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a play across and the puck found a way to Modano
where he could poke at it,'' said Vanbiesbrouck, who finished with
24 saves. ``It hit my pad and went in. It's disappointing at the
end to tie like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars players felt that, at least, a point had been earned on
defense alone.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' defense, an enigma so far this season, played
exceptionally well, except for a single play.
</P>
<P>
   The one play, a goal by Flyers forward Daymond Langkow at 4:56
of the first period, was the one notable exception. And it
shouldn't have counted. Replays showed Philadelphia's Chris Therien
to be off sides on the play.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, mainly Zubov, looked to relax in anticipation of the
whistle, when it didn't come Therien blew past him and sent the
pass into the slot where Langkow buried it.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much else for the Flyers to get the rest of the
night. What slipped past the forwards, the Stars defensemen gobbled
up. What the defensemen missed, Stars goalie Ed Belfour smothered
to finish with 19 saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's something we haven't done as well this year as
we have in the past,'' Belfour said of the Stars defense. ``We
talked about that we wanted to play a lot better in our zone and I
think that's what we accomplished tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hitchcock: ``We played the game we needed to play. We kept
it a game for as long as we could and I think we played a strong
third period.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' style wasn't flashy or high-flying or necessarily
even fun for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   But it was good enough to get the Stars a tie in a game where
they once again didn't score on the power play (0-for-3), were shut
out for 59:29 and were sharing in Modano's frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He isn't the only one,'' Stars forward Brett Hull said later
when asked if he could sense Modano's frustration from the lack of
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Stars from Modano on down would like to score more. But
for now this is exactly the type of game they are going to have to
play if they are going to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is your typical NHL game now,'' Hull said,
``boring and no action.''

IN 12TH MAN TRADITION, AGGIES PLAYERS HELP IN TRAGEDY

<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Texas A&AMP;M linebacker Jason Glenn,
wearing his game-day undershirt, shorts and gloves, was covered
from head-to-toe in dirt and sweat. It appeared he had stepped out
of the past when football was played with leather helmets and
broken noses.
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn had not played in a game.
</P>
<P>
   He and most of his teammates spent yesterday assisting in the
search-and-recovery efforts at the bonfire site where at least nine
students were killed and 28 injured when the structure built for
students to show their ``burning desire'' in advance of the annual
showdown with Texas collapsed early yesterday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1922, A&AMP;M students have been known as the Twelfth Man for
their support of the Aggies' football team. Yesterday, however, the
football team became the Twelfth Man.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after the 40-foot pyramid collapsed, players began
volunteering to help move logs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people come out and build this thing for us every year,
and they come out and support us every game,'' A&AMP;M quarterback
Randy McCown said. ``Other than performing on the field, we don't
have a chance to give back to them. This is our opportunity to show
them that we care about them as much as they care about us.''
</P>
<P>
   The game against the University of Texas will go on as scheduled
Nov. 26 but probably without the usual emotions. A&AMP;M athletic
director Wally Groff said the NCAA will allow the Aggies to wear a
decal on their helmets in memory of those killed. There also will
some mention of the victims during the pregame, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas athletic director DeLoss Dodds called Groff yesterday to
offer condolences, but with the game a week away, they never
discussed canceling the game, Groff said.
</P>
<P>
   All thoughts were on helping clear debris yesterday, and it did
not seem to matter that most of the rest of the team did not
personally know anyone buried in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard a bunch of our fellow students were down,'' A&AMP;M
offensive lineman Chris Valletta said. ``We all just jetted out
here as soon as we could, because we heard they needed help moving
all these logs. It's the least we could do. These people gave their
lives in that thing out there all in support of a game we're about
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Aggies coach R.C. Slocum, who learned of the accident in a 5:45
a.m. phone call, canceled practice shortly after hearing that his
players were moving logs removed from the stack. The team will meet
today and return to practice tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody's heart would have been in practice,''
Slocum said. ``Something like this is so monumental compared to the
thought of trying to get ready for a football game. We're all just
in shock. At some point, obviously, we'll have to get back to some
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These young people who are injured and the ones who died felt
strongly enough about school spirit and the game that they were out
here working on this bonfire. We owe it to them to be as well
prepared as we can be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies postponed a swimming meet against North Texas
yesterday, but all athletic events will proceed as scheduled today.
</P>
<P>
   ``With any tragedy like this, one of the things everyone learns
is, as hard as it is, you have to deal with it and work through it
and go about your lives,'' Groff said.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum had planned for the football team to lift the spirits of
the construction crew with an unannounced visit to the bonfire site
in the coming days. Instead, the players showed up yesterday to
move logs out of the way of emergency workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great things about being an Aggie is you'll never
be alone,'' said Slocum, who has worked on the bonfire in recent
years. ``Aggies stick together, and Aggies support Aggies. That
loyalty that Aggies feel for each other is what we'll have to rely
on to get through this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   At Texas, the annual Hex Rally planned for Monday night has been
changed to a unity gathering at 9 p.m. in front of the UT tower.
Students, alumni, friends of Texas A&AMP;M and the University of
Texas-Austin are invited to attend. Brown and UT president Dr.
Larry Faulkner are among those scheduled to attend. The tower will
be darkened in memory of the victims. All funds from the sale of
Hex Rally T-shirts will be donated to a memorial fund at A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Flags in front of the main building on campus and at the
football stadium have been lowered today to half mast.
</P>
<P>
   ``On behalf of the students, faculty, staff and administration
of the University of Texas at Austin, I extend our deepest sympathy
to the Texas A&AMP;M community as it copes with today's tragic
events,'' Faulkner said. nn

   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ As scores of Texas A&AMP;M University
students were busy constructing a tower for the school's
traditional football bonfire, the 40-foot structure buckled and
collapsed early on Thursday, killing at least 11 students beneath a
snarl of logs the size of telephone poles.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers worked through the evening, and the bodies of two
missing students, a man and a woman buried beneath the
pyramid-shaped wreckage, were found late on Thursday night.
Throughout a day plagued by heat and dust, local firefighters and
hundreds of students wearing hard hats picked through the logs,
rescuing several students who had been trapped for hours. At least
28 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, where football is often described as a secular
religion, the news prompted immediate and widespread grieving as
many television and radio stations interrupted regular programming
to broadcast the rescue efforts. The bonfire is a 90-year-old Texas
A&AMP;M tradition held on the eve of the school's Thanksgiving weekend
game against its archrival, the University of Texas, and this year
it had been scheduled for Thanksgiving night.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred at 2:28 a.m., an hour that might seem
unusual, but traditionally students work round-the-clock on the
tower during the week leading up to the game. Officials said the
logs collapsed during a shift change by the student workers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ray Bowen, the university president, said investigators had
not yet determined the cause of the accident, and officials refused
to confirm reports that a 55-foot center pole had snapped, saying
that experts would work into the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great tragedy,'' said Bowen, noting that the bonfire
will now be canceled. ``Everyone is brokenhearted.''
</P>
<P>
   Late into the evening, hundreds of people at the floodlit site,
waiting for news of those missing, silently watched as cranes
methodically plucked logs off the pile.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, campaigning out of state for the Republican
presidential nomination, expressed his sadness and offered his
condolences to the families of the dead. His father, former
President Bush, whose presidential library is on the campus, joined
university officials to lead a memorial service Thursday evening
inside the school's basketball arena. More than 10,000 people
listened to the school's singing cadets sing the school song.
</P>
<P>
   Though most universities enjoy the allegiance and loyalty of
their students and alumni, few schools elicit the sort of lifelong
passion common at Texas A&AMP;M. Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, a Texas A&AMP;M
alumnus who worked on the construction crews as a student, said the
bonfire was a symbol of the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extraordinary coming together of the student body
to build this bonfire,'' Perry said, in explaining the sentiment
many Aggies, as students and alumni are known, hold for the
bonfire. ``It is very much a part of Aggie lore and traditions and
values. It represents great teamwork. It represents friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Students at the scene described a horrible collapse in the
early-morning hours when much of the campus was sleeping. Tommy
Balez, 20, an electrical engineering student who started working on
the pyramid around midnight, had taken a break about 50 yards away
when he heard a crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a loud crack, then another loud crash when it went
over,'' Balez said. He spent more than 12 hours as part of a rescue
team. ``I'm staying until I know everybody is out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Lawson, an acting university spokeswoman, denied any
speculation that carousing by students might have contributed to
the collapse. ``There was no horsing around,'' she said. ``This is
very serious business. They were working, not playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Thompson, a Texas A&AMP;M staff member assigned as a student
adviser on the bonfire project, who visited the site at about 10:30
Wednesday night, said he saw no indications at that time of any
problems. At a press conference Thursday afternoon, he said,
``There was no indication of anything unusual. It apparently
collapsed without warning.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students apparently told rescue officials that the center
log snapped at the beginning of the collapse. Thompson said the
center pole is actually two poles bolted together and wrapped in
about 600 feet of steel cable.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Throughout a day plagued by heat and dust, hundreds of rescue
workers labored as cranes and bulldozers picked delicately through
the wreckage. ``We're not sure what might be holding up what, and
the crew has to be meticulous at what they're doing,'' said Dr. Kem
Bennett, director of Texas Task Force One, a statewide emergency
rescue unit. ``This is far worse than in a building collapse in
that the structure twisted as it collapsed and all of the pieces
are tangled together.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams of about a dozen male and female students in hard hats
worked quietly, hoisting logs the size of telephone poles onto
their shoulders and moving them away from the collapsed structure.
At different times rescuers detected tapping noises and followed
the sounds toward trapped students. Officials said the last rescue
occurred at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a game of pick-up sticks. The logs are all
intertwined. It's a slow process, very meticulous,''' said Bart
Humphreys, public information officer for the College Station fire
department.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the yellow police tape, several hundred students hugged
and consoled one another, their dust-streaked faces also streaked
with tears. Several female students pinned white ribbons to shirts,
while others stood in a circle saying prayers. Everyone seemed
shocked and horrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't imagine what I saw when I came here last night,''
said Will Hurd, the student body president. ``Bonfire started as a
symbol of our burning desire to support our football team and
defeat our rival in the state, the University of Texas. It has now
turned into an act of kinship, an act of love, and an act of
friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for Texas A&AMP;M, the nation's third-largest public
land-grant university with more than 43,000 students, the bonfire
is a revered tradition, and some students said Thursday that it
should be held despite the accident. The first was set ablaze in
1909, and until now the tradition had been interrupted only once,
after the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963. In 1994, the
structure collapsed after torrential rains caused the ground to
shift, but no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   University officials estimate that harvesting the logs and
building the bonfire structure involves 125,000 work hours by about
5,000 students. Students take training classes to participate in
the harvest _ or the cut, as it is known on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Cranes and tractors lift the logs, which are then tied together
with baling wire. The structure, which this year would have
included about 7,000 logs, is designed to twist inward and collapse
on itself as it burns.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1970, when school officials limited the height of the
structure to 55 feet, students had built towers as high as 110
feet.
</P>
<P>
   This year, construction began on Nov. 5 when the guiding center
pole was placed in the ground. In keeping with tradition, student
guards have since patrolled the site 24 hours a day. Traditionally,
the week before the bonfire is known as Push, as in pushing to
finish the job, and students were working in round-the-clock shifts
to complete the tower. Before the accident, students had erected
about 40 feet of the tower.
</P>
<P>
   Often teased for its traditions by outsiders, particularly
anyone affiliated with the University of Texas, Texas A&AMP;M students
and alumni say traditions like the bonfire create a bond and a
kinship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to view the world through maroon-colored glasses,''
said Brent Adam, a New York stock trader who oversees an alumni
group known as the Wall Street Aggies. He said news of the accident
had quickly spread among alumni everywhere. ``I've had people from
all sides of the planet e-mail today,'' Adam said.

MORE SOCIAL WORKERS IN KC SCHOOLS TO PREVENT CHILD-ABUSE DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONNA MCGUIRE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In response to the deaths of two Kansas City
brothers, the Missouri Division of Family Services plans to put
more social workers in Kansas City schools _ probably within the
next month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, DFS officials have been meeting with community
leaders this week to build better relationships and develop ideas
for preventing other child-abuse deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The Ad Hoc Group Against Crime, the Heart of America United Way,
the Local Investment Commission, the Kansas City Police Department
and a local minister were among those contacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking them to be part of the solution,'' Denise Cross,
the statewide DFS director, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   DFS already has seven staff members in Jackson County schools.
Three additional social workers based in schools receive part of
their salary from DFS and part from the district in which they
work.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of the social workers' jobs is to prevent child
abuse and neglect. They currently work with seven districts,
including Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Benjamin Demps Jr., a former social services
director in Oklahoma, has said every school could benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the children are is where the help should be,'' district
spokesman David A. Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Cross has asked Demps to determine which schools have the
greatest need. Rather than hire new workers, she plans to transfer
current staff into the schools. DFS has 263 social workers in
Jackson County.
</P>
<P>
   DFS had received calls about Larry and Gary Bass for years,
including many calls from Kansas City teachers. After receiving
another hot-line call this fall, DFS again sent a case worker to
the Bass home. Told that the boys no longer lived there, the worker
left without seeing them. The 8-year-old brothers, two of a set of
triplets, died in October from long-term starvation and infected
burns.
</P>
<P>
   Three DFS employees are under 20-day, unpaid suspensions for
failing to do their jobs properly.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' mother, Mary Bass, 31, has been charged with child
abuse and two counts of second-degree murder. Her boyfriend, Tony
Dixon, 36, also faces six counts of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Cross described her staff as discouraged, sorrowful, in grief
and frustrated over what has happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe we have to take a hard look (at how cases are
handled) and be willing to change,'' Cross said. ``But it's
difficult, especially when you have folks out there every day in
crisis situations.'' .MDSD/

NOTHING MUDDIES GROWTH AT FAIR GROUNDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the reasons for the recent success of the racing season
at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans can be found by taking a 25-mile
trip up the Mississippi River toward Baton Rouge. It's a place
called the Bonnet Carre Spillway, where a muddy river bank has laid
the foundation for a track that's increasingly visited by this
country's top trainers.
</P>
<P>
   They scoop the muddy stuff up, haul it back to New Orleans and
lay it on their racetrack. And it turns out to work pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been blessed,'' Fair Grounds racing secretary Mervin
Muniz said. ``The dirt here has the right amount of clay and
sand.''
</P>
<P>
   The planets certainly have lined up at the Fair Grounds, which
starts its racing season on Thanksgiving Day and works on a
Thursday through Monday schedule into March.
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of tracks racing in the spring and summer
months, but the list grows shorter during the fall and winter when
Fair Grounds comes on line. The place becomes even more attractive
with the weather in New Orleans _ in contrast to the New York
winter at Aqueduct.
</P>
<P>
   And because the early months of the year are when trainers are
bearing down on their 3-year-olds while trying to find a classic
winner, it doesn't hurt to have a surface that's kind to a horse.
Fair Grounds has that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to prep a good string of 3-year-olds at the Fair
Grounds just because of the racing surface,'' D. Wayne Lukas said.
``No other reason. It's certainly not because of the atmosphere or
the purses.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Lukas _ a workaholic _ has no use for the Quarter. He's not
a big fan of the old Gentilly neighborhood that surrounds the
track. And the purses aren't at the top of his list, although he
would take that $500,000 bonus they're paying for any horse who can
sweep the Louisiana Derby and the Kentucky Derby. He'd have won it,
if it had been available, in 1996 with Grindstone.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities have attracted Bob Baffert, who's expected to
bring in 20 horses, compared to Lukas' 40. Michael Dickinson, the
trainer of Da Hoss fame, joins Baffert as a first-timer setting up
shop at Fair Grounds. Rusty Arnold is another new face. He comes
from New York with some horses owned by G. Watts Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   It's only fitting that something as unlikely as Mississippi
River mud has played a key part to the racing at Fair Grounds.
Remember, this is the place that started making a place for itself
when its grandstand burned down in 1993 and people had to watch the
races out of a tent.
</P>
<P>
   Without a grandstand, the place became a TV studio. Because it's
one of the limited number of tracks racing at that time of year, it
has caught a lot of demand through simulcast players looking for
some track to play.
</P>
<P>
   Average daily wagering has increased six consecutive racing
seasons. Over that time, wagering has gone up 200 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Purses, which averaged $263,000 per day last year, are expected
to hit $275,000 from the start of the meet.
</P>
<P>
   So, even if you don't like jazz or humidity, there could be
worse places to spend the winter than the Fair Grounds.
LATE SCRATCHES
Nasal strips in Texas Nasal strips will be permitted in Texas
starting Nov. 26. Texas joins Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana and
Oklahoma as states that have approved the nasal strips. California
and New York have yet to approve them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will treat nasal strips in the same manner as tongue ties
for the short term while monitoring their use,'' Texas Racing
Commission executive secretary Paula Flowerday said.
</P>
<P>
   That means the commission is not requiring their use be
announced to the public. Corey Johnsen, general manager at Lone
Star Park at Grand Prairie, said the local track will not institute
house rules dictating the use of nasal strips be announced to the
public.
Van Berg returning It looks as if Hall of Fame trainer Jack Van
Berg might be stabling at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie for next
year's thoroughbred season. The Lone Star racing office has been
extending an invitation to Van Berg each year the track has
operated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd come over there with a 20-horse string,'' said Van Berg,
contacted at his barn at Hollywood Park. ``We might do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be the first time Van Berg has accepted stalls in Texas
since the opening season at Retama Park in 1995. Ralph Irwin was
Van Berg's assistant at the time, but Van Berg said he wasn't sure
who would handle his horses if he sent them to Lone Star. Cat Thief
runs A decision on Cat Thief's next race could be made when he
breezes Monday at Churchill Downs. The Breeders' Cup Classic winner
could get one more start before he heads off to California for an
expected run in Santa Anita's Strub Series for 4-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   That race would be the $400,000 Clark Handicap on Nov. 26 at
Churchill. It's never a cakewalk for an unpredictable horse like
Cat Thief, and he would face a tough cast in the Clark if horses
such as Pleasant Breeze (front-running Meadowlands Cup winner owned
by Bill Clifton of Waco), Da Devil and Chester House show up. Da
Devil beat Cat Thief in the Kentucky Cup Classic, and Chester House
closed on Cat Thief and finished fourth in the Breeders' Cup
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas hasn't ruled out a possible run with Cat Thief in
the $5 million Dubai World Cup in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never tried it, but I have been watching to see how the
other trainers have prepped their horses for that trip,'' Lukas
said. Daylami gets award Because he raced only once in North
America, Daylami might get shut out of an Eclipse Award. Based on
his impressive victory in the Breeders' Cup Turf, Daylami might yet
get the nod for Turf horse over Breeders' Cup Mile winner Silic.
</P>
<P>
   That's OK for the handlers of Daylami. They got their big prize
this week when Daylami was selected horse of the year in Europe.
Although he ran up the track in the Arc de Triomphe, his three
other Group I victories made him an easy choice. He has been
retired with earnings of more than $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Saeed bin Suroor, who trained Daylami, should get an award for
understatement of the year. After hearing that Daylami was selected
champion in Europe, the trainer said, ``He deserved it.'' SPOTLIGHT
ON Pincay is closing fast on Shoemaker's record Michael Wrona finds
himself in a familiar position. And it's not just because he's back
in the announcer's booth at Hollywood Park, where the Australian
made his American debut calling the races at the start of this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Wrona, who returned to Hollywood this year, again is in a
position to describe something historic to horse racing fans. He
called Cigar's victory at Arlington International in 1996 when the
horse tied Citation's modern record for consecutive victories. And
now he'll call the moment when Bill Shoemaker's all-time record for
wins by a jockey is eclipsed if Laffit Pincay Jr. keeps winning at
his current pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just so hot at the moment,'' Wrona said. ``His win rate
right now is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Pincay, 52, needs 15 more victories to equal Shoe's mark of
8,833. He has won seven races through the first seven days at
Hollywood. Even if he cools off, he can break the record at
Hollywood, which has 24 more days until the season ends Dec. 20.
</P>
<P>
   At Arlington, Wrona had some time to think about Cigar's run at
the record. It's uncertain in which race Pincay will bring down the
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't normally go into a race rehearsed,'' Wrona said. ``I
did have some things on my mind for Cigar. But I haven't put a
second into a game plan for Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that I'll have to file away among the
kaleidoscope of jockey's silks, but it will weigh on my mind as he
gets closer.''
INSIDE THE NUMBERS Betting explosion at Fair Grounds The grandstand
at Fair Grounds in New Orleans burned to the ground in December
1993 and wasn't rebuilt until November 1997. That did nothing to
stop average daily wagering at the track, largely because of the
business the track did by offering its racing for simulcast
betting. Fair Grounds opens its season on Thanksgiving Day. Season

STOWERS INSTITUTE NAMES FIRST FOUR MEMBERS OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY AND LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When biologist Robert Krumlauf was at a
scientific conference in France, he let it be known he was leaving
his prestigious position at the National Institute for Medical
Research in London for a job in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   His international colleagues scoffed. What was in Kansas, they
asked, besides Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz and tornadoes?
</P>
<P>
   Krumlauf's answer: the Stowers Institute for Medical Research,
which of course is in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   As its new scientific director, Krumlauf, 51, will assemble a
team of top researchers to work together on some of the fundamental
questions of the life sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``An opportunity of this magnitude doesn't come along very
often,'' Krumlauf said Thursday as he and the first three
scientists hired by the institute were introduced at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Stowers Institute, founded by James and Virginia Stowers, is
expected to open in about a year, with up to 10 scientists leading
teams of researchers.
</P>
<P>
   With an endowment from the Stowerses of $340 million, which is
expected to grow substantially, the institute will study the role
of genes in regulating biological processes and causing disease.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders hope the institute will serve as a catalyst to turn
Kansas City into a leading center for biomedical research and
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Krumlauf and Leanne Wiedemann, his wife and fellow biologist,
are both originally from the Midwest. They met while graduate
students at Ohio State University and have worked in London for
about 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Wiedemann, 45, will also be a research scientist at Stowers. She
said they were somewhat skeptical at first about the offer to move
to Kansas City but quickly changed their minds after seeing the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know if we could live in Kansas City,'' she said.
``It took about a day and a half to be convinced.''
</P>
<P>
   She praised the area for its high quality of life. Her main
concerns now are deciding where to live and what school their son
should attend.
</P>
<P>
   Krumlauf said he was drawn to the job by the promise of
state-of-the-art technology and a work environment in which
scientists from many disciplines will collaborate.
</P>
<P>
   When James Stowers, who founded American Century Investments,
told Krumlauf the institute would foster a collegial atmosphere,
``this was music to my ears,'' Krumlauf recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I've really benefited from the collegial environment
(in London),'' he said. ``I was as happy when other people made
discoveries as when I made them. I want to train others this way.''
</P>
<P>
   James Coffman, a 40-year-old researcher at the California
Institute of Technology, was named Thursday as one of two assistant
research scientists at the Stowers Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The other is Linheng Li, 41, a scientist at the University of
Washington School of Medicine in Seattle. He studies the immune
system and blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   The two were chosen from an international applicant pool of
about 175 scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Coffman said he looked forward to scientists working together to
answer basic biological questions. And that collaboration won't
just be on the Stowers campus.
</P>
<P>
   Just south of the Stowers Institute is the School of Biological
Sciences at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. There,
associate professor Brian Livingston runs a laboratory where he is
mapping the gene structure of the sea urchin.
</P>
<P>
   Coffman studies how genes regulate development in the sea
urchin.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the nice things about moving here is that Brian
(Livingston) will be right across the street,'' Coffman said.
</P>
<P>
   When talking about centers of life science research, ``Kansas
City isn't the first place to come to mind,'' Coffman said. ``But
the benefits of the institute far outweigh any disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   He likes the money and technology for research the institute
will provide. Stowers researchers will not be required to seek
outside grants to finance their laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dream come true,'' Coffman said. ``The ability to do
research in a facility like this...''
</P>
<P>
   Coffman and Li both expect to bring some researchers with them
from their laboratories on the West Coast. But they will also hire
technical assistants in Kansas City and choose area graduate
students as research assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City doesn't have a big research community, but I like
the (institute's) vision of the future,'' Li said.
</P>
<P>
   Krumlauf studies a group of genes common to humans and other
animals that are sometimes referred to as ``master regulatory
genes'' because they control other genes.
</P>
<P>
   The genes contained in each cell of the body provide the
chemical ``blueprint'' controlling the body's growth, repair and
functions.
</P>
<P>
   Regulatory genes play an important role in how the nervous and
digestive systems, the limbs and skeleton of an organism are shaped
as it grows from a single cell.
</P>
<P>
   Wiedemann researches how changes in certain human genes may lead
to the development of leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   While they pursued their work separately, the two discovered
quite by accident that they might be traveling the same path. One
of the regulatory genes Krumlauf is studying also appears to play a
role in the development of leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea,'' Krumlauf said. ``It was not intentional.
It's part of the joy and surprise of science. You never know where
it will take you.''
</P>
<P>
   While the research to be done at Stowers may seem obscure, it
eventually will yield practical results, Krumlauf said.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs and therapies becoming available now are the fruit of
basic research done five, 10, even 20 years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to do is lay the groundwork for the
discoveries that will take us through the next century,'' Krumlauf
said.
</P>
<P>
   But before Krumlauf can work on any of these weighty questions
of science at Stowers, he has a more mundane problem to solve: how
to move several thousand lab mice across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``To create them would be an enormous expense,'' he said. For
some mice, he'll be able to collect and freeze sperm or embryos to
ship to Kansas City. But others will have to suffer jet lag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still think we may have to transfer 2,000 to 3,000,''
Krumlauf said. ``Logistically, it's a nightmare.''

RETURN TO LOCAL CONTROL PUTS KC SCHOOL BOARD IN SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN HOFFMAN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Members of the Kansas City Board of Education
now have the freedom they have longed for.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom from a judge telling them how to run district schools.
No more scrutiny from a court-appointed committee.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple to
dismiss the 22-year-old desegregation case returns the district to
local control.
</P>
<P>
   But with that independence comes a heavy mission.
</P>
<P>
   The district must improve the education of youth quickly to
regain state accreditation. If academic performance isn't improved
within two years, the district faces a possible takeover from state
education officials. The school board could be removed.
</P>
<P>
   All nine school board members say it is up to Superintendent
Benjamin Demps Jr. to lead the effort to regain accreditation. But
board members know they, too, are in the spotlight and have
important policy roles to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no one else to turn to if it fails,'' board member
Lance Loewenstein said. ``We will be solely responsible for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most board members said the key to success is simple. Stay out
of the way and let Demps do his job.
</P>
<P>
   But can they?
</P>
<P>
   The board frequently has engaged in public disputes and has been
accused by the federal court of making decisions based on narrow
agendas and meddling where it shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   How can it save the district?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's is no, `Can we?' '' said board member Connie Clark,
who represents the district's east side. ``We must.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark described the board as the strongest and most united
district board in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Kurtz, an at-large member, said the board already
participated in workshops on how to work together and recognize the
role of the superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really builds a team between the board and the
superintendent,'' she said. ``It pulls the board away from a
micromanaging role.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Kurtz was critical of the board for its past
transgressions, she also understood that many factors made it easy
to fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like to simplify this and say, `` `That board doesn't
know how to do its job,' '' she said, adding that most people don't
realize the bureaucracy that entangled the district during the
desegregation case. ``I don't believe there is a district in the
country that could do the things we were asked to do.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is one reason that the current board believes the
future will be better than the past, it is Demps. The board members
agreed that they are united behind the superintendent, something
the district has not seen in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect members to resemble a church choir when it
comes to its board meetings. The public sparring will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is messy, and it's messy for a reason,'' Loewenstein
said. ``Publicly elected officials are going to have divergent
views, and those views are not going to be silenced.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean the group is incapable of making good
decisions, Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nine individuals with nine individual opinions,'' she
said. ``But when it comes down to decisions that affect the
children, we agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Several board members said that they think the decision
Wednesday will help the panel make better decisions. Under the
court's control, they said, the board too often relaxed and let the
Desegregation Monitoring Committee do the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easy for elected officials to sit back and say, `I
don't have to worry about that, the DMC will catch it,' ''
Loewenstein said. ``We've been used to daddy making the decisions
for us. Daddy is gone.''

NUMBER OF CHARTER SCHOOLS IN KC MAY DOUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The number of charter schools operating in
the Kansas City School District could more than double to nearly 40
as early as next year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with The Learning Exchange said they are working with
groups interested in opening 20 more of the schools, which are
publicly funded but operate free of many local and state
regulations. Fifteen charter schools began operating this year and
two more already are approved to open during the 2000-2001 school
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I can safely say is there is the demand out there on
behalf of parents and families in this community to have that
option available to them,'' said Tammy Blossom, director of
strategic ventures for The Learning Exchange, which serves as a
central resource for charter school information and assistance.
``Are 40 charter schools good for our city? There certainly seems
to be the demand for those schools.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kansas City district officials have argued that the
competition from charters makes it unlikely the district will be
able to regain accreditation. On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge
Dean Whipple refused to block a state Board of Education decision
last month to strip the district of accreditation as of May 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things the charter school movement is doing is
siphoning off some of our children,'' said David Smith, a district
spokesman. ``But it's not going to solve the needs of all the
children of the district and it may, in fact, hurt some children if
it continues to take away the resources of the district.''
</P>
<P>
   Blossom said interested groups include public school parents,
educators and community groups and several private management
firms. Edison Schools Inc. and School Futures Research Foundation,
which already operate charter schools in Kansas City, are among
those hoping to open additional schools, Blossom said.
</P>
<P>
   She said it is still too early to know how many students the
schools could accommodate or what grade levels they would serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of that is going to be driven by the buildings they
get,'' Blossom said.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups are still in the formative stages while others have
completed their formal applications. In addition, the groups have
yet to identify a college or university willing to sponsor their
charters.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, only the school district, Central Missouri
State University, the University of Missouri-Kansas City and the
Metropolitan Area Community Colleges can sponsor charter schools in
Kansas City. Sponsors are charged with holding the charter schools
accountable for their financial and academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   Until about a month ago, Blossom said, the sponsors were
considering a moratorium on any additional charter schools because
of a lack of money and personnel needed to conduct such oversight.
</P>
<P>
   That thinking began to change when the state Board of Education
voted in October to strip the Kansas City School District of
accreditation for failing to meet state Missouri performance
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to go back and reassess,'' Blossom said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Oliver, dean of the school of education at the
University of Missouri-Kansas City, said the school may be
interested in sponsoring two to five more charters, but questioned
whether UMKC had the resources to do so. UMKC currently sponsors
five charters and is responsible for the cost of evaluating and
assessing the performance of the schools.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors plan to meet again in a few weeks to discuss their
options.
</P>
<P>
   Should the colleges and universities choose not to sponsor any
of the new charters, that burden would fall to the state Department
of Elementary and Secondary Education, Blossom said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they've met all the legal obligations in the legislation,
the state department is put in a position of having to charter
these schools,'' Blossom said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Education Commissioner Robert Bartman adopted a
wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we'll have to deal with when it
materializes,'' Bartman said.
</P>
<P>
   If all 20 schools open, Kansas City would continue to rank among
the fastest-growing areas in the charter school movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're certainly having some of the most rapid expansion, I
wouldn't argue with that,'' said Alex Medler, a program analyst in
the U.S. Department of Education's charter schools program. ``There
are other cities with pretty similar levels of growth, but not a
lot of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Exchange said applicants cite a number of reasons
for wanting to open charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   Parent interest in charters surged in the weeks since the
announcement the district would lose its state accreditation.
Charter schools are not accredited, but applicants see other
advantages to charters, including a desire for smaller schools that
offer more individual attention for students.

TEXAS TECH MAY PURSUE CLEMSON ASSISTANT IF DYKES RETIRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indications of Spike Dykes' retirement as Texas Tech football
coach intensified yesterday as speculation surfaced about a
possible successor. Athletic director Gerald Myers confirmed Dykes'
future plans would be addressed after tomorrow's game against
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what those plans might be, Myers said: ``At this point, I
can't say. We'll be visiting and talking after the game. That's
what he wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers and Tech chancellor John Montford declined comment about a
report in the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal that a Tech representative
contacted Clemson offensive coordinator Rich Rodriguez about
succeeding Dykes, 61. Rodriguez, 36, has been the architect of
significant offensive turnarounds at Tulane and Clemson over the
past three seasons and spent 1990-96 as the head football coach at
Glenville (W.Va.) State College, an NAIA school.
</P>
<P>
   During a Tuesday news conference in Clemson, S.C., Rodriguez
confirmed he had been approached by a NCAA Division I-A school
about a head coaching opportunity but declined to name the school.
Citing unnamed sources, the Avalanche-Journal identified that
school as Texas Tech in yesterday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson coach Tommy Bowden said Rodriguez has been granted
permission to talk to representatives from other schools about head
coaching vacancies after the Tigers (5-5) conclude their regular
season Saturday against South Carolina (0-10). Bowden declined to
identify the school that expressed interest in Rodriguez, saying
only that it was not Louisiana State.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez could not be reached for comment yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the nation's 114 Division I-A colleges, the only three
with existing vacancies are LSU, Tulsa and North Carolina. Tech
would join that list if Dykes announces his retirement. Privately,
several individuals with ties to the Tech athletic department said
they expect Dykes to retire after the Red Raiders (5-5, 4-3) meet
Oklahoma (6-3, 4-2) at 11:30 a.m. tomorrow in Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   Dykes, the winningest coach in school history (81-67-1), said he
is considering retirement but said he would not discuss the
situation until after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy is, if you sign on for a season, you finish that
season before you think about something else,'' said Dykes, whose
contract ends after the 2000 season. ``I understand rumors. I know
what goes on. I wasn't born yesterday. But this is not the time or
place to do it \Rretire\S. We still have a game to play.''

DEION SANDERS' RETURN TO REDS POSSIBLE, SOURCE SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cornerback/punt returner/preacher Deion Sanders
has been considered one of the most versatile players, if not the
most versatile, in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   And now Sanders is seriously contemplating becoming
cornerback/punt returner/preacher/outfielder again.
</P>
<P>
   A source says that Sanders' agent, Eugene Parker, recently
notified Cincinnati Reds general manager Jim Bowden about the
player's interest in returning to baseball in 2000. The Reds added
Sanders to their 40-man roster for spring training, The Associated
Press reported yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who played with four teams in parts of eight seasons of
baseball, last played in 1997 when he finished second in the
National League in stolen bases with the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bowden nor Parker could be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said his primary focus is on football right now and said
he hasn't made any decisions. He said that a lot of things would
have to take place for him to play baseball again. But he admitted
an interest in returning to the sport where, unlike football, he
still has ``something to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   What's also unproven is whether Sanders will be able to return
to baseball and still continue his football career as a member of
the Cowboys, which is what he would like to do.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders plans to make the North Texas area his permanent home.
He is building a new 35,000 square-foot home in Prosper and has a
budding ministry here.
</P>
<P>
   But despite signing a five-year, $52.5 million contract
extension this past summer, coming back to the Cowboys next year is
not a certainty. Sanders' deal will likely be voided at the end of
the season because the Cowboys need to clear room under the salary
cap.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who acknowledged some surprise when
he learned of Sanders' interest in playing baseball, said he wants
Sanders to finish his career with the Cowboys. But Jones said he
would prefer that the 11-year veteran Sanders limit his athletic
versatility to the football field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do want him back in the future,'' Jones said. ``I would
prefer at this stage in his career for him to just play football.''
</P>
<P>
   Choosing his words carefully, Jones, however, said that playing
baseball wouldn't prohibit Sanders from playing football with the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it apparently will be one of the factors when Jones and
Parker renegotiate a contract for Sanders after this season. While
there was an understanding between Jones and Sanders that he would
quit baseball after the 1997 season, Jones acknowledged that no
promises were made that Sanders would never return to baseball. He
said the subject was not discussed during last summer's contract
negotiations, which were focused around clearing salary cap room
and Sanders career-threatening toe surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't thought about him playing both,'' Jones said.
``It was not an issue this year. The contract this year was about
getting him on the field and clearing cap room for us. He worked
well with us on that. If everything was successful, then we would
sit down and look at the future. The contract allows us to do that
and him to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has already made $3.5 million in bonus money this year
and has a base salary of $3 million. He could earn another $1.5
million in incentives if he plays in 70 percent of the Cowboys'
defensive plays and makes the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   His base salary jumps to $10.5 million in 2000, $13 million in
2001, $11.5 million in 2002 and $10 million in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys would likely reward Sanders with a huge signing
bonus on a multiyear deal that would still pro-rate to a $10
million annual salary that fits Sanders' market value. But baseball
will certainly have an impact on an offer.
</P>
<P>
   If Sanders can't make up the difference with a decent contract
from the Reds, the two-sport dream probably won't last long.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders referred all talk about contracts to his agent. Sanders
said his only concern right now is helping the Cowboys win.
Sanders, who has been slowed by a hamstring injury for the past
three games before straining his groin Sunday, is listed as
questionable for Sunday's game against the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't play, people say I'm not there for the team,''
Sanders said. ``I play and now they talk about people picking on me
and me losing my reputation. The other so-called great cornerbacks
around the league give up touchdowns every week and nobody says
anything. I just need to take \Ran interception\S back and do my
dance and everybody will shut up.''

THREE BOYS SENTENCED IN SEXUAL ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ Two 14-year-old Kansas City, Kan., boys were
sentenced Thursday to the custody of state juvenile authorities for
sexually assaulting twin 6-year-old girls at a day-care facility
last May, an assistant Wyandotte County District Attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant district attorney, Chris Schneider, said a
12-year-old boy was sentenced to 18 months probation.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sentencing hearing in Juvenile Court was closed,
Kansas law provides that significant developments can be disclosed
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old boy and the 14-year-old boys had pleaded guilty
earlier to two counts each of aggravated sodomy. They were charged
with additional counts initially, but prosecutors dismissed the
other counts as part of plea bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider said the 14-year-old boys could be placed in a group
home, foster care or even in their own home _ whichever juvenile
authorities deem appropriate. How long they are in custody is also
up to the discretion of juvenile authorities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other boys, each 13, also have pleaded guilty in the case.
One was placed on probation for 18 months; the other is to be
sentenced Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The day-care facility where the assaults occurred on May 15
consisted of two houses on adjoining lots.
</P>
<P>
   The twins told police they had been playing on swings and the
boys had been playing basketball before the assaults. The assaults
took place in a backyard shed and in the basement of one of the
houses, the girls said.
</P>
<P>
   Wyandotte County District Attorney Nick Tomasic said at the time
that the day-care operator, Margaret Hardridge, was on the
premises, possibly inside one of the houses, at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The state ordered the facility closed.
</P>
<P>
   Hardridge, 55, is charged with one felony count of aiding a
felon for suggesting witnesses change their stories, two
misdemeanor counts of endangering a child and a misdemeanor count
of violating child-care regulations. She is free on bond while
awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   The girls told their mother about the assaults after their
mother picked them up from the center the day after the incident.
The mother had taken the girls to the center on back-to-back days,
but they didn't tell her about the assaults the day they happened.
</P>
<P>
   Tomasic said one of the girls was severely traumatized.

The collapse was due any moment, as if an old railroad man was
standing on a platform looking at a pocket watch. There probably
should have been a whistle in the distance, a rumble as it
approached.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It comes every night, right on time.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the Rockets seemed so sure, so in control, it was
easy to forget. The Rockets fell apart as if by federal regulation,
blowing another fourth-quarter lead on cue to get blown out by the
Sacramento Kings 128-110 before 14,898 at Compaq Center on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets fell to 0-6 at home, their worst home start to a
season since moving to The Summit/Compaq Center in 1975. The Kings'
128 points were the most by a Rockets opponent since 1995. The loss
ended the Rockets' 11-game winning streak against the Kings, the
longest they had held against any opponent.
</P>
<P>
   But even with futility records falling as fast as the Rockets,
the night was fairly typical of the team's fourth-quarter
nightmares. That did not make it any easier to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as usual the fourth quarter,'' Rockets guard Steve
Francis said. ``We were good for three quarters and fell apart in
the fourth quarter. I can't tell you what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not alone in his bewilderment. And there were much older
minds similarly stumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the game and our team, you can see how we can
make the game simple and at the same time difficult,'' Rockets
center Hakeem Olajuwon said. ``We compete and compete and come out
on the losing end. It's frustrating. I can't put my finger on why
we can't finish.''
</P>
<P>
   It has happened in one form or another in every home game, as if
the Rockets' lack of poise or the Fates refuse to allow them to win
in the old arena until the city reconsiders the Rockets' plea to
get a new one.
</P>
<P>
   But this one was perhaps the most baffling.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets rushed to a seven-point lead in the first minutes of
the fourth quarter. Tony Massenburg took a high-speed, no-look pass
from Cuttino Mobley and slammed it over Kings reserve Scot Pollard
for a three-point play.
</P>
<P>
   With the Kings holding off on double-teaming until the fourth
quarter, Olajuwon had his shot going as he had not all season,
making 13 of 20 shots for 30 points through three quarters. Charles
Barkley had been dominating the boards, grabbing 15 rebounds and
scoring 14 points in three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   And though Jason Williams, celebrating his 24th birthday, had
rolled to 23 points and 10 assists, the rest of the Kings starters
had made just 14 of 34 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they jumped on us early,'' Kings coach Rick Adelman
said of the Rockets' early 16-point lead, ``I thought it was going
to be a long night.''
</P>
<P>
   But trailing by seven with just more than 10 minutes to play,
and with their starting lineup on the bench, the Kings took off on
a 17-1 run to rival anything the Pacers or Lakers came up with to
blow past the Rockets in previous late collapses.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting 54 percent when they went up by seven, the Rockets
missed 13 consecutive shots and mixed in four turnovers in a span
of seven minutes. The Kings pushed their run to 32-7 without
calling their starters back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring easily all night, the Rockets could make just six
of 23 shots (26.1 percent) in the fourth quarter, missing all of
their seven 3-pointers. They committed six turnovers. The Kings got
68 points off the bench; Bryce Drew and Mobley continued to
struggle with their shots, making six of 21 shots and one of eight
3s in a combined 58 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon had one fourth-quarter point, Barkley one rebound and
two points. After scoring 37 points in the first quarter, the
Rockets scored 16 in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter who it was, I see us not able to knock down
shots,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``I don't know if
it's psychological or what it is. They're there. Not one guy could
make a shot. We get to the basket and could not make a layup. It's
baffling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shots are there. These things go in cycles. We don't have
people making any shots at all, especially in crunch time.''
</P>
<P>
   But as they have so often, the Rockets offered glimpses of what
they still insist could be.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon started well, making four of six shots, and he was far
from alone. The Rockets rolled to 37 points in the first quarter,
more than they have scored in many halves, and six points more than
their previous best quarter of the season, the 31-point first
period against the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   But from the start of the second quarter, the Kings regained
their offensive form. When Williams caught the Rockets dipping
behind high screens, he stepped back to launch 3s. Jon Barry and
Predrag Stojakovic began hitting outside. And when the Rockets
began turning the ball over, the Kings burned them, turning 20
turnovers into 29 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings started the second quarter with a 15-4 run, reducing
the Rockets' lead to three. But once the Kings began firing, the
Rockets were in a shootout with some of the NBA's top gunners.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the Rockets regained at least some of their
first-half control in the third quarter, the Kings rallied again,
scoring 19 points in five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Even more troubling, with 1:04 left in the quarter, Francis blew
past Williams and, while completing a drive to a 92-91 lead,
collided with Pollard. Francis bruised his left leg and remained
down long enough for it to seem as if he would not return.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with Olajuwon and Barkley resting and Francis out (he did
return to play six minutes in the fourth quarter), the Rockets made
a run.
</P>
<P>
   But as they have so often, the Rockets lost their shooting touch
late and were no better at the other end. The Kings made 11 of
their last 19 shots. Trailing by as many as 16 points in the first
half, the Kings scored 105 points in three quarters to lead by as
many as 20.

<P>
   BROKER-DEATHS (New York) _ The Oct. 25 killing in New Jersey of
two stock promoters exposes a seamier side of Wall Street, a world
of low-priced stocks and high-priced dreams, of grimy offices and
sham companies, of swindlers and touts who prey on average people
trying to grab the brass ring in the greatest bull market in
American history. A primer on how the deals are done. By Leslie
Eaton.

   SCI-ORGAN-TRANSPLANTS (Washington) _ A bitter fight over
whether, and how, to restructure the nation's system for
distributing donated human organs has erupted in Congress, and a
deal struck last week that would have cleared the way for the
Clinton administration's long-planned overhaul is on the verge of
falling apart. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.

   OBIT-BOWLES (Undated) _ Paul Bowles, the novelist, composer,
poet and quintessential outsider of American literature, died of a
heart attack Thursday in a hospital in Tangier, Morocco. He was 88,
and throughout his extraordinary career evoked a world of dark
Moroccan streets and scorching deserts, a haze of hashish and
drug-induced visions. By Mel Gussow.

   BUSH-FOREIGN-POLICY (Washington) _ For more than two hours on
Monday afternoon, and then again on Monday night, and then again on
Tuesday afternoon, several of George W. Bush's leading foreign
policy advisers and a few of his top aides sat with him and trotted
the globe: Russia, China, North Korea, Iraq. Their principal
mission was the finishing touches on a foreign policy speech that
Bush is scheduled to give Friday. But there was another, equally
important goal: the ongoing education of Bush on international
affairs. By Frank Bruni.

</P>
<P>
   SPEND-CONGRESS-ASSESS _ For all of the partisanship and intense
wrangling of the past 10 days, the budget agreement between
President Clinton and the Republican-run Congress ended up being
most remarkable for its moderation. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   KOHL-PROFILE _ Sen. Herb Kohl hardly resembles the prototypical
senator. He displays not a smidge of pomposity, pretension or
bombast. He is rather shy and shuns the spotlight, and on the few
occasions when he speaks out, he talks softly and tends to look at
his feet. But on Thursday night, Kohl, objecting to a milk-price
feature of the final spending bill of the year, announced that he
would do everything in his power to obstruct and delay the
adjournment of the Senate for as long as possible unless he
received concessions on the dairy issue. This could keep the Senate
in session through the weekend, if not longer. By David E.
Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   PORK-CONGRESS _ _ It was a throw-away line on NBC's ``West
Wing,'' biting in its indictment of an inventive, sometimes
outlandish bid by Congress to spend taxpayer money. There, amid a
list of appropriations requests recited by a fictional White House
aide, was a gem: $2 million to monitor Alaskan skies for volcanic
ash. ``There are volcanos in Alaska?'' a ``West Wing'' aide asked,
smirking. Cue laughter and eye-rolling. But in the
chandelier-studded offices of Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who as
chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee controls billions
of dollars, the joke was not funny. That is because the item was
not a made-up bit of drama, something writers of the series knew
when they used it. It was a genuine Stevens request and a sparkling
example of the senator's mastery at steering copious amounts of
money to his home state.

   AIRCRASH-EGYPT (Cairo) _ There is a deep sense of popular anger
in Egypt over the American handling of the crash investigation of
Flight 990. By Douglas Jehl.

</P>
<P>
   LIVING-WAGE-LAWS (Los Angeles) _ Here and elsewhere, a small but
increasing number of employers who do business with government are
suddenly finding themselves required by local ordinances to grant
big raises and benefits to their low-wage workers. Forty cities and
counties in 17 states have enacted living-wage laws since the
movement began five years ago. Lately the movement has begun to
broaden into a wide range of requirements involving health
insurance, vacations, sick pay, job security and incentives to
unionize. By Louis Uchitelle.

   1968-NORRIS-COLUMN _ It's beginning to feel a lot like 1968.
Back then, the economy was barreling along, nearing the end of what
was to be the longest period without a recession in American
history. Now, the 1961-69 expansion will be replaced as the longest
period of growth ever if the United States gets through the winter
without a recession. By Floyd Norris.

about exploiting these digital technologies. By Rick Lyman.

Connecticut, Tennessee, Louisiana Tech, Rutgers, Georgia and UCLA,

   &UR; WEEKEND (Moved in ``e'' category) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BODY-ART-EXHIBIT (New York) _ ``Body Art: Marks of Identity,''
at the American Museum of Natural History, is a transparent effort
on the part of a family-style institution to heat up its image and
pull in a fresh audience, one that probably couldn't care less
about large, extinct reptiles with tiny brains. The theme is
personal adornment of the most intimate kind, usually applied
directly onto or into the skin. The exhibition _ smart, extremely
entertaining and assembled in record time _ is geared to the
current fashion-as-art vogue. The packed installation offers just
enough bare, multicultural flesh to inspire viewer rubbernecking,
without actually being an adults-only affair. By Holland Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   GULBENKIAN-COLLECTION (New York) _ What is there to be said
about the Metropolitan Museum of Art's wonderful exhibition of
treasures from the legendary collection that Calouste Gulbenkian
assiduously brought into being in the first half of this century,
and then left to the world in the form a private museum in Lisbon
where he spent the last dozen years of his life? See it, enjoy it,
pore over its every object from beginning to end, that is, from a
17th-century Armenian illuminated Bible to a vitrine of three
Japanese lacquers. In between lie extraordinary examples of Islamic
and Turkish textiles and ceramics, 18th-century silver, European
painting and the Art Nouveau jewelry of Rene Lalique. Glean all you
can about the many forms that visual power can take, and the spells
they cast on generation after generation down through time. By
Roberta Smith.

LAKERS FALL TO NUGGETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Charting the Los Angeles Lakers' least-inspired game of
the season required more than a box score. It took a calendar and a
minute-by-minute transcript to plot the myriad points where players
took turns self-destructing.
</P>
<P>
   They lost 93-82 Thursday night to a sub-.500 but clearly
inspired Denver Nuggets team. Explanations were hard to come by,
but theories abounded, as the Lakers cited turning points that
ranged from the opening minutes of the third quarter to the
practice session held 33 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Nuggets' buzzer-beating 3-pointer closing out the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Lakers' third-quarter flagrant foul.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Nuggets' steal and 3-pointer at the buzzer ending the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   It was the half-hearted practice in L.A. on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Probably, it was all of that. And a lack of hustle and in-game
adjustments, too.
</P>
<P>
   And it all added up to the Lakers' third loss of the season _
but first in a game that Shaquille O'Neal started and finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just that bad,'' O'Neal said after a 36-point,
eight-rebound, six-assist performance and a 2-for-14 night at the
free-throw line. ``They came out ready to play. We had them there
by (nine points in the second quarter), and we had a chance to put
them away, but we missed a couple of easy shots. They just played
harder than we did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an awful practice yesterday, and it probably just
carried over into today. Maybe it's just one of those days....
We're not going to make excuses up. They played harder, they were
quicker to the ball, they got to a lot more loose balls than we got
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Nuggets were quicker to the ball because they are, in
fact, just plain quicker than the Lakers. Antonio McDyess, Ron
Mercer, James Posey and Nick Van Exel led an athletic, speedy and
ferocious attack at both ends of the court. The slow-footed Lakers
just couldn't keep up.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal got in foul trouble guarding McDyess, who finished with
15 points and 13 rebounds. Posey, a rookie, scored 13 points, much
of it in transition, and disrupted everything Glen Rice tried to
do. Rice was frustrated into a 1-for-8 night from the field. Mercer
overwhelmed the Lakers' guards for 24 points and ex-teammate Van
Exel looked like the Nick the Quick of yore, scoring 23 against
Derek Fisher and John Celestand.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from 15 points from Fisher, the Lakers got little going
offensively while losing the rebounding margin 45-35.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came into the locker room at halftime and told these players
I thought we weren't hustling to win the ballgame,'' Lakers coach
Phil Jackson said. ``The loose balls, everything they got that was
laying on the floor, they got second opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers didn't do much with first chances either. Jackson was
particularly critical of Rice, blaming his poor shooting on an
unwillingness to move on offense without the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just doesn't seem to be able to play without the ball,''
Jackson said. ``They overplayed him and he couldn't get to the
basketball, even to catch it, and had it taken away from him when
he did catch it a couple times.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice disagreed. ``I don't see that,'' he said. ``You've got to _
in some cases when we go stretches where you realize I haven't been
involved, you've got to get me involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the momentum-turners. Mercer hit a 3-pointer to
close out the first half and cut the Lakers' lead to 42-39. He
opened the third with a 3-point play to tie the game. And minutes
later, when Posey was about to score on a fast-break layup, Rick
Fox hammered him to draw a flagrant foul. The Lakers were leading
51-48, but over the next 3:17, the Nuggets outscored them 14-2 to
take a nine-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me, every time there's a flagrant foul called, it
really turns the course of a ballgame,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The back-breaker came at the end of the third, the Lakers down
66-59. John Salley tossed a lazy inbounds pass from under the
Nuggets basket, and Posey intercepted near halfcourt, then hit a
buzzer-beating 3-pointer to make it a 10-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Jackson said, ``was just a little bit much for us to
overcome.''

BULLS IN NAME ONLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ A team wearing red Bulls uniforms will greet Los
Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson tonight at Staples Center, but it
will be understandable if he doesn't feel much sentimentality at
tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, the Bulls' coach for nine years, won't see many
familiar faces on the visiting bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few players, maybe three left,'' Jackson said.
``I don't even know if (Toni) Kukoc is with them.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not. He's injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or (Dicky) Simpkins.''
</P>
<P>
   Also missing, also injured. As is B.J. Armstrong. Among
Jackson's former players, that leaves only Randy Brown and Will
Perdue in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Will hasn't been part of it for four years,'' Jackson
noted. ``Yeah, it's really different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, there's a lot of people there, the whole organization
is coming. The P.R. guy, (Tim) Hallam, the radio and TV people.
Those are people you spend a lot of time with when you're the
coach, so there's a lot of that. The floor game, I think, will be
really clean. The other part will be different and nostalgic.''
</P>
<P>
   But more so when the Lakers travel to Chicago on Feb. 15. ``That
will be much more difficult,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he's more concerned with not letting the Bulls reverse
their trend of road woes _ Chicago has lost 16 of its last 17 games
away from United Center.
</P>
<P>
   In their second year under Tim Floyd, the Bulls are still
running the triangle offense installed by Jackson and current
Lakers assistant coach Tex Winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll know how to defend them somewhat,'' Jackson
said. ``But you never know, sometimes familiarity breeds that the
more you know about something, the less you know, or the less you
can defend it. So it should be real interesting in that respect....
Floyd's a good defensive coach, and I think he's going to make
trouble for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakers guard Ron Harper, who won three championships with
Jackson's Bulls, then spent last season playing for Floyd on a
losing team, said he sympathizes with their current struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real tough times there about now. I feel for them some,''
he said. ``It'll be fun (to play them). How can you feel bad
playing those guys. I mean, that's the place where I won my first
three rings, so I can't feel any ill feelings. It was a great place
for me to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's coming: Michael Jordan probably won't be on hand to
watch his old coach and his old team face off tonight, but he is
due in town the first week of December, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has heard Jordan plans to attend a game then, but he's
not sure if he'll join the Lakers for a workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've left an open invitation for him if he wants to,'' Jackson
said.

KINGS LOSE TO COYOTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's possible to play substandard hockey and still
beat the Chicago Blackhawks, but even the great teams can't
magically hit the switch when the elite clubs come to town.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix arrived in L.A. holding sixth place in the Western
Conference, but it represent much more. The Coyotes, in some
respect, are a litmus test for the Los Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings reveled in beating the Coyotes in Phoenix during the
weekend, and had a chance to increase their stature Thursday at
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Coyotes rallied for a 3-2 win on Keith Tkachuk's
goal 6:07 into the third period. It was the Kings' first loss in
five games and their second loss since Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk, who at the end of the first period took a silly
double-minor for roughing and gave the Kings a power play, atoned
for that mistake in the third period when he one-timed a shot from
the slot past Kings goalie Jamie Storr to put the Coyotes ahead
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   It was Tkachuk's sixth goal of the season, far off the pace
expected of him. Tkachuk, twice a 50-goal scorer, averaged 44.5
goals in each of the last four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   With their markedly improved power play from last season, the
Kings went on the power play shortly thereafter. And though they
had a few good chances, the Kings couldn't tie it. Phoenix goalie
Bob Essensa stopped Rob Blake on a shot from the right point and
also made a tough save on a deflection in front.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Galley, Ziggy Palffy and Len Barrie each had chances in
close but couldn't beat Essensa.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Kings' strengths this season is the power play, but
it was costly near the end of the first period. A turnover at
center ice led to Phoenix taking a 1-0 lead when Dallas Drake's
shot from the right wing glanced off Mike Sullivan and behind Storr
at the 17:40 mark. It was Sullivan's first of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Kings' power play came to a close, they were able to
get the equalizer. After some nifty work behind the net by Donald
Audette to hold onto the puck, Glen Murray made a cross-ice pass to
defenseman Aki Berg, cutting in from the right point. Berg gathered
the puck and fired a slapper off the far post and past Essensa to
make it 1-1 with 1:31 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   With Luc Robitaille and Jozef Stumpel out with injury, the Kings
need production from their other lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Audette-Murray-Smolinski contingent has provided that,
helping set up the first goal and combining for the one that put
the Kings ahead 2-1 early in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   After digging in the right wing corner, Murray slid a pass to
Audette in the right circle. Audette fired a shot over Essensa's
left shoulder at the 3:42 mark.
</P>
<P>
   The trio has combined for three goals and five assists since
Robitaille and Stumpel went out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a sensational 36-save effort in a one-goal win
against Chicago on Tuesday, Storr was again strong. He stopped
Travis Green, Phoenix's leading scorer, from point-blank range late
in the first period and kept Los Angeles in the lead momentarily
when he stopped Jeremy Roenick from the seat of his hockey pants.
Roenick was alone at the left side of the net and Storr was down,
but the shot fluttered and Storr was able to grab it.
</P>
<P>
   But less than a minute later, the Coyotes were able to knot it
2-2 when Trevor Letowski outmuscled Mattias Norstrom in front of
the net. Storr stopped J.J. Daigneault's shot from the left point
through traffic, but the rebound bounded into the slot. Despite
having Norstrom draped on him, Letowski flicked in the rebound at
the 11:24 mark.

UCLA FORCED TO RALLY IN EXHIBITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With its roster fortified and an old friend in
enemy colors, UCLA needed every healthy body to defeat the
California All-Stars 83-73 Thursday night in a ragged exhibition
game at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA overcame a stellar performance by former Bruin Charles
O'Bannon, who scored 20 points for the All-Stars in his first
appearance in Pauley since his final home game in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins trailed with three minutes left and needed a wild
3-point shot by point guard Earl Watson with 1:34 remaining to
preserve the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Earl was the one player on our team that stood
out,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``After that, it's hard to
see some positives. ... It was, basically, overall a poor
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson scored a team-high 19 points but did not finish the game.
During a scramble under the basket with 40 seconds left, he fell
backwards and slammed his tailbone on the court. His status for
Tuesday's season opener against Fairfield is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins welcomed back center Dan Gadzuric, who has tendonitis
in his knees, and guard Ryan Bailey, who has tendonitis in his
foot. Gadzuric had seven rebounds and nine points, mostly on dunks
and layups.
</P>
<P>
   Forward JaRon Rush, back from three days of personal business in
Kansas City, played 23 minutes and scored 10 points as a reserve.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's steadiest players were once again freshman forward Jason
Kapono (17 points) and sophomore forward Jerome Moiso (18).
</P>
<P>
   Guard Ray Young did not play because of a sprained ligament in
his right thumb.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a lot better,'' Lavin said. ``The doctors think there's
enough of the ligament remaining that it will heal on its own. He
may be able to play next week.''

KINGS' NEW POWER PLAY POTENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rob Blake remembers the power(less) play last
season. The one that converted about once every full moon. When he
looks at the Los Angeles Kings' power play this season, he doesn't
hesitate to remark as to why it's so successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a result of Ziggy Palffy coming in and taking
off a lot of pressure,'' said Blake, who's tied with Luc Robitaille
for the team lead with five power-play goals. ``When you've got a
guy like Ziggy and a healthy (Jozef) Stumpel, every time you're on
the ice there's a chance for the offense, and those guys will find
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings entered Thursday's game against Phoenix third in the
league in power-play efficiency, scoring 18 goals in 78 attempts
(23.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the Kings converted a paltry 13 percent of their power
plays last season, first-year coach Andy Murray made sure it was a
focal point in training camp. It was a daily hitting point, and
even though practices are shorter during the season, Murray makes
sure to touch on the power play each day, a rarity the past few
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Even Murray admits the philosophy is simple: find Blake's big
shot at the point and let him unload. But it also helps to have
Palffy's creativity and passing ability to loosen up defenses.
Palffy's fifth in the league with eight assists on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other teams are starting to take away (Blake), but the other
thing we have is the low threat,'' Murray said. ``It helps to have
Ziggy on the boards. We do have dimensions on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated Fiset: Injured Kings goalie Stephane Fiset continues
to work on his conditioning, but his ailing right hand isn't
getting any better. And Fiset is getting markedly frustrated by it,
saying he's having trouble each time he grips his stick. The pain
is so much he can't shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be five days, or it can be three weeks,'' Fiset said of
a possible return. ``The only think I can do is lots of drills with

   Khabibulin asks out: Phoenix goalie Nikolai Khabibulin, holding
out in a contract dispute, is apparently fed up with stalled
negotiations and has asked to be traded, according to reports in
Arizona. At first, Coyotes general manager Bobby Smith said he
wouldn't trade the 26-year-old goalie, but late word out is Smith
talked to the Florida Panthers about a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin, the career leader in wins for the Winnipeg/Phoenix
franchise with 126, hasn't played this season. He has a 2.13
goals-against average last season.

97-YEAR-OLD BOWLER SETS SIGHTS ON 100

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Flo Scorpio walks into a bowling alley the way
Frank Sinatra used to walk onto a stage or Babe Ruth onto a
baseball field.
</P>
<P>
   Like she owns the place.
</P>
<P>
   She picks up her bowling ball, shakes her arms a little to get
loose, lines up her shot, takes a three-step approach to the foul
line and lets the ball go.
</P>
<P>
   She stands there watching it roll slowly toward the pins,
curving in at the last moment to slip snugly into the one-three
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   All the pins go flying except one. The ten pin.
</P>
<P>
   If looks could kill, the ten pin would be dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should've been a strike,'' 97-year-old Flo Scorpio tells the
bowling gods.
</P>
<P>
   She settles for a spare.
</P>
<P>
   Behind her, the other members of the Sharpshooters women's
bowling team out of Bowlerland in the Van Nuys community of Los
Angeles' San Fernando Valley smile and shake their heads. It isn't
hard to read the look in their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   They all want to be standing where Flo Scorpio is standing now,
if and when they reach 97.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at Flo and think to myself: Heck, I've got another 25
years of bowling left,'' said Liz Rogers, president of the
4,000-member San Fernando Valley Women's Bowling Association.
``She's an inspiration to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Flo Scorpio of Van Nuys is the oldest woman league bowler in the
state. Rogers checked with the association's state office to
confirm it.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers watches Flo warm up by hitting the pocket dead on again,
daring the teetering ten pin not to fall this time. It finally
does.
</P>
<P>
   Flo smiles and sits down. It's going to be a good day, says the
matriarch of women bowlers in California.
</P>
<P>
   OK, let's get it out of the way right now _ this age thing.
</P>
<P>
   A 97-year-old woman isn't supposed to be carrying a 106 bowling
average in league play. If anything, she should be in a rocking
chair watching reruns of ``Bowling for Dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   But Flo Scorpio doesn't seem to play by the same rules the rest
of us follow. She prowls the lanes a couple of days a week when she
isn't at her dance and exercise classes.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about how old that birth certificate says you are, Flo
advises. Just keep moving. That's the key. Stop, and that nasty old
man carrying the scythe might get lucky and catch up to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took up bowling at 75 and had my best game at 80,'' she
said, taking a break and sneaking a look around to see if anyone
was listening.
</P>
<P>
   She's kind of embarrassed to mention her high score because it
was a fluke, she said. One of those days bowlers have maybe once or
twice in their lives when all the pins seem to fall no matter where
you throw the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a 225,'' Flo whispered. ``Never came close to it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Scorpio is her second husband's last name. She previously was
married almost 44 years to Bob Murchland, who worked for the
Studebaker car company before he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was widowed for six years before I married James Scorpio and
later took up bowling,'' she said. ``We were married almost 20
years before he died, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So now there are just Flo and her only child, Keith Murchland. A
great-grandfather himself, he drives his mother to the bowling
alley once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   Until about three weeks ago, just before her 97th birthday, Flo
drove herself most of the time, but she decided to give Father Time
a nod, if not a bow. She gave up her driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   Elayne Klein, one of the Sharpshooters, drove Flo to the alley
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the little-old-lady looks fool you, Klein said. Flo
has the heart of a lion. ``She's very competitive and minds very
much when she misses a spare.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein watched Flo throw a strike and walk back to the bench
smiling.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, it was an OK day on the lanes Thursday for the
state's oldest woman bowler. She bowled a 98.
</P>
<P>
   Below her average, but above her age. Right in line with her
goals.
</P>
<P>
   When she hits 100, Flo Scorpio says, she wants to bowl it.
</P>

<P>
   The stock-market joke about January is that it just keeps coming
earlier. This year it probably won't. It may even wait until
January.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger news is that when January does arrive it won't be
just small-company investors who are toasting their good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to unusually extensive end-of-the-year selling, worries
about rising interest rates, and concerns about Y2K glitches, the
stock market is likely to get an even bigger and broader seasonal
bounce than usual this year.
</P>
<P>
   Will you portfolio be ready?
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about the famed January effect, of course. Every
January _ well, to be precise, 60 out of the past 73 _
small-company stocks outperform large-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows exactly why, although most experts believe the
phenomenon has something to do with the tax-related selling of
losing stocks that begins in October and with the end-of-the-year
portfolio-dressing money managers employ as they get ready to
defend their stock picks to clients.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, betting on small-company stocks pays off
year in and year out. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 175) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, to take full advantage of the January effect,
investors have had to jump the gun. In fact, there hasn't been any
January effect at all in the past six Januarys.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1999, for example, the small-company Russell 2000
index climbed 1 percent while the large-company Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 Stock Index scored a 4 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not to say there wasn't a January effect last year.
It's just that the thing came early, as it generally has in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the Russell 2000 soared 6 percent, matching the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. In 1996, the Russell beat the S&AMP;P by five
percentage points, and in 1994, it beat the S&AMP;P by two. (Like 1998,
1997 and 1995 were ties.)
</P>
<P>
   That kind of outperformance in December is especially impressive
when you consider that over the past 50 years December has been the
Standard &AMP; Poor's best month, with an average gain of 1.8 percent. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year, many Wall Street gurus are predicting a
bigger-than-usual January effect. Their logic is pretty compelling.
Most stocks have taken a beating in 1999 _ although the performance
of a relative handful of big winners has made the indexes look
deceptively healthy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, as of Sept. 20 about 62 percent of stocks on the
New York Stock Exchange were down for the calendar year. That's
2,561 losers versus just 1,498 winners for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, about 50 percent of stocks were down for the year
_ even though the Nasdaq Composite index was up by almost 31
percent.
</P>
<P>
   All those losers mean lots of end-of-the-year selling to lock in
losses for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers with big gains in Cisco Systems (up 47 percent
from Jan. 1 through Sept. 24), Sun Microsystems (up 111 percent),
or Red Hat (up 629 percent since it went public in August) will be
looking to sell Coca-Cola (down 23 percent in 1999), Philip Morris
(down 34 percent), or Just for Feet (down 91 percent).
</P>
<P>
   You might think those stocks are ready for a rebound, since
they're so cheap now _ and in normal circumstances that might be
the case. But they face more selling pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The selling will start as early as October _ since many mutual
funds operate on a fiscal year that ends on Oct. 31 _ and will
stretch into December as individual investors take a turn.
</P>
<P>
   End-of-the-year portfolio dressing will hurt many of this year's
downtrodden, too.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers don't want to have to defend a big position in
Family Golf Centers (down 89 percent for 1999 as of Sept. 24) or
uBid (down 78 percent) or Rite Aid (also down 78 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Better to dump those turkeys before the end of the year and hope
no one notices the way they dogged up the portfolio in August and
September.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about additional interest-rate increases from the
Federal Reserve Board and about the effects of Y2K are also likely
to weigh on the market in the last quarter of the year _ and keep
depressed stocks from bouncing back too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of another 25-basis-point (100 basis points
equal one percentage point) hike from Alan Greenspan and company is
a great excuse to stay on the sidelines. After all, if rates
ratchet up further from here, then many stocks that have dipped $10
or $20 a share aren't as cheap as they look.
</P>
<P>
   And Y2K? It's a complete wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Could a computer glitch at midnight on Dec. 31 shut down the
world banking system or flight-control computers at the world's
airports? How about a supply-chain failure at a major automaker or
a collapse in sales at a computer-software company?
</P>
<P>
   All possible _ if unlikely _ and more reason to sit on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery, when it comes, should be even more robust than
usual. The pressure on stocks from tax-selling and
portfolio-dressing will ease with the end of the fiscal and
calendar years.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve either will have raised interest rates or
will have held off for several months _ in either case, the worry
will diminish. Y2K will start to get less scary well before Jan. 1,
as companies announce that they're seeing little or no effect on
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, on Jan. 1, happen what may, the market will be able
to put all this behind it. And because in 1999, for the first time
in a number of years, many large-company stocks have been hammered
along with small-company stocks, the January effect should take in
a very broad swath of the market.
</P>
<P>
   All these factors make it likely that the January effect will be
a very profitable seasonal trend to ride at the end of 1999, but
they also make timing the effect a little more uncertain than
usual.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, the low in the market has come during
the first couple weeks of November.
</P>
<P>
   An investor who wanted to take full advantage of the
end-of-the-year gain sold into the fall rally (a dependable
phenomenon all decade) and then used that cash to build new
positions by mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   This year, thanks to Y2K, the effect may play out a few weeks
later than that _ some investors will wait to see how the world's
computers seem to be reacting.
</P>
<P>
   But the basic strategy remains the same _ sell into the fall
rally (weak as it has been this year) and then redeploy cash in
November.
</P>
<P>
   And then trust that history will repeat itself. &QL;

SCIOSCIA INTRODUCED AS NEW ANGELS MANAGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ On the day he was introduced as the Anaheim
Angels' new manager, Mike Scioscia couldn't escape his past. Not
that there's any reason to.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, who signed a three-year contract worth a total of
about $1 million, became the 16th manager in Angels history
Thursday. But he spent much of his time during an afternoon news
conference at Edison Field fielding questions about his time in the
Dodgers organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face facts,'' said Scioscia, 40. ``My foundation is with
the Dodgers organization. I can't hide that. That's where I've been
since I was 17. I worked with people like John Roseboro, Del
Crandall, Walter Alston, Roy Campanella. They were an integral part
of my development as a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, who was drafted by the Dodgers in 1976 and played for
them from 1980-92, also learned from Tom Lasorda, his manager
during all of Scioscia's 13 seasons in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many times I was in Lasorda's office,''
said Scioscia, who lives in Thousand Oaks. ``He knew my priorities
and what I had to have to be successful. What I learned from that
is that as a manager you try to let the player know that you're
there for them and their best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels general manager Bill Stoneman made it clear from the
beginning that he was looking for someone who could manage people.
And in Scioscia, Stoneman believes he made the right choice,
picking the former catcher over six other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all of them would have been great choices,'' Stoneman
said. ``Mike fit the criteria better than the others.... I was
looking for somebody who knows what it's like to be a team player.
Somebody who works hard and has a presence with the players, the
fans and all of us in the organization. He's somebody who is a
winner and knows about winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia's predecessor, Terry Collins, managed the Dodgers'
Triple-A team in Albuquerque, as Scioscia did. But Collins lost
control of the Angels clubhouse and resigned Sept. 3. Stoneman,
though, said the clubhouse dissension of 1999 didn't weigh heavily
into his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stuff about the clubhouse, for me, was not as major an
issue as a lot of people expressed,'' he said. ``Those things
dissolve quickly. Winning dissolves it. For us now, the focus is on
winning and how to be a part of a winning team.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning is something Scioscia said he believes can happen right
away. Though club president Tony Tavares has implied the club is on
a three- to four-year plan, Scioscia doesn't believe the team has
to wait that long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this club is not far away,'' he said. ``I think the
club has a great, young nucleus and there is potential for a great
offensive ballclub here. It can go from last to the top two or
three offenses in the league if players stay healthy and they do
what they are capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, who caught more games for the Dodgers (1,395) than any
player in club history, also said the Angels' clubhouse problems
last season are a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened in the past,'' he said. ``It's not
my concern because I know where we're going. I'm going to pay a lot
of attention to chemistry.... I believe communication is very
important. It's extremely important for us to talk to our players,
and for me to talk to Bill upstairs. If you have communication with
people, you have respect and trust and you alleviate problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said he has not decided on a coaching staff, and that
he'll get input from Stoneman and the scouting department before
making his decisions. Two coaches from last season's team who have
the best chance of returning are hitting coach Rod Carew and bench
coach Joe Maddon, who was also interviewed for the managerial job.
</P>
<P>
   After his playing career ended in 1994, Scioscia was the
Dodgers' minor-league catching coordinator in 1995-96, and was the
bench coach with the major-league team in 1997-98 before managing
Albuquerque last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I've worked for all my life,'' Scioscia said.
``You never know when opportunities are going to present
themselves. For some people it takes 20 years. I'm happy I have
this opportunity at a young age.''

 By DAVE CALIFANO  
 c.1999 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, investment returns had two components: capital
gains and income. But after years of declining interest rates and
rocketing stock prices, the idea of investing to capture a stream
of interest and dividend payments seems frightfully old hat.
</P>
<P>
   Except, that is, for investors whose goals have changed from
accumulating wealth to spending it. We should all live so long.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who rely on their portfolios to spin off enough cash
to pay the bills soon discover how much has changed since the days
when electric utilities paid fat dividends and even Uncle Sam had
to pay double-digit interest rates to borrow money in the bond
market.
</P>
<P>
   Today, utilities retain their cash to compete in a newly
deregulated environment, and the U.S. Treasury, with a lighter
financing burden, pays about 6.08 percent for 30-year money.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that hasn't changed is the high cost of assembling a
diversified income-producing portfolio out of individual debt and
equity securities.
</P>
<P>
   Many bonds are issued in minimum denominations of $25,000 or
even $1 million, so mutual funds are the income investment of
choice for most people. But which funds?
</P>
<P>
   The income-fund universe has shrunk drastically in recent years,
but the database of Morningstar, the Chicago mutual-fund research
house, still lists more than 1,000 intermediate- to long-term bond
funds and about 200 funds composed primarily of income-producing
equity securities such as preferred stock and real-estate
investment trusts, or REITs.
</P>
<P>
   To help with the selection process, WORTH sought out funds that
consistently delivered above-average returns at reasonable risk. Of
course, risk tolerance varies from one investor to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors can tolerate wide swings in the value of their
principal as long as the income keeps flowing, while others give up
some yield for the assurance of stable principal.
</P>
<P>
   We found high-quality debt and equity funds at both extremes of
the risk/return spectrum, as well as those that fall somewhere in
between.
</P>
<P>
   For the absolutely risk-averse, there is the money-market mutual
fund. Investing in the very shortest term borrowings of governments
and corporations, these funds usually yield much less than
longer-term bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the highest-yielding generally available money-market
fund is Strong Investors Money Fund (800-359-3379), managed by Jay
Meuller. It yielded 5.29 percent as of Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
   To top the money-fund rankings, as it does regularly, Strong
charges a loss-leader 0.05 percent management fee. The firm can
raise the fee at any time, though it says it would do so only
gradually.
</P>
<P>
   Further out on both the risk and reward axes are
government-securities funds, which invest primarily or exclusively
in one- to ten-year securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and
various federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   These securities carry little or no credit risk, but fluctuate
in price.
</P>
<P>
   To get a sense of how volatile a fund might be, look at its
average duration. Although expressed in years, duration actually
measures how much the price of an investment must vary to produce a
one-percentage-point change in yield (remember, bond prices and
yields move in opposite directions).
</P>
<P>
   For example, a bond fund with a duration of five years must vary
in price by 5 percent for its yield to move up or down by one
percentage point. Generally speaking, the longer the duration, the
more volatile the security.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton Vance Government Obligations Fund (800-225-6265) charges a
4.75 percent load for its A shares but throws off a high yield _

3.84 years, far less than lower-yielding funds that invest in
longer-term Treasury bonds.

   Investors who can stomach more volatility should consider

</P>
<P>
   With a payout of 10.72 percent as of Sept. 7, Scudder High Yield
Bond Fund (800-225-2470) is near the top of its category, and its

<P>
   Investors should expect some fluctuation in the value of their
principal. The fund's standard deviation _ that is, its widest
likely variance from its average price _ is 7.66, compared with

<P>
   Two funds that rely on equity for their income merit a mention.
Flaherty &AMP; Crumrine's Preferred Income Fund (626-795-7300), managed
by Peter Stimes, Robert Ettinger, Donald Crumrine, and Robert
Flaherty, invests in preferred stock _ shares whose dividend must
be paid before the issuer can pay a dividend on its common stock.
</P>
<P>
   Preferred-share prices, like all share prices, will vary, but
they tend to follow the movements of bonds, not stocks. As of Sept.
7, Preferred Income yielded 7.65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For good old-fashioned plump dividends, REITs are the investment
of choice.
</P>
<P>

properties ranging from apartment buildings to office complexes to
prisons, must pay out 95 percent of their income as dividends.

managed by Martin Cohen, yielded 8.2 percent as of Sept. 7.

real-estate market. Last year was a bad year for real estate and
REITs, whose composite price fell 24 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, investment returns had two components: capital
gains and income. But after years of declining interest rates and
rocketing stock prices, the idea of investing to capture a stream
of interest and dividend payments seems frightfully old hat.
</P>
<P>
   Except, that is, for investors whose goals have changed from
accumulating wealth to spending it. We should all live so long.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who rely on their portfolios to spin off enough cash
to pay the bills soon discover how much has changed since the days
when electric utilities paid fat dividends and even Uncle Sam had
to pay double-digit interest rates to borrow money in the bond
market.
</P>
<P>
   Today, utilities retain their cash to compete in a newly
deregulated environment, and the U.S. Treasury, with a lighter
financing burden, pays about 6.08 percent for 30-year money.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that hasn't changed is the high cost of assembling a
diversified income-producing portfolio out of individual debt and
equity securities.
</P>
<P>
   Many bonds are issued in minimum denominations of $25,000 or
even $1 million, so mutual funds are the income investment of
choice for most people. But which funds?
</P>
<P>
   The income-fund universe has shrunk drastically in recent years,
but the database of Morningstar, the Chicago mutual-fund research
house, still lists more than 1,000 intermediate- to long-term bond
funds and about 200 funds composed primarily of income-producing
equity securities such as preferred stock and real-estate
investment trusts, or REITs.
</P>
<P>
   To help with the selection process, WORTH sought out funds that
consistently delivered above-average returns at reasonable risk. Of
course, risk tolerance varies from one investor to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors can tolerate wide swings in the value of their
principal as long as the income keeps flowing, while others give up
some yield for the assurance of stable principal.
</P>
<P>
   We found high-quality debt and equity funds at both extremes of
the risk/return spectrum, as well as those that fall somewhere in
between.
</P>
<P>
   For the absolutely risk-averse, there is the money-market mutual
fund. Investing in the very shortest term borrowings of governments
and corporations, these funds usually yield much less than
longer-term bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the highest-yielding generally available money-market
fund is Strong Investors Money Fund (800-359-3379), managed by Jay
Meuller. It yielded 5.29 percent as of Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
   To top the money-fund rankings, as it does regularly, Strong
charges a loss-leader 0.05 percent management fee. The firm can
raise the fee at any time, though it says it would do so only
gradually.
</P>
<P>
   Further out on both the risk and reward axes are
government-securities funds, which invest primarily or exclusively
in one- to ten-year securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and
various federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   These securities carry little or no credit risk, but fluctuate
in price.
</P>
<P>
   To get a sense of how volatile a fund might be, look at its
average duration. Although expressed in years, duration actually
measures how much the price of an investment must vary to produce a
one-percentage-point change in yield (remember, bond prices and
yields move in opposite directions).
</P>
<P>
   For example, a bond fund with a duration of five years must vary
in price by 5 percent for its yield to move up or down by one
percentage point. Generally speaking, the longer the duration, the
more volatile the security.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton Vance Government Obligations Fund (800-225-6265) charges a
4.75 percent load for its A shares but throws off a high yield _
7.36 percent as of Sept. 7 _ while keeping its duration to a slim
3.84 years, far less than lower-yielding funds that invest in
longer-term Treasury bonds.

CORNERBACK SIMMONS OUT FOR UCLA GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC cornerback Antuan Simmons underwent back
surgery Thursday and will not play against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons had surgery at USC University Hospital to relieve
pressure on a nerve in his spinal column. He is scheduled to be
released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors were positive,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``It
will be tough for him to sit in the hospital and watch the UCLA
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons will be replaced by freshman Darrell Rideaux, who will
make his first career start. Another true freshman, Kevin Arbet,
replaces Rideaux as the nickelback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think UCLA's going to come at us quite often,'' Rideaux
said. ``How we respond to the adversity will be the key. I do feel
like I've been groomed and I'm ready to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rideaux, who is 5-foot-8, said he won't be intimidated when he
has to defend UCLA standout Danny Farmer, who is 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like David vs. Goliath, that's the attitude that I
take,'' Rideaux said. ``It's nothing new. I have a lot of respect
for Danny Farmer but I am a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Hackett: ``We'll just stack them up on top of each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward will play: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward said that he will
play against UCLA, and that his strained left hamstring would be
OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool,'' Soward said. ``I'm ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward said he feels much better than he did entering the Cal
game, when he was forced to sit because of the same injury.
</P>
<P>
   No defense? Hackett shrugged off the impression that UCLA's
defense has not been very good this season, despite ranking 10th in
rush defense in the Pacific-10 Conference and ninth in total
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, they didn't have a very good defense and kicked
our butt,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   No managers game: The annual game between the USC and UCLA
managers will apparently not take place. USC's managers placed
three phone calls to UCLA regarding the game, but none were
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts possible: Offensive lineman Trevor Roberts (broken
wrist) has been fitted with a cast and is listed as possible.
</P>
<P>
   No deja vu: USC quarterback John Fox said he isn't thinking back
to 1997, the last time he started against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a great deal in terms of bragging rights, but as far
as two years ago, I haven't even envisioned that.''
</P>
<P>
   Big recruiting weekend?: Hackett was asked whether the outcome
of the USC-UCLA game has much effect on recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, all the good players in Southern California
will be at the game,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. Tight end Alex Holmes of Harvard-Westlake, who is
considering both schools, will visit Michigan this weekend. Another
player considering both schools, safety Matt Grootegoed of Mater
Dei, said he will attend the game.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni support: Hackett promised every senior from last year's
team a sideline pass for Saturday's game, and said about 12 to 15
have responded.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be a walkway formed by ex-players for the team
to enter the field before the game.

<TEXT>
<P>
   While the U.S. economy has been booming, averaging growth of a
little over 3 percent annually since 1991, our friends in the
United Kingdom have been doing nearly as well: Their economy has
grown an average of 2.8 percent a year since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Incomes and home values have risen, unemployment is low (4.2
percent), and inflation is weak (1.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by the Confederation of British Industry found
that optimism among manufacturers is at a two-year high. By the
start of autumn, the pound sterling had climbed 7 percent against
major currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Even British culture is hot again: Reservations for good London
restaurants are now hard to get (they were hard to get five years
ago, too, but that's because there weren't any good restaurants).
</P>
<P>
   Tourism in ``Cool Britannia'' is up. And Prince William _ ``His
Royal Hunk'' on Web sites _ is suddenly a teen heartthrob.
</P>
<P>
   So why does Prime Minister Tony Blair want to fix what ain't
broken and ditch the pound for the floundering euro? Certainly not
for the sake of political expediency.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by the Federation of Small Businesses,
nearly 60 percent of small British firms oppose monetary union. To
them it sounds like taxation without representation (I can just see
it: Londoners staging their own Boston Tea Party by pouring French
wine into the Thames).
</P>
<P>
   At a private dinner with former prime minister Margaret
Thatcher, I was struck by her ruthless comments: ``We British and
you Americans believe in equity and fairness _ traits not shared in
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   She then reminded us, ``We saved Europe, defeated half _ with
America _ and rescued the other half. We won't get absorbed into
Europe now.''
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher may be more of a national monument than a viable
political power these days, but her views reflect more than the
Tory right wing.
</P>
<P>
   British newspapers routinely report the latest efforts from
Brussels to ``harmonize'' regulations and create industry standards
for almost every product. Many such edicts lend themselves to
mockery, including an alleged ban on curved bananas, restrictions
on transporting scotch whisky, and design requirements for coffins.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most publicized ``standardization'' has involved
establishing uniform characteristics for the ``euro-condom.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair is drawn toward the continent for two main reasons.
Philosophically, he believes in a ``greater'' Europe. In this view,
the U.K. is more vulnerable in isolation than as part of European
Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.K. currently enjoys robust growth and low inflation,
those good times might not last; capital could flee across the
English Channel.
</P>
<P>
   In a practical sense, Blair knows that large British businesses
like British Airways tend to support monetary union. Big
multinationals like General Motors and Toyota have made it known
they could be forced to cut back on their U.K.-based investments if
the U.K. stays outside EMU.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his personal popularity and the near collapse of the
opposition Conservative Party, Blair faces an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   Whether big business gets its way and triumphs over the little
firm will depend on how well EMU works for the continent. Blair has
pledged to hold a referendum before committing to the euro, and
that's not likely to happen before he could be reelected, probably
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Tory government shrewdly negotiated the possibility
of joining EMU after its 1999 launch, the U.K. can now stand back
and watch EMU sink or swim.
</P>
<P>
   If the latter, Blair and his followers can start preparing to
cross the chilly waters of the English Channel by donning their
euro-standardized swimsuits. But don't bet on it. &QL;

   In a practical sense, Blair knows that large British businesses
like British Airways tend to support monetary union. Big
multinationals like General Motors and Toyota have made it known
they could be forced to cut back on their U.K.-based investments if
the U.K. stays outside EMU.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his personal popularity and the near collapse of the
opposition Conservative Party, Blair faces an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   Whether big business gets its way and triumphs over the little
firm will depend on how well EMU works for the continent. Blair has
pledged to hold a referendum before committing to the euro, and
that's not likely to happen before he could be reelected, probably
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Tory government shrewdly negotiated the possibility
of joining EMU after its 1999 launch, the U.K. can now stand back
and watch EMU sink or swim.
</P>
<P>
   If the latter, Blair and his followers can start preparing to
cross the chilly waters of the English Channel by donning their
euro-standardized swimsuits. But don't bet on it. &QL;

ANGELS PICKED WRONG MAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The ideal successor for Terry Collins was right
under the Anaheim Angels' noses. We're not talking about Westlake
Village's Mike Scioscia, whose career was still married to the
Dodgers on the September day Collins stood in a dreary room at
Edison Field and bid a teary farewell to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   A suitable replacement just happened to be in the building that
night, in the visiting clubhouse prepping the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees hitting coach Chris Chambliss is going to make some team
a fine manager one day. The pity is it won't be the Angels, who
given the chance to make an inspired hire, opted for cheap
(literally, given the terms of Scioscia's three-year contract)
sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   To baseball devotees in Southern California, Scioscia is as
lovable as Bambi. How could you not root for the man who used
modest tools and an oversized heart to build a solid 15-year
major-league career as a catcher?
</P>
<P>
   In late September, when the Fox bosses at Chavez Ravine let
Scioscia know he no longer fit into the Dodgers' long-range plans,
they came across looking as heartless as the hunters who killed
Bambi's mother.
</P>
<P>
   It figures Disney was behind both the 1942 movie classic and
Wednesday's move to marry a jilted Dodgers son to an Angels
organization that long has been perceived as the ugly stepsister in
Southern California's baseball family.
</P>
<P>
   Say this for Michael Eisner and Co.: When it comes to tugging at
the public's heartstrings (and wallets), nobody does it better.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, 40, brings a considerable dowry to the union, namely
the hearts of fans won during the years he spent as a loyal soldier
for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss, for all his credentials, couldn't have turned Dodger
blue into Angels periwinkle by his mere presence.
</P>
<P>
   His 17 years of playing experience in both the National and
American Leagues, his three minor-league managerial stints and two
minor-league manager of the year awards, two World Series rings as
a player and his three World Series rings as a member of Joe
Torre's Yankees staff won Chambliss an audience with Angels general
manager Bill Stoneman but nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia's one year of minor-league managerial experience
obviously mattered less than his 23 years of living !ital!la
vida &UR; !off! &LR;  local.
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss, 50, who is African-American, can claim to be a victim
of prejudice all right, the Angels showing a definite bias toward
the guy with the West Coast ties over the guy from the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it was simply the Angels, who are reportedly available
for the right price, were told that in order to make their books
look better to potential buyers, they couldn't spring for the
moving expenses of anybody east of Ojai.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last November when they unloaded $80 million to sign free
agent Mo Vaughn, the Angels don't seem in any hurry to part with
copious amounts of cash. It's true, they offered Don Baylor a
handsome four-year, $4.9 million contract last month to manage the
team. But they didn't make their move until after Baylor had gotten
deeply involved with the Cubs. The Angels' courting of him was akin
to pledging your undying love to a woman while passing through the
receiving line at her wedding to somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   They've been similarly wishy-washy in their dealings with
free-agent pitcher Chuck Finley, who has the same lovey-dovey
relationship with Angels fans that Scioscia had with Dodgers fans
in his playing days.
</P>
<P>
   Six teams are reported to be vying for the left-hander's
services. Given the market for southpaws, there's certain to be a
club that finds his $9 million a year asking price a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't expect it to be the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Memo to Mark Petkovsek: Better get ready for your close-up.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, the Angels right now have a stronger rotation in
the outfield than on the mound. That doesn't bode well for the 2000
season no matter who is managing.
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss deserved a chance in Anaheim but it's probably better
for him that he didn't get it. There are worse things than working
with the best team in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Scioscia. We wish him the best of luck.
He's going to need it.

<P>
   Witching hour approaches. Goblins and gremlins and ghouls will
set mischief loose in the world. Fear will add its chill to the
winds that sweep through the streets. With every sunset, solid
citizens know they're another day closer to... Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have a right to feel nervous. When it's time to roll
over to the double zeros of 2000, some computers won't make the
transition. Undiscovered software bugs will leave the poor machines
stuck in 1900 or hopelessly dithering over the date.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst-case scenario, automatic teller machines could
refuse to spit out cash, electrical utility grids could fail, and
entire industries could come to a halt when their computerized
inventory-control and manufacturing systems stop answering
commands.
</P>
<P>
   The chance that anything so cataclysmic might happen is small,
but real. The truth is that nobody knows for sure what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market hates uncertainty _ its inability to predict
whether or not the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates
a piddling 25 basis points is enough to send the indexes tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine the intensity of investor reaction to a genuinely
chilling possibility, no matter how remote.
</P>
<P>
   A stock such as Lucent Technologies fell 9 percent on July 20,
when Wall Street analysts decided that a passing remark by a
company executive about a possible slowdown in sales during the
quarter ending in December was a sign that the curse of Y2K had hit
the company.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately it will pay more this winter to be attentive and
thoughtful than to be frightened, because Y2K will mean both tricks
and treats.
</P>
<P>
   For every company that shows lower sales and earnings, others
will report unexpectedly strong results.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investors may decide to head for the sidelines, pulling
money out of financial markets in favor of the security of cash.
But foreign investors, especially those with money in emerging
markets, are likely to flee to the comparative safety of the U.S.
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the tricks the Y2K bug may play on investors means
paying attention to only part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the auto industry. The big U.S.-based automakers
such as Ford and General Motors are exactly the kinds of companies
most susceptible to the bite of the year-2000 bug.
</P>
<P>
   They sit at the top of immensely long supply chains: Their
assembly lines require interior assemblies from Lear and body
frames from Tower Automotive, for example. Those suppliers rely on
even smaller suppliers for everything from screws to vinyl.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these parts are delivered by computerized just-in-time
inventory systems that try to keep parts on hand to a minimum. Any
disruption to that flow, and the computerized manufacturing systems
that churn out cars will grind to a halt for days or weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, auto executives know this _ and know that no matter
how rigorously they've tested their own internal systems the
carmakers are at the mercy of systems failures anywhere in the
supply chain.
</P>
<P>
   So what have these companies been doing? Well, they have asked
suppliers to ensure that their own systems are bug-free _ and
they've temporarily turned their just-in-time inventory systems
into just-in-case insurance policies by stockpiling larger than
normal supplies of critical components. Momentary glitches won't
shut this industry down.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see the same thing in industry after industry, with the
same essential effect: The numbers in company reports will be
confusing, and stock prices will be unusually volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that increase inventories are adding costs and
temporarily depressing earnings. It will take quick footwork to
convince Wall Street analysts that measures intended to prevent
truly serious problems aren't reasons to lower long-term
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors won't get the message, of course, and they'll
liquidate long-term positions on essentially meaningless changes in
quarterly numbers.
</P>
<P>
   While some companies are recording higher costs as a result of
building inventory, others in the same industry will be showing
unexpectedly strong sales as customers step up orders so they, too,
can stockpile critical components.
</P>
<P>
   Investors shouldn't get too excited by that good news, either.
Those increased sales in the current quarter will lead to reduced
sales in future quarters when customers cut back on purchases in
order to work down inventory to normal, just-in-time levels.
</P>
<P>
   Smoothing out the trend to get a picture of what's really going
on will require intensive research and number crunching by analysts
and investors.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors will opt to sell instead of putting in the work
to figure out what the numbers mean _ after all, the conventional
wisdom is that the approach of the millennium will send share
prices down as worried individuals move to good old low-tech cash.
</P>
<P>
   But even here, the potential treats will temper the effect of
the potential tricks. Safety is a relative term, after all, and
from the perspective of individuals who have most of their money in
the stock markets of Brazil, Mexico, and Taiwan, the U.S. financial
markets look positively Y2K-bug proof.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. banks, as well as European-based global banks, are
likely to see an inflow of cash from wealthy foreigners who think
having a bit of cash in New York or Miami is just a prudent hedge
against systems failure back home. Foreign corporations are likely
to make similar moves.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that the approach of the millennium will move
numbers _ at individual companies and in entire financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The short-term changes in the figures, for better or worse, will
be big enough that analysts and investors will have a hard time
ignoring them. The market can be counted on to make too much of the
short-term trend: Research shows that the market tends to project
short-term change further into the future than the facts warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary volatility in earnings or global cash flows will seem
more important than they are because of this tendency.
</P>
<P>
   The market will eventually get it right and correct those
errors. But that adjustment will take time, and while the market
works its way through this volatility, there will be more than
enough moments that seem truly horrifying.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who allow the momentary fright to scare them out of
long-term holdings are likely to regret it.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who can shrug off the scare and buy individual
equities when some loud ``boo'' has sent other investors running
for cover are likely to find their bags full of treats long after
the goblins have been put to bed. &QL;

LAUSD MIGHT MISS FUNDING DEADLINE, LOSE MILLIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Greg Gittrich  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A year after missing a crucial deadline for
federal money to hook classrooms to the Internet, Los Angeles
Unified School District officials admit they fouled up again this
year and risk losing $180 &UR;  &LR; million in funding.
</P>
<P>
   At a Proposition BB bond oversight committee meeting Thursday,
technology division officials said the nation's second-largest
school district simply has not hired enough employees to meet the
December deadline despite seven months of work.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the Los Angeles Unified School District has failed to
budget money for the 18 &UR;  &LR; percent match needed to win the federal
grant to wire 170 schools for the Internet, said Jim Konantz,
district director of instructional technology. LAUSD missed out on
$60 &UR;  &LR; million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Board of Education President Genethia Hayes was outraged to
learn of the foul-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who did the staff share these concerns with? Did anyone share
this?'' Hayes asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find this extraordinary, especially if the same problems
happened in the past. It is unconscionable to even begin to think
the district would be operating like this. Checks and balances
should have caught this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes said the bureaucratic bungling reinforces the board's
recent decision to force Superintendent Ruben Zacarias into an
early retirement and hire Ramon C. Cortines to lead the district on
an interim basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would our staff not be able to handle this?'' she asked.
``And if the deadline is in December, why in God's name wouldn't we
have time to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Proposition BB meeting, Steve Soboroff, chairman of the
bond oversight committee, repeatedly asked the district's
technology supervisors to explain what they need to meet the
December deadline for the federal E-Rate program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to take any chances. We want this to work. What
do you need from us? What do you need from the Board of
Education?'' Soboroff asked, only to pose the question over and
over again before getting an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Konantz finally replied, ``We need office staff.''
</P>
<P>
   School board members David Tokofsky and Julie Korenstein urged
Konantz to submit a budget request for emergency staff to the
school board by today so it could be considered at Tuesday's board
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Technology supervisors estimated the cost for the extra help
would be about $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``So $200,000 for $180 &UR;  &LR; million,'' Korenstein said, clearly
exasperated that the board wasn't asked to approve the item
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In order to meet the federal application requirements, the
Proposition BB oversight committee unanimously approved a motion to
put up money from the $2.4 &UR;  &LR; billion Proposition BB bond measure to
ensure the district has matching funds needed to receive the E-Rate
funds.
</P>
<P>
   While facilities personnel attempted repeatedly to reassure the
oversight committee that the application deadline would be met,
LAUSD technology officer George Beckwith described himself as the
``only full-time person doing E-Rate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we put together this package, and it didn't get
through the bureaucracy,'' Beckwith warned, before expressing
optimism that the recent appointment of Chief Operating Officer
Howard Miller would help the district meet the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Only one-third of the district's campuses have applied for
E-Rate funding during the first two years of the program, and there
is no clear plan in place to improve the application process in
order to ensure more schools obtain money to wire classrooms for
computers, Tokofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the E-Rate program will draw from a pool of
$2.3 &UR;  &LR; billion set aside by Congress to wire public schools and
libraries. Schools awarded funding will receive money to install
Internet connections for five computers in each classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with cost overruns related to wiring campuses, the LAUSD
Facilities Division recently canceled or scaled back hundreds of
safety and technology improvements that it promised to complete at
schools during the next year with bond money.
</P>
<P>
   The Proposition BB's safety and technology work is running about
$200 &UR;  &LR; million over budget, nearly the same amount of money the
district is entitled to through the E-Rate program, Soboroff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would wipe out the entire cost overrun for the
Proposition BB projects,'' he said.

KINGS FALL TO COYOTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Kings worked on the power play in
training camp. They do it in nearly every practice as well, which
is a big reason they were third in the league in power-play
percentage.
</P>
<P>
   But there are times like Thursday when none of that matters,
when the power play falters and the outcome is a result of failures
with the man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Tkachuk's goal 6:07 into the third period gave the Phoenix
a come-from-behind 3-2 win against the Kings at Staples Center, but
it was Los Angeles' inability to solve the Coyotes penalty-killing
unit that was the ultimate undoing.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, who were converting on 23 percent of their power
plays, were 0 for 7 against Phoenix. What's worse was the
short-handed goal the Kings allowed late in the first period, a
dubious blow to begin what certainly was a debacle of a power-play
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were minus-1 (on the power play), which is
unsatisfactory,'' Kings coach Andy Murray said. ``We were
disappointed with our power play. Usually, your power play is a
reflection of how hard you work, but tonight it wasn't. Usually,
it's a reward for the hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, some of the Kings' struggles have to be connected with
the loss of Luc Robitaille. He and Rob Blake lead the Kings with
five power-play goals apiece. But with Robitaille limping around
the press box, even with Ziggy Palffy setting up along the boards,
more teams are focusing on stopping Blake from ripping shots from
the point. The Kings power play has gone scoreless in its past two
games _ 0 for 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you can start with our penalty-killing unit,''
Phoenix coach Bob Francis said as a reason for the win. ``Their
power play is their focal point. They have Palffy on the half wall
and Blake up top with the one-timer you have to eliminate. It's a
tough combination to eliminate, but our guys found a way.''
</P>
<P>
   It reached the point where the Kings coaching staff went to
video of the power play, and Phoenix's kill strategy, during the
second intermission.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had chances on both of their power-play sequences in
the third period, but they weren't able to beat Phoenix goalie Bob
Essensa for the equalizer either time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the difference, I thought it was the power play,''
said winger Donald Audette, who assisted on the Kings' first goal
and scored the second one. ``We had some great chances. When you
have chances like (Bryan) Smolinski had from the slot, then you're
getting good chances. They just stopped them.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Kings' first loss in five games and their second loss
since Oct. 22. Los Angeles (12-5-4) also fell into second place in
the Pacific Division, a point behind San Jose and three points
ahead of the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk, who at the end of the first period took a silly
double-minor for roughing and gave the Kings a power play, gave the
Coyotes the lead when he one-timed a shot from the slot past Kings
goalie Jamie Storr to put the Coyotes ahead 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   It was Tkachuk's sixth goal of the season, far off the pace
expected of him. Tkachuk, twice a 50-goal scorer, averaged 44.5
goals in each of the last four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later the Kings went on the power play, but Essensa (29
saves) made a right-toe save on a Blake drive from the point and
also made a tough save on a deflection.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Galley, Palffy and Len Barrie each had chances in close
but couldn't beat Essensa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, we had chances in the third period,'' Murray said. ``I
thought we had a lot of quality scoring chances, so we forced some
turnovers.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The business improvement district revolution has
created regions within Los Angeles communities that supporters say
have created growing economies along safer and cleaner streets.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate their achievements _ and to help others create BIDs
in their own neighborhoods _ hundreds of people gathered at the
first-ever BID conference at California State University,
Northridge, about 25 miles north of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vitality of our commercial districts is integral with our
success as a city,'' said Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Feuer,
whose city council district includes business districts in in the
Los Angeles communities of Westwood, Studio City and Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small business and larger businesses work together in business
improvement districts and can enact improvements from upgrades in
public safety to esthetic improvements on the street to marketing
of the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1994, the number of BIDs in Los Angeles County has
grown from one, five years ago, to 25 in 1999. Karen Kalfayan of
the Los Angeles City Clerk's Office said 24 additional BIDs are in
the various stages of development citywide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The San Fernando Valley is experiencing a revolution in
business district revival,'' said Ken Bernstein, chairman of the
Economic Alliance's Business Improvement District Council, which
sponsored the conference. The San Fernando Valley part of Los
Angeles stretches north of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The districts, where local property owners assess themselves a
fee on an annual basis to help finance cosmetic improvements or
other services, are designed to enhance awareness _ and eventually
business _ of a particular area.
</P>
<P>
   The districts create a real sense of place, Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Joe Vogt with a BID in the Canoga Park area of the Valley:
``As we improve the district, it will have an effect on the
surrounding community. People will clean up their homes and
neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   The district, for example, has created the ``Adopt a Street
Light Program,'' where local business owners pay $45 a year, which
is then used to paint all the light poles on a major street in the
district, said Vogt.
</P>
<P>
   ``As property owners and business owners, we are in the driver's
seat to make things happen,'' he said.

SMOLINSKI IS KEY TO DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: New lead) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On most nights, Ziggy Palffy makes the power play
go. He creates offense, pushes defenses onto their heels and opens
ice for the rest of the Los Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
   All this was known, as is the fact the Kings gave the New York
Islanders good young talent and a draft pick to get him.
</P>
<P>
   But the feeling among the Kings is the key to the deal was
center Bryan Smolinski. He had the talent to score 31 goals one
season in Boston, yet had 29 goals in his last two seasons on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the trade would be evaluated, at least on our side,
on how Bryan played,'' Kings coach Andy Murray said Thursday before
a 3-2 loss to Phoenix at Staples Center. ``He makes the trade, to
this point, look pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Smolinksi's assist on Donald Audette's second-period goal was
his 17th point this season, and he's been strong on face-offs,
winning more than half of them.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a long way from where Smolinski found himself during
training camp. The Kings were closing the Forum with an exhibition
game, but Smolinksi was a coach's decision scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he really wanted to play in that game,'' Murray said.
``He's come a long way since then. For me, Smolinksi, Audette and
(Glen) Murray each had something to prove coming into this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated Fiset: Injured Kings goalie Stephane Fiset continues
to work on his conditioning, but his ailing right hand isn't
getting any better. And Fiset is getting markedly frustrated by it,
having trouble any time he grips his stick. The pain is so great he
can't shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be five days or it can be three weeks,'' Fiset said of
a possible return. ``The only thing I can do is lots of drills with
my feet.''
</P>
<P>
   An MRI conducted earlier this week showed no break in the hand,
but it hasn't sped up the recovery. Fiset, who was wearing a
relatively new blocker (he had it for three weeks) when he was
injured in pregame warmups, said he's having a new blocker made for
when he returns.
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin asks out: Phoenix goalie Nikolai Khabibulin, holding
out in a contract dispute, is apparently fed up with stalled
negotiations and asked to be traded, according to reports in
Arizona. At first, Coyotes general manager Bobby Smith said he
wouldn't trade the 26-year-old goalie, but late word out is Smith
talked to the Florida Panthers about a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin, the career leader in wins for the Winnipeg/Phoenix
franchise with 126, hasn't played this season. He had a 2.13
goals-against average last season.

BRADLEY DRILLS GORE ON ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley
unleashed his sharpest words yet for Vice President Al Gore
Thursday as he lambasted the Clinton administration for renewing
undeveloped offshore oil leases in California.
<P>
   Bradley also charged that Gore's health care plan shows  &LR; is
evidence he ``hasn't seen the real world out there.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Chronicle during a campaign swing in
Los Angeles, the former U.S. senator from New Jersey attacked
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's announcement last Friday that 36
offshore leases will be extended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised and disappointed that the leases were put
out,'' said Bradley, in California for a campaign event on
education and two fund-raisers. ``I don't think (they) should have
been given.''
</P>
<P>
   He then jabbed at Gore, suggesting that the vice president
should have spoken up about an environmental issue so important in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me ... (it) indicates either that he didn't attempt to stop
the leases or that his clout failed to carry the day in the
administration,'' Bradley said, ``either one of which is
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   With the crucial March 7 California primary just 14 weeks away,
the former Knicks basketball star threw some sharp elbows at the
Democratic front-runner, who has been critical of Bradley in recent
weeks on issues like health care and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, also in California this week, announced a new parks
proposal and said Bradley's health care plan would leave Latinos,
African Americans and victims of AIDS at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley bridled at such statements. ``What (Gore is) doing, he's
going down constituency by constituency: `This is terrible. That is
terrible.' Attack, attack, attack, attack,'' he said. ``After
awhile, you'll find some people who will be offended by the fact
that he's using race or ethnicity to try to scare people. Scare
tactics are what you use when you're not confident of your own
positive vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's comments came as he appeared at an Echo Park public
school to stress his support for after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   The former senator tried to position himself as the political
fresh face compared with Gore's Beltway-insider image. ``It's
Washington politics; don't say what you're for ... say what you're
against,'' he said. ``It's a mistake, a big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign responded immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``There goes Senator Bradley again, acting like a typical
politician, launching negative attacks on Al Gore,'' Gore spokesman
Chris LeHane said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has been working on health care since Day
One in the administration, when Bradley was MIA,'' LeHane said.
``Senator Bradley has only found this issue as a candidate for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley argued that his health plan, which would do away with
Medicaid in favor of a voucher-like system through a network of
private providers, presents a direct contrast to Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who champions Medi- caid as the answer hasn't seen the
real world out there,'' Bradley said. ``Only about 30 to 34 percent
of the doctors will take a Medicaid patient. So what happens is ...
they go to the emergency (room) already sick, getting the most
expensive care and having all of us pay for it through property
taxes or increased premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``My approach would allow people to go to a doctor before they
get sick ... so it would also make them healthier in the long
run,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LeHane countered that Bradley's plan doesn't make financial
sense, leaving many people ``out in the cold.''
</P>
<P>
   On other topics, Bradley charged that the Gore campaign has
shown ``a real insensitivity'' by attacking a Bradley TV spot on
women's health care. The ad features a woman who credits Bradley
with saving her baby because he supported legislation to allow
women longer stays in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But an analysis of the ad by the Washington Post found it
``highly misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   While in the Senate, Bradley sponsored a 1996 law requiring
insurers to pay for 48-hour hospital stays for mothers and their
newborns. The Post said the woman and her first child developed
serious complications about 26 hours after the birth _ but this
happened in 1993, two years before Bradley proposed his bill.
What's more, the Post found, the woman's insurance company paid for
her to remain hospitalized for 48 hours, so the illnesses were
treated.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was unapologetic Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have absolutely no problem with the ad. ... I do not intend
to withdraw it,'' he said. ``I am appalled that people would attack
a woman who obviously lived through tremendous trauma, has her
views and expressed them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley _ wrestling with Gore for the environmental mantle
in California _ was particularly tough on the vice president on the
issue of California's offshore oil leases.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bradley have announced their opposition to future
offshore oil drilling in California. The state of California, on
behalf of the California Coastal Commission, sued the federal
government this week to block extensions on the 36 undeveloped
offshore oil leases that the Clinton administration granted last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said he granted the requests of the oil companies to
extend the leases and give them time to work on exploration plans.
The leases were extended with the condition that no drilling will
take place while environmental review is conducted. But Governor
Gray Davis has argued that the Interior Department and Babbitt
acted illegally when it granted the extensions without permitting a
state review. Bradley said Thursday that the administration should
have told the oil companies regarding the leases, ``If you don't
use it, you lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   LeHane said Gore ``has made it very clear that, as president, he
would not only ban the sale of all future leases, but stop the
development of all nonproductive leases.'' As a result of his
position, the vice president has ``incurred the wrath of big oil,''
he said.

IT JUST WON'T BE A PARTY WITHOUT PAT STEGER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ For San Francisco's high society, it's the
philosophical equivalent of the question about the tree falling in
the forest.
<P>
   Is it really a worthy S.F. social event if Pat Steger isn't
there to gather its essence and weave it into her column in The
Chronicle?
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, there was a major event in S.F. society that Steger
didn't cover, yet there was no doubting its impact. It was her
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   They gathered at St. Ignatius, the cream of Pat Steger's world,
to tell her goodbye and thanks. You never saw so many downcast
face-lifts.
</P>
<P>
   They knew her and adored her and know they will never replace
her as their conduit to the outside world, and to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   If The Chronicle tries to replace her, we'd better advertise for
triplets. I always knew when Steger was on vacation. I'd get items.
She'd send notes and postcards with quirky incidents encountered in
her travels.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that she and I were tight buddies, it was that we were
teammates. Never mind that I never gave her an item.
</P>
<P>
   She saw items even when off duty because a scoop-hound never
rests. I can't wait to see what items she'll send now.
</P>
<P>
   I had a few opportunities to watch Steger work events. She was
like a shark, always moving, looking, listening. And yet so casual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess she's not writing this for tomorrow's paper,'' I
thought. Then I picked up the paper the next morning and there was
her column.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't realize that Steger often hustled up photos for her
column, which shows her extreme devotion to duty. She would either
shoot the pictures herself or borrow a roll from a photog at the
event, and then get the film developed on her own.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sweeney, the doorman at the Sir Francis Drake Hotel, told me
at Steger's funeral that they've been friends for 23 years. She
always dropped off her film for developing at the camera store on
Powell across from Sweeney's post, and they would chat.
</P>
<P>
   Steger died last Sunday, and that camera store went out of
business the same day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Photo finish,'' Sweeney said.

ANGELS ON TIGHT BUDGET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I knew the moment Tony Tavares brought the fiscally prudent Bill
Stoneman in from small market Montreal that the Anaheim Angels
would go on a cost slashing frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of Mike Scioscia, not exactly one of this off
season's ballyhooed managerial candidates, is a prime example of
it.
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered team got Scioscia to pledge his allegiance to
Mickey Mouse, Michael Eisner, Tavares, Stoneman and all those
underachieving Angel players for three years at a measly $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   I think the bullpen catcher for the New York Yankees will earn
more than that over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Why, the Dodgers' on-the-job retiree, Davey Johnson, earns $1.5
million a season.
</P>
<P>
   With Eisner feeling the heat from shareholders disgruntled with
the falling Disney stock prices, it's obvious Eisner and his sports
chief, Tavares, put their noggins together and came to the
conclusion that it would be more tolerable to lose with a modest
Angel payroll than to lose with the large one inflated to more than
$50 million last season by the staggering $80 million, six-year
contract handed out to Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh, are the Angels now doing it on the cheap.
</P>
<P>
   They brought in Stoneman to replace Bill Bavasi as their general
manager for a $400,000 salary, a bonanza for the average American
but a mere pittance for an experienced baseball executive.
</P>
<P>
   They gutted their scouting department, and it's doubtful they
will replenish it with nearly as many competent bodies.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday they made it official at a noon press conference
at Edison Field that Scioscia would be working for them for about
$336,000 a year, which might be far above the income of the common
laborer.
</P>
<P>
   But I hear the new Milwaukee manager, Davey Lopes, is pulling
down slightly more than his old Dodger teammate---$600,000---and
the Brewers' franchise is located in a smaller venue than Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't meant to impute that Mike Scioscia won't be able to
live comfortably on his new wages, nor am I intimating that
Scioscia won't turn out to be as successful a field commander as
his mentor, Tom Lasorda, just because he was signed at a distress
sale price.
</P>
<P>
   But what the hiring of an untried, untested commodity like Mike
Scioscia instead of a proven one like, say, Kevin Kennedy does is
signal the ominous direction that Disney might be taking the Angels
in the upcoming seasons.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure that Stoneman, experienced in tight-fisted
budgetary policies as the long-time caretaker of the Expos'
coffers, will turn the Angels into the Pittsburgh Pirates or
Florida Marlins, or even the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   But the employment of the 40-year-old Scioscia clearly indicates
that the Angels no longer are in the robust spending mood that they
were a year ago when they showered Vaughn with far more money than
he was worth.
</P>
<P>
   The first marquee player who figures to depart the Angel scene
because of the team's new economic dynamics is the free agent
lefthanded pitcher, Chuck Finley, who figures to receive an offer
from a Cleveland or a Texas or a St. Louis that his agent won't be
able to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely going to make every effort to sign Chuck
Finley,'' said Stoneman. ``But the negotiations must fit within our
budget constraints.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Budget constraints'' seem to be Stoneman's two favorite words,
or at least they were throughout Wednesday's session in which he
also announced:
</P>
<P>
   ``We will make our good players available to get some good
pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   But, quickly, Stoneman added, ``The pitchers we get must fit
into our budget constraints.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for the pitching-challenged Angels to acquire anyone
who will faintly resemble Pedro Martinez, or even Ramon Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   But Scioscia, who's as cautious with his rhetoric as he was
tough as a catcher, actually dispensed a quote that raised a few
eyebrows when he was asked about the Angels' pitching corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they did a good job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia can be excused stretching the truth so scandalously,
since he was stuck managing in Albuquerque throughout the summer
and missed the startling histrionics of Tim Belcher (6.73 ERA),
Steve Sparks (5.42), Jarrod Wasburn (5.25), Ken Hill (4.77) and
others whose names aren't even worth mentioning.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia inherits a team that quit on Terry Collins, and has a
lot of spoiled fellows on it not exactly renowned for their
competitive fierceness and keen baseball sense.
</P>
<P>
   This club has some odorous rot in its clubhouse, but Scioscia
doesn't seem worried and kept stressing the need for his
maintaining good communications with his players.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Collins stressed the same thing, but it didn't exactly
work out for him.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia figures to get along better with the Angel players, if
for no other reason than he's a far more physically imposing
specimen than the pint-sized Collins and has a well-earned
reputation as a tough guy.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball players, a notoriously macho lot, tend to listen more
attentively to their manager if they know the guy can beat them up.
. .
</P>
<P>
   _ When I asked Tony Tavares the reason he gave Stoneman the
green light on Scioscia, he replied, ``I talked to six people about
Scioscia, and no one had a negative thing to say about him.'' Gee,
maybe I'll be given a chance to manage the Angels one day because
I'm sure Tavares can unearth six people who wouldn't have a
negative thing to say about me, either. . . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Tavares insists the ultimate decision to hire Scioscia was
Stoneman's. Oh sure, Tony, but only after you gave him permission.
. .
</P>
<P>
   _ When I asked Tavares if the Angels would seriously pursue Ken
Griffey Jr., or Alex Rodriguez, he blanched perceptibly and said,
``Go talk to Stoneman about those guys. I don't make the baseball
personnel decisions any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't waste my time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mike Scioscia has all the standard cliches down pat in his
media responses and I think he will do stellar work with the
Angels, but it won't make any difference.
</P>
<P>
   No manager can win on a consistent basis unless his team has
sound pitching, and it's doubtful the Angels will upgrade
themselves in this area under the regime of Bottom Line Stoneman. .
.
</P>
<P>
   _ I bat .500 when it comes to agreeing with the Nevada State
Athletic Commission fight judges. Half the time I agree with them,
half the time I don't. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Coming out of a 25-year retirement---his three brawls with
fight promoter Don Fraser in the early 1970s were legendary---the
colorful 5-7, 302-pound boxing publicist/actor/gourmand, Bill
(Bozo) Caplan, duked it out with Don King's PR chief, Greg Fritz,
last Saturday night after the Lennox Lewis-Evander Holyfield
heavyweight match.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy called me a big, fat slob,'' explained the 64-year-old
Caplan, who works for Bob Arum. ``I took umbrage with that. I'm a
short, fat slob.''. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ I can't envision Paul (Can't) Hackett's USC Trojans blowing
still another game they shouldn't lose Saturday afternoon, but I
can't envision the Trojans covering the 7-point spread because
Hackett's teams so seldom have. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ While the Long Beach State-Global All-Stars match was nearing
an end the other night, a Big West referee named Chris Shevlin
actually ran past me near my courtside media seat and said over his
shoulder, ``I miss you on radio.'' To which my old partner, Joe
(The Big Nasty) McDonnell cracked, ``I hope the guy is better at
refereeing than he is at judging radio talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, in case you're wondering whatever happened to
McDonnell, he's living in eternal oblivion doing afternoon sports
updates for KFWB and still coming up with big scoops as he did the
other day with his Mike Scioscia-to-the-Angels bombshell. . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Alas, I'll bet anyone my favorite 8 by 10 glossy of Gene Mauch
that Mike Scioscia's happiest, most tranquil day as the Angels'
manager will turn out to be Wednesday. . .

CBS KEEPS NCAA TOURNAMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no money funnier than TV money. Not Monopoly money, not
IPO money, not even Bill Gates money.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, CBS agreed to pay the NCAA $6.2 billion over
11 years for the rights to the NCAA basketball tourney, an average
of $564 million a year, or more than CBS is annually paying the NFL
($500 million) as part of the league's eight-year, $17.6 billion
deal.
</P>
<P>
   March Madness indeed.
</P>
<P>
   For this tidy sum, CBS will keep control of the tourney through
the year 2013. Its current deal, which pays the NCAA $257 million a
year, runs through 2002. CBS also keeps the rights to other NCAA
championships (like the College World Series) and adds licensing,
radio, publication and Internet rights. It can reopen negotiations
after year eight of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   From a viewing perspective, this isn't necessarily good news.
CBS is keeping the whole package to itself and has no plans at the
moment to sell off first- and second-round inventory to a cable
partner.
</P>
<P>
   CBS gained exclusive rights to the tourney in 1990 after sharing
part of it with ESPN. The cable network's manic round-the-clock
coverage of first weekend games beginning in 1992 was a highlight
of the industry, and CBS has been criticized annually for
regionalizing first weekend coverage and its meandering pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Final Four might be the most exciting sports event of
(any) year,'' said CBS President Les Moonves. ``We didn't pay this
kind of money to farm it out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no higher priority than renewing (this deal),'' said
CBS Sports President Sean McManus. ``We have some cable partners
out there, but we haven't even discussed it yet. We've always
maintained the best way to present it is on free TV, and we have no
plan to change (it).''
</P>
<P>
   The key to the deal was CBS' willingness to take on an 11-year
deal that gives the NCAA long-term financial security, as well as
the whole bundled ``new media'' package. Disney/ABC/ESPN and Fox
were also interested, but at fewer years and without the bundle.
</P>
<P>
   The new media package is so new, in fact, that the NCAA and CBS
can't explain what Internet rights even means, and whether it will
spark a fight over what another Internet site can and can't do in
regards to the tournament. CBS is a minority owner of CBS
Sportsline, one of the two dominant sports Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The definition of the Internet changes on an hourly basis,''
said McManus. ``It's a constantly evolving medium. We believe we
can promote and exploit it. It's just difficult to say how right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   As absurd as the numbers may seem, there is some rational
thought behind every big-bucks deal that has come down the last few
years.
</P>
<P>
   As the networks see their audiences sliced by cable, satellite
TV and the Internet, live sports events have become the premium
package in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Even though CBS' ratings for the tourney have been declining
(last year's rating of 17.2 was CBS' lowest ever), it remains a
terrific month-long platform for promoting other network shows.
Whatever losses the actual event may incur are made up by luring
viewers to CBS' other programming.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing sillier than the cash is the length of deals. An
11-year contract sounds patently ridiculous at a time when the
audience has attention deficit disorder, until you realize it locks
all of the other networks out of the hoop loop for more than a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   The current eight-year, $17.6 billion NFL deals runs through
2005 (although the league has an option to open it after 2002). The
$4.2 billion NASCAR deal runs six years for NBC/Turner and eight
years for Fox. The NHL is in the first year of a $600 million,
five-year contract with ABC and ESPN. And the NBA is in year two of
its $2.64 billion four-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   That slurping sound you hear in the background is Bud Selig.
Baseball's deal with Fox and NBC expires after the 2000 season, and
baseball also has a court date soon that could break its deal with
ESPN, which runs through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in network sports remembers how closely CBS Sports came
to closing down completely after losing the NFL's NFC package to
Fox. CBS was simply guarding its turf against a raid by ABC/ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   If you care to blame anyone, blame Disney. The same people
downsizing the Angels are the ones who sent the NFL deal into orbit
with its $900 million-a-year package bid for ABC Monday and ESPN
Sunday night football, and the ones who primed CBS to step up
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, ABC clearly now stands in fourth-place in the network
sports standings. It has less inventory and fewer championship
events than the other three.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has the NFL's NFC package and a place in the Super Bowl
rotation; regular and postseason baseball, plus the World Series
every other year; and the first half of the NASCAR season beginning
in 2001. Its cable side, powered by 22 regional nets, also has
national deals for baseball, college football and NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having lost its part of the NFL package, NBC has the
next five Olympic Games (three summer, two winter); the NBA through
$$$$; postseason baseball for 2000; the second half of the new
NASCAR season; and Wimbledon, golf's U.S. Open and Ryder Cup, Notre
Dame college football and some college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is thriving with the new NCAA deal; the NFL's AFC package
and a Super Bowl in 2001; and golf's Masters and PGA tournaments,
the U.S. Open (tennis), and regular season college football.
</P>
<P>
   ABC lacks championship events. Its Monday Night Football
contract gives it access to a Super Bowl every third year, and it
has the strongest regular season college football package. But the
Bowl Championship Series in college football remains controversial
and unproven, and it amounts to one long weekend. ABC is in the
second year of a $525 million, seven year deal for the four bowl
series.
</P>
<P>
   ABC will televise only four regular season NHL games before a
weekly playoff telecast leading into split coverage with ESPN of
the Stanley Cup finals. ABC also has a modest regular season
college basketball schedule, the British Open and World Cup soccer.
Cable cousin ESPN has Sunday Night Football, plus strong regular
season packages in every sport except the NBA (Turner) and now
NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, CBS will air a monthly NCAA show that will
be issue-driven around college sports. First suggested topic: When
do the players get paid?

FLETCHER DIGS DEEP, KEEPS ON CONTRIBUTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Fletcher spent last Saturday playing football. That is
not news.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher has established himself as one of the most dependable
Ducks since coming to the University of Oregon in 1995. Take away
an ankle injury that wiped out half of his freshman season and
Fletcher has shown up to play in every game since he's been in
Eugene.
</P>
<P>
   However, last Saturday, was hardly a typical afternoon for the
5-foot-10, 200-pound defensive back from Paramount High. Oh, he did
make it to the game and delivered a clutch performance in the 24-19
Pac-10 victory over California.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher's contribution included four punt returns for 46 yards,
including a 37-yarder to set up a short touchdown drive, a pass
interception with a 13-yard return and five tackles. One of those
tackles was a jarring hit on Kyle Boller which ended the Cal
quarterback's freshman season a week early.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad performance for a player competing with a heart
fractured by the death his mother, Marietta Thomas, four days prior
to the game. Thomas, a home care provider, was diagnosed with liver
cancer in June and passed away on Nov. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to get her a (liver) transplant,'' the
22-year-old Fletcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher flew to the family's Compton home on Wednesday morning
to grieve with family members and wasn't sure if he would play on
Saturday in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, when I heard the news, I wasn't sure I wanted to
play,'' Fletcher said after finishing practice on Thursday
afternoon. ``My family wanted me to play. What better way to
represent my mother than doing what I love to do and doing what she
loved watching me do.''
</P>
<P>
   Marietta Thomas also played a role in Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got tired, she kept pushing me,'' Fletcher said. ``I
could hear her telling to keep pushing (and) keep fighting. After
the game, I thanked her for keeping me strong. A lot of guys
wouldn't have played in a situation like that and I might not have
without her support.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon players paid attention to Fletcher's presence on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he showed so much heart,'' Oregon tailback Reuben
Droughns said. ``He knows this was a big game and he knows we're
with him and we'll always be there for him.''
</P>
<P>
   When the game was over, Fletcher enjoyed the victory with his
teammates and talked about this Saturday's Civil War with visiting
Oregon State. Then, he got on a plane headed for Los Angeles. On
Tuesday, Marietta Thomas, was buried and the following day Michael
returned to Eugene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found time at night to relax and make my peace,'' a
surprisingly composed Fletcher said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in the past three years that Fletcher has
survived difficult times. His father, William, died of heart
problems just three days prior to the Ducks contest against Oregon
State on Nov. 22, 1997. Fletcher had eight tackles that day in a
48-30 Oregon victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very similiar,'' Fletcher said. ``I played that game
for my dad and I played pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher, who carried a 23-game streak as a starter into the Cal
game, has played well most of days at Oregon. In his first three
years, Fletcher had 159 tackles from his safety position and
established himself as one of the conference's most dangerous kick
returners.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 games this year, Fletcher has 55 tackles, including three
for loss, one sack, three interceptions, eight pass breakups and a
forced fumble. He also has 31 punt returns for 307 yards, with one
of them being a 57-yard touchdown return against UTEP, and 16
kickoff returns for 355 yards.
</P>
<P>
   However, its two big hits on opposing quarterbacks that Fletcher
has become known for this season.
</P>
<P>
   The first one came when USC's Carson Palmer lowered his shoulder
and tried to run through Fletcher two plays before halftime on
Sept. 25. Palmer suffered a broken collarbone and the Trojans
haven't been the same since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard a lot about that (from USC fans),'' Fletcher said.
``A lot of them down there say I ruined their season. It wasn't my
fault. He could have run out of bounds. It was fair, clean play, so
I can live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Boller scrambled out of the pocket early in the
third quarter and lowered his right shoulder into Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sort of similiar,'' Fletcher said. ``I was back in
coverage, he started to scramble and he went head up against me.
Kyle is a tough kid, but sometimes the quarterback has to get down.
But that's a decision he made.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher's decision to attend Oregon will end when he collects a
degree in Communications at the conclusion of this semester. He
wants to become a sports writer or sportscaster, but not until he
chases an NFL dream.
</P>
<P>
   However, all of that will have to wait until Fletcher and his
teammates try to conclude the season on a six-game winning streak.
The Ducks currently have won four games in succession heading into
Saturday against Oregon State and will end the season in a bowl
game.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, his mother will be there for every step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I step on the field I'm representing my whole
family,'' said Fletcher, who is the second oldest of five siblings.
``My mom has been on my mind every day and that will continue
forever.''

LINCOLN'S PARADOXICAL THANKSGIVING VISION ECHOES THE PSALMS

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``In everything give thanks,'' St. Paul advised in his letter to
the Thessalonians in the Christian New Testament.
 &HT;    With a booming stock market, high employment, the frontier-like
energy of cyberspace and millennial optimism, it is easy to follow
Paul's dictum as we pause for our yearly Thanksgiving celebration.
 &HT;    There's that nagging Y2K computer glitch problem, but otherwise?
This Thanksgiving seems the harbinger of a prosperous new century.
 &HT;    Americans tend to equate Thanksgiving with material prosperity.
``Dear God,'' runs our national prayer, ``Thank you for everything
we have. And bless all those poor people who don't have as much as
we do. Amen.''
 &HT;    Paul's words, ``in everything give thanks,'' serve as a
discomforting reminder for our national celebration. ``Everything''
means giving thanks in all circumstances: good and bad, rich or
poor, health or illness, peace or war. In all things, give thanks
to God.
 &HT;    Although New Englanders have celebrated it since 1630,
Thanksgiving Day only became a national holiday in 1863 when, in
the midst of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln instituted it as a
yearly celebration.
 &HT;    In 1863 the war was a stalemate. Generals won battles and lost
them. The Union gained ground in the West; the Confederacy held
firm in the East. On both sides, troops deserted the army.
 &HT;    Civilians tired of the whole thing. In the summer of 1863,
antiwar riots broke out in Boston and Richmond. Even that year's
Emancipation Proclamation failed to rally expected popular and
political support. General Sherman urged Lincoln to turn the
conflict into total war: ``If need be, take every life, every acre
of land.''
 &HT;    In his annual message to Congress that year, Lincoln himself
showed the war's strain. Ill, lacking his usual insight, and
suffering from recurring nightmares, the president stated that
``Under the sharp discipline of civil war, the nation is beginning
a new life.'' But what new life? Lincoln did not say. It was too
dark for even the usually visionary president to see.
 &HT;    Although hope was obscured, Lincoln still issued his
Thanksgiving Day Proclamation echoing St. Paul's command: ``in
everything give thanks.'' Until World War II, there was no worse
season in American history than the fall of 1863. Give thanks? For
what? Political crises, death, uncertainty, war?
 &HT;    And to whom? Certainly God could not be thanked for such
suffering. America's traditional Protestant God seemed far away.
Countless citizens turned to alternative beliefs -- such as atheism
and spiritualism -- to try to answer the difficult questions raised
by the war.
 &HT;    Lincoln, mired in his own internal religious struggles,
nevertheless believed that human affairs unfolded under the rule of
God. God's will, however imperfectly understood or recognized, was
working itself out through the conflict.
 &HT;    Lincoln did not identify God's cause with that of the Union
Army. Instead, he understood himself as a sinful servant upon whom
God's judgment rested. The only ``side'' is God's. Human beings can
only approximate it.
 &HT;    Therefore, the North should not only give thanks for great
military victories. Rather, the nation should give thanks because,
however mysteriously, God's will was being accomplished through the
suffering. From evil, good. From death, life. Give thanks because
God is found in and through all things.
 &HT;    Lincoln's paradoxical Thanksgiving vision echoes that of the
Psalms in the Hebrew Bible. ``Give thanks to the Lord, for he is
good; for his steadfast love endures forever.'' The Psalms portray
the full range of human experience. Joy, anger, love, hatred, fear,
prosperity, suffering, victory, rage. But they consistently give
thanks to God for everything from God's gracious provision to God's
presence in the midst of evil. In everything, give thanks.
 &HT;    Thankfulness places us rightly before God. By thanking God in
all circumstances, we are reminded we are not ultimately in
control. When we have much, prosperity is a gift. When we have
little, we rest in God's comfort.
 &HT;    Thankfulness is an attitude of mind that keeps us from thinking
too highly of our achievements or thinking too little of our worth
as God's children. Thankfulness breeds the contentment that,
whatever the circumstance, God is with and for us.
 &HT;    This Thanksgiving, give thanks. Not because we invested in the
right stock. But because God is with us, even in the midst of our
prosperity. God has not abandoned America to material success but
is, mercifully and persistently, calling us to remember who we
really are.

   KASHGAR, China _ This exotic Silk Road city doesn't look, smell
or sound like China.
</P>
<P>
   Mosques jut elegant minarets above the low skyline, calling
faithful to prayer in a Turkic-based tongue. Succulent,
cumin-scented lamb chunks broil on sidewalk grills. And wall clocks
in restaurants and shops brazenly herald the hour _ two hours off
official time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Beijing's best efforts to tame this wild western region
of the world's last communist empire, resentment still simmers
against Chinese rule here. At times, it heats into explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Xinjiang ranks with Tibet and Taiwan as China's most worrisome
political flashpoints. Today, Beijing suffers even greater angst
after watching ethnic rebellions spread elsewhere in the world _
Chechnya, East Timor and most of all Kosovo, where NATO intervened
on behalf of ethnic Albanian Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Hostility is most widely and quietly marked here on the clocks
and watches of ethnic Uighurs (pronounced ``WEE-gurs''), the
Muslim, Turkic-speaking descendants of the Huns. They live two
hours behind Beijing time, following the rhythm of the sun instead
of the central government's mandate that all China observe the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps the only safe protest allowed in this region 1,800
miles west of Beijing that has convulsed periodically in riots,
bombings and killings staged by Uighur activists. They are fighting
for independence and full religious freedom in this land of
mountains and desert that comprises one-sixth of all China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had the struggle against separatist activity
throughout our history. It has never ceased,'' acknowledged Ablait
Abdureschit, governor of the Xinjiang (pronounced ``SHIN-jyan'')
Uighur Autonomous Region, and himself a Uighur who is loyal to
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never allow splittists to separate Xinjiang from our
motherland,'' Abdureschit said in a recent interview in the modern
regional capital Urumqi, echoing the determined declarations of
officials from the bottom of the bureaucracy to the top guns in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   China's two-pronged approach to subduing Xinjiang focuses on
economic development, which is aimed at eliminating dissatisfaction
with Chinese rule, and on strong-arm security aimed at eliminating
those who express discontent anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Shi Shaolin, a Han Chinese and deputy commissioner of Kashgar
prefect, is proud of the changes Chinese have brought to this city
of 350,000 and to the still backward countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``After liberation the central government invested lots of money
in this district,'' he said, referring to the 1949 founding of
China's communist regime. ``We paved roads connecting every
township and brought electricity into every town.''
</P>
<P>
   New China also brought millions of Chinese, who both helped
develop the region and diluted the ethnic mix. In 1949, the
non-Chinese population was 93 percent, mostly Uighur, and Chinese
were about 7 percent. By 1997, the more than 17 million population
was 47 percent Uighurs, 42 percent ethnic Chinese, and 11 percent
Kazak and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Han Chinese got the best jobs in government and industry,
and now with their experience elsewhere are making inroads in
commerce, or so the Uighurs complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young Uighur people have little chance to learn new things,
like computers. Uighurs just work in trade. Or they are farmers,''
said one Uigher who did not want his name published for fear of
arrest. He said computers are limited to high government offices,
which rarely are staffed by Uighurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things change very slowly here for us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively high-paying oil industry is one example. The
major oil fields of China National Oil Company employ some 4,000
people, but only about 300 of them are Uighurs, according to vice
president Jia Chengzao.
</P>
<P>
   Irritation is palpable among Uighurs who refuse to go into
Chinese restaurants or snigger in Uighur about Chinese officials
who don't understand the language.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chinese leaders proclaim they respect the local culture
and traditions, they sometimes show little understanding of either.
</P>
<P>
   Two female government officials, both Han Chinese who grew up in
Xinjiang, laughed at a foreign female guest who hurried to buy a
scarf at the bazaar before walking into a mosque. The Chinese went
bareheaded into the cavernous prayer room to meet with the chief
imam.
</P>
<P>
   In other countries they would not be permitted to enter a mosque
bareheaded, but here no one objected. One Uighur Muslim quietly
thanked the foreign visitor for respecting Islam by wearing a
scarf.
</P>
<P>
   Uighurs know that protesting can cost them dearly. Simply
speaking to a foreign visitor without authorization has sent some
Uighurs to jail.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the second tactic of Beijing's strategy here.
</P>
<P>
   The London-based human rights group Amnesty International said
it documented 190 executions in Xinjiang from January 1997, through
last March, or an average of one execution every 4.3 days.
Thousands more have been detained, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   The last large-scale protests erupted in 1997, resulting in mass
arrests and as many as 100 deaths. But security forces have kept
occupied with smaller agitations, such as the six Uighur gunrunners
executed in mid-September, and with preventing big ones.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 28, Xinjiang's public security defused an
anti-government ``political rebellion'' planned to coincide with
China's Oct. 1 national day in Khotan, a center of unrest in south
Xinjiang, according to Abdul Aziza, director of Kashgar's
administration of religion and ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year before Oct. 1 we have a meeting to keep alert for
this kind of riot,'' said Aziza, blaming the separatist activities
on an ``East Turkistan group'' related to an ``Islamic party'' that
he said has branches in every county.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   East Turkistan is the name around which independence-minded
Uighurs rally. Two short-lived Republics of East Turkistan were
proclaimed to exist here in Kashgar in 1933 and in Ili in the north
in 1944, but both fell quickly to Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   While the practice of Islam is permitted, it is strictly
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Its presence is obvious in the working mosques dotting the
countryside, and the mostly older women who cover their heads and
sometimes faces with brown, burlap-like cloths.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of religious suppression during China's Cultural
Revolution the central government in 1977 started rebuilding
destroyed mosques and allowed Islam to re-emerge. But freedoms were
constricted again in the late 1980s, by Chinese leaders apparently
fearing unmanageable growth and radical influences from neighboring
Islamic countries of Central
</P>
<P>
   Asia that split off from the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic imams, or leaders, deemed insufficiently patriotic were
purged, mosque construction halted and schools teaching the Koran,
the Muslim bible, were either outlawed or tightly monitored. At
Kashgar's central Id Kah Mosque, for example, a line of rooms once
used to give Koranic instruction now sit dark and empty.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For now, China looks solidly in control here.
</P>
<P>
   The Uighurs are not so lucky as the Tibetans, who have their
Dalai Lama to center their cause and celebrities like actor Richard
Gere to publicize it in the West. Exiled Uighur activists have 50
Internet Web sites, but the Uighurs are neither united under a
single leader nor do they enjoy the support of any famous Western
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Many Uighurs have made their peace with China, gladly accepting
the railroads and water systems and any new jobs offered.
</P>
<P>
   However, should China suffer the same kind of economic downturn
that led to the Soviet collapse, all bets are off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think China is in danger of falling apart. So in that
sense China has over-reacted (to the separatists),'' said Dru
Gladney, a China-watcher at Honolulu's Asia-Pacific center.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if China should run into (economic) trouble,'' he said,
``there would be these ethnic fault lines.''

<P>
   STAN BERG, Yugoslavia _ With a cold November rain pelting her,
Shensie Mernica rushes to gather in the laundry hanging on a line
by the chaos of bricks, lumber and stone that used to be her
family's house.
</P>
<P>
   The rubble is strewn among the remains of a dozen houses built
on the steep hillside among the mountains of northern Kosovo. The
gold and orange of the trees could be autumn in Appalachia. The air
is damp and cold, and the mornings have begun to feature frost on
the grass and fallen leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Across a muddy footpath a few yards away, her father, Beram
Mernica studies the scene of his 14-year-old daughter working in
the rain. He said the houses were destroyed last February in a
grenade attack by Serbs battling separatist rebels in the village.
Four people in one neighboring family were killed. Mernica
indicated their house with a nod and then looked at what is left of
his.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will take three years to rebuild,'' he says, the cold
rain soaking through his nylon jacket. ``But we will rebuild no
matter how long it takes. What else can we do?''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say when Mernica will see his family sleep in the
warmth of a real house _ an experience they haven't had in 10
months. A week ago, aid workers moved the family of 13 from a tent
near the ruin to an abandoned building at the base of the hill to
settle in before the snow.
</P>
<P>
   They are among the lucky ones.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is just one of 50,000 houses demolished in a particularly
ugly brand of warfare that seemed designed to burn the roof from
over every head in the province. Nearly half the houses in Kosovo
were damaged in the war between Yugoslav forces and ethnic Albanian
separatists. The war ended in June after NATO's 78-day bombing
campaign forced Serb leader Slobodan
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, Yugoslavia's president, to withdraw his troops. Since
then, about 800,000 ethnic Albanian refugees have returned to their
homes to pick up the pieces and start over.
</P>
<P>
   For the legion of international relief groups swarming across
Kosovo, the immediate task is to get everyone into shelter before
the freeze. In the spring, the reconstruction can begin in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a very rough winter ahead,'' said Tom Hurley, the
director of C.A.R.E. International's mission in Kosovo. ``There
will be a lot of people who will be very uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hurley believes the threat of a humanitarian disaster with
widespread loss of life is subsiding. ``I don't think there will be
a lot of deaths,'' he said. ``Our primary mission has been to save
lives, and I think we have accomplished that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the atmosphere is anything but placid. With signs of a
fierce Balkan winter already evident, aid workers seem overwhelmed
by the challenge of providing shelter for the nearly 300,000
Kosovars whose homes were damaged beyond repair. By most accounts,
the shelter effort is running weeks behind schedule, leaving
thousands of people searching for cover as November passes into
December.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations refugee agency had hoped to provide each
family at least one warm, dry room by the onset of winter. But the
challenge of obtaining the materials _ mostly plastic sheeting and
lumber _ and delivering them to Kosovo have forced the relief
community to accept the reality that winter will catch them before
they will get everyone under cover.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Kosovars must help each other _ a capacity they
demonstrated impressively last spring and summer when they were
crammed into refugee camps and the houses of fellow Albanians in
neighboring Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Each family that receives a new roof must house other families,
sometimes two. Many have already left their villages and moved in
with friends or relatives in the cities. The provincial capital
Pristina, for example, has swollen to twice its pre-war population
of 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-November, aid agencies had distributed only half the
nearly 70,000 repair kits designed to allow the former refugees to
spend the winter in their own homes, according to the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agency for International Development, one of the lead
groups providing shelter, has put temporary roofs of heavy plastic
and lumber on only 28 percent of the houses it has targeted. It is
scrambling to get the rest up before the end of December.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Maynard, the head of USAID's disaster assistance relief
team in Pristina, acknowledged the agency has endured delays in
obtaining materials but it now has what it needs to provide the
shelter it promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the work now to increase exponentially over the next
few weeks,'' Maynard said. ``We think that by doing all the things
we plan to do, the Kosovars will survive the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the shelter campaign is reaching its pre-winter
climax just as the supply line into Kosovo from neighboring
Macedonia has become impassable because of a combination of
overwhelmed border guards and a huge surplus of cars, trucks and
military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, the winding 10 miles of two-lane road between
Skopje, the Macedonian capital, and the border crossing at Blace
was bumper-to-bumper. Some truckers had been waiting in line for a
week or more.
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian aid trucks received little preferential treatment
and even NATO vehicles were detained several hours at the border.
Ordinary people who want to cross the border are dropped off as
close to the crossing as traffic permits and then walk across to
find a taxi on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Blace crossing is the same narrow bridge that
would have been employed for a NATO land invasion if the air war
hadn't worked.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Western diplomat in the region said the bottleneck was
perhaps the single greatest challenge to the relief efforts.
Officials are working virtually every day to improve the flow.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems facing Kosovo _ many of them so complex
that many people seem relieved to focus on winter rather than the
future of this troubled place _ there are many encouraging signs.
</P>
<P>
   The rich, black soil in the countryside is plowed and planted
with winter wheat, the first crop for many in two years. Retail
shops in Pristina and other cities are full of merchandise and
fresh produce. People in the streets seem triumphant. In a few
nightclubs, young Albanians dressed in black smoke American
cigarettes and listen to jazz. Children, many of them clad in what
appears to be clothing donated by Americans _ particularly Chicago
Bulls fans _ go to school toting books and papers in new UNICEF
backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have turned to combating a rampant respiratory infection
called by some the ``Kosovo cough'' instead of mending gunshot and
shrapnel wounds.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also still very soon after a war that did not produce
a clear solution to the conflict. Kosovo is still a part of Serbia
and officials in Belgrade show little desire to set it free.
</P>
<P>
   The devastation of a year of warfare will take years to rebuild.
Making things more complicated, the aid community must create a
civil government structure to deliver services and rebuild a
shattered economy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some signs of prosperity, more than 900,000 people _
about half of Kosovo's population _ will receive food assistance
from the World Food Program this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Aid groups expect to be in Kosovo for five to 10 years, and
there is no sign that the precarious security situation will allow
the multinational military force known as KFOR to head home any
time soon.
</P>
<P>
   And the sheer size of the reconstruction effort is daunting.
Take the issue of restoring the province's housing stock. The year
before the war, the province produced only 2,000 new houses. At its
peak production a decade ago _ with the full support of a
relatively healthy Yugoslav economy _ Kosovo added only 7,000 new
houses.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 100,000 damaged houses, the arithmetic suggests
the end of international involvement is very far off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about rebuilding a city the size of Buffalo,''
said C.A.R.E.'s Hurley. ``That takes time.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The holidays are a confusing time in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The former communist country still reckons major holidays by the
Georgian calendar that was abandoned by the rest of Europe in the
16th Century. Russia's New Year's Day, for example, is on January
13.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, Russians will have to join the rest of the
world and pay attention to what they call the ``new'' New Year's as
potential computer problems caused by the so-called ``millennium''
or ``Y2K'' bug.
</P>
<P>
   Russia appears ill-prepared for any Y2K bug problems.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while experts say that the chances of spontaneous
missiles launches or exploding nuclear power stations are
``virtually nil,'' they agree that power outages and dead phone
lines are more than likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have left it to late. Now Russians are not thinking about
solutions, but are making plans to deal with Y2K problems and how
to contain the damage,'' says Ron Lewin, whose company, Teralink
Technologies, works to make Russian companies Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   The ``millennium bug'' is due to a programming shortcut that
used only the last two digits of a year in software to save space.
When the current year ends, computers can confuse 2000 with 1900
and crash as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of such computer glitch-induced hardships lead the
U.S. State Department earlier this month to offer up to 800 embassy
the opportunity to go home for the holidays. The move is expected
to cost U.S. taxpayers up to $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has embassies in more than 100 countries, but
the only four affected by the decision are former Soviet Bloc
countries deemed to be at highest risk: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus
and Moldova.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is mainly a concern for the families,'' said one U.S.
Embassy staffer here who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Most
employees came here and accepted the risk. But their children
didn't. They want to go home because of the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Embassy officials, at least publicly, say there is little to
worry about. But embassy staff members who choose to leave will not
be allowed back into Russia until the ``all clear'' is given by the
State Department. They could spend as much as a month working from
hotel rooms in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can petition to come back early, but there is no choice,''
said one staff member who asked not to be identified. ``At this
point there is no program. It is all uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, played
down the nervous reactions and predicted that only a few dozen
embassy staffers will take up the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most American expatriates here are deciding to brave it
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't heard of anyone packing up and leaving because of
Y2K,'' said Christina Olsson, of the Russia-U.S. Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   She said the pro-business organization is not advising American
executives working here to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is ample room for concern. First, is the
worry that a computer will spontaneously launch one of Russia's
3,000 nuclear missiles that are still in a high state of launch
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Defense Department has been working with its Russian
counterparts for more than a year to troubleshoot any potential
problems. In addition, Russian military personnel will be stationed
at launch information-sharing center at NORAD in Colorado. It goes
into operation at the start of December and will operate through
the first part of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything Y2K has reduced the chances for an accidental
launch,'' says Tom Martins, the head of Environment, Science and
Technology Department at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The other major cause of concern are Russia's nine nuclear power
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Just under three-quarters of electricity in Russia is generated
by thermal power stations that use analogue systems that won't be
affected by Y2K problems. Another 15 percent is generated by
nuclear reactors _most, of the same design as the Chernobyl nuclear
power plant that exploded in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   That doomsday scenario has been uppermost in the minds of U.S.
officials, as the Department of Energy has worked closely with
Russia's International Science and Technology Center and similar
organizations throughout Europe to bolster Russia's stations.
However, U.S. Embassy officials said the chances of a mishap
``approach zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Likely, they said it will be the day-to-day things that will go
wrong. In a report to the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Year
2000 Technological Problems, special advisor John Beyrle said:
``Russia is likely to experience disruptions in its electrical grid
and telecommunications infrastructure, with subsequent effects on
its financial, industrial and government sectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Power outages in Russia are no joke. As the winter starts,
already more than 20 people have died in Moscow alone from the
cold.
</P>
<P>
   A holdover from the old communist system, all houses are heated
by power stations under the control of municipal authorities.
Following last summer's financial crisis, many of these _
especially in the poorest (and coldest) parts of the country _ have
already run out of money for fuel. A house without heating can
spell death to a rural resident.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the phonelines go dead and the heating is turned off,
the U.S. Embassy in Moscow is well supplied and is unlikely to be
affected directly. It has its own back-up supply of food, power
generators, clean water and satellite telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's major cities are also reasonably well-prepared. Experts
expect only minor problems in Moscow and St. Petersburg, where the
bulk of the country's wealth is concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   With the snow already lying thick on the ground, it is the
people in the countryside that are going to suffer the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's new?'' says Teralink Technologies' Lewin. ``It is Y2K
every day in Siberia.''

 &HT;    Atlanta journalism in the thick of D-Day
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Second and last of Jim Minter's columns on his visit to the
American invasion beaches in France.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a radio on in the newsroom when we heard our boss
speaking from England,'' remembers Pat LaHatte, The Atlanta
Journal's picture editor on D-Day. ``Pandemonium broke out.''
</P>
<P>
   This was surely the Journal's finest hour. Managing editor
Wright Bryan, on leave as a war correspondent, had hitched a ride
to France on a C-47 transport carrying paratroopers. Immediately
after landing back in England he was on NBC Radio with arguably the
``scoop'' of the century.
</P>
<P>
   While reporters for the big wire services, the New York and
Chicago newspapers, Edward R. Murrow and Ernie Pyle either sat in
London or floated aboard ships in the invasion armada, the
Journal's man on the scene watched paratroopers jump into battle as
German tracers climbed into the night.
</P>
<P>
   His eyewitness account was distributed to newspapers across the
country. ``WRIGHT BRYAN FLIES TO ATTACK IN TROOP PLANE,'' said the
headline in The Atlanta Journal's Final Home edition. ``Journal
Editor Writes Graphic Account of U.S. Paratroopers' Leap into
Action.,'' added the subhead.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Lockerman covered the local angle. Her headline said,
``D-Day Finds Atlantians in Prayer,'' followed by ``Relatives and
Friends Gather Throughout Day at Church Altars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bells tolled in Atlanta Tuesday,'' she wrote. ``They were not
air-raid alarms, but the age-old summons to prayer that sounded
over the city and united its people into huge congregations of
supplicants. Church members and non-church members, men, women and
children of all beliefs and denominations knelt for prayers for the
success of the invasion, and for the safety of sons, husbands and
friends locked in the titanic struggle of D-Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly,'' says Pat LaHatte. ``We all had friends and
relatives over there.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no computers, no CNN, no electronic typesetting, no
e-mail and no satellite transmissions. Military traffic overloaded
shortwave radio and undersea cables. The Journal managed to get a
single six-column picture through a laborious process of metal
engraving in time for a before noon deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Showing a flotilla of warships protected by barrage balloons,
the picture came from The Associated Press via the Coast Guard and
Army Signal Corps Radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a feat,'' says LaHatte, who wrote the caption Atlantans
read that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were standing on the street, waiting for the paper to
come off the press,'' she recalls. ``We had a board in front of the
newspaper building where we posted pictures we couldn't get in the
newspaper.'' Newsprint rationing had cut the number of pages to a
minimum. According to the index, sports news was on page 14.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters and editors on the firing line that fateful
morning in 1944 went on to greater things in the postwar world.
</P>
<P>
   Wright Bryan, after being captured and spending time as a
prisoner of war, came home to take over as top editor of the
Journal, and later moved to a similar post with the Plain Dealer in
Cleveland, Ohio. In ``retirement'' he served as a vice president of
Clemson University, his alma mater. He died in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Pat LaHatte, the legendary picture editor, became Mrs. J.D.
Langley when she married the championship football coach. Now a
widow, she lives in Berkeley Lake in Gwinnett County, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   She is a serious gardener who makes her own compost and
describes herself as a gadfly. As a Journal-Constitution executive,
she broke serious ground for women in Atlanta business circles, one
of the first four to be admitted into the previously all-male
Commerce Club.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most informed historian of Atlanta journalism in
the 20th century, she kept copies of all the front pages from major
World War II events, from Pearl Harbor through D-Day, the atom bomb
and the two surrenders. I asked her which of those days stands out
as her most unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   She replied without hesitation. ``The day we got the first
pictures from the concentration camp.''
</P>
<P>
   When Patton's Third Army broke into Buchenwald, the toughest of
all American generals was so shocked by what he saw that he called
Gen. Dwight Eisenhower to ask for photographers, so the world could
see.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures, now so horrifyingly familiar, soon arrived on
LaHatte's desk. She had a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal's owner, James M. Cox, former Ohio governor and
Democratic presidential candidate, let local editors make their own
decisions, except for one rule: No pictures of dead bodies in the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took the Buchenwald pictures to a meeting of editors,
the rule came up,'' LaHatte says. ``I said, `We've got to run them.
That's what the war was all about.' Mr. (William) Kirkpatrick, who
was acting managing editor in Wright Bryan's absence, agreed and
told me to put together a full page of pictures.'' Gov. Cox never
complained.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Doris Lockerman moved to the Constitution, where
she became a star columnist. Before coming to Atlanta as the bride
of attorney Allen Lockerman she had written a column for the
Chicago Tribune, and before that was secretary to Melvin Purvis,
the FBI special agent who did work in the John Dillinger gang and
today is well-known to all television watchers.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Lockerman, then a young FBI man, was one of the agents in
Purvis' stakeout who shot the notorious criminal as he came out of
a Chicago movie house, betrayed by the Lady in Red.
</P>
<P>
   Today, her friend Pat LaHatte describes Doris as ``a vigorous
resident of St. Anne's Episcopal Complex'' in Atlanta. She, too,
has vivid memories of the fateful June morning in 1944 when she was
called on to reflect the mood of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if people realized how important that day was,''
she says. ``I'm sure I didn't. So much had happened we were just
overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that pretty much sums up the magnitude of D-Day, the
whole of World War II, and the 20th century. Present and future
generations cannot be expected to fully understand, or appreciate.
The best they can do is figure out enough to heed Gen. Eisenhower's
plea, and try not to let it happen again.
</P>

Journal-Constitution.

 &HT;    Furniture tool list? It depends
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A reader sends along by e-mail a question that can,
and has, required a fairly thick book to answer:
</P>
<P>
   ``To build furniture (desk, chest of drawers, etc.) what shop
equipment is required?''
</P>
<P>
   That depends on several things, such as how good you are with
hand tools, how much time you have (or want) to spend on a project
and, of course, how big your bank account is.
</P>
<P>
   There are two basic directions to take in the craft of fine
woodworking, or furniture building. You can opt to use hand tools
as much as possible, or power tools as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing that can be done with power tools which cannot
be done with hand tools. A collection of hand tools sufficient to
build a chest of drawers will be a good deal less expensive than
the requisite power tools.
</P>
<P>
   However, they will also be a good deal more strenuous to use,
they will require more time to accomplish a given evolution, and,
perhaps most significantly, they will have a considerably higher
learning curve.
</P>
<P>
   The basic bench power tools for furniture building, in my
estimation, are a table saw, a wide-table jointer and a planer, or
a combination jointer-planer. A good router, and a router table for
it, is also essential. You need no other power tools to build
modern furniture.
</P>
<P>
   A band saw and a drill press are nice _ especially the band saw
_ but you can generally get by without either unless you are
considering period furniture pieces with all their filigree and
fancy work.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most difficult hand tool to use properly is the
saw. It takes a lot of perserverance and practice to learn to saw a
straight line, especially over a considerable distance. Personally
I would go back to macrame if required to manually rip 1-inch
edging strips off a 5-foot-long board of oak.
</P>
<P>
   The use of hand planes can be learned more quickly, and a lot of
woodworkers, me included, always use a smooth plane on every stick
of wood going into a piece. Even after jointing an edge on my
jointer, I go over it with a jointer plane to get a smooth surface
for lamination.
</P>
<P>
   But taking an oxidized plank of wood directly from a dealer and
trying to render both faces of it flat and square to each other
with hand planes is, like ripping by hand, out of my league.
</P>
<P>
   Some hand tools are always required. You need a good set of
standard bench chisels. Depending on how you intend to cut your
mortises, you may need a set of mortising chisels. You'll want a
mallet to drive them.
</P>
<P>
   You need the standard layout and marking instruments _ squares
in several sizes, a good tape measure, a mortising marker and
marking knife.
</P>
<P>
   A good 3/8-inch variable speed portable drill will probably
serve you just fine until you decide to indulge in a drill press. A
one-handed pad or oscillating sander will suffice for sanding.

 &HT;    Iams looking for top dog, cat of 20th century
 &HT;    By Lynn Hulsey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Checkers the dog may have saved Richard Nixon's
career, but she's not doing so well in the race for canine lovers'
hearts. The little cocker spaniel is even being beaten by Laika the
Sputnik dog, a rumored Communist.
</P>
<P>
   How's that for irony? Unreconstructed Nixonians can right this
wrong with a few clicks of the computer mouse, casting votes for
their favorite dog or cat in the Iams Co. Top Dog and Top Cat of
the 20th Century competition.
</P>
<P>
   Iams is taking votes through Dec. 5 at its www.iams.com Web
site. Click ``About Dogs'' or ``About Cats'' to vote for pets both
real and fictional and the site will immediately tally the latest
results. The winners will be announced Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes 25 dogs and 14 cats, but if the famous canine
or feline of your choice is not listed, e-mail your favorite to
IamsWebSiteiams.com and it will added to the list.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Garfield was sweeping the cat awards. And Lassie
had Scooby Doo on the run in the dog competition.
</P>
<P>
   But then, isn't Scooby always on the run?

 &HT;    Pilot stability checks `pretty effective'
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Air travelers are usually reassured by the knowledge
that the pilots up front are level-headed professionals who want
just as badly as their passengers to arrive safely.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that a pilot's death wish caused the EgyptAir
disaster poses an unsettling question: Are industry practices and
regulations in the area of mental health adequate to prevent
exceptions to that rule?
</P>
<P>
   Those with knowledge of the system say it does a good job of
keeping emotionally disturbed pilots out of the air, but it isn't
foolproof.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of checks in the system is pretty effective,''
said Richard Harper, an Atlanta doctor and retired vice president
of medical services at United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Dangerously odd pilot behavior ``is just not a mainstream
problem,'' said Kit Darby, president of Air Inc., an Atlanta-based
career counseling service for pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Darby, who is also a pilot for United, added that industry
mental health practices are ``somewhat fuzzy'' and could be called
into question if the suicide theory pans out in the EgyptAir crash.
</P>
<P>
   But calls for tighter rules could also foster concerns about the
ruinous effect of inaccurate tests or vague charges on pilot
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of airline accidents have ever been related to
suicide, and none involved U.S. passenger carriers. However, the
EgyptAir crash would be the third in the past five years involving
a foreign carrier and large loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. airline pilots typically get a psychiatric assessment when
hired, but such tests are not required as part of the periodic
medical exams they get throughout their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, pilots are supposed to tell their government-designated
doctors of any psychiatric problems or treatments, Federal Aviation
Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said.
</P>
<P>
   They are also supposed to disclose legal actions, such as a
drunken driving conviction, that suggest problems. Penalties for
hiding such matters range from medical certificate suspension to
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign pilots flying U.S. routes are supposed to adhere to
international standards that mirror FAA rules, but enforcement is
the responsibility of the home country.
</P>
<P>
   FAA regulations list several mental health diagnoses that would
disqualify a commercial pilot. They include any personality
disorder ``severe enough to have repeatedly manifested itself by
overt acts.'' They also include addictions to alcohol and other
drugs, unless ``there is established clinical evidence ... of
recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the FAA denied 1,259 first- or second-class medical
certificates, the types held by airline pilots, for a wide range of
``neuropsychiatric'' reasons, the agency said. That was out of
293,348 applications for renewals or new certificates.
</P>
<P>
   Two ideas that have been mentioned to tighten the system are
adding periodic psychiatric tests, or a ``fit for duty'' test taken
when a pilot reports for work. The latter would test simple
cognitive skills that might be impaired if a pilot were under
emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   John Mazor, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association,
said the union opposes more tests. He said the problem is too minor
to justify the risk of a pilot's career being derailed by an
inaccurate result.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if nothing's done,'' Mazor added. ``Pilots are
closely watched during their careers by any number of people who
can intervene if they see symptoms of mental health problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Both unions and airlines encourage pilots to report troubling
behavior exhibited by colleagues, and they offer counseling
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a tendency to keep it in the brotherhood, but over
the years reporting has improved,'' said Harper.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA is not automatically informed of off-the-job events or
legal proceedings that call into question a pilot's mental state.
But judges can communicate their concerns to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can and has happened,'' Bergen said.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding when an airline pilot can no longer function safely is
a tricky business that can put careers at risk and create legal
entanglements.
</P>
<P>
   That was borne out in the case of Delta pilot Wayne Witter,
whose story was detailed in a lengthy Wall Street Journal article
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Witter had been flying for Delta for 28 years when he was
arrested for making terroristic threats against his wife during a
domestic blow-up at their home. A judge sent him to a psychiatric
hospital, and in ensuing months doctors gave conflicting diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   The charge later was dropped and Witter's medical certificate
renewed by the FAA, under the condition he get psychiatric
assessments at his next two medical exams. He resumed flying, but
four months later had an altercation with crewmates.
</P>
<P>
   Witter flew for another three months while Delta reviewed the
dispute. Then he was put on sick leave, and the FAA later pulled
his certificate.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot appealed the action to the National Transportation
Safety Board, which reinstated his certificate. By then Witter was
near retirement age, and Delta never let him back in the air. His
lawyers said he was the victim of a system used to punish pilots
who didn't fit the corporate mold or otherwise angered their
supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can build a record to get rid of you,'' one said at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Witter and his attorney said Thursday they did not want to
comment on the topic because of continuing negotiations with Delta.
</P>
<P>
   PRIOR AIRLINE CRASHES BELIEVED CAUSED BY PILOT SUICIDE:
</P>
<P>
   _ In late 1997, the captain of a SilkAir Boeing 737 crashed it
into a swamp in Indonesia, investigators believe. All 104 people
aboard died. The pilot was deeply in debt and had taken out a
multimillion dollar insurance policy. He'd also been the subject of
disciplinary actions by the airline.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1994, a Royal Air Maroc plane crashed, killing 44 people,
after a pilot turned off the autopilot and put the plane into a
dive.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1982, a Japan Airlines flight plunged into the ocean,
killing 24 and injuring 78, in an accident blamed on a suicidal
pilot.
</P>
<P>
   RELATED ACCIDENTS:
</P>
<P>
   _ Last month, an Air Botswana pilot took off in an unoccupied
commuter plane and circled the airport, telling the tower he
planned to crash into buildings. He eventually crashed into other
unoccupied planes, killing only himself.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1994, a Federal Express pilot flying as a passenger
attacked the plane's crew with a hammer and a spear gun, trying to
crash the plane. The crew fought off the attack and landed.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1987, a disgruntled USAir employee boarded a Pacific
Southwest Airlines flight with a gun and, after it was airborne,
burst into the cockpit and killed the pilots. The plane crashed,
and all 43 people on board died.

   MARS _ NASA has Mars in its sights again, and officials are
hoping next week's long-awaited arrival of the Mars Polar Lander
will not be a replay of the embarrassing glitches that turned the
space agency's last mission to the Red Planet a total loss. If all
goes as planned, the NASA's robot lander will touch down shortly
after 3 p.m. Dec. 3, setting the stage for a week of sights _ and
sounds _ unlike anything since spacecraft began visiting the fourth
rock from the sun 39 years ago. Anticipation is already building.
Visitors to the main web site for the mission have been growing

 &HT;    Making sense of Revelation
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For most contemporary Christians, the Book of
Revelation is a tough read. With its fearful beasts and gruesome
depictions of violence, it is easier to shut the Bible before
coming to this vexing last book of the New Testament.
</P>
<P>
   Its first-century author, John, offers a vision of great human
suffering, followed by the return of Christ, who would defeat his
human enemy, the Antichrist, in the Battle of Armageddon. After a
thousand years of peace, good and evil would battle one final time,
before Christ passes judgment on the living and the dead, promising
a heavenly new Jerusalem for the just.
</P>
<P>
   Through the centuries, Revelation has been taken as prophecy,
and the faithful have waited for signs of its fulfillment,
assigning its rich symbolism to events of the day.
</P>
<P>
   During the Crusades, Christians saw the capture of Jerusalem
from the Muslims as a victory over the Antichrist. For 16th-century
Protestant Reformers, the ``whore of Babylon'' mentioned in
Revelation referred to the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman emperor
Nero, as well as Adolph Hitler, Mikhail Gorbachev, and former
President George Bush have all been labeled the ``Antichrist.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, some conservative Protestants still hold to this
prophetic view of Revelation.
</P>
<P>
   But most Bible scholars take a different approach. They believe
that John was writing about the world of his own time, not
predicting the future. ``Revelation was intended to be a comfort
and an encouragement in standing firm in resistance to the demands
of the Roman empire,'' says Thomas Boomershine, a New Testament
professor at United Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Although widespread persecution of Christians had not yet begun,
Christians and others throughout Asia Minor lived under Rome's
military dictatorship. They were required to pay taxes to Rome.
Most significantly, there was great pressure to worship the Roman
emperor as a god.
</P>
<P>
   This cult of emperor worship is what held together the disparate
parts of the Roman empire, Boomershine says. Christians, of course,
had no desire to worship an emperor. But being ruled by Rome had
its benefits. The Romans provided international law and order and
some economic stability. John's powerful vision served as a
reminder to Christians who may have been lulled into getting too
cozy with the Romans.
</P>
<P>
   But why did he write in symbolism? Why all of the beasts and
angels, the plagues and seals, the golden lampstands, the marks on
the hand and forehead? What's with that mysterious number 666?
</P>
<P>
   Symbolism was a convention of apocalyptic writing, Boomershine
says, and Revelation is part of a tradition of apocalypticism that
includes Daniel and Ezekiel in the Old Testament. To be understood,
Revelation must be read in that context.
</P>
<P>
   Theologian J. Nelson Kraybill, writing in the October issue of
Christianity Today, observes that the apocalyptic genre is like
today's political cartoons that depict Democrats as donkeys and
Republicans as elephants. ``We are sophisticated enough to look for
the underlying meaning, and not take the political cartoons
literally. But what happens when someone who has never seen a
political cartoon tries to interpret one?''
</P>
<P>
   David Barr, who teaches religion at Wright State University,
agrees. ``Revelation is through and through a symbolic book,'' not
a prophetic one, says David Barr, the author of ``Tales of the End:
A Narrative Commentary on the Book of Revelation.''
</P>
<P>
   Apocalypticism, he says, goes back 2,000 years before John, to
the Babylonians, and many of the symbols John uses are the same,
such as the pregnant woman who is pursued by the dragon. ``These
myth traditions resonated with people. Revelation took people
(Christians) who were relatively insignificant _ certainly they had
status envy _ and got them to buy into a different way of
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr looks at Revelation as literature, and, in that light, sees
John's words as ``a book of timeless truths, fitting many events in
many eras. Its purpose is to reveal the basic principles on which
God acts throughout history.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, he says, Revelation has been largely a book
of the dissatisfied; among them in more recent times Alan Boesak,
the South African minister who spoke out against apartheid, and
Pablo Richard, a Chilean priest and proponent of ``liberation
theology.''
</P>
<P>
   Revelation has meaning, Barr says, whenever people see ``the
religious institutions in bed with political power, and both are
working together for the advantage of the elite. Read that way,
it's better to see the Beast in ourselves than in our enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Can any part of John's message be taken as prophecy? Barr thinks
not, but Boomershine believes that John did ``anticipate an end to
the world. I believe that he was talking about the final victory of
the kingdom of God, that it would happen sometime in history, yes.
When, he did not know.''
</P>
<P>
   But both Barr and Boomershine strongly agree that, despite its
mention of Armageddon, Revelation is ultimately a book about peace.
``This notion of a final battle is so deeply embedded in Christian
consciousness that they miss the point that no battle is ever
fought in Revelation,'' Barr says. ``Yes, it is a violent book, but
John turns the tables. The lion becomes the lamb. You expect power,
authority and the imposition of God's will. What you get is Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revelation is John's attempt to make sense of his world. In
looking at how John looks at his world, it may help us to find a
new way to look at our world _ just like any good literature.''

 &HT;    Saint's bones draw thousands
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ She is expected to arrive in Boca Raton
at about 11 p.m. Wednesday, accompanied by a police escort, her own
driver and a brown-frocked Carmelite priest. An honor guard of six
men will carry her into the church, and along the way she will be
showered with rose petals. If the fervor of the past seven weeks is
any indication, dozens of flashbulbs will pop and thousands will
watch in awe.
</P>
<P>
   But the guest of honor, Therese Martin, won't say a word. She
can't, she's been dead for 102 years.
</P>
<P>
   Exhumed from a grave in France at the beginning of this century
and encased in a 300 pound reliquary, the bones of St. Therese of
Lisieux have drawn hundreds of thousands of the faithful who
believe that ``The Little Flower'' will deliver their singular
prayers to God's distant ears.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 people are expected to pay their respects over a
three-day stay at St. Jude Church. Several Masses, including one
led by Bishop Anthony O'Connell, will be held before she leaves at
1 p.m. on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the reliquary is scheduled to stop at 128
sites in 89 cities over 117 days. It will leave the U.S. on Jan. 28
from Honolulu, and eventually end up back at the Basilica of St.
Therese of Liseaux in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been anything like this in at least half
century,'' said the Rev. Richard Champaigny, who oversaw her visit
in upstate New York where he estimated 10,000 people came to see
her at his church in 24 hours. ``We had the road to the shrine
lined with elementary school children and when she drove up in the
Therese-Mobile _ that's what they've called it _ they cheered.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman upon whom all this veneration is focused was only 24
when she died of tuberculosis in a cloistered convent in France at
the end of the 19th century. Historians say she was so quiet her
sisters were not sure what to say at her eulogy, but writings about
her childhood and her relationship with God were published soon
after her death and, in Catholic circles at least, she almost
immediately became a household name. Her simple and clearly
articulated devotion inspired millions to serve Jesus devoutly,
quietly and with humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a simple woman, and she made serving God really
accessible,'' said the Rev. Timothy Johnson of St. Jude Church, who
is coordinating Therese's stay in Boca Raton. ``You pretty much
can't go into a church without seeing a statue of her.''
</P>
<P>
   A brief 28 years after her death, Therese was canonized and, in
1997, was named a ``doctor'' of the Roman Catholic Church, a title
bestowed upon saints who have added to the understanding of faith
and God. She joins such august company as St. Thomas Aquinas and is
only the third woman to receive the honor.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever her formal credentials, St. Therese has massive
populist drawing power. In a one-day stop outside of Detroit,
75,000 people stood in line for hours just to walk by her
reliquary. Organizers in Boca Raton say they have been fielding
questions about hotel reservations since April. Dozens of buses are
coming down from Tallahassee, Jacksonville and Orlando because this
is the northernmost stop the reliquary will make in Florida. From
Boca Raton it will go to Hollywood, Miami and then Arlington,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And what can these thousands of people see when they get to the
church? A very ornate box covered by Plexiglas and poster-size
pictures of a kind looking young woman dressed in the traditional
brown and white habit of a Carmelite sister. The bones themselves
will not be visible.
</P>
<P>
   The faithful typically touch the box with roses and say a prayer
asking Therese to petition God on their behalf. The petals of the
rose can then be given to the sick for further intercession,
believers say.
</P>
<P>
   At one church a priest reportedly had to stop visitors from
scraping lint from the carpet over which the casket had been
carried. And in Maryland, a man asked that the van holding the
reliquary drive over his front lawn, hoping Therese would bless the
grass beneath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout history people have always had a need to be close
to God, and I think a relic helps them make a bridge between God
and themselves,'' said the Rev. John McMahon of St. Joan of Arc
Church in Boca Raton. ``The question is how do the saints work?
This isn't about magic words and numbers; it's about transforming,
always transforming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The saints can give us a nudge to make a change ... but we
have got to do the rest.''
</P>
<P>

&HT;        NEW COMMISSION FORMED TO GIVE ENTREPRENEURS VOICE IN
WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Tania Anderson  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 -- A group of entrepreneurs announced
Wednesday the formation of a Washington-based commission that will
work on public policy issues to benefit small high-growth
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The newly-formed National Commission on Entrepreneurship,
careful not to call itself a lobbying organization, said it will
educate local, state and federal government entities on how public
policies affect entrepreneurs starting small companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most entrepreneurs have felt fairly jaded,'' said Chairman
Doug Mellinger. ``We're looking at public policy related to the
entrepreneurial economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission consists of seven board members, including J.R.
Beyster, chairman and chief executive officer of Science
Applications International Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   While commission leaders said they have not yet compiled a list
of legislative priorities, they will be looking at securities laws,
tax provisions, the capital gains tax, intellectual property laws,
labor laws and bankruptcy laws.
</P>
<P>
   The group plans to explore where entrepreneurs are concentrated
and how state and local public policies foster small business
start-ups. For instance, the group looked at venture capital
investments and found that California businesses got 40 percent of
all new venture capital in 1998 and six states received none.
</P>
<P>
   The group is also concerned about international competition and
the business environment in European countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only if American policymakers seek to expand entrepreneurship
throughout the country and maintain and enhance the policy
infrastructure...will the U.S. take such a lead that we will be, in
the end, 'uncatchable,''' said a commission statement.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also plans to take on several research projects,
including a state-by-state breakdown of best practices for
supporting entrepreneurship. It will also compile entrepreneurial
experiences and personal characteristics of the chief executives of
the top 200 Fortune 500 companies.

supporting entrepreneurship. It will also compile entrepreneurial
experiences and personal characteristics of the chief executives of
the top 200 Fortune 500 companies.

   MARS _ NASA has Mars in its sights again, and officials are
hoping next week's long-awaited arrival of the Mars Polar Lander
will not be a replay of the embarrassing glitches that turned the
space agency's last mission to the Red Planet a total loss. If all
goes as planned, the NASA's robot lander will touch down shortly
after 3 p.m. Dec. 3, setting the stage for a week of sights _ and
sounds _ unlike anything since spacecraft began visiting the fourth
rock from the sun 39 years ago. Anticipation is already building.
Visitors to the main web site for the mission have been growing
since mid-year, with more than 8 million hits recorded last month.

A CULINARY TRIP THROUGH THE LAST 100 YEARS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Package includes MILLENNIUM-YEAR-BY-YEAR and 4 takes of
recipes MILLENNIUM-RECIPES) 
By CAROL BIDWELL AND NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the 20th century began, cooking was hard work. There were few
things to make a housewife's life easier, and virtually everything
had to be made from scratch. Even families with modest incomes had
paid ``help'' in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Many housewives counted themselves lucky if they had running
water (yes, a pump counted) inside the house. If not, water had to
be drawn from a well. Wood had to be carried, and a fire had to be
made in the stove.
</P>
<P>
   The cow had to be milked. Coffee was ``boiled up'' in a pot on
the stove, often with a eggshell thrown in for clarity. Biscuits
had to be baked, meat and eggs fried, gravy made, jars of homemade
jam brought from the pantry.
</P>
<P>
   All this and it was only 6 a.m. And there were two more meals to
prepare that same day.
</P>
<P>
   Women's work in the early 1900s was generally in the home, and
much of it was spent growing and preparing food _ and, of course,
cleaning up afterward. Housewives were ready for new advances that
made their lives easier.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, times were prosperous despite _ or perhaps in part
because of _ Prohibition, which drove even the law-abiding to drink
as sweet cocktails masked the taste of bathtub gin. Chinese
restaurants provided a bit of exotica. For ladies, tearooms became
popular, as did gelatin salads, the fruit-filled Lady Baltimore
cake, devil's food cake and pineapple upside-down cake. At the end
of the decade, with the stock market crash, financial havoc was
created on many fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rough financial times in the '30s, Americans loved to
socialize and found affordable ways to do it. Sunday night suppers,
tea parties and one-dish meals made entertaining inexpensive.
Gadgets such as the new electric toaster, waffle iron, percolator
and electric mixer made it fun, too.
</P>
<P>
   There were new things to cook, too: It was in this era that
zucchini and broccoli first became widely available in the United
States. Ruth Wakefield changed American snacking forever when she
chopped up chocolate and mixed it into cookie batter, creating the
first chocolate-chip cookies, which she named Toll House Cookies
after the New England inn she and her husband ran.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking methods became standardized, and assorted cookbooks
began to appear. With the opening of Route 66 between Chicago and
Los Angeles, highway eateries thrived. So did food companies, which
introduced a wealth of new products.
</P>
<P>
   In the '40s _ with the best of American food sent overseas to
soldiers and sailors doing the fighting _ those left at home had to
make do with what was left. Meat, coffee, sugar, butter, cheese and
canned goods were rationed _ if they were available at all. So
housewives _ who might have spent their days working in a defense
plant _ planted victory gardens to provide for their families.
</P>
<P>
   Basic American home cooking was the food of the day. Only the
very rich still had servants. Patriotic housewives saved bacon fat
to use in cakes and made their own jams, jellies and pickles. With
commodities scarce, entertaining was often coffee and dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Housewives also benefited from some foods produced for GIs _
dehydrated soups, dried potatoes, canned biscuits, pudding mixes,
margarine and vegetable oils. After the war, GIs brought home a new
taste for exotic food, especially pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Things changed in the food realm. Frozen and pre-made foods
became available _ and supermarkets made shopping easier. A
prosperous future with an abundance of food _ including gourmet and
convenience foods, plus new and more exotic restaurants _ was on
the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, with World War II and the Korean War over, GI Joe
was home, his wife was back in the kitchen, and that kitchen was
often in the suburbs, where new houses were being built with
fabulous kitchens, patios and barbecues. Beef _ long before any of
us knew about cholesterol _ went on those barbecues. Add a baked
potato, a salad and garlic bread, and you had a meal as American as
apple pie. That's not to say suburbia wasn't a breeding ground for
gourmet cooks, though: Beef Stroganoff and baked Alaska were tops
on any gourmet's list of dishes to perfect.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Swanson was marketing TV dinners, complete
frozen meals the family could eat while watching television. Other
convenience and frozen foods also came into their own. Fast-food
chains got their start and boomed.
</P>
<P>
   The psychedelic '60s were a mishmash of food trends, from fast
food to spa food, from blender gazpacho to fondue, from soul food
to luaus. To really put on the dog, cooks dished up veal Orloff,
beef Wellington, rumaki and more. With the affluence, prosperity
and jet travel of the era, foreign foods became more familiar and
accessible. Ethnic restaurants appeared in ever-increasing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The '70s, known by many as the ``me'' decade, was a time of
singles bars, mood rings, pet rocks, Earth shoes and disco, a time
when even the food had strange names, like Screaming Yellow
Zonkers, Fluffernutters and Harvey Wallbangers. Eventually, though,
dinner parties, cooking classes, nouvelle cuisine, regional
cuisine, the food processor and such trendy foods as goat cheese,
farm-fresh greens, chocolate truffles and specialty produce became
all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   Crock-Pots (electric slow cookers) had moved into the kitchen,
along with bundt pans and granola. And cooks were turning out
zucchini and carrot cakes slathered with cream cheese frosting
along with crepes and quiche. Restaurant favorites were fettuccini
Alfredo, main dish salads, salad bars, ranch dressing and Kahlua.
</P>
<P>
   Americans had had enough of spa food and itty-bitty portions in
the '80s. They wanted comfort food like Mom used to make. Meatloaf
was king again, along with fried chicken, mashed potatoes (although
cooks added garlic) and pizza.
</P>
<P>
   America's power elite and baby boomers had become foodies,
wheeling and dealing over power lunches at high-priced restaurants
and becoming awed by star chefs who became celebrities at a time
when status and style were all-important.
</P>
<P>
   Grazing _ eating a bit of this and a bit of that throughout the
day _ was the ``in'' thing, and so were Cajun and Southwest
cuisine. Salsa replaced ketchup as the favorite condiment. Cooks
could find kiwi, mangoes, mesclun, free-range chickens, goat cheese
and creme fraiche in markets. Pesto was a new favorite, along with
risotto, croissants and muffins. Cholesterol-lowering oat bran made
up for all that comfort. In the home kitchen, heat-and-eat
convenience foods _ with no cooking required _ were popular.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe as a backlash to all that comfort food, in the '90s
Americans became obsessed with fat _ how much in food items and
dishes and how to reduce intake _ along with nutrition, health and
fitness. Supermarkets began devoting more shelf space to nonfat and
low-fat cookies, sour cream, cream cheese, ice cream and products
containing a new low-fat fat named Olestra as manufacturers rushed
to get in on the fat-free, reduced-fat product craze. Some were
good and found a permanent place on the shelves; others were so
poor and disappointing that they disappeared quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, obesity rates soared. Other consumers were into luxury
and quality (super-premium ice creams, fine wines and cheeses, for
instance). Biscotti in an array of flavors became popular. And
bread machines, turning out custom loaves with little effort,
became the rage for home cooks. Foods that were once only available
at ethnic markets were now available in supermarkets. And now it
was possible to order groceries, talk with other cooks and find
recipes on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As you look back over the last century in food, reminisce with
this sampling of some of the most popular recipes. Depending on
your age, you may recall having eaten _ or cooked _ some of them. &QL;

<P>
   Boy, have we come a long way where food's concerned in the last
100 years _ and it's been a delicious and fun-filled journey. At
the outset of the 20th century, getting meals on the table was hard
work. There were no refrigerators, toasters, or gas or electric
ranges. Gadgets and appliances like stand mixers, blenders and food
processors were nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Buying groceries was a time-consuming effort, offering consumers
little choice. Canned, frozen and convenience foods gradually began
to appear. New types of eateries _ including the cafeteria, soda
fountain and fast-food establishments _ offered quicker, more
accessible and less expensive options for eating out.
</P>
<P>
   Self-service grocery stores and giant supermarkets were born.
And the culinary scene exploded with new foods, restaurants and
more.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that Americans greeted each new advance _ from
the introduction of packaged cake and pudding mixes to microwave
ovens and bread machines _ with great enthusiasm?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a listing of some of the products, gadgets and (we've
come to believe) necessities that have helped make our lives in the
kitchen easier over the past century. Some may take you down memory
lane.

UNDATED: ... by Sylvia Lovegren, Macmillan. DEVILED HAM DIP
<TEXT>
<P>
   I remember my mother serving this dip at her book club in the
late 1940s. In fact, it was my job to pass the dips and chips. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 (4 1/2-ounce) can deviled ham &QL; 
1 (3-ounce) package cream cheese, at room temperature &QL; 
2 tablespoons minced yellow onion &QL; 
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard &QL; 
1 tablespoon India relish, pickle relish OR chutney &QL; 
1/2 cup dairy sour cream
</P>
<P>
   Mix all ingredients until smooth. Cover and refrigerate several
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Before serving, let stand at room temperature 30 to 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Mound in a small serving bowl and surround with potato or corn
chips, crackers, cherry tomatoes or bite-size chunks of carrot,
celery, zucchini, broccoli and cauliflower. Makes about 1 1/2 cups.

STROGANOFF CASSEROLE
</P>
<P>
   A '70s and '80s party pleaser that I dug out of my personal

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef chuck &QL; 
1 large yellow onion, coarsely chopped &QL; 
l clove garlic, minced &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Stir-fry beef, onion and garlic in a very large, heavy, nonstick
skillet over moderate heat, breaking up clumps, until meat is
uniformly brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in marjoram and thyme and
cook, stirring often, 3 to 4 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Mix in tomato sauce, cottage cheese, cream cheese, noodles, salt

PORCUPINE MEAT BALLS
</P>
<P>
   The sort of easy, novelty recipe that appealed to cooks in the
'30s appears to have been developed during World War I as a way to
stretch meat. In ``Conservation Recipes'' (1918), compiled by the
Mobilized Women's Organizations of Berkeley and published by the
Berkeley Unit, Council of Defense Women's Committee, there is
something called Rice Meat Balls, a clear forerunner of the recipe
here, which is adapted from ``My Better Homes and Gardens Cook
Book'' (1939). The 1918 version plumps up a pound of round steak
with 1 cup crumbs and 3/4 cup rice. The Better Homes recipe
specifies beef neck, shank or plate ground to order _ not readily
available today. Ground chuck has been substituted. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 1/2 pounds ground beef chuck &QL; 
1/2 cup uncooked converted rice &QL; 
1 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon black pepper &QL; 
1 tablespoon minced yellow onion &QL; 
1 (10 1/2-ounce) can condensed tomato soup &QL; 
1 soup can water
</P>
<P>
   Using hands, mix beef, rice, salt, pepper and onion well and
shape into 1-inch balls.
</P>
<P>
   Mix tomato soup and water in a medium heavy skillet and bring to
simmering over moderate heat.
</P>
<P>
   Add meatballs, adjust heat so mixture bubbles very gently, cover
and simmer 1 hour. Serve accompanied by a crisp green salad. Makes
6 servings.

CALIFORNIA DIP
</P>
<P>
   This may not be ``the mother of all dips,'' but it is surely
America's most beloved. The Lipton Company, whose dry onion soup
mix is the basis of California Dip, doesn't claim to have invented
it. That distinction belongs to an anonymous California cook, who
blended sour cream with the soup mix back in 1954 _ two years after
it hit the market. Beginning in 1958, Lipton included the recipe on
every box of Lipton Recipe Secrets Onion Soup Mix. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 envelope dry onion soup mix &QL; 
2 cups dairy sour cream
</P>
<P>
   Mix ingredients and serve with potato chips, crackers or
bite-size chunks of raw vegetables _ celery, carrots, broccoli or
cauliflower. Makes about 2 cups.

FROZEN FRUIT SALAD
</P>
<P>
   This salad is from ``The Charlotte Cookbook'' published in 1971
by the Junior League of Charlotte, North Carolina. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 (3-ounce) package cream cheese &QL; 
1 tablespoon plus 1 cup whipping cream &QL; 
1/3 cup mayonnaise &QL; 
1 tablespoon lemon juice &QL; 
Dash salt &QL; 
1 cup canned pineapple, drained &QL; 
1 cup orange sections, drained &QL; 
1 cup Royal Ann cherries, drained OR green seedless grapes &QL; 
1/2 cup maraschino cherries, drained &QL; 
3 tablespoons sugar &QL; 
1 cup miniature marshmallows
</P>
<P>
   Blend softened cream cheese, 1 tablespoon cream and mayonnaise.
Add lemon juice and salt. Add fruit, which has been cut in small
pieces. (Any fruit may be substituted.)
</P>
<P>
   Whip remaining 1 cup whipping cream, folding in sugar. Fold
whipped cream, marshmallows and fruit mixture together. Pour into
refrigerator trays or a square pan and freeze until firm. Makes 8
servings.
</P>

   &QL; 
TACO SALAD
</P>
<P>
   This salad arrived with the Tex-Mex fast-food franchise, which
began to pepper the country in the '60s. This recipe for Taco Salad
is adapted from the May 1968 issue of Sunset. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 pound lean ground beef &QL; 
1/4 cup finely chopped yellow onion &QL; 
2 teaspoons chili powder &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce &QL; 
1 medium head iceberg lettuce, shredded &QL; 
1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese &QL; 
2 medium tomatoes, peeled, cored and cut into wedges &QL; 
1 medium avocado, pitted, peeled and sliced (optional) &QL; 
1 1/2 to 2 cups corn chips OR tortilla chips
</P>
<P>
   Crumble beef into a a large nonstick skillet. Add onion and
stir-fry over moderate heat until beef is no longer pink, 6 to 8
minutes. Mix in chili powder, salt and tomato sauce. Bring to a
simmer and keep hot.
</P>
<P>
   Divide lettuce among 4 dinner plates. Top with hot beef mixture
and sprinkle with cheese. Divide tomato wedges, avocado slices and
corn chips among 4 plates, arranging as artfully as possible. Serve
at once. Makes 4 servings. &QL;

BEST-EVER MEAT LOAF
</P>
<P>
   This 1950s meat loaf developed in the Campbell's Soup was
included in ``Campbell's Best-Ever Recipes, 125th Anniversary
Edition'' (1994). &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 can (10 1/2 ounces) condensed tomato OR cream of mushroom soup,
undiluted &QL; 
2 pounds ground beef &QL; 
1 pouch dry onion soup and recipe mix &QL; 
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs &QL; 
1 egg, well beaten &QL; 
1/4 cup water
</P>
<P>
   Lightly coat a 2-quart oblong baking dish with nonstick cooking
spray and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Using hands, mix 1/2 cup tomato soup, ground beef, onion soup
mix, bread crumbs and egg in a large bowl until well blended. Shape
into an 8x4-inch loaf and place in prepared baking dish.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven, uncovered, until a meat
thermometer inserted in center of loaf registers 160 degrees F and
meat is no longer pink, about 1 1/4 hours. Remove from oven and
spoon off fat, reserving 1 to 2 tablespoons drippings.
</P>
<P>
   Mix remaining tomato soup with water and reserved drippings in a
small heavy saucepan, set over moderate heat and cook, stirring
occasionally, just until mixture steams.
</P>
<P>
   Slice meat loaf and top with tomato sauce. Makes 8 servings.

SLOW-COOKER CASSOULET
</P>
<P>
   This particular recipe shows just how far knowledge of this
French country classic had spread by 1975. That was the year Mabel
Hoffman's ``Crockery Cookery'' appeared, the book that taught mass
America how to throw a meal in an electric pot and let it cook
slowly unattended. This recipe is adapted from that award-winning,
five-million-copy best-seller. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 (3- to 3 1/2-pound) chicken, cut up &QL; 
1 leek, trimmed, rinsed and thinly sliced &QL; 
1 clove garlic, minced &QL; 
3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon pepper &QL; 
2 (15-ounce) cans white kidney beans, drained &QL; 
1/2 pound smoked sausage links, sliced 1/2-inch thick &QL; 
1/4 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   Place chicken in a slow cooker and sprinkle evenly with leek,
garlic, parsley, salt and pepper. Spoon beans and sausage on top,
distributing evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Pour in wine, cover and cook on low heat setting until chicken
is tender and meatiest pieces show no signs of pink in center, 5 to
6 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Serve at once, accompanying with steamed rice or small new
potatoes cooked in their skins. Makes 6 servings.

   RIVER ROAD BAKED SWEET POTATOES WITH MARSHMALLOWS
</P>
<P>
   The following recipe is from ``River Road Recipes'' (1959) by
The Junior League of Baton Rouge, Inc. It is more typical of the
sweet potato casseroles popular in the '50s and '60s. Often crushed
pineapple substitutes for milk and sometimes the potatoes are
spiked with sherry. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
8 medium-size sweet potatoes &QL; 
1 cup milk &QL; 
1 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
3 tablespoons sugar &QL; 
1/2 stick butter &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon &QL; 
Few dashes nutmeg &QL; 
1 tablespoon orange juice &QL; 
Marshmallows
</P>
<P>
   Bake sweet potatoes in preheated 350-degree oven until done.
Peel hot potatoes and put through a ricer until mashed. Scald milk
and add vanilla, sugar and butter.
</P>
<P>
   To potatoes add cinnamon, nutmeg and orange juice. Stir. Add
milk mixture to potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Layer 1/2 of the potato mixture in a buttered casserole; add a
layer of marshmallows and remaining potatoes. Bake at 350 degrees F
until very hot. Add a top layer of marshmallows and brown. Makes 8
to 10 servings.
</P>

HOLIDAY POKE CAKE
</P>
<P>
   The original Poke Cake, a beloved classic in the heartland,
seems to have appeared in the early '80s, and this red, white and
green Christmas version in the mid-'90s. This version is from the
1994 Jell-O/Pillsbury ad. &QL; 
1 (1 pound 2.5 ounce) package white cake mix &QL; 
2 cups boiling water &QL; 
1 package (4-serving size) any flavor red gelatin &QL; 
1 package (4-serving size) lime flavor gelatin &QL; 
1 can (16 ounces) creamy vanilla frosting
</P>
<P>
   Prepare, bake and cool cake mix as directed on packages for 2
(9-inch) cake layers. Place cake layers, top sides up, in 2 clean
9-inch round cake pans. Pierce cake with a large fork at 1/2-inch
intervals.
</P>
<P>
   Stir 1 cup boiling water into EACH flavor of gelatin, in
separate bowls, 2 minutes or until dissolved. Carefully pour red
gelatin over one cake and lime gelatin over second cake.
Refrigerate 3 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Dip one cake pan in warm water, 10 seconds; unmold into a
serving plate. Spread with about 1/4 cup frosting. Unmold second
cake layer; carefully place on first layer. Frost top and sides of
cake with remaining frosting. Refrigerate 1 hour or until ready to
serve.
</P>
<P>
   Decorate as directed. Makes 12 servings.

CHEESE STRATA
</P>
<P>
   This recipe _ buttered slices of bread layered into a casserole
with shredded Cheddar and topped with beaten eggs and milk _ begins
appearing under various aliases shortly after the turn of the
century. Sara Rorer (``Mrs. Rorer's New Cook Book,'' 1902), calls
it Cheese Pudding. And ``Good Housekeeping Everyday Cook Book''
(1903), titles it Escalloped Cheese. A few books even call it
Cheese Fondue. Being meatless, filling and frugal, Cheese Strata
was popular during World War I and the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
6 slices firm-textured white bread &QL; 
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter OR margarine, at room temperature
(optional) &QL; 
3 cups coarsely shredded sharp Cheddar cheese &QL; 
3 eggs &QL; 
2 1/2 cups milk &QL; 
1 teaspoon prepared mustard &QL; 
1 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon ground hot red pepper (cayenne)
</P>
<P>
   Spread each slice of bread with butter on 1 side, then quarter
slices. Layer bread and cheese alternately in an ungreased 2- to 2
1/2-quart casserole, beginning with bread and ending with cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk together eggs, milk, mustard, salt and cayenne; pour
evenly over bread mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 325-degree oven, uncovered, 40 to 45 minutes,
until set like custard. Makes 6 servings.

SPAGHETTI SAUCE WITH MEATBALLS
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning (around the turn of the century),
Italian-American restaurants did not serve meatballs with their
spaghetti. These were added to satisfy America's hunger for red
meat. Of course, there are dozens of variations on the theme. But,
the best, to my mind, is this make-ahead spaghetti sauce with
meatballs, cooked up by Sharon Bates, a recipe I featured in a 1992
Family Circle article. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MEATBALLS: &QL; 
1 1/4 pounds lean ground beef &QL; 
1 egg &QL; 
1/4 cup Italian-seasoned dry bread crumbs &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1/8 teaspoon black pepper &QL; 
SAUCE: &QL; 
3/4 pound hot Italian sausage, thickly sliced &QL; 
5 (14 1/2-ounce) cans stewed tomatoes, with their juice &QL; 
1 (15-ounce) can tomato puree &QL; 
1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste &QL; 
1/2 pound mushrooms, wiped clean and chopped &QL; 
2 large ribs celery, chopped &QL; 
1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper &QL; 
1 clove garlic, minced &QL; 
1 1/2 teaspoons Italian herb seasoning &QL; 
1 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   For Meatballs, coat a 15 1/2x10 1/2x1-inch jelly-roll pan with
nonstick cooking spray; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Using hands, mix all meatball ingredients thoroughly. Shape into
1-inch balls; arrange on pan. Bake in preheated 375-degree oven 12
to 15 minutes until uniformly browned.
</P>
<P>
   For Sauce, brown sausages in a large heavy kettle, over
moderately high heat until most of drippings cook out, 8 to 10
minutes. Pour off drippings. Reduce heat to moderate, add meatballs
and all sauce ingredients and bring to a boil. Adjust heat so
mixture bubbles generously, cover and simmer very slowly for 3
hours, stirring, as needed, to prevent sticking.
</P>
<P>
   Cool mixture, ladle into food freezer containers, date, label
and store in 0 degrees F freezer. Makes 1 gallon.

of recipes published in 1955 by the Women's National Press Club of
Washington, D.C.

FRENCH SILK PIE
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate pies began showing up in early 1900s cookbooks. This
rich and silky smooth recipe is adapted from one that first
appeared in ``Better Homes and Gardens All-Time Favorite Pies''
(1978), then reappeared in a salmonella-proof version in the 1996
edition of the ``Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book.''  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
3/4 cup sugar &QL; 
3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) butter (do not substitute) &QL; 
1 (6-ounce) package semisweet chocolate chips, melted and cooled &QL; 
1 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
3/4 cup frozen, thawed egg product &QL; 
1 (9-inch) baked pie shell &QL; 
1 cup heavy whipping cream, stiffly whipped &QL; 
Chocolate curls for garnish (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Cream sugar and butter in an electric mixer bowl at medium
speed, 4 minutes, until fluffy. Stir in cooled chocolate and
vanilla, then gradually add egg product and beat at high speed,
scraping sides of bowl constantly until light and fluffy.
</P>
<P>
   Turn filling into pie shell, cover and chill overnight or until
set.
</P>
<P>
   Swirl whipped cream over top and sprinkle with chocolate curls.
Keep any leftovers refrigerated.Makes 1 (9-inch) pie.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
IMPOSSIBLE COCONUT PIE
</P>
<P>
   In 1978 Bisquick published a recipe for its first ``impossible
pie'' _ Impossible Coconut Pie _ so named because the mixture
formed its own crust as it baked. About 100 more ``impossible'' pie
recipes were later developed. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
2 cups milk &QL; 
3/4 cup sugar &QL; 
1/2 cup buttermilk baking mix (Bisquick) &QL; 
1/4 cup margarine OR butter &QL; 
4 eggs &QL; 
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla &QL; 
1 cup flaked OR shredded coconut
</P>
<P>
   Grease a 9x1 1/4-inch or 10x1 1/2-inch pie plate.
</P>
<P>
   Place all ingredients in a blender. Cover and blend 15 seconds
on high speed. Pour into pie plate.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 50 to 55 minutes or until
golden brown and a knife inserted in center comes out clean. Makes
8 servings.

MOCK APPLE PIE
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine, even during the depths of the Depression,
having crackers around, but no apples. Still, that's the period
when this recipe was developed by Ritz crackers. &QL;

DILLY CASSEROLE BREAD
</P>
<P>
   Few Bake-Off Contest Grand Prize winners are more popular than
this one, which has become an American classic. It was the creation
of a Nebraska cook named Leona P. Schnuelle, who entered it in the
1960 Bake-Off Contest &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
2 to 2 2/3 cups all-purpose flour OR unbleached flour, lightly
spooned into a measure and leveled off &QL; 
2 tablespoons sugar &QL; 
2 to 3 teaspoons instant minced onion &QL; 
2 teaspoons dill seeds &QL; 
1 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon baking soda &QL; 
1 envelope active dry yeast &QL; 
1/4 cup very warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees F) &QL; 
1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons margarine OR butter &QL; 
1 cup cream-style cottage cheese &QL; 
1 egg &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon coarse salt (optional)

salt, baking soda and yeast in a large electric mixer bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Heat water, 1 tablespoon margarine and cottage cheese in a small
saucepan, over moderately low heat, until very warm (120 degrees to
130 degrees F).
</P>
<P>
   Add warm liquid and egg to mixer bowl and beat at low speed
until mixture is moistened. Increase mixer speed to medium and beat
3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   By hand, stir in remaining 1 to 1 2/3 cups flour to form a stiff
batter.

</P>
<P>
   Toward end of rising, grease a 1 1/2- to 2-quart casserole well;

NOTRE DAME IS NOT BOWLING ANYONE OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're tired. They're frustrated. They're hurt. At best, they
will finish with a mediocre 7-5 record and get a bid to a mid-major
bowl like the Insight.Com in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the thought of accepting a bowl bid with
those credentials would have been denied without a second thought.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, when Notre Dame football was a religious
experience on Saturday afternoons in the fall. When College
Football America took its cue from what happened under the Golden
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   This is now. And it's not pretty for longtime followers of the
Irish to accept. Notre Dame football has become . . . ordinary,
which is the harshest thing you can say about the program.
</P>
<P>
   That the team is even considering a bowl bid with such a record
shows you how low the bar has been dropped in South Bend.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, coach Bob Davie said earlier this week that no decision
on any bowl has been made.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can any be made until after Thanksgiving, even if the Irish
beat Boston College Saturday, since Notre Dame must beat BC then
Stanford next week to become bowl eligible at 7-5, which is the
minimum number of wins for a team that plays a 12-game schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: What has happened in South Bend? How did Notre
Dame become Indiana or North Carolina State all of a sudden, a
major program that flirts with .500 and is among the also-rans
sooner rather than later in a season?
</P>
<P>
   Most of it has to do with recruiting and the diffusion of talent
across the country with scholarship reductions. Going to Notre Dame
is not that big a deal anymore to the scholar-athletes the Irish
target.
</P>
<P>
   There are other choices. Almost every school and league has some
kind of television package. As an independent, the Irish have no
parachute offered by members of the major conferences, which
guarantee the coveted Bowl Championship Series slots to conference
winners.
</P>
<P>
   As an independent, Notre Dame's schedule is almost suicidal.
Michigan, Michigan State, Purdue, Southern Cal, Arizona State,
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   It all looks nice for television ratings, but for a coach, it
looks like a season of misery unless everyone stays healthy and
everyone plays up to their potential.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't happened this season for the Irish, who are missing
16 players because of injuries and have had five others leave the
team for various reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Who puts Notre Dame No. 1 on their wish list right now? The
blue-chip quarterback? Sorry. He can go to Miami or Georgia Tech or
Florida or Purdue. The big-time running back? He can go to Virginia
or Wisconsin. The wide receiver? He can go to Florida State or
Arizona State. The linemen? They can go to Nebraska or Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And if education is the sole purpose, Duke and Stanford offer a
collegiate experience and big-time football, while Ovy League
schools provide a great edcuation and decent football.
</P>
<P>
   During Lou Holtz's tenure in South Bend, the Irish won a
national championship and 100 games in 11 years, probably as good
ets. But Holtz also fiddled with the recruiting classes,
pushing the envelope on who could get in and who could not. The gap
between the football team and the student body widened, was closed,
and widened again as Holtz struggled with the dilemma of all
coaches who have come to the Golden Dome _ find students who are
athletes, who are good enough to win at the heighest level, and
maintain the academic integrity of the university.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of his predecessors, Holtz burned out under the harsh
scrutiny. Now Davie, finishing his third year, is being judged.
Holtz won a national championship in his third season, so did Dan
Devine and Ara Parseghian.
</P>
<P>
   That obviously won't haappen this season. People are questioning
whether Davie has the right stuff.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fair question that has yet to be answered. Like those who
came before him, including the ill-fated Gerry Faust, Davie
deserves the full five-year run that Notre Dame gives all its
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule will not get easier next year, when Nebraska is
added to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that few Irish eyes are smiling these days when
Notre Dame football is discussed, if it is discussed at all.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in South Bend this week has been devoid of anger or
resentment over a team that is now 5-5, with a loss to Pittsburgh,
a loss to Tennessee, and a near-loss to Navy as its last three
results.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is anything that can kill a relationship or a
program, it is indifference, which means the flame of passion has
been extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, that seems to be what has happened at Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>

   With Rhode Island looking for a new football coach, Rams
officals could do worse than looking to Curry College where Steve
Nelson has done a nice job of reviving that Division 3 program.
Nellie would be a natural fit for URI, someone with name
recognition that could get the Rams jump started, as well as a
proven ability as leader and a coach who can turn a program around
. . . The firing of LSU coach Gerry DiNardo last week was not a
surprise, but give athletic director Joe Dean credit for honesty,
if nothing else. ``Basically, he didn't win enough football
games,'' said Dean, referring to last year's 4-7 mark and this
year's 2-8 record. Dean wants to have a replacement by the first
week of December. Reportedly, the Tigers are looking at Texas A&AMP;M
coach R.C. Slocum, who was under consideration five years ago when
DiNardo was hired. Slocum, who has strong Louisiana ties _ he went
to McNeese State _ did nothing to diffuse the rumors this week. ``I
have a lot of respect for that school,'' he said, ``but that has
nothing to do with getting our team ready to play Texas.'' Slocum
is in the first year of a new seven-year deal and it will require a
payment of $1.8 million . . . The NCAA slapped Division 3 St.
John's with a three-year probation last week. The crime? The school
practiced in pads a few days earlier than rules permitted. Hmm.
What does that mean for Minnesota, which had a major case of
academic fraud? . . . Watch out for UMass. The Minutemen seem
poised for another national chanmpionship run. All they have to do
to clinch a 1-AA playoff berth is beat UConn, something they didn't
do in two tries last season . . . If the Minutemen do get the berth
and win at least a couple of playoff games, consider coach Mark
Whipple on the endangered species list for a move to Division 1-A .
. . Everyone thinks Florida-Florida State is a big deal, which it
is. But in Idaho, nothing is bigger than Saturday's Idaho-Boise
State battle, which will decide the Big West title and give the
winner a berth in the Humanitarian Bowl. In Conference USA,
Southern Miss. and Louisville will battle for a Liberty Bowl berth
Saturday. Want a Coach of the Year candidate? Try Hawaii's June
Jones, who has taken the Rainbows from a winless season last year
and a 19-game losing streak to a share of the WAC title. If Fresno
loses to San Jose State Saturday the Rainbows will earn the title
outright . . . How's this for bad timing. At last week's
Rutgers-Syracuse game, Scarlet Knights radio announcer Bruce
Johnson had to leave early because of a commitment to broadcast the
No. 4 fourth-ranked Rutgers women's basketball team playing a game
in Tennessee against North Carolina State. Naturally, the football
team wins in overtime and Johnson's backup, Neal Solondz, has
soundbites of the finish on all the highlight shows. Oh yeah, the
women's basketball team lost.

HOT CHILDREN'S TOYS FOR THE HOLIDAY SEASON

   &UR;  &LR; Those charming metal pedal-powered kiddie cars are back, now
manufactured by Sacramento-based Glide Ride. They offer a fire
truck ($249), Checker cab ($229), dump truck and a police car (both
$259). They closely resemble the Murray kiddie cars of the '50s,
but these are meant to be played with, not merely collected.
</P>
<P>
   Glide Rides are made of 18-gauge steel and coated with a
lead-free powdered paint that makes them rust-resistant (another
big improvement over their predecessors). Suited for ages 2-6, the
pedal system has five easily adjustable positions for growing
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Kids may not have the good judgment to ask for one but they are
sure to love them, and the cars are incredibly appealing to parents
with happy motoring memories. Sold fully assembled at Cherish'd,
Woodland Hills; Kae &AMP; Shelly's Hallmark, Thousand Oaks; Coppa
Automotive, San Pedro; and G&AMP;L Collectibles, Covina.
</P>
<P>
   Bop It Extreme is a five-way version of Parker Bros.' already
popular Bop It coordination and reflex game. The hand-held gadget
sets a rhythm and cues the player to bop it, pull it, twist it,
flick it, spin it and pass it in time to the beat or he's out.
</P>
<P>
   Improved coordination is rewarded with faster tempos. Bop It
Extreme was a big hit among Daily News staffers who tried it. The
suggested retail price is $24.99, but we've seen it around town for
$20-$30. Available at most toy and mass merchandise stores.
</P>
<P>
   Music Blocks, made by Neurosmith, is a guaranteed painless way
to introduce children to classical music and orchestra sounds. The
electronic toy comes with a cartridge to play Mozart's Night Music,
but exactly how it is played is up to the user.
</P>
<P>
   Each of five blocks plays a certain phrase from the well-known
piece, allowing users to rearrange the measures by moving the
blocks. And each of a block's six sides, marked by a shape,
represents a different performance of that phrase _ say, woodwinds,
strings or vocals.
</P>
<P>
   Neurosmith says there are a million different ways to play one
work. For even more variety, there are Rhythms of the World and
Sounds of the Symphony cartridges sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer says it's suited to ages 2 and older, but don't
let that starting age and the primary colors fool you. This is
stimulating and fun for all ages. About $70 at specialty toy stores
such as Zany Brainy and Store of Knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   If wrestling-themed stuff is a must-have, WCW Tuff Talkin'
Wrestlers from Toy Biz can be a lot of fun. Goldberg and Kevin
Nash, sold as a pair, have the technology to recognize each other
and personalize their banter as their mouths move. Each figure also
makes grunting or ``oof'' noises on contact. When pinned on their
backs, an announcer three-counts them out.
</P>
<P>
   Although we didn't push them to the limit, they appear sturdy
enough to withstand a lot of punishment. The series also includes
Sting and Diamond Dallas Page pairing. Each pair costs about $40.
They're available at mass merchandise and toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   Riding skateboards is not just a boy thing, as Skateboard
Shannen knows. With Shannen, Mattel gives young kids a simple, fun
introduction to radio-controlled toys. With manipulation of two
easy-to-use joysticks, she goes forward, backward and spins
wheelies. She can get up pretty good speed for jumps, and has a
helmet and elbow pads for rough landings. About $40 at toy and mass
merchandise stores.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Marshall collectible dolls are 15{ inches of high-quality
glamour _ what Barbie aspired to be in her early years before
Mattel cut a great deal on hot pink fabrics. Gene is a Hollywood
star of the '40s and '50s whose elegant wardrobe is part haute
couture, part studio costume department.
</P>
<P>
   Now in her fourth season through the Ashton-Drake Galleries mail
order and specialty doll stores, this is the first year the company
offers Simply Gene, a bathing-suit clad doll _ blond, brunet or
redhead _ for $49.95, including a hairstyling guide.
</P>
<P>
   As in past years, there are completely outfitted dolls with just
the right hairstyle and accessories, such as the Champagne Supper
copper satin and fur ensemble, for $79.95. Available at the Doll
Shoppe, Sherman Oaks; Gallery Decor/Carlin's, Glendale; Thru
Children's Eyes, Thousand Oaks; Dolls on Broadway, Long Beach; and
Bea's House of Dolls, Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MARGINS &LR; :
</P>
<P>
   The end is near for Beanie Babies, or so says manufacturer Ty
Inc., which announced a couple of months ago it will quit
production of all Beanie Babies on Dec. 31. The ultimate
collectible Beanie, a black bear with The End and a fireworks burst
embroidered on its chest, has a suggested retail price around $6,
but some sellers are seizing the opportunity to scalp. You can pay
as little as $5.99 at Play Co. Toys and $6.50 at Amy's Hallmark,
both in Woodland Hills, but blink and you'll miss them. Or you can
pay $49.95 on eToys or $59.95 at the Beanie Baby stall at Woodland
Hills Promenade where they are readily available.
</P>
<P>
   Matchbox CAT Power Machines from Mattel are scaled similar to
Tonka trucks and have no-battery motor actions. For example, a
lever on the side of the dump truck raises and lowers the truck
bed. But unlike Tonkas, they are made of sturdy plastic that won't
rust. Just grab them from the sandbox, douse them in the kiddie
pool or turn the hose on them and they're ready for inside play.
About $15 at toy stores and mass merchandise stores.
</P>
<P>
   For little biker wanna-bes, Power Wheels has a piglet version of
a hog. The Harley-Davidson sports ``outrigger wheels'' on the back
to provide tricycle stability, concealed under exaggerated running
boards and exhaust pipes. About $200 at Toys `R' Us, including a
battery pack and charger.
</P>
<P>
   Most kids love to get dizzy, and Dizzy Disc Jr. from Quantum
Toys offers a pretty safe but challenging way to do it. They can
sit, kneel or stand on the round swiveling platform, which can be
set level or cocked at an angle to make it even more fun. It has a
stabilizing base and a built-in handle for portability, and can
hold up to 150 pounds. Parents will like the idea that Dizzy Disc
improves balance and coordination for sports and dance, but kids
will just like to spin and fall down. About $50 at specialty toy
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Cloth-body Singing Steve and Blue from Nick Jr.'s popular
preschool series ``Blue's Clues'' sing songs from the show, and
come packaged in a box with a red Thinking Chair that can be cut
out. That makes it easy for young fans to make up their own Blue's
Clues games at home. About $35 at most toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   Excalibur Electronics Talking Electronic Dart Board is aimed at
ages 9 and older, but comes with less-than-lethal plastic-tipped
darts. At about $100, it's a bit pricey, but it costs a lot less
than hiring a referee. This board knows the rules to five different
games and keeps score. As with other safety-dart games, some
bounce-outs do occur, but since the board is pressure-sensitive it
counts the contact anyway unless players choose to disqualify
bounce-outs. The package comes with replacement tips and six
American flag and Union Jack flights. Available online through
eToys.
</P>
<P>
   Does someone on your gift list have a hankering to try pottery?
No need to rewire the house for a kiln. Imagine Nation has come out
with a Deluxe Pottery Wheel equipped with air-dry clay requiring no
baking. The kit includes paints and mosaics, and extra clay can be
purchased at art supply stores. The wheel runs on four D batteries
or with an adapter sold separately. About $30 at Store of
Knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   In board games, everything old is new again. Tried-and-true
Monopoly has a Star Wars Episode I edition that begins at the
low-rent Naboo Swamps and ends at Coruscant, headquarters of the
Jedi Council, deemed equivalent to Boardwalk. The currency is
Republic credits instead of dollars, but there still are familiar
elements, such as the look of the dreaded jail corner. About $60 at
toy stores, mass merchandise stores and specialty stores.
Monopoly's manufacturer, USAoply, also has a new Scrabble Jr. game
with a Madeline theme. The words already are printed on the board,
so players just have to draw the right letters to fill in the board
and score points. Or play it in French on the reverse side. Mais
oui. About $20 at toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   The bad girl of TV's ``Rugrats'' and her African-American friend
have been all dolled up by Mattel as Make-Up Pretty Angelica and
Make-Up Pretty Susie, widely predicted to be hot sellers this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Both soft-bodied dolls have pink tutus, crowns and long skirts
that can be added under the tutu. Angelica comes with her blond
hair in pigtails, but with some work it can be restyled into an
updo, unusual for a vinyl doll. Unfortunately, the main attraction
_ the lipstick, rouge and eyeshadow that emerge or wash off with a
little water _ seems to be their biggest flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Three dolls we've seen did not react as promised on the package,
although Mattel reports it has not received complaints. A very
frank 5-year-old girl said she wasn't interested in playing with
Angelica if she couldn't do her makeup. About $20 at toy and mass
merchandise stores.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie has a desk job and she can't stop talking about it. Press
a button in Working Woman Barbie's back and she says, ``It's
payday. Earning money is fun,'' ``Let's have a meeting'' and other
things we all say at the office, as well as Barbie-isms like ``I
can't wait to go dancing with Ken tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Her accessories include a laptop computer, cellular phone,
coffee mug and file folders. She can shed her blazer and turn her
gray skirt inside out, transforming it into a sparkly red chiffon
number fit for a night on the town.
</P>
<P>
   The enclosed CD-Rom allows players to make their own stationery,
design a cover of Working Woman magazine and do other activities.
Mattel has included replaceable batteries. About $30 at most toy
and mass merchandise stores. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
LITTLE STUFF, LITTLE PRICES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If you are desperately seeking Pikachu, Pokemon trading card
sets are hard to come by at Toys `R' Us because of the high demand,
but they are in stock at smaller toy stores such as Play Co., KB
Toys, Gamekeeper and Target, all of which sell booster packs for
about $4.
</P>
<P>
   Tangle Pen is a snaky looking ballpoint that comes in four
interchangeable segments, each with a different color and texture
on the outside and a different color ink. There also is a mini roll
of paper in the end, great for slipping smaller-than-cookie-fortune
notes to friends. About $9 at Store of Knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   For babies and older kids who still like to play in the tub,
check out Shakin' Bath Toys, made by Kids II. They are crinkly,
colorful frogs, fish and turtles that start vibrating across the
water when a string is pulled. They sell for $2.99 each exclusively
at Wal-Mart's infants departments.
</P>
<P>
   Bendos from Kid Galaxy are 45 quirky and very pliable characters
that could be the next collectible craze. Bendos are a good
diversion in cars, restaurants, doctors' waiting rooms and anyplace
else kids get fidgety. About $5 at toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   To stash the goods, Zany Brainy has stockings and dreidl bags
that are roomy, nice-looking and well-made for a few years' use _
and they're only $5 each. At that price they make a clever
gift-wrap idea.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEB TOYS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Experts are predicting that more toys will be purchased online
this holiday season than ever. There are several options on the
Web, including eToys.com, ToysRUs.com, SmarterKids.com, KBkids.com,
Toysmart.com, eHobbies.com and ZanyBrainy.com.
</P>
<P>
   Online might be the best way to go for the stuff in highest
demand; eToys advises you while shopping if an item is out of stock
and will notify you by e-mail when it's available. Some, such as
SmarterKids and Toysmart, are offering shipping bargains for early
shoppers, and ToysRUs and KBkids will accept returns or exchanges
of online purchases in their stores. If the item is shipped from
out of state, you can save on the sales tax, which defrays the
shipping charges. Many sites also will giftwrap for an additional
charge.

   MOSCOW _ The holidays are a confusing time in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The former communist country still reckons major holidays by the
Julian calendar that was abandoned by the rest of Europe in the
16th Century. Russia's New Year's Day, for example, is on January
13.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, Russians will have to join the rest of the
world and pay attention to what they call the ``new'' New Year's as
potential computer problems caused by the so-called ``millennium''
or ``Y2K'' bug.
</P>
<P>
   Russia appears ill-prepared for any Y2K bug problems.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while experts say that the chances of spontaneous
missiles launches or exploding nuclear power stations are
``virtually nil,'' they agree that power outages and dead phone
lines are more than likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have left it to late. Now Russians are not thinking about
solutions, but are making plans to deal with Y2K problems and how
to contain the damage,'' says Ron Lewin, whose company, Teralink
Technologies, works to make Russian companies Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   The ``millennium bug'' is due to a programming shortcut that
used only the last two digits of a year in software to save space.
When the current year ends, computers can confuse 2000 with 1900
and crash as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of such computer glitch-induced hardships lead the
U.S. State Department earlier this month to offer up to 800 embassy
the opportunity to go home for the holidays. The move is expected
to cost U.S. taxpayers up to $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has embassies in more than 100 countries, but
the only four affected by the decision are former Soviet Bloc
countries deemed to be at highest risk: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus
and Moldova.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is mainly a concern for the families,'' said one U.S.
Embassy staffer here who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Most
employees came here and accepted the risk. But their children
didn't. They want to go home because of the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Embassy officials, at least publicly, say there is little to
worry about. But embassy staff members who choose to leave will not
be allowed back into Russia until the ``all clear'' is given by the
State Department. They could spend as much as a month working from
hotel rooms in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can petition to come back early, but there is no choice,''
said one staff member who asked not to be identified. ``At this
point there is no program. It is all uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, played
down the nervous reactions and predicted that only a few dozen
embassy staffers will take up the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most American expatriates here are deciding to brave it
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't heard of anyone packing up and leaving because of
Y2K,'' said Christina Olsson, of the Russia-U.S. Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   She said the pro-business organization is not advising American
executives working here to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is ample room for concern. First, is the
worry that a computer will spontaneously launch one of Russia's
3,000 nuclear missiles that are still in a high state of launch
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Defense Department has been working with its Russian
counterparts for more than a year to troubleshoot any potential
problems. In addition, Russian military personnel will be stationed
at launch information-sharing center at NORAD in Colorado. It goes
into operation at the start of December and will operate through
the first part of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything Y2K has reduced the chances for an accidental
launch,'' says Tom Martins, the head of Environment, Science and
Technology Department at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The other major cause of concern are Russia's nine nuclear power
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Just under three-quarters of electricity in Russia is generated
by thermal power stations that use analogue systems that won't be
affected by Y2K problems. Another 15 percent is generated by
nuclear reactors _most, of the same design as the Chernobyl nuclear
power plant that exploded in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   That doomsday scenario has been uppermost in the minds of U.S.
officials, as the Department of Energy has worked closely with
Russia's International Science and Technology Center and similar
organizations throughout Europe to bolster Russia's stations.
However, U.S. Embassy officials said the chances of a mishap
``approach zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Likely, they said it will be the day-to-day things that will go
wrong. In a report to the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Year
2000 Technological Problems, special advisor John Beyrle said:
``Russia is likely to experience disruptions in its electrical grid
and telecommunications infrastructure, with subsequent effects on
its financial, industrial and government sectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Power outages in Russia are no joke. As the winter starts,
already more than 20 people have died in Moscow alone from the
cold.
</P>
<P>
   A holdover from the old communist system, all houses are heated
by power stations under the control of municipal authorities.
Following last summer's financial crisis, many of these _
especially in the poorest (and coldest) parts of the country _ have
already run out of money for fuel. A house without heating can
spell death to a rural resident.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the phonelines go dead and the heating is turned off,
the U.S. Embassy in Moscow is well supplied and is unlikely to be
affected directly. It has its own back-up supply of food, power
generators, clean water and satellite telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's major cities are also reasonably well-prepared. Experts
expect only minor problems in Moscow and St. Petersburg, where the
bulk of the country's wealth is concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   With the snow already lying thick on the ground, it is the
people in the countryside that are going to suffer the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's new?'' says Teralink Technologies' Lewin. ``It is Y2K
every day in Siberia.''

CMGI SHARES IN VENTURE FUNDS' PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES M. STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CMGI chief shares in venture funds' profits
</P>
<P>
   We've seen it all before when it comes to money and the leaders
of high-flying Internet companies: modest salaries, but
mind-bending stock interests.
</P>
<P>
   David Wetherell fits the profile and then some as the chief
executive at one of the Web's most successful companies, CMGI Inc.
of Andover, Mass. Paid only $558,000 in cash and perks for the last
fiscal year, he owns company stock that was worth about $2.2
billion as of Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all. Wetherell also is compensated in the fashion
of venture capitalists. The additional payoff already has run into
the hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell and a small group of other executives are rewarded as
managers of venture capital funds that until recently counted CMGI
as their sole investor. Their take: 20 to 22.5 percent of the
profits, roughly 8 percent going to Wetherell personally.
</P>
<P>
   That adds up to real money when you talk about a Web venture
capital portfolio as successful as the (at)Ventures funds. Stock
allocated to Wetherell in just CMGI's last fiscal year, which ended
on July 31, was worth about $166 million Thursday by our count.
Details of the allocations were contained in proxy material filed
by the company this week.
</P>
<P>
   The profit-sharing arrangement has existed since the first
Internet investment and development entity was formed in 1995. But
as those investments mature and subsequent venture portfolios go to
work, the executives' take has become increasingly lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   A second fund, (at)Ventures II, was created in 1996 and also
counted CMGI as its sole financial backer. A third fund launched
this year brought in outside investors for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI managers point out that a 20 percent slice of profits is
standard for general partners in the venture capital world. Some
venture portfolios aimed directly at Internet companies formed in
the last year have jacked up the fee to as much as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And, they say, longstanding CMGI investors who owned shares
worth 126 1/16 each Thursday have prospered on an almost
unimaginable scale as the venture portfolio has blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to go back and look at the institutional investors
that came into CMGI at the time of the initial public offering in
1994 (for about 30 cents a share, adjusting for splits), the
capital appreciation is pretty extraordinary,'' said Andrew
Hajducky III, the company's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure there's any other company around that has seen
that type of appreciation and the reason for the success is the
vision of David Wetherell,'' said Hajducky, who reaps smaller
profit-sharing awards from the same venture vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell and other executives who share in the venture profits
are typically allocated securities when a portfolio company is sold
or CMGI reduces its interest in an investment.
</P>
<P>
   No investment has panned out for CMGI like the $2 million it
sunk into Lycos Inc. years ago. Over time, the company's interest
in Lycos has generated more than $1 billion in value, though it
owns only about 16 percent of its stock now.
</P>
<P>
   The (at)Ventures portfolio allocated Lycos stock to its managers
in September of 1998 as the latest installment of their profit
share. The 793,928 split-adjusted Lycos shares allocated to
Wetherell, worth $12.9 million at the time, are worth about $43
million now.
</P>
<P>
   Other profit-sharing stock allocations often take place when a
venture portfolio company is sold. Wetherell was allotted more than
77,000 shares of Amazon.com when that company bought Sage
Enterprise Inc., a portfolio investment, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the big venture payout of the last year revolved around the
acquisition of GeoCities by Yahoo Inc. in a stock swap. A series of
allocations of Yahoo stock to Wetherell in July, worth more than
$74 million, has appreciated to about $116 million.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what Wetherell and other executives have done with
stock once it has been allocated. In most cases, only a portion
actually is distributed to the executives right away. Their right
to the rest of the stock will vest over time.
</P>
<P>
   The venture profit-sharing payoffs of the future are likely to
be staggering as well. More (at)Ventures investment money is being
put to work than ever and CMGI now has venture interests in dozens
of companies, many of which have gone public this year or plan to
do so soon.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: a maturing market and lots more venture capital
competition in the Internet business. But, as Hajducky points out,
few have the Web investing experience of CMGI's managers.

CONGRESSMEN DEAL HARD FOR LAST-MINUTE SPECIAL-PROJECT CASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The stampede in Congress to fund pet projects with
taxpayer money could have trampled efforts by two Massachusetts
lawmakers to secure $1 million to honor Dr. Seuss.
</P>
<P>
   There are only so many millions to go around, after all.
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Representative Richard E.
Neal, a Springfield Democrat, were undeterred, launching the
back-room ritual of pork-barrel politics that all but determines
whether a lawmaker goes home flush with special-project dollars or
empty handed.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a free-for-all that ended with a smorgasbord of special
money for Massachusetts _ from $500,000 for a Boys and Girls Club
in Chelsea to $197 million for military helicopters whose engines
are built in Lynn _ Kennedy and Neal privately pitched their case
to the top-ranking Democrats and Republicans on the powerful
appropriations committees that dole out billions of dollars in
largesse for projects that no federal agency has requested.
</P>
<P>
   The special projects are called earmarks, and Massachusetts
lawmakers secured more than $760 million worth in the budget for
the current fiscal year, according to a Globe review of the 13
spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed the final five spending bills Thursday. The
Senate was scheduled to begin debating the package Friday, and
President Clinton is expected to sign the measure into law after he
returns from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Massachusetts earmarks will go directly to private
entities, such as Boston College ($500,000), Assumption College
($500,000), the Children's Museum of Boston ($250,000), and the New
England Aquarium ($250,000).
</P>
<P>
   Neal, whose bid for Seuss money failed a year ago, scored a
partial victory this year with an assist from Kennedy. Tucked into
the massive budget for the Department of Housing and Urban
Development is a $400,000 provision to help build a bronze memorial
to Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, in the
author's hometown of Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Neal said he expects to secure an additional $600,000 next year
for the project.
</P>
<P>
   Triumphant, Kennedy and Neal included a Seussian poem in a news
release about the funding that ends:
</P>
<P>
   ``But, most of all, our whole fam
</P>
<P>
   Loves to read Green Eggs and Ham
</P>
<P>
   And so, in honor of Springfield's wonderful writing man
</P>
<P>
   We're proud of this grant from Uncle Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   The way taxpayer groups and critics in Congress view the special
grant, the Seuss classic should be renamed ``Green Eggs and Pork.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that really necessary?'' said Representative Jack Kingston,
a Georgia Republican, when he took to the House floor to deride the
Seuss grant.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the new budget includes thousands of earmarks, more
than enough for all 535 members of Congress. A sampling: $350,000
for a Girl Scouts council in Randolph, N.J.; $250,000 for the
Memphis Zoo; $50,000 for the Black World History Wax Museum in St.
Louis; $10,000 to build an archway in Los Angeles's Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, the new budget includes $1.8 million to renovate
the Bates Mill in Lewiston, Maine; $900,000 to rehabilitate the
Providence Performing Arts Center; $500,000 for the Mark Twain
Visitor's Center in Hartford; $375,000 to tear down an old tannery
in Winchester, N.H.; and $200,000 to renovate an opera house in
Vergennes, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of earmarks defies the policy of fiscal constraint
that leaders of both parties have tried to claim as their own.
Republican leaders made way for the extras even as they agreed with
Clinton to reduce federal spending across the board by 0.38
percent, or $1.3 billion, to stay within balanced-budget caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a spending spree mentality at work,'' said Jim Campi,
a spokesman for Citizens Against Government Waste. The watchdog
group estimates the new spending bills will far surpass the
previous record of $14.5 billion in such projects, set in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The political beneficiaries of the special funds take exception
to the pork label. Massachusetts lawmakers say much of the money,
particularly for defense projects, creates jobs and enriches the
state's economy. Though some in the Bay State delegation privately
ridicule pet projects in other districts, they defend their
earmarks as vital to their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not pork,'' Representative James P. McGovern, a Worcester
Democrat, is fond of saying. ``It's nourishment.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes getting your share is an art form. ``It's an ever
moving feast of how you go about this,'' said Representative John
W. Olver, an Amherst Democrat who is the only Massachusetts
lawmaker who serves on an appropriations committee in Congress.
``You use every mechanism you can,'' said Olver, the top Democrat
on the House panel that controls spending for military
construction.
</P>
<P>
   In the Seuss case, Neal and Kennedy supplemented their personal
appeals by peppering the appropriations committees with news clips
about the campaign to build the memorial, which is led by former
first lady Barbara Bush. The Springfield Library and Museums
Association asked Neal and Kennedy to secure the federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   Neal and Kennedy noted that Congress this year passed a
GOP-sponsored resolution calling ``for every child in every
American community to celebrate and extoll the virtue of reading on
the birthday of America's favorite doctor _ Dr. Seuss.'' Geisel's
birthday was March 2. He died in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Neal also reminded the committees that the US Postal
Service this year issued a stamp commemorating Dr. Seuss. And what
better place to honor Seuss, they argued, than in Springfield,
where Geisel drew inspiration for many of his characters as he
walked down Mulberry Street and through the city zoo.
</P>
<P>
   A breakthrough occurred last month when House and Senate
negotiators agreed behind closed doors to stuff $240 million in
pet-project money into the HUD budget as community development
block grants. In classic, back-room fashion, the House and Senate
split the $240 million evenly, allocating 60 percent in each
chamber to the Republican majority and 40 percent to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The spoils are customarily parceled out by party leaders in
concert with top members of the appropriations panels. Party
leaders receive top consideration, followed by committee chairmen,
lawmakers who are considered vulnerable in the next election, and
rank-and-file members.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 520 earmarks were stashed in the block grant program,
including the Seuss money and eight other Massachusetts projects.
Among the others was $500,000 to redevelop Tremont Street in Boston
near Suffolk University, a priority of the school's alumnus,
Representative J. Joseph Moakley, a South Boston Democrat. There
also was $500,000 to help Assumption College in Worcester build a
science center named for Kennedy's late brother, Joseph P. Kennedy
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many grant requests went unfulfilled in all the spending
bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're buffeted on all sides,'' said Olver, who was criticized
several months ago by Moakley for not fighting hard enough for
Massachusetts interests. ``We are hit by five times as much as we
can actually do.''
</P>
<P>
   Olver suggested Moakley does not need his help because Moakley
wields enormous clout as the top Democrat on the House Rules
Committee and as the dean of the New England delegation, with 26
years of House seniority.
</P>
<P>
   In transportation earmarks, for example, Olver's and McGovern's
districts fared well because Olver ranks second on the panel that
controls transportation spending and McGovern serves on the
transportation committee that recommends the spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGovern had the most transportation earmarks and I had the
second-highest value of them,'' Olver said. ``But for all I know,
Joe Moakley may have been higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Moakley far outstripped the two by securing $54 million
for a transitway between South Station and the South Boston piers.
</P>
<P>
   Olver said he often trades favors on behalf of his Massachusetts
colleagues, as he did with another appropriations member to help
Representative William D. Delahunt, a Quincy Democrat, obtain $12.5
million to help the Massachusetts Maritime Academy replace its
decertified training ship.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Kennedy trades on 37 years of experience and his
seniority on several committees, most notably health and education,
and armed services. He and Senator John F. Kerry, a senior member
of the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, often find
money for Massachusetts outside the earmark process, as they did
recently in obtaining $252 million for the state's teaching
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But even Kennedy sometimes falls short. So it is that
Springfield will have to wait at least another year for the balance
of the money for the Seuss memorial.

`WORLD' IS NOT ENOUGH TO SATISFY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH 
Directed by: Michael Apted 
Screenplay by: Neal Purvis &AMP; Robert Wade, Bruce Feirstein 
Starring: Pierce Brosnan, Sophie Marceau, Robert Carlyle, Denise
Richards, Robbie Coltrane, Judi Dench, Desmond Llewelyn, John
Cleese, Maria Grazia Cucinotta, Samantha Bond 
Running time: 118 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (intense sequences of action violence, some sexuality
and innuendo) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Explosions can take you only so far, even if your name is Bond,
James Bond. There are plenty of explosions in ``The World Is Not
Enough,'' but they don't take the new Bond movie far enough. The
film is kept afloat by its stylistic flourishes, word play, and
mountingly outrageous sexual double entendres. These of course are
like puns in that they're not really much fun unless they are
outrageous. I only wish the plot were more outrageous. After a
terrific prologue, one of the series' best, involving a speedboat
chase along the London docks that ends in a balloon chase, ``The
World Is Not Enough'' settles into some energetic but mundane stuff
involving Robert Carlyle's bad guy marrying a nuclear warhead to an
oil pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that Pierce Brosnan is keenly aware that he's not
supposed to act much as Bond. In fact, the success of Bond films
depends on Bond's underplaying in the face of all the over-the-top
preposterousness erupting around him. Brosnan wears his clothes
beautifully _ no small part of his task. And I wish I knew the name
of the secret wonder fabric of which his Savile Row suits are made.
They take a licking, but never are they creased or stained. The
most amusing thing in the new film is a small detail, but a
perfect, crystallizing one. It comes when Bond's super-duper
speedboat takes a dive and, while underwater, Brosnan adjusts the
knot in Bond's tie as the boat pushes through the watery depths.
</P>
<P>
   Brosnan strikes me as Bond Lite, but he's got the style and he's
fun to watch as he keeps the lid on while everything around him
conspires to blow it off. It's not for nothing that Bond has
centered the big screen's longest-running comic book through 19
films and nearly four decades, accessorizing women and playing
straight man to a string of bad guys. Carlyle's heavy, yet another
renegade Russian terrorist, is nowhere near the requisite
larger-than-life preposterousness, not even when he suggestively
inserts the golden shaft that is the nuclear warhead into a
dangerous cylindrical receptacle. Nor is Sophie Marceau able to go
far as the heiress whose pipeline he's threatening to blow up,
although in fairness to her it must be said that she's locked into
some pretty cliched Eurobabe moves. Unlike ``Goldeneye,'' the first
Brosnan excursion into Bondiana, ``The World Is Not Enough'' seems
less an extension of the Bond series than a recycling of it.
</P>
<P>
   The gadgets are pretty good _ especially in a paraglider attack
against Bond on skis and a dangling buzzsaw carried by a helicopter
_ although series fixture Desmond Llewelyn's Q is talking about
retirement, with John Cleese introduced to bring a Pythonesque
touch to the weapons shop. Judi Dench's M, Bond's boss, for once
leaves the office and is drawn into the plot more actively than
usual. And spunky-voluptuous Starship Trooper Denise Richards
unleashes plenty of bounce as a stateside nuclear scientist and the
latest Bond girl. You'll marvel at her ability to refrain from
groaning at her closing lines. This 19th Bond installment is
passable, but only just. The series is showing its age, although it
just may be that Brosnan already gave us his James Bond film for
the year in the remake of ``The Thomas Crown Affair.'' In this era
of downsizing, it's a relief to report that there's no cutback in
the lavishness of scale and variety of locations we have come to
expect. But the script is not enough in ``The World Is Not
Enough.''

SPRINGSTEEN POINT BLANK 
By Christopher Sandford 
Da Capo Press, 446 pp., $18 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce Springsteen has become the Paul Bunyan of rock 'n' roll.
His legend grows every time he picks up a guitar or gives money to
a food bank, or wins a Grammy or an Oscar or just about anything
else in sight. He's the Jersey Shore kid who made good, though he's
also a complex man who was nagged by self-doubt and poverty for
years before his dreams bore fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Sandford's new biography, ``Springsteen Point
Blank,'' is a loving yet unflinching portrait of a man who was a C
and D student in Catholic schools growing up, but has since become
a rock poet often compared with Bob Dylan. The young Springsteen
was ``a hybrid god who sounded like Elvis casually colluding with
Dylan in an echo chamber,'' writes Sandford, an articulate Briton
who has done books on Mick Jagger, Kurt Cobain, Sting, and David
Bowie.
</P>
<P>
   Sandford did not gain access to Springsteen (few media types do,
because of his tenacious love of privacy), but he still compiled a
deft account based on exhaustive research and interviews with
Springsteen friends and observers from Elvis Costello to Pete
Seeger, and from Norman Mailer to ``perennial presidential hopeful
Bill Bradley,'' a Springsteen friend for many years.
</P>
<P>
   The author does a fine job of exploring the Springsteen myth,
and the reality behind it. He gives Springsteen full credit for
paying dues to become a concert attraction second to none _ and a
painstaking craftsman who thought nothing of scrawling 20 drafts of
a song, or doing three-hour sound checks before a show began.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real Springsteen was, at heart, an ordinary man who
happened to have the gift of seeming both a best friend and an
effigy,'' writes Sandford. ``He loved his wife, baseball and
burgers. He could be cheerfully crude after the second beer. But he
also felt an obligation to play _ to give something back, beyond
the coy, call-and-response japes of the megabands.''
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen grew up poor in Freehold, N.J., where his father,
Doug, had a ``failed career in the rug mill and the plastics
factory,'' the author writes. It was Springsteen's battles with his
father that shaped his music. A tempestuous sort, Doug once threw a
beer can at his son during an argument and nearly beaned him. But
at age 14, Springsteen got his first Fender guitar, played it up to
six hours a day, and thus found an outlet and an escape from
tensions at school and at home.
</P>
<P>
   Although record labels initially took a dim view of Springsteen
(``The loon-panted moguls reserved their loftiest contempt for
Jersey greasers,'' writes Sandford), Springsteen played endless
gigs around the Jersey Shore until he got their attention. But his
early albums sold poorly, and it didn't help that he signed a deal
``on a car roof in an unlit parking lot'' with first manager Mike
Appel, portrayed as ``part grunt and part guru.'' Springsteen later
had to go to court in a messy fight to unseat Appel when new
manager Jon Landau arrived on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen's music eventually became larger than life _ his
``Born in the USA'' album sold 12 million copies _ but Sandford
also looks at the insecurities behind the scenes. He says that
Springsteen's self-doubts made him frequently seek out the sympathy
of groupies. He had a ``gladiatorial sex life'' featuring ``dozens
of women who filled out the time between gigs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late '80s, Springsteen's first marriage, to model
Julianne Phillips, flopped (a 1989 divorce settlement brought her
$20 million), but his second, to backup singer Patti Scialfa, has
lasted through three children. Springsteen is said to be an
excellent father who can ``play-act or read Dr. Seuss by heart''
and who has coached his son Evan's Little League team.
</P>
<P>
   The book is most compelling, however, in its description of how
Springsteen's social conscience grew as he matured. The kid who
hardly read anything became an expert on Flannery O'Connor and John
Steinbeck, among other authors, as his experience of the world
widened. And Springsteen put his money where his heart was. He gave
thousands of dollars to food banks ($35,000 in Dallas alone, during
one tour stop), to miners' wives, to Amnesty International, and
even $100,000 anonymously to help an Arizona club owner cope with
the bills for his cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   He became a man who ``flatly contradicted the conventional
wisdom of a star utterly in thrall to PR,'' writes Sandford.
``Springsteen cared.'' The book's narrative ends late last year _
before Springsteen's recent reunion tour with the E Street Band _
but it's a worthy analysis of rock's most generous soul and, at
long last, family man. This book makes one realize Springsteen
deserves any peace he has found.

EAGLES SEEK REVENGE AT SOUTH BEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He smoldered with intensity. You could see it in his
eyes, and you could hear it in his voice in the way he tersely
spoke about Boston College's nonconference game Saturday at Notre
Dame.
</P>
<P>
   The way Chris Hovan sounded and acted gave you the distinct
impression the BC senior defensive tackle was ready to play the
game in the Conte Forum parking lot, right then and there in his
streetclothes.
</P>
<P>
   With no war paint, no helmet, and no pads.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, Hovan and his teammates have burned with the
desire to avenge last year's 31-26 loss against Notre Dame, one in
which the Eagles were thrwarted from pulling out an amazing
comeback when the Fighting Irish held their ground in a
fourth-and-goal stand at the 1. BC was dealt what coach Tom O'Brien
called ``the hardest loss I've ever been associated with,'' when
Deke Cooper dropped Mike Cloud for a 1-yard loss on the game's last
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I mean, what was it? That much?'' Hovan said,
holding his index fingers about a foot apart. ``That much we lost
to Notre Dame by? That has been eating at me for 365 days, since
training to the offseason, through the summer, because everything I
do I think about that game.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone needed a reminder of the distance that separated BC
from victory last year, junior fullback Ryan Burch was only too
happy to oblige after spring practice when he circulated
photocopies of a picture of that eventful fourth-down play. In it,
both teams are hunkered down in their stances, with BC looking to
punch it in and the Irish clinging to what little turf they had
left to defend.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the photo, a caption read: ``HOW HARD ARE YOU GOING TO
WORK THIS SUMMER?''
</P>
<P>
   Hovan made copies and posted one above his dorm room bed and in
his locker. It motivated Hovan and rest of his teammates to work
that much harder throughout offseason workouts, spring practice,
and preseason camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I see that, it strikes a chord,'' Hovan said. ``I'm
going to bring it and put it in my locker at Notre Dame, I want to
see it right before I go out on the field. It's above my bed in my
room. It's above my locker right now, so I see it everywhere. It's
in my mind. That mental image is in my mind when I practice, before
each play. If I'm getting down at practice and I need something to
get me up, I just think of that.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Eagles improved to 7-2 overall and 4-2 in Big East
play with a stirring 34-17 conference victory over West Virginia,
the memory of BC's stinging setback to Notre Dame was dredged up
when more photocopies were circulated and posted in the locker
room. This time, the caption read: ``HOW HARD ARE YOU GOING TO WORK
THIS WEEK?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think when you walked in and saw `How hard are you
going to work this week?' it was one of those things where
everyone's waited all year to talk about,'' said junior quarterback
Tim Hasselbeck. ``When you're playing games early in the season,
you want to say, `Yeah, down the road we're playing Notre Dame,'
but you can't say that. You don't want to say that when you're
playing somebody else that week. Now this is the time we can start
talking about this game and how excited we are for this game and
how we've been waiting a year to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know how to describe it,'' he added, ``But when
you saw that picture in the locker room _ `How hard are you going
to work this week?' _ it was like, `Yeah, this week has finally
come.' You don't have to wait anymore. You don't have think about
it anymore and not talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Eagles are focused on avenging that loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played them toe-to-toe,'' Hovan said. ``When Notre Dame
left this place, they know they left _ barely.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame coach Bob Davie was not one to argue the point. He
knew how fortunate his team was to escape Alumni Stadium with a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I couldn't help but think what Boston College felt like as
well,'' Davie said. ``It was kind of like, you know, our game at
Pittsburgh the other night. I was about as low as I have ever been
in coaching, being from Pittsburgh and having coached at Pittsburgh
and having family there and all those things, but I couldn't help
but appreciate what it did for Walt Harris and for Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it was kind of the same thing last year at Boston
College,'' he added. ``I felt fortunate we won. Obviously, I was
elated for our football team, but I couldn't help but think what
Tom and those guys probably felt like when they had gone down and
had that football game won in a great comeback and then have it
snatched away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Davie's words of consolation seemed to come too little and too
late for the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words can't describe how long I've been waiting for this game
and how I can't wait to get to South Bend and play there,'' Hovan
said. ``It's been on everybody's mind and we've got that picture.
It says, `How hard are you going to work this week?' on it. That
picture is everywhere, so everyone sees how hard they do have to
work this week to win that game.''

NBC PICKS A POOR TIME FOR `Y2K' MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Y2K: The Movie'' is as exciting and plausible as it is
irresponsible. The NBC movie (Sunday at 9 p.m. Eastern) ominously
asks the question of the millennium in its promotion: ``What if
they're right?''
</P>
<P>
   What if all hell breaks loose after midnight on New Year's Eve?
The answer: Bad things. Really bad things. Power grids, nuke
plants, airlines, prisons, hospital monitors, the coffeemaker (now,
that hurts) and, of course, the nutty neighbor all are going to
wack out. There will be widespread panic amid the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Olin, as ``complex systems failure expert'' Nick Cromwell,
plays the angst-ridden hero better than he has since
``thirtysomething.'' And the various Y2K scenarios that erupt as
midnight clicks over across the globe (hint: Stay away from Sweden
on New Year's Eve) seem believable, despite repeated assurances
from real-life institutions that their operations are compliant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K: The Movie'' throws out more statistics than an NFL
commentator as a way of building plausibility. One annoying tactic
employed has characters give dissertations on subjects to people
who already fully know what is being explained. If I were the
nuclear power plant manager who had to listen to a computer geek
tell him what happens in a meltdown, I would d bash him over the
head with a plutonium fuel rod.
</P>
<P>
   But by television standards, this is a surprisingly good movie,
one that could accomplish the goal of all ``art'': have impact. And
therein lies the dilemma. With one of the primary concerns
officials have regarding Y2K ramifications being potential panic
based on baseless emotion, this is not he most opportune time to
air the movie _ unless, of course, you consider that it's sweeps
month.
</P>
<P>
   The movie does begin with a warning: ``This program is a purely
fictional thriller. The characters and situations are not based on
fact. This program does not suggest or imply hat any of these
events could actually occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Sight-unseen, various groups have come out blasting the timing
of the film, calling on NBC news divisions to prevent public panic.
</P>
<P>
   D-Day for any potential Y2K computer issues is coming, ``but at
a time that the leaders are telling us the biggest remaining
problem is panic,'' said Dick Mills, a computer programmer and
founder of the Capital District Y2K Interest Group in Albany, N.Y.
``It is very irresponsible to be doing this at this particular
time. In terms of poor taste, I'd compare it to making a
made-for-TV movie about a massacre in a high school cafeteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, we put too much emphasis on the entertainment industry
to be a responsible moral compass, a duty it is woefully unequipped
to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Does too much violence on television and in the movies beget
violence? To a point. Does a relaxation of mores in film lead to a
corresponding change in sexual and societal attitudes? Maybe. But
ultimately the responsibility for the actions of ourselves and our
children rests with us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K: The Movie'' could have a very immediate and adverse
impact on at least the segment of the public that is suspicious of
its leaders to start with, and may not be buying the assurances
that most, if not all, is well.
</P>
<P>
   Had this movie come out during the February or May sweeps, there
would be no problem. But now time is short, the clock is ticking,
and some of us could worry that there will be no Nick Cromwell to
save the day. Or millennium.

CONGRESSMEN DEAL HARD FOR LAST-MINUTE SPECIAL-PROJECT CASH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The stampede in Congress to fund pet projects with
taxpayer money could have trampled efforts by two Massachusetts
lawmakers to secure $1 million to honor Dr. Seuss.
</P>
<P>
   There are only so many millions to go around, after all.
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Representative Richard E.
Neal, a Springfield Democrat, were undeterred, launching the
back-room ritual of pork-barrel politics that all but determines
whether a lawmaker goes home flush with special-project dollars or
empty handed.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a free-for-all that ended with a smorgasbord of special
money for Massachusetts _ from $500,000 for a Boys and Girls Club
in Chelsea to $197 million for military helicopters whose engines
are built in Lynn _ Kennedy and Neal privately pitched their case
to the top-ranking Democrats and Republicans on the powerful
appropriations committees that dole out billions of dollars in
largesse for projects that no federal agency has requested.
</P>
<P>
   The special projects are called earmarks, and Massachusetts
lawmakers secured more than $760 million worth in the budget for
the current fiscal year, according to a Globe review of the 13
spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed the final five spending bills Thursday. The
Senate was scheduled to begin debating the package Friday, and
President Clinton is expected to sign the measure into law after he
returns from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Massachusetts earmarks will go directly to private
entities, such as Boston College ($500,000), Assumption College
($500,000), the Children's Museum of Boston ($250,000), and the New
England Aquarium ($250,000).
</P>
<P>
   Neal, whose bid for Seuss money failed a year ago, scored a
partial victory this year with an assist from Kennedy. Tucked into
the massive budget for the Department of Housing and Urban
Development is a $400,000 provision to help build a bronze memorial
to Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, in the
author's hometown of Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Neal said he expects to secure an additional $600,000 next year
for the project.
</P>
<P>
   Triumphant, Kennedy and Neal included a Seussian poem in a news
release about the funding that ends:
</P>
<P>
   ``But, most of all, our whole fam
</P>
<P>
   Loves to read Green Eggs and Ham
</P>
<P>
   And so, in honor of Springfield's wonderful writing man
</P>
<P>
   We're proud of this grant from Uncle Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   The way taxpayer groups and critics in Congress view the special
grant, the Seuss classic should be renamed ``Green Eggs and Pork.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that really necessary?'' said Representative Jack Kingston,
a Georgia Republican, when he took to the House floor to deride the
Seuss grant.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the new budget includes thousands of earmarks, more
than enough for all 535 members of Congress. A sampling: $350,000
for a Girl Scouts council in Randolph, N.J.; $250,000 for the
Memphis Zoo; $50,000 for the Black World History Wax Museum in St.
Louis; $10,000 to build an archway in Los Angeles's Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, the new budget includes $1.8 million to renovate
the Bates Mill in Lewiston, Maine; $900,000 to rehabilitate the
Providence Performing Arts Center; $500,000 for the Mark Twain
Visitor's Center in Hartford; $375,000 to tear down an old tannery
in Winchester, N.H.; and $200,000 to renovate an opera house in
Vergennes, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of earmarks defies the policy of fiscal constraint
that leaders of both parties have tried to claim as their own.
Republican leaders made way for the extras even as they agreed with
Clinton to reduce federal spending across the board by 0.38
percent, or $1.3 billion, to stay within balanced-budget caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a spending spree mentality at work,'' said Jim Campi,
a spokesman for Citizens Against Government Waste. The watchdog
group estimates the new spending bills will far surpass the
previous record of $14.5 billion in such projects, set in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The political beneficiaries of the special funds take exception
to the pork label. Massachusetts lawmakers say much of the money,
particularly for defense projects, creates jobs and enriches the
state's economy. Though some in the Bay State delegation privately
ridicule pet projects in other districts, they defend their
earmarks as vital to their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not pork,'' Representative James P. McGovern, a Worcester
Democrat, is fond of saying. ``It's nourishment.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes getting your share is an art form. ``It's an ever
moving feast of how you go about this,'' said Representative John
W. Olver, an Amherst Democrat who is the only Massachusetts
lawmaker who serves on an appropriations committee in Congress.
``You use every mechanism you can,'' said Olver, the top Democrat
on the House panel that controls spending for military
construction.
</P>
<P>
   In the Seuss case, Neal and Kennedy supplemented their personal
appeals by peppering the appropriations committees with news clips
about the campaign to build the memorial, which is led by former
first lady Barbara Bush. The Springfield Library and Museums
Association asked Neal and Kennedy to secure the federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   Neal and Kennedy noted that Congress this year passed a
GOP-sponsored resolution calling ``for every child in every
American community to celebrate and extoll the virtue of reading on
the birthday of America's favorite doctor _ Dr. Seuss.'' Geisel's
birthday was March 2. He died in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Neal also reminded the committees that the US Postal
Service this year issued a stamp commemorating Dr. Seuss. And what
better place to honor Seuss, they argued, than in Springfield,
where Geisel drew inspiration for many of his characters as he
walked down Mulberry Street and through the city zoo.
</P>
<P>
   A breakthrough occurred last month when House and Senate
negotiators agreed behind closed doors to stuff $240 million in
pet-project money into the HUD budget as community development
block grants. In classic, back-room fashion, the House and Senate
split the $240 million evenly, allocating 60 percent in each
chamber to the Republican majority and 40 percent to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The spoils are customarily parceled out by party leaders in
concert with top members of the appropriations panels. Party
leaders receive top consideration, followed by committee chairmen,
lawmakers who are considered vulnerable in the next election, and
rank-and-file members.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 520 earmarks were stashed in the block grant program,
including the Seuss money and eight other Massachusetts projects.
Among the others was $500,000 to redevelop Tremont Street in Boston
near Suffolk University, a priority of the school's alumnus,
Representative J. Joseph Moakley, a South Boston Democrat. There
also was $500,000 to help Assumption College in Worcester build a
science center named for Kennedy's late brother, Joseph P. Kennedy
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many grant requests went unfulfilled in all the spending
bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're buffeted on all sides,'' said Olver, who was criticized
several months ago by Moakley for not fighting hard enough for
Massachusetts interests. ``We are hit by five times as much as we
can actually do.''
</P>
<P>
   Olver suggested Moakley does not need his help because Moakley
wields enormous clout as the top Democrat on the House Rules
Committee and as the dean of the New England delegation, with 26
years of House seniority.
</P>
<P>
   In transportation earmarks, for example, Olver's and McGovern's
districts fared well because Olver ranks second on the panel that
controls transportation spending and McGovern serves on the
transportation committee that recommends the spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGovern had the most transportation earmarks and I had the
second-highest value of them,'' Olver said. ``But for all I know,
Joe Moakley may have been higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Moakley far outstripped the two by securing $54 million
for a transitway between South Station and the South Boston piers.
</P>
<P>
   Olver said he often trades favors on behalf of his Massachusetts
colleagues, as he did with another appropriations member to help
Representative William D. Delahunt, a Quincy Democrat, obtain $12.5
million to help the Massachusetts Maritime Academy replace its
decertified training ship.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Kennedy trades on 37 years of experience and his
seniority on several committees, most notably health and education,
and armed services. He and Senator John F. Kerry, a senior member
of the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, often find
money for Massachusetts outside the earmark process, as they did
recently in obtaining $252 million for the state's teaching
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But even Kennedy sometimes falls short. So it is that
Springfield will have to wait at least another year for the balance
of the money for the Seuss memorial.

A REDEMPTION SONG IN TWO-PART DISHARMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ This was their grand forum for asserting
supremacy once and for all in the helter-skelter AFC East. They'd
practiced to a fever pitch. A divisional archrival, but one they
figured to be capable of handling, stood on the opposite sideline
as the ideal foil. A large network television audience was tuned in
to witness their exhibition of might. And most important, first
place was at stake along with Nielsen ratings.
</P>
<P>
   But they proceeded to unravel like a threadbare camera cable.
Futility would have represented progress for their offense. Their
defense couldn't even play tag with the mobile quarterback on the
other side of the line. In truth, they didn't force that
quarterback to do much, anyway, because they were perhaps even more
inept against the running game, which carved canyons through their
front. Afterward, their stricken coach was reduced to virtual
speechlessness that was a thin veneer for his rage. And they
transformed the rest of their schedule into an obstacle course
rather than a coronation parade.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, those Miami Dolphins sure were awful.
</P>
<P>
   What's that? Say again? Oh, you thought the New England Patriots
were the offending party in question. Well, yes, them, too.
</P>
<P>
   But as embarrassed as the Patriots were in their 24-17 ``Monday
Night Football'' fiasco against the New York Jets, the Dolphins may
have surpassed them on the humiliation meter with their 23-3 loss
at Buffalo in CBS's prime Sunday afternoon game.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the teams will have twin objectives when they meet
in Miami this Sunday: trying to stay afloat in the division and
purging the previous week's abomination from their systems. The
Dolphins (7-2) fell into a first-place tie with the Indianapolis
Colts, while the Patriots (6-3) squandered a premium opportunity to
divide the pie in three and plunged into fourth place, just behind
the Bills (7-3). Thus, they have unwittingly, unwillingly turned
Sunday's rematch into what New England linebacker Chris Slade
called ``a must-win game. You hate to use that term so early, but
that's what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was a difference in the impact of last week's ambushes,
it was in degrees of disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Having just been toyed with by a quarterback who couldn't make
his practice squad as a receiver two years ago, Ray Lucas (18 for
31, 153 yards, 2 touchdowns, 2 interceptions, no sacks); plundered
by a running back who had abandoned him last year, Curtis Martin
(31 carries, 149 yards, 36-yard TD); and still unable to shed the
curse of That Man, Bill Parcells, and his cellar-dwelling Jets,
Patriots coach Pete Caroll was uncharacteristically abrupt in his
postgame summation. He concluded his clipped comments with this
epitaph: ``We stunk out the joint.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a study in verbosity compared to Miami coach Jimmy
Johnson the day before. After watching his offense roll up 101
yards, the second-lowest total in franchise history, while his
defense was being sundered by Antowain Smith (29 carries, 126
yards) and allowing quarterback Doug Flutie (10 for 20, 157 yards,
1 TD, no interceptions, no sacks) time to practice his drumming in
the Bills backfield, Johnson turned his postgame press conference
into a two-minute drill. He also placed a virtual gag order on his
players in terms of discussing the day's crimes and probably would
have ripped out his hair if his hands wouldn't have gotten stuck in
all that gel.
</P>
<P>
   While noting the parallels in the disasters, Carroll
acknowledged that going against a red-faced opponent doesn't make
matters easier, even for a team that also has atonement on its
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're counting on it that they understand just like we
understand the nature of the matchup,'' he said Thursday. ``We also
understand that they had a very similar ballgame to the one we did.
We know how it's affecting us and we know how it will affect them.
It should be a very, very intense football game. Often in the NFL,
you see teams really respond. You see teams bounce back. Generally,
I would rather have a team (the Patriots are about to face) win the
week before.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't the case this time, for simple mathematical reasons,
as offensive lineman Max Lane calculated: ``We're glad they lost.
If they would've won, they would have been two games up on us
instead of one.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll's larger point is that, given the guaranteed stakes,
it's better if the opponent doesn't have its incentive ratcheted up
another notch. And as he said, ``I know Jimmy's going to have them
ready.'' Or else.
</P>
<P>
   While the Patriots may agree with their coach in theory, they
figure no incidental considerations are necessary to command their
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much tougher it can be,'' said offensive
tackle Bruce Armstrong. ``There's a lot at stake for us and them.
We're both coming off performances we're not happy with. But
there's a lot at stake without adding anything to it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to wide receiver Shawn Jefferson, it's not so much the
nature of the losses but the ramifications of the losses: ``We're
both fighting for our playoff lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Chad Easton believes this would be the perfect
time for misery to have plenty of company. He knows what would make
the most enjoyable reading for him in next Monday's paper: ``We
want everyone in the division (except the Jets) to be 7-3.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Carroll and his employees are talking about the same
thing in different ways. The division lead would be an inevitable
byproduct of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most guys in this league are pretty competitive,'' said Lane.
``We both want to respond, show what we can do after a bad game.
We'll see who does it better.''
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't possibly be worse.

THESE GIFTS ARE A SLICE ABOVE THE REST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Everyone knows an Emeril-wannabe. A man or woman
or teen whose favorite room in the house is the kitchen, whose idea
of time well spent is however long it takes to create a five-course
dinner for six ... along with a selection of home-made desserts.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you are lucky enough to live with a person who loves to
cook, because he or she usually enjoys preparing food most of the
time, and not just for dinner parties. Which makes you the
recipient of countless delightful meals ... as fine a station in
life as there is. After all, it would be rude to not savor their
creations, and you know you don't want to be rude.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the only reason you are fortunate, though. You are
also lucky because amateur chefs are among the easiest folks on the
planet for whom to find a gift that is both practical and sure to
please. Plus, you get the added bonus of browsing in a cook's
resource store ... like Different Drummer's Kitchen or
Williams-Sonoma or The Cellar at Macy's ... shops that are as
intriguing as a hands-on museum.
</P>
<P>
   There is one firm guideline for buying gifts for chefs. Keep in
mind that they have limited space in their kitchens, and new
products should not be so large that the cook's first thought is:
Where am I going to store this?
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, we offer five new or relatively new items to
consider for the holidays, covering a fairly wide price range:
</P>
<P>
   _ Global knives. Manufactured in Japan by a company called
Yoshikin, Global knives are new to the U.S. market (though they've
won a half-dozen design awards and were named sharpest knife by a
leading German food magazine).
</P>
<P>
   Woodless, they have a unique look. Constructed of hard stainless
steel, they have no applied handles and the blades are thinner than
typical top-line German or American-made knives. As a result,
Global knives weigh roughly half what the competitors' knives
weigh.
</P>
<P>
   Price: $25 for a four-inch paring knife and $78 for a
one-side-only sharpened Deba-style knife designed for preparing
sushi and sashimi.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wave knife tray. A perfect complement for new knives, the
knife tray will appeal especially to parents who prefer to keep
sharp items in a drawer instead of in a block on the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Made in Dorset, Vt., by the J.K. Adams Co., the Wave knife tray
may seem too attractive to reside out of sight in a drawer. It is
made of New England ash and has an oil finish. It holds five large
kitchen and six steak or paring knives.
</P>
<P>
   Price: $37 at Williams-Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   _ Zyliss cheese grater and gift set. An item the holiday baker
will wish he had prior to making cookies and other treats. In
addition to cheese, it grates nuts and chocolate (using the
optional coarse drum) and comes with a measured dispenser that
attaches to the drum opening, allowing you to grate directly into
the container with measurement markings.
</P>
<P>
   With its adjustable lid, the dispenser doubles as a shaker and
storage container.
</P>
<P>
   Price: $24.99.
</P>
<P>
   _ Misto. The Connecticut-made olive oil sprayer hit the market
with a splash 18 months ago at the Fancy Food Show in New York, and
it continues to be a popular item at gourmet supply stores. The
chrome sprayer is economical (it conserves olive oil), as well as
versatile (ideal for coating frying pans and for spritzing a salad
prior to adding balsamic vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   Price: $19.99. Williams-Sonoma carries its own brand, QuickMist,
for $19, or $15 when on sale.
</P>
<P>
   _Cole &AMP; Mason fresh grind herb and spice mills. A first-rate way
to bring new life to dried herbs such as basil or oregano, these
mills grind as they apply, releasing added flavor. Easily
refillable, they work less well with tougher spices such as fennel
seeds, which you will probably want to crush with a mortar and
pestle or even put in a coffee-bean grinder.
</P>
<P>
   Price: $5.99.

MLS FOES DISCOVERING A NEW GALAXY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Galaxy have been scoring fewer goals _ actually
a lot fewer _ but the team is clearly enjoying life more than it
was a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy converted 85 goals in the 1998 season and only 49
this year. But after failing to advance past the second round of
the '98 playoffs, they have qualified for the '99 MLS Cup final
against D.C. United at Foxboro Stadium Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is calling us a defensive team, but every game we
create chances and that is what it's all about,'' Galaxy coach Sigi
Schmid said Thursday. ``Last year, a lot of guys had career years
on the offensive end and it was unrealistic to expect them to have
years like that again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have six offensive players in our lineup and only four who
think defense first. Defense is very important but defense is an
attitude. If you go forward too much you can expose yourself.
Holding onto the ball is the best defense there is. Making the
other team defend against us, dragging their players into positions
on the field where they don't want to be. That is what Chicago did
to D.C. United last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Chicago knocked out the Galaxy and defeated United in
the final by playing a pragmatic style. The Fire shut down the
midfield service from Mauricio Cienfuegos, stifled the Galaxy's
outside speed, and limited the chances of Carlos Hermosillo.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy have adopted some of the Fire's traits this year.
But, like the Fire, the Galaxy have enough offensive dynamism and
counterattacking ability to present an inspiring game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it seems odd that a team should be perceived as
conservative with players such as Hermosillo, nicknamed ``Senor
Gol,'' the all-time leading scorer in the Mexican national team
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We scored goals last year and didn't get to the final and we
scored a lot less goals this year and did make it to the final,''
Hermosillo said. ``I prefer being on a team that wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this will be Hermosillo's ninth championship match in a
17-year professional career with Mexican powers America, Cruz Azul,
and Necaxa, plus a brief stop in Belgium with Standard Liege.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo produced a spectacular goal on his first visit to
Foxboro Stadium, blocking a Kasey Keller clearance with his head
into the net in the opening seconds as Mexico and the US tied, 2-2,
in a World Cup qualifier April 20, 1997. He has scored 36 goals in
95 internationals _ more than Hugo Sanchez, the most accomplished
goal-scorer in North American history _ and 280 goals in Mexico,
highest total for a Mexican player and second all-time to the
Brazilian Cabinho, who had 314 goals. Hermosillo has announced that
he wants to break Cabinho's record, and he will return to Necaxa's
playoff-bound team next week to renew that campaign.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, Hermosillo hopes to continue what amounts to a
hot streak. He converted three goals in the last two games as the
Galaxy eliminated Dallas, a significant number of goals considering
that Hermosillo had only eight during the regular season, tied with
Cobi Jones for the team lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are playing a different style this year because the coach
is different,'' Hermosillo said. ``I can't say which style is
better, only that we are in the final game. I am really happy to be
with this team and it's been great strengthening my ties with
everyone on the team. I want to break the record in Mexico _ it is
something that is very important in my country _ and I will have to
look at every factor when the time comes for a decision to be
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo, with 19 goals in a season and a half with the
Galaxy, might not set any records in the MLS.
</P>
<P>
   But the Galaxy should be dangerous in attack with a supporting
cast that includes Costa Rican Roy Myers, plus Ezra Hendrickson,
Clint Mathis, Greg Vanney, Cienfuegos, and Jones. The defense, led
by Paul Caligiuri, Robin Fraser, and midfielder Danny Pena, plus
goalkeeper of the year Kevin Hartman, provides security and
skillful distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Five players remain from the Galaxy team that set standards for
excellence during the regular season, then lost, 3-2, to United in
overtime in MLS Cup '96 at Foxboro Stadium. If Senor Gol's scoring
can lead the Galaxy past United, he might acquire another nickname
_ Mr. November.

<P>
   - St. Anthony Falls and the Stone Arch Bridge, 125 S.E. Main St.
(612-627-5433). First there were the falls, the only such geography
on the Mississippi River, then the flour and lumber mills and the
birth of Minneapolis. With the falls eroding, for manmade and
natural reasons, a less-than-picturesque concrete apron was added.
Still picturesque, however, is the 1883 Stone Arch Bridge, which
looks like its name, a curving limestone viaduct spanning the
river.
</P>
<P>
   - Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum, 333 E. River Road
(612-625-9494). Outside it's a jumbled pile of polished stainless

of thing (the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, for instance).
When you're finished staring, go inside to see the excellent
20th-century collection. Free admission.

<P>
   A whole bagful of shopping options
</P>
<P>
   For reasons I can't hope to understand, travelers spend an
unbelievable amount of time shopping. All the tourism surveys say
so. Visitors to the Twin Cities seem particularly smitten, and not
just because of Exhibit No. 1:
</P>
<P>
   - Mall of America. Needs no introduction, really. Travel books
devote entire sections to its 500 or so stores and other
attractions. You might as well count yourself among the 40 million
annual visitors. It's in Bloomington and hard to miss (seven Yankee
Stadiums could fit inside; so could 32 Boeing 747s)
</P>
<P>
   - Nicollet Mall. This is not a suburban shopping mall but a
pedestrian thoroughfare in downtown Minneapolis. Yo have your
Neiman Marcus, your Saks Fifth Avenue, your Dayton's. It's said
there's more shopping in a four-block radius here than in any city
in the country. No Camp Snoopy amusement park like at the Mall, but
it feels very grown up to shop here.
</P>
<P>
   - Uptown. On the map it's actually south of downtown Minneapolis
along Hennepin Avenue. A lively place for strolling, Uptown is
clinging to a little of its funk. Don't let that big ol' Gap store
at Hennepin and Lake scare you away. A couple hundred other shops
offer such things as platform shoes, designer clothes, skateboards,
incense and Indonesian imports.
</P>
<P>
   - 50th and France. Stuff won't be cheap here on the border
between Minneapolis and the suburb of Edina, the area near 50th
Street and France Avenue. But it's really good stuff inside these
boutiques, from classic men's fashions to contemporary jewelry to
unique houseware.
</P>
<P>
   - Grand Avenue. Over in St. Paul, Summit Avenue is the
fashionable residential district for mansion-gawking. Parallel to
Summit is Grand Avenue, where more modest homes have morphed into
shops. Browse the bookstores and antique galleries, then stop at a
quirky spot to eat.
</P>
<P>
   - Southdale. Mall fans might want to visit just to say they've
been here. Opened in 1957, the Edina mall considers itself the
first fully enclosed suburban shopping center in the country.
Across the way is the Galleria, where you may actually find stores
you never heard of before.

PATRIOTS NEVER OUT OF IT, SIMMS SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the last Patriots-Dolphins meeting, Oct. 17, Pete Carroll
told CBS analyst Phil Simms that one of his team's problems is it
allows the opposition to control the tempo of the game.
</P>
<P>
   That's not necessarily a bad thing, especially when Drew Bledsoe
is at the helm and capable of pulling out last-minute heroics. Last
Monday night's game against the New York Jets was a case in point.
``After all is said and done, the Patriots still had chances to win
the game,'' Simms said.
</P>
<P>
   It's definitely frustrating, but despite the team's
inconsistency, the Patriots are still vying for the AFC East lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the incredible thing about the Patriots,'' Simms said.
``They have a home run hitter in Bledsoe. They can't come and
dominate you physically and that's why they will come out in the
beginning of some games and look flat. But in this league, it's all
about the quarterback. The Patriots will always be in close games
as long as Bledsoe is around.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms likes Sunday's matchup between two teams coming off
humiliating losses. ``We got a little anger in this one,'' Simms
said.
</P>
<P>
   Simms and play-by-play announcer Greg Gumbel are in Miami to
call the 1 p.m. game. Neither team can afford to lose because of
the competitiveness of the AFC East. ``This is going to be a great
finish,'' Simms said. ``All the teams are playing each other in the
next four or five weeks and it will be interesting to see which
teams ends up on top.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots play Buffalo twice after the Dolphins game. Simms
said the Patriots are one of those ``sleek and pretty'' teams,
while the Bills are ``big and ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bills try to overwhelm you with their power, which is a
lost art in the NFL these days,'' Simms said. ``It's harder to have
a power game these days. Running the football requires a lot of
patience, dedication, and hard work to succeed. There's nothing
uglier than a running play up the middle. But teams don't like
doing it because they know they can come up with three or four pass
plays which are quicker, easier to practice, and potentially
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms is enamored with Sam Gash, the former Patriots fullback
who now plays for the Bills. During last week's Bills game against
the Dolphins, Buffalo ran the ball at will and simply manhandled
the Dolphins' defensive line. Gash was a big part of it. ``It's not
so much that he is a great blocker,'' Simms said. ``He is just out
there humiliating people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins don't have a dominating player like Gash, but they
did beat the Patriots, 31-30, in Foxborough as Damon Huard stepped
in for an injured Dan Marino.
</P>
<P>
   Simms does not buy into the notion that the Dolphins are better
without Marino, but he is certain of one thing _ Sunday's game will
not be as high-scoring as the first.
</P>
<P>

   Despite a record $2.4 billion television rights deal, NASCAR
received a dose of reality last Saturday when NBC aired the
Pennzoil 400 and received the lowest Winston Cup ratings in the

</P>
<P>
   The race, which attracted about 3 million viewers or a 3 rating,
was the first for NBC, which signed a six-year deal with NASCAR.

at 9:30, followed by the Andrew Golota-Michael Grant bout.
Lewis-Holyfield received 850,000 pay-per-view buys last Saturday
night. HBO officials were happy with the numbers despite the drop
from the first Holyfield-Lewis fight, which received 1.2 million
buys. The second fight between Holyfield and Mike Tyson earned the
most buys in pay-per-view history, 1.9 million . . . Monday night's
game between the Patriots and Jets pulled a 21.3 rating and 39
share . . . Fox 25 has the NFL doubleheader Sunday as Dick Stockton
and Matt Millen call the 1 p.m. game between the Detroit Lions and
Green Bay Packers. Kenny Albert and Tim Green are in the booth for
the New York Giants and Washington Redskins at 4 p.m . . . Lifetime
airs the ``Secret Four in the Fall'' women's college basketball
tournament Saturday from 7-11:30 p.m. The University of North
Carolina plays UCLA in the first game, followed by Louisiana
State-Texas Tech.

THERE ARE PLENTY OF PLACES TO MAKE MERRY IN MINNEAPOLIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDWARD M. EVELD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Two things I had absolutely no trouble finding in
Minneapolis' old Warehouse District: a burger and a television.
Sports bar a-go-go, baby _ a great place to be 25 and hungry for
stats and ground beef.
</P>
<P>
   My goodness, but is this what's left of the Minneapolis scene,
housed in these ancient and mammoth brick buildings, a scene that
was once funky, cutting edge, bohemian; that started in the 1970s
with a few bistros and art galleries; that blossomed into a music
hot spot where ``The Artist Formerly Known As'' filmed ``Purple
Rain''?
</P>
<P>
   Like other river cities, Minneapolis launched industries in the
19th century along its riverfront and backed them up with a warren
of sturdy brick and stone buildings, close to the river, close to
the railroads.
</P>
<P>
   But what to do with these stocky, muscular structures after the
industries closed, the trains stopped and the trucks took to the
interstates? It's a question many American cities, including Kansas
City, have tried to answer.
</P>
<P>
   The Minneapolis district always had great rehab potential
because of its location. It sits alongside an impressive downtown
and stretches toward the Mississippi River. The buildings _ many
restored, others still in waiting _ are magnificent in the way they
evoke the turn of the last century.
</P>
<P>
   Upon my inaugural stroll into the district from my hotel
downtown I couldn't help but notice the plentiful opportunities to
catch a ballgame on TV and down a few brews. The occasional exotic
dance club added ``seedy'' to my first impression.
</P>
<P>
   This is what makes people like Jon Oulman, a longtime gallery
owner in the district, wistful. For years he took his Great Dane
for walks along district streets, where some two dozen galleries
used to hold joint exhibition openings, art happenings that drew
thousands. But most of the galleries have left.
</P>
<P>
   On an August day I dropped by his place, a combination art
gallery and hair salon, and learned that he, too, was leaving.
``Entertainment'' and art don't mix, Oulman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all formula here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I understood Oulman's disappointment in the way the district had
evolved. I recognized the ``Anycity, U.S.A.'' aspect to some of the
establishments, perhaps a predictable result of the city's decision
to locate its sports arena, the Target Center, here.
</P>
<P>
   But I saw something else. I saw people having fun _ downtown.
That's an accomplishment at which other big and middle-sized cities
work hard to achieve and still sometimes fail.
</P>
<P>
   And I found some delightful, non-burger dining spots, with
wonderful urban backdrops. I found interesting music venues,
theaters, coffee shops and antique stores. I saw new town homes
going up within walking distance.
</P>
<P>
   I also decided the sports bars shouldn't take all the blame for
the demise of the galleries. Doug Flanders of Flanders Contemporary
Art said the art market in the Twin Cities was generally anemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never really has caught on,'' said Flanders. He survives
only because of his strong international sales, he said. And
although his gallery is still in the district, he's seriously
scouting a move to New York.
</P>
<P>
   What you see a lot of in the district is converted office space
_ architects, engineers, computer consultants, software companies _
a lot more white collars and polo shirts than berets. But frankly,
how else are you going to fill up all these buildings?
</P>
<P>
   Yet some artists have made a home in the district. I discovered
you can even wander up to their studios and have a chat. The
Traffic Zone Center for the Visual Arts is a co-op in a hulking
building with two dozen studios and several commercial tenants.
</P>
<P>
   I found artist Louise Gillis in No. 316, a high-ceilinged studio
she shares with Lois Rhomberg. Six floor-to-ceiling windows
dominated one wall. Gillis welcomed me and right away showed off
her current painting of an Oriental lily. She told about the great
light in the studio _ and about the location.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll walk down to Moose and Sadies (a coffee shop) and then go
to an antique store to look for objects for painting. And I can
walk to the river from here,'' she said. ``The downtown area is
stimulating. It's a creative atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillis led me to a giant, first-floor space next door where the
high ceilings were being put to good use at a business called
Apropos. Two artists were painting mural-sized works, including a
brilliant, magnified plaid design, for building interiors.
</P>
<P>
   I decided my job in the food department was to find something
for lunch that didn't involve ground beef. Soon enough I came upon
Cafe Brenda, wrapped around a corner and highlighted by windows two
stories tall for great people-watching. And _ aha! _ a menu with
organic and vegetarian offerings.
</P>
<P>
   You could order a patty here, but it would be the veggie, bean
and nut variety. The mock duck tacos are a favorite. Owner Brenda
Langton calls her fare ``comfort gourmet natural food,'' and she
admits your average sports-bar patron might not be interested.
</P>
<P>
   But Langton has been in the Warehouse District for 13 years, and
selling Midwesterners on healthy eating is an ongoing exercise, she
said. She isn't going to let a few sports bars push her around.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be clear here that I like a good burger as much as anyone,
but the anti-burger crusade started to grow on me. An expedition of
sorts.
</P>
<P>
   I heard that a great place for sushi was nearby at Origami
(although I didn't make it there). I did stop in at the New French
Cafe and Bar, the pioneer restaurant in the district, and found it
had new owners as of a year ago, lots of new white paint and a
fine-dining menu.
</P>
<P>
   For dinner, I landed at a table in a large and unprettified
courtyard outside Nikki's Cafe and Bar. This is when I cheated a
bit and ordered Nikki's meat loaf.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just meat loaf, though. It was ``meat loaf en
feuillete,'' with a delicious puff pastry on top. For dessert:
bread pudding with bourbon caramel cream sauce. The combination was
plenty hardy.
</P>
<P>
   Up and walking again soon, I happened upon still more
interesting pockets in the district. One was the House of Balls,
the storefront studio of sculptor Allen Christian, who often isn't
in. Not to worry, though.
</P>
<P>
   I could see his unusual sculpture-assemblies through the window
and took advantage of a series of buttons or ``treasure locators''
that, when pushed, triggered movement on the other side. One turned
a golf ball that was attached to the head of a baby doll sporting a
mohawk. I don't know the explanation for this piece, but it might
be better left unsaid.
</P>
<P>
   A taping system near the door recorded and played visitors'
comments to a question posed on a chalkboard: ``Do all worlds exist
as round objects?'' Although no one seemed to have an answer,
passers-by posed questions of their own: ``Why do people look at
the ground when they're walking in the city?'' Why, indeed?
</P>
<P>
   Nearby I was admiring the redo of the Colonial Warehouse
Building, once a repair shop for horse-drawn carriages and later an
electrical plant for 1890s streetcars, and stepped inside Antiques
Riverwalk.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Sarah Randol said she houses 30 dealers with everything
from period furniture to art to lighting, but not collectibles. She
admits she hears from suburbanites that parking in the district is
complicated _ street, valet, parking garages _ and they consider
the area unsafe and unsavory.
</P>
<P>
   There was certainly nothing scary about the place in broad
daylight. As the night progressed, the crowds grew and so did the
rowdiness, on a scale somewhere between Kansas City's Westport and
Chicago's Rush Street. There were numerous young people hanging
around who didn't seem to be headed anyplace.
</P>
<P>
   The time had come to hear some music, so I stopped first at Fine
Line Music Cafe, a well-established club that got its start back
when the district was emerging from its bohemian stage. The club
played hosts to such acts as the Indigo Girls and Crash Test
Dummies.
</P>
<P>
   On tap was the horn-heavy Three-Minute Heroes, a ska band taping
a CD that night. The band emitted lots of energy and quickly
connected with the crowd. The club's main floor and a balcony that
overlooks the stage handles about 500. I thought it had a pretty
intimate feel.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Dario Anselmo told me he's not averse to theme nights
during the week to draw crowds. Thursday night disco was still in,
he said, but the once-popular swing nights were fading fast.
</P>
<P>
   I was happy to camp there a while longer, but it would have been
sacrilegious not to stop in at First Avenue, the old Prince
hangout, and its tiny companion club, 7th Street Entry.
</P>
<P>
   First Avenue is a 1930s Greyhound bus terminal that seems
perfectly designed for a dance club. The huge, unobstructed depot
lobby is the dance floor and a semi-circular mezzanine offers
superb dance-floor views. I was there on a DJ night. For some
reason, videos of horrendous accident scenes were running on the
gigantic screens around the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   I definitely recommend sampling the up-and-coming acts at the
adjacent 7th Street Entry. I found a spot on the risers against the
wall and watched to see who would pop up on stage. One memorable
group was the Ancient Greeks, whose lead singer, with dorky duds
and eyeglasses and a seizurelike dance step, was obviously working
so hard on an attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, alcohol sales here must end at 1 a.m., although
some clubs allow patrons to switch to other beverages and dance
till 3 a.m. Actually, a couple hours of bottled water might not be
a bad idea before getting behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, despite the rap about the district, I think I found
plenty of diversions from the sports bar scene.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, though, you need a completely different kind of
antidote. Cross the river _ it's not far and still part of old
Minneapolis _ to Nye's Bar and Polonaise Room.
</P>
<P>
   A sociologist might use the term ``multigenerational'' for
Nye's. It certainly was that the night I visited.
</P>
<P>
   In the polka bar, a somewhat elderly accordionist was going
great guns. In the restaurant, a table full of young women whooped
it up over a dinnertime bachelorette party. And Lou Snider, a
piano-playing institution here for 35 years, tilted her gently
coifed head and sang George Jones' ``He Stopped Loving Her Today.''
I don't think it was intended for the bride-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Bjerke, a 73-year-old retired educator and a regular at
the piano bar, jumped in on songs when he felt inspired. A request
arrived for ``New York, New York,'' but he declined: ``I just never
liked the song.''
</P>
<P>
   Snider handed over the microphone to 25-year-old Joshua Bowe. A
more recent regular, Bowe drives an hour and a half from Wisconsin
to be here on weekend nights. He sipped his martini, belted out the
Sinatra hit, then told of his plans to start a lounge act.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling hungry? Nye's is a good place for prime rib or one of
the house's unpronounceable Polish specialties. Of course, if you
still want a burger, you know where to go.

HARVARD'S EITZMANN WENT FROM FARM TO FOOTBALL GLORY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Before Highway 8 ends halfway across Nebraska, it dips south and
passes by the rural towns of Chester, Byron, and Hardy. The
concrete-and-aluminum cylinders of grain elevators, water towers,
and church steeples demarcate each settlement along the two-lane
road. Acres of wheat and corn fill in the rest of the landscape
that stretches along the Nebraska-Kansas border.
</P>
<P>
   The Eitzmann family farm sits 4 miles outside Hardy, off a
gravel road connected to Highway 8. The hog lots, the bottom half
of a windmill, and a barn used as a garage flank the main house.
For four generations, the Eitzmanns have planted wheat and corn and
raised hogs and cattle on a parcel of land that now measures 2,500
acres.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard football captain Chris Eitzmann knows the land and life
of a farmer well. He spent his boyhood cultivating and irrigating
crops in the summer, helping with the fall harvest, and feeding the
livestock before school. He drove his first tractor at 10,
accidentally shocked his father with a cattle prod at 15, and
operated the combine at 16. Then at 18, he decided to leave behind
the comfort of the family farm and a scholarship to Nebraska for
the chaos of Harvard Square and Ivy League athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, in New Haven, Conn., Eitzmann will end his college
career against Yale with a sizable contingent of family and friends
from Nebraska in the stands. Along Highway 8, Cornhusker
fans-turned-Crimson supporters will watch the game via satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Eitzmann's time in Cambridge, football has made his
transition from Midwestern farm to East Coast college easier. The
game was a constant in both places.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I came out here for my recruiting trip, I thought this
would be a really awesome place to go to school,'' said Eitzmann.
``Besides, I said to myself, `I don't want to be stuck in a small
town forever. I want to do all these great things.' I just wanted
to get away from Nebraska. If I wanted to do anything with my life,
I knew I'd have to get out of there. Now, after being here for four
years, it's made me appreciate home. It's nice to go back. It's
nice to be able to go outside and know everybody you'll see each
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the reason I was able to adjust so well was football.
Every day, I had football. Instantly, I had 100 guys I was friends
with. You'd walk around campus and see all these people you didn't
know, which was really weird for me because I was so used to
knowing everybody. But at the same time you'd walk around and
always see guys from football.''
</P>
<P>
   When Eitzmann graduated from Chester-Hubbell-Byron High School,
there were 13 students in his senior class. Because of the small
student population, the school offered only one sport to boys each
season. There was football in the fall, basketball in the winter,
and track in the spring. Eitzmann excelled at all three.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the enrollment, the football team switched between
six-man and eight-man leagues. In the six-man game, everyone was
eligible, including the center. The field was 80 yards long and not
as wide as a regulation playing surface. The faster the player, the
more successful he would be. Eight-man more closely resembled the
standard game, except with just three offensive linemen, all
ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 4 inches and 200 pounds, Eitzmann outweighed his
biggest teammate by 30 pounds. He played tailback and linebacker
for the Bulldogs, earning first-team all-state honors on defense
and all-conference honors on both sides of the ball his senior
year. But success in an eight-man league does not naturally
translate to interest from Division 1 and 1-AA programs. And to
this day, Eitzmann remains unsure of exactly what compelled Crimson
coach Tim Murphy to recruit him.
</P>
<P>
   When Harvard first contacted Eitzmann, he and his family did not
take the interest seriously. All Eitzmann wanted from Harvard was a
free trip to Boston, a chance to see a different part of the
country. Prior to visiting the Hub, he had verbally committed to
Nebraska during his recruiting trip to Lincoln, and the Cornhusker
coaches had asked him to sign a letter of intent before leaving
campus. Eitzmann mentioned his visit to Harvard and promised to
sign the letter the day he returned.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for the first time in his life, Eitzmann boarded an
airplane and made the trip east. He arrived at Logan Airport full
of stereotyped ideas about a university famed for academics, not
athletics. (``I thought there's going to be all these nerdy little
kids who play football just because it's something to do.'') He
left impressed by the Crimson program and started to reconsider his
college choice.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy soon flew to Lincoln and drove two hours to the Eitzmann
farm to reinforce the seriousness of Harvard's interest. The
athleticism Eitzmann showed as a track athlete was the biggest
attraction. The Nebraska farm boy had run a 49-second 400-meter
race and had recorded a 22-foot long jump. Murphy could not predict
how Eitzmann would adjust to the rigors of full-squad 1-AA
football, but he knew Eitzmann was an athlete with lots of
potential. Yet before the coach could develop Eitzmann as a player,
he had to convince the Nebraska family to send their eldest son
halfway across the country for college.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're from Harvard, people are extremely receptive,''
said Murphy, who was welcomed by Eitzmann's three younger brothers
wearing Nebraska football jerseys. ``They don't always know if
they'll get in. They don't always know if they'll fit in, but
they're usually very receptive. Well, this was a very stoic farm
family who was not the least bit impressed that I was the Harvard
football coach. Quite frankly, I think they were very comfortable
with Chris's decision to go to the University of Nebraska. It was
just difficult to make any headway in there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chris liked what had seen on the Cambridge campus three
weeks earlier. He liked what he heard during the home visit. Most
of all, he was impressed that Murphy would take the time to visit
him in Nebraska. He gave up his scholarship to the state university
and prepared for school 1,600 miles away from the farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, everyone thought I'd made the wrong decision because
everyone in Nebraska wants to play for Nebraska,'' said Eitzmann.
``But now hardly anyone ever tells me I made the wrong decision.
They're proud of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in his freshman year, Eitzmann questioned his own
decision, asking himself, ``What the hell am I doing here?'' He had
a hard time sleeping with the city noise and people everywhere. He
had arrived at college much smaller than his teammates and was
plagued with self-doubt. He wanted desperately to return home. On
top of everything, the farm nearly went bankrupt Eitzmann's
freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   But within two weeks of moving to his new surroundings, Eitzmann
had built his self-confidence back up. He committed himself to
gaining strength and size by spring football and became comfortable
at his new position, tight end. He learned the offensive and
defensive formations he had seen previously only on television.
Crediting his rural upbringing with giving him a strong work ethic,
the Nebraskan made himself into an integral part of the Harvard
squad.
</P>
<P>
   Eitzmann has started at tight end for three seasons, won an Ivy
League title in 1997, and earned 1999 All-American Farm First Team
honors. Now he serves as the 126th Crimson captain. With one game
left to complete his playing days at Harvard, he has 44 career
receptions for 546 yards and eight touchdowns. Monday, he begins
training with teammate Isaiah Kacyvenski for a possible
professional career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten everything out of (my Harvard experience) that I
wanted to get out of it, and I wouldn't trade it for anything,''
said Eitzmann. ``These past two weeks have been tough for me. Last
week, when I was in the stadium and realized it was the last time I
was going to play there, it was tough. Several times on the field,
I thought to myself, `I can't believe this is over; I don't want
this to end.' Now, I've only got one game left.''

PERFECT GIFTS FOR A NEW ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gift-giving takes a lot of thought and imagination. Entering a
new century gives us the technology and beauty created in the last
100 years, and more, to draw from.
</P>
<P>
   This is also the perfect time to welcome the future with a
collectible keepsake from 1999. Only weeks from now, all such items
will carry the mark of a millennium past. Some will wear well.
</P>
<P>
   Waterford Crystal has designed the Times Square Collection of
crystal ornaments and objects in recognition of the millennium
based on the geodesic sphere called ``Star of Hope'' that Waterford
designed for the climax of the New Year's Eve celebration in New
York City's Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Square sphere is more than 6 feet in diameter and made
from more than 500 pieces of crystal and tiny white lights.
Waterford's motif is based on the triangle, suggesting the flowing
unity of the past, present and future. A myriad of deep wedge cuts
are intended to suggest all the world's people alive at this
historic moment with a light bulb in the central circle of each
triangle symbolizing Earth itself. The seven-pointed Star of Hope
represents the seven continents.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items in the commemorative Waterford collection are
the Star of Hope paperweight ($98), tree ornament ($59), Times
Square ball sculpture ($98) and hurricane candleholder ($198).
</P>
<P>
   In the more affordable range is the Times Square 2000 snow globe
from Macy's for $30. This plastic globe, featuring a colorful paper
image of Times Square with confetti snow, can also double as a
paperweight.
</P>
<P>
   If post-modern celebration rather than keepsake is the aim, and
if you are a lover of fine wine with a corked top, consider the
WineMaster Corkscrew VV200 from Sharper Image for $65. No twisting,
pulling or exertion is required to unleash the bouquet. The cork is
removed by moving the arms of the corkscrew down, then up.
</P>
<P>
   First there was the tricycle, then bicycle and mountain bike.
Now your little one (weighing up to 90 pounds) can have his or her
own motorcycle. The Ride-On Children's Motorcycle for $299, also
from Sharper Image, is a scaled-down version of a classic
motorcycle in every way, but runs on a rechargeable battery. The
bike will operate up to 1 1/2 hours on a single charge of its two
six-volt batteries and reach a speed of approximately three miles
per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about safety while the children are learning to
become easy riders on the sidewalk, as the bike comes with an
unobtrusive pair of removable training wheels.
</P>
<P>
   If love of the outdoors runs in your family, consider some of
the latest in ski technology, with a pair of parabolic skis for
approximately $900. The parabolic shape on both sides of each ski
shortens the turning area, intended to make it much easier to turn.
Ideally, parabolic skis only have to be tipped on edge to turn
flawlessly with a minimum of skier exertion.
</P>
<P>
   For maxing out, there's always the ultimate wish list from the
annual Neiman Marcus Christmas Book, featuring more than 600 ideas
for the whole family.
</P>
<P>
   Included in this year's 11 fantasy gifts (which often are
purchased) is the store's most expensive fantasy gift ever _ a
Boeing Business Jet for $35.25 million unfurnished or $42 to $47
million with a custom interior. Too much, then perhaps you could
time-share it for 100 hours per year for $5.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   If your charge card or bank won't allow you to soar to the
limits, the Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog features some ideas
that are more down-to-earth.
</P>
<P>
   There's a $75 16-inch cultured black freshwater pearl necklace
with a sterling silver toggle clasp by Carolee that's uniquely
packaged in a caviar tin.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a designer mouse would go with the high-tech office of a
computer buff. The mouse, which is compatible with any PS/2
connection, comes in three styles _ Silvertone, burled (wood tone)
or patterned carbon fiber _ for $35 each.
</P>
<P>
   Harking halfway back into the 20th century, there's a remake of
a 1950s radio from Grundig for $199, which has been updated and
improved with two 3-inch side speakers added to the 4-inch center
speaker. A touch of the button allows you to switch from AM/FM to
international shortwave.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you are one of those last-minute shoppers drawing
a blank, there are always gift certificates to buy enough think
time until next year. By then, hopefully, it won't be too late.

EVERY RELIGION GIVES THANKS IN ITS OWN WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HELEN T. GRAY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps because Thanksgiving is a secular holiday, it is a
holiday that Americans of all faiths can embrace.
</P>
<P>
   The intent of the holiday, setting aside a time to give thanks,
reflects a theme of thankfulness that is found in all the major
religions of the world. Teaching on gratitude is a part of Judaism,
Christianity, Hinduism, Islam and other world faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving traditions
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Kansas City area, residents of various faiths
interweave family and spiritual traditions into this uniquely
American holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Morey Schwartz looks forward to observing Thanksgiving
with extended family. This year he, his wife, Deena, and their four
children will spend the holiday with his wife's family in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Thanksgivings we travel,'' said Schwartz of Beth Israel
Abraham and Voliner. ``Rabbis aren't able to do that on religious
holidays. We call Thanksgiving `the rabbi's holiday' because it
doesn't require us to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   At Conception Abbey all the monks come back for Thanksgiving,
said the Rev. Kenneth Reichert, prior. The Wednesday before
Thanksgiving, the Benedictine monks hold a memorial celebration,
giving thanks for the lives of the monks and their family members
who have died in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a special celebration of the Eucharist Thanksgiving
morning and then a regular Thanksgiving feast,'' Reichert said.
``After that we don't do much. We're usually tired after that big
meal,'' he said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hindu home of Priti and Pyare Mohan, the couple and their
son, Amit, gather with friends and do their daily prayer before
eating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all feel grateful because most Hindus have a place to
worship in their own homes, to pray and to offer thanks,'' said
Priti Mohan of Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   At the home of the Rev. Randy Beeman of Edwardsville Christian
Church, family members gather around the table and each one shares
at least one great blessing each has received from God in the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   His church family uses the occasion to worship the Sunday night
before the holiday with churches in the Bonner Springs and
Edwardsville area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus is not on doctrinal, cultural or theological
differences but our common thankfulness to God,'' Beeman said. ``We
always close with a time of fellowship where all the believers of
both communities have a time to share favorite stories and renew
friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   The church's junior and high-school youth also go door to door
in Edwardsville collecting nonperishable items for food baskets
that they deliver to needy families the week before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen Ahmed said Muslims celebrate Thanksgiving ``every day
with every meal in every prayer.'' She is a founder of the Crescent
Peace Society, a nonprofit group that enhances an awareness and
understanding of Muslim culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanksgiving in America is an important occasion for thanking
Allah for all that we have,'' she said. ``We must remember the poor
and needy and take this opportunity to invite the lonely to our
homes, as did the pilgrims. My husband and I are immigrants, and
every Thanksgiving our three children and we thank God and thank
this beautiful country for all that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachings on thanksgiving
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama has said that every major religion of the world
has the same goal of making their followers into better human
beings. Part of that is their teachings on the importance of being
grateful. Although similar, each teaching carries the perspective
of that faith's particular history and tradition. Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   - Buddhism: ``The Buddha said that two things are remarkably
rare in this world, which is people who benefit others and people
who feel gratitude,'' said Ben Worth of the American Buddhist
Center. ``So we focus on the positive in people; we cultivate an
appreciation for our ancestors who have made this life possible for
us. We give thanks for the sacrifices people have made for freedom
and democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   - American Indian spirituality: Traditionally thanks was given
for different events, such as the close of the harvest and the end
of winter, said Justin Orr of the Heart of America Indian Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a continuous, constant thing and not an
isolated event that you would call Thanksgiving,'' he said.
``Native American spirituality almost commands us to praise God
every day. It is an ongoing part of our lives. We don't lift up a
specific time to give thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   - Christianity: Reichert said Christians should always give
thanks, especially to God, and that also means giving thanks to
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Benedictines, our whole life is meant to be a way of giving
thanks,'' he said. ``We do this especially by coming together six
times a day every day for prayer. In all those prayers, we remember
to give thanks to God and our many friends, family and
benefactors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a time to foster an attitude of gratitude,'' Beeman
said. ``It is a time for people of the church to put their
blessings in perspective and provide help to those in need of help
and encouragement in the name of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a time to set the stage for Advent. It is a time to help
people focus on what they do have and what they have received from
God instead of focusing on what they don't have. It is a time to
give thanks always to Jesus, the Christ, our Lord and Saviour.''
</P>
<P>
   - Judaism: Abraham P. Bloch's A Book of Jewish Ethical Concepts
says, ``The rabbis utilized prescribed benedictions, prayers and
homiletic passages to emphasize the importance of appreciation. ...
The abundance of benedictions which Jews recite in the course of
the day attests to the significance attached to expressions of
appreciation. Their formulation was in accord with a basic Talmudic
principle: `It is forbidden to enjoy anything in this world without
the recitation of a benediction.' (Berachot 35a)''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said that for Jews, doing social action is not just a
good thing to do, but the fulfillment of God's command. He said God
performed an important act of social justice toward the Jews by
delivering them from slavery in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learn to empathize with people and their plights,''
Schwartz said. ``So there is the sense of being commanded to act
compassionately as God did.''
</P>
<P>
   - Hinduism: ``Thanks are given in an elaborate manner to various
forms of gods for different reasons and for different occasions at
different times and in different parts of the country,'' Mohan
said. ``For example, to the sun for its powerful and healthy rays
for the crops to grow well.
</P>
<P>
   ``... We are thankful and grateful to our parents for bringing
us in this world, the saints and holy men for guidance through
Vedas and Holy Scriptures for a better life for us, to God for
giving us the highest form of life as a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   - Islam: Many verses in the Qur'an tell Muslims to be thankful
to God, parents, teachers, workers, employers and everything that
God has created, Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muslims show their thanks to God in many prayers,'' she said.
``... Allah says in the Qur'an, `If you thank me I shall give
more.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Prayers of thanksgiving
</P>
<P>
   The following tapestry of prayers from different faiths shows
that gratitude is universal among religions:
</P>
<P>
   This food is the gift of the whole universe, the earth, the sky
and much hard work.
</P>
<P>
   May we live in a manner worthy to deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   May we transform our unskillful states of mind and learn to eat
in moderation.
</P>
<P>
   May we take only enough to nourish us and prevent illness.
</P>
<P>
   We accept this food to realize the path of understanding and
love.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhist prayer
</P>
<P>
   Father, all powerful,
</P>
<P>
   your gifts of love are countless
</P>
<P>
   and your goodness infinite.
</P>
<P>
   On Thanksgiving Day we come before you
</P>
<P>
   with gratitude for your kindness:
</P>
<P>
   open our hearts to concern for our brothers and sisters
</P>
<P>
   so that we may share your gifts in loving service.
</P>
<P>
   Benedictine prayer
</P>
<P>
   We ever thank thee, who art the Lord our God and the God of our
fathers. Thou art the strength of our life and our saving shield.
In every generation we will thank thee and recount thy praise _ for
our lives which are in thy charge, for our souls which are in thy
care, for thy miracles which are daily with us, and for thy
continual wonders and favors _ evening, morning and noon.
Beneficent One, whose mercies never fail, Merciful One, whose
kindnesses never cease, thou has always been our hope.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish prayer
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to God. Today let us all sit together and sing the songs
of thanks to the Lord whose glory is sung day and night by virtuous
people.
</P>
<P>
   In temples, caves and on mountaintops people constantly offer
thanks time and again.
</P>
<P>
   In jungles, birds enjoy on tree branches singing songs of
thankfulness and are recipient of bliss and happiness.
</P>
<P>
   In wells, tanks and in deep spring of sea even aquatic creatures
give thanks.
</P>
<P>
   In marriages, hymns and religious festivities everyone offers
thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Hindu prayer
</P>
<P>
   Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Worship the Lord with gladness;
</P>
<P>
   come before him with joyful songs.
</P>
<P>
   Know that the Lord is God.
</P>
<P>
   It is he who made us, and we are his;
</P>
<P>
   we are his people, the sheep of his pasture.
</P>
<P>
   Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise;
</P>
<P>
   give thanks to him and praise his name.
</P>
<P>
   For the Lord is good and his love endures forever;
</P>
<P>
   his faithfulness continues through all generations.
</P>

HARVARD PROF IS STILL WAY OUT THERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Mack is back.
</P>
<P>
   (Do you think the New York Post could possibly resist this
headline: WACKO MACK-O IS BACK-O!)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Mack is the Harvard psychiatrist who made perhaps too
much news when his best-selling 1994 book, ``Abduction,'' lent his
considerable academic prestige to ordinary Americans' tales of
being abducted by aliens. Following a close encounter with a secret
Harvard Medical School investigative committee, Mack went back to
doing what he had been doing. It's a bit disinegenuous to say he's
back; ``I never went away,'' he points out.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Mack has kept his name out of the headlines. He
removed the Harvard logo from his Cambridge-based Program for
Extraordinary Experience Research (PEER), and he went about
gathering material for his latest book, ``Passport to the Cosmos:
Human Transformation and Alien Encounters.'' This spring, PEER
sponsored a multi-disciplinary study group at the Harvard Divinity
School on anomalous experiences, and earlier this week Mack
unveiled a walk-through, multi-media exhibit (MackWorld?), ``Voices
of the Experience,'' at the New York Academy of Medicine. Mack can
now wax philosophical about the Star Chamber investigation that
might have cost him his job: ``Saying that we should look at
reality differently was quite provocative. I might have reacted
similarly if I were in the dean's position.''
</P>
<P>
   The funding profile for PEER, which was once mainly supported by
Laurance Rockefeller, has changed. Rockefeller's contributions will
be dwindling into the five figures, and supplanted by grants from
nontraditional foundations like Lifebridge and the Fetzer
Foundation. ``These issues still aren't totally mainstream,'' Mack
says. ``But there is an increasing interest in science and academia
with human experiences that dont't fit into any category.''
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, Mack had never heard of my new favorite TV show,
``Roswell,'' a drama about three teens in a small New Mexico town
who are a little different from the other boys and girls...
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Monitor News
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Science Monitor is launching a new product,
Monitor Week, to be sold as an insert for weekly newspapers across
the country. MW will be a full-color, 12-page ``mini version of the
Monitor'' daily newspaper, according to a spokesman, with national
and international stories written by Monitor reporters. On its end,
the Boston-based church will sell two pages of national advertising
for the magazine, and clients, who have to pay to print the insert,
will have the back page to sell to local advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The Monitor has been sounding out publishers on the idea, and
one outsider describes the response as ``moderate.'' ``All the
research says that weekly newspapers have to be local, local,
local,'' according to my man. ``They may be lucky with this, and
they may not.'' The Monitor has signed up its first client in
Traverse City, Mich., and naturally expects to add many more before
the Jan. 27 launch date.

SENIOR CRITICISMS: HOLLYWOOD SEES GREEN FROM GRAYING AUDIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN McTAVISH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did you know that 20 percent of movie tickets sold last year in
the United States were bought by people 50 and older, including 9
percent who were 60 and older?
</P>
<P>
   Today one in five moviegoers is either nearing or has reached
traditional retirement age _ hardly the hot young demographic
sought by most Hollywood producers.
</P>
<P>
   So why are more older folks going to the movies? What do they
want to see? And is Tinseltown giving it to them?
</P>
<P>
   Jack Poessiger, host and producer of the radio magazine ``Jack
Goes to the Movies'' on KYYS-FM, says the growth of movie channels
and pay-per-view movies on TV has increased interest among seniors
in seeing movies. And there's certainly no shortage of screens _
34,168 in 1998 compared to 23,129 a decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Poessiger says, the perception of a movie's quality
rather than its trendiness or popularity is what puts the older
crowd in theater seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want proof that it's going to be worth the money and the
time,'' he said. They want to see what the critics have to say.
That's why they don't rush out the first weekend like the kids do
for the teen-oriented stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Bette Levin, acting director of public affairs for the American
Association of Retired Persons in Washington, believes films that
offer a realistic mix of young and old characters are a gateway to
the mature movie audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I like to go see `The Matrix' with Keanu Reeves flying
around in black leather,'' Levin said. ``But the things that really
resonate are the plots and storylines that I can identify with.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Hollywood is looking for plots, just look at people in
their 50s. They're getting divorced, they're remarrying, parenting
first and second families and grandparenting. They're losing jobs
or making major career moves, taking care of parents, experiencing
the empty-nest syndrome or having their kids move back home.
They're retiring, traveling and some of them are solitary
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man or woman experiencing being single for the first time in
25 years might go to the movies more often. They might be seeking
new role models.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, they might have trouble finding them, said Marilyn
Hennessy, president of the Retirement Research Foundation in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   For every movie featuring strong older characters _ such as Cher
in ``Tea With Mussolini,'' Anthony Hopkins in ``Meet Joe Black,''
Paul Newman in ``Message in a Bottle,'' Richard Farnsworth in ``The
Straight Story'' or Susan Sarandon in ``Anywhere But Here'' _ many
more do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movie producers tend to feel that older people are not
photogenic,'' Hennessy said. ``They'd prefer younger people who are
wrinkle-free.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to find out what discriminating, mature movie-goers
think about box-office fare, The Star invited a group of older
members of the Kansas City Film Society to a screening of ``The
Straight Story,'' the critically acclaimed David Lynch film about a
73-year-old man who makes an unlikely cross-country journey atop a
riding lawn mower. Here's what some of them had to say:
</P>
<P>
   - Dorothy Loeffler, 80, Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'': ``I enjoyed it. I thought it was a
little slow moving. But, after all, older people are slow moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Favorite film: ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   I enjoy movies that show older people: ``still in the mainstream
of life, doing something, being active.''
</P>
<P>
   I avoid movies that show older people: ``handicapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Message to Hollywood: ``Have a mixture of older and younger
people in the same movie, rather than having mostly young people.
Because old people are around and they're doers.''
</P>
<P>
   - Pat Newman, 65, Kansas City
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'': ``Visually beautiful. I liked the
message, too. It was wonderfully slow. And Richard Farnsworth was
so great. He's one of my favorite actors.''
</P>
<P>
   Favorite film: ``Blue Velvet.''
</P>
<P>
   I enjoy movies that show older people: ``not having
face-lifts.''
</P>
<P>
   I avoid movies that show older people: ``being self-righteous.''
</P>
<P>
   Message to Hollywood: ``Get real. Too much makeup. Too many
diamonds. Hollywood is too glitzy.''
</P>
<P>
   - Paul Grollman, 76, Overland Park, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'': ``I kind of enjoyed it because it was
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Favorite film: ``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   I enjoy movies that show older people: ``doing what older people
do. Most of the movies we see nowadays feature young people or
kids. I guess they don't think life goes much past a certain
point.''
</P>
<P>
   I avoid movies that show older people: ``I really haven't seen
that many movies with older people to make much of a comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Message to Hollywood: ``There isn't much sometimes for us older
folks to be watching, when the movies are made up entirely of young
kids. I just don't think the movies today are the kind I like to
see so much.''
</P>
<P>
   - Jan Grebe, 58, Roeland Park, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'': ``I loved the characterizations. It
showed that older people are just as complicated as younger people
_ maybe more so by the time they get to be old.''
</P>
<P>
   Favorite film: ``The Three Penny Opera.''
</P>
<P>
   I enjoy movies that show older people: ``living their lives in a
way that pleases them.''
</P>
<P>
   I avoid movies that show older people: ``being
two-dimensional.''
</P>
<P>
   Message to Hollywood: ``Start watching more foreign movies.''
</P>
<P>
   - Jim Grebe, 54, Roeland Park, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'': ``It showed you're never too old to rise
to a challenge, as crazy as it might be.''
</P>
<P>
   Favorite film: ``Lately I've seen `The Buena Vista Social Club,'
which was about elderly people. I saw `Afterlife,' which had some
great portrayals of elderly Japanese people.''
</P>
<P>
   I enjoy movies that show older people: ``Not particularly older
people, but just sensitive characterizations of people.''
</P>
<P>
   I avoid movies that show older people: ``in formula roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Message to Hollywood: ``Take a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   - Ed Daleske, 72, Prairie Village, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'': ``I found it a bit tedious. (But)
Richard Farnsworth did a marvelous job. That's an Academy Award
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Favorite film: ``Night of the Shooting Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   I enjoy movies that show older people: ``I'm not sure I'd draw a
distinction between people of different ages. I like the movie
`American Beauty,' and that had two or three generations.''

POLICY _ NOT PERSONALITY _ SHOULD DRIVE HMO REGULATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Massachusetts, the cradle of liberty, is also a cradle for the
business of managed health care. But ironically, the state with one
of the most mature managed care industries in the nation offers
some of the weakest regulatory protections.
</P>
<P>
   This statement has nothing to do with liking or not liking
Charles Baker, the new chief executive who is trying to turn around
financially-troubled Harvard Pilgrim Health Care.
</P>
<P>
   It's about policy, not personality. But unfortunately, a key
moment in the debate over the future of managed care in
Massachusetts is being defined by a matter of utter irrelevance _
Baker's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone likes Baker, formerly the state's top fiscal
officer. Pundits praise everything from his brilliance with numbers
to his full head of hair. But as a recent song by Shania Twain puts
it: ``Okay, you're a genius. That don't impress me much.''
</P>
<P>
   What is impressive is an ability to see the big picture, not
just the small one. As head of Harvard Pilgrim, that's not Baker's
responsibility, but it is the responsibility of our elected
officials. Where are they?
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight is currently trained on Harvard Pilgrim as it
fights furiously to achieve financial stability and avoid
bankruptcy. The state's largest HMO made some basic business
mistakes under since-deposed management, expanding too much and
underpricing its product to gain market share.
</P>
<P>
   Now Harvard Pilgrim has a new management team and claims to have
a recovery plan. Because Baker is big on Beacon Hill, most
politicians seem willing to give him time to work out financial
problems without asking too many questions.
</P>
<P>
   But there are questions to be asked. Among them: what assets
will Harvard Pilgrim be selling off? What unprofitable lines of
business will it shed? In short, what exactly is the plan to make
Harvard Pilgrim profitable? And who will be out of health coverage,
as a result?
</P>
<P>
   Legislators endorsed an HMO insolvency bill which gives the
state insurance commissioner power to get involved in the event of
a health plan's failure. That is minimal oversight. It is a
reasonable first step, but hardly the systemic approach needed not
just for dealing with Harvard Pilgrim, but with the entire HMO
industry.
</P>
<P>
   There are three or four dominant health care providers in
Massachusetts and no one in the state with specific responsibility
for making sure we know what they are doing. We strictly regulate
auto insurance. But with health plans, there is almost no
oversight. As a result, the public is not well-protected.
</P>
<P>
   Many states require insurers to meet defined reserve
requirements. That's not the case here. Most states require full
and timely reporting by HMOs of enrollment, utilization and
financial data. In Massachusetts, such reporting is required but
there are gaps in reporting and problems with timeliness.
</P>
<P>
   Most states have ``receivership'' laws, which enable the
insurance regulator oversight over financially-troubled plans, a
measure included in the bill just passed by the Massachusetts
Legislature. Several states _ but not Massachusetts _ have
``insolvency fund'' requirements whihc assure that in the event of
an HMO bankruptcy, providers will receive some payment for services
rendered.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts also lacks patient protections. For example, 18
states currently enable patients to appeal HMO denials of care
otuside their health plan. States like New York and Rhode Island
have strong utilization review standards that ensure the quality of
health care decisions made by health plans. At least 36 states have
laws and regulations that require prompt payment of claims for
insurance carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``HMOs have become the principle way we guarantee health
coverage for people in Massachusetts,'' says Andrew Dreyfus of the
Massachusetts Hospital Assn., which worries Harvard Pilgrim will
use its financial problems to pay its members less than it owes.
``But there are gaping holes in the safety net to protect
subscribers and caregivers. We wouldn't allow those kind of holes
in any other important area of public enterprise, but in the most
important of all _ health care _ we simply let the market make the
key decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State William Galvin also questions the wisdom of
letting the market call the shots on HMOs in general and on Harvard
Pilgrim in particular. ``I trust Charlie Baker. I have no problem
with Charlie Baker,'' notes Galvin. ``But he now wears a different
hat. His interest is with his company. Someone has to be there
representing the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   People can argue over who that someone should be. They can ask
whether the state attorney general rather than the secretary of
state should be leading the charge _ and wonder why the governor
seems to be avoiding the topic. They can also think about an even
bigger picture: how to get the insurance companies, HMOs,
hospitals, physician groups and employers _ the entire health
provider network _ to work together instead of against each other.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, is about policy, not personality and it's about time
Massachusetts focused on it.

LIVING WITH AN ATTITUDE OF GRATITUDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN UHLENHUTH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Liz Brown believes in saying thanks _ out loud, every day, over
and over, to particular persons and to the universe in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a transformational experience,'' says Brown of
Kansas City, Mo. ``Saying thank you is really a powerful statement.
I think it keeps the flow of good coming my way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find myself saying thank you a lot, for every little thing.
It's amazing how many little things there are in a day ... the
parking space that happens to be open, the phone line that frees
up, the light that happens to change when you need it.''
</P>
<P>
   The day we set aside to eat turkey and pumpkin pie is also the
day when many of us make a point of saying thanks. But there's a
powerful case to be made for living the grateful life day in and
day out.
</P>
<P>
   Gratitude, Brown says, is ``the easiest way to get more out of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Lark Mason, a social worker who counsels patients in her
Overland Park, Kan., office, say that the issue of gratitude, or a
lack of it, comes up often in counseling sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what I do, and I think most therapists do, is to help
people broaden their perspective,'' she says. ``When there's a
specific issue they're grappling with, they tend to hyperfocus on
it and see that as the only thing in their lives. An important part
of therapy is to look for what is right, what is good and help them
get some emotional balance.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, she says, doesn't necessarily come naturally to many
of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is some tendency within human nature to become
accustomed to the way things are. And because of that, it's easy to
begin to take things for granted. It's a conscious choice to begin
to focus on showing appreciation.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, Lora Manny suspected that a lack of
appreciation might be at the root of some of her frustrations and
unhappiness. She'd allowed herself to be caught up in the rat race.
The Merriam, Kan., resident was ``trying to climb the corporate
ladder and doing it for all the wrong reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Promotions, the legal secretary figured, would get her more
money so she could buy more things.
</P>
<P>
   Manny took a class on prosperity and gratitude. The group's
mission: to become more consciously grateful.
</P>
<P>
   One important tool toward that end was a journal in which Manny
daily made note of that which deserved her thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory was to quit focusing on what you don't have and
focus more on being content with what you have.''
</P>
<P>
   She has found it effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a great calming effect. It quieted an urge to be more
of a consumer. It reminds me that that isn't what I'm about.''
</P>
<P>
   Documenting her good fortune on paper, she says, ``has made me
aware of how many things are more important than the material. When
faced with a crisis of any sort, all that stuff fades away, and you
focus on people you love.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason sometimes assigns her patients homework about gratitude.
She might ask them to list five ways in which they could show
appreciation to family members, or 10 things they appreciated
during the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a good cup of coffee, or `My spouse made a wonderful
meal,' or `I got to go to a play.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Noticing beauty and goodness ``is part of being alive,'' she
says. But she says it also equips one to cope with difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you can maintain that focus, whatever life's ups
and downs are, you can ride them out much more positively.'' Mason
has known people with chronic illness to report experiencing their
diagnosis as a wake-up call to everything they do have _ a home,
friends, food to eat, a rewarding job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy not to notice those things unless you consciously
pay attention. If you pay attention, you can have peace and a sense
of God's abundance.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed there's nothing like losing it all, or coming close, to
focus the mind on what one has, as Liz Brown found.
</P>
<P>
   One of her bothers died 18 years ago. For the family, it was a
hard but helpful lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through his death we started saying `I love you' more and
seeing how life is to so fragile and temporary. You have to get to
the point where things are taken away, or almost taken away, and
then you wake up and see beauty that surrounds us.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown got a second lesson seven years ago following ``a pretty
horrible descent into drugs and alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Being in the grip of addiction severed her connections ``to
people, to the planet, to life. It's like being an automaton.''
</P>
<P>
   As Brown got control over her addiction with the help of several
treatment centers, Alcoholics Anonymous and a halfway house, she
says she had a spiritual epiphany and gained ``new eyes'' and that
little by little, she ``noticed the power of gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to verbalizing her thanks frequently each day, Brown
says she tries to abide by another related rule: Never to allow a
kind thought to go unspoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hear someone say something nice about someone, I always
make it a point to pass it along. Even strangers, I'll tell them,
`That's a beautiful dress.' It's like a chain reaction. People just
light up. The more we hear of that, it really lifts all of us up. I
feel it's a trickling effect. It breeds good energy.''  &LR; brk:Time
enough for thanks
</P>
<P>
   In fact there is evidence that we can breed our own good
psychological energy and even alter the way messages are passed
from one brain cell to the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``The research indicates that repetitive thought patterns ... do
result in changes in brain function'' and ultimately in one's mood
and attitude, says Joseph Coyle, chairman of the psychiatry
department at the Harvard Medical School. ``We don't know yet
precisely what are the underlying molecular processes that do that.
But the concept that mental practice can change brain function is
pretty well demonstrated.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that we can moderate our moods by manipulating our
thoughts in a certain direction is at the heart of cognitive
therapy, a widely practiced form of psychotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Coyle cited one recent study done at the University of
California-Los Angeles that found that among a group of 20 people
with obsessive-compulsive disorder, those treated with cognitive
therapy showed just as much change in brain function as did those
who were treated with drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Brody, an assistant professor of psychiatry at UCLA,
recently did a similar study on a group of depressed patients. He,
too, found that so-called talk therapy caused as much change in
brain function as did drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   All of which should give encouragement to those who would
cultivate a more appreciative attitude toward life. Carol J. Meyer
of Roeland Park, Kan., firmly believes we have the power to grow
more grateful. However, certain aspects of modern life tend to get
in the way of gratitude, says the onetime Catholic nun who now runs
a spirituality ministry she calls WisdomWays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's in too big a hurry. Part of it is getting in the
moment and letting go of worry and fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go for walks most days. When I'm there, I focus on seeing
what is around me and not thinking the whole time. It's like a
meditation where I say, `I'm seeing these trees and clouds and
breathing this air and being with what's around me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When I eat by myself, I don't watch TV, I don't read. I strive
to be mindful of what I'm doing and the joy of that and being
grateful, thanking the food, as it were.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Noelker-Pendleton also says the hurried pace has pushed
gratitude to the side and perhaps off the slate altogether. A
social worker in private practice in Johnson County,
Noelker-Pendleton often gives her patients a nudge in that
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I urge people to take those moments, a few in the evening, a
few in the morning, even before they get out of bed, (to give
thanks) that they are able to get out of bed, for their health, for
friends and family.''
</P>
<P>
   When people tell her they don't have time, and they do tell her
that, Noelker-Pendleton says to herself, ``They don't have time not
to say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, too, doesn't buy the argument that appreciation takes too
much time. When you're walking out the door at the end of a
workday, she says, you might as well be looking at the sunset.

GORE STAKES OUT HIGHER GROUND ON THE WAR ON DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- In a major departure from both Republicans and his
own White House, Vice President and Democratic presidential
candidate Al Gore all but said the laws that treat crack cocaine
far more harshly than powdered cocaine should be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Senate voted to reduce disparities that were
imposed by Congress in the late 1980s. A person currently caught
with 5 grams of crack cocaine would get the same five-year sentence
as a person caught with 500 grams of powder, a 100-to-1 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, by the narrowest of margins, 50 to 49, voted to
reduce the ratio to 10 to 1. But Gore said that is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remaining disparities should be dealt with,'' Gore said
Wednesday in a teleconference interview with the Trotter Group, an
organization of African-American columnists. ``I respect the views
of the law enforcement professionals who argue that there is some
justification, but I don't see it myself.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a good reason that Gore sees no justification for any
disparities, disparities that helped fuel the astronomical
explosion in the black prison population over the last 15 years.
There are none. Medical research has found no or extremely little
difference in the pharmacology of crack and powder. There was never
any proof that crack caused 10 times more crime, let alone 100.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the laws were passed during a period of mass hysteria,
a frenzy that was fed with the stereotype that crack was a
``black'' street drug. It did not matter that federal statistics
said over and over that between 52 and 63 percent of the users of
crack were actually white. Law enforcement cracked down almost
exclusively on black inner-city neighborhoods. Despite the fact
that nearly two-thirds of crack's users are white, 84 percent of
those sentenced in federal courts for crack were African-American.
</P>
<P>
   The 100-to-1 law became the top symbol of racism for a criminal
injustice system that made the so-called War on Drugs a war on
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Even though African-Americans consume merely their fair share of
illegal drugs, 13 percent, they make up 35 percent of those
arrested for possession, 55 percent of those convicted and 74
percent of those sentenced to prison.
</P>
<P>
   It is enough for Gore to say in general on Wednesday that the
so-called War on Drugs ``certainly hasn't succeeded,'' and that
future progress will be made if Congress's formula for funding the
war moves away from the two-thirds prosecution and prisons and
one-third treatment and prevention to something more balanced.
</P>
<P>
   On an issue disparaged by many Republicans and given lip service
by President Clinton, Gore said it was a ``disgrace'' that people
seeking drug treatment find it tragically hard to get.
</P>
<P>
   According to federal statistics, 57 percent of all inmates in
state prisons used drugs in the month before their arrest. Yet the
percentage of prisoners in drug treatment has dropped from an
already woeful 1 in 4 inmates in 1991 to 1 in 10 in 1997. The
percentage of federal prisoners in drug treatment has been cut by
nearly half, from 15.7 percent in 1991 to 9.7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to know how hard Gore will push such issues in a
political world that punishes candidates who are seen as soft on
crime.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with the Trotter Group in 1995 and 1997, Clinton
acknowledged the disparities in the crack laws, but did not
challenge the Republicans to eliminate them. Instead, Attorney
General Janet Reno proposed reducing the 100 to 1 ratio to the 10
to 1 that the Senate has approved, a ratio which would still
disproportionately imprison African American offenders.
</P>
<P>
   At least Gore seems to be staking out a higher ground. Talking
about the crack versus powder laws, he said, ``I would start from
the assumption that they ought to be equal and I think the burden
of proof should be borne by those who say they should not be
equal.''
</P>
<P>
   Had such proof been demanded a decade ago, we might have avoided
the tragedy of watching a city's worth of people being hauled off
to jail, mainly on nonviolent possession charges. The percentage of
drug offenders in state prisons has grown from 6 percent in 1980 to
25 percent. The percentage of drug offenders in federal prisons has
exploded from 25 percent in 1980 to 60 percent today. Sometime next
year, the prison population will cross the 2 million mark, four
times the number in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Reversing this crisis will be an important and unpopular task
for the next president. Gore, like Clinton, has often been tagged
as an incrementalist, tinkering with issues but rarely pressing for
wholesale change. Eliminating the crack disparities and sharply
increasing the funds for drug treatment would be a sign that the
tinkering is over and Gore has put the burden of proof on the
forces of injustice. He would be telling the nation that the fear
of being soft on crime will not scare him away from being fair on
crime.

   His head is bowed, and strands of his shaggy brown hair dangle
over his forehead. He looks dejected, defeated, spent. If the
trumpeter wasn't in the middle of a jazz set at New York's
legendary Village Vanguard, you might mistake him for a man who
just received some bad news or is waiting for a bus.
</P>
<P>
   In fact Harrell is waiting for his solo and his chance to reveal
once again his rapturous artistry on the horn. The music is heading
that way, and he knows he has to be in the moment. He knows he has
to focus. His bandmates and his audience expect nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed when Harrell plays, he comes vividly alive. No one would
suspect that he is schizophrenic.
</P>
<P>
   The trumpeter, who also plays flugelhorn and leads a quintet at
the Folly Theater on Friday, makes music as spellbinding as his
conversation is sporadic. His appearance at the Vanguard two years
ago in a quartet fronted by saxophonist Joe Lovano was
quintessential Harrell, stasis giving way to beauty.
</P>
<P>
   But Harrell, whose latest album on the RCA Victor label is the
modern big-band outing ``Time's Mirror,'' seldom works as a
sideman. Mostly he leads his own combos and concentrates on his own
compositions. At least one of his tunes, ``Sail Away,'' is
generally acknowledged as a jazz standard.
</P>
<P>
   The trumpeter, who regularly places highly in readers' and
critics' polls in Down Beat magazine, concentrates on maintaining a
viable career despite a medical condition that would dissuade most
others. An estimated 2.5 million Americans suffer from
schizophrenia, a psychosis by psychiatric definition that affects
an individual's ability to distinguish real experiences from
imaginary ones. It may also impair one's ability to think logically
or to behave appropriately in social situations. Its cause has not
been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Harrell, 53, has been diagnosed as a borderline schizophrenic.
In conversation he seems willing to talk about schizophrenia in
general terms, perhaps as a means of inspiring others afflicted
with the disorder, but reluctant to address its impact on his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to stay healthy,'' the trumpeter said from his home
in New York. ``I try to exercise and go walking. I have the right
diet, and I try to eat vegetables and steak to get protein.'' His
wife, Angela, manages his career as well as assisting with his
diet. Vitamins and medication also help keep his condition under
control. Without medication, he has trouble concentrating.
</P>
<P>
   Even with medication, just carrying on a conversation sometimes
can be a challenge, particularly if he's tired or jet-lagged from
touring. His responses to questions can seem tentative, disjointed
or abrupt: ``I can't connect my ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the bandstand and in the studio, Harrell is an effective
and inspiring leader. ``He's listening all the time,'' said Don
Braden, a saxophonist and frequent collaborator who also records
for RCA Victor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might think he's not, but he's there,'' said Braden, who
is a musical supervisor with the ``Cosby'' television series. ``He
comes in when he's supposed to come in; he starts when he's
supposed to start. And everything rolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Many individuals afflicted with schizophrenia are gifted
artists, said Abram Hoffer, a psychiatrist and co-author of the
book How to Live With Schizophrenia. In some cases schizophrenia is
believed to have a beneficial effect on creativity, Hoffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Just what impact it has had on Harrell's artistry probably will
never be known. For the trumpeter, jazz has been a lifelong
pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Urbana, Ill., but reared in Los Altos, Calif., on the
San Francisco peninsula, he had the advantage of growing up in a
musical household. His parents had a vast record collection, he
recalled, which included numerous albums by Duke Ellington and
Louis Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   The young Harrell was profoundly affected by the sound of swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started dancing to the rhythms when I was a small child,''
he said. ``And I liked the sound of the trumpet.'' By the time he
was 8, he had started playing trumpet, and by 13 he was honing his
horn skills in Bay Area jam sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Harrell's affliction began to surface while he was studying at
Stanford University, from which he graduated in 1969 with a degree
in music composition. ``I started to lose the ability to
concentrate,'' he said. But by taking medication that helped him
screen out distractions, he was able to remain committed to his
art.
</P>
<P>
   The trumpeter has worked for some of the most esteemed artists
in jazz. Equally attuned to jazz modalities from the traditional to
the progressive, he has employed his full, beautiful tone in
service to such masters as Woody Herman, Horace Silver, Bill Evans,
Gerry Mulligan and Phil Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Harrell said his style on the horn reflects his different
influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first was Armstrong,'' he said. ``Then I listened to Roy
Eldridge and Clifford Brown, Blue Mitchell and Kenny Dorham.'' From
his musical forebears, he learned about ``different ways of playing
fresh ideas to try to tell a story.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending much of his career recording for small jazz
labels, Harrell has seen his profile raised by his recent releases
on the more prominent RCA Victor. ``Labyrinth,'' his 1996 debut on
the label, was a splendid small-group excursion distinguished by
the artist's spare, angular compositions. JazzTimes said Harrell
``has long since established himself as one of the more outstanding
exponents of his instruments, and with this (album) he displays
considerable skills as a tunesmith.''
</P>
<P>
   The trumpeter followed that success with last year's ``The Art
of Rhythm,'' a Latin-accented disc that explored shifting time
signatures and employed ever-changing instrumentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time's Mirror,'' released in September, represents Harrell's
latest effort to ``come up with new ideas and try out new things.''
The big-band program mixes originals by the trumpeter with
evocative interpretations of jazz standbys including ``Autumn
Leaves'' and ``Chasin' the Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   As Harrell looks ahead, he sees unlimited possibilities, places
where his music can go, challenges he's ready to face. Whatever
happens, he plans to remain grounded in reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have a disability,'' he said. ``But I think if more
attention were focused on schizophrenia and other mental
conditions, it would be recognized that a mental condition is also
a physical condition. And people would have more understanding.''

MORE VENTILATION MAY END MOISTURE

<P>
   Q. I have condensation in my attic, where there is some
pressed-board flooring. Moisture seems to be coming up through the
pressed board. The insulation in my attic floor, under the pressed
board, is not wet, but there is no vapor barrier under it. I have a
ridge vent, and six soffit vents on each side of the house. What
can I do to get rid of what moisture is there? The bathroom fan
exhausts through one of those soffit vents.
</P>
<P>
   TOM FULGONI, Billerica, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. That moisture on the pressed board is not coming up through
the pressed board, but is condensation of moisture already in the
attic. To get rid of it, I suggest adding more soffit vents (vents
on the underside of the roof overhang). To put in a vapor barrier
under the existing insulation is difficult, but this is not
necessary because the ceiling paint in the rooms below may form a
vapor barrier; or you can paint the ceilings with a vapor arrier
paint. BIN, a white-pigmented shellac, is a vapor barrier.
</P>
<P>
   While it's OK to exhaust the bathroom through a soffit vent,
make sure the duct carrying the air fits snugly in the vent; in
other words, you do not want the duct to just lie there in front of
the soffit vent; that would allow excess moisture into the attic.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We own a house in Maine with asbestos siding. A company said
it would power-wash the siding to clean it. Is this acceptable?
</P>
<P>
   ELEANOR LAMBERTSON, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. No. Power-washing asbestos-cement siding can release asbestos
fibers into the air. I don't think this is a federal or
state-by-state law, but power-washing that kind of siding should
not be done anywhere, any way. Asbestos-cement siding should not be
sanded, scraped, or anything else but washed with detergent and
water. When paint on the siding is peeling, it is particularly
unfortunate because the peeling cannot be safely removed, except by
washing, which is not very effective.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am filling the open stud walls on my house with insulation.
The walls are uneven so I am furring out the studs so the final
wall finish will, indeed, be even. With the new wall furred out a
little, the electric switches and outlet boxes will be indented.
How can I bring them flush with the wall? Incidentally, can I cover
the wires in the walls with insulation?
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD BODURTHA, Plymouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You can cover wires in the walls with insulation. You are not
supposed to cover exposed wires in the attic floor, but it is done
in thousands of houses throughout the country without serious ill
effects. The danger if you do that is that the wires, covered with
insulation, will overheat and cause a fire.
</P>
<P>
   To correct the mystery of the indented outlet boxes, relocate
them to the proper position, since the wall finish is off anyway.
Or, put spacers behind the bolts that hold the outlet or switch
fixtures to the boxes; this will bring them out even with the wall,
so they can be covered properly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I spend my winters in Florida, summers in Nova Scotia. When
visiting my daughter's house in Framingham recently, I noticed
yellow jackets had gotten into the walls. My daughter and
son-in-law are not doing anything about it. They are coming in
under a 4-foot-wide soffit. Shouldn't they do something? Might they
be boring holes in the studs or something?
</P>
<P>
   M.A., Florida/Nova Scotia
</P>
<P>
   A. Your family doesn't have to do anything because there is
nothing to do, if the critters stay in the walls. The yellow
jackets are wasps, and they will die out in winter after eating all
kinds of bugs all summer long. Your family could seal the soffit to
prevent further invasion and to make you feel better. The wasps are
not drilling holes in the studs because they don't do that sort of
thing. The insect that drills holes in wood is a carpenter bee, and
even she (females drill holes to store their eggs in) would drill
holes in siding or outside trim.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house was built in 1955, with a few towel racks that seem
to have been put up with library paste. One small member of my
family actually pulled it off. How can we reinstall it?
</P>
<P>
   BEVERLY BRULE, Northborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Ah, yes, the collapsing towel racks. In those halcyon days of
building, anything went, and usually collapsed. Towel racks, toilet
paper holders, and other fixtures were put up with grout, which did
not hold as well as the thin-set mortar of today. It's a wonder
your rack lasted as long as it did.
</P>
<P>
   To reinstall it, scrape the old grout off the brackets as well
as the wall on which the bracket was applied. Apply an adhesive
caulk to the fixture brackets. It comes in a caulking cartridge for
use in a caulking gun, so it is easily applied to the fixture.
</P>
<P>
   Press firmly, and hold onto it for several minutes for it to
set. Left alone, it will sag. You have to be there for five minutes
or so, keeping it in position. Once it sets, though, it will hold
very well. An alternative way: Do the same as above with thin-set
mortar, which you have to mix yourself.
</P>

ONCE-SECRET PAPERS REVEAL CIA SECRETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Soviet empire collapsed and Mikhail
Gorbachev made his desperate, failed struggle to retain power, US
intelligence agencies dropped the ideological blinders that had
hindered them during the Reagan years and accurately predicted the
fall of Communism, newly-declassified CIA records show.
</P>
<P>
   The documents also tend to elevate Gorbachev's place as the
pivotal figure in the end of the Cold War and devalue the impact of
President Reagan's defense buildup as a force for change in the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary release of the records, formerly classified
``secret'' and ``top secret,'' was timed to coincide with a
conference at Texas A &AMP; M University that begins Friday (Nov. 19).
It is part of an ongoing effort by the CIA to rehabilitate its
public image _ badly bruised by the seeming failure of the
intelligence community to anticipate the tumult and change which
gripped the nation's principal Cold War adversary.
</P>
<P>
   What the documents reveal is that, while US intelligence
analysts were often surprised by the rapid pace of events, during
the Bush years the CIA correctly identified the forces that would
ultimately shatter the USSR.
</P>
<P>
   ``The USSR is in the midst of a historic transformation that
threatens to tear the country apart. The old Communist order is in
its death throes,'' said a CIA intelligence report called ``The
Deepening Crisis in the USSR: Prospects for the Next Year.'' The
report, a formal national intelligence estimate, was distributed to
the president and other US policymakers in November 1990, a year
before the empire's final breakup. ``The Soviet Union as we have
known it is finished.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's analysts accurately predicted that Soviet
hard-liners would launch a coup attempt, which would probably fail;
that the Soviet Union would break into ethnic states; that Boris
Yeltsin could emerge as Gorbachev's successor in a democratic
Russia, and that suppressed ethnic tensions could erupt into
warfare in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a conventional wisdom that the CIA and the
intelligence community got it wrong,'' said Lloyd D. Salvetti, the
director of the CIA's Center for the Study of Intelligence. The
newly declassified records, he said, show ``the assertions that CIA
got it blatantly wrong are unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of hundreds of pages of classified documents, most
of them from the years 1988-1991, is highly unusual so soon after
the world-shaking events they chronicle. It generally takes decades
before such sensitive records become public. But these newest
documents are not likely to end the debate over the CIA's
performance. The records do not silence critics who contend that
the agency overestimated Soviet strength in the 1980s and
underestimated _ until very near the end _ the historic changes
that led to the fall of Communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of their analysts did have it right,'' said Marshall
Goldman, a Russian studies expert and CIA critic from Harvard
University. ``But on the whole, the bottom line would not have led
you to believe the country was on the verge of collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   During Reagan's years in office, as the White House was leading
the crusade against the Soviet ``evil empire,'' and striving to
justify a huge increase in defense spending, the CIA's Cold War
mindset and hard-line leaders led analysts to play down the
emerging signs of weakness in the Soviet system and the possibility
that Gorbachev might bring about revolutionary change after he took
office in March 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony included with the newly released records, Douglas
MacEachin, the chief of Soviet analysis at the CIA, told Congress
in late 1988 that the agency ``never really looked at the Soviet
Union as a political entity in which there were factors building
which could lead to at least the initiation of political
transformation.'' The Cold War orthodoxy was too rigid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never would have been able to publish it anyway, quite
frankly. And had we done so, people would have been calling for my
head. And I wouldn't have published it,'' MacEachin testified. ``In
all honesty, had we said a week ago that Gorbachev might come to
the UN and offer a unilateral cut of 500,000 in the military, we
would have been told we were crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev's domestic and foreign policy initiatives ultimately
convinced President Bush and his advisers that a new era was at
hand. Bush, a former CIA director, called for a review of US
strategy after taking office in 1989 and encouraged the CIA
analysts to give him bolder interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   The agency did so _ at times to the discomfort of the
administration, which increasingly bet on Gorbachev as the key
player in US-Soviet relations. Resisting ``Gorbymania,'' the CIA
issued gloomy analyses of Gorbachev's ability to reform the
Communist system.
</P>
<P>
   The analytic works of some individual experts within the CIA
were particularly prescient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boris Yeltsin has become the archfoe of the old order and has
a good prospect of becoming the first popularly elected leader of
Russia in history,'' stated an April 1991 paper entitled ``The
Soviet Cauldron.'' The paper predicted how the remaining hard-line
Communists would launch a coup that was expected to fail because
``the number of troops that can be counted on to enforce repression
is limited (and) the cohesion of the participating forces would be
hard to sustain if, as is likely, the democrats refused to fade
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, on the eve of the failed August coup attempt
that led to the final breakup of the USSR, another intelligence
estimate, ``Implications of Alternative Soviet Futures,'' said,
``The USSR is in the midst of a revolution that probably will sweep
the Communist Party from power and reshape the country within the
five-year time frame of this estimate.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA was too conservative. The USSR dissolved and Gorbachev
was gone in less than six months. The US intelligence analysts
``could anticipate where things were going. It's the timing that is
not there,'' said Benjamin Fischer, the CIA historian who edited
the new batch of records for release.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Soviet Union is in crisis. While noting the potential for
turmoil . . . we underestimated how quickly it would develop,''
acknowledged another intelligence estimate, ``The Soviet System in
Crisis: Prospects for the Next Two Years,'' in November 1989.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a question of whether the CIA was sufficiently
clear in its emphasis. ``Yes, they said all the things one wishes
they had said,'' said Kirsten Lundberg, who wrote a groundbreaking
case study on the CIA and the Cold War for the John F. Kennedy
School of Government at Harvard in 1994. ``The difficulty is that
policy makers are busy people, and when things are qualified and
hedged they may not see the red flag. Did the CIA say it so
distinctively that those in the White House could see it?''
</P>
<P>
   Those caveats aside, the agency's papers show that the CIA in
the Bush years alerted US policy makers to the dangers of anarchy
or civil war; a military coup and the possible loss of control of
nuclear weapons as the Soviet system collapsed. Armed with that
information, the Bush administration was able to set and meet its
goal of helping the Soviets to a soft landing in which the USSR's
nuclear arsenal remained secure.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA was also on target when it came to analyzing the
post-Cold War landscape in Europe, especially tensions among the
Serbs, Bosnians and other ethnic groups. ``The possibility remains
of a relapse to authoritarianism, particularly in the Balkans,
where the lifting of Communist hegemony threatens to revive old
ethnic animositities, civil strife, and interstate tensions,''
warned an April 1990 report, ``The Future of Eastern Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The new documents should fuel the political debate over how much
credit Reagan gets for winning the Cold War, said George Edwards,
the director of the Center for Presidential Studies at Texas A &AMP; M
University, whose conference on the CIA's performance will run for
three days.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's admirers say that renewed US resolve, exemplified by
more defense spending in the early 1980s, was the stroke that
pushed a tottering Soviet system to its end. The CIA analyses,
however, tell a different story. They show that the USSR could have
survived another two decades had not Gorbachev ``unleashed forces
he didn't understand,'' said Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Soviet Union was willing to spend whatever it took to keep
up,'' said Edwards. ``There is no sign it was moving in fear of
American defense policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The restraint shown by Reagan in his second term, and Bush's
deft touch, Edwards said, were more important than the US defense
buildup because they gave Gorbachev the breathing room to try to
reform a corrupt system. Gorbachev failed, said Edwards, because
the stirrings in Eastern Europe and the Soviet republics for
political and economic freedom and nationalism were too strong to
be contained once the lid was off the box.

CONCERNS MOUNT OVER MBEKI'S RIGID STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ The signs were always there: Challenge Thabo
Mbeki on the wrong issue and face the wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, while still deputy president of South Africa, he
tried to block the final report of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission for being too critical of his African National Congress
party actions under the apartheid regime; he also attacked the
director of a respected local watchdog agency who warned that an
Mbeki administration would need ``closer and more demanding
democratic and human rights monitoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Five months into Mbeki's presidency, the concerns are growing.
Aloof and enigmatic, he has set a decidedly different tone from his
predecessor, Nelson Mandela. He has centralized power, surrounded
himself with tough-minded ministers and bullied public-sector
unions and the judiciary. The South Arican Human Rights Commission
warned last month ``of a deterioration in the human rights
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, a fight over possible dangers of the AIDS drug AZT has
triggered another clampdown on dissent. One health official faces
five disciplinary charges for publicly disagreeing with the
government's refusal to make the drug available to pregnant women,
sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mbeki and those around him are doing everything to stifle
dissent within democratic rules,'' said Steven Friedman of the
Center for Policy Studies here. ``The danger is that he is imposing
uniformity not because people are thrown in dungeons, but because
he is president of a party with almost 67 percent (majority in
parliament) and can narrow the space for political debate.''
</P>
<P>
   No one doubted that Mbeki would usher in a new era of politics,
and many pundits said he was the right man to correct the
overwhelming social imbalances left by apartheid. While Mandela
preached reconciliation, Mbeki talks the hard language of
transformation: whites have a debt to pay, corruption will not be
tolerated, crime will be punished.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a tougher kind of politics to pull South Africa out
of its past, but his government's actions over the past few months
have raised a question about whether Mbeki is trying to create a
new society by fostering the rule of law or by imposing the harsh
discipline of a liberation movement at war.
</P>
<P>
   Police have used tear gas in crackdowns on street hawkers in
Johannesburg and forced removals of urban squatters, recalling
images of state brutality under apartheid. Ministers and members of
parliament have attacked judges for not working hard enough or for
imposing controversial sentences, raising concerns about threats to
the independence of the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   In a rebuke that some observers said reflects the tone of the
new government, ANC National Chairman Mosiuoa Lekota lashed out at
trade unionists in August, saying their criticism of government
economic policies ``smacked of revolutionary indiscipline.''
Earlier this week, the ANC insisted the new board of directors of
the South African Broadcasting Corp., the nation's public radio and
television, include a close friend of Mbeki's, who said during the
interview for the post that he would always place the national
interest above free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Signals are coming from Mbeki himself. He handpicked the
premiers of the seven provinces where his party kept control in
June elections, sacking two ANC incumbents who had unrivaled
popular support. Both men had crossed Mbeki's path.
</P>
<P>
   When one of Mbeki's chosen replacements said publicly that lying
by politicians was justified, Mbeki refused to rebuke him openly.
Instead, he went on a tirade against a minor opposition party
during an address in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Such tactics aren't new. Last year, Wilmot James, then the
respected director of the Institute for Democracy in South Africa,
warned in a confidential letter to the Open Society Foundation that
Mbeki would have to be watched closely for infringements of
democratic principles. Mbeki got hold of the letter and unleashed
an attack on both James and the institute.
</P>
<P>
   The AZT affair has raised new worries. Last month, Mbeki said
his government would not provide the drug to HIV-positive women
because it might be toxic, despite numerous local and international
studies showing that it can safely reduce the transmission of the
AIDS virus from mother to child by as much as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's claim caught even his most senior health officials
off-guard, and it has stalled _ at least temporarily _ a nascent
effort to create a network of AIDS programs that included using AZT
and other antiretroviral drugs. For two days before Mbeki's
statement, HIV/AIDS officials had met to develop those programs and
other AIDS treament and prevention efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Contradicting the president's spokesman, Health Minister Manto
Tshabalala-Msimang said that Mbeki had not consulted her before he
spoke out on AZT.
</P>
<P>
   The AZT issue has cast doubt on Mbeki's commitment to fight
AIDS. With the fastest rising infection rates in the world,
southern Africa marks the epidemic's global epicenter.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time Mbeki has taken aim at AZT's
proponents. Earlier this year, while Mbeki was still deputy
president, a state physician in the Eastern Cape Province was
formally charged with five disciplinary counts for challenging
then-Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma's negative stance on AZT.
</P>
<P>
   The new administration has upheld those charges.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Felicia's Journey'' is a film that seems to have slipped from
what in this case is the over-stylized grasp of Atom Egoyan. It's
got some riveting things in it, including its two central
performances of characters who are meant to collide fatefully,
without ever really coming together. We pretty quickly sense that
there's something if not quite scary, then at least warningly awry
in the controlled walk and talk of Bob Hoskins's softly
perfectionist manager of a factory cafeteria in bleak, grimy
Birmingham. Hilditch is his name. He lives alone in a more than
ample cottage, where he shares a favorite fetish of filmmaker
Egoyan (although it's not in the film's source, William Trevor's
novel), namely linking to the past via TV.
</P>
<P>
   A man of carefully maintained routines, he plays and replays a
videocassette of an old TV cooking show of a French chef, a woman
with whom he had a more than casual association. Night after night,
he replays the cassette, meticulously prepares exquisite meals, and
eats them alone. TV cameras play another role in his life. Long
before we learn what that role is, Hoskins makes us feel on the
hairs on the backs of our necks the simmering rage he expresses so
well with bright eyes alone. Soon this man with his controlled,
murmuring speech has someone to address it to, Felicia, an Irish
girl just off the boat. If he's repressed, she's in a state of
advanced denial, having come to Birmingham to look for the young
man who got her pregnant. In love with him, she's convinced he
loves her.
</P>
<P>
   To get to him, she left the soft green terrain of County Cork
and an angry hard-line father, who's convinced the boyfriend didn't
work in a lawnmower factory, as he claimed, but was a British
soldier. So Felicia, an innocent on her own, is susceptible when
Hilditch rolls up alongside her in his little car and offers to
help in her search for the boyfriend and a bed-and-breakfast. What
she doesn't see, and we do, is the intensity in his gaze as he eyes
her in his rear-view mirror. Before long, Felicia has accepted this
mild-mannered, soft-spoken man's invitation to live under his roof.
The question, as we know but Felicia doesn't, is whether she'll
emerge alive as ``My Special Angel'' is heard on the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the game interesting, the character of a Bible-thumping
Jamaican evangelist played by Claire Benedict is introduced. She
gets to know Felicia just long enough to possibly start asking
questions, a circumstance Hilditch views with alarm when he meets
her. Our alarm, of course, precedes Hilditch's as it becomes clear
that Felicia has no idea she might be in danger.
</P>
<P>
   As played by newcomer Elaine Cassidy, Felicia is not without
resources as the increasingly disturbing interaction with Hilditch
proceeds. As a presence, the promising Cassidy holds her own with
Hoskins. Yet while suspense builds over which way the payoff will
break, the muted nature of the film begins to work against it,
draining it of the psychological tensions and dichotomies so
painstakingly set up. ``Felicia's Journey'' has more ambition than
the usual serial killer film, but curiously less urgency. While far
from dismissible, it's also far from Egoyan's best.

Y2K TELEFILM TOO DUMB TO BE SCARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
Y2K: THE MOVIE 
Starring: Ken Olin, Joe Morton, Ronny Cox, Kate Vernon 
Directed by:Dick Lowry 
On: NBC 
Time: Sunday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TV14 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may not be a bad thing, all of this Y2K worry. Justified or
merely a survivalist's wet dream, the fear of an infrastructural
apocalypse on the occasion of the year 2000 has served to remind us
of just how much faith we place in computer technology. Not that
computers are evil _ you won't find this worshipper dissing that
cash shrine known as the ATM _ but they do not make the human race
all-powerful and invulnerable, either. Assuming we suffer nothing
worse than annoying inconveniences, Y2K may be remembered as a big
old-fashioned lesson in humility.
</P>
<P>
   And so think of ``Y2K: The Movie,'' NBC's November sweeps
follow-up to ``Mary, Mother of Jesus,'' as a Post-it note there to
remind us of both the burden and the bliss of high tech. Because
that's about all this lousy disaster knockoff is good for, really.
As an end-of-the-world fantasy it's a smoking dud; as a suspense
thriller in which Ken Olin must stop a nuclear meltdown, it's as
heart-pounding as an episode of ``The Adventures of Jonny Quest'';
and as a family drama in which a teenage rebel learns that sneaking
out to party can have dire consequences, it's pure and utter bosh.
``Y2K'' is so TV-movie generic, it's more likely to raise concern
about the flimsiness of sweeps TV events than to intensify our
already subsiding doomsday fever.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the movie is a Cliff Notes of possible Y2K
catastrophes, from the small potatoes of malfunctioning bank
computers to the dangers of computerized prison doors and nuclear
annihilation. Olin plays Nick Cromwell, a Seattle systems failure
expert working for the government's ``Z2'' project to protect
America from the bug. From one of those fake, computer-lined,
post-``Star Trek'' control rooms, he and his team watch cluelessly
as midnight strikes around the world and the crisis spreads across
the time zones. First, a Navy plane loses its controls and goes
down in the Marshall Islands, then Paris goes dark, and not long
after that the entire Eastern Seaboard has a major power outage.
Boston makes a brief appearance in the movie, as the city that has
``lost 911,'' while New York has the distinction of becoming an
urban riot zone. It's creepy to watch all of Times Square go dark
at midnight, for sure, but the movie tacks on a feeble vignette
about a man proposing to his girlfriend as the ball drops.
</P>
<P>
   In the second hour, the plot narrows down to the tired-looking
Olin, who, preposterously, must save a Seattle nuclear plant from
exploding all by himself. Don't get too close to that reactor, Ken!
We also get more of his family, including his naughty daughter, who
goes to a bash where the music is so loud the kids can't hear the
evacuation siren. Olin's nuclear rescue and his family angst are
meant to put a human face on Y2K, but they are delivered in such a
cursory, far-fetched manner they make the emergency look
ridiculously small. There's even a scene in which Mom and her SUV
happen to stumble across the repentant daughter in the middle of
Seattle. Now that's realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe NBC subconsciously wanted ``Y2K'' to be crummy and
entirely unbelievable. The network has been criticized for airing
it by factions (the President's Council on the Year 2000
Conversion, the Edison Electric Institute, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency) that say it will fuel hysteria and create a run
on bottled water and Snickers bars at the market. And a better
movie, a tense TV event that throws us back into the chaos of the
Dark Ages, might have raised the temperature of alarm a bit. But
this silly go at a millennial nightmare doesn't lend much credence
to fear. It's as incendiary as a book of wet matches, and, true to
the ratings-grabbing spirit of the venture, the secondslong
commercials for it pack more of a wallop.

 &HT;    Slavery issue at the heart of secession
 &HT;    (Eds: Resends to fix missing words in 5th graf.)
 &HT;    By James L. Roark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In February 1861, Georgian Alexander Hamilton Stephens called
slavery the Confederacy's ``cornerstone.''
</P>
<P>
   As vice president of the Confederate States of America, he spoke
with some authority. The ``foundations are laid, its cornerstone
rests,'' he said, ``upon the great truth that the negro is not
equal to the white man; that slavery . . . is his natural and
normal condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet today, a significant number of Southerners deny that slavery
had much to do with Southern secession. They point to states'
rights, self-determination, liberty, protection of hearth and home,
everything but slavery. No historical event as vast as the creation
of a Southern nation can be explained in monocausal terms. But
there can be no doubt about the centrality of racial slavery to the
creation of the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no slavery, no Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern struggle to preserve slavery was as old as the
United States. In 1787, Southerners embedded slavery in the
Constitution. By the 1820s, Southerners had aggressively built the
largest slave society in the New World. As they raced westward,
they spread cotton, slavery and plantations halfway to the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Slaveless whites joined slaveholders in supporting slavery and
opposing black equality. As the antebellum Georgia legal scholar
Thomas R.R. Cobb observed, every white citizen of the South ``feels
that he belongs to an elevated class. It matters not that he is no
slaveholder; he is not of the inferior race; he is a freeborn
citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1850s witnessed rising sectional consciousness and hardening
sectional suspicion. Increasing numbers of whites in the South came
to believe that an abolitionized North was taking aim at slavery in
the South, despite the protections of the Constitution. Abraham
Lincoln's election without a single Southern electoral vote
convinced many more Southerners that they could no longer remain
Americans and protect slavery. As Catherine Edmonstron of North
Carolina declared, ``Union now means Conquest _ and Conquest,
Confiscation. So we go.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Southerners rejected secessionist logic. ``I consider
slavery much more secure in the Union than out of it if our people
were but wise,'' Stephens countered. White Southerners were united
in their determination to defend slavery but divided about whether
Lincoln's election made it necessary to secede. Only in South
Carolina did the ``fire eaters'' (insistent secessionists) win
easily. In every other state in the lower South, including Georgia,
the vote was close. But secession prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Confederate President Jefferson Davis argued that secession and
the war that followed were about Southern rights and liberties. But
precisely what rights and liberties? The right of Southerners to
own slaves; the liberty of Southerners to take slaves into national
territories; and the freedom of Southerners to quit a union that
jeopardized those rights and liberties.
</P>
<P>
   When the war came, white men across the South marched off to
protect the life they knew. They fought for home, family, freedom,
their land, racial supremacy and more. But the motives that
compelled individuals to fight Yankees from 1861 to 1865 can
obscure the purposes that brought the Confederacy into being. The
new nation owed its political existence to white Southerners'
determination to preserve slavery and the society they had built
upon it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Southerners who reject the argument for slavery's role in
the origins of the Confederacy claim that the Southern cause
enjoyed a ``rainbow coalition'' of supporters. They point to the
thousands of ``black Confederates,'' slaves who worked on the
fortifications, drove rebel wagons and nursed sick soldiers in
Southern hospitals. They also lift up the willingness of the
government in Richmond in the last weeks of the war to free some
slaves for military service.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, voluntary Confederates were almost entirely pale
skinned. After the Emancipation Proclamation of Jan. 1, 1863, put
the Union squarely on the side of freedom, 100,000 black
Southerners donned blue uniforms to fight a war of liberation. And
the Confederate government's desperate experiment with limited
black freedom generated little enthusiasm on the home front.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Edmondston responded that Southerners had ``hitherto
contended that slavery was Cuffee's (African-Americans') normal
condition, the very best position he could occupy, the one of all
others in which he was the happiest and to take him from that and
give him what we think misery in the place of it, is to put
ourselves in the wrong essentially.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' she cried. ``Freedom for whites, slavery for Negroes,
God has so ordained it!''
</P>
<P>
   An assessment of the role of slavery in the making of the
Confederacy does not necessarily answer all the questions that we
face about how we choose to remember the Southern nation, but it is
the starting place for reasonable discussion.
</P>

ONCE-SECRET PAPERS REVEAL CIA SECRETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Soviet empire collapsed and Mikhail
Gorbachev made his desperate, failed struggle to retain power, US
intelligence agencies dropped the ideological blinders that had
hindered them during the Reagan years and accurately predicted the
fall of Communism, newly-declassified CIA records show.
</P>
<P>
   The documents also tend to elevate Gorbachev's place as the
pivotal figure in the end of the Cold War and devalue the impact of
President Reagan's defense buildup as a force for change in the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary release of the records, formerly classified
``secret'' and ``top secret,'' was timed to coincide with a
conference at Texas A &AMP; M University that begins Friday (Nov. 19).
It is part of an ongoing effort by the CIA to rehabilitate its
public image _ badly bruised by the seeming failure of the
intelligence community to anticipate the tumult and change which
gripped the nation's principal Cold War adversary.
</P>
<P>
   What the documents reveal is that, while US intelligence
analysts were often surprised by the rapid pace of events, during
the Bush years the CIA correctly identified the forces that would
ultimately shatter the USSR.
</P>
<P>
   ``The USSR is in the midst of a historic transformation that
threatens to tear the country apart. The old Communist order is in
its death throes,'' said a CIA intelligence report called ``The
Deepening Crisis in the USSR: Prospects for the Next Year.'' The
report, a formal national intelligence estimate, was distributed to
the president and other US policymakers in November 1990, a year
before the empire's final breakup. ``The Soviet Union as we have
known it is finished.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's analysts accurately predicted that Soviet
hard-liners would launch a coup attempt, which would probably fail;
that the Soviet Union would break into ethnic states; that Boris
Yeltsin could emerge as Gorbachev's successor in a democratic
Russia, and that suppressed ethnic tensions could erupt into
warfare in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a conventional wisdom that the CIA and the
intelligence community got it wrong,'' said Lloyd D. Salvetti, the
director of the CIA's Center for the Study of Intelligence. The
newly declassified records, he said, show ``the assertions that CIA
got it blatantly wrong are unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of hundreds of pages of classified documents, most
of them from the years 1988-1991, is highly unusual so soon after
the world-shaking events they chronicle. It generally takes decades
before such sensitive records become public. But these newest
documents are not likely to end the debate over the CIA's
performance. The records do not silence critics who contend that
the agency overestimated Soviet strength in the 1980s and
underestimated _ until very near the end _ the historic changes
that led to the fall of Communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of their analysts did have it right,'' said Marshall
Goldman, a Russian studies expert and CIA critic from Harvard
University. ``But on the whole, the bottom line would not have led
you to believe the country was on the verge of collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   During Reagan's years in office, as the White House was leading
the crusade against the Soviet ``evil empire,'' and striving to
justify a huge increase in defense spending, the CIA's Cold War
mindset and hard-line leaders led analysts to play down the
emerging signs of weakness in the Soviet system and the possibility
that Gorbachev might bring about revolutionary change after he took
office in March 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony included with the newly released records, Douglas
MacEachin, the chief of Soviet analysis at the CIA, told Congress
in late 1988 that the agency ``never really looked at the Soviet
Union as a political entity in which there were factors building
which could lead to at least the initiation of political
transformation.'' The Cold War orthodoxy was too rigid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never would have been able to publish it anyway, quite
frankly. And had we done so, people would have been calling for my
head. And I wouldn't have published it,'' MacEachin testified. ``In
all honesty, had we said a week ago that Gorbachev might come to
the UN and offer a unilateral cut of 500,000 in the military, we
would have been told we were crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev's domestic and foreign policy initiatives ultimately
convinced President Bush and his advisers that a new era was at
hand. Bush, a former CIA director, called for a review of US
strategy after taking office in 1989 and encouraged the CIA
analysts to give him bolder interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   The agency did so _ at times to the discomfort of the
administration, which increasingly bet on Gorbachev as the key
player in US-Soviet relations. Resisting ``Gorbymania,'' the CIA
issued gloomy analyses of Gorbachev's ability to reform the
Communist system.
</P>
<P>
   The analytic works of some individual experts within the CIA
were particularly prescient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boris Yeltsin has become the archfoe of the old order and has
a good prospect of becoming the first popularly elected leader of
Russia in history,'' stated an April 1991 paper entitled ``The
Soviet Cauldron.'' The paper predicted how the remaining hard-line
Communists would launch a coup that was expected to fail because
``the number of troops that can be counted on to enforce repression
is limited (and) the cohesion of the participating forces would be
hard to sustain if, as is likely, the democrats refused to fade
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, on the eve of the failed August coup attempt
that led to the final breakup of the USSR, another intelligence
estimate, ``Implications of Alternative Soviet Futures,'' said,
``The USSR is in the midst of a revolution that probably will sweep
the Communist Party from power and reshape the country within the
five-year time frame of this estimate.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA was too conservative. The USSR dissolved and Gorbachev
was gone in less than six months. The US intelligence analysts
``could anticipate where things were going. It's the timing that is
not there,'' said Benjamin Fischer, the CIA historian who edited
the new batch of records for release.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Soviet Union is in crisis. While noting the potential for
turmoil . . . we underestimated how quickly it would develop,''
acknowledged another intelligence estimate, ``The Soviet System in
Crisis: Prospects for the Next Two Years,'' in November 1989.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a question of whether the CIA was sufficiently
clear in its emphasis. ``Yes, they said all the things one wishes
they had said,'' said Kirsten Lundberg, who wrote a groundbreaking
case study on the CIA and the Cold War for the John F. Kennedy
School of Government at Harvard in 1994. ``The difficulty is that
policy makers are busy people, and when things are qualified and
hedged they may not see the red flag. Did the CIA say it so
distinctively that those in the White House could see it?''
</P>
<P>
   Those caveats aside, the agency's papers show that the CIA in
the Bush years alerted US policy makers to the dangers of anarchy
or civil war; a military coup and the possible loss of control of
nuclear weapons as the Soviet system collapsed. Armed with that
information, the Bush administration was able to set and meet its
goal of helping the Soviets to a soft landing in which the USSR's
nuclear arsenal remained secure.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA was also on target when it came to analyzing the
post-Cold War landscape in Europe, especially tensions among the
Serbs, Bosnians and other ethnic groups. ``The possibility remains
of a relapse to authoritarianism, particularly in the Balkans,
where the lifting of Communist hegemony threatens to revive old
ethnic animositities, civil strife, and interstate tensions,''
warned an April 1990 report, ``The Future of Eastern Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The new documents should fuel the political debate over how much
credit Reagan gets for winning the Cold War, said George Edwards,
the director of the Center for Presidential Studies at Texas A &AMP; M
University, whose conference on the CIA's performance will run for
three days.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's admirers say that renewed US resolve, exemplified by
more defense spending in the early 1980s, was the stroke that
pushed a tottering Soviet system to its end. The CIA analyses,
however, tell a different story. They show that the USSR could have
survived another two decades had not Gorbachev ``unleashed forces
he didn't understand,'' said Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Soviet Union was willing to spend whatever it took to keep
up,'' said Edwards. ``There is no sign it was moving in fear of
American defense policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The restraint shown by Reagan in his second term, and Bush's
deft touch, Edwards said, were more important than the US defense
buildup because they gave Gorbachev the breathing room to try to
reform a corrupt system. Gorbachev failed, said Edwards, because
the stirrings in Eastern Europe and the Soviet republics for
political and economic freedom and nationalism were too strong to
be contained once the lid was off the box.

LAST NIGHT 
Written and directed by: Don McKellar 
Starring: McKellar, Sandra Oh, Callum Keith Rennie, Sarah Polley,

Rated: R (sexuality, language and brief violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given its subject _ the end of the world in six hours _ the
surprising thing about Don McKellar's debut film is the way it wins
us with its modesty. No killer asteroids here, much less
superheroes rocketing off to save the world. Just a series of
small, specific human events that in their unforced, cumulative way
touch us, and, perhaps even more improbably, sometimes amuse us
along the way. The modesty of gesture includes McKellar's central
performance in his own film. It's no vanity production. His
character, an architect named Patrick, simply wants to face the end
alone, in his apartment, sipping a glass of wine, following a final
dinner with his family.
</P>
<P>
   The family dinner makes us think the film is yet another
Canadian comedic take on Canada's reputation for politeness,
reasonableness, and civilized behavior, no matter what. As
Patrick's father says with a straight face, ``It's a test of our
values.'' Toronto is facing the apocalypse with the stiffest of
upper lips. The impending end is giving rise to a few fires,
pockets of unruly street behavior, a runner (Jackie Burroughs, all
sinew and muscle) announcing the countdown. But there are no real
explosions of craziness, unless you count David Cronenberg's gas
company executive issuing an announcement reassuring everyone that
there will indeed be gas until the end.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, TV drones on mindlessly and perhaps comfortingly,
with nine channels covering 500 would-be guitarists convened to
learn the chords of ``Taking Care of Business.'' Some want to go
out in a blaze of sex. This faction is represented by Callum Keith
Rennie's Craig, doing his best to act out a list of hitherto
unrealized sexual urges. One of them involves Genevieve Bujold's
teacher, who taught both Craig and Patrick French in high school,
maintaining her dignity right through a final fling. So does Tracy
Wright, as a secretary determined to lose her virginity.
</P>
<P>
   But the film is stolen, and driven, by Sandra Oh's character,
who all but collides with Patrick, dooming his wish for solitude.
What's touching is that although she plays a woman who at least
wants the satisfaction of controlling the way she and her husband
face the end, she can't get across town to join him at home, or
even reach him on the phone (amusingly, McKellar convinces us that
if everything has to go, at least cell phones will go, too). This
woman named Sandra who wants to be controlling, but allows emotion
to surface until her reserve vanishes entirely, draws Patrick into
an unforeseen finale to which he finds himself responding. Good
actor that he is, McKellar knows that performances usually work
better when things are kept small and specific. Extending this
outlook to a big subject, he makes ``Last Night'' work in
surprisingly disarming terms.

`SLEEPY HOLLOW' LOOKS GOOD, BUT ACTING IS HEADLESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
SLEEPY HOLLOW 
Directed by: Tim Burton 
Screenplay by: Andrew Kevin Walker (story: Washington Irving) 
Starring: Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael
Gambon, Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, Ian McDiarmid, Michael
Gough, Christopher Lee, Marc Pickering, Lisa Marie, Christopher
Walken, Richard Griffiths 
Running time: 93 minutes 
Rated: R (graphic horror violence and gore, and a scene of
sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow'' may be a film in which, as its ads say, heads
roll. But freshness and imagination do not. Tim Burton could sue
himself for the way he rips off ``The Nightmare Before Christmas''
and, to a lesser degree, ``Edward Scissorhands'' in rewriting
Washington Irving's classic piece of folkloric Americana about
Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman. Although ``Sleepy Hollow''
looks great, its triumphs are pretty much solely on the level of
craft and workmanship. It doesn't take long before you glumly
realize that we've been here before.
</P>
<P>
   The first reminder comes when Christopher Walken's Headless
Horseman shows up in a head that seems to have been borrowed from
Edward Scissorhands. Walken's angry rider suggests a grown Edward
on drugs, with teeth filed to points, but with that trademark black
bird's-nest fright wig unchanged. The deja vu continues when the
twisted tree from which the horseman zooms out of hell is a dead
ringer for the one that served as the logo for Burton's ``Nightmare
Before Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Depp gives it a game try as the revamped Ichabod Crane, a
New York City cop sent upstate to the afflicted, doom-ridden town
of Sleepy Hollow to solve the murders by decapitation. The grim
Horseman not only lops the heads off, letting them roll around like
loose footballs, he then spears them on his sword like maraschino
cherries on a toothpick and rides off with them. Obviously,
something has gone very wrong, and it's amusing for a few moments
to watch Depp's uptight Crane try to sort out the criminality with
a modern scientific arsenal of gadgets. Representing the cutting
edge of technology in 1799, when the action unfolds, they seem a
cross between Leonardo da Vinci and Rube Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   The actors, the male actors at least, suggest a series of
expensive windup dolls with the exception of the unfailingly
excellent Michael Gambon, as a rich landowner whose holdings
obviously give him something to worry about. Christina Ricci
continues to impress as she segues from child roles to a wider
range of young women, in this case something of a fairy princess
under a malignant spell, but spirited and luminous with romantic
passion all the same. The others are upstaged by the juicily
atmospheric and spooky forests and houses.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else _ and it isn't much else _ ``Sleepy Hollow'' is
a gorgeous screenful of period eye candy. Given a dumpster full of
money to spend on sets, Burton has spent it well. Doubtless they
will make a wonderful theme park attraction someday. But while
Burton's new film looks great, there's nothing very compelling
going on in it. Even its mystery _ obviously there's more afoot
than the angry ghost of a Hessian mercenary _ is so lazily
constructed that it becomes ridiculously easy to solve. For all the
visual impact of its Knickerbocker country gothic, ``Sleepy
Hollow'' finds both Tim Burton and Andrew Kevin Walker, who wrote
``Seven'' and ``Fight Club,'' hitting a creative dry patch.

DAVE MUSTAINE: SENSITIVE DUDE WITH A HARD ROCK EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; If you ever wondered what the link between rock 'n' roll and
professional wrestling was, Megadeth singer-guitarist Dave
Mustaine, whose group appeared in a video of ``Crush 'em'' with
wrestler Goldberg and action star Jean Claude Van Damme, has it
figured out: ``Rock, as you know, is about volume and testosterone
and libido and bombs and smoke and fire and . . . didn't I just
describe wrestling, too? They are so one-in-the-same; the
underlying soap opera is the same. Wrestlers try and portray
believabilty about their character _ they know some guy in a
trailer park in the middle of America believes it's real. Well,
some guy in a trailer park in the middle of America believes Ronnie
James Dio when he sings about dragons. The musician is still trying
to make what he's singing believable, whether it's real or not.
There are elements of reality and of farce; the rock 'n'
roll/wrestling juxtaposition is closer than anybody realizes.''
</P>
<P>
   Megadeth, though, is not as cartoonish as that. A multiplatinum
band launched in 1983 after Mustaine was booted from Metallica,
looks at the world and finds it harsh. It doesn't deal much in
fantasy. ``We try to make our lyrics a little more identifiable,''
says Mustaine. ``There's a little more meat and potatoes and less
pabulum.''
</P>
<P>
   Mustaine is no dummy. He thinks clearly and speaks with
conviction, joking ruefully that considering the plethora of drugs
he did when he was younger, he shouldn't have this many brain cells
functioning. That's part of who is he, too: recovering alcohol and
drug (heroin-cocaine-pot-pills) addict and a Christian. But, he
says, ``My personal spiritual belief is in Christianity, but I
don't tell anybody they need to do that. There's nothing worse than
a newly sober drunk or a newly born- again Christian or someone who
just learned his first lesson in martial arts.'' (Mustaine does
martial arts, too. And golf _ ``I'm a passionate golf ball hitter,
not a golf ball finder.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``What is rock 'n' roll? Rock 'n' roll is being
anti-establishment, anti-conformity. With everybody being pierced
and tattooed, smoking, doing drugs, humpin' around, what could be
more rock 'n' roll than being everything that's not?''
</P>
<P>
   Megadeth recently released its ninth studio album, ``Risk,''
which is already gold. ``Breadline,'' the third song being pushed
by the record label, was one of the most-added songs to rock radio
playlists last week. On the album, Megadeth continues down the
hard-but-melodic road the quartet embarked upon with 1997's
``Cryptic Writings.'' ``We're keeping the heavy edge and
incorporating melody,'' says Mustaine. ``We've only gotten more
knowledgable about writing melody. . . . I have an ability to take
the band from the garage to the listener.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still a fair amount of darkness, aggression, cacophony,
and anger in Megadeth's music. Does any of what he does contradict
Mustaine's religious beliefs?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a dichotomy with the music and our personal
lifestyle,'' Mustaine admits, ``but that allows us to have a
significant release on stage. It's like if a sword was exposed to
the elements, it would not be able to keep its sharp edge, so you
sheath it. The anger, energy, aggression that people see (in us) on
stage, we would not be able to keep that edge if we were trying to
act like everybody else (off stage). It's boring trying to be a
rock star every minute of the day. When I was living in LA, seeing
all these poseurs, and touring as much as I have, seeing dinosaur
bands and new bands, such wannabes, talentless, total phonies. When
you get up on stage and act like animals, it's to be expected;
you're delivering the goods. If you walk around like a jerk all the
time, it doesn't help the community of this type of music.''
</P>
<P>
   Of certain elements of rock culture, Mustaine says, ``Sex is
dangerous; the drugs are 10 times stronger than they've ever been.
Rock 'n' roll needs to be autonomous from those two things. A lot
of the young people don't look on these womanizers as being cool
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be the voice of a generation,'' he continues. ``Now,
I'm kind of like an elder statesman. I don't miss it at all. There
was unbelievable pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Mustaine, who was declared dead back in 1992 when he OD'd,
thinks God saved him and has a purpose for him: ``It's to be
good-natured and kind to young groups starting out, which we've
done with Sevendust, Coal Chamber, Machine Head, DDT,'' among
others.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Richard Thompson, in joke mode, says: ``Kenny G
walks into an elvator and says, `Wow! This place really rocks!' ''
. . . Whatever happened to Rubyhorse? Signed two years ago to
Interscope, the Ireland-to-Boston transplants have had two albums
worth of material rejected by the label _ they were supposed to
release a disc in early '98 _ and will be submitting more material.
. . . Hurricane Lenny is doing damage these days, but I wish there
was a heavy metal fan at the hurricane-naming National Weather
Service who might have named it Hurricane Lemmy, after Motorhead's
frontman. Now, that would be a match of fury and fury.

ROCKING BEYOND THE BORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rock en Espanol, the common term used to describe Cafe Tacuba,
is a woefully inadequate label. Formed 10 years ago by graphic
design students in the northern suburbs of Mexico City, Cafe Tacuba
is the audacious, eccentric, wildly artistic cousin in the
burgeoning rock en Espanol family. Barely out of their teens when
they got together in 1989, singer Ruben Albarran, guitarist Joselo
Rangel, his brother Quique (a bassist), and keyboardist/programmer
Emmanuel del Real, eschewed the usual prog-rock trappings of the
genre for techno and Europop. They revered British rock acts like
Prefab Sprout, Everything But The Girl, and the Smiths. They also
loved rancheros and boleros, sambas and ska, metal and distortion.
They were, above all, daring, inquisitive, and thoroughly
irreverent _ qualities that have defined Cafe Tacuba's
ground-breaking music throughout the decade.
</P>
<P>
   On its eponymous first album, released in 1992, Cafe Tacuba
(named after a local Mexico City restaurant that served food
influenced by both European and native cuisine) came up with a
sound that was as aggressively avant-garde as it was traditional.
The group's breakout album, 1994's sprawling ``Re,'' hot-wired mad
hybrids of punk and boleros, reggae and Tejanos, acid-funk and
indigenous chants. The 1996 follow-up, ``Avalancha de Exitos''
(Avalanche of Hits), was a collection of radical remakes of songs
from their youths.
</P>
<P>
   Cafe Tacuba performs at the Paradise on Tuesday in support of
its new album, ``Reves/Yosoy,'' which came out this summer. After a
bidding war that involved such industry mega-powers as Virgin and
Universal, Warner Bros. won the rights to the project _ one of the
first rock en Espanol albums to be released domestically by a major
American label. ``Reves/Yosoy'' is a two-CD set: One disc is filled
with minimalist instrumental works, the other with vocal-based
songs. But bassist Quique Rangel prefers to think of the set not as
a double album, but as the band's fourth and fifth recordings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1998, when we finished our tour for `Avalancha' and
gathered to see what was the next Cafe Tacuba step, we were
tired,'' Rangel says on the phone from the Walker Art Center in
Minneapolis, a stop on the band's current US tour. ``There were
strange relationships between us. We had to find another way to
approach music, to recover interest. So we changed the usual roles.
We didn't bring any songs to rehearsals, or ideas from the outside.
We brought field recordings of noises or sounds we wanted to
experiment with. We changed the usual instruments, and that's why
the vocalist didn't use his.''
</P>
<P>
   The result of Cafe Tacuba's free-style music therapy is the
``Reves'' (``Backwards'') disc: 12 elegant, skeletal tracks that
include snippets of found sounds, crackling percussion, a pair of
collaborations with the Kronos Quartet, and trance-like
investigations of texture and color. Not surprisingly, the record
label was reluctant to release an album of instrumentals. So Cafe
Tacuba recorded another dozen songs _ this time with words and
voices, verses and melodies _ and bundled the two as a package. The
discs are like night and day. ``We do think they're
complementary,'' Rangel says. ``We feel that they are the two faces
of Cafe Tacuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yosoy'' _ or, technically ``yo soy'' _ translates to ``I am.''
The title is also a palindrome, the band likes to point out; the
word retains its meaning when read backward. The self-reflection
and self-discovery implicit in the title also describes the music.
The collection is as aesthetically understated, as thoughtfully
conceived _ one could argue as mature _ as anything Cafe Tacuba has
done. ``I do think this is our most introspective album, '' Rangel
says. ``And I think that's related to the fact that we're not 20
years old anymore. At the beginning, Cafe Tacuba was not just a way
to express ourselves, but a way to find out who we are as young
Mexicans. In this search we have been very close to rock and roll,
to experimentation and electronics and samples, and also to our
roots in traditional sounds and instruments. Maybe in that search
we have been radical. Now maybe we have gotten to a point where the
blend is different. I don't know if we've found a style,'' Rangel
laughs. ``I would prefer not to think that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cafe Tacuba need not worry about becoming stuck in a style.
While there isn't a single insanely fused anthem that leaps off the
disc, ``Yosoy'' brims with endlessly adventurous pop. It's both
sweet and serrated, dreamy and squalling, deeply traditional and
fiercely cosmopolitan. Judging from the turnout at Cafe Tacuba's
live shows, these songs _ which are sung exclusively in Spanish and
reflect, Rangel points out, a distinctly Mexican experience _ are
beginning transcend language and culture barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel says that the band's audiences, which used to be almost
entirely Latin, are now an equal mix of Latins and Anglos. Indeed,
this album will undoubtedly be closely watched as an indicator of
whether Cafe Tacuba, and Latin rock in general, can cross over into
the American mainstream. Rangel, however, rejects the idea that the
popularity of mainstream Latin singers like Ricky Martin has
sparked interest in Cafe Tacuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our music is not in English. We don't live in the States.
There is a lot of experimentation in Cafe Tacuba. Opening minds,
that has been happening from a long time ago with projects like
Peter Gabriel's, and David Byrne's company,'' Rangel says,
referring to Byrne's Luaka Bop record label, home to a select group
of cutting-edge Latin and world artists. ``Gabriel and Byrne have
been interested in all music, and they have been developing a way
to show their own people another kind of music.''
</P>
<P>
   While modern Anglo influences figure prominently in Cafe
Tacuba's music _ Rangel says the band was listening to a lot of
Talk Talk and Devo while recording ``Reves/Yosoy'' _ the new
project was inspired by the band's hometown. ``Mexico City has 20
million people, with a lot of contrasts: socially, economically,
politically,'' says Rangel. ``We had a lot of information from the
outside, a lot of information from the inside. There is not one
Mexican culture, but lots of them living together in parallel, in
different layers. You can go deep into your roots and not be able
to see what's around you. I think we are trying to do both.
</P>
<P>
   That deep, abiding commitment to making avant-garde music
informed by hundred of years of tradition is at the heart of Cafe
Tacuba's art. Artistic integrity, it goes without saying, doesn't
neccessarily dovetail with mainstream success. Rangel is cautiously
optimistic about the band's chances of reaching a wide audience.
``I think this is a chance for people to listen to something
different than they're used to,'' he says. ``Language shouldn't be
a barrier dividing different, or maybe not so different, visions of
the world. If they don't get it, it's not their fault or our fault.
At least there was the intention to be open. To have an
experience.''

KORN RETURNS TO ITS BITTER OUTLOOK WITH `ISSUES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Listening to Korn is like putting your head in a meat grinder _
which, for Korn fans, is the beauty of it. Heavy, grinding guitars
create a sense of industrial chaos, while singer Jonathan Davis
wails over them with tales of misery and rage that make most of his
angst-ridden peers seem like total optimists.
</P>
<P>
   The formula has sparked multi-platinum sales and a reputation
for some of the fiercest mosh-crazed shows around. Whether on the
Family Values tour, at Woodstock '99, at Harlem's Apollo Theatre
(this past Monday), or at an expected date at the Worcester Centrum
Centre next spring, Korn prides itself on delivering one metallic
knockout blow after another.
</P>
<P>
   Korn's new album, ``Issues,'' released this week, is artier than
past efforts (yes, really), but just as angry. What's new are
several one-minute interludes that sound like darkly scary film
music, but Korn's lacerating world view remains intact on the
full-length songs that surround them. Korn's legions will love this
CD, even if it might not reach new fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want in life is to be happy,'' Davis sings in the
opening song, reminiscent of his prior cry of ``All I want to do is
live.'' But he's soon swept into the abyss again. On the second
song (and new single), ``Falling Away From Me,'' he barks and
bellows about how life's circumstances are ``beating me down into
the ground.'' Then on ``Trash,'' he spews invective around the
lines ``why do I have a conscience?'' and ``why do I have this
torment?'' That leads to ``4U,'' an uncharacteristic, dreamily Pink
Floyd-like tune where he resignedly sings, ``I'm about to break,
this is my fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it get any cheerier from there. But if you're a true
Korn fan, you don't expect it to.
</P>
<P>
   The slamming ``Wake Up'' combines shock-wave vocals and
head-splitting guitar slashes from Korn ax men James ``Munky''
Shaffer and Brian ``Head'' Welch. And there's no rest for the
squeamish in ``Hey Daddy'' (with Davis, the product of a divorced
family, screaming for his father's love), followed by the
pummelling ``No Way'' (``lately everything is gray'') and the
ironic ``Let's Get This Party Started,'' a story of ``constant
paranoia . . . everyone is still out to get me.''
</P>
<P>
   From a fan's perspective, this album's seriousness of sound and
purpose is an atonement for the occasional selling out that Korn
showed in the past year. The low points were the band's approving a
wimpy remix of ``Freak on a Leash'' (rock radio ate it up, but real
fans cringed at it) and then doing another bizarre remix of the
same song by incorporating dialogue and sound effects from the
film, ``The Blair Witch Project.'' Opportunism strikes again.
</P>
<P>
   The new album is a return to uncompromising, thunderclap form
(at least until more remixes come along to make the work palatable
to mainstream rock radio). There's less of a hip-hop influence and
less humor (Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst, a cool addition to the last
album, is nowhere to be found). But there's no letup in Korn's
brutal rallying cries to a lost generation that doesn't want to
take it anymore.

THE MANY FACES OF TOVAH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You gotta get rid of your lisp, Terri Sue,'' said the
director, ``or you're never going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in the summer of 1963 at the National Music Camp in
Interlochen, Michigan, when Terri Sue Feldshuh, newly turned a
teenager, won the small part of Hebe in a production of ``H.M.S.
Pinafore.'' Her sparkling personality, and her dimples, stole the
show right out from under the leads every time she was onstage. I
know; I was there.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Sue did lose that lateral lisp. As Tovah Feldshuh, she
went on to become a leading actress on Broadway, on television, and
in the movies. And she has kept up her singing through a series of
one-woman shows and cabaret appearances. This week-end, she brings
her one-woman show ``Tovah: Out of Her Mind'' to the Jewish Theatre
of New England. This show ran off-Broadway for 10 sold-out weeks in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent telephone conversation from her home in New York,
Feldshuh offered reassurance that those dimples are intact. ``Yes,
I've still got them. You know, the summers I spent at Interlochen
changed my life. I went in as a piano major. I always got into the
concerto competition finals, but I just couldn't win. But then I
got the part in `H.M.S. Pinafore,' and the next year I was the lead
in `Little Mary Sunshine.' I said to myself, `This has promise _
it's a lot better than fighting my way through Mendelssohn's
Concerto in G-Minor.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Feldshuh didn't remain in operetta very long, but Interlochen
moved her decisively in the direction of theater. She also made
lasting friendships. Between ages 13 and 15, she regularly visited
one of her summer pals in Washington, D.C., and met her older
brother, Andrew Levy, who was in prep school. She saw him
occasionally during his college and law school years, and in
February, 1976, she married him. ``Though Interlochen I found my
life's work, and, indirectly, my life's partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldshuh grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y., and attended public school
and Sarah Lawrence, which is where Terri Sue became Tovah. ``I fell
in love with a WASP who asked me, `What's a girl like you doing
named Terri Sue? They'd always called me Tovah in Sunday School, so
I changed my name, and it has brought me great luck.''
</P>
<P>
   From Sarah Lawrence, Feldshuh went to the Guthrie Theater in
Minneapolis on a McKnight fellowship. ``I held spears and
understudied all the size 7 girls like Diane Wiest and Roberta
Maxwell. I was in a production of `Cyrano de Bergerac' where I
played an actress, a poet, a food-seller and a nun. I had 14 lines,
wore a red dress and got picked up by an agent, and I was playing
the title role in `Yentl' on Broadway 18 months after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldshuh's other great Broadway success after ``Yentl'' was in
``Lend Me Tenor,'' for which she won her second Tony nomination and
her second Drama Desk Award. Other Broadway ventures were not so
lucky, although three of them brought her to Boston. Feldshuh was
in the musical version of the Guthrie production of ``Cyrano'' that
starred Christopher Plummer and played the Colonial Theatre. Later,
in 1979, she was here in the ill-fated ``Sarava!'' and, after that,
``Dreyfus in Rehearsal.'' She is still grateful for a rave review
from the dean of Boston critics, Eliot Norton: ``My mother could
have written it!''
</P>
<P>
   She has also enjoyed a long career in television, where she has
had continuing roles on ``Law and Order'' and ``Against the Law''
as well as specials like ``Holocaust,'' for which she won an Emmy
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to stage and television work, Feldshuh has appeared
in more than a dozen films (``Brewster's Millions,'' ``Daniel,''
``The Idolmaker,'' and others). ``I got this wonderful break two
years ago, when I was cast as a grandmother in `A Walk on the
Moon.' I convinced them to let me play her by showing them the fat
under my arm, and in order to avoid seeing any other body part,
they gave me the role! No, honey, it wasn't my first film _ but it
was my first hit. Since then I've finished three more features and
a short film.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, Feldshuh is concentrating on her cabaret
appearances and one-woman shows. She has several of them, including
evenings devoted to actress Tallulah Bankhead, acting teacher
Stella Adler, and fashion designer Diana Vreeland. Her Bankhead
piece, ``Southern Comfort,'' opens in New York's Theater in the
Park Dec. 4. ``Dial 718-760-0064 for tickets, and I'm not kidding;
that's the number.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tovah: Out of Her Mind'' is a modular show; by now there are
about 35 characters, of which Feldshuh will do 12 or 13 in any
given 85-minute show. ``I created this show out of my love for Lily
Tomlin and Bette Midler, both of whom I admire so much, and Bette
has become a fond acquantance. Along with Meryl Streep, they are
the greatest performers I know. I looked at Lily Tomlin and Bette
Midler working and I said, `I can do something like that.' I love
transformational work and I love to sing _ and this is so much
cheaper than therapy! So I began to create my characters. The
youngest of them is 8-year-old Molly Kelly Kugelberg, the child of
a mixed marriage, and the oldest is Grandma Ada from the Bronx, who
dreamed of being in the Russian theater. My own Grandmother Ada was
British and my grandfather was Russian _ this character is her
story, with his accent!''
</P>
<P>
   Feldshuh keeps herself in trim by making sure to get enough
sleep, by taking yoga classes twice a week, and staying in regular
touch with her voice teacher. ``I love to sing _ and I have even
sung full shows without any voice. If the soul of the performer is
there, the audience will forgive anyting. If you go on without
that, they will forgive nothing. I think there is a lesson for
everyone in a show like `Tovah: Out of Her Mind.' If an actor can
go on and play 12 or 13 people, accurately and movingly, just think
what you can do for yourself, if you really want to. If you want to
lose 5 pounds, go for it! Life is loaded with possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   These days Feldshuh is concentrating on cabaret appearances and
her one-woman shows. ``I am a mommy with two children, and this is
not a time for me to be working eight shows a week. To appear in
the small concert business, playing short runs in houses seating
about 500, is marvelous for me _ and efficient financially. I feel
very strongly that everyone is entitled to make a living, even an
actor! I did all the workshops for `Ragtime' but could not go with
it to Broadway. My daughter is 11, a dancer in the New York City
Ballet school, and my son is in a college-prep program. I will be
darned if I am not going to be around to help them _ if you can't
bring up your own kids, you ain't worth nothing. The two great
unconflicted loves of my life are my children, and my husband,
Andrew Harris Levy, attorney. In the words of the Talmud, through
our children, I can pass a bright torch along and help to heal the
planet.''

BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, BSO LOOKS FOR NEW MUSIC DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The election of a new pope is a public proceeding
compared to the secrecy that surrounds the selection of a new music
director for a major American orchestra. But in Rome, the public
can at least look for white smoke. In America, one has to wait for
the press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Seiji Ozawa's resignation last summer caught the Boston Symphony
Orchestra and its staff by surprise _ just as the offer to head the
Vienna State Opera caught Ozawa by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, when something like this happened, the
executive director of an orchestra would get on the phone with the
major New York managements and cut a deal. But the process can't
work that way anymore. In 1980, the management and board of the
Cincinnati Symphony appointed a music director, Michael Gielen, who
had never conducted the orchestra. Gielen's six-year tenure turned
out to be distinguished, but the initial outcry from the players,
who felt they had been disenfranchised, assured that American
orchestral musicians would never again be left out of the loop in
the selection process.
</P>
<P>
   All participants in the BSO's current search for a music
director have agreed there will be no public discussion about the
search while the process is going on.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, BSO managing director Mark Volpe agreed to talk
about the mechanics of the search, provided there was no discussion
of any specific conductors, candidates, or names.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a provision of our master agreement with the
orchestra,'' Volpe says, ``that a search committee will be created
in the event that there is a vacancy for the position of music
director or Pops conductor. On the committee there is equal
representation of musicians and members of the trustees or
overseers, six from each group, along with three staff members,
myself, artistic administrator Anthony Fogg, and orchestra manager
Ray Wellbaum; the president of the board, Nicholas T. Zervas is the
ex officio chairman of the committee. The committee members from
the orchestra are elected by the orchestra; the others are
appointed. The committee's function is advisory _ that is, it is
charged with making a recommendation, or several recommendations,
to the board of trustees, which has the ultimate responsibility and
authority to engage the next music director. Since all the internal
constituencies of the institution are represented on the committee,
I would be hard pressed to imagine a scenario where the board would
overrule the collective wisdom of the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This represents a considerable change from the time of Ozawa's
selection. ``You have to remember,'' Volpe says, ``that this
orchestra hasn't gone through this process in 25 years, and it is a
new experience for everyone on the committee except for Tony Fogg
and me. We are operating in a more democratic time, and the players
have more say in this than they did 25 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The search committee will not operate in the absence of detailed
information. So far, the pool of candidates is necessarily
restricted to conductors who have appeared with the orchestra,
which includes a substantial representation of the world's leading
maestri, including Bernard Haitink, Andre Previn, James Levine,
James Conlon, Christoph Eschenbach, James DePreist, Robert Spano,
Roberto Abbado, Andrew Davis, and others. Files are maintained on
every guest conductor and soloist with the BSO. On a voluntary
basis, members of the orchestra can fill out evaluation forms and
submit them to the orchestra's artistic advisory committee, which
in turn presents them to management and staff, which considers the
response of the players when it comes to making decisions about
reengagement.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, there are some prominent conductors who have never
conducted the BSO _ Riccardo Chailly, Paul Daniel, Daniele Gatti,
Daniel Harding, Eliahu Inbal, Armin Jordan, Carlos Kleiber, Andrew
Litton, Sir Charles Mackerras, Riccardo Muti, Antonio Pappano,
Michel Plasson, Jukka-Pekka Saraste, Christian Thielemann, to pluck
some names from the hat. No one will be surprised if some of these
conductors should appear on future schedules. One might also
mention the new generation of female conductors who have not yet
made their way to the BSO podium _ Marin Alsop, Sian Edwards, Jane
Glover, Anne Manson, and Simone Young. (Volpe says women are
represented on the search committee).
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that there are notable conductors who have not
appeared with the orchestra recently and whose chemistry with the
players might need to be rechecked _ John Eliot Gardiner, Marek
Janowski, Neeme Jarvi, Kent Nagano, Christoph Perick, Esa-Pekka
Salonen, Michael Tilson Thomas, and David Zinman among others.
</P>
<P>
   Orchestral schedules are set so far in advance that it was
impossible to shoehorn anybody new into the current season, except
in the case of last-minute substitutions. A lot of attention will
therefore focus on the Tanglewood and Symphony Hall schedules for
this season and next. When this observation was made to Volpe, he
cautioned that some guest conductors had been engaged before
Ozawa's resignation, and therefore without any forethought about
the search for a music director.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe also refused to pin the search down to a timetable. Ozawa
is scheduled to leave following the Tanglewood season in 2002.
Obviously, it would be desirable to have someone new in place by
then, but Volpe says, ``It is incumbent upon all of us to get the
very best person, and if that takes a little more time, we will
take it. Fortunately, we have very good preexisting relationships
with a number of the best conductors, which will keep the orchestra
in capable hands. We have extended Bernard Haitink's contract as
principal guest conductor, and he will lead a tour by the orchestra
in Seiji's penultimate season.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe looked horrified when asked if the kinds of issues that
kept the Boston Symphony music directorship from being offered to
Leonard Bernstein 50 years ago were still relevant. Bernstein was
too young, too Jewish, too gay, and too American for the job. ``It
is against the law for me to say anything about age or race or sex
or sexual preference,'' Volpe said. ``But I believe times have
changed, and none of those issues should weigh in our
deliberations.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra holds some very high cards as it begins its
search. Boston is a city musicians like to live in. The orchestra
has some personnel problems _ what orchestra doesn't? _ but
contrary to some published opinion, it is in good technical shape.
It plays in America's best concert hall, which it owns. It has its
own summer festival, on a beautiful estate that it also owns; the
festival is so popular that it can afford more adventurous
programming than most of its American rivals. The orchestra is
financially sound _ it is possibly the most stable orchestra in the
world, fiscally speaking, thanks to the generosity of its board and
donors and their enlightened predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Through the Tanglewood Music Center, the music director of the
Boston Symphony Orchestra has the opportunity to exercise a
decisive influence on the next generations of American and
international musical life. Some music directors have been very
involved in the life of the center, some scarcely at all; Ozawa has
been both. Clearly it is a more desirable situation when the music
director has a strong sense of educational mission.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the Symphony Hall season, Tanglewood, and the
Tanglewood Music Center makes the BSO music directorship one of the
most demanding and time-consuming in the world. It is not a job for
a part-timer, and full-time music directorships are not popular
among conductors anymore; they prefer to come in for a few weeks
here and there. James Levine at the Metropolitan Opera may be the
only old-fashioned music director active anywhere; the results
ought to speak for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The BSO music directorship presents many challenges and
opportunities, and it can also bestow many advantages. It should go
to someone who approaches it with a sense of mission, and who can
offer significant commitment to it. If the chemistry happens, if
the conductor's collaboration with the orchestra aspires to,
attains, and maintains the highest standards of adventure and
achievement, including zealous advocacy of new music and American
music in particular, then every other measure of success will
inevitably follow _ recordings, tours, ticket sales, significant
donations, and all the rest of it, even good reviews in New York.
But the most important, the all-important, criterion must be the
artistic excitement that is created by artistic stature.

BUSH DEALS WITH FAME AND FORTUNE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: Not for use before Sunday, Nov. 21) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bush singer-guitarist Gavin Rossdale doesn't see anything wrong
with being beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, it would be one thing if I had an eye in the center of
my forehead,'' he drawls. ``But I don't see anything wrong with
being attractive to someone. Human attraction is a positive thing.
God makes you look a certain way. What bothers me is when my looks
are used as a weapon against our music.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossdale has seen it happen before. Often dismissed as just
another ``pretty boy'' frontman, the brooding Londoner can't
understand why Bush just can't seem to get a break from the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've written every song we've ever recorded,'' he insists.
``Plus, I don't think I'm all that handsome. I spent lots of years
as a musician and nobody gave a (darn) if I lived or died. It's
prejudice. If they're going to attack me about my looks, how can I
control it?''
</P>
<P>
   The mostly teen-age fans certainly aren't complaining. Bush has
sold more than 14 million copies of its first two albums, ``Sixteen
Stone'' and ``Razorblade Suitcase,'' and the quartet is a staple of
the modern-rock radio format.
</P>
<P>
   Rossdale, 32, says he understands why his band is so frequently
attacked by the media. Becoming pop stars was not the band's
intention, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know this was gonna happen, and it's not my fault,''
he said during a recent visit to Los Angeles. ``You have to go ask
all the people who buy our albums. I know that we'd be getting an
easier time of it if we'd sold a fifth of all those records.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's latest disc, ``The Science of Things''
(Trauma/Interscope), wasn't the out-of-the-box smash many expected.
The disc, which spawned the current KROQ-FM (106.7) hit ``The
Chemicals Between Us,'' peaked at No. 11 on the Billboard 200 and
recently dropped to No. 24.
</P>
<P>
   But Rossdale says the subject matter of the new album demands
closer inspection and may not be instantly accessible to listeners
in the way ``Sixteen Stone'' and ``Razorblade Suitcase'' were.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's previous albums produced such hits as ``Everything Zen,''
``Little Things,'' ``Glycerine'' and ``Swallowed'' _ songs dealing
with isolation, mortality and love.
</P>
<P>
   Rossdale says ``The Science of Things'' discusses ``the nature
of things, the way people are.''
</P>
<P>
   To write the record, Rossdale moved into a rented house
overlooking a lake on the west coast of Ireland. He says the stint
allowed him to uncover issues close to his heart.
</P>
<P>
   He explains the track ``Letting the Cables Sleep'' is about
friends or lovers unable to speak to each other, and the song was
inspired by a friend with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't bring himself to tell anyone for six months and
went through hell by himself,'' Rossdale says. ``It's very hard to
find out that you weren't there for your friends. You just feel sad
and helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   The new disc also contains an ode to slain Playboy Playmate
Dorothy Stratten, titled ``Dead Meat.'' Rossdale says he liked the
idea of ``turning the tables and having someone that had been
exploited come back and seek revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossdale's girlfriend, No Doubt chanteuse Gwen Stefani, dropped
by sessions for ``The Science of Things'' to add back-up vocals to
the track ``Space Travel.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the state of their relationship, Rossdale is
suddenly tongue-tied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dunno,'' he says. ``I'm not sure. It's all too confusing.
All I want to talk about is my record right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush _ which also includes guitarist Nigel Pulsford, bassist
Dave Parsons and drummer Robin Goodridge _ is set to appear at
KROQ's Almost Acoustic Christmas event Dec. 11 at the Anaheim Pond.
Also on the bill are Foo Fighters, Save Ferris, 311 and Blink-182.
Details for the performance are still under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in London in 1992 and roundly ignored at home, Bush
targeted America, where fans quickly embraced the group's debut,
``Sixteen Stone,'' which sold more than 8 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, labeled the band ``Nirvana wanna-bes'' and
wrote the Brit export as a grunge rip-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had nothing to do with what was going on at the time in
Britain,'' Rossdale says. ``We didn't write songs to be commercial
and have hits. We just wanted to start an exciting rock band. And,
in fact, everyone got our biggest influence all wrong. It wasn't
Nirvana _ it was the Pixies!''

JENNY MCCARTHY BREAKING FREE FROM EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: Not for use before Sunday, Nov. 21) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'd think if Jenny McCarthy were serious about shaking off her
Playboy centerfold image, she could have tried harder than
accepting the role of a Nevada bordello prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   But McCarthy doesn't see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   When the script for ``Diamonds'' first came around, her agent
(now former agent) rejected it without even informing the actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was back-doored and it went through my manager,'' McCarthy
said. ``I read it once and said, `I'm doing it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because they just heard it was the role of a
prostitute they said absolutely not, whereas I learned to read
everything. And reading it, I knew that it was going to be done
classy and somewhat adorable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Diamonds,'' opening Dec. 10, marks Kirk Douglas' return to
acting after a stroke. He plays a feisty former boxer on a road
trip with his son (Dan Aykroyd) and grandson (Corbin Allred) in
search of some gems a Reno mobster stashed for him decades earlier.
</P>
<P>
   One night, when all three are feeling randy, they go to a
brothel. McCarthy plays Sugar, the girl chosen by the 15-year-old
grandson for his sexual initiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a different role for me,'' she said. If she were
typecast, she said, she would have been assigned the comedic part
of Tiffany, who tortures Aykroyd with her irritating laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so glad that they thought of me for this part,''
McCarthy said. ``I got to tone it down and be actually real, and I
was really dying to show that, even if it was for that much, and
they gave me that break.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the point of a small supporting role in a nice
Miramax film has not been a breeze for 26-year-old McCarthy, who
gestured broadly, laughed and mugged her way through her life
story. She made her first attempts at show biz through modeling and
commercial agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody would take me. I had a Chicago accent and big blond
hair and I was overweight, and overcoming that was hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, out of desperation, she posed nude for Playboy, which she
looks back on as ``the best acting job'' of her life. ``It was the
hardest thing I've ever had to do because inside I'm not that. But
I was so broke. I was $20,000 in debt and I needed to get to
Hollywood so I could pursue acting. This was the only way.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I got the money and thought, OK, it's going to be easy now.
Now I'm in Hollywood, I can just break away from Playboy and go out
and do it. Wrong! It was very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Because she had been a Playmate, it took 10 calls from her agent
to persuade MTV to let her audition for the TV personality job that
made her famous. After she got that job, McCarthy said she was seen
in the entertainment industry as ``MTV Girl,'' a brash,
over-the-top, pop-culture icon. Meanwhile, a large segment of the
public still perceived her as the sultry vamp in the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was a brief stint on network TV, an NBC sitcom titled
``Jenny'' that was canceled after a few weeks in the wake of
scathing reviews and poor ratings.
</P>
<P>
   After that, she says, she decided to be ``really quiet,'' to
keep a lower profile and wait for the right projects. ``People
still come up to me and say, `I loved you on MTV.' So I decided to
be extremely picky and pick the tiniest little things just to keep
my name out there, to keep the tension a little bit alive, but not
to be so outspoken and out there as a personality.''
</P>
<P>
   She's definitely not the same old Jenny on the outside. She
showed up for this Beverly Hills interview with her hair dyed dark
brown and cut chin length. It's a change she made for a dramatic
lead role in ``White Bread,'' which finished shooting in October,
and she says she intends to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blondes don't have more fun, I'll tell you,'' said McCarthy,
who confesses to having light brown hair naturally. ``People
actually talk to me differently. It's definitely more of a respect
issue _ they listen more to what I say. I don't have to keep
repeating myself. (Blond hair) is striking, it's head turning, and
I find that I don't get as much attention, but that is the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she doesn't need to turn heads anymore in her
personal life. She met director John Asher on the set of
``Diamonds,'' declared her love for him the following day and
became engaged to him two weeks later. They were married Sept. 11.
(Asher, by they way, says he loves McCarthy's new hair color.)
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether her new look will overshadow that
earlier persona of the bleached blonde with the bedroom hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you read articles that say `Jenny McCarthy, former
Playmate,' you're going, `I've done some more accomplishments,'''
she said. ``It's still a struggle. I think with time and with work
and with age, people will start looking at my work and, hopefully,
get past that.''
</P>
<P>
   How will she know when she has ``arrived''?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I'll ever say I have arrived,'' she said. ``When
the struggle part's over is when I'm holding that Academy Award. I
guess it would be the work that I did that was that A-plus, where
people everywhere go, `Wow.' And I guess the statue isn't
necessarily a piece of gold, it's the respect. When I read every
article that says that, I'll be ...''
</P>
<P>
   The talkative Jenny McCarthy ran out of words.

   ANESTHETISTS _ WASHINGTON _ The Army surgeon general is
reviewing a proposal to allow specially-trained nurses to direct
the use of anesthesia to some patients at Army hospitals. A draft
of the proposal states that certified registered nurse-anesthetists
will be supervised only when giving the sleep inducing drugs to
children less than 24 months old and to more seriously ill adults.
Currently, Army policy requires the nurses to be supervised by
physician anesthesiologists when putting patients to sleep. If
approved, the new policy would follow a similar change instituted
recently at the National Naval Medical Center. In a statement
released Friday, the Navy denied statements by anestheologists that
the Bethesda hospital would continue to provide anesthesiologist
supervision for high government officials and other ``VIPs'' who
are treated there. (Nesmith, Cox News Service)

restaurants. The radical fringes of the 8 million Uighurs continue
waging a hit-and-run campaign of violence from the base of an
underground Islamic party, which is Beijing's number one priority
to destroy. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox News Service) WITH PHOTOS and

   CHRISTIANITY-ASIA _ SEOUL, South Korea _ This region of the
world has been one of the more painful ones for Christians and
their beliefs. They face persecution everywhere. Vietnamese police
have raided a number of Christian gatherings across the country in
recent months, detaining and harassing scores of worshippers.
Vietnam's Christian population is unclear, although the country of
79 million people has 8 million Catholics, the largest community in
Southeast Asia outside the Philippines. But in secular South Korea,
the number is growing and becoming one of the most active churches
in East Asia. Developing. (Kirk, Cox News Service)

   CHRISTIANITY-LATAM _ MEXICO CITY _ In this fervently Catholic
country, they build shrines by the thousands and crawl on their
knees to honor the Virgin Mary at her own special basilica. The
main purpose of the pope's trip to Mexico earlier this year _ his
fourth trip to this country _ was to address challenges to the
Catholic Church in the Americas, the most Catholic region in the
world. Mexico is considered a geographic powerhouse for the Vatican
because it is a bridge between South America and North America,
where the church is concerned about the spread of materialism and
secularism. And Mexico, whose Catholic population is second only to
Brazil in number, is home to the Basilica of the Virgin of
Guadalupe, the second-most visited Catholic sanctuary in the world
after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

   ANESTHETISTS _ WASHINGTON _ The Army surgeon general is
reviewing a proposal to allow specially-trained nurses to direct
the use of anesthesia to some patients at Army hospitals. A draft
of the proposal states that certified registered nurse-anesthetists
will be supervised only when giving the sleep inducing drugs to
children less than 24 months old and to more seriously ill adults.
Currently, Army policy requires the nurses to be supervised by
physician anesthesiologists when putting patients to sleep. If
approved, the new policy would follow a similar change instituted
recently at the National Naval Medical Center. In a statement
released Friday, the Navy denied statements by anestheologists that
the Bethesda hospital would continue to provide anesthesiologist
supervision for high government officials and other ``VIPs'' who
are treated there. (Nesmith, Cox News Service)

two hours to ``real'' time instead of Beijing time, as the Chinese
nearly 2,000 miles away have dictated, or by boycotting Chinese

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Once used to only light the way, candles have
flickered their way onto many a dining table and almost every room
and decorating scheme.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking just one candle per room, but clusters of them
in various shapes. Many of these luxurious wax confections also
bear a scent, from the ever-popular vanilla to evergreen, spice,
fruit and fresh botanicals.
</P>
<P>
   Candles are used in seven out of 10 U.S. households, according
to the National Candle Association. They come in all sizes and
shapes, from tapers, straight-sided dinner candles, spirals and
columns to votives, wax-filled containers and novelties.
</P>
<P>
   Candle retail sales in the United States for 1999 are projected
at $2.3 billion, not including accessories.
</P>
<P>
   The colors and scents of candles can evoke memories of special
places and events. But not all candles are created equal.
</P>
<P>
   Inexpensive candles can often smoke, are less fragrant and have
a shorter burn time than quality candles. With some candles the
fragrance is evident even if the candle isn't burning. The best way
to smell a fragrant candle is from the bottom, as the wax tends to
oxidize at the top.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Candle Association, based in
Washington, D.C., consumers are increasingly choosing candles for
their fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   Although scented candles are soothing, they shouldn't be
confused with aromatherapy. Most of what is being referred to as
aromatherapy _ whether for candles or bath products _ is actually
aroma-chology, according to Marianne McDermott, executive vice
president of the National Candle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aroma-chology deals only with the psychological effects
achieved through the use of ambient odors, synthetic or natural,''
such as scented candles, McDermott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aromatherapy, on the other hand, deals with the physiological
or therapeutic effects of natural essential oils only.'' These oils
are absorbed by massage, eating or breathing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a misconception among consumers that most fragranced
candles are aromatherapy candles,'' McDermott said. ``The truth is
that most fragranced candles available to consumers do not contain
essential oils, and those that do may not have enough to produce
the specific treatment of the various mental and physical disorders
they purport to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Men and women react to smells differently. Some scents may even
cause irritation or breathing difficulty. However, ``there's no
known connection between fragrant candles and allergies,'' said Dr.
James M. DeMasi, a specialist in pediatric and adult allergies in
Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone should experience a symptom, it's just a reflection
of personal sensitivity. It would be like people having a reaction
to perfume inserts in magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Hedrick, vice president of Regulatory Affairs and
Fragrance Safety for the fragrance manufacturer Belmay Inc. in
Yonkers, said some people will have some sort of allergic reaction
to fragrances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fragrance mainly comes off of the hot wax pool,'' said
Hedrick, a former board member for the National Candle Association.
``The level of smell depends on the amount of fragrance added to
the candle.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though they smell good, fragrant candles should be used
with
</P>
<P>
   the same care as all candles. According to the National Fire
Protection Agency, candle fires account for 2.4 percent of all
fires and result in 6 percent of total injuries from fires and 3
percent of all fatalities from fires.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Fire Incident Reporting System, nearly
85 percent of the candle fires were started because of consumer
misuse of the product.
</P>
<P>
   To help educate consumers about proper candle use, many U.S.
candle manufacturers include directions and warning labels.
</P>
<P>
   Always put candles on or in a fireproof surface or holder. The
dyes in some pillar candles can transfer to fabric or furniture
they may touch, even if they are not burning.
</P>
<P>
   The National Candle Association offers a variety of tips that
will help you get the best performance and enjoyment from candles:
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't burn candles for more than four hours at a time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Extinguish taper or pillar candles when they get within 2
inches of their holders or decorations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stop using container candles when one-half inch of wax
remains.
</P>
<P>
   _ Always use containers that have been made for candle use.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never leave candles unattended.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid burning candles near combustible materials.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep matches, wick trimmings and foreign objects out of the
candle wax.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't place candles near vents or drafts, to prevent rapid and
uneven burning and excessive dripping.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep candles out of reach of children and pets.

DEFINITIONS FOR THE KITCHEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It happens at least twice a week. We answer the phone and
someone says, ``I have a stupid question for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is never stupid. They just want to know what
something is. They want a definition for some item or technique
that isn't on the front burner of cooking terms. It's frequently an
ethnic ingredient or a culinary phrase that has someone befuddled.
Sometimes it's a trendy phrase that keeps showing up on restaurant
menus but never in the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   So once a year or so, we'll pull together a list of questions
we've gotten from callers. And those of you who thought the
question was too stupid to ask will have the answer as well.
</P>
<P>
   INGREDIENTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Brown sauce: Any one of a number of sauces made from meat
stock and browned vegetables. Brown sauce forms the basis of a
number of other sauces, including demi-glace. If a recipe calls for
``brown sauce,'' look for demi-glace mix in the grocery store and
add a little extra water.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgur [BUHL-guhr]: Wheat kernels that have been steamed, dried
and crushed. Though frequently mistaken for cracked wheat, the two
are not the same. Bulgur has a tender, chewy texture. Look for it
in the cereal or health-food sections of area grocery stores. Use
it in salads, meat and vegetable dishes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Couscous [KOOS-koos]: Not a grain but granular semolina. Fast
and easy to cook, this staple of North African cuisine can be mixed
with milk and served like oatmeal, mixed with dried fruit, herbs or
vegetables and served like rice or used to stuff meats and
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   _ Demi-glace [DEHM-ee glahs]: A brown sauce that has been
reduced until thick enough to coat a spoon. Look for demi-glace
mixes in grocery stores with the packaged gravies. Also, specialty
stores sell demi-glace concentrates that are simply reconstituted
before using.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hummus [HOOM-uhs]: A thick Middle Eastern sauce made with
ground chickpeas, lemon juice and garlic. Usually served as a dip
with pita toasts, hummus can also be added to sandwiches or placed
in the center of salads to add a different texture. Look for it in
plastic containers in the produce or refrigerated specialty
departments of area grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jicama [HEE-kah-mah]: A large, bulbous root vegetable with
thin brown skin. Its white flesh has chestnut-like texture and
tastes sweetly nutty. Jicama is also particularly good at picking
up the flavors of other ingredients. Use it raw in salads or cook
lightly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Miso [MEE-soh]: Fermented soy bean paste, it's a Japanese
culinary staple. The color of miso ranges from yellow to brown. Use
lighter-colored miso in light soups, darker ones in heavier dishes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nori [NOH-ree]: Paper-thin sheets of dried seaweed. Nori is
used in sushi making but is also used as a garnish or seasoning
when finely cut.
</P>
<P>
   _ Phyllo [FEE-loh]: The same as filo, this word translates from
the Greek for ``leaf.'' It refers to tissue-thin layers of dough
used in pastries and savory Greek dishes. Phyllo dough is available
in the frozen food sections of most markets. Be sure to keep it
covered with a damp towel while using to prevent the thin sheets
from drying.
</P>
<P>
   _ Polenta [poh-LEHN-tah]: A mush made from cornmeal, polenta can
be served hot and soft like porridge (in the South it is called
grits) or cooled and cut into pieces. Polenta is now available
precooked and cooled in rolls in the produce departments of area
grocery stores. Fry it and serve with mozzarella and tomatoes, or
use it as the base for casseroles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seitan [SAY-tan]: Also known as ``wheat meat,'' seitan is a
protein-rich food made from wheat gluten. It has a chewy texture
and a neutral flavor. For best texture and flavor, add seitan to
dishes at the last minute and heat only until warmed through. Look
for it in health food stores and Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   _ TVP (texture vegetable protein): A meat substitute used in
vegetarian cooking. It's available in crumbled form or you can buy
frozen vegetarian burgers and crumble them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tahini [tah-HEE-nee]: A thick paste made from ground sesame
seeds. Often used in Middle Eastern cooking, it can flavor hummus.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tamari [tuh-MAH-ree]: A dark sauce made from soybeans, tamari
is similar to soy sauce but thicker. Find it in the Asian section
of grocery stores and in Asian markets. It is usually used as a
condiment or dipping sauce.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tamarind [TAM-uh-rihnd]: The fruit of a tall shade tree grown
in Asia and India, tamarind pods are about 5 inches long and
contain a sweet-sour pulp that is a favorite flavor in East Indian
and Middle Eastern cuisines. It's also used to flavor soft drinks
and is an important ingredient in Worcestershire sauce. Whole
tamarind pods can sometimes be found prepackaged in
</P>
<P>
   the produce sections of larger supermarkets.

<P>
   COOKING TERMS
</P>
<P>
   _ Confit [kohn-FEE]: An old method for preserving meat, confit
is meat that has been salted and then slowly cooked in its own fat
until it falls off the bone. The cooked meat is then packed into a
crock and covered in fat for storage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coulis [koo-LEE]: In modern culinary terms, a thick puree or
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   _ Medallions [meh-DAL-yuhns]: A small, coin-shaped piece of
meat, usually beef, veal or pork. (When ordering in a restaurant,
emphasis is on the word small).
</P>
<P>
   _ Roux [ROO]: A mixture of flour and fat which, after being
cooked over low heat, is used to thicken soups and stews. There are
three types: white, blond and brown, depending how long the mixture
is cooked. To make a roux, melt butter or pork fat in a saucepan.
Add an equal amount of flour and cook, stirring, until blended and
as browned as needed for the dish you are
</P>
<P>
   preparing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Slurry: A thin paste of water and flour of cornstarch that is
stirred into soups, stir-fries and gravies for use as a thickener.
After a slurry is added, cook for a few minutes to ensure that the
flavor of the raw flour or cornstarch does not remain.

USING KNOWLEDGE BASE CAN HELP YOU FIX A NUMBER OF WINDOWS PROGRAMS 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I just upgraded to Windows 98 Second Edition. Now, when my
computer starts up, I get a message that says ``The Shell32.dll
file is Linked to Missing Export Shlwapi.dll: ShRegGetUAValueA.'' I
can click past it and everything's fine. But what does this mean,
and how can I stop it from coming up?
</P>
<P>
   A: While this is a fairly arcane error message, its cause and
fix are both helpful to know because they illustrate bigger issues.
</P>
<P>
   When you have an error message like this, one helpful strategy
for fixing it is to use the Microsoft Knowledge Base, the database
of information used by Microsoft's own tech support staff, and
available to users online at
support.microsoft.com/support/search/c.asp.
</P>
<P>
   To try to figure out this problem, I went to the Knowledge Base
and entered the names of the two files mentioned _ shell32.dll and
shlwapi.dll. One of the articles that came up in the search had the
very error message you included in your question.
</P>
<P>
   The article at
support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q226/5/46.ASP indicated
that some people who have Visioneer's PaperPort software on their
computers may experience a similar problem if they have a copy of
shlwapi.dll in the PaperPort folder that's older than the version
in the windowssystem folder.
</P>
<P>
   If so, once you copy the newer version from the windowssystem
folder into the PaperPort folder, the problem should go away.
(First, rename the older one, rather than allowing it to be
overwritten or deleted, in case doing so creates worse problems.)
</P>
<P>
   What's the tech-support moral here? There are two.
</P>
<P>
   First, you can fix many bizarre Windows programs by using the
Knowledge Base in this manner. If you have just one file mentioned
in an error message, it's harder. But two or more files will narrow
down the search.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it's not uncommon for problems to arise when you have
two different versions of a file on your computer. For example,
there's a file that's part of the system used to connect to the
Internet called winsock.dll that's notorious for causing problems
if a non-matching duplicate exists elsewhere on the system.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a new Windows 98 computer and I want to donate my
older computer to a charity or a school, but I want to make sure
all my personal data is removed first. I understand the best way to
do this is to format your hard drive. Sorry, I don't know how to do
this. Can you explain in layman's terms how to do this?
</P>
<P>
   A: You'll first need to make sure you have a Windows boot disk.
When you went through the setup process on your new computer, you
should have been asked to create an emergency boot disk, and
hopefully you did this. If you did not, you'll have to make one.
</P>
<P>
   You can find out how to make one by going to the Windows Help
file and doing a search on ``boot disk.'' The instructions are
there.
</P>
<P>
   Boot your computer from this disk. Simply put it in the floppy
drive and restart the machine. When it boots up, you'll see an A:
prompt and a flashing cursor. At this prompt, type: format c:
</P>
<P>
   You'll get several warnings _ type the appropriate responses to
get past them. When you are done, you'll have a hard disk with no
operating system. Whoever buys it won't be able to use it until
they install an operating system on it.
</P>
<P>
   Be aware that someone using the right kind of software could,
possibly, recover your files. It's unlikely that any charity
receiving an older machine would go to this trouble. If you're
still concerned, you might want to use a program designed to
completely obliterate sensitive files. One such program is called
Shredder95, and you can get a demo copy at
www.gale-force.com/shredder95/indexa.html

<TEXT>
<P>
   10TH OF RAMADAN CITY, Egypt _ In life, co-pilot Gameel
El-Batouty appeared to be the model of Egyptian gentility. In
death, he is suspected of a cardinal Egyptian sin _ suicide.
</P>
<P>
   When visiting the villa retreat where he planned to spend his
retirement, Batouty would not stay in his enclosed garden, but
rather sit on his small driveway to chat with neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Batouty was a father of five and the burly son of a landed Nile
Delta family. His down-to-earth values transcended Egypt's class
hierarchy. He smoked the water pipe with his servants and brought a
butcher to slaughter lambs for curbside feasts.
</P>
<P>
   He joined neighbors in the mosques on Fridays and, like many of
farmer stock, did not believe in insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But Western officials, in so-far unsupported leaks to the press,
say Batouty may have intentionally plunged EgyptAir Flight 990 into
the Atlantic Ocean, killing himself and 216 passengers and crew.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane crashed Oct. 31, less than an hour after it left
John F. Kennedy Airport in New York for Cairo. A flight voice
recorder, officials say, appears to capture Batouty in the cockpit
and muttering a prayer before the plane's fatal dive.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall
criticized the leaks and the ``misinformation'' that has been
spread. He said a team of U.S. and Egyptian analysts were trying to
compose a translation and transcript.
</P>
<P>
   The murder of hundreds of people would be one of the most
heinous crimes in Egypt's modern history. But, as much as that, it
is the thought of a suicide that makes most Egyptians reject the
reports from U.S. investigators.
</P>
<P>
   A suicide by a man of Batouty's status in this status-driven
country would simply defy the national logic.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide is a bigger taboo here than in the United States,
something a man with any regard for his family or religion would
just not do.
</P>
<P>
   First, it is a sin in Islam. Muslims commonly believe that
people who commit suicide go to Hell.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for an example of a famous Egyptian suicide, one college
professor had to recall back to Cleopatra, noting that it was
before Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe even more important than religion, though, is the high
value placed on collective family reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suicide and other socially unacceptable behavior would shame
the family. It would not bring sympathy,'' Egyptian psycho-analyst
Ahmed Fayek said.
</P>
<P>
   A suicide brings scorn to the family, Fayek said. The daughters
of a man who commits suicide would have trouble finding husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Fayek distinguished between suicides over personal problems, as
investigators speculate about Batouty, and suicide attacks from
fundamentalists, who believe their action is part of a holy war.
</P>
<P>
   Both, though, are widely criticized in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of suicide in the United States and Canada is
common,'' said Fayek, who practiced in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``(In Egypt), society does not permit you to commit suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, in the days since investigators singled out Batouty,
Egyptians have closed ranks as a family of 60 million. They reject
any suggestion that Batouty could have could have committed an act
that would so defy the cultural logic.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow pilots have held a press conference to defend Batouty.
Street corners are alive with conspiracy theories and cover-ups.
Those being interviewed by foreign press are urged to denounce the
suicide speculation.
</P>
<P>
   The stigma of suicide means that if Batouty had planned it he
would not have let it be known. If family or friends know about it,
they would likely not come forward, for fear of compounding
family's misery or endangering national prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Fayek is one of a minority who will not rule out that Batouty
may have taken the Boeing 767 into its crash. Without evidence of
terrorism or mechanical failure, he said, it must be considered
possible that Batouty had a ``severe psychotic breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said that investigators will have to come up with more
than a few sketchy words on a flight recorder to contradict the
cultural forces against suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Family and acquaintances provide other reasons to doubt that
Batouty committed a mass murder-suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from Batouty's three-bedroom villa, about an
hour from his Cairo apartment, neighbors say he had plans.
</P>
<P>
   Retired banker Mahmoud Khairy, 63, said he visited with Batouty
a month ago. At the time, he said, Batouty planned to soon take his
10-year-old daughter, Aya, to Los Angeles to treat her Lupus. They
said her condition was improving and the treatment was just to
assure her progress.
</P>
<P>
   That matched family statements. While some have speculated that
Aya's uninsured treatments were breaking Batouty financially. It
seems illogical he would kill himself just before his daughter's
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very special to him. She was his youngest child,''
Khairy said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Khairy, who knew Batouty 10 years, said the seasoned pilot gave
no indication of financial problems _ one possible motive for a
suicide. Not only was Batouty the son of a wealthy landowner, his
wife is from a wealthy family. His children included two
accountants and a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Others questioned speculation that Batouty was frustrated
because, at 59 years of age and just months away from mandatory
retirement, he was still just a co-pilot rather than a full
captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, he was not frustrated,'' said Roushdie Zakaria,
EgyptAir's deputy chief for the 767 crews.
</P>
<P>
   Peers said Batouty returned to civil aviation from the Egyptian
Air Force too late in life _ in his mid-40s _ to expect to be
captain.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with family members, there have been gaps. For
example, while one cousin said Batouty had lined up post-retirement
job with another airline, he would not say which airline.
</P>
<P>
   But, clouding the case is the unofficial nature of the reports
about the recording; reports first said there was no problem in the
cockpit and later gave two different versions of Batouty's words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fueling the conspiracy theories,'' said American
University of Cairo political sociologist Saad Eddin Ibrahim. In
one of Ibrahim's recent classes, only one of 45 students said they
considered suicide a possibility in the airplane crash.

SMALL DEVICES WON'T REPLACE PCS SOON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Twenty years ago, the Computer Dealers Exposition
hosted a mere 4,000 visitors who came to this ultra-tacky city in
the desert to make deals with each other. The IBM personal computer
was two years away.
</P>
<P>
   The PC not only changed Comdex, as the event became known, but
it also changed modern society. Personal computers are now on
nearly every white-collar desktop in America and in more than 50
percent of all homes. Connecting these machines is the Internet,
which is creating further astounding change in our day-to-day
lives.
</P>
<P>
   So, it's particularly interesting at the 20th anniversary of
Comdex that so many people here are ready to say the PC's time has
passed. The buzz among the 200,000-plus who have gathered this week
is that we are either moving into the post-PC era or the PC-plus
era.
</P>
<P>
   The former argument says the PC has outlived its usefulness, and
that a new generation of smaller, cheaper, easier-to-use
information appliances will take its place. The latter decrees that
these devices will indeed flourish and become more popular but will
serve to supplement the PC, which will remain the central
information manager in homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The official theme of this year's Comdex is ``Beyond the PC,''
with a heavy emphasis on these small, single-focus devices.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts and pundits have been falling all over themselves
to tout the coming of information appliances for several years,
I've been dubious. And after spending a few days wandering the
crowded booths on what is supposed to be the dawn of the
info-appliance age, I've not seen much to change my mind.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WRESTLING WITH DEVICES' LIMITATIONS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say there won't be _ or that there aren't already
_ useful information appliances. But it doesn't make sense that
these devices will overwhelm, supplant and become more popular than
the PC. The very thing that is supposed to be attractive about them
leads to their biggest downfall _ they have built-in limitations.
And when it comes to information, users hate limits.
</P>
<P>
   One of the products shown here this week is something called a
``Web companion,'' a type of small terminal used primarily to surf
the Web and send and receive e-mail. Houston's own Compaq Computer
Corp. was showing one of these at an event called Showstopper, and
branded the brief exhibition as a ``technology demonstration.''
</P>
<P>
   It uses a small passive-matrix, flat-panel display propped up on
a base, with a nifty wireless keyboard. The keyboard has buttons _
similar in design to the Internet keyboard found on Compaq's
Presario desktops _ that can do specific tasks, such as launching
Web pages or an e-mail program.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect to find this device, which is still in search of a
name, on store shelves anytime soon. Once it's ready, Compaq plans
to sell it to companies who either offer Net access or services
over the Web, such as an online merchant, a bank or a stock trading
firm.
</P>
<P>
   The business would then resell the devices to its customers, or
even give them away. The business could then control what customers
see on the screen, essentially creating a window to the Web viewed
only through that business' brand.
</P>
<P>
   This is a smart move. By having other companies subsidize the
cost of the device when they make it available to their customers,
they get around a big problem with these information appliances _
the cost.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PRICES COMPETE WITH DESKTOPS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the single-purpose devices I've seen here are going to
be selling in the $200 to $500 price range. The ones that are
capable of Web surfing are usually at the higher end of the
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   But at that point, they start competing in price with the
low-cost PCs that are out there. Why buy a device that will limit
your capabilities for $500 when you can get a device with no limits
for the same price or a little more?
</P>
<P>
   Information appliance boosters claim the PC isn't easy or
reliable enough for those who are not technically savvy. But given
the exploding consumer market for PCs _ and the fact that nearly
everyone who buys one gets onto the Net _ this seems to be a
specious argument. Certainly, people are figuring out PCs and
making them work.
</P>
<P>
   The whole concept of the information appliance is, I think,
flawed. Their proponents use the toaster analogy, saying you don't
need a commercial kitchen just to make toast.
</P>
<P>
   But information isn't like toast. Most people, when they are
getting information, like to do something with it. They want to
change it, share it, create it. These devices, by and large, do not
allow that. You can look at the information, maybe print it out,
maybe forward it via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   (To Compaq's credit, its device has several Universal Serial Bus
ports and an Ethernet network connection. That means you will be
able to connect printers, scanners and external drives to it _ but
only if Compaq provides the support for them. You'll also be able
to hook it up to a home network, and receive from and send
information to _ you guessed _ a real PC.)
</P>
<P>
   I frequently get mail from frustrated users of Microsoft's WebTV
device who buy the television-based Web terminal for its
simplicity. But suddenly they discover that they can't see some of
the fancier features on Web pages, can't chat online with their
friends and can't do any of the myriad of things that their
PC-owning friends can do.
</P>
<P>
   I guess if you insisted on carrying the toast analogy forward,
you could say that very few people eat their toast plain. They like
a little jelly on it.
</P>
<P>
   These information appliances don't have jelly. They're a bit
dry. And that's why I think the reports of the death of the PC are
greatly exaggerated.

SURVEYS SHOW THAT GALLUP UNDER FIRE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You have to wonder if the Gallup Organization took the advice of
``First, Break All the Rules,'' a management book written by two of
its executives, a bit too literally.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, the National Labor Relations Board found that
Gallup illegally prevented its employees from trying to organize a
union and is defending its actions before an administrative law
judge.
</P>
<P>
   Gallup, which is famous for surveying employees, apparently
wasn't paying attention to its own.
</P>
<P>
   Employees, who said they were tired of not being treated fairly,
called in the United Steelworkers of America. The campaign began in
April with employees meeting secretly.
</P>
<P>
   Once the company learned of the organizing attempts, it issued
rules against posting union literature on bulletin boards, and
Chief Executive Jim Clifton threatened employees with job loss if
they supported the union, according to the board, which took up the
employees' cause after employees filed complaints with the federal
agency.
</P>
<P>
   In September, a board investigation found that the pollster
fired four employees in its Houston office for their union
organizing. Moreover, the board has found that the polling
organization prohibited employees from distributing union
literature, denied them access to the company's copying machine
after the union campaign began and prohibited employees from
talking up the union to their co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
COMPANY GIVES OWN REASONS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman could not be reached for comment but in the
courtroom testimony, the Lincoln, Neb.-based company said that two
employees were fired for falsifying time records while a third was
fired for sexual harassment. According to the company, a fourth was
fired for using profanity to a survey respondent.
</P>
<P>
   The company also contends it had pre-existing rules prohibiting
the distribution of notices to new employees and the use of copying
equipment for non-business reasons, according to its response to
the NLRB complaint. The company also contends it never refused a
request to post union literature.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth E. Small, resident officer for the board in Houston, said
the NLRB believed Gallup's actions were egregious enough that it
has authorized her to seek a temporary injuction that would force
the organization to permit employees to mount a union campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It may not seem like such a big deal, said Small, but literature
is a way for employees to communicate about a union. And firing
employees a company believes are involved in a unionization attempt
discourages other employees from joining a union.
</P>
<P>
   It's an odd juxtaposition for a company that prides itself on
its communication skills to have such a hard time listening to its
own employees.
</P>
<P>
   Unionizing campaigns don't typically happen at companies where
employees are happy. They typically begin in places where employees
feel they're not treated with dignity. Wages and benefit issues are
typically secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best union organizers are poor management,'' said Richard
Shaw, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO and a longtime union
organizer. ``We couldn't organize without bad managers.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EX-EMPLOYEES CITE FAVORITISM &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ex-Gallup employees who led the union drive said they were
fed up with what they believed was favoritism that pitted employees
against one another.
</P>
<P>
   Lucrative survey jobs were given to favorite employees, said one
ex-employee, while jobs that didn't pay as well went to those who
weren't as favored.
</P>
<P>
   And there weren't standard operating procedures, making it hard
to figure out which rules to follow, said another ex-employee, who
asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept hearing: `If you don't like it, find someplace else to
work,''' the employee said.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be something that the authors of ``First, Break All
the Rules'' would suggest. Gallup executives Curt Coffman and
Marcus Buckingham surveyed more than 80,000 managers in more than
400 companies.
</P>
<P>
   The workplace experts sought to find out what makes a good
manager and found it comes down to giving people an opportunity to
do their best work, treat employees as if they're important and
find the right fit.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the authors wrote in their introduction: ``The talented
employee may join a company because of its charismatic leaders, its
generous benefits and its world-class training programs, but how
long that employee stays and how productive he is while he is there
is determined by his relationship with his immediate supervisor.''

SQUIGGLY LINES INTERFERE WITH HUSBAND, WIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Something is interfering with my marriage, and
I need help. We get five television channels at our house _ two
PBS, NBC, CBS and ABC. Most of the programs my husband wants to
watch are on NBC and CBS. I'd rather work on my computer than watch
any of them, but my computer causes interference on (only) those
two channels. What am I to do short of getting a husband who'd
rather watch PBS and ABC?
</P>
<P>
   _ Fine Tuning
</P>
<P>
   DEAR FINE: Well, you could wait for ABC to develop quality
programming aimed at mature adults, but your computer will be
obsolete by then. And PBS? I doubt if another nine-part Ken Burns
series on dollmaking in the Pennsylvania Dutch country will hold
your husband's attention long enough for you to finish Quake III.
</P>
<P>
   I know you never read the manual that came with your computer,
but somewhere inside it is a statement informing you that your
magic box generates radio frequency energy that can interfere with
radio or TV reception. In the United States, that interference has
to fall within certain limits or the computer can't be put on the
market. Even though your PC probably qualifies, that's no guarantee
you won't see squiggly lines on some channels.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing the Federal Communications Commission, one of our
least noxious agencies, has an in-depth guide to interference on
its Web site. Read through
www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Compliance/WWW/tvibook.html to learn everything
you could possibly want to know about why there are lines all over
Don Johnson's face. Other than the wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting to the chase, you're going to need a filter. You can buy
a toroid choke, which sounds like what you'd like to do to Aaron
Spelling's daughter every time you see her ``act,'' but is actually
something you clamp on a computer cable to keep it from spewing
squigglies. Try Radio Shack part No. 273-105.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, you'll have to escalate with a tunable
notch filter, which can selectively block interference. Find a TV
repair shop where they actually do the work instead of sending sets
back to the manufacturer, and they can probably help you. Or search
for ``notch filter'' on the Web for plenty of sources.
</P>
<P>
   What really intrigues me is that you have only five channels. If
you think ABC, CBS and NBC are bad, you should see UPN, WB and Fox.
You wouldn't be complaining about interference if you could see the
dreck they churn out.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I've heard that Windows 2000 will continue to
use a DOS base, as has Windows 98. True?
</P>
<P>
   _ Same Old Same Old
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SAME: In the continuing game of three-card monty known as
Microsoft product development, Windows 2000 is no longer Windows
2000. At least not the Windows 2000 you're thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   The original plan was to merge Windows NT, the true 32-bit
network operating system used in commercial settings, with the
plain old garden-variety Windows you're used to. Didn't work. Too
much code to write. Windows 2000 would probably have been ready
around 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Win2K, due for release in February, will be a tarted-up
version of NT. Windows Millennium _ no scheduled release _ will be
a tarted-up version of Windows 98. And yes, DOS is still buried
deep in there.
</P>
<P>
   (Dr. Emilio Bombay has already tried Windows 2000. He says it
should be called ``Windows 2000 Flushes,'' but he was feeling
really cranky that day. Microsoft lovers may complain to

ATLANTA'S LOSS OF HIGH MUSEUM CHIEF WILL BE HOUSTON'S ART GAIN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Moved in ``a'' and ``e'' categories) 
 
By CHARLES WARD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Ned Rifkin, the highly regarded director of the High
Museum of Art in Atlanta, has been named director of the Menil
Collection. He will take over Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkin's appointment ends a period of turbulence at the Houston
museum. It began with the death of founder and benefactor Dominique
de Menil in December 1997 and peaked in February, when Paul Winkler
resigned as director and board member. Winkler left in protest of
the Menil Foundation board's dismissal of Miles Glaser, longtime
confidant and financial adviser to Dominique de Menil, who with her
husband, John, amassed the 15,000 objects that constitute the
museum's holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkin said moving to Houston would allow him to return to his
principal interests, ``reading, scholarship and curating,'' and to
explore the work of living artists in depth.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, he will avoid committing himself to a long
period of fund-raising, design and construction at the High Museum,
which is in the early stages of planning a major new building.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkin, 50, has headed the Atlanta museum since 1991. During his
tenure, the number of museum members tripled to 40,000, and the
endowment grew from $15 million to $56 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The High Museum has never been in a more favorable position,''
Rifkin said. ``Its future is very bright, and the numbers show
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the rising stars in the field,'' said Peter
Marzio, director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. ``He's not a
shaker-upper. He will quietly go about the business of making the
Menil more active. He's passionate about art, a straight shooter,
and he's a gentle person.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he's coming to a smaller museum says a lot about
the Menil and about Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   The High is a large, general museum known for exhibitions of
work by well-known artists (the latest being Norman Rockwell) and
for folk art. The Menil, by contrast, is a small, private
institution whose strong international reputation derives from its
collections of antiquities, medieval and Byzantine art, tribal art
from Africa, Oceania and the Pacific Northwest, and 20th-century
art, especially surrealism. The High receives about 650,000
visitors per year; the Menil, roughly 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   After earning a Ph.D. in art from the University of Michigan,
Rifkin was an assistant professor at the University at
Texas-Arlington from 1977 to 1980. He taught courses in 19th- and
20th-century art, as well as the history of cinema, photography and
contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   While in Arlington, he frequently traveled to Houston as Texas
editor for Art Week, a magazine based in the San Francisco area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I visited the (Menils') home and met Mrs. de Menil, although I
doubt she would have remembered me. I knew her collection (as it
existed) in her home, marvelled at it even then and understood the
uniqueness of it,'' Rifkin said.
</P>
<P>
   He started his career in arts administration in 1981 as curator
and then assistant director of the new Museum of Contemporary Art
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Later Rifkin served as curator at the Hirshhorn Museum and
Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., which houses a vast
collection of 20th-century sculpture, and curator of contemporary
art at that city's Corcoran Gallery of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkin said that his first task in Houston would be to get a
sense of how the Menil Collection functions in the city and in the
lives of the people who visit it. Then, he said, he would begin to
address his mission _ ``to enhance and augment the legacy of the
Menil family'' and the ``clear need for more people to understand
and utilize the collection, both locally and internationally.''

SCHOOL-PRAYER MOVE IS BUILDING ITS HOUSE ON A BAD FOUNDATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For someone who attended public schools in states beyond the
Bible Belt, the flap over prayer in school is baffling at best, and
a total misdirection of focus and energy by otherwise well-meaning
Christians at worst.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court's decision this week to take up the issue
of student-initiated prayer at high school football games will
bring plenty of attention to the high court _ particularly in
Texas, where prayer and football go together like octogenarians and
Keogh funds.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect the court to issue a sweeping decision that
will, once and for all, settle the debate. This court is not known
for bright-line proclamations, and it's likely that the decision
will only address the process by which the Santa Fe school district
drew up its policy rather than the invocations themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It's abundantly clear from the various policy versions that
school administrators wrestled with before settling on the final
rule that they specifically had religious speech in mind. And that,
my friends, violates the Establishment Clause of the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate over prayer in public schools, proponents oft
times throw out the blanket statement that this nation was founded
on strong Judeo-Christian beliefs. But that holds true only if one
interprets the Founding Fathers' system of morality as being the
exclusive domain of Christianity, which it most definitely was not.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, many of the Founding Fathers were not evangelical
believers. Quite the contrary, they expressed aversions toward
supernatural religion. Christian author and scholar Michael Horton
outlined in detail the attitudes of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas
Paine, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams in his book ``Beyond
Cultural Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson berated the doctrine of the Trinity as superstition
and went so far as to write his own Bible, devoid of the moral
teachings of Jesus, discounting the deity of Christ and completely
excluding the Resurrection and salvation. Adams mirrored
Jefferson's disdain for Christ's deity, writing that if by religion
people meant doctrines, specifically orthodox Christian ones, then
the world would be a better place with no religion at all.
</P>
<P>
   Horton quotes the writing of Paine, who penned that the ``lies
of the Bible have been the cause'' of all wars, with religion's
``monstrous belief that God has spoken to man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Founding Fathers were interested in building a free, just
and civil state. Their interest lay as much in keeping religion in
check as in guaranteeing citizens the right to worship as they
pleased.
</P>
<P>
   In Benson Bobrick's narrative of the American Revolution,
``Angel in the Whirlwind,'' he recounts Jefferson's draft of
Virginia's Statute for Religious Freedom. In it, Jefferson wrote:
``Almighty God hath created the mind free. Our civil rights have no
dependence on our religious opinions, any more than our opinions of
physics or geometry. ... The opinions of men are not the object of
civil government, nor under its jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The intractable position of some Christian activists who don't
see that laws are written to protect the minority continues to
mystify. Mob rule is not the law of the land. Democratic country
that this is, it's important to remember that it is first and
foremost a republic. That means representative government, not
government by popular referendum.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a majority-rule nation, and Christians should thank
their lucky stars that it isn't, because the possibility exists
that one day the majority might believe in Mohammed, Buddha or some
divine being other than Jesus Christ. Then the gospel's teachings
about Christians being persecuted and ridiculed for their beliefs
might be all too true _ right here in the good ol' U.S. of A.
</P>
<P>
   The crusade to bring ``prayer'' back to public schools _ no
matter how generic and pantheistic it would have to be to have any
hope of passing a constitutional smell test _ is little more than a
populist political exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironically, we rail against religious pluralism while we push
for prayer in the schools, no matter the religion or object of
faith. The `unknown god' will do just fine,'' Horton wrote. ``So,
evangelical Christianity has just become one more voting bloc
asserting its political rights, along with other special interest
groups.''
</P>
<P>
   As author Philip Yancey wrote in a 1993 article for
``Christianity Today,'' ``the coziness between church and
government has led to a loss of respect for the church.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no winners in this political debate over prayer _ not
the schools and not the Christian church. Christians need to turn
to the Gospel to find the truth, not to legislative bodies. If
there is prayer in the home and the heart, it will matter not one
whit that it does not emanate from the PA system at a high school
football game.

A TRADITION TOO POWERFUL TO DIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK Z. SMITH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keep Bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   This is an instance in which tragedy shouldn't destroy
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at Texas A&AMP;M University, the loss of tradition would be
its own tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   There is no school in the Lone Star State with traditions as
rich as those of the Texas Aggies _ traditions that help bond its
43,000 students together and give the school its unique flavor. And
the world's largest bonfire, held annually before the football game
against the archrival University of Texas, is among the most
cherished of those traditions.
</P>
<P>
   If you abolish Bonfire, you steal a piece of the school's
remarkable spirit. And that spirit is a huge part of what defines
A&AMP;M and shapes its character.
</P>
<P>
   The multiple deaths and injuries suffered in the accident on the
A&AMP;M campus early Thursday morning are terribly saddening. This
tragedy should cause A&AMP;M administrators to look hard at what went
wrong and what can be done to make the process of building the
enormous bonfire ``stack'' safer.
</P>
<P>
   But it should be remembered that in 90 years of building the
bonfire, there has been no similar tragedy. In 1994, the stack
collapsed in an incident blamed on wet grounds, but no one was
injured.
</P>
<P>
   I certainly wouldn't take issue with the decision of A&AMP;M
officials to cancel this year's Bonfire. But they should not
permanently abolish it.
</P>
<P>
   A single tragedy should not cause the cancellation of such a
long-standing, revered event. After terrorists murdered 11 members
of the Israeli Olympics team at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich,
Germany, future Olympics competition was not canceled. Nor should
it have been.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, I asked a fellow journalist at the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram, an ardent Aggie, how she felt about continuing
Bonfire. She told me she would find it ``heartbreaking'' to see the
tradition end.
</P>
<P>
   Then she posed a question. What if A&AMP;M's Kyle Field were to
suffer a structural collapse at a football game, resulting in
fatalities and injuries? Should the A&AMP;M administration then declare
that football never again be played at the school? Or that no
stadium ever be built again? She obviously didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Bonfire is such a strong tradition, I'm not sure the school
``could'' ensure its abolition.
</P>
<P>
   The school has canceled Bonfire only once previously _ in 1963,
in the wake of the Kennedy assassination.
</P>
<P>
   But even that year there was a bonfire, though not a
school-sanctioned one, recalls Jim Robinson, a cattle raiser in the
Texas Panhandle who was attending A&AMP;M at the time. I talked to
Robinson, a third-generation Aggie, on the phone Thursday from his
home in Clarendon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, Robinson, his roommate and another fellow member of the
Spider D company of the Corps of Cadets went down to a spot on the
Brazos River the night before that year's game against Texas and
began cutting wood. Pretty soon, virtually the entire Spider D
outfit was there, Robinson recalls. Aided by a bright moon, ``we
cut wood all night,'' Robinson said. They soon had a big bonfire
going, though it eventually would be doused by rain.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he feels about preserving Bonfire in the wake of
Thursday's accident, Robinson's answer was terse: ``Keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   He fondly recalled all the ``time and sweat and tears'' that
went into cutting wood for Bonfire, a process that occurs over
roughly two months and entails the chopping of thousands of logs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just bonded doing things like that,'' Robinson said. ``It
gives you a sense of pride when you build something like that ...
the whole Corps would turn out when I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   I was first exposed to the school's great traditions as a
teen-ager when I attended an Aggie Muster in my hometown. During
muster, there is a roll call of deceased Aggies. When each name is
called, someone answers, ``Here'' to symbolize the fact that the
deceased Aggie is there in spirit. Tears flow profusely when Silver
Taps is played by buglers at muster. It's a tremendously moving
experience.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't go to college at A&AMP;M, but I have become further
acquainted with its traditions as a result of having two daughters
now going there.
</P>
<P>
   I was among the thousands of worried parents calling College
Station early Thursday morning to make sure my offspring were
unharmed. Thankfully, they were, although Amanda, a senior, was in
tears over the tragedy when I talked to her. Amber, a sophomore,
seemed equally down when my wife, Nina, talked to her.
</P>
<P>
   My heart goes out to the parents of those students who died or
were injured. But I find some solace in knowing that Aggies around
the world will bond even closer as a result of this tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   I have little doubt that the Aggies will be holding future
Bonfires far into the next millennium. Some traditions are just too
powerful to die.

FRONTLINE EXPLORES LINK BETWEEN HISTORY, `REVELATION'

APOCALYPSE 
Written, directed and produced by: William Cran and Ben Loeterman 
On: PBS 
Date: Monday, 9 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The concept of an ``evil empire'' precedes Ronald Reagan's
speech writers by nearly two millennia, resonating through the Book
of Revelation. The New Testament book demonized the Roman Empire
for destroying the great Second Temple in Jerusalem. Over the
centuries, that concept, and Revelation's fiery images of a final
battle between good and evil, have been inventively reinterpreted,
and creatively and sometimes dangerously distorted, by countless
apocalyptic religious sects and secular movements.
</P>
<P>
   Thus we learn in ``Apocalypse,'' a two-hour edition of the PBS
Frontline series, that groups as diverse as the Nazis and the
Branch Davidians, as well as the Puritans and later American
revolutionists all drew inspiration and rhetoric from Revelation.
Some interpreters of the controversial Biblical book, itself deeply
influenced by early Jewish responses to serial invasions and
captivities, continue today to predict a literal Armageddon, and
soon. Millennial change has historically fueled apocalyptic terror
and hope.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine a documentary subject any richer than this
or, in the case of ``Apocalypse,'' a duller or more conventional
treatment of it. It's also hard to think that many viewers will
have their eyes open by the time its livelier anecdotes unfold,
beginning with the intriguing story of Thomas Muntzer, a disciple
of Martin Luther's. Muntzer siezed on the messages and images of
Revelation to support a class revolution, and led thousands of
peasants to their deaths in a futile pitched battle. East German
communists would later erect an impressive monument to him,
boasting the largest canvas in the world, depicting his visions of
Judgment and justice.
</P>
<P>
   But far more often than not, ``Apocalypse'' is the stiffest of
lessons, striving overambitiously to mash more than 2000 years of
history into two hours of television.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it plays like a painful caricature of dryly standard
documentary procedure. An invisible, monotonous narrator intones
names, dates and factoids until your brain locks. To his script are
added the words of a medley of scholarly talking heads, many of
whom would surely be interesting elsewhere, but not in this
stultefying context. And finally, there is the visual content,
which features countless closeups of flickering candles, words
printed in fine old typefaces, and the turning pages of
venerable-looking tomes _ rare bibles, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   The apocalypse has never looked, or sounded, so soporific.

CONGRESS APPROVES CRACKDOWN ON SWEEPSTAKES FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate approved legislation Friday designed to
crackdown on sweepstakes companies that aim to entice people to
purchase magazines and other consumer items in order to boost their
chances of winning large cash prizes.
</P>
<P>
   The measure bans sweepstakes firms like Readers Digest and
Publishers Clearing House from sending out mailings describing a
recipient as a ``winner'' unless they have actually won a prize.
Companies would also have to clearly tell consumers that no
purchase is necessary to win and that making a purchase does not
increase the chances of winning.
</P>
<P>
   The bill won House approval last week and is now headed to
President Clinton for his signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new requirements in this legislation will address the
deceptive techniques that have caused countless Americans, many of
them elderly, to purchase products they do not need or want,'' said
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, one of the bill's authors.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses at Senate hearings earlier this year showed how
vulnerable the elderly are to deceptive sweepstakes mailings. One
witness, Eustace Hall, 65, of Brandon, Fla., told lawmakers on the
Senate Governmental Affairs investigations subcommittee that he had
spent nearly $20,000 in the past seven years buying items like
magazines to improve his chances of winning a particular contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sweepstakes used phrases that made me think I was a winner
and that the prize was guaranteed,'' Hall said. ``I was informed by
Publishers Clearing House that, if I returned my sweeps entries
within 24 or 48 or 72 hours, I would win a specific prize.'' Hall
said he never won anything.
</P>
<P>
   The sad stories from Hall and others prompted Collins, the
panel's chairman, and Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., to draft
legislation aimed at keeping seniors and others from becoming
confused about their real chances of winning.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said one of her constituents ``actually canceled needed
surgery because she didn't want to miss Ed McMahon's visit.''
McMahon never showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said he has heard from hundreds of his constituents who
spent thousands of dollars purchasing products in hopes of winning
so-called ``guaranteed'' prizes that never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who believe if they just purchase that
magazine or that product they will seal the deal and the truck will
pull up,'' Levin said ``Most people throw (the envelope) away...but
frequently seniors get lulled in.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure also:
</P>
<P>
   _Allows consumers to request that their names be removed from a
particular mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   _Forbids companies from using mailings that resemble federal
government documents such as a check from the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   _Requires promoters to use much larger print in describing
details such as the long-shot odds of winning and in telling people
no purchase is necessary to win.
</P>
<P>
   _Expands the power of the U.S. Postal Service to crackdown on
deceptive mailing practices and impose fines up to $1 million per
violation.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, American Family Enterprises, which runs a
sweepstakes promotion featuring Dick Clark and Ed McMahon, filed
for bankruptcy protection aimed at settling dozens of lawsuits
alleging deceptive advertising over its sweepstakes.

`SARAH PLAIN AND TALL: WINTER'S END': INTELLIGENT SENTIMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nicest part of ``Sarah Plain and Tall: Winter's End'' is the
way Sarah (Glenn Close) reacts when she finds a grizzled man, a
total stranger, in her barn. Nobody calls 911 or whatever the
equivalent of that would be on the Kansas prairie in 1918. Nobody
looks for the shotgun, even for protection. The children don't
scream. Instead, after making sure he's not sick, Sarah takes the
man, whose name is John (Jack Palance), into the warm house, feeds
him and offers him a bed for the night. He turns out to be her
husband's long-lost father, but she doesn't know that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sarah Plain and Tall: Winter's End,'' a Hallmark Hall of Fame
presentation on CBS Sunday night, is the third ``Sarah Plain and
Tall'' television movie, written by Patricia MacLachlan and based
on the characters and stories in her children's book of the same
name. Its achievement is that Sarah doesn't look idiotic to 1999
eyes when she trusts and helps and sympathizes (she's a strong
woman and has never been anybody's fool); instead she makes us
believe that this used to be a much nicer country, and not so long
ago.
</P>
<P>
   I think I liked Christopher Walken better in the first movie
when, as Jacob Witting, a struggling farmer, he was still obsessed
over the death of his first wife. This gave Jacob a dark side and
an edge that understandably worried Sarah, his mail-order bride
from Maine. But that was in 1910. Now it's 1918, he's contentedly
in love with Sarah, the children adore her, there's freshly made
coffee on the stove every morning, and the house is painted
lemon-drop yellow. The Wittings also have a telephone, and the
family doctor makes his house calls by automobile.
</P>
<P>
   Into all this old-fashioned happiness comes John, who ran away
from his wife and family when Jacob was a little boy and has been
presumed (or maybe wished) long dead. Jacob is not happy to see him
and makes no bones about it. This makes John feel mighty bad
(``I've brought a lot of pain to this house, and all I wanted was
to know my family''), besides which he's sick, maybe very sick.
There are a few more plot complications, including one character
breaking a leg and another getting lost in a blizzard.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is worth watching just for the pleasure of seeing such
a fine cast of actors at work, but the sentiment does get the best
of them now and then. Sarah makes a pretty speech in a sweet voice
about considering Kansas her home now (she used to miss the ocean a
lot); she and the two younger children sing ``Charming Billy''
together after supper; grizzled old John sings ``All Through the
Night'' to Cassie (Emily Osment), the golden-haired youngest,
during a storm. But at least it's intelligent sentiment, like
Sarah's speculation on whether love is enough ``when the hard times
come'' and her reflection on the conspiracy of life's fragility and
time's relentless passing.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Glenn Jordan, who did the first film. Lexi
Randall and Christopher Bell are back as the two older children.
The girl is working for the doctor (George Hearn) and nervously
awaiting the return of her boyfriend from the war. The son is
growing up strong and responsible but is still willing to play
hide-and-seek with Cassie. Everybody looks authentically
windburned, and even the dog seems to know it's just lucky to be
alive.

   Papers that used the story CANADA-GOVGEN, which moved Oct. 24

The New York Times of Nov. 5, 1999:
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article described the appointment
of Adrienne Clarkson as Canada's governor general, the personal
representative of Queen Elizabeth II. Ms. Clarkson, a
Chinese-Canadian television personality, is the country's first
immigrant governor general.
</P>
<P>
   While citing widespread acclaim, the article also reported that
the appointment had ``attracted some thinly veiled racist
thunderbolts.'' At that point, the article quoted from a letter
deploring the appointment, written to two newspapers by Kenneth
Lieblich, a former leader of the Monarchist League of Canada. But
the letter does not mention race.
</P>
<P>
   In a later letter, to The Times, Lieblich said his objection to
Ms. Clarkson was based on her lack of political experience and had
nothing to do with race. The juxtaposition of Lieblich's first
letter with a reference to racism was not justified by any
evidence.

ATLANTA'S LOSS OF HIGH MUSEUM CHIEF WILL BE HOUSTON'S ART GAIN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Moved in ``a'' and ``e'' categories) 
 
By CHARLES WARD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Ned Rifkin, the highly regarded director of the High
Museum of Art in Atlanta, has been named director of the Menil
Collection. He will take over Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkin's appointment ends a period of turbulence at the Houston
museum. It began with the death of founder and benefactor Dominique
de Menil in December 1997 and peaked in February, when Paul Winkler
resigned as director and board member. Winkler left in protest of
the Menil Foundation board's dismissal of Miles Glaser, longtime
confidant and financial adviser to Dominique de Menil, who with her
husband, John, amassed the 15,000 objects that constitute the
museum's holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkin said moving to Houston would allow him to return to his
principal interests, ``reading, scholarship and curating,'' and to
explore the work of living artists in depth.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, he will avoid committing himself to a long
period of fund-raising, design and construction at the High Museum,
which is in the early stages of planning a major new building.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkin, 50, has headed the Atlanta museum since 1991. During his
tenure, the number of museum members tripled to 40,000, and the
endowment grew from $15 million to $56 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The High Museum has never been in a more favorable position,''
Rifkin said. ``Its future is very bright, and the numbers show
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the rising stars in the field,'' said Peter
Marzio, director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. ``He's not a
shaker-upper. He will quietly go about the business of making the
Menil more active. He's passionate about art, a straight shooter,
and he's a gentle person.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he's coming to a smaller museum says a lot about
the Menil and about Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   The High is a large, general museum known for exhibitions of
work by well-known artists (the latest being Norman Rockwell) and
for folk art. The Menil, by contrast, is a small, private
institution whose strong international reputation derives from its
collections of antiquities, medieval and Byzantine art, tribal art
from Africa, Oceania and the Pacific Northwest, and 20th-century
art, especially surrealism. The High receives about 650,000
visitors per year; the Menil, roughly 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   After earning a Ph.D. in art from the University of Michigan,
Rifkin was an assistant professor at the University at
Texas-Arlington from 1977 to 1980. He taught courses in 19th- and
20th-century art, as well as the history of cinema, photography and
contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   While in Arlington, he frequently traveled to Houston as Texas
editor for Art Week, a magazine based in the San Francisco area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I visited the (Menils') home and met Mrs. de Menil, although I
doubt she would have remembered me. I knew her collection (as it
existed) in her home, marvelled at it even then and understood the
uniqueness of it,'' Rifkin said.
</P>
<P>
   He started his career in arts administration in 1981 as curator
and then assistant director of the new Museum of Contemporary Art
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Later Rifkin served as curator at the Hirshhorn Museum and
Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., which houses a vast
collection of 20th-century sculpture, and curator of contemporary
art at that city's Corcoran Gallery of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkin said that his first task in Houston would be to get a
sense of how the Menil Collection functions in the city and in the
lives of the people who visit it. Then, he said, he would begin to
address his mission _ ``to enhance and augment the legacy of the
Menil family'' and the ``clear need for more people to understand
and utilize the collection, both locally and internationally.''

`SHOOTING THE PAST' IS RIGHT ON TARGET

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
SHOOTING THE PAST 
Starring: Lindsay Duncan, Timothy Spall, Liam Cunningham, Billie
Whitelaw

Time: Part 1 airs Sunday at 9 p.m., Part 2 airs next Sunday at 9

<P>
   If you've ever doubted that photographs can steal a little bit
of soul, you won't after watching an extraordinary ``Masterpiece
Theatre'' movie called ``Shooting the Past.'' The mesmerizing
two-part presentation, which begins Sunday night at 9 on Channel 2,
is both an engaging human drama and a deeply-felt homage to the
soulfulness of photography, particularly those old, warped,
black-and-white images that open a window onto an unsuspecting,
antiquated world. These days, of course, we are all camera-ready,
accustomed to starring in our own home videos and waiting for our
own 15 minutes of fame.
</P>
<P>
   The story is fairly simple. ``Shooting the Past'' is set in a
British mansion that houses an archive of more than 10 million
photos. When cool American developer Christopher Anderson decides
to turn the glorious building into ``the American School of
Business for the 21st Century,'' the archive staff has a week to
find a new home for the collection to keep it from being dispersed.
The head of the archive, a devoted woman named Marilyn Truman,
tries to convince Anderson of the value of the photos, so that he
will help. Meanwhile, Truman's caustic head researcher, the
brilliant Oswald Bates, confounds her efforts by offending the
American with irony, insults, and accusations.
</P>
<P>
   The characters in ``Shooting the Past'' are well-rounded and
quirky enough to make the familiar plot setup feel fresh. Truman,
played by the Petula Clark-looking Lindsay Duncan, is touching as
she embarks on a struggle to be effective, and not merely quaint.
Bates is made into a fascinating and sometimes annoying eccentric
by Timothy Spall. And Irish actor Liam Cunningham prevents his
businessman from becoming too much of a greedy American stereotype
by adding a dollop of Gary Cooper-esque charm.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, the magic of ``Shooting the Past'' comes
from the archive photos themselves. They just about steal the movie
from the actors. There are two dazzling sequences _ one in each
part _ in which Truman reaches out to Anderson by showing him a set
of stills and narrating the story behind them. The first is about a
little Jewish girl who gets swept up in the Holocaust, the second
follows one of Anderson's relatives. When Truman finishes her
presentations, Anderson is clearly shaken, overwhelmed by the rich
photographs whose existence hangs in the balance. ``Shooting the
Past'' makes it easy to sympathize with him.

   EUROPE-TALKS (Istanbul, Turkey) _ On the final day of a summit
on European security, President Clinton on Friday joined Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and the leaders of 28 other nations in
signing an agreement limiting conventional weapons in Europe. But
with Chechnya dominating the summit agenda, Clinton said he would
not submit the updated treaty to the Senate until Russia complies
with the new ceilings by reducing its weaponry in and around
Chechnya. By Mark Lacey.

<P>
   ISRAEL-SHAS (Jerusalem) _ Since the present government took
office in July, the Shas party has rocked the boat with pledges to
abandon the coalition and bring it down. In recent weeks, Eli
Yishai, the head of the party, has been flexing his muscles, making
it clear that his party's support for Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
peace efforts is directly linked to Barak's financial support for
his party's debt-ridden schools. By Deborah Sontag.

<P>
   INDONESIA-ACEH (Banda Aceh, Indonesia) _ It has become a
familiar drama in Indonesia: families fleeing a place that has
become dangerous, as old grievances give rise to new and explosive
separatist passions. The last time it was East Timor, which voted
for independence from Indonesia in a referendum in August and was
plunged into bloodshed that subsided only after an Australian-led
international military force landed on its beaches. Now it is Aceh,
a lush, devoutly Islamic province which lies on the extreme western
edge of the Indonesian archipelago and would like nothing more than
to break off from it. Two weeks ago, 500,000 people _ more than a
tenth of Aceh's population _ rallied in front of the triple-domed
mosque in this provincial capital to demand a referendum on whether
they should be granted independence. By Mark Lander.

final budget bill of the year on Friday night. The Senate majority

after a long filibuster by midwestern senators over dairy
legislation evaporated. Senior Republicans, by offering to help the

   BONFIRE-TRADITION (College Station, Texas)_ For the faithful of
Texas A&AMP;M University, the bonfire is a 90-year tradition that binds
generations of students to one another and to the university.
Students aspire to become Red Pots or Brown Pots, the upperclassmen
who oversee the round-the-clock construction effort. Graduates
often return to relive their college days and help out. But in the

is taking place. By Jim Yardley.

BRIDGE CULTURE ON DISPLAY AS TOURNAMENT GETS UNDER WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NATHAN COBB  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ To an outsider who walks into their midst, they seem to
be speaking in tongues and scribbling in code. No wonder that Paul
Soloway, the Henry Aaron of their game, the man who has acquired
more Life Master points than anyone who has ever pulled up a chair
to a bridge table, sounded a tad resigned on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main trouble with bridge,'' declared the 58-year-old
resident of Mill Creek, Wash., ``is that there's no spectator
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, tournament bridge is so obscure that, for the next nine
days, you can wander into Boston's Marriott Copley Place and Westin
Copley Place hotels and perhaps &UR;  &LR; even shake hands with many of the
world's best players while they're playing. But although they may
be performing only for an occasional gaggle of kibitzers, most of
the 6,000 or so competitors from 30 countries who've descended upon
the city for the 1999 Fall North American Bridge Championships do
not take their tricks and trumps lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the competition of this game,'' said Kathie Wei-Sender,
who was born in Beijing, now lives in Nashville, and, at age 69, is
something of a mother figure within the tournament bridge
subculture. ``We do not play for money. We play for honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridge may not be an Olympic sport _ although the World Bridge
Federation was this year recognized by the executive board of
International Olympic Committee, the first step down that long
slope _ but it is not completely inconspicuous. This week's
tournament is one of three such national events staged annually by
the Memphis-based American Contract Bridge League, which claims
170,000 members and 4,000 affiliated clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Participants play with individual partners or as part of
four-person teams, and can enter a plethora of events that will
keep them in cards from breakfast time until past midnight. There
are KO teams, Board-a-Match teams, B-A-M teams, and Swiss teams.
There are open pairs, side pairs, senior pairs, stratified pairs,
newcomer pairs, and master pairs. There are wide-eyed novices and
steel-eyed champions.
</P>
<P>
   There's also no prize money. But notwithstanding the quest for
honor, some players do make a living off bridge. They teach, write
books, and turn up as staffers on cruise ships. They also hire
themselves out to discreet, well-heeled individuals who assemble
teams _ which include themselves _ for tournaments such as this
one. ``It's kind of like someone owning a football team and playing
a position on that team,'' explained Eric Rodwell, a world-class
professional out of West Lafayette, Ind. Dollar amounts are never
discussed publicly, but Soloway said on Thursday night that the
best players among the world's 100 or so bridge full-timers earn
six-figure incomes.
</P>
<P>
   What they don't get is recognition beyond the bridge subculture.
Send Rodwell walking through Copley Place during any other week and
no one would notice him. This week, however, people stop him to
glad-hand and shmooze. After all, he's arguably one of the top half
dozen players in the world, a 42-year-old pro who took up the game
at 11 and hasn't had another occupation _ unless you count the one
in the pizza joint _ since earning his master's degree in business
two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it this way,'' Rodwell says of his limited fame. ``It's
perfect. If I walk into a grocery store, I'm nobody. Michael Jordan
doesn't have that luxury. He gets mobbed. I wouldn't want a life
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament game these folks are playing is known as
duplicate bridge, one of two forms of contract bridge. Contract
bridge has been popular since the 1920s and traces its roots back
to the 16th century. Under its duplicate format, each competing
pair or team plays the same hand, thereby eliminating the luck of
the deal. The other form of contract bridge, known as rubber bridge
or social bridge and played in thousands of living rooms, relies
heavily on chance.
</P>
<P>
   Wander among the tournament tables this week and the first thing
you'll likely notice _ besides the fact that these are not folks
who shop Armani _ is the ages of the players. This is not the
Pokemon crowd. The American Contract Bridge League, a group in
which you are still considered a ``junior'' at age 25, says its
average member is 57 years old. Although the game has become
extremely popular on the youth-infested Internet, it is more likely
to be associated with people who more often might drive golf carts
than Harley-Davidsons. ``The largest concentrations of players live
in retirement communities,'' explained league chief marketing
officer Michael Calhoun. ``Bridge is huge in Florida, huge in
Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always this way. Many of today's players remember
taking up the game in student unions and frat houses during the
1940s and '50s. ``Now it's all television and Nintendos,''
Wei-Sender lamented of modern college life during a break on
Thursday night as she sat in a vast room with about 1,000 other
players. But perhaps the youth market doesn't matter, because
bridge players can apparently play forever once they latch onto the
game. Wei-Sender, in fact, didn't pick up her first cards until she
was 40. ``This is a game that I can play until I'm 100,'' she
beamed.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a game in which, although 60 percent of the league's
members are women, virtually all of the world's top bridge players
are men. Audrey Grant, who has taught the game for 20 years and
written 18 books about bridge, thinks this has happened because
males are given more latitude to focus _ some might say obsess _ on
a single activity. ``It's more fashionable for men to completely
concentrate on something,'' Grant said. ``Women are expected to be
more multifaceted.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jillian Blanchard now thinks there may be something else.
Blanchard, a two-time world champion whose 1984 lawsuit against the
American Contract Bridge League resulted in the fact that women can
now play in what were high-level men's pairs events, once believed
that socialization could indeed explain why the best bridge players
are males. ``I still think those issues apply,'' she said Thursday,
``but I don't think they explain the phenomenon fully. So now I
concede that there are certain biological differences involved. I
just don't know what they are.''
</P>
<P>
   For Karen Verdirame and her partner Elaine Martin, both lawyers
from Omaha, exalted bridge status is highly unlikely. In a world
where it takes 300 points garnered in competitions to win Life
Master status in the United States (Soloway has more points than
anyone: more than 52,000), Verdirame and Martin have earned 31 and
26, respectively. Two years ago, during their first tournament,
Verdirame's initial encounter with a bidding box _ a device filled
with cards that permits silent bidding during competitions _
resulted in her nervously dropping it onto the floor.
</P>
<P>
   But the two women are typical of many lower-level players at
this Boston tournament. They are eager. They are competitive. They
want to get ahead. ``I'd really like to be a Life Master,''
Verdirame mused as she carefully inspected her cards. ``Of course,
I've figured out that, at my current rate, I won't make it until
the year 2050.''

   HIP-HOP-IT-GIRL (New York) _ If you don't recognize the name
Ananda Lewis, it may be because you're older than 23, or not a
hip-hop star, or not a regular supplicant in the land of the velvet
ropes. In the last year, Ms. Lewis has emerged as the hip-hop
generation's reigning It Girl, meaning she is not just an MTV
personality but a woman whose looks and attitude have made her
perpetually indemand at clubs and parties. She is neither singer
nor actress, yet from SoHo to South Beach she consorts with stars

   COLLEGES-REGISTRATION (Undated) _ About 14.8 million students,

million, compared with 980,000 in 1977, the peak year that baby

   DISNEY-MILLENNIUM (Undated) _ For those who cried ``Premature!''
when New York City department stores hauled out the Christmas holly
minutes after the last trick-or-treater made it home for doughnuts
and cider, consider this: At Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla.,
New Year's Eve began on Oct. 1. That day, Mickey Mouse's giant arm
holding an equally outsize ``Sorcerer's Apprentice'' wand, and an
enormous glittering ``2000'' sign, transformed the huge silver
sphere known as Spaceship Earth into a millennial icon. Situated at

fact, he's slapped the faces of everyone from Matt Damon and
Cameron Diaz to Helen Gurley Brown onto the walls of the newest
Palm steakhouse. The Palm, now with 20 restaurants in 17 cities,
dates back to the 1920s, when Bozzi's great-grandfather Pio Bozzi
and a partner, John Ganzi, opened the first one in Kips Bay in
Manhattan. At the time, many cartoonists lived nearby, and since

   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ About 30 years ago, Dr. Elwin Orton,
69, a plant scientist at Rutgers University in New Jersey, set out
to develop a dogwood that would be resistant to the borers that
were devastating the American dogwood, Cornus florida. So he
crossed C. florida with C. kousa, which was introduced from China
in 1904. ``Kousas were not that popular then, because they flower a
month later than our native dogwood, which flowers here about May 1
and is a splendid harbinger of spring,'' said Orton. Kousa dogwoods
also bloom after the branches leaf out, while the native dogwood
opens its bracts on bare branches, making quite a display. By Anne

<HEADLINE>
2000 JAG FOR PEOPLE WHO BUY CARS FOR PERFORMANCE, BUT EXPECT VALUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first entirely new Jaguar model in about 25 years has opened
this premium brand to an entirely different group of consumers: the
kind of people who buy cars more for performance than luxury, but
expect value.
</P>
<P>
   That pretty well describes the 2000 Jag S-Type sports sedan,
which comes in a 3.0-liter V-6 model and a 4.0-liter V-8 model.
Introduced last year, the S-Type competes head-to-head with
comparable sports sedans from Lexus, the six-cylinder GS 300 and
the V-8 GS 400, as well as against the BMW 5-series.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Jaguar and Lexus models have decidedly different
styling, their concepts are virtually identical, which means that
yet another luxury brand is trying to latch onto some of Lexus'
phenomenal success.
</P>
<P>
   With a base price of $42,500 for the 240-horsepower V-6 and
$48,000 for the 281-horsepower V-8, the Jaguar S-Type brings
affordable performance to this segment, just as the GS 300 and 400
did.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most people don't see a $40,000-plus car as
affordable, but when compared with Jaguar's other models _ whose
base prices begin at $55,200 and climb into the $70,000s _ the
S-type comes off looking like a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't drive like a bargain-priced car. Just like the GS
300 and 400, the Jag S-type sedans are more drivers' cars than
passengers' cars, giving their operators more fun than models that
cost a whole bunch more.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked me last week _ during my test drive of the V-8
S-Type _ what performance sedan I would choose if money were no
object.
</P>
<P>
   Three choices: the Mercedes-Benz E55, the Lexus GS 400 or, you
guessed it, the V-8 S-Type.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you can buy sedans that cost a lot more, but these are the
most fun.
</P>
<P>
   I especially like the Jaguar. My car tastes always have been a
bit out of the mainstream, and that's one of the biggest draws of
the Jaguar. It's not for everybody; it's not a car you see every
day.
</P>
<P>
   It looks and drives like a Jag, with the traditional
Jaguar-style grille, smooth power, sure handling and luxurious
interior.
</P>
<P>
   How about quality? That's a good question, considering Jaguar's
reputation over the past two or three decades for poor quality.
</P>
<P>
   The S-Type is the first Jaguar designed and built after the
British automaker's takeover by Ford Motor Co. One of Ford's main
objectives has been to improve Jaguar's quality and restore some of
its prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was the first U.S. automaker to successfully undergo a
quality renaissance, during the late '80s and early '90s, to
compete more effectively against the Japanese car companies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ford is infusing Jaguar with the quality culture, which
should make the S-Type a lot more reliable than some of its
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   That's vital to the S-Type's success, because quality is a major
part of the value that successful, upscale baby-boomers are looking
for _ the reason why Lexus has become the strongest luxury brand in
just 10 years in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this new Jaguar can come close to the quality of a Lexus
remains to be seen, but gauging by the attention to detail
prevalent throughout the vehicle, the S-Type like a contender.
</P>
<P>
   Ford must be pleased with Jaguar's progress in quality control;
it has borrowed the S-Type's chassis for one of its own luxury
cars, the new Lincoln LS. Put them side by side, and it's easy to
spot their similarities. But the trading goes both ways: Jaguar
uses a Ford-derived engine in the V-6 S-Type _ a version of the
engine that comes in the base LS.
</P>
<P>
   For a driver, the S-Type V-8 is is a dream car, even without the
fancy gadgetry included on our test vehicle. There is ample power
when you need it; and even though it's a family sedan, it holds to
the road turns like a sports car.
</P>
<P>
   Leather seats and a leather/polished-wood steering wheel are
among the highlights of the tasteful but not ostentatious interior.
</P>
<P>
   The S-Type seats four people rather comfortably; there are two
bucket seats up front and a contoured bench in the back. Leg, head
and shoulder room are adequate front and rear. A third adult in the
back seat makes things a bit tight, however.
</P>
<P>
   Standard equipment on our test vehicle included a five-speed
automatic transmission with a manual-shift feature, speed-sensitive
power steering, four-wheel antilock disc brakes, traction control,
front and side air bags for the driver and front passenger, front
and rear fog lights, automatic headlights, power windows/door
locks/mirrors (with memory), a trip computer and a moon roof.
</P>
<P>
   There were two cool extras: a GPS satellite navigation system
with built-in video display in the dashboard with a moving map; and
a voice command center. The touch of a button on the steering wheel
activates the voice command functions. Press the button, say
clearly ``FM 98.7'' and a male voice replies: ``Tuning radio to
98-point-7 FM.''
</P>
<P>
   The commands work for playing compact discs or the radio, and
for setting the temperature of the automatic climate control. Just
tell it ``Disc 5, Track 4,'' and it pulls that disc from the
glovebox-mounted CD changer and goes to the correct track.
</P>
<P>
   My only disappointment: The voice that verifies your selection
doesn't have a British accent. Bummer.
</P>
<P>
   The options on our test car were the deluxe communications
package ($4,300), which included the GPS navigation and the voice
command center; a premium audio system, including the CD changer
($1,500); and a weather/sport package ($2,300). Total sticker price
was $56,710, including $580 transportation.
</P>

GARDEN COLUMN: A BREEDER RECALLS THE MAJESTIC DOGWOOD TO LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 30 years ago, Dr. Elwin Orton, a plant scientist at
Rutgers University, set out to develop a dogwood that would be
resistant to the borers that were devastating the American dogwood,
Cornus florida.
</P>
<P>
   So he crossed C. florida with C. kousa, which was introduced
from China in 1904.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kousas were not that popular then, because they flower a month
later than our native dogwood, which flowers here about May 1 and
is a splendid harbinger of spring,'' said Orton, 69, standing in a
windy field at the Rutgers experimental farm in New Brunswick, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Kousa dogwoods also bloom after the branches leaf out, while the
native dogwood opens its bracts on bare branches, making quite a
display. The American tree also has a more graceful shape, I think,
with low, spreading branches, while the Asian tree is multitrunked,
more upright and densely branched. After about 20 years, though,
kousas develop a more spreading form, and their bark is beautifully
mottled.
</P>
<P>
   And some of Orton's hybrids have grown into beautiful monsters.
Cornus Rutlan Ruth Ellen, for instance, stands a good 20 feet tall
and 30 feet across after 30 years. And its branches, so thick with
ruddy leaves, were full of fat gray buds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about floriferous!'' said Orton, as proud as any father.
``In spring, the bracts are the purest white. You stand here on a
sunny day and you have to squint.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Ellen is one of six Rutgers-patented hybrids that are now
being grown by commercial wholesale nurseries and that are
available at retail nurseries. All are resistant to the dogwood
borer and to dogwood anthracnose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kousa does not get the borer,'' said Orton, who thinks that
the tree's smooth bark makes it difficult for borers to lay eggs.
The American dogwood's rough bark, though, offers nice little
crevices for eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Orton crossed the plants in 1969, waited a year for the seeds to
germinate, nursed the seedlings another year, then planted the
young whips in a field with no irrigation. Talk about feeding your
young to the wolves. It took eight years for most of the hundreds
of seedlings to flower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost gave up hope,'' said Orton. ``I'd get only one flower
one year, then one branch the next, two branches the next. Finally,
a whole tree bloomed.''
</P>
<P>
   And just as he had hoped, the hybrid was as resistant to the
borer as the kousa parent. It's also larger than either parent,
with dark green, glossy leaves.
</P>
<P>
   As his young trees got going in the 1980s, the fungus that
causes dogwood anthracnose showed up in Connecticut and made its
way through Long Island, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and down through
the Appalachian Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was devastating,'' Orton said. ``Foresters said they would
go through the woods where Cornus florida is native and not find
any seedlings.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came a succession of cold winters and wet springs, then
droughts in summer, and dogwoods went into a severe decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landscape architects just will not plant C. florida in the
landscape anymore,'' Orton said. ``So kousa was suddenly thrust
into the limelight, and nurserymen couldn't grow them fast
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Ellen is the first of the six patented hybrids to bloom,
around June 1, just as florida dogwoods stop blooming.
</P>
<P>
   Stardust, which has the same low, horizontal branching as Ruth
Ellen, is smaller and so heavily branched that it looks like a
hedge. It blooms about a day after Ruth Ellen starts blooming. The
original plant now stands about 18 feet tall and a sprawling 27
feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   The other four are all more upright in habit, though without the
vase shape of a kousa. And they all bloom within six days of Ruth
Ellen.
</P>
<P>
   Constellation branches low and wide from top to bottom. The
original tree was 25 feet tall and 18 feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   Celestial is vigorous and erect, with a uniform width. The
floral bracts, which open about five days after Ruth Ellen's, are
white with a tinge of green and form a small cup when first opened.
Then they flatten out and turn white. The one I saw was 25 feet by
19 feet, and it had a nice, dark greenish-purple leaf with a tinge
of orange.
</P>
<P>
   The others are Aurora, which is very floriferous, and Stellar
Pink, which has rounded, overlapping bracts of soft pink. These two
are about 20 feet tall and just as wide.
</P>
<P>
   Dogwoods, by the way, grow fuller in sun. Orton advises mulching
with wood chips to the drip line of the tree, rather than planting
grass. The grass robs the shallow-rooted tree of water, and mowers
often get too close to the trunk, cutting the bark and providing
entry to disease.
</P>
<P>
   Orton has yet to name a seventh hybrid, which seems to be the
dark horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, we realized this seventh was as good or
better shape than any of the other six,'' he said. The unnamed
beauty stands about 18 feet tall and a bit wider. I want one.

BUSH OUTLINES FOREIGN POLICY VIEWS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ George W. Bush outlined a broad-strokes
foreign policy Friday whose bedrock principle is that free trade
will promote free economies, which will in turn encourage
democracies that promote freedom and protect human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic freedom creates habits of liberty, and habits of
liberty create expectations of democracy,'' Bush said at the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Library . ``Trade freely with China, and time
is on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   While former Secretary of State George Shultz, a Bush adviser,
and former first lady Nancy Reagan looked on, Bush laced his speech
with allusions to the rhetoric of Reagan and his father, former
President Bush, the governor outlined a post-Cold War vision of
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is different from the trumpet call of the Cold War. We
are no longer fighting a great enemy, we are asserting a great
principle,'' Bush said. ``We are defending the nobility of normal
lives, lived in obedience to God and conscience, not to
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush warned his rivals on the right against isolationism,
calling it ``a shortcut to chaos. ... The vacuum left by America's
retreat would invite challenges to our power. And the result, in
the long run, would be a stagnant America and a savage world.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush repeated his vow ``never (to) place U.S. troops
under U.N. command,'' he also said that a future Bush
administration would ``pay its (U.N.) dues _ but only if the U.N.'s
bureaucracy is reformed and our disproportionate share of its costs
is reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his broad strategic vision would _ in a jab at the
Clinton administration _ keep the United States from drifting from
``crisis to crisis like a cork in a current.'' He said a president
should set his own priorities, not have them set by adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``An American president should work with our strong democratic
allies in Europe and Asia to extend the peace. He should promote a
fully democratic Western Hemisphere, bound by free trade. He should
defend America's interests in the Persian Gulf and advance peace in
the Middle East, based upon a secure Israel. He must check the
contagious spread of weapons of mass destruction and the means to
deliver them. He must lead toward a world that trades in freedom,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was so broad in its outline and so short on specific
solutions to the global troubles he enumerated that it could raise
more questions than answers about his international credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would address the details of ``these
responsibilities as the campaign continues.''
</P>
<P>
   With that statement, Bush opened himself to further questioning
on his knowledge of foreign affairs as well as how he would handle
some issues. One of the biggest doubts about Bush's ability to be
president, as it has been for other governors seeking the White
House, has been whether he has the depth and experience in foreign
relations to lead the world.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Ginsberg, a Gore adviser, challenged Bush's assertion that
the Clinton administration foreign policy was adrift, saying the
GOP challenger had not offered specific evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps talking about these generalities,'' said Ginsberg,
former U.S. ambassador to Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor said the United States should recognize
India's growing economic power and increase trade with that nation
without sacrificing a traditional friendship with neighboring
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush did not discuss what role, if any, the United States
should have on lessening the military tensions between the two
nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the leaders of India and Pakistan were two of the
questions Bush could not answer in a recent reporter's pop quiz.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush said he would work with European democracies to
extend peace, Bush was slow earlier this year to embrace the
Clinton administration's military action to halt Serb aggression in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders had said the Kosovo intervention was needed to
guarantee regional stability. Bush in his speech gave little
definition to what would constitute a ``crisis'' and what would
constitute a strategic interest.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Bush said he supports free trade with China and
its entrance in the World Trade Organization. But he said he also
would push China to improve its human rights record, especially
noting the government is an ``enemy of religious freedom'' that
sponsors forced abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am president, China will know that America's values are
always part of America's agenda,'' Bush said. ``Our advocacy of
human freedom is not a formality of diplomacy, it is a fundamental
commitment of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   However, earlier this week when a CNN reporter asked Bush
whether he would support trade treaties with nations like China
that require ``accountability'' for the use of slave labor and poor
environmental practices, Bush said he would support such treaties
only so long as they did not ``undermine free trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush twice swiped the Clinton administration's China policy. He
vowed that ``never again would an American president'' spend nine
days in China without stopping at any of the capitals of America's
regional allies.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsberg said none of the Asian allies have complained about
Clinton's attention to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is he trying to create a problem that doesn't exist?,''
said Ginsberg. ``This is a lot of empty bold rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also noted that Clinton had both called Chinese leaders the
``butcher of Beijing'' to valuing the nation as a ``strategic
partner.'' Bush said China's record on military growth, nuclear
proliferation and human rights should keep it from being viewed as
a strategic partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is a competitor, not a strategic partner,'' Bush said.
``We must deal with China without ill will, but without
illusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bush said the United States will support economic and
democratic growth in Russia, but he threatened to cut off aid from
``international lending institutions'' if the Russian continues
attacks on civilians in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Bush repeated his opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty on nuclear weapons, which has the support of the Clinton
administration and European leaders. Bush said the treaty does
nothing to stop proliferation, especially among rogue nations.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush offered no alternative to the treaty. He said the
United States should make it a priority with Russia and China to
``constrict the supply of nuclear materials and the means to
deliver them'' without outlining a plan to achieve that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said this nation needs to convince Russia that is in both
countries' interest to change the anti-ballistic missile treaty so
that both countries can develop anti-missile defense systems to
defend against the ``mutual threat of rogue nations.'' Bush also
said theater-based systems should be developed to protect allies
such as Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation must diminish the evil attraction of these
(nuclear) weapons for rogue states by rendering the useless with
missile defense,'' Bush said.

MIND CONTROL RESEARCHER PLACED ON LEAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A State University of New York at Albany
professor whose research on government mind control was shut down
last spring is now on paid leave, university officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But citing confidentiality concerns, they would not say if
psychology professor Kathryn Kelley was suspended by the university
or took the leave voluntarily. University spokeswoman Mary Fiess
also declined on Thursday to divulge the reason for the absence,
which began Monday.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY-Albany's Institutional Review Board had previously closed a
research project of Kelley's after a student complained about not
being able to leave a lecture that was part of her experiment.
Federal guidelines strictly prohibit researchers from forcing
subjects to engage in their work.
</P>
<P>
   The project, according to a 16-page outline Kelley provided the
board, was aimed at exploring the uses of technology for
``monitoring and control.'' In subsequent papers and talks at
conferences, Kelley, a professor at the university since 1979,
examined the claims of those who said they were implanted with
devices that could read their thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   At a summer conference in Orlando, Fla., she described how a
subject under anesthesia could be implanted with a device called a
``RAAT,'' short for radio wave, auditory, assaultive, transmitting
implants.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (short wave) operators transmit to or scan RAAT implants
in victims, they can talk to victims remotely and anonymously, and
hear the victim's speech and thoughts,'' Kelley wrote.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, she said that the Department of Defense and
the National Security
</P>
<P>
   Agency funded implant technology aimed at ``federal prisoners
and political dissidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Currently making a salary of $67,000, Kelley was teaching two
courses before she began her
</P>
<P>
   leave. The courses, as well as the graduate students she
advised, have been re-assigned to
</P>
<P>
   other faculty, Fiess said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley's research is a sensitive issue at the university, coming
four years after a gunman,
</P>
<P>
   claiming the government planted microchips in his body, held a
class hostage. Ralph Tortorici,
</P>
<P>
   the gunman, recently hanged himself in his state prison cell.

LET US GIVE THANKS FOR FAITH IN ITS MANY FORMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What are we thankful for on Thanksgiving? A new survey by
Yankelovich Partners indicates that we Americans are most thankful
for our families.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, commissioned by the Lutheran Brotherhood, states
that among the 1,000 people surveyed in September, 53 percent to 62
percent listed family as tops on their list.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller percentages said they are most thankful for good health,
friends, education, finances, a harmonious relationship with a
spouse, the happiness of their children and a nurturing religious
faith.
</P>
<P>
   To me, Thanksgiving is a great holiday because Buddhists,
Baptists, Coptics, Catholics, Methodists, Disciples, members of the
Church of Christ, Lutherans, Unitarians, Congregationalists,
Anglicans, Jews, Muslims, Presbyterians, Pentecostals, Mormons,
Hindus, Jains, Zoroastrians, Bahais and people of other faiths can
celebrate it in peace together.
</P>
<P>
   I am grateful for my family, too. And for my friends, my health
and many other things _ including my work as a journalist, which
has allowed me to meet obscure and famous figures who illustrate
the best in the world's great religions.
</P>
<P>
   When I met the Dalai Lama and Cardinal Joseph Bernardin at the
Parliament of World Religions in Chicago in 1993, I was astounded
by how much they possessed some of the same qualities.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama, of course, is the world's most famous Buddhist,
and the late Cardinal Bernardin was an internationally renowned and
respected Roman Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the two men's obvious differences, they possessed the
openness, kindness, humility, love, compassion and sincerity I've
always associated with the forgiving and humble carpenter from
Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   That same sort of personality was present in the ex-Archbishop
of Canterbury Robert Runcie, the former leader of the worldwide
Anglican Communion, who left his chair to greet me and another
reporter one morning before he spoke at Thanks-Giving Square in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Although some Americans have the greatly mistaken impression
that all Muslims are terrorists, I have been impressed by the
kindly and hospitable people who have helped me learn more about
Islam. The very word ``Islam'' means peace.
</P>
<P>
   My contacts in the Jewish faith have shown the same kind of
peaceful ``shalom.'' The eloquence and spiritual depth of Rabbi
Harold S. Kushner, the famous author, and other rabbis and lay
people I know here in Texas have inspired me repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   And I felt warmly welcomed when I was once included in a family
Passover dinner with one of my Jewish news sources.
</P>
<P>
   Baptists make headlines over their denominational controversies,
but many of the most peaceful and loving individuals are members of
that faith.
</P>
<P>
   One of the privileges of my life is to have known the late T.B.
Maston, a pioneer in racial ethics at Southwestern Baptist
Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, who exhibited the walk of Jesus
as well as any person I've known.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Rev. Billy Graham, whom I've interviewed
one-on-one on two memorable occasions, has the same kind of
qualities that Maston, the Dalai Lama and Cardinal Bernardin
exhibited.
</P>
<P>
   Although I've never spoken to Pope John Paul II, I feel that I
almost know this warm, courageous and humble spirit I have seen
blessing people in Rome, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Mexico and San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Hindu leader Mohandas ``Mahatma'' Gandhi was a charismatic
revolutionary who openly admired the nonviolent teachings of Jesus,
and illustrated the spiritual qualities we associate with the best
in religion.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., a Baptist minister, borrowed
from both Gandhi and Jesus in leading the 1960s civil rights
revolution in America.
</P>
<P>
   The people who gave us Thanksgiving, the Puritans, fled England
and continental Europe partly to escape religious persecution. And
though they enforced their own brand of religious intolerance for a
time, their successors forged a Constitution that allowed
unprecedented religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   On this last Thanksgiving Day before 2000, let us give thanks
that we can choose a variety of paths to God _ so different and yet
so similar.

SENATE CRACKS DOWN ON `DATE-RAPE' DRUG 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANDREW BROMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate approved a bill Friday to crack down on
abusers of so-called ``date-rape'' drugs, legislation named for
girls from Michigan and Texas who died after consuming drug-laced
soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   If signed into law, the bill would put gamma hydroxybutyric acid
_ an orderless drug that can be made at home _ in the same category
as hard drugs, such as cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most important pieces of legislation to
pass the Senate,'' said Sen. Spencer Abraham, a Michigan Republican
who sponsored the bill. ``These date-rape drugs are wreaking havoc
on our youth. It's time to crack down on those sexual predators
that use them.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar measure breezed through the House last month, 423-1.
Only Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, voted against the bill, saying the
federal government has no constitutional authority to regulate drug
use. The Senate bill passed by a voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   A few drops of the colorless, odorless substance in a soft drink
can render the consumer unconscious in less than a half-hour.
Victims frequently have no memory of what happened. The drug is
difficult to trace and leaves the body within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade, at least 32 deaths have been linked to
GHB. The Drug Enforcement Administration, which supports the
legislation, reported that more than 3,500 people have overdosed on
the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would make it illegal to possess GHB with the intent to
manufacture, distribute or dispense it. The crime could bring up to
20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Exceptions would be made for GHB clinical studies approved by
the Food and Drug Administration to determine if the drug helps
with medical problems such as narcolepsy, a sleeping disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was named for two girls who died after consuming
the drug. One was 17-year-old Hillory Farias of La Porte, Texas,
who died 1996. The other was a 15-year old Michigan girl, Samantha
Reid, whose January death was blamed on GHB.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham's bill is almost identical to the House version, which
was sponsored by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Senate aides said the two bills are similar enough that the
House probably will go along with Abraham's version and send it to
President Clinton for his signature.

HEALING PROCESS BEGINS DAY AFTER JASPER CASE ENDS 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ As Shawn Berry began his first full day of a
life prison sentence Friday, relatives of dragging victim James
Byrd Jr. gathered to place flowers at his grave in the Jasper City
Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We place this wreath as a symbol of the healing process, not
just for our family but for the Jasper community and the world,''
said Mylinda Washington, one of Byrd's six sisters. ``Hopefully it
will bring closure for this phase of justice for James.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice for James,'' said a ribbon on the black, white and red
wreath. ``Rest in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry, 24, was the third of three white men convicted of capital
murder for chaining Byrd, a 49-year-old disabled black man, behind
a pickup tand dragging him for three miles along back country roads
early on June 7, 1998. His mangled, headless body was found in
front of a black cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Juries in Jasper and Bryan sentenced Bill King, 25, and Russell
Brewer Jr., 32, to death. On Thursday, a third jury in Jasper
sentenced Berry to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Byrd Jr. said the world would know he had lived on
earth,'' said Byrd's sister, Clara Taylor. ``We have seen justice
for James in this case. Three white individuals were prosecuted to
the extent of the law for killing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at a gathering of news reporters and photographers who
witnessed the ceremony, she said, ``So James Byrd Jr. was and is
somebody, and the legal system felt the same way. Now we feel he
has been vindicated and avenged.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sister, Louvon Harris, read one of the many poems the
family has been sent from around the world. ``On Nov. 18 our
mission was completed,'' she read. ``Justice for James was once
again repeated.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members joined in as Byrd's niece, Farshanda Boatner,
sang ``I Believe I Can Fly,'' one of his favorite songs.
</P>
<P>
   Berry is expected to remain at Huntsville's James Byrd
Diagnostic Unit _ named for a deceased prison warden _ for several
weeks before being assigned to another prison unit.
</P>
<P>
   Prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald said he will be kept in a
solitary cell for his own protection. He will be eligible for
parole consideration in 40 years.

   NEW YORK _ When he isn't seating guests, Bruce Bozzi is slapping
celebrities. In the last few months, in fact, he's slapped the
faces of everyone from Matt Damon and Cameron Diaz to Helen Gurley
Brown onto the walls of the newest Palm steakhouse, in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The faces are drawn by Bronwyn Bird, an illustrator with an
old-fashioned touch, and when the old-fashioned-looking steakhouse
is empty in the mornings, Bozzi, whose family owns the place, walks
around _ part curator, part child playing pin the tail on the
donkey _ deciding where to put them.
</P>
<P>
   Recently he slapped Alfonse D'Amato and Roseanne Barr up next to
a less than venerated spot by the kitchen door. ``They're two
outspoken people who belong there together,'' he said. Ivana Trump,
meanwhile, is on a column facing Donald Trump. ``I was going to put
her right next to her ex-hubby,'' Bozzi explained, ``but then I
realized it would be better to have her staring him down from a
respectful distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Turner is by the bar. ``Everything about her tells me
that she belongs in a bar,'' said Bozzi, who had the honor of
showing the smoky-voiced actress her portrait not long ago. (She
told him, ``Well, at least it looks like me.'')
</P>
<P>
   For obvious reasons, Bozzi put Gwyneth Paltrow, the muse of
Miramax, near Harvey Weinstein. But then he slapped Diane Von
Furstenberg between them for the heck of it. ``They're all in the
power area together, above the booths, with Spike Lee and Steven
Spielberg,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Dining at the Palm is not a prerequisite for having one's
likeness on the wall.) ``I put Georgette Moss-whatever-her-name-is
up there, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because the faces at the Palm aren't reverentially
framed as they are at Sardi's, but randomly glued to the walls with
an impetuous, childlike abandon, they have an almost comforting
effect. They are more like patron saints than envy-producing power
moguls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each wall is like a friendly little village that's taking on a
life of its own,'' Bozzi said.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm, now with 20 restaurants in 17 cities, including the
summer city of East Hampton, dates back to the 1920s, when Bozzi's
great-grandfather Pio Bozzi and a partner, John Ganzi, opened the
first one in Kips Bay in Manhattan. At the time, many cartoonists
lived nearby, and since times were tough, they paid for meals by
drawing caricatures of famous people on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   As the years passed, those who were caricatured started asking
to be portrayed more attractively. ``Just the other day, I had an
old-time customer from Second Avenue ask me if he could send an
artist in to touch up the hair on his portrait,'' Bozzi said. ``I
told him, ` D'Angelo, of course you can!' Hey, if you're on the
wall, you want to look good, right?''
</P>
<P>
   His wall policy is strict but not unyielding. Sure, he might
tell you, if you asked how (italics)you(end italics) could get your
portrait up, that all you have to do is come for dinner a couple
hundred times.
</P>
<P>
   But he might also decide that you belong up there with the high
and mighty just because you're a friend or a helpful colleague or a
William Morris agent named Lou Weiss, who saw a portrait of himself
unveiled at his retirement lunch there last September. Despite his
benign nature, Bozzi won't deny that it's a power trip to be in
charge of placement for an ever-evolving exhibition of power icons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when I get jealous of them,'' he said, ``it feels
good to slap their faces around.''

TAKE `RKO 281' WITH A GRAIN OF SALT AND ENJOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
RKO 281 
Starring: Liev Schreiber, James Cromwell, John Malkovich, Melanie
Griffith, Brenda Blethyn, Fiona Shaw 
Directed by: Benjamin Ross 
On: HBO 
Time: Saturday at 8 p.m. 
Rated: TVMA 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nowadays, when we like a movie, or a rock icon, or a TV show, we
want to know the real story behind it. That desire for dish, or for
historical background if you prefer, has fueled an industry of
documentary and docudramatic TV that reaches from PBS to A&AMP;E to E!,
where ``The E! True Hollywood Story'' delights in going deep on
what really went down on ``Bewitched.'' Of course, many of the
tabloid legends transmitted through shows like ``Behind the Music''
and movies like ``Come On Get Happy: The Partridge Family Story''
are fictional, juicy tales that have been embellished and distorted
over the years. But still, they can be fun to watch, when taken
with a grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what ``RKO 281'' is, during its best moments: hokey,
cartoonish fun, and not for viewers on low-sodium diets. The HBO
movie purports to tell the story of the making of ``Citizen Kane,''
particularly the war of the worlds between Orson Welles and William
Randolph Hearst. Like most of HBO's biographical movies, from
``Winchell'' to ``The Rat Pack,'' it is light on reliable facts and
long on superficial characterizations, familiar biopic dialogue,
and overly condensed plotting. But it is nonetheless an absorbing
90 minutes of TV, with colorful casting choices _ notably John
Malkovich, who brings a pained resignation to his drunken Herman
Mankiewicz _ and sumptuous sets (by TV standards) that mimic those
of ``Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the big fabrications of ``RKO 281,'' which is named after
the ``Kane'' production number, is a visit by Welles to San Simeon,
Hearst's famous castle. Looking at the hollow halls, and Hearst's
lonely mistress, actress Marion Davies, Welles supposedly comes up
with the idea for his great movie. After prodding from Welles,
Mankiewicz agrees to write the script, and we then watch the script
go back and forth between the men enough to fudge the still argued
question of who deserves the most writing credit. But the movie's
more central drama comes when Hearst finds out that ``Kane'' is
based on his life, and he does all he can to destroy it, including
threatening to out studio honchos as Jews. Ultimately, as we know,
``Citizen Kane'' is released to critical acclaim and box office
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Liev Schreiber, who has shown great promise in movies like
``A Walk on the Moon'' and ``The Daytrippers,'' underplays the
Welles we're familiar with _ the arrogant, manipulative,
self-sabotaging boy wonder _ and he gets it just right. James
Cromwell's Hearst is a cool cucumber who is sympathetic when his
privacy is invaded, but repugnant when he childishly exerts his
will over Hollywood and Louella Parsons. And Melanie Griffith, all
red lipstick and little-girl voice, accomplishes a surprising
amount in her few scenes as Davies. She seems to be the only
character with any heart and integrity.

TIME FOR INVESTOR TO SEE A TAX EXPERT

 (For release Sunday, November 21, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a 32-year-old father of two (ages 19 months and 3
months) and my wife has stopped working to care for our children.
Our combined investment portfolio is $190,000, to which we try to
add $2,500 per month and an additional $25,000 a year from bonuses
and $14,000 a year through IRA and 401(k) contributions. My salary
is $200,000. We have no debt beyond our mortgage. Will we have
enough to send our children to college, retire, and take care of
unexpected expenses? Is our portfolio too risky or too concentrated
in stocks for our age?
</P>
<P>
   R.D., Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Will you have enough money? Is the Atlantic wet? Of course;
you'll be in lovely shape if you keep saving at your current annual
$69,000 level. Not only are you building what will be a lordly
retirement savings pool, but the chances are that you're
overfunding the savings for the childrens' college educations.
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio breakdown you supplied shows a total of $16,000 a
year going into the college savings accounts, which have a $13,100
current balance. That would represent an accumulation of $661,836
over the next 16 years if you achieved average 10 percent
investment returns. The newly issued year 2000 issue of Paying for
College Without Going Broke projects college expenses increasing at
a 5 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying the numbers a little further out than they do, this
would mean that the cost of a private college education would be
$46,264 in 16 years, when your older child might enter college,
then escalating to $59,299 in 22 years, when you might expect your
younger child to graduate. The combined total of those eight years
of estimated college tuition, room and board, and fees comes to
$421,081. If you reduced your monthly college savings to $800 a
month, you would have all of the money for both children saved by
the time the first enters college, using the same assumptions as
above.
</P>
<P>
   As for your retirement accounts, based on the same growth
assumptions and contributions of $4,416 a month, you would
accumulate $12,204,483 over 30 years. If inflation averaged 3.5
percent during those 30 years, that accumulation would have the
buying power of a little more than $4.3 million in current dollars,
which would be more than ample to provide an income stream equal to
or greater than the amount you now spent and to provide a handsome
level of capital growth as a buffer against inflation in your later
years. And of course, if you either diverted some of the college
savings to your retirement portfolio, or if you put the funds now
being saved as college money into your retirement savings after
your childrens' college years begin, your accumulation would be
considerable greater _ enough so that you could probably retire
well before age 62 which I randomly) selected for my calculations.
</P>
<P>
   As for the portfolio, I like it. Your tax-deferred accounts are
in a nice array, dominated by growth and income and equity income
funds. I'd like to see some fairly small positions in small-cap,
mid-cap and health care funds in there also, but there's nothing
terribly wrong with your selections. The taxable accounts are
mostly common stock positions, roughly divided between blue chips
and technology issues. Very nicely done.
</P>
<P>
   My main suggestion is that unless the ambitious savings schedule
you outline is likely to be more a dream than a reality, you would
probably profit handsomely by paying a visit to a tax lawyer fairly
soon. Portfolios that will become this large have the potential to
cause huge tax headaches, and since the largest segment of your
savings _ $39,000 a year _ is going into taxable accounts, this
effect will grow steadily worse. Vehicles such as variable
annuities could be used to balance the taxable and tax-deferred
savings (although I'e been getting negative feedback lately from
people who don't like these tax-deferred vehicles). And at some
point it will certainly make sense for you to put some of your
taxable savings in tax-exempt mutual bonds or in mutual funds that
invest in them. In short, what I'm saying is that you've done a
nice job of building and diversifying this portfolio, but sooner
than later you'll want tax experts to focus on your savings plan.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I find your columns about retirement alarming because they
usually seem to be from affluent people with hundreds of thousands
in assets. I feel that if they are worried, I should be frantic. My
wife and I have a combined income of $60,000 to $65,000 a year,
plus $1,000 a month from the Veterans Administration. Our home will
be paid for in 12 years, which is when I would like to retire. We
are both state workers and will have pensions and low-cost health
insurance. I am putting $8,000 a year into deferred compensation.
Our current assets are $8,000 in savings and $26,000 in deferred
compensation. Is retirement for me and my wife (who would retire
eight to ten years later) a probability?
</P>
<P>
   R.S., Newburyport, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure. What you are overlooking here is that most of these
people who write in describing their six-figure (and higher)
savings have accumulated these pools instead of pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you and your wife anticipate getting pensions which will
bring you a combined income stream of $43,750, or 70 percent of the
median income level you mentioned. If you had to produce such an
income stream on your own, and if you anticipated living for 30
years after retirement, you would need a pool of $589,844 to do the
trick. So while you don't have those big six-figure accumulations,
you not only have the equivalent, but you probably also have a
cost-of-living adjustment built into the pensions, which make them
even more valuable. And your low-cost health insurance is also
worth many thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   So no need to be frantic _ you have provided for your
retirement, but its simply in a different form than many peoples'
savings is. And speaking of six-figure sums, if you keep plugging
away at that deferred compensation plan at your current rate,
you'll be there too. I don't know how this money is invested, but
if average annual returns were 6.5 percent, 8 percent or 10
percent, you would accumulate $198,474, $222,872, or $260,537,
respectively, after 12 years.

THOUSANDS PROTEST CLINTON'S TRIP TO GREECE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ President Clinton arrived in this cradle of
democracy Friday proclaiming himself ``a friend of Greece,'' but
thousands of leftists clashed with police to protest his visit, and
heavy security brought parts of the city to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   Greek television provided split screen coverage of Air Force One
touching down and Clinton speaking at the Eillinikon International
Airport while anarchists and communists threw rocks and set fires
elsewhere in protest of U.S. involvement in Yugoslavia. Banks and
shops fronts in the main commercial area were damaged, and fires
blazed. Police launched tear gas canisters to stop protesters'
march to the U.S. Embassy in central Athens.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasting scenes presented pictures the Greek government
of Prime Minister Costas Simitis hoped to avoid. The White House
previously postponed and scaled back Clinton's visit because of
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The president spent five days in rival Turkey, where a European
security session occurred in Istanbul. Protocol required that he
also visit Athens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you all for coming out to greet us,'' Clinton told 100
well-wishers who greeted the first family with waving U.S. flags.
``I have come here as a phili mou, a friend of Greece. And I look
forward to experiencing that wonderful quality of Greek hospitality
known to all the world as phyloxenia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Athens airport closed for one hour before Air Force One's
arrival as the White House and the Greek government took
extraordinary precautions. The major route and side streets from
the airport to Clinton's hotel were closed to all traffic and lined
with hundreds of police and soldiers hours before his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Wire services reported 7,000 Greek troops and 400 federal agents
were stationed throughout the city. U.S. reporters were warned to
expect unusually heavy security during the president's 22 hour
visit in Athens and at remaining stops in Italy, Bulgaria,
Macedonia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rondos, an adviser to the Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou, downplayed the protest to U.S. reporters, classifying
the demonstration as mild by Greek standards and not representative
of the support for Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 5,000 people at most in a city of 4 million,''
Rondos said, adding that probably fewer than 100 were involved in
the melee with police, though television reports appeared to show a
larger crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Local reports put the number at 200, mostly anarchists, who are
an organized political party here. Police arrested 32 people.
Fifteen people were injured and more than 60 stores damaged. Smoke
from tear gas and fires, which burned for hours, filled the air of
the ancient port city.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton never saw the anti-American demonstration. Earlier in
the day, protesters posted two giant banners reading ``Killer
Clinton'' on a mountainside.
</P>
<P>
   Greek leftists, who have a tradition of protest, took to the
streets to complain about the U.S.-led bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia and in support of ethnic Albania Muslims in Kosovo. But
anti-American feelings run high among many Greeks. They share a
Christian Orthodox religion with Yugoslavia's Serb majority.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit also came near the date marked by Greeks to
commemorate the Nov. 17, 1973, attack against students by a
military junta. Greeks believe the United States backed the
military dictatorship. November 17 also is the name of a shadowy
terrorist group that has killed nearly two dozen people.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek government banned protests around the U.S. Embassy,
the president's hotel and other locations where the president will
appear in hopes of quelling disturbances. Clinton attended a state
dinner hosted by President Constantinos Stephanopoulos without
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in Turkey, Clinton told reporters he was delighted to be
going to Greece. ``I'm not concerned about the protests,'' the
president said. ``I know that a lot of people in Greece disagree
with my position on Kosovo, and they have a right to their opinion
and I have a right to mine. I believe I was right, and I think the
facts have proved that I was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left Istanbul following a two-day summit for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which sought
to pressure Russia to stop its indiscriminate attacks on citizens
in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty of the 54 members in the OSCE, including Clinton, signed
a revised Conventional Forces in Europe treaty that would require
Russia to withdraw troops from Georgia and Moldova. The revision is
the first to recognize the new post-Soviet era. The 1990 treaty was
intended to reduce the threat of war between the West's North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Soviet's Warsaw Pact.
</P>
<P>
   The CFE treaty initially set limits of 40,000 battle tanks,
60,000 armored combat vehicles, 40,000 pieces of artillery, 13,600
combat aircraft and 4,000 attack helicopters. The revised treaty
would cut those numbers by half in an attempt to reduce the spread
of internal conflicts, according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also warned Russia he would not submit the revised
Conventional Forces in Europe treaty to the Senate for approval
until Russia completes its reductions in the Northern Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   The revised treaty, signed by Russia, also strengthens the
requirement that host nations must consent to foreign troop
deployments _ a provision intended to bolster the interests of the
former Soviet republics such as Ukraine, Georgia, Maldova and
Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov joined other OSCE members
in approving a charter revision that states OSCE has an interest in
any internal conflict that threatens regional stability. OSCE
members also approved a declaration in which Russia agreed to allow
OSCE to visit Chechnya to see if a political settlement was
possible. Russia made no pledge to halt its two-month campaign
against Islamic rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent much of his official visit in Turkey urging the
nation to reconcile with the Greeks and to resolve their dispute
over Cypress. The two rivals have cooperated extensively in wake of
earthquakes in both nations.
</P>
<P>
   The protests against the United States have been rare during
Clinton's tenure as president. Clinton usually receives a warm
reception for foreigners eager to see the U.S. leader.

   COXNET NASCAR 1119: AWESOME BILL'S POPULARITY: Our fearless
reporter uncovers facts on why Bill Elliott -- Awesome Bill from
Dawsonville -- wins NASCAR's Most Popular Driver award every year.
Simple: The good folks from Dawsonville, Ga., keep finding ways to
stuff the ballot box. In fact, NASCAR has changed the system four
times in an effort to prevent Elliott from dominating the vote. But
Dawsonville residents go to great lengths to find ways to make
their man, No. 1. And he'll probably win the award again this year.

Saturday, Nov. 20, sent to computer graphics clients of The New

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, barometric pressure and wind observations from
aircraft reconnaissance prompted forecasters at the National
Hurricane Center to downgrade Hurricane Lenny to a tropical storm.
Saturday, the weakened system will continue an erratic drift to the
east.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rain will dampen the Pacific Northwest as ocean winds
transport moisture inland. The heaviest rains, which will amount to
modest totals of an inch or less, will occur on west-facing slopes
of the Coastal Range and Cascades in Washington and Oregon as moist
winds are forced to ascend the sloping terrain. Accumulating snows
will fall in the mountains of northern Idaho and northwest Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Showers will escort a cool front from the eastern Great Lakes to
the central Gulf Coast on Saturday. With moisture flowing freely
from the Gulf of Mexico and a jet stream disturbance trailing the
cold front, a few thunderstorms, some with brief downpours, will
develop from the lower Mississippi Valley into the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north along the front, rains should be generally
lighter, owing to a decline in the availability of moisture.
However, a second jet stream disturbance trailing the cold front
could help to enhance rainfalls across the eastern Great Lakes,
particularly in southwest New York and northwest Pennsylvania,
where moisture gleaned from Lake Erie and Lake Ontario will play a
role.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the cool front, Pacific air will spread over the
upper Middle West, but modified Arctic air will stay locked over
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: LAST SUNSET
</P>
<P>
   Friday, at 1:21 p.m. Alaskan time, the sun set over the village
of Barrow and it will not rise again until 1:15 p.m. on January 23,
2000. Located within the Arctic circle at latitude 71 degrees,
Barrow houses the nation's northernmost weather station. Each
autumn, as the northern hemisphere increasingly tilts away from the
sun, more and more of the Arctic Circle, which extends from the
North Pole to latitude 66.5 degrees, becomes cast in darkness. The
hyperborean darkness of winter within the Arctic Circle lasts six
months at the North Pole and about two months at Barrow's latitude.

   For those who cried ``Premature!'' when New York City department
stores hauled out the Christmas holly minutes after the last
trick-or-treater made it home for doughnuts and cider, consider
this: At Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., New Year's Eve began
on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   That day, Mickey Mouse's giant arm holding an equally outsize
``Sorcerer's Apprentice'' wand, and an enormous glittering ``2000''
sign, transformed the huge silver sphere known as Spaceship Earth
into a millennial icon.
</P>
<P>
   Situated at the entrance to Epcot _ the World's Fair-style theme
park that opened near Disney's Magic Kingdom in 1982 _ the oversize
metallic golf ball has become the focal point of millennium
celebrations at Walt Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Its New Year's ball doesn't drop as the one in that other Disney
World _ Times Square _ does every Dec. 31; it just sort of sits
there and glimmers. But it's a photo opportunity not lost on the
record crowds visiting central Florida in these days of stock
windfalls and profligate spending.
</P>
<P>
   The newly accessorized Spaceship Earth is only the beginning of
the millennial festivities at Disney, actually. At Epcot, there is
also a Tapestry of Nations parade twice a day, an elaborate
fireworks display called IllumiNations 2000 every night, and a
Millennium Village of crafts, food stands and interactive exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   There is, too, a Leave a Legacy sculpture garden that invites
visitors to buy one-inch-square portraits of themselves, etched in
stainless steel, and have them attached to one of 35 granite
megaliths in front of Spaceship Earth. Reminding future generations
how you looked in a tank top at the turn of the century will cost
you $35.
</P>
<P>
   There is still more. At Pleasure Island, a grown-up complex of
dance clubs, shops and restaurants within an outdoor mall called
Downtown Disney, they're celebrating New Year's Eve every night. At
this so-called ``nightclub theme park,'' revelers nightly count
down to a midnight display of fireworks, a confetti storm and
musical entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   This is nothing new for Pleasure Island. They've been whooping
it up and counting it down every night since 1990; the turn of the
millennium has only upped the wattage. Furthermore, Disney's
official millennial celebration _ the wand, the fireworks, the
empanadas _ is not just early, but also plans to be late. It is to
continue at the resort through Jan. 1, 2001. Pleasure Island's
nightly parties should continue well past that.
</P>
<P>
   Is this good-natured (and lucrative) celebration overkill?
Disney doesn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are in a millennium mood early, and we think that will
be sustained,'' said Rick Sylvain, a Walt Disney World spokesman.
``We think it's an important reason to celebrate, and its good to
get a jump start on a new era. Our further feeling is that this is
too big for one night _ Dec. 31, 1999 _ so our shindig is 15 months
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Having just returned from Disney feeling World weary and able to
sum up my trip in one sentence _ ``Four theme parks and a luau in
four and a half days is too much'' _ I am convinced that the real
New Year's Eve will be anticlimactic for a lot of people. Not to
rain on anyone's Tapestry of Nations parade, but those who've been
enjoying themselves in 1999, an exciting year that has unjustly
been given short shrift, are likely to feel as if they've done New
Year's well before Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   If, for instance, you went to Bette Midler's stellar concerts on
Oct. 25 or 26 at Madison Square Garden, one of three New York area
stops on her ``Divine Miss Millennium'' tour, you've already seen
the show she'll do in Las Vegas on New Year's Eve. Ditto Cher's
over-the-top July 13 concert at the Garden. She'll be performing
the same show at Caesar's Palace in Atlantic City on Dec. 31. The
phrase ``been there, done that'' has never seemed more apropos.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, I went to my first millennium party, a
sushi-and-ice-cream bacchanal thrown by Comedy Central in the old
Barneys New York space in Manhattan. Decorated with stretched Lycra
sculptures, illuminated by the eerie glow of black light and
populated with female servers dressed as flight attendants on a
flying saucer, the party resembled, as noted by Jon Stewart, the
host of ``The Daily Show,'' the set of a science fiction porno
film.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks, there will likely be more such soirees,
as party-givers genially jump the gun. Personally, I've been ready
for New Year's Eve since the day I saw a preview screening of
``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.'' When the lights came up, I said
to my companion: ``Well, that's out of the way. Now, let's get this
millennium thing over with so we can get back to our lives.''
Others feel the same way, too.
</P>
<P>
   Adamo DiGregorio, the vice president for creative services at
Barneys, said last week that celebrating early is the way to go.
``If you're going to go to a millennium party, it had better be
now, because a lot of us are not going to be around on the 31st,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the minds behind the store's ``Blase About Y2K'' sale
going on last week, he plans to be far away from Times Square on
New Year's Eve. He may work for a hub of hip, but he doesn't want
to be anywhere near the epicenter of millennium mania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares about Y2K?'' he said. ``I don't, and I don't think
our customer does either. We were bored with the whole millennial
trip last spring. There are so many more interesting things to
think about than whether a bug is going to make the lights go out.
Buy candles. It'll be over soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Not at Walt Disney World.

   Asbestos from a now-closed vermiculite mine on a mountain near
Libby, Mont., has killed 192 people and left at least 375 people
with fatal diseases, a Seattle Post-Intelligencer investigation has
revealed. For the 30 years it owned the mine, the W.R. Grace
Company did not stop the tragedy, and neither did any government
agency. And doctors say the people of Libby will keep dying for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Intelligencer has prepared a special package of
stories, based on a review of thousands of documents and interviews
with more than 110 people. The stories, all by Andrew Schneider,
first moved Thursday, and are being repeated today for those who
need them. They are for use at will.

   ASBESTOS-DEATHS (Libby, Mont.) _ First, it killed some miners.
Then it killed wives and children, slipping into their homes on the
dusty clothing of hard-working men. Now the mine is closed, but in
Libby, the killing goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ASBESTOS-VERMICULITE (LIBBY, Mont.) _ Prospectors first put pick
and shovel to Zonolite Mountain 119 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ASBESTOS-GOVERNMENT (Libby, Mont.) _ They all say somebody
should do something. City, county, state and federal officials
agree that someone should follow up. Inquire. Ask questions about
the hundreds of people from Libby who have either died or been
diagnosed with fatal diseases after being exposed to tremolite
asbestos from a vermiculite mine. But every official and every
agency has a reason why, so far, they have not been that somebody.

LEVIN SAYS CONGRESS ACCOMPLISHED LITTLE THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first session of the 106th Congress was
``marked by excessive partisanship, posturing and paralysis,'' Sen.
Carl Levin, D-Mich. said Friday as Congress prepared to adjourn for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   The senator particularly lamented his colleagues' failure to
complete action on a patients-rights bill and gun-control
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said his office has received more phone calls on health
care and gun issues than on any other matter that Congress handled
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate did approve gun-control measures as part of a larger
bill on juvenile justice, but they were stripped out when the House
considered the bill. The juvenile justice bill, which would impose
stricter penalties on youthful offenders, is still awaiting action
by a panel of House and Senate negotiators. A key issue is whether
to include any gun-control provisions in the final package.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate-passed gun measures would raise the minimum age to
purchase a handgun from 18 to 21, require background checks on
people who buy weapons at gun shows and require safety locks on
guns.
</P>
<P>
   Levin accused the National Rifle Association of working to
ensure that the gun-control measures never become law.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Powers, an NRA spokesman, said Levin was ``criticizing
the wrong people.'' Powers said the NRA supports some of the
measures such as the gun-show provisions and safety locks.
</P>
<P>
   On the health front, Levin said he believes that next year
Congress will approve legislation giving people more rights in
dealing with their health insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be huge pressure to pass it,'' Levin said.
``The public genuinely wants this.'' He added that next year's
presidential and congressional elections ``will make it harder for
Republicans to vote against (health care) provisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin also predicted that legislation allowing Medicare, the
nation's health insurance program for the elderly, to cover
prescription drug costs will pass next year.
</P>
<P>
   While criticizing Congress' performance, Levin cited some
accomplishments _ a boost in Medicare payments to hospitals and
continued funding to hire 100,000 teachers.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed out several items that he was able to place in
spending bills this year that directly benefited Michigan
including:
</P>
<P>
   _$500,000 for an instrument landing system at the Harry Brown
Airport in Saginaw and $600,000 for a new air control tower at the
Pontiac Airport.
</P>
<P>
   _2.1 million to keep the Coast Guard's helicopter station in
Muskegon operating through next year.
</P>
<P>
   _$13 million to replace the Mackinaw icebreaker on the Great
Lakes and $100,000 for ice rescue equipment at the St. Clair Lake
Coast Guard Station.
</P>
<P>
   _$200,000 for sea-barrier construction at sites throughout the
Great Lakes basin.
</P>
<P>
   _$390,000 for upgrades of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration Great Lakes' water-level gauging stations.
</P>
<P>
   _$1 million for Army Corps of Engineers research on control of
zebra mussels, which adhere to water-intake pipes and damage them.

<P>
   It was Goethe's turn this year, the 250th since his birth, to be
caught in the lethal crossroads where politics and literature
intersect. A scholarly dispute has developed concerning the
correctness of his political behavior while a privy councilor in
Weimar in the 1770s. In Germany, the argument has tended to mirror
the old East-West division, since Goethe was all but canonized in
communist-ruled East Germany, whose leaders were for decades the
landlords of Weimar, the poet's adopted city.
</P>
<P>
   What adds interest is Johann Wolfgang Goethe's distinction as
one of the relatively few prominent writers to hold high office.
Among other men of letters (and they are all male) in this
exclusive club are the philosopher and essayist Francis Bacon, lord
chancellor to King James I; the poet John Milton, secretary to the
Council of State under Oliver Cromwell; the historian Alexis de
Tocqueville, foreign minister of France in the 1840s; the poet and
Academie Francaise member Leopold Senghor, president of Senegal
from independence through the 1970s; and the eminent Latin American
novelist Romulo Gallegos, president of Venezuela in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The results, it has to be said, have been mixed. Gallegos was
ousted in a military coup; Bacon was tried for bribery and stripped
of his office and its seals; Milton, having loyally defended
Cromwell's harsher deeds, including massacres in Ireland, was
arrested and fined after the Restoration, assuring him the enforced
leisure to complete ``Paradise Lost.''
</P>
<P>
   It would appear that Vaclav Havel, today's most conspicuous
entry on the list of literary leaders, , has also dimmed his glory
by lingering as president of the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Goethe became a court favorite in Weimar from the time he moved
from Frankfurt in 1775 at the invitation of Carl August, Duke of
Saxe-Weimar. There he served as administrator in the minuscule
duchy, whose capital, Weimar, comprised 6,000 souls when Goethe
arrived. But by the time he died in 1832, Weimar had become
synonymous with civility, enlightenment and the potential of human
genius.
</P>
<P>
   Yearlong festivities have been held in Weimar, designated
Europe's cultural capital for 1999. In America, the Goethe Year is
being widely observed with conferences and performances of his
plays.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Germany's revered national poet and emblem of humanistic
moderation is also being attacked as a human rights abuser. His
accuser is Dr. W. Daniel Wilson, chairman of the department of
German at the University of California at Berkeley. Based on
research in Weimar archives, Wilson maintains that Goethe, while
serving as a privy councilor, approved the sale of prisoners to
England to fight beside the Hessians against Colonial
revolutionaries. With Goethe's assent, says Wilson, a network of
informants spied on students suspected of subversive thought at the
University of Jena near Weimar, overriding faculty objections that
this was illegal and repugnant. Wilson's evidence is set forth in
``Das Goethe-Tabu'' (``The Goethe Taboo''), a 415-page book
published in Munich last spring that examines human rights in
classical Weimar.
</P>
<P>
   The response has been vehement. One critic, the eastern German
writer Peter Hacks, even proposed observing Goethe's birthday by
drowning Wilson in the Ilm, the river that runs through Weimar. By
contrast, commentary by western Germans has varied, from the
positive to the indignant, a measure of how differently Goethe was
viewed during four decades of German division.
</P>
<P>
   The communist authorities in East Germany liked to depict Goethe
as a precursor of the New Socialist Man, with his masterwork,
``Faust,'' serving as a kind of prologue to ``Das Kapital.'' In the
1950s the East German government installed a plaque on Goethe's
house asserting that ``Faust'' was meant ``to describe the life of
different classes and their struggles during the transition from
feudalism to capitalism. . . . It is a picture of the social and
ideological struggles of his time.''
</P>
<P>
   So obsessive was the Goethe cult in East Germany that in 1970
its scientists secretly exhumed the poet's body out of morbid
curiosity, measured it and carefully washed the laurel leaves on
its skull, reburying the remains in the dead of night _ an episode
finally reported this year by the western German daily Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wilson's case has been greeted skeptically in Britain and
America by scholars not prone to idealizing Goethe. The California
scholar is faulted for the sin of presentism _ that is,
retroactively applying today's standards to the past. At a recent
Yale conference on Goethe, Professor Jane Brown of the University
of Washington deplored the ``absurd amount of publicity'' given to
Wilson's assertion that Goethe's Weimar was ``repressive, paranoid
and anti-democratic.'' Peter Gay of Yale, an authority on the
Enlightenment and a biographer of Freud, remarked in conversation
that it was always known that Goethe was politically conservative,
notwithstanding East German attempts to claim him as an embryonic
Marxist.
</P>
<P>
   Also unpersuaded is Dr. Nicholas Boyle, the British scholar now
completing the third volume of what may be this generation's
definitive Goethe biography. As Boyle noted in the first volume,
``Goethe: The Poet and the Age'' (Oxford University Press, 1991),
more may well be known about the author than about almost any other
human being. His works and letters fill 143 volumes of the great
Weimar edition (1887-1919), since amplified by supplementary works,
and even his casual bon mots were preserved by worshipful friends.
Given this landfill of documents, Boyle found the human rights
indictment grossly overblown, based on press accounts he had read.
He could see little that was unusual or inappropriate about the
actions Goethe is said to have taken, and found it ``ludicrous''
that one article referred to the other great German romantic poet,
Friedrich Schiller, as a mole spying for Goethe.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To which Wilson retorts, ``Let them read my book before judging
it based on press accounts.'' His information is new and derives
from Weimar's official archives, which for years were all but
inaccessible to Western scholars. He maintains that Goethe
initialed state documents that violated contemporary legal
principles, for example, punishing peasants who protested against
the government's violation of their rights; Weimar's own judiciary
objected strenuously to these infringements.
</P>
<P>
   Goethe is also said to have approved subjecting petty thieves
and jailed vagabonds to a potential death penalty by forcing them
to fight for the British in the American colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson acknowledges that one cannot know what Goethe said or
thought when these measures were approved, but his assent in the
records makes his responsibility for these decisions
``undeniable.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the prevailing conservatism, Wilson adds, these events
occurred before the French Revolution and the panic it provoked
among the German states. The spying on students not only offended
customs, Wilson maintains, but involved reliance on anonymous
accusers, contrary to legal practices of the time, as professors at
Jena are said to have protested.
</P>
<P>
   It may strike a lay reader that the political vagaries of great
poets are hardly an unfamiliar phenomenon. According to a new
biography, ``The Hidden Wordsworth: Poet, Lover, Rebel, Spy'' by
Kenneth R. Johnston of Indiana University, Goethe _ an early
admirer of the French Revolution (``Bliss was it in that dawn to be
alive/But to be young was very Heaven!'') _ later undertook spying
missions in Germany for a newly formed British secret service. It
has long been maintained that the playwright Christopher Marlowe
was on the payroll of Sir Francis Walsingham, spymaster for Queen
Elizabeth I, when Marlowe was killed in a tavern brawl in 1593.
</P>
<P>
   In Goethe's case, an unintended effect of Wilson's charges is to
make a remote and lofty figure more interesting. Years ago, Sir Max
Beerbohm voiced a common complaint that however great, Goethe was
simply too perfect. ``He was never injudicious,'' Beerbohm wrote,
``never lazy, always in his best form and always in love with some
lady or another just so much as was good for the development of his
soul and art, but never more than that by a tittle.'' Now the
author of ``The Sorrows of Young Werther'' has been brought closer
to the political confusions of our own troubled time; the plaster
bust is yet one more target for humanizing spitballs.

 &HT;    The secret behind Mr. Popularity
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sorry to ruin the surprise, but Bill Elliott will win
the Winston Cup Most Popular Driver award again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott will pick up his trophy at the NASCAR Awards Banquet
next month in New York, just as he has 13 times in the past 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   He is a lock to accept the sculpture of a race driver signing
autographs for fans for the ninth consecutive year: As of Monday,
Elliott had 59 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   It's another victorious campaign for the Bill Elliott Fan Club,
which still believes he's Awesome Bill even though he hasn't won a
race in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the NMPA, the National Motorsports Press
Association, which sponsors the popularity contest, is chagrined.
Three times it has changed the way fans can vote to stop the
Elliott steamroller, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a concentrated effort by Elliott's fans to get the
job done, and you've got to give them credit,'' said Steve Waid,
the outgoing president of the NMPA. ``It's like a huge, political
machine, and they know exactly what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's continuing popularity, despite a declining career, has
been a curiosity that some deep-thinking sports psychologists have
pondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill's always smiling; he seems friendly,'' said Dr. James
Millhouse, a sports psychologist in Atlanta. ``Like a guy you'd sit
down and have a cup of coffee with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Elliott was a big winner, and people in NASCAR are a
little bit different fans,'' said Jack Llewellyn, the sports
psychologist who works with the Atlanta Braves baseball
organization. ``People in NASCAR are very, very loyal,'' Llewellyn
said. ``If you win in NASCAR and go on for 20 years and don't win
again, you're still a champion. People in other sports are loyal if
you win this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Elliott is stumped about the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total shock that the awards keep coming,'' Elliott
said. ``The fans have been extremely loyal. I came from nothing,
and I think people relate to that.''
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't take a psychologist to recognize a great job of
ballot-box stuffing. Elliott wins the awards because his fan club
demands it. His club has been the most aggressive in getting out
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   At his hauler, beside the photo-cards for fans to take, are
stickers with ``Vote For Bill'' and the 1-900 number used in the
voting. Club members pass out the stickers whenever Elliott makes
an appearance at McDonald's, his sponsor. The number is on his Web
site. They've taken out ads in the Dawsonville, Ga., paper. ``I've
seen them handing out fliers,'' Waid said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill Elliott Fan Club has about 20,000 members. ``They're
allowed to make 25 phone calls to the 900 polling number from a
single phone line,'' club President Dixie Price said. ``It adds
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Price said she never has been instructed to make the award a
priority. ``We've just always worked for it,'' she said. ``The fans
start calling in about April or May wanting to know when the voting
starts and if I have the number. Of course, I do.''
</P>
<P>
   She chuckles at the suggestion that Elliott fans stuff the
ballot box. ``He does have a lot of fans. I wish I had the power he
has.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a precedent for their resolve. Darrell Waltrip won the
award in 1989 and 1990 when his sponsor, Proctor &AMP; Gamble, put
ballots in employee paychecks at the Tide factory.
</P>
<P>
   That was when ballots could be photo-copied and mailed to R.J.
Reynolds. ``It got to the point you'd see one person obviously
voting several times,'' Waid said.
</P>
<P>
   So the polling was changed to require an original ballot
available only in NASCAR Winston Cup Scene magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``That severely limited the votes,'' Waid said. ``One year there
were only 2,000 votes nationwide. Elliott's troops nonetheless
found every way in the world to get around this thing. One member
of the fan club _ I assume he was or is a huge Elliott fan _ came
to our offices at Winston Cup Scene and bought 200 to 300 papers to
take back and have people vote using the original ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, the NMPA went to the telephone system,
which costs 79 cents per call, with money going to maintain the
NMPA Hall of Fame at the Joe Weatherly Stock Car Museum at
Darlington Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most fans obviously pick up a phone and call once or twice for
their 79 cents,'' Waid said. ``But the Elliott fans don't think
anything about making 25 calls from their phone, then go to the
neighbor's phone, pay them for 25 calls or send them money to call.
There have been guys stationed overseas who've sent money back to
Elliott's fan club and said, 'Use this money to vote for Bill.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Price said that Elliott fans are all over the world, wherever
there's a satellite feed that picks up a race. ``The Canadian fans
are real upset, because they can't dial the 900 number to vote,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing that has been done has changed the zeal of the Elliott
fans to get him elected Most Popular Driver,'' Waid said.
</P>
<P>
   Waid has talked with the Dale Earnhardt fan club _ Earnhardt
always finishes second _ about studying the Elliott Club's
approach. The NMPA would like to see someone else besides Elliott
win the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``The down side of all this is fans of other drivers are so used
to seeing Bill win it, they don't vote,''Waid said. ``They feel
like they're wasting their money.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has seen the impact of a dedicated campaign. Last year, a
Milwaukee radio station urged fans to vote for Milwaukee native
Dick Trickle, who hasn't won a Winston Cup race since he started
driving the circuit in 1970. Trickle finished fifth in the voting.
</P>
<P>
   At least, Elliott knows where he has to be the first weekend of
every December.
</P>
<P>
   ``He travels all the way to New York for that one thing, for
five minutes on stage. He gets that award, and then he's gone,''
Waid said. ``But he's really awed and appreciative of it, and he
makes sure that his fans
</P>
<P>
   know about it.''

 &HT;    Winston Cup's lame-duck drivers hope
 &HT;    to wind up season with a strong finish
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Johnny Benson and Wally Dallenbach are having a
farewell tour at Atlanta Motor Speedway on Sunday. But they aren't
retiring from Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The two veterans are driving the last time for their respective
race teams before moving to different organizations. Lame-duck
drivers Ricky Rudd, Ken Schrader, Kenny Irwin and Joe Nemechek are
in similar situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to go out would be to win the race,'' Benson
said. ``But we need to at least go down there and have a good run.
Inconsistency is the one thing that has hurt us this year. We've
had some good runs, but mainly some bad runs. I think everyone
wants to have a good run in Atlanta. I'd like to at least beat our
best finish of the year. That's my goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson was one of the most promising drivers on the circuit two
years ago and signed a lucrative contract with Roush Racing. But he
never thought the partnership would end this soon. Benson bought
his way out of the last two years of his Roush contract earlier
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to Roush in '97, I was planning on it working out,
with me staying there for the rest of my racing career,'' Benson
said. ``But it just didn't happen that way. It started off really
good with Roush. Then some changes were made that I felt weren't
for the best. We weren't improving, and we were going the other
way. It was time for me to make a decision to do things
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson, who is 27th in Winston Cup points standings, is the only
lame-duck driver without a ride for the 2000 season. He said he is
talking to two Winston Cup teams, which he declined to identify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, wherever I go, I should definitely have a better
season that I've had this year,'' Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dallenbach was stunned when Hendrick Motorsports decided not to
renew his contract for the 2000 season. Hendrick, who owns the race
teams of Jeff Gordon and Terry Labonte, is one of the top
motorsports organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, it was a slap in the face. . . . I felt like
Hendrick sold out,'' Dallenbach said. ``Then I started looking at
it, and business is business. If I had a better offer, I'd probably
have done the same thing.''

 By RICK MARIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Peter Jennings has grilled presidents, foreign heads
of state and terrorists. But he had his work cut out for him with
Cindy Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   This improbable pair sat on a makeshift stage inside the Puck
Building on the morning of Nov. 13. They were the marquee
attractions for participants in Artwalk NY, an annual charity event
organized by the Coalition for the Homeless. One of Jennings'
duties as the event's chairman for the last five years has been
interviewing the likes of Ms. Sherman, the
photographer-provocateuse. For one day a year, this uptown
anchorman gets to play aesthete, pretend he's the Bohemian
correspondent for ABC News, and mingle in East Village basements
and Bowery garrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first part of my notebook says, `Kashmir, Pakistan,
Jerusalem,' then `Cindy Sherman,''' Jennings said, flipping through
the pad on his knee. ``Proof that I'm privileged, if not always
capable, of accepting a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sherman _ her face frozen in an awkwardly polite smile that
suggested one of her unsettling self-portraits _ wrestled gamely
with questions like ``What exacerbates you that we may or may not
see in your art?''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to himself as a ``middle-aged man,'' Jennings, 61,
played the role of slightly square interlocutor. But he did it in a
way that anyone listening would know he knows more about
contemporary art than he lets on.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was fun, eh?'' he said afterward, reverting to his
Canadian roots with a boyish exuberance that might surprise anyone
used to his cool delivery of ``World News Tonight.'' He had donned
olive cords, a checked shirt with the top two buttons rakishly open
and wire-rimmed glasses for the trip downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Saturday morning question and answer session,
Artwalk gives contributors to the homeless coalition a chance to
spend the afternoon touring artists' studios. For Jennings and his
wife, Kayce Freed, it's an Artdrive. Heading down Lafayette Street
in an ABC-supplied Town Car, Jennings checks in with his office for
updates on the Egypt-Air crash and whether Madonna, the chairwoman
of an Artwalk gala that night, planned to honor her commitment to
present Ms. Sherman with an award. He had sent flowers to welcome
Madonna back from London, with a note saying that he looked forward
to seeing her. But Madonna's people told his people that he should
stop pressuring her, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Shapiro, the sculptor, was already lecturing a group of
Artwalkers when Jennings arrived at the studio on Bleecker Street.
A critic had praised the ``Poussin-ian movement'' in his work,
Shapiro said. Jennings chewed on his glasses and asked more of his
arty questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You used the word `struggle.' What do you mean?'' and ``Does
the space help define what you do?''
</P>
<P>
   When Shapiro said he cast his bronzes in Beacon, N.Y., Jennings
commented: ``Oh, sure. Wonderful foundry.'' He was also familiar
with Shapiro's 30-foot-tall sculpture in front of the new U.S.
Embassy in Ottawa, where Jennings grew up and still keeps an
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's right outside my bedroom window,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings thanked the sculptor on behalf of the coalition for
opening up his studio, then worked the crowd gregariously on his
way out the door.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was more subdued at Martha Diamond's modest
second-story garret on the Bowery. Two or three visitors examined
some swirly, fuzzy cityscapes propped against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll ask the rude question,'' Jennings said to Ms. Diamond.
``Are they finished?''
</P>
<P>
   They were.
</P>
<P>
   He got down on his knees to examine one of the small oil
studies, while Ms. Freed said that their own art collection
consists mainly of a watercolor by the Canadian artist Emily Carr
and several Inuit carvings.
</P>
<P>
   Descending the long staircase and ducking back into his car,
Jennings emphasized that, on the scholarly-critical front, he is no
Clement Greenberg. His primary interest in Artwalk is the homeless,
he insisted, not the art, though he clearly enjoys hanging out in
this hipster milieu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know much about art,'' he said. ``But I know that
being in a place with art can transform you.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the anchorman squeezed his broad 6-foot-1 frame into the
cramped East Village basement studio of Matt Baumgardner, a man
reading aloud from his own treatise on the painter's stark plastery
canvases looked up and said, ``You're never late with the news!''
</P>
<P>
   The man, Tony De Lorenzo, a writer friend of the artist, read
and read and read, while Gregorian chants played over the sound
system. Jennings surreptitiously asked to be handed a reporter's
notebook and inscribed the word ``Whew!''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the treatise ended. Baumgardner _ an East Village
painter from central casting, black-clad with a vertical thatch of
bottle-blond Jim Jarmusch hair _ invited everyone up into his
house. There, Jennings examined more stark plastery paintings.
</P>
<P>
   One stop left: Damian Loeb on Lispenard Street in TriBeCa.
Loeb's paintings are hyper-realistic reproductions of photographs
with some jarring detail added by him. Striking nudity, or perhaps
a dead dog. Roxy Music played on his expensive-looking stereo
(McIntosh components) as he told of life before Mary Boone: living
in New York without running water after dropping out of high school
in Greenwich, Conn. To which Jennings exclaimed, ``Welcome to the
club!'' A bonding moment between two successful dropouts.
</P>
<P>
   Darkness was falling, and SoHo was a parking lot of weekend
gridlock. After three light changes and no movement, Jennings leapt
from the car and strode into the intersection of Green and Spring
Streets, where he started directing traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Peter, next time you touch my car, I'm gonna . . . '' one
motorist shouted, threatening violence.
</P>
<P>
   The cars started moving again. By 7 p.m., Jennings was back at
the Puck Building, having changed into a suit and Hermes tie,
presenting Ms. Sherman with her award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of you came here tonight expecting to see
Madonna,'' he said. ``And so did we.''
</P>
<P>
   His arm around Ms. Sherman, he covered for this awkward
situation with a joke: ``I hug Cindy, Cindy hugs me and we both
think it's bad for our reputations.''
</P>
<P>
   After introducing Christopher Burge, the chairman of Christie's
in America and the evening's auctioneer, Jennings assumed the role
of 800-pound assistant, carrying the pictures around the room so
everyone could get a look and cajoling bidders. When Joe Zee, the
fashion director at W magazine, appeared unwilling to go from $900
to $1,000 for a photograph, Jennings pulled a $100 bill from his
pocket and handed it to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's a round number,'' he said. ``Come on!''
</P>
<P>
   More than once, Jennings threw out bids of his own, or nudged
his wife to, keeping the high rollers (J. Crew's founder, Emily
Woods; the designer Kenzo) rolling even higher. He himself bought a
Jenny Holzer for $6,000 and donated it to the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   When the auction was done, he took the group's executive
director, Mary Brosnahan, under his arm and told her, with a
conspiratorial wink, ``You know, you could probably sell it and
make some money on the deal.''

   The holidays are upon us, which means you'll soon be facing
mobbed shopping centers, hordes of noisy relatives and a glut of
meaningless college football games.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling a sudden urge to wall yourself off from the insanity?
</P>
<P>
   Then join ranks with the wretched-but-noble barricade builders
of !bold!  &UR; ``Les Miserables,'' &LR; !off! &UR;  &LR; the stirring musical
adaptation of Victor Hugo's classic novel by Alain Boubilil and
Claude-Michel Schonberg. The touring production of the
international mega-hit, which arrives Dec. 12 at the Ahmanson
Theatre, promises to be the most lavish version L.A. has seen in
years.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer a less tempestuous cup of seasonal cheer, then
drink in Theatre West's new musical version of !bold! &UR; ``A Christmas
Carol'' &LR;  !off!(Nov. 24-Jan. 9). Entertainer/composer/Renaissance
man Steve Allen supplies the songs for Tiny Tim and company.
</P>
<P>
   Songs aren't included in A Noise Within's production of
!bold! &UR; ``A Christmas Carol,'' &LR; !off! which runs Dec. 10-19 at Cal
State L.A.'s Luckman Fine Arts Complex, but the acting in this
company is typically so good it may send you out the door humming
the dialogue.

   Traditionalists for whom December isn't complete without
!bold! &UR; ``The Nutcracker'' &LR; !off! &UR;  &LR; can get their annual Tchaikovsky
fix Dec. 4 and 5. The beloved ballet will be performed by Festival
Ballet Theater with the University Symphony Orchestra at the

   If you dream of spending the holidays overseas, you can visit
Paris without ever leaving the Mark Taper Forum. That's where Neil
Simon's !bold! &UR; ``The Dinner Party'' &LR;  !off!is having its world
premiere Dec. 2-Jan. 16. Everyone's being tight-lipped about the
plot, but the ensemble cast includes Frances Conroy, Veanne Cox,
Edward Herrmann, John Ritter, Rita Wilson and Henry Winkler. And
here's a twist: All six play French characters _ which tells you
the play has something to do with food and sex.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Nov. 21, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA-REVIEW (Moscow) _ Russia's brutal effort to
subdue runaway Chechnya is messily wiping out civilians and
soldiers alike, drawing world protest _ and, by Russian estimation,
working quite well, thank you. Americans cannot truly imagine
Russians' frustration at their imperial disintegration and economic
collapse. But perhaps they can get a sense of the emotional release
that Chechnya evokes among Russians by recalling how good it felt,
after two decades of Vietnam, Watergate, Iran and Lebanon, to
finally regain their military prowess by striking back first at
Libyan terrorism in 1986 and then, far more dramatically, against
Saddam Hussein in Kuwait in 1991. By Michael Wines. (Moving in the
`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   POLLING-RELIABILITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Most politicians'
vigilant reliance on poll numbers raises an important but
seldom-asked public policy question: Who actually talks to
pollsters and who does not? The answer, it turns out, is troubling
news for the polling industry and the people who rely on the
numbers: Far fewer people agree to participate in surveys than just
10 years ago, a fact that some critics call the industry's dirty
little secret, because most polling firms refuse to divulge their
surveys' refusal rates. By Don Van Natta. (Moving in the `a'
category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   JUVENILE-JUSTICE-REVIEW (Pontiac, Mich.) _ Many psychologists
and sociologists nowadays worry that boys are growing up too fast
these days. Boys are increasingly dressing like adults, watching
television shows for adults and having sex. The answer, the child
development experts say, lies in letting boys stay young longer,
through more parental guidance and supervision, more mentoring and,
for disturbed boys, more counseling before emotional problems lead
to potentially lethal violence. Yet the nation's juvenile justice
system is rapidly moving in the opposite direction, with ever more
boys being tried as adults. By Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-DIET-REVIEW (Undated) _ If it tastes good, eat it! Paul
Rozin, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania, offers a
new explanation for why the French eat a diet richer than that of
Americans yet suffer fewer health consequences. Where other
researchers have offered reasons ranging from genetic differences
to red wine consumption, Rozin suggests that it may all come down
to one's state of mind. By Eric Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS-GROUPS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Every major presidential
candidate is spending money to assemble focus groups to glean
intelligence on everything from fashion to policy. Their reliance
on these groups underscores the degree to which politicians _ in
trying to capture the attention of an often distracted public _
find themselves worrying as much about presentation as about
substance. While many campaigns say the groups give them tips that
cannot be found in sterile poll numbers, critics say the findings
are hardly representative of the electorate. By Richard L. Berke
</P>
<P>
   UNEMPLOYMENT-REVIEW (Washington) _ The big questions now about
unemployment are how low it can go, and whether the low rate can be
sustained over the long run as the economy and the population
change. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan feels the jobless rate should
not go much lower, or else there could be inflationary pressures as
employers are forced to raise prices after bidding up pay for
scarce workers. But there is considerable uncertainty among other
economists about how low unemployment can go before the risks
outweigh the benefits. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   DOCTORS-TRAINING-REVIEW (Undated) _ How long does it take to
make a doctor? Book-smart youngsters with new diplomas slink out of
medical school knowing that they are impostors. A few years later
they discover they have turned into doctors. And, for all the
tinkering with those years by generations of medical educators, the
alchemy of the transformation and how long it should take remain
almost as mysterious as ever. A look at some problems in medical
training and efforts to resolve them. By Abigail Zuger.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-SURVIVAL-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Help for big-time Y2K
worriers: self-reliance publications dedicated to smoothing the way
to apocalypse now. They include periodicals like American Survival
Guide and Backwoods Home, which offer tips on what to do when all
hell breaks loose on Jan. 1 _ not to mention a chance to win a one
year supply of dehydrated foodstuffs! A collection of colorful
excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-U.S.-POLITICS-REVIEW (Florence, Italy) _ Under President
Clinton, America has had achievements of which Europe's
anti-American leftists can only dream: a budget surplus, nearly 19
million new jobs, sustained growth, full employment and welfare
rolls at a 30-year low. Clinton says it's the result of a `third
way' involving fiscal responsibility and government activisim. At a
meeting convened here to ponder 21st-century `progressive
governance, ' Clinton is certain to find that center-left
camaraderie and identity of view do not necessarily stretch across
the Atlantic. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TRADE-REVIEW (Beijing) _ After months of speculation that
conservative, protectionist forces were gaining the upper hand,
China made sweeping commitments to slash barriers to trade and
foreign investment and to accept international rules. The deal
showed that President Jiang Zemin and most of the other Communist
Party leaders believe that radical change is the only hope if China
is to attain long-term prosperity and greatness. Since these men
are also politicians, they are most likely making this risky leap
in the belief that it is the only way to save the party's monopoly
on power. By Erik Eckholm.

pollsters and who does not? The answer, it turns out, is troubling
news for the polling industry and the people who rely on the
numbers: Far fewer people agree to participate in surveys than just
10 years ago, a fact that some critics call the industry's dirty
little secret, because most polling firms refuse to divulge their
surveys' refusal rates. By Don Van Natta. (Moving in the `a'

   JUVENILE-JUSTICE-REVIEW (Pontiac, Mich.) _ Many psychologists
and sociologists nowadays worry that boys are growing up too fast
these days. Boys are increasingly dressing like adults, watching
television shows for adults and having sex. The answer, the child
development experts say, lies in letting boys stay young longer,
through more parental guidance and supervision, more mentoring and,
for disturbed boys, more counseling before emotional problems lead
to potentially lethal violence. Yet the nation's juvenile justice
system is rapidly moving in the opposite direction, with ever more
boys being tried as adults. By Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-DIET-REVIEW (Undated) _ If it tastes good, eat it! Paul
Rozin, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania, offers a
new explanation for why the French eat a diet richer than that of
Americans yet suffer fewer health consequences. Where other
researchers have offered reasons ranging from genetic differences
to red wine consumption, Rozin suggests that it may all come down
to one's state of mind. By Eric Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS-GROUPS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Every major presidential
candidate is spending money to assemble focus groups to glean
intelligence on everything from fashion to policy. Their reliance
on these groups underscores the degree to which politicians _ in
trying to capture the attention of an often distracted public _
find themselves worrying as much about presentation as about
substance. While many campaigns say the groups give them tips that
cannot be found in sterile poll numbers, critics say the findings
are hardly representative of the electorate. By Richard L. Berke
</P>
<P>
   UNEMPLOYMENT-REVIEW (Washington) _ The big questions now about
unemployment are how low it can go, and whether the low rate can be
sustained over the long run as the economy and the population
change. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan feels the jobless rate should
not go much lower, or else there could be inflationary pressures as
employers are forced to raise prices after bidding up pay for
scarce workers. But there is considerable uncertainty among other
economists about how low unemployment can go before the risks
outweigh the benefits. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   DOCTORS-TRAINING-REVIEW (Undated) _ How long does it take to
make a doctor? Book-smart youngsters with new diplomas slink out of
medical school knowing that they are impostors. A few years later
they discover they have turned into doctors. And, for all the
tinkering with those years by generations of medical educators, the
alchemy of the transformation and how long it should take remain
almost as mysterious as ever. A look at some problems in medical
training and efforts to resolve them. By Abigail Zuger.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-SURVIVAL-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Help for big-time Y2K
worriers: self-reliance publications dedicated to smoothing the way
to apocalypse now. They include periodicals like American Survival
Guide and Backwoods Home, which offer tips on what to do when all
hell breaks loose on Jan. 1 _ not to mention a chance to win a one
year supply of dehydrated foodstuffs! A collection of colorful
excerpts.

   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.

</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-U.S.-POLITICS-REVIEW (Florence, Italy) _ Under President
Clinton, America has had achievements of which Europe's
anti-American leftists can only dream: a budget surplus, nearly 19
million new jobs, sustained growth, full employment and welfare
rolls at a 30-year low. Clinton says it's the result of a `third
way' involving fiscal responsibility and government activisim. At a
meeting convened here to ponder 21st-century `progressive
governance, ' Clinton is certain to find that center-left
camaraderie and identity of view do not necessarily stretch across
the Atlantic. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TRADE-REVIEW (Beijing) _ After months of speculation that
conservative, protectionist forces were gaining the upper hand,
China made sweeping commitments to slash barriers to trade and
foreign investment and to accept international rules. The deal
showed that President Jiang Zemin and most of the other Communist
Party leaders believe that radical change is the only hope if China
is to attain long-term prosperity and greatness. Since these men
are also politicians, they are most likely making this risky leap
in the belief that it is the only way to save the party's monopoly
on power. By Erik Eckholm.

<P>
   New Year's Eve is the big one _ especially this year.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the rock, pop and jazz clubs, and concert halls are
bringing out the heavy artillery. What else can you say about a
night that sees the  &UR; Eagles &LR;  competing with  &UR; Red Hot Chili
Peppers, &LR;   &UR; Jimmy Buffett, Al Green  &LR; and  &UR; Brian Wilson &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   But before we even get to that much-anticipated evening, there's
plenty going on in town as an appetizer.
</P>
<P>
   In the clubs,  &UR; Stereolab &LR;  brings its strange retro sound to the
Troubadour tonight, while  &UR; Marcy Playground  &LR; (``Sex and Candy'')
and the acclaimed  &UR; Blinker the Star &LR;  come to the same venue
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chart-topping rap-rocker  &UR; Kid Rock &LR;  brings his high-energy stage
show to the Hollywood Palladium on Saturday and Nov. 28, but,
sadly, diminutive sidekick Joe C has to sit this one out due to
medical problems. Rob Zombie's younger brother's band,  &UR; Powerman
5000 &LR; , opens.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 2, fun-loving rockers  &UR; Primus &LR;  and Calabasas' own
 &UR; Incubus &LR;  come to the Palladium, while ex-Smiths' mope-rocker
 &UR; Morrissey &LR;  weeps into a flowered hanky Dec. 15 and 16.
</P>
<P>
   Another music-biz veteran, ex-Soundgarden frontman  &UR; Chris
Cornell &LR; , continues his solo tour with dates at the Wiltern Theatre
on Dec. 2 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   This is also the season for benefit shows _ and what better bill
than  &UR; Emmylou Harris, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Steve Earle, Nanci
Griffith  &LR; and  &UR; Guy Clark &LR;  on Dec. 3 at El Camino College Center for
the Arts. The unplugged acoustic show will benefit a campaign to
address the damage caused by anti-personnel land mines.
</P>
<P>
   Old hands the  &UR; Counting Crows &LR;  have an odd series of dates at
the Wiltern Theatre _ Dec. 6, 9, 10, 20 and 21 _ in support of
their new album, ``This Desert Life.'
</P>
<P>
   And for reggae fans, sweet-voiced crooner  &UR; Gregory Isaacs &LR;  hits
the Ventura Theatre on Dec. 10. Expect to hear his classic jam,
``Night Nurse.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern-rock radio KROQ's Almost Acoustic Christmas is always an
event, and this year the lineup featuring  &UR; Foo Fighters, Bush, 311,
Save Ferris  &LR; and  &UR; Blink-182 &LR;  is moving to Anaheim Pond on Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   On the same date, urban radio KKBT hosts its Beat Holiday
Cooldown show with  &UR; D'Angelo  &LR; and  &UR; Ideal &LR;  at the Wiltern
Theatre. &UR;  &LR; Hip-hop/soul diva  &UR; Mary J. Blige &LR;  acts as mistress of
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest shows of the season are two hot dates with
 &UR; Rage Against the Machine &LR;  at the Forum on Dec. 19 and 20. The
politically inclined quartet struck gold this year with a new
album, ``The Battle of Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also much to choose from on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the high-flying Eagles date with  &UR; Jackson Browne &LR;  and
 &UR; Linda Ronstadt &LR;  at the Staples Center, there's the Red Hot Chili
Peppers with 311 at the Forum; Buffett and his Parrotheads at the
Universal Amphitheatre;  &UR; Chaka Khan, Berlin &LR;  and  &UR; Missing Persons
 &LR; at &UR;  &LR; Universal Studios Hollywood's Millennium Dance Party; soul man
Green at the House of Blues; Beach Boys founder Wilson at the
Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center; and blues man  &UR; Guitar Shorty &LR; 
at B.B. King's Blues Club.
</P>
<P>
   For jazz aficionados, too, New Year's will be a night to
remember.
</P>
<P>
   Latin-jazz band leader  &UR; Poncho &LR;   &UR; Sanchez &LR; , for example, will be
sizzling at the Conga Room. Also, the great pianist  &UR; Hank Jones
 &LR; will jam with lively Coltrane-esque saxophonist  &UR; Kenny Garrett &LR;  at
Catalina Bar &AMP; Grill.
</P>
<P>
   And the funky jazz of the  &UR; Jimmy McGriff-Hank Crawford Quartet
 &LR; gets a boost from lyrical vocalist  &UR; Jimmy Scott &LR;  at the Jazz
Bakery.
</P>
<P>
   Hot dates &QL; 
Tickets are available through TicketMaster locations, which you'll
find at all Wherehouse, Tower Records, Ritmo Latino and
Robinsons-May outlets, unless otherwise stated. To charge by phone,

 &HT;    Scripture-spouting zealots lose grip on Texas Baptists
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Baptists in Texas displayed a rare
combination of wisdom and courage last week.
</P>
<P>
   They read Scripture honestly and were brave enough to make a
radical decision based on that reading.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Baptist Convention meeting this week in Orlando
apparently ducked the opportunity to do either.
</P>
<P>
   Messengers at the Texas General Convention, the largest state
meeting in the Southern Baptist world, repudiated their national
convention's outrageous claim that wives must submit graciously to
their husband's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Convention didn't even discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   The national convention believes that God made first-century
social customs eternal. The Bible, written nearly 2,000 years ago,
is, they claim, a God-given blueprint for social custom today.
Wives submit in the Bible. They must submit today.
</P>
<P>
   Conveniently, the male-dominated denomination, which does not
ordain women, found in Scripture a hierarchy of male superiority
that preserves the status quo _ and their prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   The courageous decision by Texas Baptists to break with national
leadership is a sign, however modest, that some Christians do not
misuse the Bible to bolster their own opinions. Many do.
</P>
<P>
   Christian groups of all stripes have long used the Bible both to
condemn those who are different and enlist God as a divine _ and,
therefore, indisputable _ advocate for their own causes. The list
of biblical abuse is legion.
</P>
<P>
   The temperance movement quoted the Bible relentlessly and
erroneously to campaign against demon rum and, ultimately, bring
about Prohibition earlier in this century. This despite the fact
that Scripture extols the virtues of the fermented grape. Jesus
made as much as 140 gallons of the delightful potion at Cana. He
drank wine on the night he was betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Christians have long used the Bible to justify persecuting Jews.
Christian slave owners insisted that holy writ blessed their
heinous practice. Later, Christian folk claimed segregation was an
honored biblical principle.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Peter Gomes, preacher to Harvard University, wrote that
people often use the Bible ``as a moral fig leaf to cover their
naked prejudice.'' His study of the Bible (``The Good Book,''
William Morrow, New York, 1996) is a fresh and welcome antidote to
those who too often honor the letter but do violence to the spirit
of Scripture.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, women have been kept in a second-class place by
those quoting chapter and verse of Scripture. And, lately, the
Bible is used as a weapon to condemn homosexuals with little regard
to the Scriptural context that mentions them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in 1996, the Southern Baptist Convention apologized for
its role in once supporting slavery. And now, Texas Baptists object
to the biblical abuse of women.
</P>
<P>
   A difficult struggle remains to help the faithful refrain from
using the Bible as divine validation of their prejudices. But the
Baptists of Texas give us hope.

FOR NOW, ANANDA LEWIS IS THE `I' IN VIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 21)  
(lh) 
 By DOUGLAS CENTURY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I'm not a VJ tonight _ I'm the DJ,'' Ananda Lewis
said one recent night at Joe's Pub. Ms. Lewis, who spends her
workdays introducing videos as the host of ``Hot Zone,'' a weekday
MTV show, stood bopping behind the microphone in cuffed jeans, a
halter top and a feathered headband.
</P>
<P>
   She sipped a glass of merlot, selecting an eclectic mix of CDs
ranging from Alanis Morisette to Dinah Washington to Culture Club.
```Karma Chameleon?''' one partygoer asked skeptically. True, her
selections were not representative of the latest hip-hop beat that
many in the crowd wanted to hear, but Ms. Lewis wasn't concerned.
``I don't care if you like my taste in music or not _ it's my party
tonight,'' she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The night had been planned as an intimate gathering for a
handful of Ms. Lewis' friends and colleagues, but by 10 p.m., Joe's
Pub was swarming with celebrities like Jay-Z, Star Jones, Tyson
Beckford and Savion Glover. At a table next to the stage sat the
artist formerly known as Prince, who had dropped by unexpectedly;
he even reached up and handed Ms. Lewis a CD of an unreleased track
to play for the shimmying crowd.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't recognize the name Ananda Lewis, it may be because
you're older than 23, or not a hip-hop star, or not a regular
supplicant in the land of the velvet ropes. In the last year, Ms.
Lewis has emerged as the hip-hop generation's reigning It Girl,
meaning she is not just an MTV personality but a woman whose looks
and attitude have made her perpetually in demand at clubs and
parties. She is neither singer nor actress, yet from SoHo to South
Beach she consorts with stars like Q-Tip, Maxwell, Shaquille O'Neal
and Lenny Kravitz. Russell Simmons, no slouch in the night-life
department, calls her a ``socialite extraordinaire.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Elam, Ms. Lewis' best friend since freshman year at
Howard University and now a financial editor in New York, said,
``Everywhere Ananda goes, there's always a ton of people who want
to be around the party.'' As if to prove it, Doug E. Fresh, the
old-school rapper, stepped up to the microphone at Joe's Pub and
said, ``I heard about this party, and I came all the way across
town because I love this woman so much!''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Is Ms. Lewis the second coming of Downtown Julie Brown (the MTV
VJ famous a few years back for little more than being in the right
club at the right time)? Certainly, the surface package is part of
her allure: She has long wavy tresses and a delicate oval face that
sometimes cause her to be mistaken for Chilli, the stunner from
TLC. And there is the access she offers stars to the youth market,
helping them plug their latest CDs and movies in interviews on MTV.
But Ms. Lewis' popularity with the black entertainment aristocracy
goes deeper. Though only 25, she is well remembered from her
pre-MTV career as the host of ``Teen Summit'' on Black
Entertainment Television, a youth-issues show she used to raise
awareness of teen-age pregnancy and illiteracy. After the shootings
in Columbine, Colo., she moderated MTV forums on school violence in
Denver and Los Angeles, and she was the host of an MTV news
special, ``Driving While Black.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Check out her ideas about how schoolchildren should be raised
_ that's why we all pump her up,'' Prince said. ``Ananda is
Cleopatra. You know she's a queen.''
</P>
<P>
   A truck-driving queen, perhaps. When Ms. Lewis does the town,
it's not in the de rigueur Mercedes-Benz or stretch Hummer
limousine but behind the wheel of her Toyota pickup truck or a Ford
family car. She does not affect the materialistic swagger of rap
divas like Lil' Kim or Foxy Brown. Her personality is a blend of
innocence and worldliness: She has sashayed down the catwalk at a
charity fashion show with the icy pout of a supermodel, but she's
still so much the show business ingenue that her publicist and
manager berate her for giving out her cell phone number to all and
sundry. (Ananda, your voice mail is too full to accept messages
again!)
</P>
<P>
   On the Friday before Halloween, after serving as the host of
MTV's late-afternoon video show ``Total Request Live,'' Ms. Lewis
swung by the taping of her friend Chris Rock's HBO comedy show. She
was late, and one of the show's producers, not recognizing her,
barked that she'd lost her seat to a last-minute fill-in.
</P>
<P>
   She was unfazed. In her low-cut Roberto Cavalli blouse and
chocolate-colored, square-toed snakeskin boots, she stood in the
wings with the staff and whooped as Rock ad-libbed a bit about the
meager salaries at Black Entertainment Television (``They pay you
in sandwiches''), and she was then whisked backstage, where the
wiry comedian greeted her with a kiss and a promise to book her on
the show soon.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for her MTV-supplied Town Car outside, Ms. Lewis was
spotted by four young women on their way to Ricky Martin's sold-out
Madison Square Garden concert. ``Ananda!'' they shrieked. ``We just
watched you on TRL!'' They lined up next to her for a snapshot, and
one blurted out, ``This is, like, my biggest thrill since I had my
baby.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Young mommies in full effect,'' Ms. Lewis said as the
disposable camera snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Her evening was only beginning. She raced downtown to make an
appearance at the 15th-anniversary party of the restaurant
Indochine and then, dismissing her chauffeured Lincoln, drove her
Ford Focus on an airport run to pick up her friend Omar Epps, the
star of the recent thriller ``In Too Deep.'' He was flying in from
Los Angeles for a photo shoot. (Driving all the way to Kennedy
Airport to fetch a buddy may not be the most New York of pastimes,
but Ms. Lewis, raised in San Diego, is still a Californian at
heart.)
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was the week of the final World Series games, and at 12:30
a.m. Ms. Lewis and Epps arrived at Veruka, the Broome Street club,
for a celebration of the Yankees' victory. They found the
velvet-roped boite more crowded than a rush-hour subway platform,
and they were squished onto banquettes next to Michael J. Fox, Jon
Voigt, Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Kevin Spacey posed with a teddy bear that was wearing a
Yankees sweater, and Ms. Lewis remarked that it was the celebrities
themselves who seemed to be the toys on display. ``I'd love to
dance right now, but we can't even stand up,'' she complained,
fanning her face. She and Epps made a brief attempt, getting up on
the banquette to groove a little. Derek Jeter, dancing on his own
sliver of floor, held up his drink and smiled appreciatively as Ms.
Lewis shimmied her hips.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ready to bounce?'' Epps said, yawning and indicating the
door. Ms. Lewis nodded, and they threw themselves headlong into the
fray.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   MTV says that ``Hot Zone'' _ which includes, between videos, Ms.
Lewis' interviews with stars and her tips on stylish handbags or
the hair wax used by the Backstreet Boys _ has made her one of the
network's two most popular stars. (The other is Carson Daly.)
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past our talent was sometimes just pretty people who
could read cue cards,'' said Bob Kusbit, MTV's senior vice
president for production. ``But when we brought Ananda to MTV, we
decided we were going to do a lot more live television, and I was
first and foremost interested in her ability to do live TV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got her here, we found that she really is in touch
with the music community,'' he said. ``She knows these people,
hangs out with these people, likes and listens to the music. It's
really a part of her.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The night after Epps' arrival, Ms. Lewis took him to the MTV
studio on Times Square for a 10th-anniversary party for ``House of
Style,'' the cable fashion show. Dressed in a saffron-colored sari
and matching pants, Ms. Lewis nibbled sushi, waved to the cheering
mob gathered below on Broadway and worked the room alongside the
fashion princesses Cindy Crawford, Daisy Fuentes and Rebecca
Romijn-Stamos. Then, picking up a Startac phone, she set up a
late-night rendezvous with Prince.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you call him, anyway?'' Epps asked with a sly smile.
``Do you say, `Hello, Artist'? Do you say, `Artist, how are you'''?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis rolled her eyes. ``When I call you up, do I say,
`Hello, Omar?''' she said. ``Or do I just say, `Hey, what's up'?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis and Epps said they were not dating, but are just
friends. And Ms. Lewis also denied any romantic connection with
Prince, whom she called ``the very happily married Artist.'' In an
article she wrote for the November 1998 issue of YM magazine, she
said she had decided to be celibate for six months, and though her
time is up, she is not in a serious relationship, she said the
other day.
</P>
<P>
   Epps and Ms. Lewis caught up with Prince after midnight at a
Halloween party given by Noel Ashman, the club owner and promoter,
at One51, the nightclub formerly known as Tatou. In a VIP section
within the VIP section, Ms. Lewis stopped to greet Mike Tyson
before sitting down beside Prince and ordering a double espresso.
</P>
<P>
   She barely had time to glance at her coffee before her quiet
tete-a-tete turned into a noisy pile-on, as Puffy Combs, Jennifer
Lopez and a posse climbed into her booth. Then Derek Jeter arrived,
squeezing in next to Combs and trailing an army of young women
straining to get close enough to smell the beer on the Yankee
shortstop's breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loochie groupies,'' Ms. Lewis complained.
</P>
<P>
   As the crush grew more intense, Ms. Lopez, in skintight white
pants and a diamond belly chain, said she didn't appreciate the
lack of breathing space. ``They're about to see the ghetto come out
of me,'' she snapped.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Lewis maintained her equanimity; she and Epps did a
little dance to the Southern hip-hop hit ``Bling Bling'' before
Epps drifted away to dance with another woman he'd just met.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis murmured a secret about the life of an It Girl:
there's little fun inside the VIP's VIP area. The stars sit around
and are stared at. They talk of going someplace else where they
would have room to dance.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's easy to complain from inside the charmed circle.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the Halloween party, a gossip columnist who had
observed Ms. Lewis and her friends from afar at One51 but had not
heard their conversation spun an overcooked tale of a love triangle
in which Ms. Lewis was pulled between Epps and Prince.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of pathetic,'' Ms. Lewis, who has previously been
linked to the singer Maxwell and the basketball star Shaquille
O'Neal, said later. ``A woman still can't be seen in the company of
a male friend without them making it be about somebody trying to
bed somebody. Nine times out of 10, if I'm actually dating someone,
I'm never out with them in public.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some days later, Ms. Lewis' It Girl schedule was taking its
toll, and she was suffering from a nasty cold. Still, she was due
for the evening at Club Ohm in Chelsea, where she had volunteered
to be a celebrity auctioneer of sports and music memorabilia at a
fund-raiser for Lifebeat, an AIDS charity. It wasn't her crowd:
many in attendance were raucous Howard Stern fans, and several
could be heard referring to Ms. Lewis leeringly. One drunken young
man bombarded her with questions about ``The Real World,'' an MTV
show she has nothing to do with.
</P>
<P>
   Sucking on a vitamin C tablet and sounding hoarse, Ms. Lewis
stood onstage with the volleyball player Gabrielle Reece and Gary
Dell'Abate, aka Baba Booey, the producer of Stern's radio show. He
kept mispronouncing Ms. Lewis' first name, rhyming it with Amanda.
Ms. Lewis remained the anti-diva, smiling patiently, letting him
get her name wrong several more times before whispering a
correction in his ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' Dell'Abate sheepishly announced. ``It's An-AHN-da.
An-AHN-da. I'll remember it now.''

RERUNNING THE GOLDEN AGE OF COMMUNIST TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, Nov. 22)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As if citizens of the former Soviet Union weren't suffering
enough, what with political unrest, rampant crime and few, if any,
Starbucks, they will soon be subjected to reruns of
communist-propaganda television.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Reuters news story, Czechs and Slovaks will soon
be able to relive the Golden Age of commie TV by tuning in such
nostalgic Soviet-era hits as ``Festival of Political Songs,''
``Russian Lectures'' and the movie ``A Skirt, But a Green One,''
the story of ``a secondary school student who resisted her parents
and gave up the love of a boy to be able to join a military
university.''
</P>
<P>
   An afternoon movie, ``He Who Searches Finds,'' exposes the
``abuses blocking the development of socialist economy in a
washing-machine company.''
</P>
<P>
   Shows like these will undoubtedly have viewers looking forward
to the ``dead time'' between programs when the camera is focused on
wallpaper of playful kittens, sometimes for hours at a time.
</P>
<P>
   I will leave it to the TV critics to decide whether an hour-long
shot of kitten wallpaper is better or worse than ``Greed: The
Multi-Million Dollar Challenge'' or whether a movie about a
Soviet-era washing-machine factory is likely to destroy more brain
cells than, say, Jerry Springer.
</P>
<P>
   American TV is loaded with propaganda too, of course. It's
called advertising. The difference between the two kinds of
propaganda is what is being sold and how one goes about selling it.
The Soviets were trying to sell communism. They did this by
producing such shows as ``Russian Lectures'' and ``Festival of
Political Songs.'' This is one reason why the Soviet Union no
longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   Americans sell beer and razors and cars and diet colas and
steaks and you name it by having physically fit young men and women
run around a beach in skimpy swimwear. The premise, apparently, is
that if you buy the advertised brand of, say, hemorrhoid ointment,
you will soon be frisking about the beach with these very same
physically fit young men and women in skimpy swimwear instead of
doing what you do now, which is basically spending all your waking
moments looking around for a soft place to sit.
</P>
<P>
   This explains why America is the greatest country in the world
and also the biggest consumer of hemorrhoid ointment.
</P>
<P>
   It's scary to think how different the world might be if the
Soviets had tried to sell communism with the help of physically fit
young men and women tripping around the beach in skimpy swimmer
rather than with dingy washing-machine factories, boring lectures
and improbable tales of lovestruck young women marching off to
military school.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of standing in line for three hours for a pound of
rancid bacon, Russians could be ordering gourmet meals over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of standing by helplessly while their economy turns to
dust, Russians could be day-trading in dot com stocks. They
wouldn't even need to know what a dot com stock is _ it might
simply be a fancy name for hemmorhoid ointment _ such is the beauty
of swimwear-fueled capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets, like us, would discover too late that swimwear
propaganda is a lie, just as communism is a lie. By that time
they'd have an adjustable-rate mortgage, car payments, tapped-out
credit cards, two kids in college (not military school), mole
crickets in the yard and a washing machine that makes a noise like
a Russian political song played backward.
</P>
<P>
   Not a perfect system, by any stretch, but you've got to admit
it's better than staring at kitty wallpaper all day.

   REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS SPAR OVER WHO WON THE BUDGET WAR
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As House members wrapped up work on a $400 billion
budget deal, both sides were crowing, but neither side could claim
an all-out win.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Democrats had plenty to brag about. They won more
money for a host of President Clinton's priorities, including a
community police program, education, land conservation, and a
payment plan for U.S. dues owed to the United Nations. Clinton also
forced Republicans to strip from the final bill several land and
mining provisions that environmentalists disliked.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, the Democrats have gotten what they wanted,''
said South Carolina Rep. John Spratt, the top Democrat on the House
Budget Committee. ``It's pretty impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed some Republicans conceded the GOP leadership adopted a
different _ and risky _ strategy this year by boosting spending in
some areas despite the long-standing pledge to cut the size of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a long-term strategy to take the decision-making
out of Washington and then funding can follow,'' said Rep. Jim
DeMint, a South Carolina Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans claim they paid for this year's budget without
dipping into the Social Security surplus (thanks to a few
accounting gimmicks), reduced the national debt and forced the
president to accept a 0.38 percent across-the-board spending cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a good victory for Congress and a great one for the
American people,'' declared Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans might have scored their biggest gain simply by
holding their own against a White House that has in the past
trumped them in budget talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is that since we have such a small
majority, all we can do is hold down the president's spending
increases and in that sense I think this is a success,'' said Rep.
Cliff Stearns, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   SEEING RED
</P>
<P>
   Southern lawmakers who represent textile-producing states aren't
exactly thrilled with the new trade agreement with China.
</P>
<P>
   While the deal would open China's economy to foreign competitors
and make it a full partner in the world's trading system, critics
say it will also accelerate losses in the textile and apparel
industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senator would like to congratulate the president on the
biggest jobs giveaway program this country has ever seen and he
will do everything he can to stop it from being implemented,'' said
Maury Lane, a spokesman for Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Spratt, who comes from a South Carolina district
dotted with textile mills, said the domestic textile industries
would likely face tough times because of the changing nature of
world economics, regardless of the new China deal. Still, he said,
this latest deal is ``not welcome news.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress will not vote on the deal itself, but lawmakers will
consider whether to do away with an annual review of China's trade
policies, a condition of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   AGING VETERANS
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of aging veterans who have retired to the Sunbelt
would have more access to nursing care provided by the Department
of Veterans Affairs under landmark congressional legislation.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators agreed on a final veterans measure
that would guarantee long-term care to those with serious
service-connected disabilities and open the door to serving many
others.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., the chief architect of the
legislation, was unable to push forward his plan to begin
negotiations that could lead to the closing of under-used VA
facilities, many of them in the Northeast and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just scared too many members,'' said Stearns, who met
fierce resistance from lawmakers worried that hospitals in their
districts might be closed. Stearns and others argue that billions
of dollars are spent on unneeded buildings when that money could be
funneled into direct care.
</P>
<P>
   TOBACCO CLOUT
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and anti-smoking advocates say the GOP
leadership stuck with Big Tobacco during the tense budget
negotiations, protecting the industry from some potentially costly
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did lawmakers reject a cigarette tax increase to pay
for added spending, Republican bargainers pulled the plug on a $20
million request to fund a federal lawsuit against tobacco companies
and blocked an administration proposal for heavier penalties for
selling cigarettes to minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was killed because there are people in positions, I think
in leadership positions, who objected to it,'' said Jack Lew, head
of the Office of Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   GOP officials dismissed the criticism, saying the administration
raised the tobacco issue only at the last minute.

UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE GETS BOWLES PAPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del.)  (mk) 
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Bowles, the expatriate American writer and composer who
died on Thursday in Tangier, Morocco, at 88, transferred the bulk
of his literary papers, 50 cartons of annotated manuscripts,
notebooks and correspondence, to the University of Delaware
Library, which has planned a major exhibition of his work for next
year. The acquisition was arranged and shipped earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Librarians beginning to catalog the collection said it included
an unpublished journal, fragments of unfinished work, poems,
stories, translations, photographs and hundreds of letters from
20th-century notables who visited Bowles and his wife, Jane, in
Morocco. They had made their home there since 1947, two years
before he published his most famous novel, ``The Sheltering Sky.''
Jane, also a writer, died in 1973 after a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept telling us he had nothing,'' said Francis Poole,
associate librarian of the university in Newark, Del., who was a
teacher in Tangier when he met Bowles in 1979, beginning a 20-year
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Last March and again in September, Poole and Timothy Murray, the
library's director of special collections, visited Bowles in
Tangier to arrange the acquisition, for which Murray said the
university expended only a few thousand dollars, for postage and a
modest payment to Bowles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were scattered all over the place,'' said Murray of the
papers they found throughout Bowles' modest one-bedroom apartment,
where he lived under the care of his longtime Moroccan butler,
Abdelouahed Bouliach.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the first letters examined were from Allen Ginsberg,
William Burroughs, Gregory Corso and other leaders of the Beats,
who grew close to Bowles while gravitating to Tangier's mysticism
and drug subculture in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   One letter Bowles wrote to Jane from Bangkok in 1966 has a
novelistic ring: ``I was wandering in the Pharmane Market last
week, the only European in sight among tens of thousands of Thais
and Chinese. Suddenly somebody pushed me and said: `Aren't you
Bowles?' I looked, and it was Irving Gelles, who used to live next
door to number 15 Itesa _ the mystery man with the codes and radio,
whom everyone disliked and suspected of one thing or another. He
was just as mysterious as ever, going to buy clothes, he said, in
the market, and accompanied by a Thai youth. He grinned guiltily
and said: I'm living in Laos now.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Delaware Library has an association with
Bowles going back to acquisitions in the late 1960s, as part of its
literary collections of Hemingway, Tennessee Williams and others.
The University of Texas at Austin also has a large Bowles
collection, but the latest acquisition, Delaware librarians said,
undoubtedly makes theirs the largest. In 1990 Delaware mounted a
show, ``Paul Bowles at 80,'' and it was preparing to exhibit the
latest trove for a show at the end of next year to be called ``Paul
Bowles at 90.'' The posthumous show will go on, Poole said.
</P>
<P>
   During the September visit, Poole videotaped an interview with
Bowles, surely one of the most interviewed figures of the age but
in recent years increasingly frail and nearly blind from glaucoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does it feel to be almost 90?'' Poole asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm not there yet,'' Bowles replied. ``I may never get
there. I'm only 80-what, 88. I don't know. One has the same body
but it doesn't work right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you still have ideas for stories?'' Poole asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Bowles replied, ``but I don't pay attention to them
because I know I can't get them out.''

 &HT;    ARMY MOVING TOWARD NURSE-ADMINISTERED ANESTHESIA
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - The Army is considering a move to allow
unsupervised nurses to administer anesthesia, the issue over which
a Navy captain recently was relieved of his command.
</P>
<P>
   The specially trained nurses, known as certified registered
nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), would administer drugs to induce sleep
or block pain and monitor the condition of anesthetized patients
without physician supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The practice would be restricted to patients whose illness is
not considered serious and whose overall health is good.
</P>
<P>
   Under current Army policy, use of anesthesia must be supervised
by anesthesiologists or other physicians.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson confirmed that policy is being ``reexamined'' but
said no decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Alvin Manalaysay, chief anesthesiologist at the National
Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., was relieved of his command
Nov. 11 for refusing to obey an order to authorize CRNAs to
administer anesthesia without physician supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Other physicians said that in ordering the change, Rear Adm.
Bonnie Potter, commander of the hospital, said anesthesiologists
would continue to supervise use of the drugs on high government
officials or other dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement issued Friday, Potter denied ever making
such a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not condone, nor have I ever directed my staff to deliver
a different level of care based on a patient's so-called VIP
status,'' she said in the written statement. ``The same high level
of health care is provided to all our patients.''
</P>
<P>
   In her statement, Potter said the procedures she had ordered at
Bethesda have been Navy practice for several years and, in
continuing to require physician supervision of the procedures, the
hospital had not been ``in compliance'' with Navy policy.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, involving the ``scope of practice'' of CRNAs, has
been contentious for several years, with the nurses arguing that
they are fully trained and qualified to administer the drugs
without direct physician supervision, both in military and civilian
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   They point out that nurses were administering anesthesia before
the medical specialty of anesthesiology even existed.
</P>
<P>
   Anesthesiologists counter that, with the introduction of new
drugs and procedures, the practice of their specialty has become
increasingly complex. Potentially fatal problems can develop
suddenly when a patient is under anesthesia, requiring rapid
response by a physician, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a shortage of anesthesiologists, the Army Medical Command
two months ago drafted a change in the scope of practice of CRNAs
to authorize their unsupervised use of anesthesia in healthy adults
and children more than 24 months old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reexaming this issue,'' said Medical Command
spokesperson Cynthia Vaughn. ``However, no decisions to change the
policy have been made.''

   ANESTHETISTS _ WASHINGTON _ The Army surgeon general is
reviewing a proposal to allow specially-trained nurses to direct
the use of anesthesia to some patients at Army hospitals. A draft
of the proposal states that certified registered nurse-anesthetists
will be supervised only when giving the sleep-inducing drugs to
children less than 24 months old and to more seriously ill adults.
Currently, Army policy requires the nurses to be supervised by
physician anesthesiologists when putting patients to sleep. If
approved, the new policy would follow a similar change instituted
recently at the National Naval Medical Center. In a statement
released Friday, the Navy denied statements by anestheologists that
the Bethesda hospital would continue to provide anesthesiologist
supervision for high government officials and other ``VIPs'' who
are treated there. (Nesmith, Cox News Service)

   MICROSOFT _ WASHINGTON _ In a surprise development, the judge in
the Microsoft antitrust trial appointed a mediator Friday to

Jackson is seen as an effort to prod the parties to reach an
out-of-court agreement. The mediator is Richard Posner, the chief
judge for the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago. (Glass,

UNCIVIL ACTION: A TOWN LEFT TO DIE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LIBBY, Mont. _ First, it killed some miners.
</P>
<P>
   Then it killed wives and children, slipping into their homes on
the dusty clothing of hard-working men.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mine is closed, but in Libby, the killing goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The W.R. Grace Co. knew, from the time it bought the Zonolite
vermiculite mine in 1963, why the people in Libby were dying. But
for the 30 years it owned the mine, the company did not stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the governments.
</P>
<P>
   Not the town of Libby, not Lincoln County. Not the state of
Montana, not federal mining, health and environmental agencies, not
anyone else charged with protecting the public health.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what is killing people in Libby:
</P>
<P>
   Along with the enormous deposits of vermiculite in the earth of
nearby Zonolite Mountain are millions of tons of tremolite, a rare
and exceedingly toxic form of asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   For eons, the tremolite lay undisturbed and harmless beneath a
thin crust of topsoil. But mining the vermiculite has released the
deadly asbestos fibers into the air.
</P>
<P>
   A Post-Intelligencer investigation has shown that at least 192
people have died from the asbestos in the mine's vermiculite ore,
and doctors say the toll could be much higher. The doctors and
Libby's long-suffering families say that at least another 375
people have been diagnosed with fatal diseases caused by this
silent and invisible killer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan Whitehouse, a lung specialist from Spokane and an
expert in industrial diseases, said another 12 to 15 people from
Libby are being diagnosed with the diseases _ asbestosis,
mesothelioma, lung cancer _ every month.
</P>
<P>
   It takes anywhere from 10 to 40 years from the time a person is
exposed to dangerous amounts of asbestos for the diseases to reveal
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   So in Libby, the killing goes on.

</P>
<P>
   The W.R. Grace Co. says it did no harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we feel we met our obligation to our workers and to
the community,'' said Jay Hughes, Grace's senior litigation
counsel. Hughes said Grace spent ``millions'' to upgrade safety
conditions and reduce dust at the mine.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1984, 187 civil actions have been filed against Grace
on behalf of Libby's miners and their families. There are 120 cases
pending. In the others, Grace has either been found liable and been
ordered to pay damages in a jury trial, or it settled out of court,
often shortly before the trial was to begin. Scores of new suits
are expected as more former workers, their families and other Libby
residents are diagnosed with cancer and other asbestos-spawned
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The district court in Libby is permitting only one civil action
against Grace every three months.
</P>
<P>
   The diseases do their work slowly, but not that slowly. Long
before they get their day in court, many more victims will die.
</P>
<P>
   A FAMILY'S NIGHTMARE
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Lincoln County are families torn apart by asbestos,
but none has paid a higher price than the Bundrocks. Six of the
family's seven members have been diagnosed with asbestos-related
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Bundrock worked at the mine for 19 years. He died last
summer on the front lawn of his house, having left his oxygen
bottle inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hated being tied to that green bottle. It let him live, but
took his freedom. He'd always sneak off without it,'' said his
widow, Helen.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Bundrock suffered for 21 years. His pain was not just
from the disease, but from the knowledge that the white, talc-like
dust he carried home from the mine every day had attacked the lungs
of all of his family but one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got it,'' said Helen, ``and so do Donna, Robin, Mary and
Bill. Only my youngest, Cindy, hasn't been diagnosed with it, and
we're all praying for her.''
</P>
<P>
   As one after another of his family became sick, Art's pain grew
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like tearing his heart out piece by piece,'' Helen
said. ``He never quit crying for two weeks when I found out that I
had it. And with the children, he just couldn't be consoled.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that managers at the mine told miners the dust was
harmless _ a claim echoed by other miners and denied by W.R. Grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lied, but they did worse than that,'' she said, talking
about when her son, now 46, went to work for Grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill had to get a chest X-ray before they hired him. That
X-ray showed he had asbestosis and they never told him. They just
let him go to work up there with all that poison. They never told
him for the 10 years he worked there.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Bundrock said she's fighting it as her husband did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what's in store for me and my children, but I keep at
it. I force myself to walk the two blocks to the post office. I
can't give in.''
</P>
<P>
   But she's worried about the future of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I live is not far where they processed that stuff and
the sparkles (from the vermiculite) are all over the place,'' she
said. ``Lots of kids play around here. I hope they won't be the
next generation to suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   HUGE AMOUNTS OF ASBESTOS
</P>
<P>
   West of Libby, the Cabinet Mountains rise more than 8,000 feet,
providing a beautiful and dramatic backdrop to the town of 2,700.
</P>
<P>
   Three miles east, as the winds blow, is a smaller mountain,
Zonolite Mountain, the life-and-death mountain. Life, because more
than 1,900 men and women earned their living at the mine. Death,
because of the way the mine was operated. Death, because of the
tremolite. The mine and mill processed an astonishing amount of
asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   According to W.R. Grace records and court documents, nearly
300,000 pounds of asbestos a day went through the ``dry mill,'' the
primary ore-processing facility and the dustiest building on the
property. By 1975, Grace had built a new mill and production had
doubled, which means more than half a million pounds of asbestos a
day were processed.
</P>
<P>
   Tests in 1969 showed that 24,000 pounds of dust a day were
expelled from the large stack on the dry mill. The dust was about
20 percent asbestos, and had tested as high as 40 per cent. So even
at 1969 production levels, at least 5,000 pounds of asbestos a day
were spewed from the dry mill stack. And there were several other
stacks in operation as well.
</P>
<P>
   Dust from the stacks blanketed the nearby mine buildings, where
most of the workers were, and much of the mountainside. It did not
have to snow for Zonolite Mountain to be white.
</P>
<P>
   Some days, when the east wind blew, sheets on the clotheslines
of Libby would be covered in the dust, and children would write
their names in the dust on their parents' cars.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehouse, the Spokane doctor, specializes in lung cancers,
pneumonia and industrial diseases that affect the lungs. His
background is extensive and varied, and includes working for NASA,
where he ran a pulmonary laboratory for the Apollo moon-landing
project.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every doctor in and around Libby has sent patients the
180 miles to Whitehouse. He has evaluated and/or treated more than
200 of them for various diseases caused by exposure to tremolite.
More Libby patients suffering from asbestos-related disease are
being treated by other doctors in Spokane, as well as in Kalispell,
Boise, Portland, Salt Lake City and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   None of the ways of dying from asbestos is easy, or pretty.
</P>
<P>
   The main illnesses caused by airborne asbestos are mesothelioma,
or cancer of the pleural lining of the lung; cancer of the lung
itself; and asbestosis, a thickening and scarring of the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   The microscopic asbestos fibers are so small they hang suspended
in the air for extended periods. When inhaled, they can penetrate,
then irritate the lung. The lung cannot remove an asbestos fiber
that has speared into its tissue. It cannot be coughed out or
washed out of the tissue by blood. So the area around the fiber
becomes inflamed, and eventually the site becomes scarred.
</P>
<P>
   Over a period of years it becomes impossible to take a deep
breath. The tissue changes from the elasticity and thickness of a
balloon to that of a thick orange peel. When breathing is
restricted, oxygen cannot get into the lungs and carbon dioxide and
other impurities cannot get out.
</P>
<P>
   The pain of death by asbestosis is no secret in this town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all had family and friends die and we watched and held
them,'' Gayla Benefield said. ``The heart is the last organ to go,
so they're alive until the end, until the fluids fill their lungs
and they suffocate.''
</P>
<P>
   SHARPLY POINTED FIBERS
</P>
<P>
   Whitehouse has seen many examples of asbestos disease, but he
says the Libby cases are different.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the fibers of other types of asbestos, tremolite's fibers
are needle-like and sharply pointed and therefore penetrate the
lining of the lungs more easily, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the various types of asbestos, tremolite is considered by
many researchers to be the most carcinogenic.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, when the miners and their families complained
to their doctors of respiratory problems, even when they coughed up
blood, they were often told they had bronchitis, or asthma or the
flu. Many say Whitehouse was the first to tell them the real nature
of their diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the latency period _ the time from the inhalation of
fibers to the onset of disease _ Whitehouse said that people
exposed to asbestos before the mine closed in 1990 will be dying
for decades to come. Also, he said, studies have shown that fibers
can remain in a house for 15 years after being brought in on dusty
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be seeing this until the year 2030,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   `THERE ARE MY FOLKS'
</P>
<P>
   The frost-covered brown grass crunches under Gayla's feet as she
walks slowly through wisps of fog at the Libby Cemetery. She goes
to the graveyard every Wednesday, because it holds so many of her
friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are my folks,'' she said, pointing to the markers
engraved with the names Perley Vatland and Margaret Vatland. ``Dad
was 62 and mom was 76. The mine killed them both.''
</P>
<P>
   She looks up from the graves and stares into the middle
distance, remembering. ``Dad came home covered in white dust and it
was all over the place. Mom was a fanatic about keeping the house
clean. She bought the newest Kirby vacuum but it would just suck in
the fibers but blow them right into the air. The filters couldn't
stop them. Not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   She points to the next row of markers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Butch and John worked up there and they both died of lung
cancer. Gladys was a secretary at the mine. The dust got her,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind her was another row of granite slabs, commemorating more
workers at Zonolite Mountain. More lay in the next row, and the
next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the old men in this town,'' she said. ``The loggers
may be banged up and bent over but they're still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gayla Benefield sued W.R. Grace for the death of her mother, and
won a damage award. She could not sue on her father's behalf
because his illness had been covered by workers' compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothered me that we couldn't make the company accountable
for killing my father. They knew there was asbestos in that dust.
Grace's files are filled with hundreds of studies and reports of
the dangers and as many letters to and from Grace's headquarters
about what they should do about it. But they did nothing but cover
it up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Grace acknowledged at trial that Gayla's mother had died because
of exposure to asbestos from the mine. The company lawyer said the
company was ``very sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   In defending itself in cases involving Margaret Vatland's death
and the deaths of other miners' wives and children, Grace's lawyers
told juries that until 1973, neither state nor federal inspectors
had ever told them there was a danger to their employees' families.
In 1973, the lawyers recalled, a U.S. Bureau of Mines inspector
told the company, ``You should put some changing rooms in so that
people going home don't expose their families.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched that dust kill my mother,'' Gayla said. She was ``a
strong, independent woman who always took care of herself, tied to
a green oxygen tank, too weak to walk 20 feet, dying the most
painful death imaginable. And now I'm worried about the same thing
happening to my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Her personal battle with Grace over, Gayla has become a
persistent, solitary voice pushing for people, especially the
government, to look at her town, to study what happened to the
miners and their families, and to examine what's happening today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people here just want me to let it all die,'' Gayla says.
``But that's what it's all about, people dying. I just want someone
to make sure that the next generation doesn't die of the same thing
that killed their parents and grandparents.''
</P>
<P>
   FIRST LINK IN 1900
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos has been used for centuries, but it wasn't until 1900
that a physician first linked the fiber to the death of a patient.
A London physician conducted an autopsy on a 34-year-old patient
who slowly lost the ability to breathe and eventually suffocated.
The doctor found massive scarring and asbestos fibers embedded in
the man's lungs. The patient had worked for 16 years in a factory
that made textiles from asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   In 1924, the same year the Zonolite mine began operation, the
British Medical Journal published its first study naming asbestos
as a cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-30s, pathologists at Presbyterian-University Hospital
in Pittsburgh reported finding asbestos in the lungs of 46 of 100
asbestos factory workers they had autopsied.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irving Selikoff, who headed the Environmental Science
Laboratory at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital, is considered the
father of asbestos health research in the United States. He
reconfirmed the hazards of the fiber in 1964, when he published his
studies into the deaths of hundreds of asbestos workers in the
'40s, '50s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, production at the Zonolite mine was surging.
</P>
<P>
   To trace the mine's effect on Libby, the P-I examined 6,000
pages of company documents, medical records, federal and state
inspections and interviewed more than 110 safety, health and
environmental investigators, former employees and their families or
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, the Montana Board of Health, Division of Disease
Control, inspected the plant and found that ``asbestos dust in the
air is of considerable toxicity.'' Investigators found enormous
quantities of dust and inoperative exhaust systems'' and called for
broad improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half years later, the health board followed up to
``determine if any of the components ... found to be detrimental to
the health of the employees in August 1956 had been reduced or
alleviated.'' The inspectors listed deficiencies on four
single-spaced pages, detailing areas where high concentrations of
asbestos-laden dust spewed from the pipes, chutes and machinery.
</P>
<P>
   They repeated a warning they had made in 1956: ``Inhalation of
asbestos dust must be expected sooner or later to produce pulmonary
fibrosis ... pulmonary asbestosis, once established, is a
progressive disease with a bad prognosis.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, workers were beginning to experience respiratory
problems. The first miner to be diagnosed with asbestosis was Glenn
Taylor. In February 1959, after he'd worked 19 at the mine, doctors
at the state tuberculosis hospital determined that the disease that
was robbing Taylor's ability to breathe was not TB, but asbestosis.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Taylor's case and the ones that followed, many of the
mine's workers maintain that Grace waited at least 15 years before
it conceded that there was anything hazardous in the dust that
often covered them.
</P>
<P>
   `OF COURSE THEY KNEW'
</P>
<P>
   In its defense before various juries, Grace has maintained that
it, and the Zonolite Co. before it, was using the latest safety and
health information available to the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even before Grace bought the mine, more than a dozen
reports by the Montana Health Department and the U.S. Bureau of
Mines cited the high concentrations of asbestos in the vermiculite
dust blanketing the operation. The 1956 state report warning of the
asbestos dust's ``considerable toxicity'' is a prime example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they knew there was asbestos up there,'' said Les
Skramstad, who worked at the mine for two years and is dying of
cancer from the fibers. ``They used to have us drive up to the mine
and fill up our pickup truck with piles of raw asbestos off the
mine face. We'd bring it back to town, where the researchers would
experiment with it, trying to find something they could make out of
it to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1969 internal report, directed to the desk of company
President Peter Grace, warned that ``tremolite is definitely a
health hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, the W.R. Grace senior attorney, said the company
monitored the health of its workers ever since it bought the mine
in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Little, a radiologist who did the first chest X-rays
of the workers in 1964, found a ``great deal of lung abnormalities
among the employees ... far in excess of what one would find in
examining the normal population.''
</P>
<P>
   Little said the situation was ``even more severe when
considering he was examining young, hardy workmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the X-ray results were sent to the miners' family
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of workers and their survivors acknowledged in P-I
interviews that the X-rays were taken. But all said that they were
never told the results.
</P>
<P>
   Grace correspondence from November 1967 said: ``The only persons
aware of the studies are (Grace) officials and Dr. Little.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of workers with lung abnormalities was frightening to
some of the doctors involved.
</P>
<P>
   A 1969 series of X-rays showed that almost half of the people
who had worked at the mine for 11 to 20 years had lung disease of
some type. Among the employees who had worked at the mine for 21 to
25 years, 92 percent were diseased.
</P>
<P>
   Even Grace's insurance company cautioned Grace about not moving
quickly enough to inform workers of the health problems the
company's medical surveillance detected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly when an X-ray picture shows a change for the worse,
that person must be told,'' said a December 1969 letter from
Maryland Casualty Co. ``Failure to do so is not humane and is in
direct violation of federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   NOT PERMANENT SOLUTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, the Grace attorney, emphasized that the company's
issuance of respirators to workers was more evidence that the
company was taking the health threat seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Grace documents showed a different side of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Respirators or other respiratory protective devices should not
be considered as permanent solutions to any processing procedures
which create contamination of the atmosphere,'' a Grace safety
officer wrote in January 1965.
</P>
<P>
   At least six state and federal inspection reports in the '60s
and '70s raised the same concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did have respirators, but the dust was so heavy most of the
time that they clogged up within minutes,'' recalls Skramstad.
``You had a choice of wearing them or breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Thom, the last union president before the closing, agrees.
``If you had a respirator on ... pretty soon it was clogged up, so
you just took it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the company worked closely with the workers' union
on safety issues, especially the high levels of dust.
</P>
<P>
   Thom remembers it differently. ``We did have discussions on the
dust. But the story was always the same: `It's just a nuisance
dust. It's not a problem.' But (for years) the company never told
us it contained asbestos, or anything dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, they told us that the dust contained tremolite,
not asbestos, and that tremolite was not hazardous,'' said Thom,
who worked at the plant from 1974 to 1992 and was a union officer
for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until 1979 that Grace admitted to us that tremolite
was a serious health threat.''
</P>
<P>
   REPORTS STAMPED `CONFIDENTIAL'
</P>
<P>
   The documents collected by the P-I also raise questions about
the role of the federal health investigators. At times it becomes
difficult to determine whether they were trying to protect the
workers or the company.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1969, the U.S. Public Health Service asked that
Grace provide data for a mortality study of asbestos workers. The
author of the letter, the epidemiology director of the Bureau of
Occupational Safety and Health, promised that the ``data would only
be published if no significant differences with Montana death rates
were shown.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the state inspection reports, four a year, from the
Montana health department, were stamped ``confidential'' and said
they were ``not for distribution except to the management'' of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   In internal memos, Grace lawyers said the confidentiality would
protect them from having the state reports used against them in
workers' compensation cases.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of confidentiality was the only way that state
inspectors could get into many industries at the time, according to
a Montana state employee who has researched the state's
environmental history.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the language in some of the reports showed
increasing frustration at the company's slow pace in getting the
lethal dust under control, there is not a single indication that
government inspectors ever threatened or even considered shutting
the plant down.
</P>
<P>
   A 1964 letter from Benjamin Wake of the Montana Board of Health
Division of Disease Control to Arthur Bundrock, then the union
secretary at the mine, offers some insight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enforcement provisions of the Industrial Hygiene Act ...
are very poor and various opinions, over the years, from the
attorney general's office have not strengthened the act,'' Wake
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Bureau of Mines was dismantled in the early 1990s, but
three former inspectors interviewed by the P-I agreed that the
political clout of the mining companies and their lobbyists,
especially in Western states, made taking strong actions against
offending mines almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have to have bodies stacked like cordwood and the
public screaming for someone's head before we could get the
government's lawyers to do anything,'' said Robert Jones, a former
Bureau of Mines inspector from Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Other federal agencies, as far away as Washington, D.C., knew
there were problems in Libby.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, a deputy U.S. attorney general who owned a cabin near
Libby blew the whistle. He reported to the Public Health Service
that ``there is a dust problem at Libby ... affecting workers and
the community.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1982 EPA investigation into asbestos-contaminated vermiculite
documented that significant levels of asbestos fibers were captured
by air samplers in downtown Libby.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned last week, health experts at the EPA and the U.S.
Public Health Service said they could find no indication that any
formal actions were taken or demands made to Grace while the mine
was operating about the asbestos conditions plaguing the workers.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of the asbestos to the miners' families could have
been halted in most cases by the simple installation of showers.
The request for showers went back long before Grace bought the
mine. The workers and their union often repeated the request.
</P>
<P>
   Even the federal government weighed in, but it didn't follow
through.
</P>
<P>
   An April 1973 U.S. Bureau of Mines report reminded Grace that
most employees wear their clothes to and from work and told the
company it needed showers so the workers could change out of their
dust-covered clothes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, when Grace opened a new, less dusty wet-process mill,
it had a shower room _ two showers for at least 60 men per shift.
</P>
<P>
   Workers wanted more, and they kept asking. In a February 1978
memo, Grace promised workers that ``there are plans for 1978 for
the installation of proper shower facilities for all employees.''
But no agency ever forced Grace to build those additional showers,
and the company never did so.
</P>
<P>
   John Wardell, the current coordinator of EPA's operation in
Montana, said there's a limit to what the government is responsible
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not responsible if the workers went home before being
properly decontaminated and brought asbestos into their homes.
That's a personal issue.''
</P>
<P>
   `KEEP THEM ON THE JOB'
</P>
<P>
   Early in its ownership of the mine, Grace sought ways to
minimize its financial obligation to asbestos victims. In an
internal memo marked ``personal and confidential'' written Jan. 5,
1968, Grace's safety chief, Peter Kostic, suggested reassigning 32
Libby workers whose X-rays showed disease to less dusty jobs. ``If
we minimize their exposure to dust ... chances are we may be able
to keep them on the job until they retire, thus precluding the high
cost of total disability,'' Kostic wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 1969 internal memo, another Grace executive wrote,
``The inclination of public agencies to protect the worker at any
expense (usually the employer's) ... should be of considerable
concern to us. Our recent experience at Libby ... may well create a
significant financial liability. We should also be concerned with
the obligation to our employees; namely, permitting them to perform
their services under working conditions which we have good reason
to believe are hazardous.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace's insurance carrier, Maryland Casualty Co. in Portland,
Ore., had told Grace two years earlier that its ``inability'' to
curb the asbestos contamination despite repeated warnings ``through
the years might be alleged at least to have constituted willful and
wanton conduct ... ''
</P>
<P>
   The insurer also urged Grace lawyers to prevent the entry of the
``confidential'' state inspection reports into evidence in a
workers' compensation case. The insurance company cautioned Grace
to ``keep them out of the hands of the Industrial Accident Board
and through it, the general public.''
</P>
<P>
   LIBBY'S ROUGH-HEWN ROOTS
</P>
<P>
   The Kootenai River, after flowing south from Canada, turns west
on its way to the Columbia. There at the bend, settlers, miners,
trappers and railroaders built the town in 1892, on the Great
Northern Railroad right of way.
</P>
<P>
   Libby is proud of its rough-hewn roots. On the grounds of the
town's Heritage Museum are an old loggers' cookhouse and a miner's
cabin, meticulously decorated by the Libby Women's Club.
</P>
<P>
   Today, like many Western towns, Libby is being forced to shift
its economy from those extractive industries, and the town is
trying hard to capture its share of new, supposedly healthier,
sources of income. Kootenai Falls was featured in the film ``The
River Wild,'' and the Chamber of Commerce is unabashedly and
successfully wooing tourists looking for outdoor adventure.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the old remains: the well-worn frame houses on
tree-shaded streets, the old German Lutheran church, now fashioned
into the remarkable Hidden Chapel Restaurant _ and a persistent
pro-mining attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Some townspeople think too much is being made of the deaths and
illness. Some of the families who have sued W.R. Grace have been
ostracized by their neighbors. When the film ``A Civil Action,'' a
true story about a lawyer for families who sued W.R. Grace in a
Massachusetts case, played at the Dome Theatre, attendance was
sparse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environmental politics of the nation don't always go over
well in small towns,'' Libby Mayor Tony Berget said. ``The
environmental laws have hurt the logging industry, and that has
cost us a lot of jobs. Add that to Grace closing the vermiculite
mine and it's been a rough 10 years for a lot of our people. Our
unemployment is between 14 and 16 per cent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Libby is a very trusting community and we trusted the
company,'' Leroy Thom said. ``We never considered they would do
anything that would harm their own employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were wrong.''

SEARCHING FOR GOLD, MINERS STARTED ON TRAIL THAT LED TO
VERMICULITE

   LIBBY, Mont. _ Prospectors first put pick and shovel to Zonolite
Mountain 119 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many mining-claim records are missing or illegible, but what can
be made out indicates that in 1881, Robert Rannie and his partner,
while searching for gold along a creek, dug a 40-foot-long shaft
following a vein of quartz.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight years later, Edward Alley, a part-time miner and
the owner of the Libby Hotel, stood in the same partially collapsed
shaft. As he moved his flaming torch around the dark hole, the
flame, glittering off mica-like crystals, brushed the top of the
shaft. Popping sounds echoed off the walls, and he noticed that the
sparkly material, heated by the flame, had expanded into large
puffy clusters, weighing next to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   When he held the flame beneath them, the clusters did not burn.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists told him that it wasn't mica, but a little-known
substance called vermiculite. Alley, a survivor of the
Spanish-American War who had taken a couple of geology classes at
the University of Nebraska, named it Zonolite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The raw material is but two feet under the cover of soil and
to a depth of 150 feet,'' Alley said. ``We've got a mountain of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Government scientists in Washington, D.C., told him he had
something unique and valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The chief mineral technologist at the U.S. Bureau of Mines
called the expansion of the vermiculite the most remarkable
phenomenon he had ever witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   By 1924, Alley had built a primitive roasting kiln that produced
four tons of Zonolite a day.
</P>
<P>
   On March 25, 1925, Great Northern Railroad shipped the first
boxcar of Zonolite from Libby to a Hillsboro, Ohio, company that
used it to insulate bank vaults, office safes and filing cabinets.
Also that year, a New York company developed a method of using
Zonolite to make building boards at half the weight and twice the
strength of wood. And a Billings, Mont., firm developed a new
``permanent'' roofing material using 70 percent Zonolite and 30
percent asphalt. They claimed it was fireproof and would ``last
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that year Alley sold his hotel and several other
properties in Libby and mortgaged his ranch to increase the size of
the operation. By mid-1926, he was running a much larger plant,
producing up to 100 tons a day.
</P>
<P>
   The process was simple. The vermiculite ore was stripped from
the top of the mountain and hauled in huge trucks to a mill, where
it was separated into various commercial sizes through a dusty
screening system. Some of the ore was shipped untouched. Other
material was sent to an expansion plant, where it was run through
ovens at about 2,000 degrees, causing it to ``pop''to 15 times its
size.
</P>
<P>
   Before Alley died in 1935, he shepherded the obscure mineral
into thousands of products being sold around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, Zonolite merged with another company mining the bottom
of the hill and became the Universal Zonolite Insulation Co. Nine
years later the name was changed to the Zonolite Co.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, the company was sold to W.R. Grace and Co. Very
quickly, Grace expanded the operation and increased production.
</P>
<P>
   Through the '60s, '70s and '80s, a near-continuous line of
Burlington Northern rail cars hauled millions of tons of the
vermiculite ore to Grace plants and other companies in 30 states
and six foreign countries. The featherweight material was showing
up in dozens of new products, from lawn fertilizer to fireproofing.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, 1,898 men and women worked at the mine, as many
as 332 at any one time, working two and sometimes three shifts a
day. At times, the miners were the best-paid workers in town.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 80 percent of the world's vermiculite came from Libby.
The rest came from South Africa and another Grace mine in South
Carolina. The workers were proud of what they were accomplishing.
In the history of the company there was only one strike. It lasted
27 days.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, when Grace closed the mine citing economic reasons,
company documents contained estimates that ``another 80 or 100
years worth of vermiculite can be pulled out of that mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Grace sold the property to three men _ two local
loggers and Jack Wolters, formerly vice president of Grace's
construction products division. Plans for the 4,000-acre site have
not been decided, said Mark Owens, one of the trio and a
third-generation logger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not really sure what we're going to do,'' Owens says.
``We may log and reforest it, perhaps build a wildlife area or
maybe some type of development.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his group might mine the mountain again, he would only
say, ``There's a lot of ore left in that hill.''

 &HT;    VIOLENT ANTI-U.S. PROTESTS GREET CLINTON IN GREECE, PROTESTERS
KEPT AT BAY
 &HT;    (750&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ President Clinton arrived here Friday night under
extraordinary security, as thousands of demonstrators hurled
firebombs, smashed windows and ran riot through downtown Athens to
protest his visit.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadow of the Acropolis, sirens wailed and helmeted
police bearing hand-held body shields fired tear gas to press back
an estimated 10,000 demonstrators as they closed in near the seat
of the Greek Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Retreating protesters smashed scores of shop windows, firebombed
more than a dozen banks and set fire to kiosks and trash cans,
cutting a mile-long swath of destruction through a fashionable
shopping district.
</P>
<P>
   Police reported minor injuries, no deaths and scattered arrests
from the worst violence of any of Clinton's overseas trips..
</P>
<P>
   Several blocks away, Clinton was kept far from the mayhem by a
massive corps of police and troops. They cast a tight security net
along the route his motorcade took into the city from the Ellinikon
International Airport. A phalanx of forces sealed off the
Presidential Palace, where he was hosted by Greek President
Konstandinos Stephanopoulos for a state dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators expressed anger over a litany of U.S. policies and
actions, including:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S.-led air strikes against Serbia, which has close
historical and cultural links to Greece;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  continuing U.S. containment of Iraq, enforced with almost
daily combat air patrols over the oil-rich country and frequent
attacks on Iraqi targets;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  a Cyprus policy that many Greeks regard as pro-Turkey;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and a long history of American political and influence many
here regard as excessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love American people,'' said a young law student in black
jeans named Eve. ``But we don't like your politics.''
</P>
<P>
   In a striking electronic tale of two cities, Greek newscasts
showed split-screen coverage of Clinton's formal arrival juxtaposed
against scenes of pandemonium in the streets nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to experiencing that wonderful quality of Greek
hospitality known to all the world as phyloxenia,'' Clinton said
upon his arrival at Ellinikon International. ``I want the American
people to see the changing face of Greece.''
</P>
<P>
   In the streets, though, was the face of rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious why we hate Clinton,'' said the young law
student, choking back a vile mix of smoke and tear gas. ``He gives
orders to kill people all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other demonstrators who spoke to American reporters, she
refused to give her full name.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton was kept far from the demonstrators, he was also
expecting them. He was forced to scrub a planned three-day trip
here last weekend due to anti-American demonstrations and violence.
His 24-hour visit, ending Saturday afternoon when he flies to
Florence, Italy, is a scaled-down substitute.
</P>
<P>
   In a state visit meant to shore up U.S. relations with a NATO
ally and economic partner along Europe's volatile southeastern
edge, Clinton sought to turn adversity to advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's wife, Hillary, their daughter, Chelsea, and Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright all were presented with bouquets of
flowers as they walked down the red carpet from Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   At the state dinner with President Stephanopoulos, Clinton said
Greece and the United States ``have forged a profound and enduring
friendship'' over the last 180 years.
</P>
<P>
   He tipped his hat to the ``long tradition of impassioned
political debate,'' in a country that developed a working democracy
six centuries before the birth of Christ. And he highlighted the
commitment to freedom of expression common to the United States and
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in all friendships, we have not always agreed, but we have
never broken ranks, because of our shared devotion to democracy and
freedom,'' Clinton said at the state dinner. ``If some engage us in
passionate debate, it is well to remember how hard both our
countries have fought for their right to do just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed at the media attention the protests stripped from
the substance of Clinton's state visit, a representative of the
Greek government visited a hotel where the traveling White House
press corps was holed up to say the demonstrators were not fully
representative of this country of 11.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is of enormous significance that an American president has
chosen to come to Greece,'' said Alex Rondos, an adviser to the
Greek foreign minister, Yeoryios Papandreou. ``If a few wish to
turn their backs on the president of the United States, I think
they're a distinctive, very, very small minority.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear, also, that Rondos was concerned about the image
the protests convey of a country hard at work trying to take its
place as the economic anchor of the southern Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a country which now is investing heavily on the stock
exchange, is moving to a free market, is liberalizing its economy,
is galloping into Europe,'' said Rondos. ``So, the few people who
still hold some strong ideological views, that's part of our
history.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Another part has been U.S. support for a military junta that
overthrew the Greek government in 1967, ushering in seven years of
harsh political repression under the thumb of successive dictators.
</P>
<P>
   That was near the height of the Cold War and Greece had a
vibrant communist movement, remnants of which still survive
alongside a deep suspicion of U.S. motives in general and Clinton's
trip here in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``His visit symbolizes for us the U.S. domination over Greece,
from the '70s until today,'' said a 40-year-old civil engineer
named Petridis. ``It also symbolizes the U.S. aggression against
other peoples, like Yugoslavia or in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   As a NATO member, Greece reluctantly went along with the
U.S.-led air campaign against Yugoslavia's Serbs last spring. Polls
showed, though, that some 96 percent of Greeks opposed the strikes,
and nightly anti-war protests in Athens swelled to a million
demonstrators during the 78-day campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Still others voiced outrage over the security sweep that shut
down much of Athens to protect Clinton and his entourage of several
hundred aides and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   With miles of streets and sidewalks cordoned off, much of this
picturesque city by the Aegean looked like a ghost town, its open
air restaurants and seaside cafes deserted on a warm moonlit Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the ancient cradle of Western democracy, citizens were
stopped, searched and told by
</P>
<P>
   police to go away, further fueling anti-American sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an insult to the Greek people,'' said a man named
Andreas, a 58-year-old Athenian journalist.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a brilliant but radical philosophy student in
Paris in the late 1920s, she was nicknamed the Red Virgin and the
Categorical Imperative in Skirts.
</P>
<P>
   But today Simone Weil is remembered mainly as a French Jew who
used her stunningly original intelligence to denigrate the Jews on
the eve of World War II and espouse a mystical Christianity of her
own invention.
</P>
<P>
   Last week French and American scholars gathered at Columbia
University for a conference to discuss her writings and her odd
combination of beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Why is there such interest in this young Frenchwoman with such
repugnant views on Jews? A woman who joined General Charles de
Gaulle's Free French in London before dying in 1943 at the age of
34 from tuberculosis aggravated by self-imposed starvation. (She
was trying to share the hardships of the occupation.) Even her
admirers speak of her as a kind of mad virtuoso.
</P>
<P>
   T.S. Eliot called her genius ``akin to that of the saints,''
while Albert Camus spoke of her ``madness for truth.'' At the
conference, Sylvere Lotringer, a professor of French literature at
Columbia, called Weil ``one of the great minds of the 1930s and
'40s, pushing her ideas to the limit without pity for anyone, in a
kind of delirium.''
</P>
<P>
   As a young teacher, Weil worked on behalf of the unemployed and
dreamed of restoring dignity to manual labor. She joined the
Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War, compared Hitler to
Julius Caesar and encouraged de Gaulle to unify the French
resistance by creating a National Council of the Resistance. Later,
she urged de Gaulle to ban political parties in postwar France
because their lust for power encouraged totalitarianism.
</P>
<P>
   Weil wanted to found an elite nursing group to tend wounded
soldiers at the front. Only months before her death, she begged to
be parachuted into occupied France on a secret mission _
``preferably a dangerous one.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, however, the conference was dominated by
Weil's hostility toward Judaism. She died before the horrors of the
Holocaust became known, but in general she saw the Israelites of
the Old Testament as cruel imperialists and their God as vengeful
and violent. The lives of the patriarchs were ``sullied with
atrocities,'' she said, while the prohibition against idolatry
encouraged ``the chosen people'' to self-worship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am paralyzed by the thought that I am accused of descending
from people who could not find anything better to give humanity
than Jehovah,'' Weil wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Christianity, she believed, sprang from the spirituality and
grace of ancient Greece but had been subverted by imperial Rome,
which turned it into a centralized, domineering religion in its own
image. Nevertheless, she was never baptized, nor did she ever join
any Christian church.
</P>
<P>
   As a paraphrase of Weil's view, Jeffrey Mehlman of Boston
University said: ``Rome, the incarnation of imperial statism,
ripped Christianity from the spiritual fabric that sustained it and
reinterpreted it spuriously as the heir of the this-worldly
religion of Israel and its God of vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars at the conference felt Weil viewed Hellenic
civilization through rosy spectacles. She explained away the
destruction of Troy, for example, by saying the Greeks never
gloried in it as the Romans did in their annihilation of Carthage.
</P>
<P>
   For Page duBois, a classicist from the University of California
at San Diego, Weil's sense of the purity of ancient Greece was
based on ``selective reading'' that omitted ``the sex and
drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was no agreement on Weil's attitude toward fellow
Jews or the effect of her thinking on contemporary anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Stanislawski, a professor of Jewish history at Columbia,
called her an anti-Semite whose views were an ``unpardonable
perfidy'' to some.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvie Courtine-Denamy, a French philosopher, pointed out that
under the collaborationist Vichy regime of Marshal Petain, Weil
proposed limiting Jewish entry into the French civil service and
sought to encourage Jewish assimilation and mixed marriages.
</P>
<P>
   But Lotringer defended Weil, arguing that assimilation was a way
of shielding France's Jews from persecution by eliminating them as
a separate minority.
</P>
<P>
   The mystical nature of her Christianity led her to welcome
suffering _ which she called ``affliction'' _ believing it brought
the soul closer to God. This, several speakers suggested, may have
diminished her sympathy for Jewish suffering in occupied France.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, her attitude toward Judaism apparently arose from
a conviction that the ancient Israelites were aggressive and cruel;
this caused her to battle oppression _ except, it seems, against
her own people.

`NO ONE EVER TOLD US THAT STUFF COULD KILL YOU' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIBBY, Mont. _ Darlene Joy Riley called her cancer ``George.''
Last year, George killed her.
</P>
<P>
   Before she died at age 52, she questioned why she got asbestos
fibers in her lungs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I wind up with the disease? I didn't work there (at
W.R. Grace's vermiculite mine).''
</P>
<P>
   Darlene _ her friends called her Toni _ was an energetic woman,
almost to the end. Plaques and commendations on her living room
wall testified to how she lived life.
</P>
<P>
   She was a reserve deputy sheriff, worked on the town's ambulance
crew, was a trained rescue diver and helped out fighting forest
fires.
</P>
<P>
   She raised four children.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things on Toni's wall was a certificate showing she
was trained in how to remove asbestos from schools, homes and
businesses in a program sponsored by the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no way to remove it from her lungs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, she noticed she was always short of breath. A year
later, a doctor in Spokane told her that her chest was filled with
mesothelioma, an asbestos-caused cancer of the pleural lining.
</P>
<P>
   Radiation therapy was supposed to give her another couple of
years, but the treatment so weakened her that she had to stop
helping patients at accidents and fires.
</P>
<P>
   After she became very sick, she sued W.R. Grace to get them to
pay for an experimental anti-cancer drug she saw on television. Her
struggle with George can be traced in her own words from a
two-volume deposition she gave in the case.
</P>
<P>
   She went through surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up and I'm cut from here to here and I called my family
and told everybody that I was fine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just die. I mean I can't look at my family and tell
them there is no hope. So I tell them that I'm fine and I beat
George.''
</P>
<P>
   Her old ambulance squad and other friends threw a benefit and
raised $5,000 to pay for drugs, mostly painkillers. Others in her
family were also ill with asbestos-related diseases, she said,
including the man she was married to for 35 years, both her
parents, her sister, three cousins, two uncles and her
brother-in-law, who was a manager for W.R. Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Neither she nor her parents worked at the mine, but she said she
grew up surrounded by the vermiculite ore and dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the wind blew in Libby years ago, there was dust
everywhere. Clothes on the line were white with dust. We used to
write in the dust on the cars,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   She said there weren't any ``no trespassing'' signs on the mine
buildings near the ball fields, between the river and town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We climbed and slid on the piles of vermiculite. We picked up
little pieces and took them apart. The kids would light it and it
would puff up.''
</P>
<P>
   Until she took the EPA asbestos course, she said, she had no
idea that the fibers were dangerous, and only then did she learn
that the Zonolite used for insulation in many of Libby's homes,
including hers, contained tremolite fibers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insulation was falling all over the place,'' Toni said. ``It
was coming out of the ceiling. I'd pull the string to turn on the
light in the laundry room and the stuff would leak to the floor. I
just swept it up and threw it outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever told us that stuff could kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she learned too late, and she worried about others in
town who still didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, she was housebound. Toni listened to the calls on
the ambulance scanner and looked out her front window.
</P>
<P>
   ``The window is important to me, to be able to see the sunshine,
leaves, the snow,'' Toni told her lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Grace made a cash settlement with her a few days before the case
was scheduled for trial, but Toni never got her experimental drug.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, she died.

W.R. GRACE STARTED IN THE BAT GUANO BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. had a not-so-fragrant beginning in 1854.
William R. Grace, who had fled the Irish potato famine to Peru,
chartered ships to trade bat guano and bird droppings.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years later, he moved his headquarters to New York and
set up a worldwide network trading fabric, fertilizer, machinery
and other products.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of World War II, William Grace's grandson, Peter,
took over control of the company and ran it for almost a half
century, until 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company's focus remained on chemicals and
packaging, Peter Grace diversified Grace into everything from
sporting goods to tacos.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1995, Grace divested many of its larger businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Grace for
manipulating earnings in one of its divisions. To settle the suit,
Grace set up a $1 million financial education fund.
</P>
<P>
   Grace has gone through elaborate reorganization in the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers handling the asbestos suits against Grace say the
shuffling was done to conceal assets and cloud the corporate lines
of responsibility. Grace denies the charges and calls the moves
``solid business decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it has downsized, Grace's sales are still about $1.4
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   But like other giant companies that sold asbestos products
during the heyday of the flameproof fiber, Grace is still plagued
by lawsuits filed by people allegedly harmed or killed by the
fibers in the insulation, garden products and other applications it
sold.
</P>
<P>
   More than 250,000 asbestos-related suits have been filed against
Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of them except the 187 involving the miners and the
families from Libby, are personal injury suits dealing with the
hazards of asbestos products, said Jay Hughes, Grace's top
litigation counsel.
</P>
<P>
   About 150,000 suits have been settled or dismissed. An estimated
102,000 cases remain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spotlight was thrown on one of Grace's darkest moments when
the movie ``A Civil Action'' was released in January.
</P>
<P>
   John Travolta and Robert Duvall dramatized the book of the same
name written by Jonathan Harr. The book told the story of families
living in the old New England mill town of Woburn on the outskirts
of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Five Woburn children and one adult died of acute lymphocytic
leukemia from exposure to chemicals in their drinking water. Others
were sickened. Grace and another company were found by the
Environmental Protection Agency to be responsible for dumping the
toxic chemicals that poisoned two of Woburn's wells.
</P>
<P>
   Grace paid $8 million to eight families in return for the
withdrawal of lawsuits they had filed.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Grace was indicted by the Department of Justice on two
counts of lying to the EPA in 1982 about the amount of hazardous
chemicals it used at its Woburn plant. In 1988, Grace pled guilty
to one count and was fined the maximum _ $10,000. Today, the
penalty for that charge is $500,000.

   SPEND-SENATE (Washington) _ The Senate, exhausted by
parliamentary maneuvers and eager to adjourn, prepared to pass the
final budget bill of the year on Friday night. The Senate majority
leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, scheduled a vote Friday night
after a long filibuster by midwestern senators over dairy
legislation evaporated. Senior Republicans, by offering to help the
senators change the way the government regulates milk prices,
cleared the way for a final vote on a $386-billion package of five
spending bills that would all but wrap up Congress' work for the
year. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-FOREIGN-POLICY (Simi, Calif.) _ George W. Bush on Friday
cautioned against retreating to a U.S. foreign policy based on
isolationism and protectionism, calling it a ``shortcut to
disaster'' that would invite challenges to America's power as a
world leader. The result, he said, ``would be a stagnant America
and a savage world.'' (Summary from wires.) By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-DAUGHTER (Washington) _ How Karenna Gore Schiff, a
26-year-old law student and new mom, has become a huge, and hugely
underestimated, force in her father's campaign, an influence
important for what it says about the candidate himself. By Melinda
Henneberger.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   BONFIRE-TRADITION (College Station, Texas) _ For the faithful of
Texas A&AMP;M University, the bonfire is a 90-year tradition that binds
generations of students to one another and to the university.
Students aspire to become Red Pots or Brown Pots, the upperclassmen
who oversee the round-the-clock construction effort. Graduates
often return to relive their college days and help out. But in the
aftermath of this week's fatal campus accident, in which 11
students were killed while building a huge wooden structure for a
traditional Thanksgiving Day football bonfire, some soul-searching
is taking place. By Jim Yardley.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-TALKS (Istanbul, Turkey) _ On the final day of a summit
on European security, President Clinton on Friday joined Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and the leaders of 28 other nations in
signing an agreement limiting conventional weapons in Europe. But
with Chechnya dominating the summit agenda, Clinton said he would
not submit the updated treaty to the Senate until Russia complies
with the new ceilings by reducing its weaponry in and around
Chechnya. By Mark Lacey.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-MEDIATOR (Washington) _ The judge in the Microsoft
antitrust trial appointed a mediator Friday to oversee
``voluntary'' settlement talks between the government and the
software giant. The surprise move dramatically increases chances
for an out-of-court agreement. (Summary from wires) By Steve Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   NY-HOMELESS-VIOLENCE (New York) _ In a renewed effort to crack
down on the homeless following this week's brutal attack on a
27-year-old office worker in Midtown Manhattan, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir announced on Friday
that police officers would begin arresting people who sleep in the
streets. By Elizabeth Bumiller.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   First the scroll, then the codex and the Gutenberg Bible. And
now the electronic book? Almost nothing causes more anxiety in the
publishing world than the idea that books as we know them might one
day be replaced by electronic or e-books. Will paper books, with
their distinctive smell and touch, the special, almost trancelike
intimacy they can engender between writer and reader, vanish
forever? And if so, what will the experience of reading be like in
the 21st century?
</P>
<P>
   Books will still be around, many scholars say, but we may read
in a different way. Only a handful of e-books _ portable devices
with screens designed just for reading _ are available today. Among
those already on the market are the SoftBook, which sells for
around $300 and a commitment of $19.99 a month to buy material for
it, and NuvoMedia's Rocket eBook, advertised at $199. Within six
months, Microsoft plans to begin shipping the Reader, a new program
designed to make the text on a computer screen look as it does in
real books. Unlike the current crop of e-books, Microsoft's Reader
is not a separate device; it is software designed for use on
someone's home or laptop computer. The Reader will be available as
a free-standing program for use with Windows. By giving the program
away or selling it at low cost, Microsoft says, it will stimulate
the manufacture of more e-book devices that the company hopes will
eventually all use the Reader.
</P>
<P>
   But is the act of reading something that needs improving?
Analysts say that existing e-books are selling poorly because
consumers are satisfied with the old-fashioned reading experience.
``People aren't interested,'' said Tom Rhinelander, who analyzes
the electronic book market for Forrester Research Inc., a
Cambridge, Mass., concern that studies computer use. ``The market
went nowhere in a year. The fundamental reason is that people who
read books don't have a problem with books today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The main issue is that if it's not broken, don't replace it,''
Rhinelander said.
</P>
<P>
   Regular books have clearer typefaces than computers, and they
are lighter. And e-books have batteries that make them hot. ``If
you're a consumer, how would you consume this?'' Rhinelander asked.
``You would buy a $300 device and download it and relearn how to
read. If you're a book lover, you're not putting them in a bookcase
and giving them to friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the architect of Microsoft's new Reader program, Bill Hill,
admits: ``People do not like to read on the screen.'' He added,
``It's horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider that some studies have shown that the average person
reads no more than three to five paragraphs of text on a computer
screen before pressing the print button.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, reading results in a change of consciousness, a
total immersion. Indeed, researchers have documented that during
periods of total absorption in reading, there are changes in
respiration and heartbeat. Computers, with their heft and weight,
their lighted screens and distracting icons, interfere with that
experience.
</P>
<P>
   But a new generation of readers weaned on computers, habituated
to receiving information in short takes, may not find it difficult
to acclimatize to e-books.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Darnton, a professor of history at Princeton University
who has championed electronic publishing for scholarly
dissertations, said, ``I think it's only a matter of time before we
can have mechanical devices that will make possible a satisfactory
but new experience of reading.''
</P>
<P>
   But he conceded: ``One thing that seems to be missing is paper,
the feel of a book when you hold it, its grain, its texture, its
elasticity, its whiteness. ``The sensation of paper is bound up in
the experience of reading. We have a long-term kinetic memory of
paper. How will we substitute a new medium for it or improve on
it?''

 UNDATED: on it.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hill said he drew on histories of reading and studies of its
psychology and physiology in developing Microsoft's Reader. ``The
book today is at the apex of millions of years of evolution,'' Hill
said. ``It goes back beyond the printed word and tablets of
stone.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Initially, people read on tablets or scrolls without punctuation
or spacing between the words. Reading was a communal experience,
with texts mostly being read aloud. In the third or fourth century
A.D. came the codex, pages bound at the inner margins, which made
reading easier because the reader could thumb through the text. The
codex formed the prototype for the modern book. Two pages, side by
side, also made it easier for the eye to flow across the text, as
did adding page numbers. As with nearly every new development in
reading, the appearance of the codex brought about social change
and facilitated the spread of Christianity, which was a religion of
the Book.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle Ages, punctuation and word separation came into
use. Possibly some time in the early Middle Ages, reading became a
private experience rather than the communal one of reading aloud.
</P>
<P>
   Gutenberg's printing press and the advent of movable type in the
15th century paved the way for the Reformation, which was a
reaffirmation of Christianity as a religion of the Book, with a
Protestant translation of the Bible required in every church in
England.
</P>
<P>
   After the Reformation, the Enlightenment spread through Europe
by means of the printed word, books and pamphlets, resulting in ``a
secularized world in which print culture is fundamental,'' said
Darnton of Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Of primary importance in the history of the book is the
evolution of typefaces. Books are usually printed in serif type. In
this face, each letter has at least one serif or tiny dash attached
to it, giving the eye a kind of horizontal line to follow across
the page. Many computer texts are printed in sans-serif, blocklike
letters that are harder to read. The text in paper books also has
kerning, a term for printing certain letters closer together, and
ligatures, the blending of two letters into one, both of which ease
the eye's path across the page.
</P>
<P>
   Most new technologies begin by trying to duplicate previous
technologies, said Anthony Grafton, a professor of history at
Princeton. ``Early photographers did what the landscape painters
were already doing. Later, they did things no painter had thought
of. The camera could both duplicate ways of dealing with nature and
create new ones.''
</P>
<P>
   That is in a sense what companies like Microsoft are trying to
do: recreate the experience of reading a printed book.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said the main feature of the Microsoft Reader was its new
display technology ClearType, which is designed to make a computer
screen look like a page in a book, with letters having the same
clarity and resolution as they do on paper. The Reader software
will have a built-in dictionary, and it will enable the consumer to
download hundreds of books into one portable device. As with other
programs, the consumer will be able to write in the margins of the
e-book and save his place, and instead of the text scrolling down
the screen, a new page will appear with the click of a button.
Microsoft, SoftBook and Rocket eBook have also joined to establish
a universal format for all e-books, called the Open eBook standard.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Microsoft's program works best for reading from a
standard LCD screen, the kind found on many laptop computers _ a
substantively different act from reading a paper book. And that's a
real drawback, according to its competitors. ``In the end you're
holding onto this big, hot piece of hardware with a short battery
life,'' said Martin Eberhard, co-founder and chief executive
officer of Nuvomedia, which makes the Rocket eBook. Of course, with
the Rocket eBook and other reading devices, you're still holding a
pricey electronic device with a screen.
</P>
<P>
   Grafton of Princeton says the history of the book shows that one
form doesn't necessarily replace another. Most computers still use
scrolling, just as medieval texts did, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   With e-books, people may learn to read in a whole new way,
Grafton said. Instead of reading being a linear experience as the
reader's eye moves across the printed page, reading may become
``circular,'' with the reader following text from link to link on a
computer screen with the click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   E-books may also become simply an alternate form of reading.
``Many forms of reading exist in any complex society,'' Grafton
said. ``I read my American Express bill differently from the way I
read the text I'm teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reading,'' he added, ``is a complicated, multiple process.''

CLOTHING TAKES ON COLOR AND PIZAZZ

   Glimmer and glitz are everywhere this holiday season, from the
newly designed Waterford Crystal ball high atop Times Square to
fashions head-to-toe. Sparkle and shine predominate.
</P>
<P>
   Store racks are overflowing with brightly colored beaded gowns,
rhinestone-adorned shoes and ``gem''-studded fitted tees.
</P>
<P>
   Though many traditional American designers kept their holiday
collection simple, Italian designers such as Gucci infused the
runways in June with everything from mens baggy streetwear jeans to
women's evening gowns, all festooned with beading of every shape
and color, which have made their way to showroom floors and display
windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most of the '90s, men and women have relied on a
minimalist wardrobe, but fashion will be much more embellished as
we go into the new year,'' said Carolyn Moss, fashion director of
Ready-to-Wear with Macy's department stores in New York. ``I think
it'll have momentum throughout the year and won't end come January
first. There's a trend toward adding glitz to clothes, which have
been simple and plain for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about women who are not ready to fully embrace the
latest craze? ``You can be drop-dead beaded, or use it simply as
trim at the neckline or hemline,'' Moss said. ``If that's too much,
there are always accessories. As much or as little as you feel
comfortable with. Either way, you'll see it most everywhere this
holiday season.''
</P>
<P>
   And what if your party's not quite a black-tie affair?
</P>
<P>
   ``A beaded camisole, delicately trimmed pants or increasingly
popular twin set may be the way to go, and it prevents forsaking
comfort,'' said Sharon Fenno, owner of Circles in Albany, N.Y. Step
inside Fenno's New York-style boutique and you'll see everything
from T-shirts to evening gowns garnished with beading. If your goal
is to look like a million bucks for the millennium, Circles has a
plethora of hand-beaded, hand-painted, uniquely designed evening
dresses. A champagne-colored, floor-length, Kay Unger gown, her
most expensive piece, shows attention to detail, with hand-painted,
deep red roses, almost appearing real, flowing down the strapless
sheath, and the hand-sewn fine traces of iridescent red beads
trailing throughout, costs $589.
</P>
<P>
   You can be festive and break into the trend without breaking the
bank. Circles has
</P>
<P>
   long-sleeved black or white crewneck T-shirts with ``2000''
splashed across the front in crystal-clear rhinestones for $52.
</P>
<P>
   It often takes a celebrity embracing a style for it to really
take off, and as '70s pop icon Cher makes yet another comeback, her
style is once again in demand. Fenno said she knew this
Cher-inspired trend would be popular for the holiday season back in
June, because it highlighted the designers' runway shows in New
York. ``It's the retro look again, motivated greatly by Cher and
her designer, Bob Mackie,'' Fenno said.
</P>
<P>
   Cher as the icon for this trend seems to grace the minds of much
of the fashion industry. ``She had an OK voice, but always looked
fabulous, and I think that's what made her such a success, and
she's back again with as much style and flair as ever before,''
said Jimmy Newcomer, professor of fashion design at the Fashion
Institute of Technology in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gucci may have introduced it this season, but Cher has been
setting fashion trends since the '70s. Back then she was one of the
few decked out in beading, yet today she continues the inclination
and much of the country follows,'' said Vincent Mas, account
executive with fashionmall.com, an on-line fashion information
source and store.

<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ When Dan and Priscilla Sandoval moved into
their sprawling new home in the steep, maple-covered hills here a
few years ago, they bought the usual homeowner's insurance
coverage. But they decided to skip the separate coverage for
earthquakes. Their budget was tight, and they figured the risk was
not that great. Everyone knew that Portland was nothing like San
Francisco and Los Angeles when it came to earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   But this spring, they began having second thoughts. Reports had
begun to circulate that the prevailing wisdom might be wrong, that
new scientific techniques had revealed a much greater chance of a
monster quake. The Sandovals watched as bridges and public
buildings were reinforced.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, they called their State Farm agent to sign up for
earthquake insurance for their brick-trimmed clapboard house. ``It
had been on my mind for a while,'' Mrs. Sandoval said.
</P>
<P>
   The same fast-moving advances in earthquake science that helped
change the Sandovals' minds have also rattled the insurance
industry, which never liked selling earthquake policies anyhow. The
new discoveries, coupled with a string of recent earthquakes, has
given fresh urgency to a nationwide effort by insurers to reassess
just how much the next Big One could hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   In Portland, the insurers' re-evaluation is still in its early
stages. But it has already led to higher prices and substantial
cutbacks in coverage, much as it has where the insurers are farther
along in the process, like California and the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies are finding risk where they didn't know it
existed,'' said Ira Zuckerman, an analyst at Nutmeg Securities in
Westport, Conn., who follows the property and casualty insurance
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers had a similar awakening with hurricane losses along the
Atlantic and Gulf coasts. In many ways, though, earthquakes are in
a category all their own. Hurricanes occur fairly often, are
relatively easy to see coming and strike well-defined areas.
</P>
<P>
   With earthquakes, by contrast, high-risk areas can remain
undisturbed for decades between disasters, no one can predict them
with any precision, and the geography is still only partly
understood, making the threat seem more distant and more abstract.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about their own survival, Zuckerman added, the companies
have been shifting much of the burden of payment for earthquake
damage back to their customers. By far the greatest impact on
customers has come from insurers' shrinking from coverage in subtle
ways: raising deductibles by tens of thousands of dollars, and
curtailing or excluding coverage of furniture, china and other
household contents, living expenses after a disaster and property
like garages, sheds, fences and swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   In almost every earthquake zone, from the Pacific Coast to the
Midwest to portions of South Carolina, the once nearly universal 5
percent deductible has vanished, replaced by minimum deductibles of
10 percent or 15 percent. For a $350,000 home in earthquake-prone
California, a 15 percent deductible, the lowest available, means a
homeowner must absorb $52,500 in damage before the earthquake
policy pays a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Every increase of 5 percent in the deductible is equivalent to a
40 percent rise in a policy's premium. But insurers, like chocolate
makers who shrink the candy bar instead of raising its price,
prefer to raise deductibles and change other policy terms to avoid
sharp premium increases. They know that most policyholders pay
little attention to any aspect of earthquake insurance policies
other than the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Several Portland homeowners who spoke about their coverage
recently said they did not even realize their policies had
deductibles.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear: Nobody likes earthquake insurance as it is
now. Even before this year's wave of reassessments and price
increases, customers said it was too expensive and too limited.
Insurance companies say that losses on the policies are too hard to
predict.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers felt the same way about flood insurance, and in 1968
they were able to get the federal government to take on that
responsibility. In California, they have persuaded the state to
share much of the earthquake burden, but they are on their own
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In Portland, as in most other places in America where
earthquakes are a threat, only about a third of homeowners buy
coverage _ and that's fine with the insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Those who buy coverage do so out of fear: they imagine their
homes in ruins and are thinking total loss. As Julee Felsman, a
Portland mortgage broker, put it, earthquake insurance seems ``a
better deal than being the proud owner of a pile of rubble.''
</P>
<P>
   But insurers are running scared as well, and from several
conflicting fears. One is competitive pressure. Insurers do not
want to sell earthquake policies but do want to sell lucrative
homeowners' and auto policies. So they offer earthquake insurance
to homeowners to keep them as customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insurance companies basically write earthquake insurance
because they feel the market forces them to,'' said Peter Myers, a
senior executive of Safeco Insurance, a leading insurer on the West
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling the other way is a fear of what the insurers call
adverse selection: The people most likely to buy earthquake
insurance are, like the customers for flood insurance, the ones
most likely to suffer damage. Insurers are also concerned that if
they refuse to sell earthquake insurance, state regulators may
force them to.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want the government making your business decisions
for you,'' said Jim Ament, a senior executive at State Farm.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, insurers are terrified of the same thing that
customers are: the Big One, and the prospect of being ruined by it.
The 1994 Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles gave the industry a
rude awakening about its forecasting prowess: Insurers anticipated
perhaps $3 billion in claims from an earthquake like that, but
wound up paying out more than $15 billion for claims on homes and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   One company, the Farmers Insurance Group, which is based in
California, said it paid out three times as much for Northridge as
it had collected in earthquake premiums for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising, then, that insurers find it in their
interest not to make earthquake insurance attractive. ``If all our
homeowners were to have earthquake coverage, it would create a
serious exposure problem for us,'' said Larry D. Johnson, who is in
charge of managing Allstate's risk to natural catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers find many ways to not sell insurance. One sure-fire way
is not to mention it. They exercise their right to reject coverage
on houses they deem too flimsy or that are precariously perched.
And they won't sell if they feel that they have already sold too
much coverage in one area.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard and Paula Klein, who moved to Portland from West New
York, N.J., said they called six companies before Allstate agreed
to insure their $200,000 home on the rim of a deep ravine
overlooking the Willamette Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Where insurers once relied on crude maps and intuition to
forecast risk and losses, they are now spending millions on
computerized research that can calculate a hypothetical
earthquake's impact down to an individual home.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers are filling databases with technical data from
seismologists, geologists and construction engineers as well as
municipal building codes and soil-composition and water-table
studies. High-resolution satellite photographs and Global
Positioning System devices are capturing minute movements along
fault lines.
</P>
<P>
   In combination, the data is used to construct simulations of
various seismic events to see the potential damage. California,
where insurers have the most to lose, got the high-technology
treatment first, then Washington and the Midwest; the insurers and
their consultants turned to Oregon only recently.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with more precise damage estimates, many insurers are
subdividing the states they study into many more pricing zones than
in the past and raising rates in the highest-risk zones while, in
theory, cutting premiums elsewhere. In practice, prices tend to
rise in those areas where the coverage is most needed and decline
or stay the same in less-threatened areas, where people are less
likely to buy the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   From a business standpoint, prices had to be raised. Before the
Northridge earthquake, many insurers had gone for years without
changing prices or updating total exposure estimates while whole
new communities sprang up in earthquake zones.
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from past practices, insurers are basing
earthquake premiums on what may happen rather than on what has
happened in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you buy homeowners insurance or auto insurance, the price
you pay is closely tied to the company's experience on claims,''
said Paul VanderMarck, a senior executive at Risk Management
Solutions, a consulting company in Menlo Park, Calif., that
performs computer studies of earthquakes and hurricanes for
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   But the insurers have found that with big earthquakes and
hurricanes, past performance has not necessarily been an indicator
of future results. ``With autos and homes, there are literally
millions of data points on claims,'' VanderMarck said. ``But over
20 or 25 years you might see one or two earthquakes. Or none. So if
you try to extrapolate from that limited experience, you could be
completely misled.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics worry that the computer models are slanted in the
insurers' favor. In Florida, Bill Nelson, the insurance
commissioner now running for United States senator, has argued that
computer models greatly overprice hurricane coverage. And in
Missouri, the insurance department has challenged computer findings
that prices for earthquake coverage ought to be tripled in areas
closest to the New Madrid Fault, which last produced a major
earthquake in 1811.
</P>
<P>
   The Insurance Services Office, a New York consulting firm that
developed the New Madrid pricing plan, has also proposed one for
Oregon that would raise rates for most Portland homes by 40 percent
and reduce rates sharply in the state's sparsely settled south and
east.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers Insurance, which has the second-largest share of the
homeowners market in Oregon, after State Farm, will introduce its
own plan in December. It will raise rates for most homes west of
the Cascade Mountains, including Portland, by 10 percent, to $77
for each $100,000 of home value. Premiums will be held steady in
the rest of the state and exclusions will be increased sharply
statewide.
</P>
<P>
   As the industry adjusts to the new scientific assessments of the
risk in Oregon, the state may be starting down a contentious road
that California traveled before it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, with few homes insured against earthquake losses, the
California legislature passed a law requiring companies selling
homeowners insurance to offer earthquake coverage. Back then, the
insurers thought that such a law would close a loophole that had
enabled customers to collect on earthquake losses through their
homeowners policy even though they had not paid for earthquake
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Northridge earthquake, many companies threatened
to leave the state rather than comply with the law. So the
legislature authorized a new type of earthquake policy that was
both expensive and exceedingly narrow. It featured 15 percent
minimum deductibles, Draconian limits on coverage for furnishings
and emergency living expenses, and no coverage for anything on the
property but the house.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, insurers began replacing their old, broader
policies with the new ones, greatly reducing their liability. But
they still resisted taking on any new business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the state set up the California Earthquake Authority.
To get insurers to sell the same bare-bones policy to all comers,
the authority placed a relatively low ceiling on potential losses
for the companies and said it would try to cover other losses by
buying reinsurance and floating bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The authority now has access to $7.2 billion to pay claims,
according to Mark Leonard, a spokesman. Though that is less than
half the final outlay in the Northridge quake, Leonard said that
using up the funds was ``an extremely remote possibility,'' largely
because of limitations in the new policies.
</P>
<P>
   The authority estimates that insurers would pay only about $3.43
billion if the Northridge quake occurred today; property owners
would have to absorb the remaining damage $11.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not surprisingly, an increasing number of Californians
are deciding not to bother buying earthquake insurance. Richard
Roth, the chief actuary for the California insurance department,
estimates that about 20 percent of the people in the area hit by
the Northridge earthquake now have earthquake coverage, down from
about 40 percent before the event.
</P>
<P>
   The average cost for the earth quake insurance in California is
$279 a year for a $100,000 house. During the summer, the earthquake
authority began offering additional coverage that has been selling
briskly.
</P>
<P>
   For an average of $185 more for a $100,000 house, a customer can
lower the deductible to 10 percent from 15 percent, increase
coverage on furnishings to $100,000 from $5,000, and raise
emergency living expenses to $15,000 from $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Oregon, where prices are much lower than in California
and most policies still offer broader coverage, homeowners can
think of many other ways to spend their money. A moderate
earthquake of 5.6 magnitude shook Portland just after the Sandovals
moved here from California, doing little damage. Reasoning that it
would probably be a long time before another one came along, they
decided that they could do without the extra insurance.
</P>
<P>
   While scientists believe that a major earthquake would affect a
wide swath of Portland, many residents study maps of danger zones
and try to guess, street by street and house by house, whether
their homes will be wrecked.
</P>
<P>
   Charles and Alida Geoffroy lived in a seven-bedroom house on a
hillside for years without earthquake insurance. But they bought
coverage last month when they moved into a condominium on the edge
of the Willamette River.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house was on a solid piece of granite,'' Mrs. Geoffroy
said. ``Now we're on solid sand. In an earthquake, water mixes in
with sand and it just turns to soup.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a personal fright to get some people to buy quake
coverage. Dr. Lawrence Duckler, a retired surgeon, said he took out
a policy after his daughter broke an arm in the Northridge
earthquake. Barry Buchanan and his wife, Debbie Meisinger, signed
up after the Taiwan earthquake this summer. Buchanan goes to Taiwan
on business.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the Sandovals decided to get a policy last summer,
Sandoval, who owns a Mexican restaurant and is developing an
Internet business, procrastinated. He happened to be in Las Vegas
on business when an earthquake struck close to Joshua Tree in the
nearby California desert _ and the jolt threw him out of his hotel
bed. He called his agent as soon as he got home.

<P>
   When the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rammed a 1999
Mazda Protege into a pole in Virginia early this year, the impact
reached California. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Mazda's North American headquarters in Irvine, officials
scrambled to clean up a public-relations mess. The '99 Protege
suffered $4,609 in damages in four 5 mph crashes _ the worst
showing, by far, of nine vehicles tested. It was also a turnabout;
a '97 Protege had suffered just $1,930 in testing damage.
</P>
<P>
   The problem stemmed from a redesign of the car. To trim about
two pounds, part of a broader effort to reduce weight and improve
mileage, Mazda had eliminated an aluminum bar and energy-absorbing
foam. After the test results became public, Mazda quickly decided
to return to the previous design for 2000-model Proteges. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bumper tests like these can leave consumers scratching their
heads. How can a series of 5 mph impacts cause nearly $5,000 in
damage? Don't federal rules protect consumers' wallets from such
big whacks? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not really, consumer advocates say. The institute's bumper
bashing illustrates the continuation of a decades-long debate about
whether consumers are served or shortchanged by bumper rules.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, the government required that the bumpers of all new
cars meet a 5 mph standard. That meant there could be no damage to
safety-related items (headlights and turn signals) or to exterior
surfaces (the body or sheet metal). It did allow damage to bumpers
and attaching hardware. The standard was later strengthened to
prohibit substantial harm to the bumper, allowing only minor
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Then, during the energy crisis of the '80s, automakers
complained that the heavier bumpers reduced fuel economy. In 1983,
the government relaxed its rules.
</P>
<P>
   Cars must now meet this standard: A 2.5 mph crash cannot damage
safety-related parts or body panels. There can, however, be damage
to the bumper. Lots of damage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You could destroy the bumper,'' said Brian O'Neill, president
of the insurance institute, a lobbying and research group in
Arlington, Va., that is largely financed by the insurance industry.
The institute tests the bumpers of about 25 vehicles a year.
</P>
<P>
   Why should consumers care? After all, the insurance companies
are the ones writing the big checks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers don't realize how much difference a good bumper
makes in terms of what they pay every six months or so to their
favorite institution, the auto insurance companies,'' said Kim
Hazelbaker, senior vice president of the Highway Loss Data
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   That organization, which is also financed by auto insurers,
provides information to help those companies set rates. ``Premiums
are influenced by how frequently collisions occur and how much
money it takes to repair the damage,'' Hazelbaker said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since nearly half of collision claims are for $1,000 or less,
they have a big effect on insurance premiums. And minor damage
almost always involves bumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are low-speed collisions that all too often are
generating high repair bills,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do flimsy bumpers mean that consumers pay higher
premiums, but the deductible comes directly out of the consumer's
pocket. The most common collision deductible is $500, Hazelbaker
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The financial penalty can be even larger for the millions of
people driving rough, tough light trucks, particularly sport
utility vehicles. The current bumper standard _ weak it is _
applies only to passenger cars. There is no standard for light
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people think they are in an invincible Goliath when in
fact their invincible Goliath has an Achilles' heel,'' said
Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Although the damage suffered by the Protege was high, it has
been worse for trucks, including minivans.
</P>
<P>
   The midsize sport utility vehicles tested by the insurance
institute suffered damage from $2,918 (1999 Mercedes ML320) to
$6,282 ('99 Mitsubishi Montero Sport). Four of the six had repair
bills of more than $5,000. Among pickups, the '98 Dodge Dakota had
$3,863 in bumper damage; the '98 Toyota Tacoma had $4,361. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the automakers are failing to design better bumpers, can they
be compelled to do so? The United States Department of
Transportation could impose stricter standards, although it has
declined to do so. That leaves groups like the insurance institute,
which uses the carrot and stick of publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to embarrass the automakers that have bad
bumpers and praise the automakers that have good bumpers,'' O'Neill
said. He said he had seen some improvement.
</P>
<P>
   This may save money for the insurance companies, but O'Neill
says there is also a clear benefit to consumers. ``If you ask a
consumer would you like a car with a bumper that sustains expensive
damage or one that sustains no damage, I think the answer is
clear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, consumer groups say, is that many automakers have
either forgotten, or no longer care about, the original purpose of
bumpers: to take the bumps and lumps and protect the rest of the
vehicle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although auto designers strive to blur the lines between where
the bumper ends and the car begins, O'Neill argues that bumpers
should be distinct and utilitarian, as they were when they first
appeared on automobiles in 1906. (The Wescott touring car was the
first vehicle with standard front and rear bumpers, in 1919.) In
his view, a bumper should be set away from the expensive sheet
metal and lights. It should jut out, making it hard for an impact
to reach the body. It should absorb the energy of a minor
collision.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bumper should bump,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   He cites the 1981 Ford Escort as a standard that manufacturers
should emulate: its bumpers sustained no damage in any of the four
tests. Like the bumpers of many past cars, the Escort's were
mounted to shock absorbers. And they stuck out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it was not one of the prettiest cars on the
road,'' said David Champion, auto testing director at Consumer
Reports magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Style and substance do not have to be incompatible. The chic
Volkswagen New Beetle had damage totaling only $134 from all four
low-speed crashes at the insurance institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beetle is the only car the institute has tested that
begins to compare with the 1981 Ford Escort,'' O'Neill said. &QL;

   MILLION-WON _ (Los Angeles) A 31-year-old tax collector from
Hamden, Conn., reached the peak of pop culture's Mount Everest
Friday as the first contestant to go the distance on ABC's hit quiz
show, ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire,'' and the first American to
win a $1 million on a television game show. The IRS agent wasn't
the only winner Friday. ``Millionaire'' is the television season's
least expected runaway hit, a ratings bonanza for ABC, which is
drawing more viewers than NBC hits ``Friends'' and ``Frasier,''
capturing an average of 23.1 million viewers each night. By Val
Kuklenski (Will move on the ``a'' national and ``e'' entertainment

   WATCHING_WINNERS _ (Los Angeles) There's something about money
that makes even watching someone else win lots of it fascinating,
said the lunchtime crowd outside a Starbuck's cafe Friday. It's
that vicarious celebration of the common man that tunes most of
them into ``So You Want to be a Millionaire,'' the prime-time game
showing drawing one out of every 10 Americans to watch. By Robert

   BUSH-SPEECH _ (Los Angeles) Seeking to overcome his recent image
of unfamiliarity with foreign affairs, Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush on Friday outlined what his foreign policy
would be _ a ``distinctly American internationalism'' that rejects
isolationism. The Texas governor spoke to 500 people at the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Library about 35 miles northwest of Los
Angeles, giving a wide-ranging talk focusing on Europe and Asia and
offering some pointed criticism of the foreign policy of President
Clinton _ in particular the lack of an overall strategy to meet
America's goals. By Rick Orlov (Will move on the ``n'' California

FROM BABIES TO DIGNITARIES, CLINTON CHARM WAS ON DISPLAY IN
TURKEY

  (With EUROPE-TALKS)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ When President Clinton toured the
earthquake-shattered town of Izmit this week, he said that he
wanted to ``do everything we can'' to help survivors. He may have
made one of them rich, although the lucky victim is too young to
understand his good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spotted a 7-month-old baby, who was later identified as
Erkan Isik, as he walked through one of the tent cities where tens
of thousands of homeless survivors have been living since the
earthquake on Aug. 17 that killed more than 17,000 people in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lifted the baby gingerly from his mother's arms and held
him close for nearly a minute. Erkan was transfixed, looking deeply
into the stranger's eyes and seeming especially fascinated by the
president's nose, which he grabbed, petted, pulled and twisted.
</P>
<P>
   The scene has been shown endlessly on Turkish television, and it
has made Erkan a celebrity. Friday the press reported that several
advertising companies and a large diaper manufacturer wanted to
hire him as a model. The money that they are offering will be more
than enough to buy his family a new home anywhere in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legendary ability to connect with people was also on
display at the state dinner that President Suleyman Demirel gave
for him in Ankara. Clinton startled several people in the receiving
line by remembering them from years ago and greeting them by name.
</P>
<P>
   One was Henrik Liljegren, the Swedish ambassador here, who was
his country's ambassador to the United States in the mid-1990s.
Before Liljegren could be officially presented, Clinton recognized
him, grabbed his hand and said excitedly to Demirel, ``You got my
ambassador!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is phenomenal,'' Liljegren said afterward. ``He not
only remembers faces, but you get the feeling that he really
remembers people, thousands of them. Naturally it's very
flattering.''
</P>
<P>
   At the dinner, Clinton paid at least as much attention to his
food as to his guests. He seemed especially taken by the chestnut
parfait served for dessert, and he even ate the tiny Turkish and
American flags that, although made of dough, had been placed on the
parfait as decorations.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton reveled in the public adulation that followed him
wherever he went in Turkey, he did not entirely forget politics
back home. At one event, he introduced Howard Baker and Nancy
Kassebaum, two former U.S. senators who are married to each other,
and said, ``In my attempt to fulfill the last ambition of my life,
I'm trying to follow in the footsteps of Senator Howard Baker and
become the husband of a U.S. senator.''
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting here of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, 33,000 police officers were assigned to
guard the 6,500 diplomats, journalists and other participants.
There were a few scuffles, one of which led the Reuters news agency
to distribute a report with a headline that has already become a
local classic: ``Clinton Urges Turkey Free Speech; Protesters
Beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the meeting was in wretched weather. Rain pelted down
and winds howled along the Bosporus as workers prepared a red
carpet for the more than 50 presidents and prime ministers who were
to gather outside a former sultan's palace for their ``family
picture.'' Reporters aboard a boat tied up nearby turned queasy as
waves shook their vessel and salt spray spattered them.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after a gust nearly whipped away the carpet, a
supervisor gave in to the inevitable and ordered that the photo
session move indoors.
</P>
<P>
   The weather also made Clinton miss his planned boat ride on the
Bosporus, a highlight for many visitors to Istanbul. He was to have
boarded a yacht for the signing of landmark accords concerning new
oil pipelines from the Caspian Sea, but the trip was canceled
because the water was too rough.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the adage about politics making strange bedfellows,
one leader with whom Clinton signed the pipeline accord was
President Saparmurat Niyazov of Turkmenistan, whose country has
enormous reserves of natural gas but whose political style is as
far from democracy as almost any on earth. Niyazov, who has made
himself the center of an extraordinary personality cult, attracted
much comment because of two enormous rings he wore, one of which
was crowned with a diamond nearly as large as a golf ball.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most forlorn figure at the summit was Hajj Salih
Brandt, whose business card identifies him as Chechnya's ``special
envoy to Europe.'' Having failed in his efforts to be accredited,
he haunted hotel lobbies, buttonholing delegates and anyone else he
could find to plead the Chechen cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me I couldn't be accredited as part of a government,
because Chechnya has no government,'' Brandt said. ``But when I
tried to get a credential as representing a nongovernmental
organization, they said that was impossible because I was part of a
regime. So Chechnya is being represented here by Russia, which is a
bit strange, to say the least.''

A SURPRISING QUAKE ZONE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JUDITH BERCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ This wasn't supposed to be earthquake country.
Floods, landslides, even the occasional volcanic eruption, perhaps.
But there has not been a major quake in the Pacific Northwest since
European settlers first arrived here, so few people in Oregon,
Washington or British Columbia ever worried about the ground
shaking.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists now believe that the potential makings of a giant
earthquake _ of 8 or 9 magnitude _ have been quietly building here.
Using new data from Global Positioning System satellites,
oceanographers from Oregon State University who were studying
minute movements in the earth's crust found to their surprise that
the Juan de Fuca Plate, a section under the Pacific Ocean, is
moving northeast and shoving under the North American mainland much
faster than was previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, rather than passing smoothly, the two plates are snagged
somewhere, probably under the Coastal Range west of Portland,
leading to growing pressure that can be relieved only by an
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The affected region extends 750 miles, from British Columbia to
northern California, and inland to the Cascade Mountains east of
Portland and Seattle, where the same geological forces have created
active volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary data shows that the Juan de Fuca Plate, once thought
to be almost motionless, may be moving 10 to 15 millimeters a year
_ ``about as fast as your fingernail grows,'' said Chris
Goldfinger, assistant professor of oceanography at Oregon State and
a co-author of a report presented at the Seismological Society of
America meeting in Seattle last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very, very fast, geologically,'' he said. Because of
the motion, he added, ``the North American plate is being
compressed like a spring.''
</P>
<P>
   When the spring finally breaks free of the snag, the region will
suffer a subduction-zone earthquake, a more potentially destructive
type than California usually experiences. Most quakes there occur
along faults where the ground moves laterally, and severe damage is
fairly localized. Subduction-zone quakes affect wider areas and can
be much stronger, like the 9.2-magnitude quake that struck Alaska
in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The last major earthquake in the Cascade region occurred in
1700, and the average interval between such quakes seems to be
about 600 years, but could be less, Goldfinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Other research has found that small crustal faults in the
Portland hills, thought to be inactive, may be able to produce
significant quakes.
</P>
<P>
   Reactions to these alarming reports have varied from fatalism to
urgent concern. Demand for residential earthquake insurance has
picked up somewhat, though not explosively. And some homeowners,
including Portland's mayor, Vera Katz, have made alterations to
their homes to make them safer in a quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our community is in a denial stage, yet they are
informed,'' Mayor Katz said. ``One of the first questions I asked
as mayor was about the potential of an earthquake. There was a
deadly silence in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of downtown Portland was built using methods and materials,
like brick and terra cotta, that often fare poorly in earthquakes.
The city government has begun a program to retrofit public
buildings and bridges and to improve emergency plans.
</P>
<P>
   The state's urban building codes took little account of
earthquake risk until a moderate 5.6-magnitude temblor near Salem,
the state capital, did $30 million in damage in 1993. Since then,
the codes have been tightened somewhat, but they are still less
strict than those in coastal areas or in quake-prone California,
and apply only to new construction, not existing buildings. State
officials say they need more data from the latest studies before
taking new action.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Oregon legislature has been reluctant to
appropriate money for seismic upgrades of the state's highways and
bridges or for new maps of earthquake hazard zones.
</P>
<P>
   Without actual experience of a quake to go by, officials have
trouble deciding how much preparation is needed. ``I'm so
ambivalent about this,'' Mayor Katz said. ``If it's a very severe
quake, I don't know if we've planned far enough. I don't know if
any community can plan far enough.''

<P>
   ST. CROIX, Virgin Islands _ A weakened tropical storm Lenny
finally lurched toward the open Atlantic Friday after punishing the
northeastern Caribbean with two days of relentless winds and
massive ocean waves.
</P>
<P>
   While power was already being restored to parts of St. Croix,
where the destruction was surprisingly light, the Leeward Islands
of Anguilla, St. Maarten, Saba, St. Eustatius, St. Barthelemy, St.
Kitts, Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda were punished for about 36 hours
as Lenny simply spun in place.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m. EST, Lenny was located at near latitude 17.5 north and
longitude 62.2 west, its ill-defined center about 25 miles
west-southwest of Barbuda. Lenny was a hurricane most of the day
Friday before diminishing to tropical storm status with 70-mph
winds later in the day. Lenny also dropped up to 15 inches of rain
over several of the hardest-hit islands.
</P>
<P>
   The late-season storm was blamed for at least eight deaths in
the Caribbean and as far away as coastal Colombia, where torrential
rain and pounding ocean swells killed two men and left hundreds
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   But there was at least one remarkable story of survival, as a
man whose sailboat was swamped by Lenny somehow lived after
spending more than 24 hours in his emergency raft in the
storm-tossed sea.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter from Puerto Rico rescued the man
Friday morning. Officials said he survived 30-foot swells and
100-mph winds in the raft, which capsized repeatedly. His companion
was still missing.
</P>
<P>
   The man _ a resident of French St. Martin whose name was not
released _ was flown to a hospital on St. Croix where he was in
stable condition. Calls to St. Croix hospital, however, could turn
up no information on him.
</P>
<P>
   Two other men were reported still missing from another sailboat,
and Coast Guard searches found no traces of them.
</P>
<P>
   Other fatalities included two people struck by flying debris on
tiny Dutch St. Maarten and a man killed there when a hillside road
on which he was driving collapsed. One man was killed in Puerto
Rico when he fell boarding up his windows. Two people were missing
on Dominica and were feared dead, while another was killed on
Martinique, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the battered islands emerged from shelters and
boarded-up homes Friday to survey the storm's destruction.

<P>
   The British island of Anguilla reported coastal flooding, but no
injuries. Waves destroyed at least four homes on St. Kitts and
Nevis, while the airport tower was damaged on Saba.
</P>
<P>
   On St. Maarten, dozens of homes were without roofs and knee-high
floodwaters covered streets in Philipsburg, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny stunned the Caribbean with its late arrival, coming just
two weeks before the end of hurricane season on Nov. 30. The storm
followed an unusual west-to-east course, which meant heavy damage
on some islands where development is concentrated on the west
coasts. Most hurricanes approach from the east, out of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny swept past St. Croix on Wednesday with 150-mph winds,
putting it just shy of Category 5 _ the most destructive on the
five-step scale of hurricane classification.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the storm's eye came within 20 or 30 miles of
the resort island's south coast, residents and the local government
said damage was relatively minor, far less than other recent
storms, including Hugo in 1989 and Marilyn in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   St. Croix's western tip and the town of Frederiksted were among
the hardest hit. Crews there were busy cleaning up Friday, scooping
up sand tossed by Lenny's waves along Strand Street, the waterfront
avenue in the historic village.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it?'' asked Joyce Frances, an islander who came to see
the destruction. ``This is the destruction everybody's talking
about? This is supposed to be the worst of it, and all we're seeing
is a little bit of sand in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Frances lives in the central part of the island, about 10 miles
from the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``My house is fine,'' she said. ``We didn't even get a single
drop of water inside. Our fruit trees were blown down and are lying
all over the place, but that's it. There's no comparison between
Lenny and Hugo.''
</P>
<P>
   Island businesses _ especially resort hotels and restaurants _
were hoping word of the minimal damage would reach the mainland.
The lucrative winter tourist season is just starting, and
businesses depend on the influx of visitors for most of their
yearly revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people calling from all over, and they think from
watching television that we were wiped out,'' said Nancy Cotter,
owner of the Blue Moon restaurant, one of Frederiksted's most
popular spots. ``But we're cleaning up fast. We'll re-open as soon
as we get power back on.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotter's restaurant faces the ocean on Strand Street, and Lenny
deposited about a foot of water and muck inside. But Cotter had
already cleaned it out by Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Frederiksted's cruise ship pier suffered some damage, and it was
unclear how soon it would be re-opened to the giant ships that
bring thousands of visitors to the island each week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting a really awesome season, but now I'm
worried,'' Cotter said. ``People don't know how fast we can clean
up. Pretty soon you'll never know we even had a hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Roads across St. Croix were open, although most traffic lights
were not operating because electricity had only been restored in a
few places. A drive along the south shore showed a few fallen tree
limbs across part of a lane of traffic, although crews were quickly
cleaning the branches away.
</P>
<P>
   A small number of utility poles were downed or leaning, but most
appeared intact. Telephones were working in most parts of the
island, and stores and gas stations _ some running on generators _
were open and doing a thriving business.
</P>
<P>
   Most hotels reported only minor beach erosion and water damage,
and most were expected to be ready for guests soon. One of the
island's oldest and most popular resorts, the Buccaneer, was up and
running Friday, and was filled with guests, many of them federal
emergency relief workers.
</P>
<P>
   The island's airport re-opened to commercial traffic Friday,
allowing hundreds of worried residents who had been away to return.
The airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico _ a major hub for commuter
airlines serving the region _ was swamped with passengers trying to
get back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started this journey Tuesday,'' yelled one frustrated man
after he was told there were no seats left on a flight for which he
held a ticket. ``Why did you sell me a ticket if there wasn't a
seat?''

OUSTED PAKISTANI PREMIER IS TAKEN BEFORE ANTI-TERRORIST COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The ousted prime minister of Pakistan, Nawaz
Sharif, appeared in public Friday for the first time in five weeks
and told a judge that he was not guilty of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing haggard, Sharif, who reportedly complained that he had
been kept in solitary confinement by the new military government,
was taken into a courthouse in Karachi by a knot of heavily armed
paramilitary troops. He had been taken through the streets in an
armored personnel carrier as part of a long caravan.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was a hearing in an anti-terrorist court, a site
that he had introduced to administer speedy justice to criminals
against the state.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings were brief, and Judge Rehmat Hussain Jafri
returned Sharif to custody, giving prosecutors until next Friday to
present official charges that would let a trial begin. According to
a complaint filed last week, Sharif is accused of hijacking,
kidnapping and conspiracy to murder for having ordered air-traffic
controllers to bar the landing of a plane that was carrying the
army chief of staff. Sharif could face the death penalty if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not conspire in a hijacking,'' he was quoted as having
said. ``Hijacking is done at gunpoint. In this case, the whole
democratic process has been hijacked.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the army chief who ousted Sharif and is
now Pakistan's ``chief executive,'' pledged that the case would be
tried in a ``fair and transparent'' way. But the press was denied
access to the courtroom. Guards beat up some journalists, and
others were threatened with weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's statements in court were recounted after the hearing by
his lawyers and others who had been inside. The lawyers had not
been permitted to see their client beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   ```What is happening today, has the trial started?''' Sharif
asked, according to a lawyer, Nihal Hashmi.
</P>
<P>
   Another lawyer, Iqbal Radh, said he had repeated to the judge
statements that Sharif had told him. ```I was kept in a small room
in Rawalpindi in solitary confinement,''' Radh quoted Sharif as
having complained. ```Some gentlemen came to me and questioned me.
I stayed in Rawalpindi and then was shifted to Muree in cold
weather and remained there in a small room without any facilities.
I could not read newspapers.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rawalpindi, next to the capital, Islamabad, is the home of the
army headquarters. Muree is a nearby hill station.
</P>
<P>
   Another observer quoted Sharif as havign said, ```They did not
torture me physically, but they did everything else.''' Asked
whether he expected a fair trial, Sharif reportedly answered,
``Time will tell if I get justice or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, a millionaire industrialist often accused of corruption,
was removed from power by the military Oct. 12, hours after he had
dismissed his hand-picked army commander, Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint against Sharif, filed Nov. 10 by an army officer,
tells an account that by now is well known to virtually all of
Pakistan's 150 million people. Unaware that he had been ousted,
Musharraf was returning to Pakistan from Sri Lanka on a commercial
flight. Air-traffic controllers, reportedly under Sharif's orders,
refused to allow the plane to land as scheduled in Karachi.
Vehicles blocked the landing strips. Runway lights were turned off.
The airliner, nearly out of fuel, was finally able to land only
after army officers loyal to Musharraf had seized the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The rules in the anti-terrorist courts are made for haste. With
some exceptions, trials are limited to seven days. They can begin
almost immediately after official charges have been filed,
sometimes simultaneously with the questioning of witnesses by
investigators.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sharif, who became prime minister for the second time in
February 1997, frequently made an issue of the need for quicker
justice. Last year, he even let military judges try civilians, a
move that the Supreme Court eventually declared illegal, although
after several of the accused civilians had been swiftly executed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, such fleet proceedings would seem to be working against
Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole case is phony and baseless and one sided, and it
will come apart if a proper defense is allowed to be provided,''
said Raja Zafar-ul-Haq, who was Sharif's religion minister. ``But
these are strange times in Pakistan.''

   The holidays are upon us, which means you'll soon be facing
mobbed shopping centers, hordes of noisy relatives and a glut of
meaningless college football games.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling a sudden urge to wall yourself off from the insanity?
</P>
<P>
   Then join ranks with the wretched-but-noble barricade builders
of  &UR; ``Les Miserables,''  &LR; the stirring musical adaptation of Victor
Hugo's classic novel by Alain Boubilil and Claude-Michel Schonberg.
The touring production of the international mega-hit, which arrives
Dec. 12 at the Ahmanson Theatre, promises to be the most lavish
version L.A. has seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer a less tempestuous cup of seasonal cheer, then
drink in Theatre West's new musical version of  &UR; ``A Christmas
Carol'' &LR;  (Nov. 24-Jan. 9). Entertainer/composer/Renaissance man
Steve Allen supplies the songs for Tiny Tim and company.
</P>
<P>
   Songs aren't included in A Noise Within's production of
 &UR; ``A Christmas Carol,'' &LR;  which runs Dec. 10-19 at Cal State L.A.'s
Luckman Fine Arts Complex, but the acting in this company is
typically so good it may send you out the door humming the
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists for whom December isn't complete without
 &UR; ``The Nutcracker''  &LR; can get their annual Tchaikovsky fix Dec. 4 and
5. The beloved ballet will be performed by Festival Ballet Theater
with the University Symphony Orchestra at the Richard and Karen
Carpenter Performing Arts Center in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   If you dream of spending the holidays overseas, you can visit
Paris without ever leaving the Mark Taper Forum. That's where Neil
Simon's  &UR; ``The Dinner Party'' &LR;  is having its world premiere Dec.
2-Jan. 16. Everyone's being tight-lipped about the plot, but the
ensemble cast includes Frances Conroy, Veanne Cox, Edward Herrmann,
John Ritter, Rita Wilson and Henry Winkler. And here's a twist: All
six play French characters _ which tells you the play has something
to do with food and sex.

 &HT;    VIOLENT ANTI-U.S. PROTESTS GREET CLINTON IN GREECE, PROTESTERS
KEPT AT BAY
 &HT;    (750&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ President Clinton arrived here Friday night under
extraordinary security, as thousands of demonstrators hurled
firebombs, smashed windows and ran riot through downtown Athens to
protest his visit.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadow of the Acropolis, sirens wailed and helmeted
police bearing hand-held body shields fired tear gas to press back
an estimated 10,000 demonstrators as they closed in near the seat
of the Greek Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Retreating protesters smashed scores of shop windows, firebombed
more than a dozen banks and set fire to kiosks and trash cans,
cutting a mile-long swath of destruction through a fashionable
shopping district.
</P>
<P>
   Police reported minor injuries, no deaths and scattered arrests
from the worst violence of any of Clinton's overseas trips..
</P>
<P>
   Several blocks away, Clinton was kept far from the mayhem by a
massive corps of police and troops. They cast a tight security net
along the route his motorcade took into the city from the Ellinikon
International Airport. A phalanx of forces sealed off the
Presidential Palace, where he was hosted by Greek President
Konstandinos Stephanopoulos for a state dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators expressed anger over a litany of U.S. policies and
actions, including:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  U.S.-led air strikes against Serbia, which has close
historical and cultural links to Greece;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  continuing U.S. containment of Iraq, enforced with almost
daily combat air patrols over the oil-rich country and frequent
attacks on Iraqi targets;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  a Cyprus policy that many Greeks regard as pro-Turkey;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and a long history of American political and influence many
here regard as excessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love American people,'' said a young law student in black
jeans named Eve. ``But we don't like your politics.''
</P>
<P>
   In a striking electronic tale of two cities, Greek newscasts
showed split-screen coverage of Clinton's formal arrival juxtaposed
against scenes of pandemonium in the streets nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to experiencing that wonderful quality of Greek
hospitality known to all the world as phyloxenia,'' Clinton said
upon his arrival at Ellinikon International. ``I want the American
people to see the changing face of Greece.''
</P>
<P>
   In the streets, though, was the face of rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious why we hate Clinton,'' said the young law
student, choking back a vile mix of smoke and tear gas. ``He gives
orders to kill people all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other demonstrators who spoke to American reporters, she
refused to give her full name.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton was kept far from the demonstrators, he was also
expecting them. He was forced to scrub a planned three-day trip
here last weekend due to anti-American demonstrations and violence.
His 24-hour visit, ending Saturday afternoon when he flies to
Florence, Italy, is a scaled-down substitute.
</P>
<P>
   In a state visit meant to shore up U.S. relations with a NATO
ally and economic partner along Europe's volatile southeastern
edge, Clinton sought to turn adversity to advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's wife, Hillary, their daughter, Chelsea, and Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright all were presented with bouquets of
flowers as they walked down the red carpet from Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   At the state dinner with President Stephanopoulos, Clinton said
Greece and the United States ``have forged a profound and enduring
friendship'' over the last 180 years.
</P>
<P>
   He tipped his hat to the ``long tradition of impassioned
political debate,'' in a country that developed a working democracy
six centuries before the birth of Christ. And he highlighted the
commitment to freedom of expression common to the United States and
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in all friendships, we have not always agreed, but we have
never broken ranks, because of our shared devotion to democracy and
freedom,'' Clinton said at the state dinner. ``If some engage us in
passionate debate, it is well to remember how hard both our
countries have fought for their right to do just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed at the media attention the protests stripped from
the substance of Clinton's state visit, a representative of the
Greek government visited a hotel where the traveling White House
press corps was holed up to say the demonstrators were not fully
representative of this country of 11.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is of enormous significance that an American president has
chosen to come to Greece,'' said Alex Rondos, an adviser to the
Greek foreign minister, Yeoryios Papandreou. ``If a few wish to
turn their backs on the president of the United States, I think
they're a distinctive, very, very small minority.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear, also, that Rondos was concerned about the image
the protests convey of a country hard at work trying to take its
place as the economic anchor of the southern Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a country which now is investing heavily on the stock
exchange, is moving to a free market, is liberalizing its economy,
is galloping into Europe,'' said Rondos. ``So, the few people who
still hold some strong ideological views, that's part of our
history.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Another part has been U.S. support for a military junta that
overthrew the Greek government in 1967, ushering in seven years of
harsh political repression under the thumb of successive dictators.
</P>
<P>
   That was near the height of the Cold War and Greece had a
vibrant communist movement, remnants of which still survive
alongside a deep suspicion of U.S. motives in general and Clinton's
trip here in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``His visit symbolizes for us the U.S. domination over Greece,
from the '70s until today,'' said a 40-year-old civil engineer
named Petridis. ``It also symbolizes the U.S. aggression against
other peoples, like Yugoslavia or in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   As a NATO member, Greece reluctantly went along with the
U.S.-led air campaign against Yugoslavia's Serbs last spring. Polls
showed, though, that some 96 percent of Greeks opposed the strikes,
and nightly anti-war protests in Athens swelled to a million
demonstrators during the 78-day campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Still others voiced outrage over the security sweep that shut
down much of Athens to protect Clinton and his entourage of several
hundred aides and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   With miles of streets and sidewalks cordoned off, much of this
picturesque city by the Aegean looked like a ghost town, its open
air restaurants and seaside cafes deserted on a warm moonlit Friday
night.
</P>
<P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Eli Yishai and his seven siblings, the children of
Tunisian immigrants, grew up in a lively if crowded one-room flat
in a run-down Jerusalem neighborhood. His family so typified the
working poor that in the late 1960s it was featured in a newspaper
expose of Israeli poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Now Yishai, 37, heads both the Israeli government ministry that
takes care of the poor and the political party, Shas, that
represents the social underclass.
</P>
<P>
   A yeshiva boy from the slums, neither a high school graduate nor
a rabbi, he is not only the youngest member of Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's cabinet but also one of the most powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Since the government took office in July, Shas has rocked the
boat with pledges to abandon Barak's coalition and bring it down.
In recent weeks Yishai in particular has been flexing his muscles,
making it clear that his party's support for Barak's peace efforts
was directly linked to government financial support for Shas'
debt-ridden religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``On behalf of the children, I hope the prime minister will make
the right decision,'' Yishai said in an interview, his voice so
gentle that it clashed with his threats. ``Otherwise his government
will go into a vertigo, an upheaval. And what will come at the end
of such a calamity? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Shas caused a commotion in parliament last week by joining with
the opposition to defeat a string of government initiatives. ``We
paralyzed the parliament!'' Shas' spokesman, Yitzhak Suderi, said,
clearly marveling at the party's power.
</P>
<P>
   And in the last few days, after new statistics revealed record
unemployment and a growing gap between rich and poor, Yishai's
jousting with Barak about how to deal with poverty highlighted the
delicacy of their interdependent relationship.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, in Turkey, Barak was forced to take time out from
his diplomatic schedule to deny that he had insulted Yishai, as a
morning newspaper reported. Barak, who is not known to use crass
language or to attack fellow politicians, told reporters that he
had never, as quoted, called the Shas leader a ``wicked man'' who
should get off his behind ``and work.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Shas is an ultra-Orthodox Sephardic political party,
representing Jewish immigrants from North Africa and the Middle
East. While its leadership is religious, many of its supporters are
drawn to the party for its social platform as a sometime radical
defender of the downtrodden against the Ashkenazic, or Eastern
European-descended, elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shas was born from a scream,'' said Suderi, the party
spokesman. ``It was a scream against the system in which the
Ashkenazim were the rulers and the Sephardim were the black slaves.
Eli Yishai is the symbol of Shas. He's the slave who revolted. He's
exactly the opposite of what the system designated him to be.''
</P>
<P>
   In his office at the Labor and Social Welfare Ministry, Yishai
combed his beard quickly before an interview began and then worked
the phones between questions.
</P>
<P>
   Behind him, the wall hangings make his allegiances clear. The
traditional photographs of the prime minister and President Ezer
Weizman were on display. But they are dwarfed by a huge, lifelike
oil painting of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Shas' spiritual leader, and
other rabbinical portraits, one of them three-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
   Yosef picked Yishai to succeed Aryeh Deri, the rabbi's
charismatic protege, who was convicted of corruption in the spring.
But it is the political embrace that Barak has offered that could
help transform Yishai, a novice, into a genuine leader.
</P>
<P>
   On a personal level, Barak said in an interview that he was
``highly impressed'' by Yishai. Yishai said Barak was a ``very
smart, very talented guy'' with whom he had an ``excellent''
relationship. On a political and sociological level, the bond is
more complex.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Deri, whose appeal is pending, is a tough act to follow. He
stepped down only after leading Shas to an overwhelming success in
the May elections. To many Israelis, he had become a symbol of
corruption, religious hypocrisy and disregard for Israel's secular
legal system.
</P>
<P>
   But many Sephardim saw Deri as a victim of an elitist system
that wanted to take down a Moroccan-born success story. Turning out
en masse, they catapulted Shas from 10 seats to 17 seats in
parliament, making it into a third party that genuinely rivaled the
traditional two big parties, Likud, with 19 seats, and Labor/One
Israel, with 26.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although a newspaper poll recently named him the fourth-sexiest
man in Israel, Yishai is a very low-key successor to an idolized
leader. (He will also be a temporary one if Deri wins his appeal.)
</P>
<P>
   Inside his community, although he served as a minister in the
last government, too, he has only a modest following. Outside he is
both handicapped by Shas' tainted reputation and frustrated by the
fact that he does not have the political capital that Deri amassed
over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But Yishai is determined to assert himself on both fronts at
once _ to stand up for Shas by playing sectarian politics the
old-fashioned way and to change Shas' image as an angry and corrupt
party that seeks to undermine Israeli democracy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Guided by Yosef's rulings, Shas' leadership is considered
dovish, but its constituency is more instinctively ambivalent about
the peace effort with the Palestinians. To bolster support for his
ambitious peace plans, Barak took Shas into his broad-based
coalition, deeply disappointing many of his secular supporters, who
cried ``No Shas!'' on the night of his victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not agree with many of my voters on this,'' Barak said
in a recent interview. ``In Shas, they are basically good people in
terms of what Jewish religion might mean. They are the softer kind.
They take it in a way that it should be adapted to real lives. It's
warm. They try to convince people rather than to impose something.
We have a saying in Hebrew that the Bible has a mild way, that all
its tracts are peaceful, which is not exactly the case with certain
ultra-Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to nurture a sense of a common denominator of
tolerance,'' he continued. ``And since we have a tough, very tough
mission, which will include inevitable painful disputes, we need to
try to keep the social fabric together.''
</P>
<P>
   He also needs to keep a majority together. If Barak's coalition
lost Shas, it would be a minority government, forced to turn to
small parties, to Arab parties or to the right-wing Likud to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Yishai blames Barak's leftist ministers for the party's
problems, chiefly Yossi Sarid, the education minister. From the
start, Sarid has attacked the debt-ridden religious school system
that is the party's flagship. He has withheld funds, citing
financial irregularities and mismanagement, and demanded both a
financial recovery plan and the dismissal of the superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   After threats to leave the coalition did not make the education
ministry's demands disappear, Yishai and Yosef dismissed the
superintendent and cobbled together a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minister can't talk about the corruption because there are
sensitivities,'' said a senior Shas official. ``But he's making
very important changes. He's cleaning out the stables. Not just in
the school system. He's assigning external auditors, internal
comptrollers and legal advisers to every organization. Every shekel
will be accounted for.''
</P>
<P>
   Some funds were released, but new problems arose and the
financial wrangling between Shas and the government is expected to
continue, dragging the political system along with it.
</P>
<P>
   In the push and pull between Barak and Yishai, each has wagered
that the other needed him and so would give a little. So far both
have been right. This week, as their dispute came to a head with
the release of the poverty statistics, they were still professing
that their relationship was intact.
</P>
<P>
   But even Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader was concerned.
Last week, after Shas spent a day voting with the opposition to
show its strength, Ariel Sharon, the opposition leader, paid a
well-photographed visit to Yosef.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli columnist, Dan Margalit, wrote this week that after
seeing the pictures, Arafat asked Barak a question: ``What's
happening with Shas?''

 &HT;    JUDGE NAMES MEDIATOR IN MICROSOFT ANTITRUST CASE
 &HT;    Moving in Washington (w) and financial (f) categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a bold move to jump start a deal between
Microsoft Corp. and the government in their historic antitrust
struggle, the federal judge presiding over the trial Friday named a
fellow jurist to serve as an outside mediator.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides quickly welcomed the surprise ``voluntary'' entry of
Richard Posner, the highly respected chief judge for the 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, into the case.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who two weeks
ago issued a 207-page stinging rebuke to Microsoft, left the next
move up to Posner to schedule further settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been clear that Microsoft and the Justice Department
remain deeply divided over crucial issues, including what sanctions
the company should suffer should it be found guilty of breaking the
nation's antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Posner's work in the coming months will be further complicated
by the fact that 19 state attorneys general have full parties in
the case. At least in theory, any one of the states has the full
legal right to balk at a proposed deal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Posner, as a formidable figure in both judicial and
literary circles, may be able to find a formula that both Microsoft
chairman Bill Gates and the prosecutors can abide. Such a bargain
would avoid a lengthy and costly appeals process. It could also
skirt the possibility of forever branding Microsoft as an abusive
monopolist, as Jackson did in his preliminary opinion. That would
leave the company vulnerable to widespread civil litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is essentially a very positive step toward a
possible resolution of the case,'' said Microsoft spokesman Mark
Murray. ``We're looking forward to working with Judge Posner to try
to reach a fair and reasonable solution.''
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokeswoman proved equally upbeat over the
unexpected turn in the case triggered by Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Posner is a highly respected jurist,'' said Gina
Talamona. ``We look forward to meeting with him to discuss ways to
address the serious competitive problems identified in the court's
findings of fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department has always been willing to seek a settlement
that would promote competition, innovation and consumer choice,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Several legal experts noted that it was highly unusual, if not
altogether unprecedented, to bring an outside mediator into a
high-profile civil antitrust case at a sensitive stage in the trial
proceedings. On the other hand, Jackson has made no secret of his
desire for a deal, lest the courts be burdened for many years
supervising Microsoft's behavior, as occurred when the Bell
System's regulated monopoly was broken up in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the federal bench, Posner served as a professor
at the University of Chicago Law School. He is a prolific author of
legal articles and book reviews, having written about everything
from sex to the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In ``An Affair of State,'' published last month, Posner
concluded that the president obstructed justice and reckons that
offenses comparable to Clinton's would bring a prison sentence of
between 30 and 37 months. Nevertheless, Posner argued that Clinton
should not have been removed from office because, as important as
constitutional self-government may be, it is ``not quite as
important as beating back the ever-present threat of sexual
puritanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in a further effort to spur a deal brokered by Posner,
Jackson left in place a trial schedule that would lead to a ruling
by March or April.
</P>
<P>
   The case is still set to continue with oral arguments on Feb. 22
over how the legal issues apply to the findings of fact.

GORE'S DAUGHTER EMERGES AS A KEY STRATEGIST AND ADVISER IN HIS
CAMPAIGN

 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The hotel room was packed with the nation's leading
smart guys, all offering Sen. Al Gore advice on both domestic and
foreign policy in preparation for his campaign for the 1988
Democratic presidential nomination. In the corner, 15-year-old
Karenna Gore periodically looked up from her homework. ``Dad, I
don't think that's right,'' she interjected at several points.
</P>
<P>
   Now a 26-year-old law student and new mother, Karenna Gore
Schiff is still contradicting the experts. And has become a huge,
and hugely underestimated, force in her father's current
presidential quest. She was instrumental in his recent decision to
move his campaign headquarters to Nashville and convinced him to
change the format of his campaign stops, turning them into the
``town meetings'' she remembered as having worked well for him in
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Along with her friend, feminist writer Naomi Wolf, Ms. Schiff
successfully persuaded her father at the outset of his campaign
that his first order of business should be to distance himself from
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the extent, the effect, even the quality of Ms. Schiff's
influence is most important for what it says about the candidate
himself. And while past and present Gore aides offer mixed reviews
on her advice, they agree about what her role in the campaign
means.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image is, he has all these handlers and advisers and
consultants; but he really relies on his family,'' said Donna
Brazile, the Gore campaign manager. ``They have an enormous
influence on him.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, the vice president agreed. ``That's
always been the case,'' he said. ``Especially Tipper and Karenna,
and as the others get older, they also offer good advice. I
certainly place a high value on advice from my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schiff, he said, has ``given a lot of good advice, and the
best recently was her idea to go back to the open meetings I had
done in the Congress. She told me to just throw away the script.''
</P>
<P>
   Wave after wave of upheaval within the Gore campaign, and
especially the recent controversy over whether Ms. Wolf has been
trying to turn the candidate into a more aggressive ``alpha male,''
has left the impression that Gore is too often a victim of his last
conversation _ unsure of himself and apt to lean heavily on
handlers, careening from one to another in search of the perfect
guru.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of former aides, many of whom still have great
affection for the vice president, are adamant that his problem is
not that he takes too much advice from consultants, but too little.
The high turnover, in this view, comes not because he trusts
himself too little, but too much, constantly changing consultants
in search of new ones who might be more apt to agree with him.
</P>
<P>
   And while that assessment is self-serving on its face, there is
a consensus among Gore's friends that he does prefer his family's
advice, at least in part because they are so supportive, generally
mirroring his own feelings, and encouraging him to do what he
wanted to do all along.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in New York, Ms. Schiff confirmed that her
advice often consists of encouraging her father to trust his own
political impulses. Asked whether she urged him to distance himself
from the president, she said: ``The best advice to him is to follow
his own compass. He has better instincts than anybody. And doing
that, following his own compass, makes him feel better. That's why
he feels so good now. It wasn't appropriate for him to do last year
the things it is important for him to do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-favor former aides generally see Gore's reliance on
family as more of a liability. They see Ms. Schiff; her mother,
Tipper, and Frank Hunger, who was married to Gore's late sister,
Nancy, as simply too close to the candidate to be objective. And
vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of us are just interchangeable operatives in this
dirty business of politics,'' said one disaffected former
consultant. ``When it comes down to the real decisions? It's
Karenna, Tipper and his gut. He loves his family more than he wants
to be president, and that's admirable, but it's also his Achilles
heel.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One former senior adviser blamed Ms. Schiff for the disastrous
news conference her father gave in March 1997, when he said there
was ``no controlling legal authority'' that prohibited him from
making telephone calls from the White House to raise campaign money
in 1996. Every one of Gore's paid advisers had told him he was not
ready to go in front of the television cameras; the facts were not
in, they said. But his daughter strongly disagreed with the
professionals, the adviser said, and told her father to follow his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``no controlling legal authority'' came not from Ms.
Schiff, but from a lawyer. Still, the former adviser said, ``She
was the person who, when he wasn't ready to give a press
conference, told him that because he was innocent and good, he
should just go on out there and people would see that he hadn't
done anything wrong, and he listened to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that conversation with his daughter, Gore said in
the phone interview; ``I don't remember that, no. I don't know
where that comes from. My memory might have faded, but I don't
think so. Did you ask Karenna?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, and she said this: ``Everyone has probably experienced that
with a family member that they just want to be helpful to him. So I
don't know. I don't want to respond to the specifics. But I always
feel that the more people see my dad and hear him, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, aides said Gore's preference for keeping
politics all in the family is evidence not only of his deep feeling
for his nearest relations but also of his decidedly mixed feelings
about the business of politics. Even beyond the family circle, he
tends to prefer Ivy League-educated outsiders like Ms. Wolf who are
not political professionals, even though many such professionals
are on his campaign payroll.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schiff, too, seemed to show a certain disdain for
professional political consultants when she said of Ms. Wolf:
``She's not just an operative. She's a committed, idealistic
person.''
</P>
<P>
   And a political person is not how she sees herself, either.
``I'm not a political consultant or anything like that,'' she said,
with just the vaguest pinch of horror.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   If she were, experience suggests that her father might not be
listening so closely; he has a long history of rejecting the
professional advice for which he has paid top dollar in favor of
input from his family.
</P>
<P>
   Several people who worked on Gore's 1988 presidential campaign
said he routinely ignored their suggestions after family chats with
his father, former Sen. Albert Gore, and his mother, Pauline Gore.
</P>
<P>
   After a middling showing on Super Tuesday that year, the
campaign staff concluded that the only way to keep going was to
forego states where competition would be expensive, like Illinois,
which had two favorite sons in the Democratic primary that year,
Sen. Paul Simon and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Instead, the plan was
to concentrate on smaller states like Indiana and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   But the elder Gore made it clear that no serious candidate
bypassed Illinois, and his son agreed. In the end, the campaign
spent big money in the state, to no purpose, and limped into New
York, where it finally gave out.
</P>

<P>
   Already in the 1988 campaign, Ms. Schiff was an adviser in the
making, listening and offering her views. By 1996, after college
and a year in Spain, she was traveling extensively with the vice
president and heavily involved in the debate preparations for his
debate with the Republican vice-presidential candidate, former Rep.
Jack Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   The staff liked having her around. ``She'd come back and talk to
reporters on the plane and have a beer or two, and she instilled a
sense of comfort,'' said Ginny Terzano, Gore's former press
secretary. ``You knew he was more at ease when she was around.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the candidate and his daughter talk constantly, and as she
has gained more influence she has inevitably drawn more criticism,
too. Today the verdict on her influence is pretty much split:
Former aides, with a few exceptions, feel she is so much like her
father, arrogance included, that she reinforces his worst impulses.
Those still at the table say by way of praising her that she is so
much like him, especially intellectually, that she brings out the
best in him.
</P>
<P>
   Both father and daughter are smart, Harvard-educated, fascinated
by technology and happy at home after marrying young. (She also,
friends agree, has the leavening of her mother's warmth and charm.)
</P>
<P>
   ``They all believe that you meet someone on a train and you know
right away that it's right,'' said Ms. Schiff's college roommate,
Sarah Bianchi, who also works for the Gore campaign. ``It's very
romantic.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Schiff can have a harder edge, too, and is known inside
the campaign as a big believer in rapid responses in defense of her
father.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schiff also was Ms. Wolf's No. 1 defender during the recent
brouhaha over her involvement in the campaign, and won out over
other advisers who did not think Ms. Wolf should defend herself on
television. Ms. Brazile calls the two of them, Ms. Schiff and Ms.
Wolf, ``cut sisters,'' meaning ``cut from the same cloth.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Brazile said she, too, has come to rely on Ms. Schiff,
both because she has her father's ear and because she does a good
job of keeping her own ear to the ground. ``She's all the focus
group I need,'' Ms. Brazile said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schiff talks to the campaign staff on a daily basis, passes
on her concerns and even suggests additions to the vice president's
schedule. Sometimes she sits in on his interviews. And she is just
starting to give some of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch at a diner on Manhattan's Upper East Side, where she
lives with her husband, Drew, and their new baby Wyatt, Ms. Schiff
is cheerful despite a sleepless night and determined not to make
too much of the fact that she is nursing, carrying a full class
load in her third year at Columbia Law School and working on her
father's campaign, where she directs Gorenet, a project intended to
get more young people involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel a bit off-balance sometimes, but then I think about
single mothers and what they do is incredible,'' she said. ``This
experience has tuned me in to what people go through.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about her own political aspirations, Ms. Schiff is
neither too eager nor overly coy. ``I'm sort of embarrassed to be
asked, because I know so many people who are articulate and bright
and have worked hard and aren't being asked that question,'' she
said. But I wouldn't rule it out because I think it should be a
really attractive career to someone my age. I hate it when people
say, `Ew, politics.' It's a noble profession.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Schiff never seems to lose sight of the fact that this
particular campaign is about her father. And as she, always his
daughter, hastens to add, about America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in him,'' she says. ``And I believe he's going to be
a great president for our country.''

TEMPERS FLARE IN U.N. COUNCIL OVER STALEMATE ON IRAQ ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Nearly a year after arms inspectors fled Iraq
in the face of imminent U.S. bombing, tempers flared in the
Security Council Friday over the inability of the major powers to
agree on how to resume the process of disarming Saddam Hussein and
lifting sanctions that have weighed on Iraqis for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   In a polite but dramatic show of impatience with the council's
five permanent members, who have been meeting privately for more
than six months without producing a new disarmament plan, several
of the 10 nations holding nonpermanent seats in effect told the
group _ known as the P-5 and comprising Britain, China, France,
Russia and the United States _ to stop stalling.
</P>
<P>
   ``For over a year the council has failed in its responsibility
to deal effectively with the Iraq problem,'' said Robert Fowler,
Canada's representative. Argentina, Brazil and Gambia echoed that
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   What turned into an unexpectedly tense meeting had been called
because Russia, breaking ranks with its four fellow veto-wielding
members, objected to a renewal of the existing ``oil for food''
program, under which Iraq is selling about $7 billion in oil in the
current six-month period to pay for food, medicine, farm equipment
and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The council had been summoned to extend the program for two more
weeks, which it did, to allow more discussion on it and on how the
oil sales plan will relate to a larger disarmament resolution still
in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Peter van Walsum, representative of the Netherlands and
co-sponsor of a comprehensive resolution that would suspend some
sanctions on Iraq in calibration with Iraqi compliance with arms
inspections _ a resolution Russia has been resisting _ reflected a
broader irritation many U.N. members feel at the way council
deliberations are often sequestered and prolonged by the most
powerful nations when they cannot reach agreement.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been too intimately involved in the process for us to
underestimate the difficulties,'' van Walsum said of the vexed
disarmament plan. ``But we cannot conceal the fact that my
delegation is far from happy with the way the Iraq file is being
handled in the Security Council today.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the P-5 have been struggling with this issue for almost
six months, we, the nonpermanent members, have had approximately no
more than one progress report per month, courtesy of the United
Kingdom delegation. It is possible that this way of functioning and
this speed is acceptable to the permanent five. But we, the elected
members, simply cannot go on telling the other United Nations
members who have elected us that we are content to sit and wait for
white smoke to emerge from the H-5 _ the P-5 _ chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use the word H-5 because in my delegation we have started to
call the permanent five the `hereditary five.'''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Two of the five representatives _ Sir Jeremy Greenstock of
Britain and Sergey Lavrov of Russia _ sparred openly over what to
expect in the weeks to come. Britain, the United States and to an
uncertain degree France would like to see a comprehensive arms
resolution ready for a vote when the two-week postponement of the
oil program vote expires.
</P>
<P>
   Lavrov, who asked for a second chance to speak in order to make
his point twice, said there could be no ``artificial timetables''
or links between the two, a view repeated by China. Lavrov accused
other nations of holding suffering Iraqis hostage to policy
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Russia wants changes in the oil-sales program that would free
more money and goods for Iraq. The Russians, who are owed billions
of dollars by the Iraqis and foresee future lucrative contracts,
would also lift sanctions before introducing arms inspections. No
other permanent member now takes that position.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian delegation is now suddenly isolated and under
considerable pressure to compromise, diplomats say.

BLAIRS EXPECTING, TABLOIDS FROTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ When Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie,
found out they were going to be parents again, some 12 years after
the birth of their last child, the couple was, as Downing Street's
official spokesman diplomatically put it, ``gobsmacked.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Britain reacted similarly Friday as news spread that
Mrs. Blair is three months pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blair is 45, and by their own admission, the Blairs weren't
trying to have another child. She is a busy, prominent lawyer in
London.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, who is 46, will be the first sitting British prime
minister in more than a century and a half to have a child born
while in power and to welcome an infant at the prime minister's
Downing Street residence, a home that is already a bit cramped with
their three other children. (The official residence adjoins the
prime minister's offices at 10 Downing.)
</P>
<P>
   The Blairs had wanted to keep the news private, at least until
Mrs. Blair was well into her second trimester and was showing. But
they told friends, and Queen Elizabeth II was informed, and the
news inevitably leaked out.
</P>
<P>
   For the tabloids, this is manna from heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cherie Is Pregnant'' blared The Mirror, whose questions forced
Downing Street officials to confirm the pregnancy Thursday night.
That did not stop one of its competitors, Rupert Murdoch's The Sun,
from carrying the same headline and claiming it had a ``world
exclusive.'' The Mirror demurely called its own story ``Scoop of
the Year.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is just a taste of things to come. Mrs. Blair's
pregnancy will be the most scrutinized since Princess Diana became
pregnant for the first time 17 years ago. What she eats, how much
weight she gains, what she wears and anything else the tabloids can
dig up will become fodder for a voracious publicity machine that
swung into full gear Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Blairs' privacy will be invaded like never before. Already,
the newspapers have calculated that their child was conceived in
August at a secluded villa in Tuscany where the Blairs spent a
three-week vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Weaver, the deputy editor of The Mirror who broke the
story, said Blair raves about the romance of Tuscany, where he
proposed to his wife and took her on their honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   The pregnancy was the topic of conversation everywhere. On the
national Talk Radio network, callers debated whether it was really
an unplanned pregnancy or a ploy by the media-savvy Blair to
increase his already considerable popularity with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Harlow, a buyer for a British supermarket chain, said her
office was buzzing with the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so cynical,'' said Harlow. ``Most people were
saying they think Blair did this for political reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who think that probably do not know Mrs. Blair, a
prominent London lawyer who, according to friends, wanted to spend
more time at work, not less. She was already Britain's most
prominent ``working mum.'' Now she has suddenly and unwittingly
become a role model for career women who have children in their
40s.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation Friday that the Downing Street residence
might not be big enough for another Blair. Their other children _
Euan, 15, Nicholas, 14, and Kathryn, 11 _ have complained about the
lack of space. Blair has said he once had to ask the kids to turn
down the television while he was on the phone with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But moving the Blairs to another home in London would be a
security nightmare, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Press secretary Alistair Campbell, who is the bookies' odds-on
favorite to be the child's godfather, said Blair was stunned when
he learned that he would soon be up at night ``changing nappies
again.'' Campbell said the only thing that keeps Blair up at night
now is Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Under British law, Blair will be entitled to take three months'
paternity leave. He will come under pressure from various groups to
take all or none of that time.
</P>
<P>
   As she left Downing Street Friday, Mrs. Blair fielded the first
of many questions from reporters about how she felt. She said she
was fine. When asked what her reaction to her pregnancy was, Mrs.
Blair arched her eyebrows, smiled and said, ``Very surprised.''

THE COLLEGE APPLICATION BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 21)  
 (bl)  
 By CASEY SCHWARTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a few weeks before my 17th birthday and I am in New Haven,
Conn., standing on Hill House Avenue in the shadow of the Yale
admissions office. On this humid Friday morning in late July, the
campus feels deserted, but I am not alone. Scores of cars filled
with nervous Yale applicants and their grim-faced parents appear on
the tree-lined street. Our group crowds the admissions office lawn.
We stare at each other warily. Soon, our tour guide joins us,
introducing himself as Mike. ``I'm from San Francisco,'' Mike says.
``I love it here at Yale.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course he loves it, I think. He's already gotten in.
</P>
<P>
   This is my fifth college visit, and I am familiar with the
amazing ability of college-student guides to walk backward while
rattling off a monologue of campus facts. As a gathering some
50-strong, we walk with Mike past the dorms, the classrooms and the
dining halls. ``There are just too many of you to take into a
room,'' he says. ``You are a huge group.''
</P>
<P>
   There are so many of us that our information session has to be
moved from the cozy college admissions office with its Oriental
carpets to a science lecture hall. There are so many of us that we
are front page news: 14.8 million students, an all-time high,
registered for college this fall, and new freshman classes will
continue to grow. The number of high-school seniors who took the
College Boards this year was more than 1.3 million, compared with
980,000 in 1977, the peak year that baby boomers reached college
age.
</P>
<P>
   I expected the college application process to be difficult, but
I could not have predicted this hysteria. At the Horace Mann
School, where I am a senior, four full-time college counselors work
overtime. They have become adept at deflecting our dozens of
questions about our chances. The term ``high reach'' is used
frequently to describe our desire to be accepted by our
first-choice schools.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Singer, the head of the college counseling office, likes
to tell parents, ``In Manhattan, people talk about three things _
IPOs, real estate and college admissions.'' We hear a phrase over
and over: ``The numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers'' is shorthand for the growing competition to get
into good colleges, not just among New York private-school
students, but from everywhere. U.S. News &AMP; World Report's issue on
America's best universities is on the Web and read by students in
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; Perth, Australia; and Oslo, Norway, where
panicky 17-year-olds just like me will be sending in applications
to the same colleges. Tufts University rejected one-third of the
valedictorians who applied last year. The same for Wesleyan. Of
13,000 applying to Princeton, 1,700 were accepted. We have more
information than we want to know.
</P>
<P>
   December and April are nightmare months at Horace Mann. Seniors
often sob in the halls when they hear they have been rejected by
their first-choice schools. But the crying starts, incredibly, in
the beginning months of our junior year. ``I got a C-plus on my
economics test,'' one of my friends cried last year. ``How can I
even apply to Stanford now?''
</P>
<P>
   The worst part of this autumn is the realization that suddenly
close friends are pitted against each other. The other day, an
admissions officer from Brown came to Horace Mann for an
information session. By the time he arrived, the college office's
reception area was overflowing with more than 40 of my classmates.
The admissions officer brought with him a real live Brown senior.
We all stared at her, fascinated, intimidated, envious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we don't have quotas for each high school, we do
compare the applicants from the same high school to each other,''
the admissions officer said. Immediately the atmosphere in the room
changed. We began to swerve in our seats, staring at who had showed
up, estimating the competition's grades and test scores and
accomplishments. My friend Stephen whispered to me, ``Did you know
that John is about to publish a children's cookbook?''
</P>
<P>
   Many adults believe that children today are missing out on a
childhood. The truth is that we aren't; we have a childhood, but
one with rewritten rules. Parents of 3-year-olds befriend college
trustees. College Boards tutors are hired to coach seventh graders.
</P>
<P>
   I am walking my dog near Gracie Mansion, New York City's mayoral
residence, when I run into a neighbor whose daughter is my age,
although at a different school. She looks frazzled and is coming at
me. I try to cross the street, but I miss the light. ``So, where
are you applying to college?'' she asks. Before I can answer, she
says, ``I told my daughter that if she doesn't get into Yale or
Harvard or Columbia, she might as well get a job at Starbucks. I'm
not paying the tuition at any other place. What's the point?''
</P>
<P>
   I am sorry to report that this kind of conversation no longer
surprises me.
</P>
<P>
   At the senior table in the cafeteria, a favorite topic is the
college essay. Our ideas for these essays have been talked about,
worried over and picked apart as though they were doctoral theses.
I've heard about family renovation projects, Chinese
calligraphy-class epiphanies and what it means to live through a
brother's illness or a parent's death. When early-decision
deadlines were just weeks away, the glossy applications stacked on
my desk were all still blank. I'd written the first paragraph 11
times.
</P>
<P>
   I hear the sentence ``It looks good on a college transcript''
often. It's a thought that is clearly toxic, implying opportunism,
but it motivates many of my classmates through their yearbook
meetings, Junior Statesmen of America competitions, water polo
games and community service projects painting homeless shelters in
the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When I was a sophomore two years ago, a girl in the grade above
joined my cross-country team. She rarely came to practice _ she was
too busy at College Boards prep classes three afternoons a week _
and right after mailing her college applications, she quit the
team. The season had weeks to go. At the time, I was surprised she
didn't apologize for letting the rest of us down. Now, I
understand.
</P>
<P>
   That summer I applied to be a counselor at a summer camp for
underprivileged children. The camp was extraordinary, a nonprofit
organization designed to give destitute children who met the city
welfare administration's lowest standard a few weeks of happiness
in the country. The staff members were volunteers. I went to be
interviewed for the job. I talked to the woman who ran the program
for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   She showed me pictures of some of the children and told me
poignant stories about their lives. As I left, she said, ``Best of
all, Casey, this will look fabulous on your college application.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, The New York Times published a lengthy story on
Loren Easton, that year's Horace Mann valedictorian. The article
emphasized the college-obsessed, elitist values of Horace Mann
parents and students. ``If someone gets rejected from Harvard, all
their friends will hate the person who got in,'' one student was
quoted as saying.

   Loren appeared to lust after the Ivy League. ``I knew no public
school could offer what Horace Mann does,'' he said. ``A lot of
people think that getting into the Ivy League is very important. I
guess I think that way too.''
</P>
<P>
   I was embarrassed by the article and the portrait of my
classmates, but mostly I was indignant at the reporter. My friends
and I denied that this was our reality. We could not imagine it in
our futures. Now I see myself and all my friends uncomfortably
close to Loren Easton.
</P>
<P>
   Is this who we really are? I hope not. In fact, we are some of
the luckiest students in the world to have been able to afford to
go to such elite private schools. Why then do we feel like victims
of privilege? The paradox, we are now told, is that we would have
an easier time moving up and on in the world if we were not
educated in New York City private schools. If only we were applying
from a Sioux Indian reservation in Montana, how that would appeal
to diversity-minded admissions officers.
</P>
<P>
   If only we had spent a year in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   If only we were Latino or from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   These ``if onlys'' have become the overpowering white noise _ in
both senses of the term _ of the class of 2000 at my school. It is
unseemly. Above the din, can anyone answer the larger question:
Does this really matter for our educations and our futures?
</P>
<P>
   At Yale last summer, an admissions officer named Peter Chemery
sought to cheer up my tour group about the numbers. ``You have to
keep telling yourself, out of 13,000 applicants a year, 2,100 are
accepted,'' he said. He repeated, ``Two thousand one hundred are
accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   We stumbled out of the information session clutching our Yale
catalogs, as if for the last time. Back at the admissions office, I
waited for my interview. I saw Mike, the student guide, meeting his
2 p.m. group. I noticed that there were fewer people waiting than
the mob I had. Mike noticed too. ``Oh good, a small group,'' he
said. ``We can get rid of the riffraff.'' I don't think he was
kidding.

 &HT;    BCS computer rankers live by their own codes
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For the purpose of providing a sense of order to
its chaotic world, college football called an audible in the
off-season. It changed last year's Bowl Championship Series and
turned to five sincere, common-sense common-Joes with uncommon
skills whose ages, occupations and hobbies are as diverse as the
teams they are asked to evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   They are the collective geniuses _ or pencil-necked nerds,
depending upon your point of view _ behind the five new computer
ratings that were incorporated into the complicated BCS, whose
assignment is to help determine the two teams that will play for
the mythical Division I-A national championship. Just a small task
that will determine a total payday approaching $26 million for the
Sugar Bowl in New Orleans on Jan. 4 and $104 million for four major
bowl games.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS ratings have grown in volume, making the entire process
even more confusing, more convoluted and, to some, more outrageous
because it still doesn't take place entirely on the playing field.
In some respects, the oft-criticized BCS has become a descendant of
the despised IRS. ``But we don't take anybody's money,'' defends
Charles Bloom, the assistant commissioner of the Southeastern
Conference who releases the ratings each week.
</P>
<P>
   Tell it to Kansas State, which fell out of the BCS with one loss
a year ago and plummeted to what it felt was the second-rate Alamo
Bowl. The difference was at least $800,000 to KSU and about $9
million to the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the BCS folks did the math. More would be better.
So the computer rankings swelled by five.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the five men who create the new statistical formulas
ever played a down of football other than in the back yard. Why
one, Richard Billingsley, jokes that at 5 feet, 7 inches and 190
pounds, he was too small to be a high school cheerleader. And even
69-year-old Kentuckian Herman Matthews said he took a beating as a
132-pound end at Edinburg High School in Texas in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   All of them not surprisingly hold allegiances to certain teams.
One of them, 23-year-old Kenneth Massey, is a graduate student at
Virginia Tech who attends games regularly and whose father is a
longtime season ticket-holder. Yes, the same No. 2-rated Virginia
Tech. Billingsley openly roots for his boyhood favorite team, the
Oklahoma Sooners.
</P>
<P>
   None of the men is paid for his work, although several run
advertisements on their web pages for products like athletic gear
or on-line hookups to radio broadcasts of games.
</P>
<P>
   Together, John Duck, David Rothman, Herman Matthews, Massey and
Billingsley are now as big of giants of college football as Notre
Dame's Four Horsemen and the Heisman Trophy. They joined forces
with the three computer services that helped work through the magic
numbers last year to dispatch Tennessee and Florida State to the
Fiesta Bowl to decide who was No. 1. The original computer ratings
are still supplied by Jeff Sagarin, the Seattle Times and the New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times' rankings, incidentally, are crunched by
Marjorie Connally. Yes, a woman. That's progress. More progress
than unbeaten Marshall has made at making the national championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   Not according to Billingsley, who receives 99 percent of his
hate mail these days from Marshall fans. Those Mid-American
Conference maniacs have gone nuts over his 32nd rating of their
favorite team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know college football fans could be so vicious,''
cracked Billingsley, a 48-year personnel consultant from the
outskirts of Nashville, Tenn. ``I have had 'em as low as 48th.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't even think about suggesting he has an anti-Marshall bias.
Thundering Herd backers can stand in line. When Billingsley's
service was chosen as one of the 1999 computer additions, he was
hailed by Oklahoma fans as their long-awaited savior. They were
doing cartwheels when they heard Billingsley was a lifelong Sooners
fan from Hugo, Okla. They stopped when he had them ranked 48th
despite a 3-0 record when Billingsley's colleagues had OU in their
top 20. He had betrayed the Sooners. The mail ended with losses to
Notre Dame and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life for these men since they were added to the mazelike
mix of computer rankings. COMPUTER EXPLOSION
</P>
<P>
   When Roy Kramer, the BCS's founding father and Southeastern
Conference commissioner, first looked at the world of computerized
football ratings, he couldn't believe his eyes. He hadn't figured
on the hundreds that were out there. After 1999, Kramer and Bloom
reviewed close to 60 ratings and finally settled on five
established services to bring to eight the number of mathematical
statistical reviews. All but one were recognized by the NCAA, which
included the data in its annual record book.
</P>
<P>
   The two men had distinct criteria. They preferred services that
were published by newspapers. All but Massey's and Rothman's are,
but Massey is considering selling his to one. The five men were
sent letters advising them not to be associated with gambling and
to refrain from speculation. Rothman was particularly surprised to
be picked because he had written a piece that criticized the BCS
and even opened with the words ``what a load of crap.''
</P>
<P>
   The BCS wanted established ratings, insisting that all predated
at least 1995. Duck assumed the distribution of the Dunkel Index
created in 1929 by Dick Dunkel Sr., the retired editor of the
Daytona Beach News-Journal. Billingsley's extensive data _ first
compiled in 1970 _ goes back to the 1869 season. Matthews, chairman
of the math department at Lincoln Memorial University in Harrogate,
Tenn., launched his service in 1965. Rothman started working out
the bugs in his own system as far back as the early 1970s. Massey
started in 1995, but he's so into this computer deal he rates every
American sport there is from the WNBA to college hockey.
</P>
<P>
   In Rothman's rankings, his system is so pure and devoid of
influence by previous history that it's as if ``689 college
football teams (from all divisions) arrived from Mars on Aug. 25.''
Perhaps that's why his early No. 2 ranking of Marshall brought a
lot of flak.
</P>
<P>
   Trust us, you don't want to get into an argument with the
64-year-old Rothman. He almost has to be begged to reveal an IQ
that's higher than 160. He's a former top-flight bridge player,
started college in Wisconsin at age 16 and attended a national
defense seminar at Harvard led by Henry Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   Think he's into numbers? He logged in this phone call at 8:55
Thursday morning and at the conclusion of the conversation informed
the reporter the interview was one minute shy of an hour. Of
course, when you're dealing with an educated man who worked on a
team that designed the Orbiter lifting frame that places the space
shuttle atop airplanes for transportation, even computer football
is rocket science.
</P>
<P>
   But why did Kramer settle on eight rankings? Since they throw
out a team's lowest computer ranking so one out-of-whack score
doesn't disproportionately cripple a team, they wind up with seven
ratings. There are fewer opportunities for ties with seven than
eight ratings because of the odd number.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Kramer says one of the major criticisms leveled at the
BCS last year was the shortage of computer rankings because they
had such a huge impact. ``It's like going to the doctor,'' Kramer
says, ``you get two or three opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY
</P>
<P>
   None of the input for the rankings is identical. They all
emphasize varying factors. Massey's formula considers home-field
advantage and gives a slight edge to teams that win defensive
games. ``I think a 10-0 win deserves more credit than a 40-30
win,'' he says. Billingsley's credits head-to-head winners more
heavily.
</P>
<P>
   All of them cut off scoring margins at 21 points, precluding the
desire of some coaches to run up big numbers on outmanned
opponents. The Seattle Times doesn't even calculate scoring margin
in its formula.
</P>
<P>
   Billingsley even lobbied Kramer to be allowed to ``adjust'' his
final numbers to include some common-sense judgment. Like when Team
A beats Team B but is still ranked slightly behind Team B, he'd
like to flipflop the two. Kramer refused. He figured that element
would be taken into account by the 70 voters in the Associated
Press media poll and the 60 coaches in the ESPN/USA Today poll.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS will consider expanding the number of computer rankings
before next season. Bloom said they probably shouldn't even release
the results of the first BCS ratings until November and wouldn't
but for the outcry that would result. Competitors try to figure out
the rankings before they're released, as CBS Sportsline did this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer hesitates to suggest the public has grown to accept the
BCS but does think fans are willing to wait out the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the dust is all cleared, I think people felt the two best
teams met in the Fiesta (Bowl) last year,'' he said. ``I think a
playoff would dilute the regular season. To me, we would lose a
little bit of the heart of college football. We would put all the
money and attention into one game. What does that do to the Ole
Misses and Wake Forests and Texas Techs and Iowa States of the
world? But I'm not here to say we'll never have a playoff. I'll
never say never.''

TOBACCO LAWYERS TAKE $3.3 BILLION IN FEES IN TEXAS CASE  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Private lawyers who helped Texas negotiate its
tobacco settlement gave up their claim for payment from state
dollars Friday, but they may not be through fighting Texas Attorney
General John Cornyn.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn commended their decision to ``let the taxpayers off the
hook'' but vowed to continue his investigation into the work they
conducted under an agreement with his predecessor, Democrat Dan
Morales.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers filed their decision with U.S. District Judge David
Folsom of Texarkana, meeting Folsom's deadline to choose between
$3.3 billion in fees awarded them by arbitrators or a share of the
state's settlement that would have paid them $2.3 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   The $3.3 billion is to be paid by tobacco companies over an
undetermined number of years. The lawyers already have received
about $350 million from cigarette makers, according to the attorney
general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tigar, a former University of Texas law professor who
represents the outside lawyers, said his clients believe the
arbitration award ``fairly and reasonably compensates them'' for
their efforts in securing a $17.3 billion tobacco settlement for
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Tigar said the $3.3 billion payout may not be as big as it
seems because the payments will be made over ``many, many years,
dozens of years, perhaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Tigar said the fees, in current dollars, were worth about $1.2
billion and would be shared by six law firms. They include five
Texas firms hired by Morales and a sixth firm from South Carolina
that the Texas lawyers brought into the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have over the past several months been listening to the
people of Texas,'' Tigar said, citing recent newspaper editorials
urging an end to the 22-month-old dispute.
</P>
<P>
   He said the lawyers wanted to end the controversy over legal
fees because it was threatening to obscure ``what a wonderful
victory'' the tobacco settlement was for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will take unilaterally the first long step towards
healing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tigar said the attorneys made their final decision to
unconditionally waive their state contract for fees Friday morning,
only a few hours before a deadline set two weeks ago by Folsom.
</P>
<P>
   Tigar said Cornyn and the judge also had to approve the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``My clients have never wanted to put the state on the hook.
They have said that over and over, and some have doubted their
word. Today, we make clear that they have kept their word,'' Tigar
added.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, who contended the state contract could have been worth
more than $12 billion in fees to the lawyers and their heirs over
the next 50 years, said he was ``very pleased'' with the lawyers'
decision.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted there would be no ``quid pro quo.'' He said he
wouldn't drop his separate investigation into the legality of their
contract with Morales and wouldn't agree to their offer to have
Folsom oversee his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Tigar had indicated earlier that one reason the lawyers hadn't
already dropped their claim against the state was to maintain some
leverage in case Cornyn should sue them for alleged misconduct and
try to recover monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers initially were to decide on their fees by last Dec.
30, but Folsom let that deadline pass by.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Cornyn wouldn't say what action, if any, he would
take against the lawyers if he uncovers evidence of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do reserve the full range of legal options that are
available to the state of Texas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Cornyn is believed to be investigating
allegations made last year by famed Houston trial lawyer Joe Jamail
that Morales demanded payments from lawyers he considered hiring
for the tobacco lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Jamail was interviewed by Morales but not hired. Morales and a
spokesman for the outside lawyers have denied Jamail's allegations.
The alleged payments were supposedly to help Morales pay for a
public relations defense fund against the tobacco companies during
the lawsuit.

VODAFONE SWEETENS ITS TAKEOVER OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ALAN COWELL and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Vodafone Airtouch PLC on Friday sweetened the terms of
its offer for Mannesmann AG, bidding $127.7 billion in stock in a
move that could vastly inflate the size of wireless telephone
companies and fundamentally reshape Europe's rapidly growing
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, Vodafone's offer would surpass the $115 billion
takeover of Sprint by MCI Worldcom as the biggest takeover ever.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the rebuttal of earlier overtures by Mannesmann, the
German engineering and telecommunications giant, Vodafone offered
53.7 of its own shares for each Mannesmann share, giving the deal a
valuation of 240 euros, or $247.20, a Mannesmann share. That
represents an 18 percent increase on Vodafone's initial bid last
Sunday of $106.4 billion and a 54 percent premium over Mannesmann's
share price on Oct. 18 before takeover speculation began.
</P>
<P>
   But Vodafone's sweetened offer Friday was quickly spurned by
Mannesmann. The offer immediately raised the question of whether
the amount was high enough to persuade Mannesmann shareholders to
trade their stock in Germany's high-flying and highly priced
engineering and telecommunications company for Vodafone's promises
of future growth based on the combined company's massive projected
reach in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Commerzbank quickly issued a ``buy'' rating on Mannesmann
shares, arguing that shareholders should dismiss Vodafone's bid,
which it said undervalued the German conglomerate by 40 euros
($41.20) a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental value of Mannesmann is worth about 230 euros
per share,'' said Doug Wight, an analyst at Commerzbank in London.
``Anyone bidding for the company should be paying a fairly decent
premium, making a takeout price of 280.'' He added, ``If Vodafone
gets it at 240 they've done very well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Graham Wood, director of equities at Standard Life
Investments, which has about 2 percent of its managed assets in
Vodafone and 0.25 percent in Mannesmann, asserted the price was
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once upon a time, people were able to get away with high
premiums,'' he said, ``but with valuations at these levels, it just
doesn't make any sense to go any higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Gent, the Vodafone chief executive, said no cash
would be added to what he called a ``final offer.'' But Vodafone
would also assume 19.4 billion euros or nearly $20 billion in
combined debt from Mannesmann and Orange PLC _ the No. 3 British
wireless operator, which was acquired by Mannesmann last month.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann's $33-billion acquisition of Orange triggered
Vodafone's bid since it transformed the German company from a
partner in several European wireless ventures into a competitor on
Vodafone's home turf.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting investor worries that the deal could fail, both
Mannesmann and Vodafone shares declined Friday. Mannesmann slumped
6.9 percent to 193.10 euros ($198.89) in Frankfurt and Vodafone
shares dropped 2.8 percent to 275.5 pence ($4.44) in London.
Vodafone's American depository receipts rose 93.75 cents on the New
York Stock Exchange to $47.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover faces thickets of regulatory problems in Germany
and Europe and intense resistance from Klaus Esser, the Mannesmann
chief executive, who wrote Gent Thursday requesting him to withdraw
his bid.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Mannesmann's own by-laws state that no investor
may control more than 5 percent of the voting rights, however large
their equity stake. That restriction expires in June, however.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts and investors were divided over whether
Vodafone's bid price was fair, almost all agreed that the
acquisition of Mannesmann was important to Vodafone's survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a deal, Vodafone is strategically challenged,'' said
John Monnelly, an investment manager at Martin Currie Ltd., which
has stakes in Vodafone, Mannesmann and Orange. ``They need this
badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he acknowledged, ``There are a lot of egos standing
in the way of what should be a logical fit.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gent told a news conference in London that Vodafone would seek
the support of at least 50 percent of Mannesmann stockholders in
the next few weeks, arguing that the deal offers a chance to invest
in what he termed ``the largest wireless operator in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   With 50 percent of the stock under its control, Gent said,
Vodafone would begin navigating through German corporate law, first
by replacing shareholder representatives on Mannesmann's
supervisory board _ a broad, policy-setting body _ and then by
moving against the management board headed by Esser.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that when we get above 50 percent, the management
board will cooperate with us,'' Gent said. ``It'll just take
longer'' without cooperation from managers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone sent its proposal to a meeting of the Mannesmann
supervisory board in Duesseldorf Friday, in what seemed little more
than a strategy to soften the impression of hostilities in a
country where there has never been a successful hostile takeover.
``The offer is not meant to be hostile to any of the shareholders,
management or employees of Mannesmann,'' Gent said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mannesmann urged shareholders to reject the Vodafone offer.
In a statement Friday night, Mannesmann said the proposal ``does
not reflect the potential offered to Mannesmann's shareholders by
the combination of Mannesmann and Orange into a leading, integrated
European telecommunications service.''
</P>
<P>
   Gent planned to travel in Germany _ where Vodafone is widely
seen as a red-fanged predator _ to try to convince investors,
regulators and public opinion that the bid really represents a
chance for them to carve a slice of what he depicts as the huge
boom to come in Internet wireless technology, mobile phones and
wireless data transmission.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, the market for corporate mobile data services
would be worth more than $80 billion a year by 2005 as new
technology is developed enabling wireless devices to transmit data
as efficiently as fixed-line fiber-optics do now.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone is presently the junior partner with Mannesmann in
lucrative wireless operations in Germany and Italy. But Vodafone
has a broader array of wireless holdings from Sweden to Greece and
a powerful position in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, Vodafone says, the two companies would dominate the
wireless business in 13 countries _ including Europe's biggest
markets _ operate in 13 more and control 31 million customers.
Combined sales would be worth more than $6 billion a year, Gent
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The deal is complicated by Mannesmann's structure as a combined
engineering and telecommunications corporation with fixed-line and
wireless businesses. Vodafone is committed to wireless technology.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Mannesmann's acquisition of Orange presents
regulatory problems since Vodafone would not be allowed under
British competition laws to own a second British mobile phone
company.
</P>
<P>
   Gent said Vodafone would sell off Mannesmann's engineering and
automotive businesses _ as Mannesmann had already said it would.
But it would keep majority control of the German company's fixed
line businesses while selling a 25 percent stake through a share
offering. He said Orange would be run independently until Vodafone
could sell it as a separate entity to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The Vodafone move Friday represents a huge, high-stakes personal
gamble for Gent, a smooth-talking onetime bank clerk who has
propelled himself into the ranks of the world's corporate
high-rollers that began with Vodafone's $70-billion takeover of
Airtouch of California last January.
</P>
<P>
   If the bid is successful, Gent could end up, based on present
stock values, running a company worth upward of $200 billion, among
the world's biggest and second only in Britain to the oil giant BP
Amoco. But if it fails, the consequences could be equally dramatic,
possibly ending Vodafone's present junior partnership with
Mannesmann in Germany and Italy _ two of Europe's biggest markets _
and confirming suspicions that the British wireless operator has
tried to move too far too fast.

   SPEND-SENATE (Washington) _ Developments. Congress is set to

WHEN BANKING GETS PERSONAL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo., Idaho, Texas)   (af)  
 By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One size doesn't fit all. When it comes to banking, I have
decided that small is the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   I reached that conclusion after years of storing my cash with a
large financial conglomerate. During that time, I paid exorbitant
sums whenever my checking account dipped below the (unnecessarily
high) minimum. I found myself being charged twice for using a
different bank's ATM machine. And I was often penalized for bank
errors.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, I had endless telephone conversations with
customer service representatives who didn't know the bank's rules.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is something wonderful about belonging to a bank with
branches from Manhattan to Melbourne. But I'm tired of getting
charged a service fee every time I turn around. And now there are
banks in California that won't let other banks' customers use their
ATMs _ a response to a Santa Monica law banning some fees.
</P>
<P>
   Many people I know share my opinion about banks _ that they
punish you for not having much money. Unless you're lucky enough to
have an employer that has worked out a special deal, it is
virtually impossible to have a no-fee account at a major New York
bank without keeping a tidy sum there, generally about $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Those with limited resources have limited options. Some banks,
like First Union in Charlotte, N.C., even have software that tells
employees which credit card customers make the bank the most money
and how to give them more privileges and more slack.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that some young people are leaving big banks
in favor of institutions where, even if everyone doesn't know your
name, they try to.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Naugle, 26, a magazine editor who has been living in
Manhattan since 1996, keeps her money in Colorado Springs _ with
ENT Federal Credit Union, the same institution she used when she
was growing up. She considered opening a bank account in New York,
but decided it wasn't worth it because of high minimum balances and
monthly fees.
</P>
<P>
   At her credit union, she has no minimum balance requirement and
pays no checking, transaction, ATM or monthly fees. She has found
that her Colorado checks are fully welcomed in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I worried that I'd have problems if I didn't have a
bank here, that someone wouldn't accept my check,'' she said, ``but
so far that hasn't happened.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just big-city people who are going small. Ryan
Patterson, 26, lives in Boise, Idaho. The owner of a CD-ROM
production company, Patterson switched from a big bank to Farmers
and Merchants State Bank, a small institution in Boise _ ``for the
personality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know my name, my direction and my dreams,'' he added.
``They spend time getting to know me and are interested in my
business for the long term, not how much money they can make off
me.''
</P>
<P>
   To get away from high fees, some people are diving into Internet
banks. According to an estimate by Dataquest, a market research
firm, 24.2 million households will be banking online by 2004, up
from 7 million in 1998. (The estimate was reported by the Web site
Money-rates.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Many of these banks, including Telebank, First Internet Bank and
WingSpan, have low or no ATM fees and account minimums.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about convenience and instant access,'' said Dennis
Covington, 29, a Web producer in Dallas. ``I just go online to make
sure the proper amount gets deposited and I'm set.''
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that if you don't have direct deposit from an
employer, your checks can take days to arrive and clear through the
mail. And since the quickest way to withdraw money is by visiting
another bank's ATM, the process can become costly. Some Internet
banks, however, reimburse customers for several ATM fees a month.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the ultimate answer to the challenges young people
face when they enter a bank? I'm not quite sure. But banks continue
to merge and grow, and Congress has repealed the last limits on the
ability of financial conglomerates to become even larger. Finding a
bank that remains small, friendly and affordable will become harder
than ever.

WHY THE MARKET IS NEUTRAL ON RESEARCH SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill.)   (ART ADV: Graphic of R&AMP;D spending as a percent of dividends,
earnings and book value is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 21)  
 (af)  
 By MARK HULBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Students of the stock market have long worried that it does a
poor job of valuing the long-term benefits of corporate research
and development.
</P>
<P>
   All things being equal, a company that invests heavily in R&AMP;D
should be more profitable over the long run than one that doesn't.
Yet such companies are sometimes shunned by short-term traders
seeking a quick buck; they buy companies that reduce their R&AMP;D
budgets in favor of reporting higher earnings immediately.
</P>
<P>
   While undervaluing research is worrisome at any time, it is
particularly serious in today's technology-driven economy. In the
computer software sector, for example, the average R&AMP;D outlay
amounts to 17 percent of a company's total sales and two times its
earnings. A failure to value R&AMP;D correctly can lead to major
mispricing of a company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps that isn't happening. According to a new study by
Louis K.C. Chan, Joef Lakonishok and Theodore Sougiannis,
professors at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, there
seems to be no evidence that the market penalizes companies that
invest in R&AMP;D.
</P>
<P>
   For each year from 1975 to 1995, the researchers divided stocks
into two groups. The first group consisted of companies that
reported R&AMP;D expenditures that year; the second was composed of
those companies that did not. The professors then tracked the
subsequent three-year performance of each group.
</P>
<P>
   Through mid-1998, on average, the three-year annualized return
of the companies spending money on R&AMP;D was 19.65 percent,
statistically indistinguishable from the 19.50 percent return for
the others.
</P>
<P>
   So the professors think that investors, over all, neither
overvalue nor undervalue research spending. Of course, some
investors may be shunning companies that invest in research,
because of the stocks' higher price-to-earnings ratios. But the
effect is evidently balanced by other investors who look below the
surface and see the potential value of companies' research.
</P>
<P>
   Although the professors give the stock market a passing grade on
this subject, they found one subset of companies whose R&AMP;D
expenditures seemed to be systematically undervalued: those
companies that trade at low price-to-book multiples _ and are
therefore often considered value stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In this subset, the professors found that companies that
invested heavily in R&AMP;D outperformed those that didn't by nearly 8
percentage points, annualized, through 1998. That is an impressive
amount, given that value stocks in general have historically
outperformed the market anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, the stock market fails to recognize that when the
management of such companies spends big amounts on research, it is
a bullish signal. After all, such managers are often under intense
pressure to reduce their spending on research, thus increasing
short-term earnings and helping to raise the stock price. To invest
in R&AMP;D under those conditions speaks of extreme confidence on
management's part.
</P>
<P>
   The professors have a hypothesis about why the market does such
a poor job valuing such stocks: ``R&AMP;D-intensive firms who are past
losers become `orphaned' stocks with no natural underlying investor
clientele,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Growth investors, for example, tend to shun such market
laggards. And because those stocks still look expensive according
to the conventional valuation criteria, value-oriented investors
aren't likely to buy them, either.
</P>
<P>
   Such stocks fall through the cracks _ the ideal condition for
market mispricing.
</P>
<P>
   In short, R&AMP;D spending alone doesn't tell investors much about a
stock's prospects. But examining that spending in conjunction with
a stock's price-to-book multiple can yield a powerful indicator of
future performance. &QL;

SOMETHING HAPPENED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 21, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was only 51 when he died in 1980. No less a figure than Paul
Samuelson wrote his obituary in Newsweek. ``Arthur Okun was the
consummate macroeconomist,'' stated Samulelson. ``He was a young
and rising star in the Camelot days when President John F. Kennedy
was turning a stagnant economy around and initiating a decade of
sound economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Okun moved up to become a member of the Council of Economic
Advisers and ultimately chairman under President Lyndon Johnson, as
the Vietnam War built to a fever pitch. After that he spent the
next dozen years of his life _ the rest of it _ attempting to
devise a cure for stagflation that increasingly vexed the United
States in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He even had a law named after him,'' wrote Samuelson: ``Okun's
Law, a rule of thumb relating the unemployment rate and the change
in real gross national product, which has stood up remarkably well
considering the inexactless of economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a group of Camelot economists and various of
their heirs and assigns gathered at the Brookings Institution in
Washington to remember Okun nearly twenty years after he died. Talk
about the boys of summer! Walter Heller, Kermit Gordon and Gardner
Ackley are gone, James Tobin had hip surgery and so didn't come to
the meeting he had planned, Paul Samuelson was on limited duty
because he was doing so many other things (as usual.)
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Solow, William Capron, William Bainerd, George Perry,
Francis Bator, Richard Cooper, Sidney Winter were among the
economists from the Kennedy-Johnson era who turned out for the
conference, which was organized jointly with Yale University, where
Okun had taught throughout the 1950s. Among its younger
participants, the meeting engendered a certain wonder: It was like
watching a reunion of the 1970s Knicks, said MIT's Frank Levy; or
the '40s Dodgers, the '50s Yankees or the '60s Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it appeared as the economists spoke that the Federal
Reserve Board and the Treasury Department were on the verge of
beating the Camelot record, not merely beating it but eclipsing it,
contriving yet another ``soft landing'' _ this one in the wake of
the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. With the beginning of the
new century, the current expansion will have outlived the 1960s
boom _ previously the longest uninterupted period of growth on
record.
</P>
<P>
   In fact there is a resemblance between the 1960s and the '90s,
at least on the surface of it. Both decades featured Democratic
presidents with strong teams of advisers, highly capable Fed
chairmen, and great prosperity. Indeed, the present Treasury
Secretary, Lawrence Summers, principal economic adviser to
President Clinton, is nephew to Paul Samuelson, who had been
President Kennedy's behind-the-scenes guru. In their wrap-up paper,
George Perry of the Brookings Institution and William Brainerd of
Yale University made the comparson explicit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long expansion of the 1960s was preceded by an era of of
frequent recessions and, before that, the Great Depression that
ended only with World War II,'' they wrote. ``The equally long
expansion of the 1990s was preceded by two decades in which
inflation was a stubborn problem and estimates of attainable
unemployment rates drifted pessimistically higher.''
</P>
<P>
   That argument was demolished in the discussion of it by John
Taylor of Stanford University. He pointed out that such
characterizations of the decades were somewhat misleading: of the
'60s as good, the '70s and '80s as horrible and the '90s good
again.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Taylor said, the relevant period was the almost
uninterupted period of expansion begun in August 1982, punctuated
only by the mild and brief recession of '90-91. ``These are the
longest back-to-back expansions in history,'' said Taylor, and they
had been characterized by consistently falling rates of inflation.
``There is just no other period like it.''
</P>
<P>
   What had changed? The rules for conducting monetary policy
forone thing, opined Taylor, who was prevented by modesty from
saying more. A policy that focuses strictly on price stability
(devised in its intellectual underpinnings in large measure by
Taylor himself) had replaced the more complicated sailing orders of
the Camelot crew.
</P>
<P>
   With the central conceit of the meeting disposed of _ or at
least put aside for another day _ the economists were free to talk
about the really interesting questions, such as what did Kennedy
administration economists know in the early '60s about the
overvalued dolar and when did they know it? The US currency had
begun the decade overvalued; it only got worse as the boom went on.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the erosion of the US balance of trade led to a run
on the dollar that brought to anend the international monetary
system that had existed since World War II. Was there anything the
Kennedy administration could have done to avoid that outcome? And
the decade of slow growth and inflation that followed? The
consensus was that they had done the best they could, given the
political constraints.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent problems preccupied Arthur Okun for the last
dozen years of his life. Paul Samuelson wrote in 1980, ``His reason
and his knowledge made him dubious of mandatory wage-price controls
as a permanent solution. But his econometric research correctly
predicted that contriving a recession to fight inflation would
produce disappointing benefits and staggering human costs.'' When
he died, Okun was working on plan to fight inflation by taxing away
excessive wage and price increases.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the situation turned out to be just the reverse.
An informal balance sheet shows that the human costs of the
recessions of the early '80s were relatively modest, and the
benefits were staggering. Looking back on the second half of the
20th century, we have to conclude that economists associated with
the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Bill Clinton
had a much better run than the Kennedy economists _ apparently
largely because they abandoned not macroeconomics itself, but
rather the earlier set of policy aims.
</P>
<P>
   The economists of the Reagan era were standing on the shoulders
of giants, there can no doubt about it at all. As a result they
enjoyed the standard privilege. They could see farther and do
better than ever had been done before, at least where inflation and
economic growth were concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Samuelson, in his memorial of Okun, wrote, ``He was often wrong,
as all economists turn out to be. But his long-run batting average
was good, and even his wrong judgements were cogently based on such
evidences as could be known in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not a bad things to have said of you. Not a bad thing at
all.

<P>
   Bumpers are routinely tested by Consumer Reports magazine and by
the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a group financed
largely by insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Both organizations buy their test cars directly from
dealerships, as a consumer would. Both make their results available
to the public. And both crash-test bumpers at the old, defunct
government standard of 5 miles an hour _ twice the speed of the
current standard and a pace that the insurance institute likens to
``a brisk walk.'' (Safety engineers say testing at 2.5 mph would be
a waste of time, since that standard is so low.)
</P>
<P>
   In other respects, the insurance institute and Consumer Reports
test differently, and their varied approaches produce different
results.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance institute, of Arlington, Va., conducts four tests.
The front and rear of a vehicle are crashed into a flat barrier.
Then the front is crashed into an angled barrier and the rear is
backed into a pole. The institute rates bumpers as good,
acceptable, marginal and poor, based on the cost of restoring the
bumpers to original condition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Reports bashes bumpers as part of a battery of auto
tests at its test track in East Haddam, Conn., and it includes the
results in its road-test reports. It uses a hydraulic
bumper-basher, which looks like a battering ram, to hit the bumper
three times in the front and three in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Each end of each vehicle is subjected to a 5 mph impact in the
center, an offset 5 mph impact to the left of center, and a 3 mph
impact to the right corner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The magazine compiles the overall cost to repair each bumper
after it has been hit three times, not the cost of each hit. The
results are reported in the magazine and on its Web site,
www.ConsumerReports.org, which requires a $3.95 monthly
subscription.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance institute reports the costs separately for each of
its four hits, plus it reports the total damage and the average
damage for each hit. Its results are posted on the Internet at
www.highwaysafety.org.
</P>
<P>
   The different testing methods produce different outcomes.
Sometimes the dollar difference is only $100 or $200. That,
however, was not the case with the 1999 Mazda Protege. It incurred
$4,609 in damages in the insurance institute's tests and just $960
in damage from Consumer Reports.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the agency
responsible for auto safety compliance, does not have a continuing
program to insure that cars comply with the 2.5 mph standard.
Officials say that is because it devotes its limited resources to
testing life-saving systems in front and side crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Where does this leave the consumer doing research on a car?
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking for a vehicle that has no damage in either test,''
advised Clarence Ditlow, head of the Center for Auto Safety. ``Any
vehicle that suffers more than $900 of damage is not a vehicle that
you want to buy.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say the important thing, regardless of whose
data is used, is to compare a vehicle with others in its class.
</P>
<P>
   In Consumer Reports' testing, other cars the size of the Protege
suffered damage ranging from $129 for a Saturn to $399 for an
Oldsmobile Alero, said David Champion, director of auto testing for
the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Brian O'Neill, of the insurance institute, said: ``Don't fixate
on the $4,000. There's the Protege with a bad bumper and a New
Beetle in the same class with a very good bumper. In all four
low-speed tests, damage to the New Beetle totaled only $134.'' &QL;

<P>
   Pity the urban bumper, always getting pushed around. It gets
scraped by cabs jostling for a head start; it gets whacked by
drivers who parallel-park not by sight, but by sound. The battle
scars are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it bumper rash,'' said Mike Porcelli, who owns Central
Avenue Collision Works in New York City. In his 50 years in the
auto body business Porcelli has seen the damages mount, thanks to
plastic-faced bumpers and an increase in leasing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago we had metal or chrome bumpers,'' Porcelli said.
``They could get dinged, dented and twisted. We could straighten
them out and polish them and they were fine for most purposes. Now
you have plastic bumpers. They get gouged and torn up. They are
more easily damaged, and they are more expensive to repair.''
</P>
<P>
   Repairing a Taurus bumper that has relatively little damage,
like small cuts, could cost $400, according to the New York State
Auto Collision Technician's Association. Replacing the bumper with
a new one made by Ford could run $700. Repairing the slightly
larger bumper of a Saturn S-Series could cost $600, compared with
$750 for replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Leasing also affects people's decisions to make repairs. While
car owners can choose to live with scratches and dings, those whose
leases are ending cannot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to either pay the leasing company at the time they
turn it in or they have to pay us or somebody else to fix it,''
Porcelli said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because bumper rash occurs over time, with each nick unlikely to
exceed the insurance deductible, the consumer bears the cost of
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Porcelli says he talks customers out of fixing damage the first
time a bumper on a leased car is scratched. ``They'll get hit six
more times before they have to turn the car in,'' he said. ``In
that time, if they're lucky, maybe it will get hit in a spot that
needed the work and the insurance company will pay.''

 &HT;    Support for tradition still alive after bonfire tragedy
 &HT;    By Laylan Copelin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ As the last of the collapsed Aggie
bonfire was cleared Friday and set aside as evidence, Texas A&AMP;M
President Ray Bowen began trying to balance a popular desire to
continue the tradition with the need for a credible investigation
into the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from the site where 11 people died when the 40-foot
stack of
</P>
<P>
   logs toppled early Thursday morning, Bowen said he had heard
many Aggies
</P>
<P>
   express a desire for the tradition that began in 1909 to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's in the heart of everybody,'' he said. ``But at
this point
</P>
<P>
   of time, not understanding exactly what happened, it would be
best if we
</P>
<P>
   sort of left out on the table the possibility after a full
analysis we'll have to make the hard decision that this would be
the last bonfire.''
</P>
<P>
   The day before, Bowen had talked about the university leading
its own
</P>
<P>
   investigation with outside help. On Friday, however, Bowen
acknowledged
</P>
<P>
   the investigative task force would need outside leadership to
give the results credibility with the parents of the students
killed and injured as well as others outside the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could not be led by someone that would be perceived,
rightly or wrongly perceived, somehow protective of our interest,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen did not say who would lead such an investigation, although
he said
</P>
<P>
   the individual would have to understand higher education,
government and big business as well as the legal, technical and
political issues involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe a former university president,'' Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen said federal OSHA officials already had visited the site
and he
</P>
<P>
   would welcome other outside experts, including the Texas
Rangers, if
</P>
<P>
   they felt they could contribute. He said he would not tackle the
make-up
</P>
<P>
   of the investigation task force until next week in what he said
he hopes
</P>
<P>
   will be a calmer climate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, A&AMP;M officials said the video camera that provided
real-time
</P>
<P>
   images of the construction of the bonfire on the university's
Web site did not record the collapse. They asked anyone who might
have copied that image or eyewitnesses who might have taken
photographs or video to contact them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be important information,'' Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the A&AMP;M community was still mourning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have all the answers to the questions,'' Bowen said.
``We're
</P>
<P>
   still dealing with the shock.''
</P>
<P>
   At 2:25 a.m. Friday morning, almost 24 hours to the minute from
the
</P>
<P>
   collapse, the last of the tree trunks and smaller logs were
cleared and stacked on the Polo Field. Workers were fencing the
site Friday to protect the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The center pole, the primary support for what was to be a
55-foot bonfire, is expected to be the a focus of any
investigation. The pole is actually two pine poles _ pressured
treated _ that are spliced together. It is then buried 15 feet into
the ground and stands 85 feet high during the construction of the
bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   Pulleys and ropes are attached to the pole and used to lift the
logs onto the six layers of the bonfire stack. There were four
layers at the time of the collapse. Most of the fatalities,
officials said, appeared to be the people working on the higher
stacks.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Thompson, the faculty bonfire adviser, said the center
pole was snapped in two or three places. Although some of the 70
students on the bonfire stack reported hearing a sharp crack,
Thompson said he still
</P>
<P>
   believes the center pole cracked as the entire pile toppled.
Thompson was not at the scene when the crash occurred but said he
based his opinion on talks he had with student workers.
</P>
<P>
   He said the damage to the center pole, which is 3 to 4 feet in
diameter, was above and below where the pole is spliced together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The splice was intact,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   To splice the two poles, four foot-long joints are cut in each,
then bolted
</P>
<P>
   together. Thompson said 700 feet of 3/4 inch steel cable is
wrapped
</P>
<P>
   8 to 10 feet above and below the splice.
</P>
<P>
   Experts, including structural engineers, also are expected to
</P>
<P>
   investigate the size of the logs, the system of using bailing
wire to
</P>
<P>
   wrap each log to three others, and other construction methods
developed
</P>
<P>
   over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no blueprint as such,'' Thompson said. ``The Aggie
bonfire is
</P>
<P>
   really hand-down tradition from generation to generation.
There's a lot
</P>
<P>
   of on-the-job training. It's almost like an apprenticeship.''
</P>
<P>
   While the crane operators are professionals and Thompson is a
faculty adviser, almost all of the other work _ from felling the
cedar and oak
</P>
<P>
   trees to building the stack _ is organized, managed and overseen
by
</P>
<P>
   students.
</P>
<P>
   The bonfire was to be 55 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation also will focus on the training and management
of the
</P>
<P>
   work.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time the bonfire stack has collapsed or
safety questions have been raised.
</P>
<P>
   The stack fell in 1957 and 1994. The latter, which did not
seriously injure anyone, was blamed on saturated ground from heavy
rains. After the investigation, Thompson said lime was added to the
base to harden the ground but construction methods were not
changed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, a student-faculty study recommended better protection
for
</P>
<P>
   workers' eyes and ears, eliminating the consumption of alcohol
and reducing the height of the bonfire. The height recommendation,
proposed to save wood, was never adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who has been faculty bonfire adviser since 1990,
denied
</P>
<P>
   rumors that students were horse-playing at the time of the
collapse or
</P>
<P>
   that a crane hit the stack.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that the bonfire stack did not fall apart as it
toppled to one side. He said the heavy, redundant wire wrappings
kept the stack mostly intact: ``It didn't just fall apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson echoed the opinions of many others: ``As a former
student I'd
</P>
<P>
   hate to see the tradition die.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``I definitely don't want to do this again without
answers'' as to why it happened.

TRADE PACT WITH CHINA: HOLD THE APPLAUSE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (Eds: The questions may be italicized) 
(af) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than 100 years, American business has been bewitched by
the size and potential of China. The experience, of course, has
been a rocky one. But the dreams live on.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are not immune, either.
</P>
<P>
   In the glow of the trade liberalization agreement that the
United States struck with China last week _ a necessary condition
for China's entry into the World Trade Organization _ many Chinese
stocks have surged on major American exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   The trade deal is good news, but the market's reaction may be
premature and, some experts say, overdone.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 21 months, Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, has traveled to China eight times. Last
week, he took some time to put the trade agreement into
perspective. Following are excerpts from the conversation: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The United States is China's biggest single trading partner,
but this country exports only about $15 billion of goods and
services there each year. If this deal is approved by Congress,
should people expect that number to skyrocket? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Even if exports doubled, which they will not, it is not a
watershed event. It's pretty clear that a year from now we will not
be celebrating the end of the U.S. trade deficit as we know it.
This agreement is generally a constructive development, but not one
of instant gratification for investors around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly the most important conclusion I would take from this is
that it is really a watershed event for Chinese economic reform.
And it offers a real chance that we will be able to participate in
what is likely to be the greatest economic development story of the
21st century. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Aside from trade, is it likely that foreign direct investment
in China will rise as a result of the agreement? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think foreign direct investment will go up a lot. So far
this year, it has slumped compared to 1998: through October, about
$32 billion in direct investment, compared with $46 billion a year
earlier. To a large extent, that is a byproduct of the Asian
crisis, which has acted as a disincentive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What sorts of companies are likely to benefit most rapidly
from trade liberalization? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The telecom area will be a real opportunity immediately.
Anything with a technology content to it has demand for it. Given
the lack of infrastructure, the wireless opportunities are truly
extraordinary. I go to China a lot, and almost everyone in Beijing
or Shanghai has a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities in financial services may not emerge quite so
promptly, but it is hard to say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. To what extent is the publicity surrounding this deal masking
the difficulties companies will face in trying to break into
China? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There will clearly be sentiment in some quarters to avoid
giving too much away to foreigners. But the Chinese leadership has
demonstrated they are pretty determined to play by the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the culture of bureaucratic corruption, which is
something I have heard about but not seen, is not something that
gets broken overnight. And there is no mistaking the depth and
breadth of the bureaucratic culture in a managed economy. There is
nothing foolproof here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In order for China to gain acceptance into the WTO, Congress,
European nations and Canada must approve. Will they? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Seven months ago, when the deal fell through, the political
forces were struck against a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But now there is an increased likelihood of congressional
approval. And I think the Europeans will definitely follow suit.
The economics are just too compelling not to do this. It is
basically a win-win proposition to have greater access to the
world's most populous economy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will this give WTO members a boost at the next round of trade
liberalization talks that will start in Seattle later this month? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think it is really important for the Seattle talks, because
it will have a significant impact on the tone of the discussions.
As a successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, WTO
has been in search of an identity. Managing the accession of China
will be very important to it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will trade liberalization have an immediate impact on China's
economic growth? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Throughout most of the 1990s, the Chinese economy, which is
about $1 trillion in size, has been growing at about 10 percent a
year. This year it will grow around 7 percent, and it could expand
at an 8 percent or 8.5 percent rate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Admission into the WTO won't hurt growth, but it won't help much
either over the next year or so. Over time, say the next three to
five years, you will begin to see some meaningful growth, probably
driven by foreign direct investment, but also by Chinese consumers,
who have been on the sidelines.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alexander Liberman, the dominant creative force at Conde Nast
Publications for more than half a century and one of the most
influential and glamorous editors in America, died Friday at Mount
Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. He was 87 and had homes in New
York and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Russian-born Liberman considered himself first an
artist and second a magazine editor and designer, it was his
extraordinary career at Conde Nast, first as art director for Vogue
and later as editorial director for all the company's magazines,
that gave him his power and reach. From the time he arrived at
Vogue in 1941, having just fled occupied France, he brought a
modern sensibility to fashion journalism that would remain with him
through his life.
</P>
<P>
   His determination to replace the hauteur of Vogue with a sense
of freedom and informality helped change the way American women saw
themselves. He wanted to embolden design and to break away from
artifice, so he brought in younger photographers who shot outdoors
in natural light. ``No more Ophelias dancing through the Plaza at
dawn,'' he said. In time, as Amy Spindler, now the style editor of
The New York Times Magazine, observed, ``No man in the Western
world held more power over the fashion images men and women saw
than Liberman during his tenure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the highly volatile world of big-time magazine publishing,
where editors and art directors are as expendable as first wives,
it was astonishing that anyone had managed to stay on top as long
as Alex had,'' Dodie Kazanjian and Calvin Tomkins wrote in their
1993 biography, ``Alex.'' ``One possible explanation was that there
had never been a clearly definable Liberman style, no signature
look to the magazines he directed, nothing you can point to and
decide was out-of date. The Liberman style was protean and
infinitely renewable. He had always pushed for journalistic variety
at the expense of anything that smacked of an art director's
concept of `good design.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He responded so intuitively and so sensitively to changes of
every kind _ changes in social attitudes as well as changes in
photography and art and visual communication _ that he always
seemed to be one or two jumps ahead of everyone else in his field,
and because of this, the magazines he directed stayed fresh and
innovative and very much alive.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Vogue, the magazines published by Conde Nast over
the years were Vanity Fair, Glamour, House &AMP; Garden (known for a
period as HG), Mademoiselle, Bride's, GQ, Self, Gourmet, Conde Nast
Traveler, Woman, Details, Allure, Architectural Digest and Bon
Appetit. Liberman also had a word or two to say about The New
Yorker after it was taken over by Advance Publications, the parent
company of Conde Nast.
</P>
<P>
   An elegant, courtly man who always wore gray suits to the office
with pale blue shirts and narrow hand-knit navy silk ties, Liberman
inspired both adulation and terror among editors and art directors.
From 1960 to 1994, in his position as editorial director of all
Conde Nast magazines, he had the final word on virtually all
editorial matters from captions to covers. Some editors loved
working with him, appreciating the sureness of his judgment and the
authority of his eye, as well as his constant desire to experiment.
Others _wary of his famous icy glance _ quaked as he tore up
layouts and substituted covers at the last minute. ``Dear friend,''
he would say, ``don't you think it might be better this way?''
</P>
<P>
   Several editors and art directors learned to their dismay that
the price of disagreeing with the Silver Fox, as Liberman was known
within the company, could be dismissal from Conde Nast, although he
himself never did the firing and differences with him were rarely
stated as the reason for the dismissals. He had many favorites and
proteges over the years, but his loyalty was not to those who
worked for him but to those for whom he worked.
</P>
<P>
   One of his protegees was Grace Mirabella, who succeeded Diana
Vreeland, the legendary editor in chief of Vogue, after the
extravagant and uncontrollable Mrs. Vreeland was asked to step down
in 1971. Ms. Mirabella and Liberman both understood that after the
excesses of the 1960s, American women were looking for ``real
life'' fashion. The new young editor and the older editorial
director quickly established an excellent working relationship,
even though Liberman had the final approval of every article, every
layout, every cover and even every cover line in Ms. Mirabella's
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very good at giving confidence,'' Ms. Mirabella told
Ms. Kazanjian and Tomkins. ``He was an incredibly modern person
with constant curiosity about everything and not a shred of
nostalgia. I hated it when he went away in the summer. I didn't
trust anyone else's eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus Ms. Mirabella reacted with incredulity to a call from her
husband, who was watching television in June 1988 and had just
heard a gossip columnist's report that Anna Wintour, the editor in
chief of HG, would be taking over as editor in chief of Vogue.
Certain that her friend Liberman would have warned her if this had
been in the works, Ms. Mirabella went directly to his office and
asked him about the report. ``Yes,'' he said. ``I'm afraid it's
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberman's remarkable tenure stemmed in great part from the
close personal and working relationships he established with the
succession of men who headed the company, starting with Conde Nast
himself. The closest of these relationships was with S.I. Newhouse
Jr., who started work in 1961 in the company acquired by his father
the previous decade and who was appointed chairman in 1975. For
more than 30 years Newhouse and Liberman discussed every aspect of
the business, including starting up and acquiring magazines,
redesigning and revamping them and hiring and firing editors and
art directors. In a note to Liberman on his 80th birthday, Newhouse
referred to their relationship as ``the most meaningful experience
of my life.''

 &HT;    Abuses alleged at Georgia youth home
 &HT;    By Ron Martz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIDALIA, Ga. _ Troubled youths at a Vidalia group home owned by
pro football Hall of Famer Mel Blount were frequently beaten by
staff members with rubber hoses, flashlights, sticks and brooms,
according to a report released Friday by the state Department of
Juvenile Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The home had teachers who were not certified and a counselor who
lied about his educational background, and it frequently fed the
residents hot dogs or bologna three times a day instead of balanced
meals, the investigation found.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were outlined in a letter from DJJ Commissioner
Orlando Martinez to officials at the Mel Blount Youth Home,
notifying them that their contract with the state was being
terminated. The home remains open with children from other states
while the Georgia Department of Human Resources, which licenses
group homes, investigates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be well understood that our standards of dealing
with kids do not include abusing them,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez ordered 20 Georgia youths removed from the home Sept. 7
when the abuse allegations surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   The state has been sending boys to the home since 1983, when it
was opened shortly after Blount, an All-Pro cornerback with the
Pittsburgh Steelers, retired. Blount, a native of Vidalia, has a
similar home in Pennsylvania, which also has been the target of
abuse allegations. The Georgia home is managed by his brother,
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Blount could not be reached for comment Friday, but Clinton
Blount denied all the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never done anything that is harmful to a child. We are
very proud of our success rate and the rate of improvement these
kids make here on a daily basis,'' Blount said.
</P>
<P>
   The home is on a 270-acre farm seven miles south of Vidalia.
Youths ages 11 to 19 who have been in trouble with the law are sent
there to live and work.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to youngsters from Georgia, the home accepts
troubled youths from Florida and Kansas, 17 of whom are still in
residence, Blount said.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Martinez said investigators found that staff
member Annie Jackson, math teacher James McNear and Clinton Blount
were involved in the abuse of as many as 12 youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resident Jeremy B. reports that Mr. Blount hit Jeremy in the
back and head with a stick. Jeremy also reports that Mr. Blount hit
him with a rubber hose on the back, knees, and arms. Resident
Antonio C. reports that Mr. Blount hit Antonio in the head with a
flashlight for wetting the bed,'' Martinez wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the abuse, Martinez said investigators found that
McNear and reading teacher Sandra Little are not certified and that
counselor Russia Little lied about his educational background.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Blount would not comment on specific charges but said:
``We have never had any situation of the nature mentioned (in the
letter). We take hard-core kids and such allegations are
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Toombs County District Attorney Richard Malone also could not be
reached for comment Friday. But Malone said earlier this week that
the DHR had initially taken allegations of abuse at the home to the
Georgia Bureau of Investigation. The GBI did not open a formal
investigation, and Malone said the allegations he saw were not
specific. He described what he saw as ``peer discipline'' and was
not aware of what DJJ investigators uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said the home was also the subject of abuse charges in
1994 but they were not substantiated.

 UNDATED: my life.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was not only the magazine business that forged the bond
between Liberman and Newhouse, but their shared passion for art as
well. Newhouse, an avid collector of postwar American art, could
often be seen ducking into Liberman's office, art catalog in hand,
to seek advice. The two men regularly visited art galleries during
lunchtime to look at possible acquisitions. They lunched together
at least once a week and Liberman introduced his boss to some of
the leading members of the New York art world.
</P>
<P>
   Liberman was eventually recognized by many critics as a
significant painter. But even though his work came to be exhibited
by art dealers like Larry Gagosian, Betty Parsons and Andre
Emmerich, his reputation was always somewhat tainted by his
position at Conde Nast. Some critics found it difficult not to be
dismissive of an artist who was so prominent a figure in the world
of glitz and commerce. ``Although long ago he earned the right to
be ranked among the most original and genuinely creative talents of
our time, many critics have been unable to forget or forgive the
fact that part of Liberman's life is devoted to the world of high
fashion,'' the critic Lawrence Campbell once wrote in ArtNews. His
hiring of art critics for Vogue and the sheer power of the Conde
Nast publications also raised questions about potential conflicts
of interest.
</P>
<P>
   His artistic sensibility, in turn, transformed Vogue into a
serious forum for contemporary art. He published features on
Giacometti, Utrillo, Matisse, Braque, Duchamp and others and
included essays in almost every issue by important art critics. He
also brought in photographers like Irving Penn, William Klein,
Erwin Blumenfeld, David Bailey, Helmut Newton and Anthony
Armstrong-Jones. And after a long courtship Richard Avedon was
lured away from Vogue's leading rival, Harper's Bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   Liberman was born in Kiev, Ukraine, on Sept. 4, 1912, to a
wealthy timber merchant and his wife, and lived a coddled,
luxurious life until the Russian Revolution erupted in 1917. Life
became so stressful that when Alex was 9 his father asked to take
the boy with him on a trade mission to London; the request was
taken up before the Politburo and received the approval of Lenin.
</P>
<P>
   The young Alex spent the next three years in London and attended
English boarding schools, where he learned good table manners,
self-discipline and the English language, all of which would serve
him well for the rest of his life. In 1924 he moved with his mother
to Paris, where he lived on and off for the next 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   He studied painting and architecture at the Ecole des Beaux Arts
and began his journalistic career at Vu, a photographic newsweekly
and prototype of Life magazine. It was owned by Lucien Vogel, who
would one day introduce him to Conde Nast. In 1936 he married
Hildegarde Sturm, a German model and skiing champion. A year later
she walked out on him and they were eventually divorced.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938 Liberman was reintroduced to Tatiana Iacovleva du
Plessix, a blond Russian emigre he had known when he was younger.
The two soon became lovers. Two years later her husband, Count
Bertrand du Plessix, an early Resistance hero in World War II, was
killed when his plane was shot down. A beautiful and imperious
woman who had once been engaged to the Russian poet Vladimir
Mayakovsky, she had survived starvation when she was a girl by
reciting Pushkin to Bolshevik soldiers in return for potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing the Nazis, Liberman, Tatiana and her 10-year-old
daughter, Francine, escaped through Spain and Portugal and sailed
to New York in 1941. Liberman immediately set forth to look for a
job. It was one of the many moments in his life when he found
himself torn between art and commerce, having to decide whether to
pursue his muse or to find employment that would enable him to
provide for Tatiana's and Francine's needs. The decision came down,
as it always would, on the side of money. His years as a refugee
had given him a deep respect for comfort and security as well as a
desire for luxury.
</P>
<P>
   Through Vogel, now a consultant at Conde Nast, Liberman went to
work in the art department of Vogue for Fehmy Agha, the formidable
art director of Conde Nast. At the end of the first week Agha
dismissed the newcomer, saying he was not right for Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Liberman returned to his hotel to find a message that Conde Nast
himself had agreed to see him. This time he brought with him a
certificate for a prize for magazine design he had won at the
Universal Exposition in Paris in 1937, but said nothing about his
previous week's work at Vogue. Nast summoned Agha and informed him
that Liberman had just been hired to work for Vogue. ``Yes, Mr.
Nast,'' Agha replied and never mentioned the subject again.

 UNDATED: subject again. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was, of course, the start of a legendary career that brought
Liberman not only recognition and wealth but also enabled him to
marry Tatiana, who became a hat designer for Henri Bendel and then
for Saks Fifth Avenue, as Tatiana of Saks.
</P>
<P>
   They entertained endlessly in their town house on the Upper East
Side and in later years at their weekend house in northwestern
Connecticut, thanks to a generous expense account at Conde Nast.
Their guests included Marlene Dietrich, Joseph Brodsky, Mikhail
Baryshnikov, Elsa Maxwell, Salvador Dali, Charles Addams, Claudette
Colbert, John Gunther, Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, Princess
Margaret and the Earl of Snowdon. In addition to the artists,
writers and critics, there were as many Russian emigres and titled
Europeans as Tatiana could gather.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hectic life and left little time for painting.
Nonetheless, Liberman, determined to be a serious artist, doggedly
pursued his painting on weekends. All through the 1950s, he created
geometric circle paintings: circles within circles, circle
cut-outs, circles in industrial lacquer on aluminum panels.
</P>
<P>
   By 1962 he had begun to create large-scale paintings with
splashes and streaks of color. He abandoned circles and flung paint
from buckets onto canvases laid out on the floor. Sometimes he used
floor mops instead of brushes. His paintings became larger and more
somber, then wilder and more extravagant. By the 1980s he was using
charcoal crayon on acrylic paint with the crayon pushed so hard it
would break; the pieces were incorporated into the painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more I rebel, maybe even because I work in a magazine
that surrounds itself with civilized behavior, taste and so
forth,'' he told Barbara Rose, the Vogue art critic who wrote a
monograph on his work in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   If his paintings were huge, his sculptures were monumental.
Cleve Gray, an artist who had married Francine du Plessix, who
became an author of fiction and nonfiction, turned over a barn on
his property in Connecticut for use as a studio and Liberman began
cutting up and welding discarded pieces of farm machinery until he
filled a field with 25 or 30 jagged pieces of sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   The critics were far more receptive to his sculpture than his
painting. Commissions poured in. Liberman's sculptures, fashioned
from gas storage tanks and old boilers, appear in parks, shopping
malls and college campuses throughout this country and abroad,
making him one of the most prolific public sculptors of his time.
The Museum of Modern Art placed one of his sculptures in its
garden. Nelson Rockefeller commissioned one for the family estate
at Pocantico Hills. Robert Hughes, art critic at Time and a Vogue
contributor, called these welded-steel sculptures Liberman's most
important work, describing them as ``of real importance in recent
American sculpture.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberman was also a serious photographer. In the 1940s and '50s,
he photographed Braque, Matisse, Utrillo, Rouault, Brancusi,
Chagall and Picasso, among others, for a book of photo essays,
``The Artist in His Studio.'' He was also the author of ``Greece,
Gods and Art''; ``Marlene: An Intimate Photographic Memoir,'' about
Marlene Dietrich; ``Campidoglio,'' a book of photographs taken over
20 years showing the Roman capitol designed by Michelangelo; and
``Then: 1925-1995,'' a retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 his wife, Tatiana, died. The next year he married
Melinda Pechangco, the nurse who had attended Tatiana in her last
illness. In addition to his wife and stepdaughter, of Warren,
Conn., Liberman is survived by two stepgrandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about when Liberman would retire as editorial
director had been a favorite topic in the magazine business for
years. In 1984 he relinquished one of the most powerful titles in
American journalism after 31 years, and was named deputy chairman
for editorial of Conde Nast. He was succeeded by James Truman, the
British-born editor in chief of Details, a Conde Nast publication
that under his leadership had become the hot magazine for hip young
men.
</P>
<P>
   In their ``American Magazine'' (1991), a 250-year history of
American magazines, the authors Amy Janello and Brennon Jones sum
up the contributions of Alexander Liberman in these words: ``For
almost 50 years, he has had _ and continues to have _ an
incalculable effect on the taste and the visual temper of our
time.''

HIGH COURT WILL ASSESS CONSTITUTIONALITY OF WHISTLEBLOWER LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt.)   (bl)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Greatly expanding the scope of a case to be argued
only 9 days from now, the Supreme Court announced Friday that it
would decide whether the central portion of the federal
whistleblower law is constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said in a highly unusual late-day order that they
would decide whether the Constitution permits private citizens to
be given standing to litigate claims of fraud against the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since 1863, when Congress passed the False Claims Act in
response to widespread fraud against the government by contractors
during the Civil War, individuals have been eligible for
substantial bounties of up to one-quarter of the money recovered
for bringing a successful lawsuit on the government's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The issue in the case to be argued before the court Nov. 29 had
been a limited one: whether Congress meant to make states liable as
defendants under the False Claims Act and, if so, whether states
were entitled under the 11th Amendment to immunity from such suits.
The case, Vermont Agency of Natural Resources vs. United States,
No. 98-1828, began as a suit by a Vermont state employee alleging
that his agency had submitted false claims under a federal grant
program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether the plaintiff, Jonathan Stevens, had
standing to bring the case was not presented to the court, and the
justices gave no indication Friday of why they decided to add this
fundamental question to the case.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely explanation was that on Monday of this week, the
5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans declared in an
unrelated case that private lawsuits under the False Claims Act,
known as qui tam actions, were unconstitutional. The two judges in
the majority on the three-judge panel found that the private
lawsuits in the name of the government violated the constitutional
separation of powers as well as the provision that the executive
branch ``take care that the laws are faithfully executed.'' In
addition, a concurring opinion by one of the two judges said that
private citizens, in the absence of personal injury, simply lack
standing to sue.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of standing to bring a lawsuit in federal court is
of constitutional dimension because Article III of the
Constitution, which established the judicial branch, limited
federal courts' jurisdiction to ``cases'' or ``controversies,''
language that the Supreme Court has interpreted to require
plaintiffs generally to have suffered personal, concrete and
ongoing injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The False Claims Act has been challenged on this ground over the
years, but has been upheld in every other court. The panel's
opinion this week was such a departure that the 5th Circuit
promptly vacated it and ordered the case reheard in January by the
full appeals court. Despite that development, the justices may have
been convinced that the issue would reach them in the near future
and that it would make sense to turn the narrower Vermont case into
a vehicle for addressing it right away.

TEAMSTERS' FORMER POLITICAL DIRECTOR CONVICTED OF FRAUD,
CONSPIRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal jury in Manhattan on Friday convicted the
former political director of the Teamsters union on fraud and
conspiracy charges, concluding that he helped divert union money to
finance the re-election campaign of the union's former president,
Ron Carey.
</P>
<P>
   The jury reached its verdict after a four-week trial in which
the prosecutors connected the official, William Hamilton, to a
scheme in which $885,000 in union money was funneled to aid Carey's
struggling 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, which deliberated for nearly two days, found Hamilton
guilty on all six counts, including conspiracy, embezzlement, fraud
and perjury. Hamilton faces up to 30 years in prison when he is
sentenced Feb. 29 by Judge Thomas Griesa of U.S. District Court in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Five people have pleaded guilty to participating in the scheme,
but Hamilton was the first person to be tried in a scandal that has
rocked the Teamsters, one of the nation's most powerful and
prominent unions.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's lawyer, G. Robert Gage Jr., said, ``We intend to
pursue a vigorous appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than two weeks, the prosecution presented evidence
seeking to show that Hamilton had cooperated with several Carey
campaign consultants to use union money as a vehicle to get people
outside the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to donate money
to the Carey campaign. Carey narrowly defeated James P. Hoffa in
the 1996 election, but federal monitors overturned his victory
after uncovering the campaign finance fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecution witnesses described a scheme in which the Teamsters
union donated $735,000 to Citizen Action and two other liberal
groups, and in return wealthy donors to those groups contributed
$200,000 to the Carey campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law bars using union money to advance the campaign of a
union official.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The prosecution also presented evidence that Hamilton and
several Carey campaign aides had agreed to have the Teamsters
donate $1 million to various Democratic Party committees if party
officials found a Democratic donor to give at least $50,000 to the
Carey campaign. Democratic officials failed to find such a donor,
and the Teamsters never gave the $1 million to the Democrats,
although the union contributed $300,000 to the Democrats in what
Teamster and party officials said had nothing to do with a swap
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, the former finance director of the Democratic
National Committee, Richard Sullivan, testified that President
Clinton's friend and fund-raiser Terence McAuliffe had worked to
advance this scheme. McAuliffe's lawyer, Richard Ben-Veniste, said
his client had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Carey's campaign manager, Jere Nash, and his
direct-mail consultant, Martin Davis, pleaded guilty to
participating in the campaign finance fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In Hamilton's trial, the prosecutors, Robert Rice and Martine
Beamon, argued that he had worked closely with Nash to time
Teamster contributions to the liberal groups so they coincided with
contributions that those groups' donors made to Carey.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing argument, Gage asserted that Nash, the
prosecution's main witness, was not credible because he was a
convicted felon who could obtain a lesser sentence by cooperating
with the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Gage also argued that Hamilton was a victim of a manipulative
scheme hatched by Davis. Davis, he contended, knew that Hamilton
planned to make large donations to several liberal groups and the
Democrats and as a result, Davis parlayed that knowledge into
seeking campaign contributions from donors to those groups.
</P>
<P>
   Gage presented several witnesses who praised Hamilton's
character. He said Hamilton, 57, had spent many years working for
civil rights and abortion rights and had more recently fought ``the
Gingrich Congress'' and Republican attempts to undercut workers'
rights. He argued that the donations that Hamilton ordered to
liberal groups and the Democratic Party were meant to advance those
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a schemer,'' Gage said. ``He is someone who has
spent his entire life working for causes and issues that he has
believed in and doing it in an honest, direct and straightforward
manner.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, witnesses provided little evidence showing
that Carey had been involved in the fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But witnesses furnished considerably more information about
AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer Richard Trumka. Several witnesses
indicated that Trumka had worked with Hamilton in an arrangement in
which the Teamsters made an unusual $150,000 payment to the
AFL-CIO, and then the labor federation immediately contributed
$150,000 to Citizen Action.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors suggested that this was part of a scheme to get
Citizen Action's donors to give money to the Carey campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Trumka, who has not been charged in the case, has invoked the
Fifth Amendment in refusing to talk to congressional committee and
a grand jury. His lawyer, Nicole Seligman, has denied that Trumka
did anything improper. &QL;

STUDENT WAS AN AGGIE FIRST AND LAST, FRIEND SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARY DOCLAR 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARROLLTON, Texas _ Even before he entered Texas A&AMP;M as a
freshman this fall, Michael Ebanks was an Aggie at heart.
</P>
<P>
   The Newman Smith High School graduate often talked about the
storied history of the College Station campus, and he longed to
partake in cherished traditions such as the annual bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He very much wanted to be involved in every tradition,'' said
his best friend, Matt Shomer.
</P>
<P>
   Ebanks, 19, was killed as he lived out that dream, crushed
beneath a pile of logs along with 10 others when something went
awry as the bonfire framework was assembled. Ebanks was one of the
last students pulled from beneath the log pile early Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Ebanks' older brother, Keith, a Texas A&AMP;M graduate, was killed
in a car accident five years ago, said Shomer's father, Ivan. Their
parents, Gerald and Bulinda, also have a married daughter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once is a nightmare for any parents,'' Ivan Shomer said. ``To
have it happen twice ... I don't know how they could face two.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebanks' parents drove to College Station on Thursday night and
are expected to return Saturday, a family friend said.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Shomer, 19, who attends the University of North Texas in
Denton and whose family lives next door to the Ebanks family, said
that the Carrollton community is deeply grieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you can do is pray,'' he said. ``He's in a better place.
My thoughts are with the family. You should never outlive your
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Shomer reminisced about his best friend, recalling that one of
their favorite times was a weeklong camping trip in Canada this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to make people laugh,'' Shomer said. ``He liked to be
the center of attention. He loved to brighten any situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Shomer remembered Ebanks as a self-assured teen who wasn't
afraid to take on anything, whether it was getting his pilot's
license before his high school diploma or fixing a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael was a great kid,'' he said. ``He was enthusiastic,
very friendly, very people-oriented. He had a strong belief in his
ability to accomplish things. He would tackle any job.''
</P>
<P>
   At Newman Smith, where Ebanks graduated in May in the top third
of his class, flags flew at half-staff and students collected $700
for a memorial in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   Photos of Ebanks show a tall, good-looking teen who always
seemed to have a smile on his face. Principal Lee Alvoid said
Ebanks once went through the identification photo line several
times because he didn't like the way his photo came out.
</P>
<P>
   One photo shows Ebanks with his blond hair dyed in the school's
green and gold colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was kind of quiet, but funny,'' Alvoid said. ``He had a
real dry sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ebanks was serious about his studies, giving up golf after
two years to concentrate on honors and advanced placement classes,
Alvoid said.
</P>
<P>
   During his senior year, his retail marketing project won first
place in state competition and advanced to national competition,
Alvoid said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at all his strengths ... it's just such wasted
potential,'' she said. ``But he also died doing something he loved.
It was such a dream and goal of his to be an Aggie, and he died in
that service.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebanks' funeral is 10 a.m. Monday at St. Catherine of Siena
Catholic Church in Carrollton, a Fort Worth suburb. A vigil will be
at 7 p.m. Saturday at Rhoton Funeral Home in Carrollton.

 &HT;    Judge orders Coke to release documents
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. has not complied with a court order to
turn over certain documents to the plaintiffs in a racial
discrimination suit, a federal magistrate ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Judge E. Clayton Scofield ordered the
Atlanta-based company to give those documents to the plaintiffs by
Dec. 16 _ exactly six months after they were supposed to be handed
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court is going to enforce the court's order,'' Scofield
said after hearing arguments from both sides at the Atlanta federal
courthouse. ``Coca-Cola would have to agree that there has to be a
(time) limit.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling comes in a case filed by four current and former
employees who allege that Coca-Cola discriminated against
African-American employees in pay, promotions and performance
evaluations. The plaintiffs are seeking class-action status so they
can represent 1,500 other black salaried employees in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has strongly denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday's ruling, there was a lively debate in which
plaintiffs' attorney Jeffrey Bramlett said obtaining some key
information from Coca-Cola was like engaging in ``Chinese water
torture.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the plaintiffs received a computer database from the
company, but they have not received an adequate explanation of how
to read or interpret much of the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``For three months, we've been trying to find out what this data
means,'' Bramlett told the magistrate.
</P>
<P>
   The company, however, argued that it has the monumental task of
providing millions of pages of documents to the plaintiffs in too
short of a time.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney representing the company, Michael Johnston, said
Coca-Cola already has spent 2,000 to 2,500 hours finding and
reviewing more than 1.5 million pages of documents, with lots more
to come. It plans to hand over another 79 boxes to the plaintiffs
next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're acting in good faith, as quickly as we can,'' Johnston
told Scofield.
</P>
<P>
   But Scofield told Johnston the company was not in compliance
with an earlier court order and that it should have tried to get it
modified if it could not comply. In early June, the company was
ordered to give to the plaintiffs by June 16 a ``complete, readable
and usable'' database covering its employment practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect the judge's ruling,'' said Coca-Cola spokesman Ben
Deutsch. ``We will continue the process we have already started and
meet the new deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch said the company believes the magistrate recognized the
difficulties inherent in producing such enormous amounts of
information.
</P>
<P>
   Scofield did not rule on the issue of punishing the company in
this matter.
</P>
<P>
   He also did not rule on a company motion seeking punishment of
the plaintiffs for allegedly failing to try to informally resolve
this issue before filing a formal motion.
</P>
<P>
   The magistrate also did not rule Friday on three other
outstanding issues:
</P>
<P>
   _ Shredding. The plaintiffs contend that Coca-Cola employees
asked that shredders be placed in a special room the company set up
to collect documents for the suit. They also allege that an
eyewitness saw shredders in the room.
</P>
<P>
   The company said there has never been a shredder in that room
and that no relevant documents in the case have ever been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Disputed documents. The plaintiffs allege the company is
unjustifiably withholding 93 key documents from them, including a
report on diversity at Coca-Cola authored by the Carl Ware, head of
the company's Africa division and the highest ranking black
executive at the company.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola contends that it has the legal right to withhold these
documents for several reasons, including its right to study and
improve itself without having to give such information to
plaintiffs' attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   _ Unsealing documents. The company wants to keep some documents
it turned over to the plaintiffs from public view, while the
plaintiffs want those papers to be unsealed.

KERREY CRITICIZES GORE STANCE ON HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAREMONT, N.H. _ Unhappy with the tenor and substance of the
vice president's criticism of Bill Bradley's health care plan,
Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey said Friday that Al Gore is wrong and
would never lead the nation to universal health care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wrong on policy and it's wrong politically,''
Kerrey said in a telephone interview with the Globe. ``It's wrong
for the Democratic Party to have a primary that makes it less
likely to increase the number of Americans on health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, who is supporting Bradley for president, said he is
worried that Gore's charges will scare so many Americans that it
will ultimately prevent Congress from overhauling health care in
any way. He said he is entering the fray because he believes
Bradley needs help defending his plan.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Gore has picked apart his opponent's proposal,
which would eliminate Medicaid, the health insurance program for
the poor and disabled. Bradley would replace Medicaid with vouchers
for people to buy private health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said the plan would disproportionately hurt African
Americans and Latinos, who receive Medicaid benefits, and it would
hurt the 50 percent of all HIV-positive people who get their health
coverage from Medicaid. The vice president contends that private
insurance companies will turn many of these people away, and that
Bradley's subsidy will leave many poor people paying out of pocket
to meet the actual cost of insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, following a talk at the Empire Sheetmetal company in
Manchester, Gore said he believes Bradley is not intentionally
trying to hurt the poor, the disabled, and others who rely on
Medicaid.

   ``I think that his heart's in the right place,'' Gore said. ``I
like him, I respect him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore said Bradley's plan would give two-thirds of the money
spent to people who already have health care, ``many of them
wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not well thought out, it was a mistake, and sooner or
later he's going to have to amend it, change it, or retract it,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey said he believes that Gore's own plan, to provide health
insurance to all children, is an improvement over the status quo.
But he said it is not as good as Bradley's plan, which aims to
insure every American.

RUSSIANS SUFFERING HIGH CASUALTY RATE IN CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With their relentless air and artillery assault on
Chechnya, Russian commanders have convinced their countrymen that
they are winning the war against separatist Islamic militants, but
a look at the numbers tells a different story.
</P>
<P>
   To portray Russia's three-month campaign in the Caucasus as a
success, military officials have consistently described their
losses as minimal _ by their count, 462 dead and 1,485 wounded
since Chechen rebels invaded the neighboring Russian region of
Dagestan in August.
</P>
<P>
   But hundreds of soldiers' deaths have been hidden by Moscow to
keep support high for the war, say independent analysts and some
soldiers. They describe a hit-and-run war that has exacted heavy
losses on advancing troops, but which has gone largely unreported
by the Russian press.
</P>
<P>
   Even according to official figures, the Russian military is
losing roughly 130 men a month in the Caucasus _ a rate comparable
to the monthly death toll of Soviet troops who fought in
Afghanistan during the disastrous 1979-1989 intervention that
helped discredit the Soviet Union's Communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Russians have taken large swaths of Chechen
territory and several major towns, their ground forces have yet to
engage the rebels in a major battle or attempt to take the capital,
Grozny _ where thousands of Russian troops were killed or wounded
in street fighting during Moscow's 1994-1996 campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   That war ended in a humiliating withdrawal by battered Russian
forces, after the Russian public tired of losing its men in a
conflict it could not win. Saying they have learned their lesson,
federal commanders this time are touting tactics that they say have
allowed the army to avoid casualties inherent in ill-prepared
assaults on heavily guarded cities.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Russian leaders refrain from calling the conflict a
war, billing it as a low-intensity ``anti-terrorist operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Russians have been using their huge advantage in
weaponry to mercilessly pound the positions of Chechen rebel
fighters from a distance before sending in the infantry to mop up,
an advance Moscow-based defense analyst Pavel Felgenhauer recently
descrbied as ``more reminiscent of World War I than modern
warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   This approach has earned criticism from Western leaders, who
blame heavy civilian casualties and the flight of over 200,000
refugees on indiscriminate Russian bombardment. But in Russia,
where polls show overwhelming support for this war, the military
has portrayed their offensive as a big success. Brushing off
criticism from the West, Russia has kept up its military operation
in Chechnya. The military carried out 60 air raids Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is simple and allows avoiding losses among the troops,''
said Russian Major General Vladimir Shamanov, commander of federal
troops in Western Chechnya, explaining the Russian strategy earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   There is also evidence that it is not working. The rebels,
lightly armed and heavily outnumbered, have been unable to respond
to the Russian bombardment, and have steadily retreated before the
Russian advance across the northern Chechen plains. This means that
the stated goal of the operation as outlined by Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin _ to eliminate all the rebel fighters _ is not being
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main rebel force has not been defeated or even seriously
encountered by the army,'' Felgenhauer said. Like most independent
analysts, he predicts a difficult and bloody campaign as winter
approaches, and fighting shifts to the mountains in the south. And
there is still the problem of Grozny where the rebels are dug in,
waiting for the Russians to come.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers show that the Russian advance has hardly been a
bloodless affair thus far. Alexander Zhilin, a retired Army colonel
and military analyst for the newspaper Moskovskiye Novosti, said
Russian troops are being killed in ambushes by Chechen rebels
during mop up operations.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Russia's official casualty figures, which place
Russian losses in the hundreds and losses among the Chechen
fighters in the thousands, appear skewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a rule, the attacking side always loses at least three
times as many men as the defending side,'' said Zhilin. ``Here it
is the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Valetina Melnikova of the Soldiers' Mothers Committee, a Russian
non-government organization that monitors military issues, also
doubts the military's casualty figures. During a recent visit to
Mozdok, the main Russian military base in the Caucasus, Melnikov
found hospitals filled with wounded and dead on days when military
spokesman said their were no casualties.
</P>
<P>
   She also alleged that military commanders deliberately delay the
announcement of fatalities, hoping to stave off the negative public
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military count only those who die on the field of battle
as killed,'' Melnikova said. ``If a soldier dies in the hospital,
that is not reported.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the official death toll is 462, you can easily double
that,'' she concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Even with high casualty counts, about 60 percent of the Russian
public supports the campaing, according to polls.
</P>
<P>
   Following an invasion of Dagestan by Chechen-led rebels in
August, and a series deadly of apartment blasts in September that
the Kremlin has repeatedly blamed on those rebels, society's
willingness to accept battle casualties has changed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, every Russian feels themselves threatened by
Chechnya and therefore they are prepared to accept these losses,''
Zhilin said. ``In Afghanistan, or in the first Chechen war,
ordinary people didn't feel threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor are they properly informed. Russian forces have prevented
international aid agencies and foreign media from freely travelling
to areas close to the fighting in Chechnya. The military allows
some Russian media to accompany troops in Chechnya, but their
reports, often bright portrayals of military successes, are subject
to heavy censorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media hasn't brought it to the public's attention that the
losses are in fact high,'' Zhilin said. ``The government has put
together a very effective public relations campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Already that is changing. On Nov. 10, the newspaper Kommersant
suggested that Russian soldiers were dying in much greater numbers
that officials are admitting.
</P>
<P>
   The story was based on interviews with 18 Russia soldiers and
officers wounded in Chechnya and recovering in a Samara hospital.
One Interior Ministry special forces serviceman said that about 70
percent of his 1,200-man brigade had been killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question is how many more have to die before people
start raising the question of whether this war is worth it,'' said
Alan Rousso, director of the Carnegie Center in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Rousso drew a parallel with the American public's initial
support during the Vietnam war, which changed after people began to
equate casualties with the futility of fighting a highly motivated
guerrilla army. The Soviet army had a similar experience fighting
Islamic rebels in Afghanistan. And that is what happened to Russia
in the last Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   Russia may claim a victory when its forces take occupy all of
Chechnya's major towns, but that will not necessarily mean that the
rebels are defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, the Chechens will stage their own mlitary
comeback, whether it's sneak attacks from the hills or something
more pronounced,'' Rousso said, recalling the Chechens' surprise
invasion of Grozny in August 1996 that forced the Russians to
accept a ceasefire. ``The Russian people will then ask whether they
really won.''

</P>
<P>
   The phones of some Wall Street analysts are ringing off the
hook. No, the cause isn't telemarketers _ or even the corporate
merger boom.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they're ringing because some new-economy companies are
posting on their Web sites the names, affiliations and direct phone
numbers of analysts who track them.
</P>
<P>
   This has not endeared the companies to some analysts, who say
they are having to field a growing number of calls from the public.
</P>
<P>
   Companies posting analysts' phone numbers on their Web sites
include Amazon.com, Priceline.com., TriQuint Semiconductor and
TelCom Semiconductor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was horrified at first,'' said Drew Peck, a semiconductor
analyst for S.G. Cowen &AMP; Co., who said at least a half dozen
companies had posted his name on their sites. To his knowledge,
just one, TriQuint, includes his phone number. But that's plenty
for Peck, who said he and other analysts were increasingly
screening calls. ``Nobody answers their own phones anymore,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lise Buyer, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, whose name
and direct-dial number are listed on Amazon.com's site, agreed. She
said she was relying on an assistant, and voice mail, to screen
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Winn, chief financial officer of TriQuint, said he had not
heard complaints from any analysts. ``We're just trying to make
things easier for investors,'' he said.

   Paying the Price For Avoiding Japan &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just a couple of years ago, life was easy for managers of
foreign stock funds. If they wanted to beat a common benchmark _
the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe, Australasia, Far
East index, or EAFE _ all they had to do was underweight holdings
in Japanese stocks.
</P>
<P>
   That is because Japanese stocks performed dismally from the
early 1990s through last year. The index generally carries a big
weighting of Japanese equities _ 23 percent at latest count.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Nikkei-225 stock index was up 35 percent through
October, and some hot-performing funds that steered clear of Japan
are paying for that decision. A recent study by Morningstar Inc.,
the financial publisher in Chicago, shows how some of the foreign
stock funds that performed best for the five years ending in 1998,
because of their light exposure to Japan, are suddenly lagging
behind other funds in their category.
</P>
<P>
   The four funds cited _ United International Growth, Vanguard
International Growth, BT Investment International and Harbor
International Growth _ all had a far lower percentage of their
holdings in Japanese stocks than their peers, based on their latest
reporting periods.
</P>
<P>
   All finished in the top 20 percent of their category for the
five years through 1998. But all fell well into the bottom half of
their category this year through Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The study also cited funds that are in the top 20 percent of
their peers based on 1999 performance, but were holding relatively
small percentages of Japanese stocks _ Oakmark International, SoGen
Overseas, Artisan International and Templeton Foreign.
</P>
<P>
   The report credited the funds' focuses on emerging-markets and
small-capitalization stocks _ plus good old stock-picking.

UN, RUSSIA COMPROMISE ON IRAQI OIL SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAURIA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Putting aside other differences, the United
States and Russia crafted a compromise Friday in the UN Security
Council to allow Iraq to sell a limited amount of oil to buy food
and medicine for the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington and Moscow remain far apart on the contentious
issues of suspending sanctions against Iraq and of returning UN
weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The council voted to permit Iraq to continue selling oil until
Dec. 4 under the 3-year-old food-for-oil program, which would have
ended Saturday without council action.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Iraq is allowed to sell $5.26 billion of oil
every six months. The proceeds go into a UN escrow account in
France from which the UN directs spending on humanitarian aid for
Iraqi civilians. Average Iraqis have been hurt by more than nine
years of UN sanctions imposed on Baghdad after its August 1990
invasion of Kuwait, the first act of the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Friday's temporary deal, Russia still is pushing hard
for a suspension of sanctions when weapons inspections resume.
Washington, however, wants broader Iraqi cooperation with
inspectors before suspending sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants to use the leverage of sanctions to
ensure that Baghdad is not again moving toward biological,
chemical, or nuclear weapons capability.
</P>
<P>
   The former Cold War adversaries clashed Thursday over Russia's
military campaign in Chechnya, with President Clinton bluntly
criticizing President Boris Yeltsin before heads of state at the
54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
summit in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   ``US-Russia relations are about as low as they have been since
the end of the Cold War,'' said Richard Shultz, director of the
international strategic studies program at Tufts University's
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Russia have disagreed over Iraq for more
than a year, but their differences over Chechnya have combined for
a volatile mix. Russia reportedly offered to cooperate on Iraq at
the Security Council if the United States agreed not to bring up
Chechnya in the council.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times said Friday that the State Department
rejected the offer out of hand. Sergei Lavrov, Russia's UN
ambassador, denied the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be no link between Iraq and Chechnya,'' he said.
``You should be used by now to all sorts of leakages from
Washington. I lost my count whether a leak is genuine or
fabricated.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Russia's dire economic circumstances, withholding
International Monetary Fund loans might be the biggest lever
Washington can pull to refocus Moscow's views on Chechnya and Iraq.
The United States is considering withholding the next loan package.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we tried to use that against Russia, it could backfire,''
Shultz said, adding that such a move could feed resurgent
nationalism in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   However, time may not be on America's side when it comes to
Iraq. As long as inspectors stay out of the country, Iraq could
more easily rearm. The Pentagon said Thursday that Baghdad might be
rebuilding its chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   US officials point fingers at Moscow for the delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gone the extra mile and who is holding this up?''
asked one US diplomat, who did not want to be identified. ``You
cannot suspend the sanctions as soon as the inspectors arrive. We
are not going to have sham inspections.''

INVESTING WITH STEVEN E. FOLKER: FIFTH THIRD QUALITY GROWTH FUND

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every summer, Steven E. Folker treks up to his cabin in the
northern Wisconsin woods near Chequamegon Bay to cast his line for
smallmouth bass and lake trout. The rest of the year, he seeks
bigger fish _ large-capitalization, high-quality growth companies
that will end up in the portfolio of the fund he manages, Fifth
Third Quality Growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want companies that historically have been able to
consistently grow their earnings at above-average rates,'' Folker
said from his office at the headquarters of Fifth Third Bancorp in
Cincinnati, overlooking the coal and oil barges that dot the Ohio
River. ``More important, we want companies with strong earnings
growth in the next three to five years.''
</P>
<P>
   He has reeled in some winners. The fund, with $774.8 million in
assets, returned 26.8 percent a year, on average, for the three
years through Nov. 12, compared with 21.1 percent for its peer
group of large blend funds and 26.1 percent for the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago
financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Folker, 44, looks for leading American companies in growth
industries _ generally companies with market capitalizations of
more than $10 billion, although he does hold a few midcap companies
with market caps of between $5 billion and $10 billion. His goal is
annual earnings growth of more than 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He also keeps a sharp eye on price. Typically, he aims to pay a
price-to-earnings multiple that is less than twice the company's
comparable growth rate: for example, a P/E of 35, or so, for a
company whose earnings are growing 25 percent a year. But he is
willing to pay a bit more for faster growers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a company's fundamentals and growth prospects are really
strong,'' he said, ``we'll be a little flexible on its valuation.''
</P>
<P>
   Folker said he and the seven analysts working on the fund spend
most of their energy on bottom-up, fundamental research. ``Mostly,
we tear companies apart fundamentally to see whether they have the
growth prospects that we're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   To choose the roughly 50 stocks in the fund, he looks for solid
balance sheets. And he likes to see plenty of cash being produced _
``enough to generate free cash flow,'' he said, ``or to generate
enough cash to fund the company's future growth without diluting
earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wants relatively modest amounts of debt, generally a
ratio of debt to total capitalization of no more than 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Folker likes a high return on equity, too, typically seeking 18
percent or more. ``We like to see high and stable profit margins,''
he added, ``ideally improving margins.''
</P>
<P>
   Folker and the analysts devote much time to visiting companies
and talking to management. ``We want to confirm the growth
prospects and understand the company's long-term strategy for
achieving above-average growth,'' he said. When management is
focused on increasing shareholder value, he is doubly pleased,
especially if the executives' compensation is linked to
performance.
</P>
<P>
   He steers clear of companies whose earnings growth is dependent
upon the vagaries of the world's economy. So he is unlikely to hold
steel, automobile or commodity chemical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Folker recently added to his position in Schering-Plough, the
pharmaceutical giant that produces Claritin, the allergy
medication, and Intron A, used for cancer and hepatitis patients.
The company has no debt and generates enough cash flow to finance
significant amounts of research and development, Folker added. Its
return on equity is 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, ``we think there will be ongoing consolidation in the
pharmaceutical industry,'' he said, ``and this company is a leading
acquisition target.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund originally bought Schering-Plough shares in 1996, at an
average cost of $25. Folker forecasts 16 percent annual earnings
growth for the company over the next three to five years. The stock
now trades at $55.4375, or 39.6 times his 1999 earnings forecast of
$1.40 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Folker also likes Marsh &AMP; McClellan, the insurance broker that
owns Putnam Investments, a money manager, and the Mercer Consulting
Group. He expects earnings at Putnam to grow 15 percent to 20
percent a year because of its ``strong reputation and heavy equity
orientation.'' Mercer should grow even faster, he said _ about 20
percent to 25 percent a year, ``because it's well positioned in
attractive growth markets, particularly the pension and retirement
area, health care and compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   Marsh &AMP; McClellan's ratio of debt to total capital is 39
percent, he added, very solid for its industry. Its return on
equity is 23 percent, and net profit margins _ more than 10 percent
over the past three to five years _ should expand as its
high-margin money management and consulting businesses grow.
</P>
<P>
   The fund started buying shares in April 1998 at an average cost
of $59. On Friday, the stock closed at $79, or 22.6 times his 1999
earnings estimate of $3.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   He added to his position in another favorite, Texas Instruments,
in September. ``The company is the world leader in digital signal
processors, which is the core product in the telecommunications
industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Instruments' shift away from commodity products like
dynamic random access memory chips, or DRAMs, to proprietary,
value-added products, like DSPs, will ratchet up its growth to
about 25 percent a year from just 3 percent over the past five
years, Folker said. Its ratio of debt to total capital is just 12
percent, he said, and its return on equity is 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He first bought shares in November 1998, at $32. The stock
closed on Friday at $98.375, or 57.9 times his 1999 earnings
estimate of $1.70 a share.

US TAX DOLLARS _ VIA IMF AID TO RUSSIA _ FUNDING WAR? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As US officials condemn Russia's military campaign in
Chechnya, are American taxpayers about to unwittingly help bankroll
it? Russia is waging war to destroy Islamic militants in its
restive Caucasus region. Like all wars, this one costs money _ as
much as $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   So where does a cash-strapped, debt-ridden country like Russia,
which has trouble paying its teachers and doctors, get the money?
While rising oil prices have put billions of additional dollars in
Russia's coffers, Moscow is still largely dependent on foreign
lenders. Russia is currently awaiting a total of over $1.1 billion
in credits, $640 million from the International Monetary Fund and
$495 million from the US Export-Import Bank.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton chastised Yeltsin this week for ``an endless
cycle of violence'' against innocent civilians in Chechnya. But US
National Security Advisor Sandy Berger said that ``it would not
make sense'' for the United States to deny Russia financial
assistance over the conflict. ``That goes to the very stability of
Russia,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   This raises the uncomfortable question: Is it possible for the
United States to support Russia's economy with aid and loans
without being complicit in a military campaign the White House
opposes?
</P>
<P>
   The $640 million from the IMF is part of a $4.5 billion loan
package approved in July. The Kremlin and the IMF both say the
funds will be used exclusively to pay off Moscow's old debts.
Economists, however, insist that the loan will indirectly help
Moscow pay for the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, the IMF is helping to finance the war in
Chechnya,'' said Ben Slay, senior economist at PlanEcon, a
Washington consulting firm that specializes in Russia and Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is required to pay a total of $1.62 billion in foreign
debts by the end of this year, including $1 billion to the IMF. The
$640 million IMF loan that is pending will never actually reach
Russia. It will go right back to the IMF to cover part of Russia's
debt to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   IMF spokesman Thomas Dawson denied that the loan _ which will be
deposited to a Russian Central Bank account in New York and then be
used to pay off some of Russia's past debt _ could in any way be
used to support Russia's military.
</P>
<P>
   But Slay and other economists argue that the IMF loan will free
up money in Russia's coffers, that would have otherwise gone to pay
off international debts, for other aims _ like waging war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian government is increasing its expenditures to pay
for the war. They are also short of funds which is why they are
borrowing money in the first place,'' Marshall Goldman, associate
director of Harvard University's Davis Center for Russian Studies,
said. ``They need to free up funding for the war and the IMF money
could basically be used for this purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government, according to the Finance Ministry, has
increased defense spending for this year by about $1 billion,
making the 1999 military budget $5.1 billion. The 2000 budget,
which originally forecast $3.7 billion, now _ taking into account
the Chechen war _ earmarks $4.6 billion for defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``National defense is priority number one in the budget,'' said
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, explaining the increase last month.
``We have to react and establish order (in Chechnya) and we need
more resources. But this will come from extra income.'' Putin did
not say where the ``extra income'' would come from.
</P>
<P>
   One place could be from increased oil revenues. World oil prices
skyrocketed this week past $25 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Russian oil companies are awaiting final
approval of two US government-guaranteed loans from the
Export-Import Bank: a $203 million credit to the Ryazan Oil
Refinery near Moscow and a $292 million loan to the Samotlar oil
field.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians here view continued international loans as an
implicit endorsement of government policy. In this spirit, Kremlin
spokesman Dmitri Yakushkin added that for the IMF and other lending
agencies to deny Russia credits now would mean that the West is
supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West is not so stupid as openly to support murderers,''
Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
   But back in 1996, when Russia was still fighting its first war
in Chechnya _ which killed some 80,000 people _ IMF director Michel
Camdessus acknowledged that its loans were indirectly helping the
military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who tell me, `You are funding Chechnya' _ in some ways,
yes, because we are funding Russia,'' Camdessus said in February
1996, adding that Moscow's moral judgments were not the
responsibility of the organization. ``But if the IMF does not lend
its support, do you think this will shorten the war by just one
day? No.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the IMF loaned Russia $6 billion and approved another
$10.2 billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush Jr. and Arizona Senator John
McCain _ both candidates for the Republican presidential nomination
_ have called for a cutoff of US aid and loans to Russia while the
war in Chechnya continues.

   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ The signs in this rural college town
read ``Aggieland,'' but for the faithful of Texas A&AMP;M University,
the expression is less a point on a map than a state of mind. Ask
someone to explain the fierce devotion of alumni, or the school's
arcane traditions, and the answer is often a smile or a shake of
the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the outside looking in, you can't understand it,'' said
Ian Hastings, 27, a 1995 graduate, repeating a familiar phrase.
``From the inside looking out, you can't explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase is particularly apt after a campus accident on
Thursday, in which 11 students were killed while building a huge
wooden structure for a traditional Thanksgiving Day football
bonfire. To outsiders looking in, the image of scores of students
clambering atop a 40-foot tower of logs in the early morning hours
with limited university oversight might seem unduly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   But to Aggies, as students and alumni are known, the bonfire is
a 90-year tradition that binds generations of students to one
another and to the university. Students aspire to become Red Pots
or Brown Pots, the upperclassmen who oversee the round-the-clock
construction effort. The state's lieutenant governor, Rick Perry,
and the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Henry
Cisneros, both hoisted logs in their undergraduate days. Recent
graduates often return to help out during the final week, known as
Push.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been said several times that once you're a part of A&AMP;M,
you have maroon blood,'' John Hoyle, a professor of educational
administration who has written about the university's lore, said of
the school's colors. ``You're a member of the long maroon line.''
</P>
<P>
   With the last body removed from the wreckage early Friday
morning, university officials pledged a full investigation into the
accident. A federal investigator with the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration arrived Friday. And even though the cause of
the accident had not yet been determined, the university police
announced that they would not conduct a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be an engineering determination,'' said Bob Wiatt,
public safety director for the university. ``There is no negligence
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood across campus Friday was somber as students wore white
and maroon ribbons or carried carnations and roses. Seven of the 28
students injured in the accident remained hospitalized, including
four in intensive care. The hundreds of onlookers who stood vigil
for hours during the long rescue effort on Thursday had mostly
dispersed Friday, though some tearful students prayed or simply
stared at the cleared stacks of logs.
</P>
<P>
   University officials canceled this year's bonfire, which marks
the school's biggest football game against its rival, the
University of Texas. The football game is still scheduled for next
Friday at Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   The internal investigation is expected to examine the future of
the bonfire and whether changes are necessary. Cindy Lawson, a
university spokeswoman, said officials would first focus on
consoling and healing the ``Aggie family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do is get to the bottom of what happened, and
make some decision based on that,'' Ms. Lawson said. ``To say if
we're going to change bonfire is probably premature at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Within Texas, where school rivalries are fierce, Texas A&AMP;M is
known for its almost religious adherence to traditions, some of
which are nearly a century old. For some, the gold class ring
awarded to seniors is worn for life, and Hoyle said the
indoctrination begins for with Fish Camp, where literally thousands
of incoming freshman attend a summer camp ``to learn the rituals,
the yells, to develop the friendships for life.''
</P>
<P>
   The most enthusiastic guardians of the rituals are the school's
2,000 member Corps of Cadets, a quasimilitary cadre who shave their
heads and wear uniforms to class. The most revered tradition is
Silver Taps, or Muster, the service held on the first Tuesday of
every month if a student has died during the month. Every year on
April 21, the anniversary of the battle of San Jacinto, the battle
in which Texas defeated Mexico to become a republic, alumni across
the world hold Muster to remember fallen Aggies. Last year,
officials said, alumni in 112 countries conducted the ritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent two years in Afghanistan running a medical school,''
recalled Dr. James H. ``Red'' Duke, a prominent alumnus who is
medical director of LifeFlight, the second oldest helicopter
medical program in the country. ``I had hepatitis in March of '71.
The first time I left the house I drove 90 miles to Aggie Muster in
Kabul on April 21st. There were nine Texas Aggies and nine Afghan
Aggies.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this same passion that permeates the tradition of Bonfire,
which first occurred in 1909 and until 1936 was fueled with stolen
desks, chairs and other items. Hastings, the 1995 graduate, said
his telephone rang in Dallas on Thursday morning within an hour of
the 2:28 a.m. accident and that he had arrived within five hours to
help with the rescue effort. ``My roommate said I had 47 messages
by nine in the morning,'' said Hastings, who served as a Brown Pot
while an undergraduate. ``My cell phone rang 100 times on the way
here. It's a big family.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Link, a fifth-year senior, said about 21 upperclassmen
serve as coordinators each year for harvesting trees and then
construction, 16 of whom are called Red Pots, the highest ranking,
and another five are Brown Pots. The nicknames are for the colors
of hats worn by coordinators during the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The colors are visual aids,'' said Link, a former Red Pot who
wore a T-shirt from the 1997 bonfire that read, ``Remember the
Tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got a lot of people working in a crowd, you need
to be able to stand out.''
</P>
<P>
   Link said that upperclassmen select new coordinators each year
and hand down instructions on how to build the 55-foot tiered
structure. There have been assorted minor injuries through the
years, and the structure collapsed in 1994 after heavy rains, but
no one was hurt. Link said the coordinators hold training courses
for the harvest and the construction process, and that different
work crews are scheduled 24 hours a day during Push week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a class that will teach them more than anything they
can learn on campus as far as people skills and work ethic,'' Link
said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But university officials, who sanction the event, say they have
exerted more oversight in recent years. A university liaison to the
project, Rusty Thompson, advises the students and officials said he
provides daily oversight. But though Thompson visited the tower
hours before the accident, detecting no problems, he was not
present when the accident occurred. Wiatt said a university police
officer was at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every student must go through a safety training program before
participating in bonfire,'' said Lane Stephenson, deputy director
of university relations. ``Safety has always been of paramount
importance, even though it is recognized that there are some
inherent risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, officials began a crackdown on alcohol use during
the project after occasional reports of drunkenness. Shannon Ensom,
21, a senior from Coppell, Tex., who served on an bonfire advisory
committee this year, said hundreds of students signed cards
pledging not to drink. The theme was, ``Don't Let Alcohol Shatter
the Tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to show everybody that that wasn't what bonfire is
about,'' she said. Stephenson said officials had heard no reports
of alcohol being involved in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether the university will exert even
greater control over the bonfire, or even cancel it, as the
University of Texas did years ago with a similar event. In a
response to a query delivered by e-mail, Cisneros spoke of the
``great esprit de corps'' and lessons of teamwork provided by the
bonfire. But the accident, he said, also made him realize the
inherent danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very graphic for me because I worked on that bonfire and
it's a huge project and just the weight of those logs and the scale
of it drives home how utterly dangerous it is when something goes
wrong,'' he said in a response left on an answering machine. ``I
guess it was always dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke, whose first bonfire came during his freshman year in 1946,
said the faithful of Aggieland ``can't redo this event but we can
learn from it. We always learn more when things are tough than when
they're going well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd give anything in the world for it not to have happened,''
he added. ``I think we have to go and figure out what's wrong,
correct it and proceed.''

FUTURE OF A&AMP;M BONFIRE AWAITS END OF INVESTIGATION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Texas A&AMP;M will not make any decision on
whether to extinguish its 90-year-old annual bonfire ritual until
investigators determine why its tiered framework of logs collapsed
early Thursday, killing 11 current and former students, University
President Ray Bowen said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone wants to see the bonfire continue, but until
we have concluded our investigation and know the causes of this
tragedy, I think it will be left on the table the possibility that
it will not continue,'' Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost universally, students, campus leaders and alumni said
they want the tradition revived next year, although they
acknowledge that additional safety measurements must be taken to
prevent a recurrence of Thursday's accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dadgum it, we're the best engineers in the world. We ought to
be able to build whatever we want to build and do it safely,'' said
Scott Brady, a third generation Aggie and president of a Dallas
engineering firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We absolutely have to do a post-mortem on how it was run, the
way it was built and who supervised it so when it goes on, no one
gets hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Short of Colleyville, Texas, said the consensus among her
four brothers and sisters, all of whom attended A&AMP;M and married
Aggies, is that the bonfire should continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart, I think there's just so much benefit to it, I
hate to see it go,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many older alumni see the bonfire, and its related yell
practices and rituals, as a link to A&AMP;M's ``Old Army'' days as an
all-male military school. More recent graduates say it's a way for
Aggies, male and female, to bond with each other.
</P>
<P>
   University officials said they are aware that the overwhelming
majority of students and alumni favor keeping the bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now everyone is dealing with emotion, and all Aggies
emotionally want the bonfire to survive,'' said Bowen, who canceled
next week's bonfire lighting in wake of the deaths. ``But we need
to set aside our emotions and objectively investigate the causes of
this accident. That's why it's going to take some time for us to
reach a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Thompson, the university's bonfire advisor, met with
leaders of the project Thursday night and said most want the
tradition resumed next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all want to see it go forward, but they also want to know
what happened,'' Thompson said. ``They want answers just like
everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who has been involved since he was a student, also
hopes the bonfire returns next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I would like to see it, but I know we can't say
that for sure at this time,'' Thompson said. ``It's a big part of
my life, just like it is to a lot of Aggies, and I would hate to
see it go. But we can't say it's definitely coming back until we
know what happened and determine if there is way for it to be built
safely.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been some talk that the bonfire could move off-campus
if officials determine it is unsafe or are worried about liability
risks.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen believes Aggies will follow the university's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas A&AMP;M's culture is a little different,'' Bowen said.
``It's like a big family. Now that family may sometimes bicker or
quarrel or have disagreements, but they stick together and I think
the family will stick together on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson acknowledged that some of the more passionate of the
university's supporters might feel differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing Aggies, there might be some that would want to do
that,'' Thompson said. ``But I don't know logistically how they
would do that without the university umbrella. From getting the
timber, to obtaining permits _ I don't know what you might have to
get _ to finding a large enough piece of land to have it, the
obstacles would probably be enormous. But that doesn't mean some
Aggies wouldn't try it.''
</P>
<P>
   Student body president Will Hurd said that although students
remain in shock over the tragedy, a consensus has already formed to
keep the bonfire going.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like one of the parents of the victims said yesterday:
`What better way to honor my son than to have the bonfire each
year?' '' Hurd said. ``That is the way most students feel at this
campus. They want to find a way to make it safer, but they don't
want to see it disappear. It's part of the life blood of Texas
A&AMP;M.''

ATHENS ERUPTS IN RIOTING AS CLINTON BEGINS VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN AND TOULA VLAHOU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ Thousands of anti-American rioters took to the streets
here Friday, setting fires, throwing rocks and clashing with tear
gas-wielding police as President Clinton arrived and proclaimed
himself ``a `phili mou,' a friend of Greece.''
</P>
<P>
   The president brushed off the hostile welcome as a hearty
display of free speech by citizens of the world's oldest democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some engage in passionate debate, it is well to remember
how hard both of our countries have fought to do just that,''
Clinton told guests at a state dinner in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton's plane touched down in Athens, an estimated 10,000
protesters gathered on Athens' central Syndagma Square before going
on a fiery, destructive rampage that left dozens of shops and banks
in flames. The American Express office was among those damaged.
</P>
<P>
   When some of the more militant protesters tried to push through
police lines toward the US embassy, they were met with cannisters
of tear gas. The skies filled with black, acrid smoke as masked,
hooded protesters set piles of garbage aflame.
</P>
<P>
   Shattered glass lay on the streets, and the remnants of
eye-irritating tear gas hung in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an ugly night,'' said a clerk in front of a downtown
hotel, where several fires were set.
</P>
<P>
   Athens, usually bustling with shoppers, late-evening diners and
strolling couples, was eerily empty Friday night, as police closed
down entire sections of town for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Greek officials reported that 15 people were injured and 40
detained in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, mainly communists and self-proclaimed
anarchists, feel a deep, lingering anger over what they see as
tacit US approval for the military junta that ruled Greece from
1967-1974, and for the failure of the United States to act when
Turkey invaded the largely Greek-populated island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   While Greece is a NATO member and US ally, the Greek people were
also overwhelmingly against the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia,
Greece's fellow Christian Orthodox, Balkan neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Americanism has been ``rejuvenated by Kosovo,'' said former
Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, one of the guests at the
state dinner. The one surprise, Samaras said, was that the small
but relatively disciplined communists, who were expected to take
the lead in the demonstrations, were upstaged by their rivals, the
anarchists.
</P>
<P>
   Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou called the events ``a
peaceful demonstration,'' saying that only thousands had shown up
and ``maybe one hundred caused a ruckus.''
</P>
<P>
   Police were instructed to quell the demonstrations without
forcing a violent confrontation, said a Greek official who asked
not to be named. ``The last thing we need are any incidents between
the police and these people,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators were a small minority of ``yobs, louts and
hooligans'' who want to ``manipulate the news,'' said Alex Rondos,
an advisor to the Greek Foreign Minister.
</P>
<P>
   Greece and the United States share strong ties, with several
million Greeks now living in America, he noted. But ``there are
still a a few people who hold some hard, extremist views,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who earlier in the day said he was not worried about
predicted protests, arrived at the airport before a small group of
supporters whose feeble cries of ``Clinton! Clinton!'' only
emphasized the strength of their opponents in the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come here as a `phili mou,' a friend of Greece,''
Clinton told the group of about 200 people, who waved small
American and Greek flags as they greeted him. ``And I look forward
to experiencing that wonderful quality of Greek hospitality known
to all the world as phyloxenia.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton dived into the crowd to shake hands with pre-selected
group of supporters. ``We're from the embassy,'' said one man.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek government had made the customary effort to make the
Clintons feel welcome. A red carpet led from Air Force One to the
president's limousine, and Chelsea Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton
and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright were all presented with
bouquets of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also clear Greek officials feared danger. The
Ellinikon Airport in Athens _ long criticized by the United States
and others as having lax security _ was packed with police. The
motorcade kept close alongside Clinton as he worked the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The streets from the airport to Clinton's hotel were closed to
traffic and lined on both sides by police. In a city of 4 million
people, there was just a smattering of Greek civilians observing
Clinton's motorcade to downtown. Most simply stared and did not
cheer or wave.
</P>
<P>
   No protesters were visible along Clinton's motorcade route.
</P>
<P>
   The reception was a stark contrast to the effusive welcome the
Clintons received earlier in Turkey, with whom Greece has a
mutually suspicious, sometimes hostile, relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the afternoon, Clinton toured the ornate,
16th-century Topkapi Palace in Istanbul and took a cruise on the
Bosporus, the strait that connects the Black Sea to the
Mediterranean. As the Clintons passed in their limousine, hundreds
of Turks stood along the sidewalk, waving and smiling
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton took the Greeks public's angry welcome in stride,
lauding such famous Greek-Americans as former Massachusetts
officials as Gov. Michael Dukakis and Senator Paul Tsongas. ``In
addition to friendship and partnership, Greece has given America
another precious gift _ some of her best people,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the two nations' differences over Kosovo, Greece and the
United States have long been allies in military and democratic
struggles, Clinton added, noting that Greece is among only seven
countries worldwide which has sided with the United States in every
major international conflict this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in all friendships, we have not always agreed,'' the
president said, ``but we have never broken ranks, because of our
shared devotion to democracy and freedom.''

   Space tourism will materialize faster than most people think,
with short flights as soon as 2004 and extended visits possible
within 20 years, British travel agents were told last week at a
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolff, marketing director for an American architectural
firm, Wimberly Allison Tong &AMP; Goo, told an audience at the World
Travel Forum in London that his firm is working on designs for a
100-bed orbital hotel that he hopes will be open for business by
2017, featuring artificial gravity to protect queasy guests from
``space sickness.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, and for the first time since Pan American World
Airways stopped adding names to a half-serious space flight waiting
list 30 years ago, it is now possible to book a trip beyond the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now two companies are offering suborbital space flights
in the neighborhood of $100,000 a trip to experience a few minutes
of weightlessness,'' Wolff said, adding that he expected prices to
fall once flights became routine.

 &HT;    Bush reveals moderate foreign policy goals
 &HT;    By Ken Herman and Jena Heath
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush,
eager to prove he's not a governor in over his head, Friday offered
a moderate foreign policy in which America is not the world's cop
but is not afraid to wield its clout, either.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Bush
called for ``a distinctly American internationalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Idealism, without illusions,'' he said. ``Confidence, without
conceit. Realism, in the service of American ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us have an American foreign policy that reflects American
character. The modesty of true strength, the humility of real
greatness,'' Bush said in a foreign policy speech built on months
of meetings with experts brought in to get him up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   Staking out such a middle ground is consistent with Bush's
overall campaign of compassionate conservatism and moderate
positions on other issues. Buttressed by high poll numbers and
record-breaking fund raising, Bush is able to steer a more moderate
foreign policy course than other GOP candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his Republican rivals criticized the speech. Publisher
Steve Forbes said it lacked specifics and could have been given by
a Democrat. Arizona Sen. John McCain's campaign said the speech
could have been given by their candidate. McCain hit many of the
same themes _ and specifics _ in a speech last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech came after his inability to pass a pop quiz on
world leaders and his botching of proper names for citizens of some
countries. Outside the Reagan Library, California Democrats donned
dunce caps to make their point about Bush's lack of international
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Democratic National Committee said Friday
that Bush's gaffes ``indicated a fundamental lack of knowledge
about the complexities of the post-Cold War world.''
</P>
<P>
   The DNC also reminded Americans of a warning issued by
then-President George Bush in his campaign against a governor who
eventually ousted him: ``I ask you to close your eyes and imagine
in a crisis situation an American leader totally without
experience, completely untested, a leader about whom we know very,
very little, if you get down to it.''
</P>
<P>
   But inside the Reagan Library, Bush was introduced in glowing
terms by former Secretary of State George Schultz, a member of his
advisory team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an education for me in seeing the instincts of this
man,'' Schultz said, ``the way in which he grasps things and the
convictions that go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, declined to take questions Friday, skipping an
opportunity to display his knowledge of foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have done throughout the campaign on days of major
speeches, he lets the speech speak for itself,'' said spokeswoman
Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Bush keyed on Russia and China, adding a nod to India's
growing importance.
</P>
<P>
   Former Ambassador Richard Armitage, a Bush foreign policy
adviser, said Friday's goal was to lay out Bush's ``priorities for
our involvement in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the North Koreans and the Iraqis are troublesome and
nettlesome ... they're not matters of national survival for the
United States,'' Armitage said. ``If we get the big power
relationships correct, then, as he suggests, we'll have generations
of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's world view includes China as a ``a competitor, not a
strategic partner,'' and Russia as a nation worthy of assistance
but in need of an occasional forceful nudge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as we support Russian reform, we cannot excuse Russian
brutality. When the Russian government attacks civilians, killing
women and children, leaving orphans and refugees, it can no longer
expect aid from international lending institutions,'' he said,
referring to Russian intervention in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   On China, Bush called for relations ``without ill-will, but
without illusions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am president, China will find itself respected as a great
power, but in a region of strong democratic alliances,'' he said.
``It will be unthreatened, but not unchecked.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had harsh words for President Clinton, noting that China
has been referred to by the administration as both ``the butchers
of Beijing'' and, more recently, a ``strategic partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Bush talked of a balance that ``takes time to achieve''
and flourishes in free trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's first temptation is withdrawal, to build a proud
tower of protectionism and isolation,'' he said. ``In a world that
depends on America to reconcile old rivals and balance ancient
ambitions, this is the shortcut to chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also criticized the other extreme, the temptation to
patrol the planet like a cop on the beat, moving ``from crisis to
crisis like a cork in a current.''
</P>
<P>
   ``America must be involved in the world,'' he said. ``But that
does not mean our military is the answer to every difficult foreign
policy situation, a substitute for strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush offered no yardstick for determining what conflicts are
worthy of militarily involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Condoleezza Rice, head of his foreign policy team, said the key
is acting before guns are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a question of whether you respond to a situation
like Bosnia or Rwanda,'' she said. ``It's a question of whether you
respond with military force. If you recognize that the military is
actually a very special instrument that doesn't do well in murky
political circumstances, you might avail yourself earlier on of
other diplomatic tools.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also reiterated his opposition to the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty recently rejected by Congress. The treaty, he said,
offers false hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation must diminish the evil attraction of these weapons
for rogue states by rendering them useless with missile defense,''
he said, dismissing the treaty as nonverifiable and unenforceable.
``On these crucial matters it offers only words and false hopes and
high intentions _ with no guarantees whatsoever. We can fight the
spread of nuclear weapons, but we cannot wish them away with unwise
treaties.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush drew his most prolonged applause Friday when he said he
would never place U.S. troops under United Nations command and
would allow the nation to pay its U.N. dues ``only if the U.N.'s
bureaucracy is reformed and our disproportionate share of its costs
is reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky said Bush's ideas sounded much
like McCain's and that differences would become clearer when GOP
candidates debate in New Hampshire on Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased that it tracked pretty closely to what Senator
McCain's been saying for a long time now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a former POW in Vietnam, outlined much the same
philosophy in a foreign policy speech at Kansas State University in
March, calling for a nonisolationist approach to world affairs, a
more cautious stance toward China and careful delineation of when
and how to involve U.S. soldiers in other countries' conflicts. He
also called on the International Monetary Fund to hold off on
further loans to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes criticized Bush's speech, saying ``it was very general,
very short on specifics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is in favor of peace and prosperity. With a few
changes of phrase, it could almost have been given by Bill Clinton
or Al Gore or Bill Bradley,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   He characterized Bush's call for a cooperative but tougher
stance with China as unoriginal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the cautionary note was one I think most people would
buy into now,'' he said.

SENATE APPROVES SPENDING MEASURE, 74-24 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate turned out the lights Friday night on a
tumultuous session of Congress that lurched from the crucible of
impeachment to a bruising budget fight but barely changed the face
of government.
</P>
<P>
   Boxed in by budget caps and a delicate balance of power,
President Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress struggled
to a near standoff that ended with both sides claiming victory over
a $390 billion spending package that all but ensured the status
quo.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the measure, 74-24, and sent it to Clinton to
sign into law.
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, the Senate gave final approval, 95-1, to one of
the most significant changes in social policy this year: an $800
million program to provide health coverage and other services over
five years to help the disabled find work and keep it.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the disabilities measure, members of both parties
agreed, the only major legislation that survived the first session
of the 106th Congress was a sweeping overhaul of the financial
services industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``With rare exceptions, this has been a Congress of lost
causes,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a prime sponsor of the
disabilities bill with Senator James M. Jeffords, a Vermont
Republican. ``This bill survived but too many others died.''
</P>
<P>
   Left unresolved on Capitol Hill were major issues that are
likely to emerge as central themes in the election battle next year
for control of Congress and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were foiled in their bid for massive tax cuts by
Clinton's veto of their $792 billion package of reductions. And
Democrats were stymied on nearly every major element of their
agenda: overhauling the managed care industry, expanding hate crime
laws, tightening gun controls, increasing the minimum wage, and
changing the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the stalemate, the White House and leaders of both parties
in Congress scurried to take credit for paying down the federal
debt and protecting the Social Security surplus even as they
acknowledged using a number of unusual accounting techniques to
exceed the balanced-budget caps they set in 1997. More than $6
billion was added to the spending package in the final hours of
negotiations to secure the votes needed to pass the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, one of several conservative
Republicans to vote against the measure, said Congress used ``fancy
footwork and budget gimmicks'' to help provide ``a victory for the
liberal social agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   But, most of all, party leaders sought praise for fostering some
minor changes and killing others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think this has been a very good year for the American
people,'' said Senate majority leader Trent Lott. ``This
administration, the Democrats, if they had their way they would
have spent more, raised taxes and increased regulations across the
board. We stopped all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopping things was a priority of both sides, Senator John F.
Kerry said, citing the GOP tax cut that Clinton's veto message
described as a ``reckless'' threat to the government's fiscal
stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we should not be reduced to measuring victories by
stopping them from doing something bad,'' Kerry said. ``This has
been a session of missed opportunities and a lack of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans avoided a repeat of the 1995 government shutdown
that backfired against them. They did so by compromising on demands
to cut $41 billion in non-defense spending and by continuing to
fund several of Clinton's signature priorities, such as hiring
100,000 new teachers and 50,000 new police officers.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House also gave ground, agreeing to increase
defense spending by $17 billion and to cut every federal agency's
budget by 0.038 percent, for a total savings of about $1.3 billion.
Clinton had vetoed a 0.97 percent across-the-board cut as
``mindless.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the final agreement, each agency has flexibility in how to
reduce spending rather than requiring cuts across the board. The
Pentagon, for example, is exempt from reducing military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there will be some discomfort,'' said Jack Lew,
Clinton's budget director. ``There will be winners and losers, but
we won't be cutting high priority items.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most controversial compromises of the budget
talks, GOP leaders agreed to pay $927 million of the government's
long-overdue United Nations obligations after the White House
accepted some abortion restrictions on international family
planning groups funded by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the final spending package was nearly blocked by a
group of Midwestern senators who were irate that the bill includes
a provision to extend the New England Dairy Compact another two
years. The compact sets federal dairy prices that favor milk
producers from the Northeast over those from the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   After Lott vowed to address the issue next year, the Midwestern
senators dropped their plan to filibuster as late as 5 a.m.
Saturday. Senator Russell D. Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, had
even prepared a document, ``All About Cheese: Dairy Filibuster.''
</P>
<P>
   Relieved, Lott said, ``The Senate teaches you patience. If
there's anything in the world like a good wine, it's the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the final vote was tallied, the $1.8 trillion
federal budget for 2000 was complete, 50 days past the Oct. 1 start
of the fiscal year. And the acrimony of the impeachment case had
receded a bit, though tensions lingered.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords urged his colleagues to take consolation from their
passage of the disabilities measure. ``We are tired and some
tempers are frayed,'' he said on the Senate floor. ``But as we
return to our districts, this is legislation we can be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who helped lead the effort in January to remove Clinton
from office, said in a news conference Friday, ``Democrats still
are chafing over the fact that they are in the minority.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his final words on the Senate floor, Lott turned toward
the Democratic side of the chamber and wished departing members a
``Happy Thanksgiving and Merry Christmas.''

FOREIGN AIRLINES INCREASINGLY IN DEMAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Air disasters like the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990
make Americans a bit nervous about foreign airlines _ particularly
the carriers of Third World countries _ but they still clamber
aboard. More and more Americans are using non-American airlines to
reach exotic corners of the world for business and pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Once they get there, they may be putting their lives on the line
by using the domestic airlines in some Third World countries,
especially in the poorest African nations and former Soviet
republics, where maintenance can be sporadic, spare parts
unaffordable, and pilots perhaps too reliant on the proverbial wing
and a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say flying a foreign airline from Boston's Logan
International or any other US airport is no more dangerous than
boarding a US-flagged craft, since foreign airlines flying in and
out of the United States have to meet the same safety standards as
US passenger aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, airline and tourist industry analysts say, crashes
like that of EgyptAir don't seem to have a ``ripple effect'' of
scaring Americans away from the airlines of underdeveloped
countries any more than the crash of a SwissAir plane frightens
them from European airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Americans overwhelming prefer to fly American-based
airlines, but that's mostly a matter of brand-name consciousness or
convenience,'' said David Stempler of the Washington-based Air
Travelers Association. ``They tend to be most nervous about
non-brand-name carriers, whether foreign or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Small but steadily increasing numbers of American travelers
appear to be picking foreign airlines, often because these carriers
make the most direct flights to out-of-the-way destinations. Last
year, 58.5 million travelers flew foreign carriers in or out of the
United States, according to the US Department of Transportation.
That compares with 31.3 million using foreign carriers five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to go to the Philippines, you can board a familiar
American carrier and route through Japan,'' Stempler said. ``Or you
can fly Philippine Airlines nonstop to Manila.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 foreign-based airlines are licensed to carry
passengers in and out of the United States. They range from such
renowned carriers as Dutch KLM and Singapore Airlines to Ghana
Airways and Air Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are the world's top globe-trotters, expected to make
60 million business and vacation trips to foreign countries this
year _ an increase of 13.5 million in just five years.
</P>
<P>
   For service and amenities, front-rank carriers of Europe and
Asia are at least as good and often nicer than those of US-based
airlines. For safety, all airlines touching down in the United
States are equal, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason why Americans should be afraid of small
foreign carriers,'' said Robert Booth of Aviation Managament
Services, a Miami-based aviation consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Big airline disasters invariably create anxiety about flying and
tend to scare away passengers from the airline that crashed _ but
usually only for a month or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a negative impact for four or five weeks, but it
relates to the specific airline,'' said Booth. ``There is simply no
evidence of potential passengers steering away from airlines from
less-developed nations'' after a ``spectacular and awful tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may be wary of EgyptAir for a while,'' he said. ``But
that doesn't mean they are going to avoid Argentina's LAPA or some
other smaller Latin American airline.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts note that two of the three worst air disasters along the
Eastern Seaboard in recent years involved major Western airlines _
the 1996 plunge of TWA Flight 800 off Long Island and last year's
SwissAir Flight 111 tragedy off Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, after an air disaster, there is a heightened
awareness among travelers about air safety,'' said James Ashurst,
spokesman for the American Society of Travel Agents. ``But it
doesn't translate into a raised fear of smaller foreign carriers.
People aren't going to cancel that adventure trip to Vietnam just
because a plane from Egypt met with calamity.''
</P>
<P>
   By and large, foreign carriers flying into the United States
cater primarily to their own nationals or naturalized Americans
from a given country. A majority of EgyptAir's passengers to and
from the United States, for example, are either Egyptians or
Egyptian-Americans, much as Germans prefer Lufthansa or Finns like
Finnair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, Americans will choose a foreign carrier more often
than foreigners will pick an American carrier,'' Stempler said.

 &HT;    Amazon, Sotheby's link to offer upscale items
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Have you ever considered bidding on an original Marc
Chagall lithograph, but felt intimidated by a live auction?
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps Austin Powers' psychedelic Volkswagen Beetle was the
very thing you wanted for Christmas, but you didn't know where to
find it?
</P>
<P>
   Now these things are available for purchase in the comfort of
your own home.
</P>
<P>
   The venerable 255-year-old auction house Sotheby's has formed a
clever partnership with Amazon.com. Now you can buy fine china or
diamond brooches from Tiffany &AMP;Co. with the click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, considered by many to be the most successful online
retailer, sells music, books, electronics and a variety of other
items including toothpaste and electric drills, many at a discount
from offline retailers. Sotheby's dwells in a different world,
dealing in expensive and rare items such as art deco furniture,
Mongolian rugs, antique baseball cards and vintage American quilts.
</P>
<P>
   But Sotheby's doesn't deal in bargains. The auctions will carry
price tags ranging from $100 to $100,000 and up.
</P>
<P>
   The Sotheby's site on Amazon.com is quite different from
``person to person'' auctions like eBay and Amazon's other auction
site, where you place your bid and you take your chances buying
something from another individual out there in cyberspace.
Sotheby's is very much a professionally run business. Every lot, or
item up for bid, on the Sotheby's site is guaranteed for
authenticity and condition by either Sotheby's experts or one of
the 4,500 dealers it has preselected.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Pickett, general manager of sothebys.amazon.com, says
the new area is very different from the type of retailing Amazon
has tackled in the past. ``It's a whole new way to buy fine objects
online,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sotheby's and Amazon need each other,'' Pickett says. ``What
Sotheby's brings to the table is 255 years of sourcing and
authenticating fine objects. While Sotheby's auctions have always
featured some of the finest objects in the world, the company is
hoping that its presence on Amazon.com, one of the Web's most
trafficked sites, will bring more visibility and bidders. Sotheby's
acknowledges that many potential bidders are intimidated at the
thought of bidding at a live auction, but aren't shy at all about
online shopping or online auctions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Amazon deal also gives Sotheby's the online electronic
expertise and technology to help facilitate the bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon understands that any bidder about to type a number
followed by a bunch of zeros on the Sotheby's site needs to be sure
the site is secure, the goods for real and delivery prompt.
</P>
<P>
   Pickett also thinks the high-end credibility of Sotheby's
offerings will drive traffic to the company's ``person to person''
auction area. ``You may come to Sotheby's to buy china or a Persian
rug, but then go to the other auction area to buy a Beanie Baby for
your child. We think they are complimentary, but quite different.''
</P>
<P>
   Big ticket bidders on the sothebys.amazon.com site will have a
special one-click payment screen that will explain the cost of the
item plus shipping, insurance, taxes and other charges, such as
buyer's premium. The Sotheby's area will give users the opportunity
to pay by wire transfer, a special function for Sotheby's customers
not available anywhere else on the site. Pickett also says that the
sellers will never see the winning bidder's credit card number, for
added security.

COMMENTARY: WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?

 (bl)  
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When historians look back at America as it rang in the momentous
year of 2000, what will they find? Y2K panic? An outbreak of
millennial spirituality? ``Prosperity with a purpose''?
</P>
<P>
   Guess again. What they are going to see instead is a country
drunk on a TV quiz show called ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
As the countdown to the new millennium intensifies, it is
impossible to exaggerate the appeal of ABC's nightly national
Vesuvius of greenbacks. Even in the few days since its success
landed it on the front page of The New York Times, the show's
numbers have continued to soar. ``The Virgin Mary, Arnold
Schwarzenegger, leprechauns _ nothing could stop ((Regis)) Philbin
and his mind-numbing multiple choice show,'' wrote Lisa de Moraes
in The Washington Post, chronicling the depleted ratings for such
other network sweeps stunts as the heavily promoted spectacular
``Mary, Mother of Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the ``Millionaire'' viewership huge, but in an era
of ``niche'' audiences, when every fractionalized demographic in
the nation is pandered to by its own cable channel, ``Millionaire''
is gathering Americans from all walks of life around the electronic
hearth in the way ``I Love Lucy'' once did. Low-attention-span kids
and surly teenagers watch. Parents watch. The elderly watch. Who
could imagine a happier ending to our long siege of White House sex
scandal and workplace massacres? At last, a G-rated cultural value
that unites the entire American family _ greed!
</P>
<P>
   All brought to us by the wonderful world of Disney Co., which
has finally found a dirt-cheap entertainment formula that pleases
Wall Street without offending any major faith. If you can find a
link on the ABC Web page that doesn't lead to a ``Millionaire''
promotion, jokes veteran Hollywood agent Bernie Brillstein, ``the
site it takes you to has Walt Disney turning over in his grave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come to a tough moment at the end of the millennium,''
said Rosalyn Weinman, an NBC executive who holds a doctorate in
sociology. ``All the stuff our parents told us didn't come true. No
one cares if you're good. People only care if you're good-looking
and rich.'' Not that NBC won't try to get its share in a gold rush:
the network is shamelessly scrambling to bring back ``Twenty-One,''
its own notorious contribution to the 1950s quiz-show scandals. How
will the new ``Twenty-One'' be different from the old? I asked Fred
Silverman, who is readying the retread in Los Angeles. ``The first
thing,'' he replied, ``is that it is not going to be fixed.'' The
second: ``more accessible'' questions.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the '50s it was the young congressional investigator
Richard Goodwin, on his way to the Kennedy White House, who led
contestant Charles Van Doren, the star fraud of ``Twenty-One,''
into a Washington hearing room to confess to a disillusioned
nation. At my urging this week, Goodwin watched an episode of
``Millionaire'' and then sounded almost nostalgic for Van Doren,
who, though fed questions in advance, was at least a bona fide
egghead. Goodwin thought ``Millionaire'' was ``a joke'' and has no
use for its dumbed-down questions. ``In the '50s,'' he said, ``we
cited these contestants as examples of how we were intellectually
ahead of the Russians. The shows were designed to create heroes,
people to admire and look up to for their learning and knowledge.
Now they're trying to make audiences feel better about
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The return of the quiz-show craze in the late '90s, Goodwin
added, suggests a parallel between now and the '50s, another
prosperous ``time of dullness'' with ``really intense public apathy
and little ferment over public issues.'' And certainly ``Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire'' gains intellectual heft when compared with
the current political culture's debate over Al Gore's wardrobe. Yet
affluent as the '50s were, they are nothing next to our current
boom, which rivals the late-19th-century Gilded Age in terms of its
creation of fabulous wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain called the Gilded Age a time of ``money-lust.'' This
week terms like ``voyeurism'' and ``vicarious orgasms'' and
``ecstasy'' kept popping up when I canvassed people about the late
1990s appeal of ``Millionaire.'' In this sense, the new quiz shows
were a phenomenon waiting to happen; they're the giddiest
manifestations yet of a culture that offers a pornography of wealth
almost everywhere you look.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what's it like to be worth $400 million when you're 27
years old?'' asked Fortune in its cover story on ``The Young and
the Loaded,'' one recent example culled from the avalanche of media
celebrations of dot-com zillionaires. (Answer: darned good.) The
new Esquire features a first-person confession by an anonymous,
freshly minted millionaire exulting in his financial virility in
the same terms that men's magazines once celebrated sexual prowess.
</P>
<P>
   To up the ante on ``Millionaire'' the night of its debut this
month, ABC led into it with ``Annie,'' the musical about the
Depression-era orphan who finds happiness in the loving arms of the
eponymous Daddy Warbucks. ``The richest night of television!'' is
how the network promoted the double bill. Further gilding the
already gilded lily are the relentless commercials on
``Millionaire'' for eTrade, which not only invites viewers to play
the market but to enter a sweepstakes that will award a million to
the entrant who correctly guesses the Dow Jones average at year's
end.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   If this country is so rich, why are so many coveting prosperity
they already have? The answer is that most people don't have it,
and the gap between the haves and the have-nots _ and between the
haves and the middle class _ is growing. While nearly half the
country invests in stocks, 90 percent of the shares are held by the
wealthiest 10 percent of the households, according to studies cited
by The Wall Street Journal; meanwhile, stock options have pushed
the ratio of executive pay to factory-worker pay from 42 to 1 in
1980 to 419 to 1 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Aldrich Jr., the author of the memoir ``Old Money,'' said
the distribution of wealth among Americans now looks like ``the
pyramid on the dollar bill _ with the top sliced off and floating
up by the transparent eyeball.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans aren't angry about these discrepancies. Politicians
aren't vocal about them, with the fringe exception of Pat Buchanan
_ and Donald Trump, who last week announced a confiscatory tax plan
for the super-rich. Instead of getting riled, have-not and
have-not-so-much Americans are looking for their own financial
scores, especially quick scores. Las Vegas is our fastest-growing
city. Day trading and Internet betting are in the stratosphere.
According to this year's report by the federal commission on the
subject, the national explosion in state lotteries and casinos has
led Americans to spend far more on gambling per year than they do
on groceries. For children addicted to acquisitiveness but not old
enough to put cash on the table, there are chips, in the form of
Pokemon cards.
</P>
<P>
   In the corporate offices of television, where executives have to
worry about when today's hits will fade, there seems to be
unanimity about how the quiz-show fad could burn itself out. ``If
the economy tanks,'' says Dr. Weinman of NBC, ``the whole thing
falls apart. Then you have envy and jealousy.''
</P>
<P>
   She is seconded by the psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers, who in
1955 won a total of $134,000 on ``The $64,000 Question,'' until now
the only quiz show to top TV ratings for a season, and its
offshoot, ``The $64,000 Challenge.'' Reminiscing this week, Dr.
Brothers told of how she spent that long-ago windfall _ a Park
Avenue medical practice for her husband, dishwashers for the rest
of her family _ and also of how warmly the public responded to her
winnings. She feels that the same approval accrues to 1999's
quiz-show victors, at least for now. But in an economic downturn,
she fears, the masses will turn on overnight millionaires who got
``something for nothing'' and ``did no real work.''
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the quiz show scandals in the '50s, John
Steinbeck wrote a letter to Adlai Stevenson that The New Republic
published under the headline ``Have We Gone Soft?'' Steinbeck
wrote, ``If I wanted to destroy a nation, I would give it too much
and I would have it on its knees, miserable, greedy and sick. ...''
</P>
<P>
   But you'll find no such jeremiads here _ or almost anywhere.
Everyone loves Regis, the show is way more fun than Stone and Jane,
and only a millennial-eve party pooper could imagine that the
biggest bubble in the nation's history will ever burst.

FOREIGN AIRLINES INCREASINGLY IN DEMAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Air disasters like the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990
make Americans a bit nervous about foreign airlines _ particularly
the carriers of Third World countries _ but they still clamber
aboard. More and more Americans are using non-American airlines to
reach exotic corners of the world for business and pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Once they get there, they may be putting their lives on the line
by using the domestic airlines in some Third World countries,
especially in the poorest African nations and former Soviet
republics, where maintenance can be sporadic, spare parts
unaffordable, and pilots perhaps too reliant on the proverbial wing
and a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say flying a foreign airline from Boston's Logan
International or any other US airport is no more dangerous than
boarding a US-flagged craft, since foreign airlines flying in and
out of the United States have to meet the same safety standards as
US passenger aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, airline and tourist industry analysts say, crashes
like that of EgyptAir don't seem to have a ``ripple effect'' of
scaring Americans away from the airlines of underdeveloped
countries any more than the crash of a SwissAir plane frightens
them from European airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Americans overwhelming prefer to fly American-based
airlines, but that's mostly a matter of brand-name consciousness or
convenience,'' said David Stempler of the Washington-based Air
Travelers Association. ``They tend to be most nervous about
non-brand-name carriers, whether foreign or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Small but steadily increasing numbers of American travelers
appear to be picking foreign airlines, often because these carriers
make the most direct flights to out-of-the-way destinations. Last
year, 58.5 million travelers flew foreign carriers in or out of the
United States, according to the US Department of Transportation.
That compares with 31.3 million using foreign carriers five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to go to the Philippines, you can board a familiar
American carrier and route through Japan,'' Stempler said. ``Or you
can fly Philippine Airlines nonstop to Manila.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 foreign-based airlines are licensed to carry
passengers in and out of the United States. They range from such
renowned carriers as Dutch KLM and Singapore Airlines to Ghana
Airways and Air Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are the world's top globe-trotters, expected to make
60 million business and vacation trips to foreign countries this
year _ an increase of 13.5 million in just five years.
</P>
<P>
   For service and amenities, front-rank carriers of Europe and
Asia are at least as good and often nicer than those of US-based
airlines. For safety, all airlines touching down in the United
States are equal, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason why Americans should be afraid of small
foreign carriers,'' said Robert Booth of Aviation Managament
Services, a Miami-based aviation consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Big airline disasters invariably create anxiety about flying and
tend to scare away passengers from the airline that crashed _ but
usually only for a month or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a negative impact for four or five weeks, but it
relates to the specific airline,'' said Booth. ``There is simply no
evidence of potential passengers steering away from airlines from
less-developed nations'' after a ``spectacular and awful tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may be wary of EgyptAir for a while,'' he said. ``But
that doesn't mean they are going to avoid Argentina's LAPA or some
other smaller Latin American airline.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts note that two of the three worst air disasters along the
Eastern Seaboard in recent years involved major Western airlines _
the 1996 plunge of TWA Flight 800 off Long Island and last year's
SwissAir Flight 111 tragedy off Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, after an air disaster, there is a heightened
awareness among travelers about air safety,'' said James Ashurst,
spokesman for the American Society of Travel Agents. ``But it
doesn't translate into a raised fear of smaller foreign carriers.
People aren't going to cancel that adventure trip to Vietnam just
because a plane from Egypt met with calamity.''
</P>
<P>
   By and large, foreign carriers flying into the United States
cater primarily to their own nationals or naturalized Americans
from a given country. A majority of EgyptAir's passengers to and
from the United States, for example, are either Egyptians or
Egyptian-Americans, much as Germans prefer Lufthansa or Finns like
Finnair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, Americans will choose a foreign carrier more often
than foreigners will pick an American carrier,'' Stempler said.

US RETRACTS TRANSLATION OF FLIGHT 990 COCKPIT TAPE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL AND MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ US government officials retracted Friday a key
piece of information that had been widely distributed in the wake
of the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, but continued to pursue the
theory that the tragedy was a deliberate act.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to previous reports, the cockpit voice recorder did not
capture a voice identified as that of EgyptAir copilot Gamil El
Batouty saying, ``I have made my decision now'' in the moments
before the jetliner plunged into a steep, rapid dive from 33,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
   In background conversations with reporters in the past week, US
law enforcement officials had said that the phrase, which was
followed by a short prayer in Arabic, was a telling indication that
Batouty, 59, could have deliberately switched off the plane's
autopilot and pushed it toward the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the law enforcement sources and other government
officials sought to correct the record. They now say the recorder
had captured only the prayer, ``I put my faith in God's hands,''
which is a far more ambivalent statement.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, National Transportation Safety Board
Chairman James Hall, alluding to the flap over Batouty's comments,
said in a briefing that the news accounts were ``just flat wrong,''
and condemned the ``reckless'' reporting in the American and
Egyptian press.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB is after the truth, Hall said, and ``we won't get there
on a road paved with leaks, speculation, supposition and spin.''
The Egyptian press and relatives of Batouty and the flight crew
have criticized US officials for jumping to conclusions on the
basis of slight evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite their embarrassment, US officials have not
abandoned their suspicion that the plane crash was not an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hall reiterated in his briefing that the crash ``might _
and I emphasize `might' _ be the result of a deliberate act.'' If
so, Hall said, he is required by international treaties to consult
with the FBI about a possible criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   And sources said that investigators still remain troubled by the
events in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   The Cairo-bound Boeing 767-300ER had taken off from New York's
John F. Kennedy International Airport in the early hours of Oct.
31. It was 30 minutes into the 11-hour flight when it suddenly
began a rapid descent which became steep and fast enough to cause
temporary weightlessness inside the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the jet had struggled out of the dive and
regained some altitude, but began another harrowing nosedive
seconds later, breaking apart and smashing into the Atlantic Ocean
about 60 miles south of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, investigators began to examine data recovered from
the plane's two ``black boxes'' _ the flight data recorder and the
cockpit voice recorder _ to reconstruct the final horrific minutes
of the doomed flight.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence indicates Batouty, a relief pilot who had asked to
fly the first shift, was alone in the cockpit when the prayer was
uttered and the autopilot was disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   Of primary concern to investigators is the fact that there was
no indication of any mechanical problem on the plane before the
autopilot went off, and it apparently was disconnected on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   If the autopilot malfunctioned and disconnected itself,
specialists say, an alarm would have sounded, loudly enough to be
picked up on the cockpit voice recorder; one source said there is
no such sound on the EgyptAir tape. If the switch was thrown off by
accident, the alarm still would have sounded, said a commercial
airline pilot who flies the Boeing 767.
</P>
<P>
   To disengage the autopilot without sounding an alarm, someone in
the cockpit would have had to actively double-click a switch on the
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a more detailed timeline of the last moments of
Flight 990 released by the NTSB Friday ``makes it pretty clear
someone was trying to bring that plane down,'' said an aviation
specialist speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The specialist noted that as the plane went into its steep dive,
the pilot _ believed to be Captain Ahmed El Habashi _ returned to
the cockpit and tried to pull the jet up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pull with me! Help me! Pull with me!'' he exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   But the jetliner's engines were shut down moments later and the
speed brakes _ spoilers on the wings which increase the rate of
descent and make it harder for the plane to climb _ were deployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone was trying to get that plane on the ground as fast as
possible,'' the specialist said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, El Habashi apparently had some success, as the
plane's speed and its angle of descent were reduced at 51 seconds
after the autopilot was disconnected. At that point, however, the
cockpit voice recorder and the jet's flight data recorder both
stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much more to this story than we will ever know,'' the
specialist said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives have described Batouty, 59, a veteran
military and civilian pilot, as a contented man with five children,
including 10-year-old daughter who was being treated for lupus in
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was facing retirement, had never been promoted to
captain and may have been concerned over his daughter's medical
bills, his family insists he loved flying and would never have
deliberately crashed the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Three additional Egyptian representatives arrived from Cairo on
Thursday to help prepare a verbatim Arabic transcript of the entire
cockpit voice recording. When they are finished, an English
translation will be prepared, Hall said. It is expected to take
several days.
</P>
<P>
   The US Navy, meanwhile, has contracted for a salvage ship, the
Smit Pioneer, to be used in recovering wreckage from the airplane.
The ship can load and store large loads, and can remain at sea in
deep water and high seas. It is now in Lisbon and is expected to
arrive off New England around Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder information will be used to program a
Boeing Aircraft simulator in Washington state, where experts will
gather within the next few weeks to run simulations in an effort to
understand the aircraft's behavior.

HOSPITAL BECOMES BONDING GROUND FOR A&AMP;M FAMILY

<P>
   BRYAN, Texas _ When Cheryl Davis learned early Thursday that her
son was among the Texas A&AMP;M students injured when a bonfire log
stack collapsed, she had no great cause to worry.
</P>
<P>
   She had been told that 20-year-old William, a sophomore from
Houston, suffered only a broken arm.
</P>
<P>
   His elbow was, in fact, broken. But when Davis arrived at St.
Joseph Regional Health Center in Bryan, she learned that her son
also had broken bones in his hip, pelvis, legs and face. He also
suffered minor liver injuries, several cracked ribs and a punctured
lung.
</P>
<P>
   Although William Davis was in critical condition Friday and on a
respirator, doctors expect him to recover fully.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surgeon said, `You don't know how lucky your son is,' ''
Cheryl Davis said during a news briefing at the hospital, about
five miles from the A&AMP;M campus. ``Considering he has tubes going
out of his body in every direction and numerous broken bones, I
guess he is.''
</P>
<P>
   William Davis has not been told that 11 fellow Aggies died in
the accident and that 27 others were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Two others remained in critical condition Friday. Tim Kerlee of
Germantown, Tenn., is in the intensive care unit at St. Joseph and
on life support. John Comstock of Richardson, Texas, is in
intensive care at College Station Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The scene inside and outside St. Joseph was tense Friday as
students and parents gathered and visited the injured. For some,
the enormity of the accident was just beginning to sink in.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Shelton of Corsicana, Texas, said the tragedy hit him like
a punch in the belly. Lucas Kimmel, a freshman in Shelton's outfit
in the A&AMP;M Corps of Cadets, was among those killed. And William
Davis is among Shelton's closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two days ago, I was in the hallway talking to Lucas, going to
class with Lucas, going to chow with Lucas. Now he's gone,''
Shelton said as he kept vigil at St. Joseph. ``It's hard. Lucas is
gone, and Davis is hurt real bad in ICU.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, 18, and the throngs of fellow students and Aggie
parents assembled at St. Joseph took comfort in their numbers. The
tragedy has forged an even tighter bond for members of the
close-knit, tradition-bound A&AMP;M family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really unbelievable what's going on up there,'' said
Heather Sustman, a senior from the Houston suburb of Spring.
``People who don't even know each other are giving out hugs and
just being there for them. It's really quiet, but we are all
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Gloria Hutchinson, whose son, Chad, was among those
upgraded from critical to serious condition, are aware of the
prayers and warm wishes extended by what the couple described as
``the Aggie family.''
</P>
<P>
   Chad Hutchinson, a 19-year-old sophomore from Houston, was
working on the highest stack and crashed about 50 feet among the
tumbling logs. His parents said he recalled hearing the ``loudest
pop he's ever heard in his life,'' just before the logs collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hutchinson said his son was alert and concerned about the
other Aggies who had been working in around-the-clock shifts to
build the bonfire framework. The structure was to be set ablaze
Thanksgiving night, the eve of A&AMP;M's annual football game against
the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I visited him for the first time at 8:20 a.m. (Thursday),
he asked, `What happened? Did anybody die?' '' Bill Hutchinson
said. ``I explained to him that, yes, there were some deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   His son took the grim news ``very hard,'' Hutchinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Msgr. John Malinowski, St. Joseph's chaplain, said the people
pulling for the injured survivors are demonstrating a brand of
faith that most Sunday sermons can't match.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Texas A&AMP;M, they are very faith-oriented, and they are not
bashful about showing it,'' Malinowski said. ``That is their
strength, and I do not believe it is wavering.''

THE MANIA OF MOMENTUM AND THE COST OF TRADING

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Phooey on the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   Not about to let Tuesday's interest rate increase stop their
runaway train, stock traders rode the major indexes back into
record territory last week. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 closed near
its high, up 15.68 percent for 1999, while the NASDAQ composite
reached yet another record, up 53.65 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   But if rising interest rates don't seem to faze stock investors,
rising volatility should. While stock prices have been rocketing,
price swings in shares are now approaching levels seen only during
two famous crisis periods: the Russian debt collapse of last summer
and the crash of 1987.
</P>
<P>
   High volatility makes it harder for investors to get in and out
of trades at reasonable prices and therefore raises trading costs.
Although increasing volatility permeates all aspects of the market,
price movements among the largest companies are most disturbing
because they are the ones that investors believe are the safest and
most liquid.
</P>
<P>
   According to Salomon Smith Barney, price swings among the 100
largest stocks in the Russell 1000 index are now averaging 42
percent, annualized, close to the 44 percent during the Russian
crisis and the 46.5 percent endured in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone looks to these companies as being the most liquid,''
said Keith L. Miller, director of United States quantitative
research at Salomon Smith Barney, ``but they're experiencing
greater volatility.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind these swings are high prices _ which leave much room to
fall _ and investor concentration in a handful of growth stocks.
But the mania for stocks that are rising _ known as momentum
investing _ contributes mightily to volatility, too. Online
investors made the technique notorious, but now even pension fund
managers have succumbed to its lures.
</P>
<P>
   Miller likens the role of momentum investing in today's
volatility to the effect that portfolio insurance had on the market
in 1987. That strategy, which increased exposure to the S&AMP;P 500 as
the price rose and lessened it as the price fell, failed because
the market could not absorb the selling when everyone wanted out.
</P>
<P>
   Today, instead of zeroing in on an index, many investors focus
on a small group of individual stocks. These heavily influence the
entire market's volatility, which causes investors to underestimate
the risk in their portfolios, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   That view is echoed in a recent report from Sanford C.
Bernstein, which says that the volatility of the stocks owned by
the typical online investor _ aka momentum players _ is double that
of the broad market. These traders turn over their portfolios at
six to seven times the rate of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that excessive trading almost guarantees subpar
investment performance. Brad M. Barber and Terrance Odean,
professors at the Graduate School of Management at the University
of California at Davis, studied 78,000 households trading stocks
through a large discount broker between 1991 and 1996. Those
trading the most earned annual returns of 11.4 percent, compared
with 18.5 percent among infrequent traders. Frequent traders also
lagged behind the market's return _ 17.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So, frequent traders do poorly in their own accounts and raise
other investors' costs by increasing volatility. Does anybody else
see something wrong with this picture?

US RETRACTS TRANSLATION OF FLIGHT 990 COCKPIT TAPE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL AND MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ US government officials retracted Friday a key
piece of information that had been widely distributed in the wake
of the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, but continued to pursue the
theory that the tragedy was a deliberate act.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to previous reports, the cockpit voice recorder did not
capture a voice identified as that of EgyptAir copilot Gamil El
Batouty saying, ``I have made my decision now'' in the moments
before the jetliner plunged into a steep, rapid dive from 33,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
   In background conversations with reporters in the past week, US
law enforcement officials had said that the phrase, which was
followed by a short prayer in Arabic, was a telling indication that
Batouty, 59, could have deliberately switched off the plane's
autopilot and pushed it toward the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the law enforcement sources and other government
officials sought to correct the record. They now say the recorder
had captured only the prayer, ``I put my faith in God's hands,''
which is a far more ambivalent statement.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, National Transportation Safety Board
Chairman James Hall, alluding to the flap over Batouty's comments,
said in a briefing that the news accounts were ``just flat wrong,''
and condemned the ``reckless'' reporting in the American and
Egyptian press.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB is after the truth, Hall said, and ``we won't get there
on a road paved with leaks, speculation, supposition and spin.''
The Egyptian press and relatives of Batouty and the flight crew
have criticized US officials for jumping to conclusions on the
basis of slight evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite their embarrassment, US officials have not
abandoned their suspicion that the plane crash was not an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hall reiterated in his briefing that the crash ``might _
and I emphasize `might' _ be the result of a deliberate act.'' If
so, Hall said, he is required by international treaties to consult
with the FBI about a possible criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   And sources said that investigators still remain troubled by the
events in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   The Cairo-bound Boeing 767-300ER had taken off from New York's
John F. Kennedy International Airport in the early hours of Oct.
31. It was 30 minutes into the 11-hour flight when it suddenly
began a rapid descent which became steep and fast enough to cause
temporary weightlessness inside the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the jet had struggled out of the dive and
regained some altitude, but began another harrowing nosedive
seconds later, breaking apart and smashing into the Atlantic Ocean
about 60 miles south of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, investigators began to examine data recovered from
the plane's two ``black boxes'' _ the flight data recorder and the
cockpit voice recorder _ to reconstruct the final horrific minutes
of the doomed flight.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence indicates Batouty, a relief pilot who had asked to
fly the first shift, was alone in the cockpit when the prayer was
uttered and the autopilot was disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   Of primary concern to investigators is the fact that there was
no indication of any mechanical problem on the plane before the
autopilot went off, and it apparently was disconnected on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   If the autopilot malfunctioned and disconnected itself,
specialists say, an alarm would have sounded, loudly enough to be
picked up on the cockpit voice recorder; one source said there is
no such sound on the EgyptAir tape. If the switch was thrown off by
accident, the alarm still would have sounded, said a commercial
airline pilot who flies the Boeing 767.
</P>
<P>
   To disengage the autopilot without sounding an alarm, someone in
the cockpit would have had to actively double-click a switch on the
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a more detailed timeline of the last moments of
Flight 990 released by the NTSB Friday ``makes it pretty clear
someone was trying to bring that plane down,'' said an aviation
specialist speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The specialist noted that as the plane went into its steep dive,
the pilot _ believed to be Captain Ahmed El Habashi _ returned to
the cockpit and tried to pull the jet up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pull with me! Help me! Pull with me!'' he exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   But the jetliner's engines were shut down moments later and the
speed brakes _ spoilers on the wings which increase the rate of
descent and make it harder for the plane to climb _ were deployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone was trying to get that plane on the ground as fast as
possible,'' the specialist said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, El Habashi apparently had some success, as the
plane's speed and its angle of descent were reduced at 51 seconds
after the autopilot was disconnected. At that point, however, the
cockpit voice recorder and the jet's flight data recorder both
stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much more to this story than we will ever know,'' the
specialist said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives have described Batouty, 59, a veteran
military and civilian pilot, as a contented man with five children,
including 10-year-old daughter who was being treated for lupus in
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was facing retirement, had never been promoted to
captain and may have been concerned over his daughter's medical
bills, his family insists he loved flying and would never have
deliberately crashed the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Three additional Egyptian representatives arrived from Cairo on
Thursday to help prepare a verbatim Arabic transcript of the entire
cockpit voice recording. When they are finished, an English
translation will be prepared, Hall said. It is expected to take
several days.
</P>
<P>
   The US Navy, meanwhile, has contracted for a salvage ship, the
Smit Pioneer, to be used in recovering wreckage from the airplane.
The ship can load and store large loads, and can remain at sea in
deep water and high seas. It is now in Lisbon and is expected to
arrive off New England around Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder information will be used to program a
Boeing Aircraft simulator in Washington state, where experts will
gather within the next few weeks to run simulations in an effort to
understand the aircraft's behavior.

PATRIOTS OUT TO REPAY A DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Ah, fresh meat for the slaughterhouse. The
Patriots defense was frothing over the prospective feast.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino had just left the game that
afternoon of Oct. 17 at Foxboro Stadium after reinforcing two
points: that he is the most prolific passer in National Football
League history, the first to log 60,000 yards through the air; and
that the neck injury that affected his right shoulder was turning
his passes into butterflies. After floating an interception that
New England linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer returned 57 yards for a
touchdown and a 7-0 lead, Marino had been promptly yanked from the
huddle in favor of backup Damon Huard.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Who-ard?
</P>
<P>
   Damon Huard, who took the field with a mere 59,915 fewer career
passing yards than Marino. Damon Huard, an undrafted free agent
from Washington in 1996 who was better known around the NFL for his
lobbying than his lobbing. Damon Huard, who fulfilled the
preconceptions by completing his first pass of the season for a
touchdown _ to New England cornerback Ty Law, who returned it 27
yards for a 14-0 lead just 8:04 into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was going to be a cakewalk,'' recalled Patriots
defensive tackle Chad Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the New England defense experienced famine for the
remainder of the day. Huard left the Patriots aghast by bouncing
back from nine sacks for 53 yards in losses and completing 24 of 40
passes for 240 yards and two touchdowns, including a 5-yarder to
Stanley Pritchett with 23 seconds left that gave Miami a 31-30
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marino's out,'' said Eaton, recreating the recipe for
disaster, ``and we think we have the game won, 14-0. We'd been
preparing all week for Marino, and then in comes a scrambling
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   That performance helped scramble the AFC East, and now the
Patriots would like to do the same to Huard Sunday in Miami _ not
to mention gain a possible share of first place with the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   At least he can't sneak up on them this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' said cornerback Steve Israel, ``is that
we're prepared now. We know he can scramble. We know what kind of
throws he can make.''
</P>
<P>
   And can't make. Huard has been at the controls since the Foxboro
resurrection, guiding Miami to a 4-1 record. While Marino has been
cleared for noncontact work, Huard will start and likely finish. If
it's any consolation to the Patriots, in the lone blemish on his
resume _ last week's 23-3 humbling at Buffalo _ Huard looked more
like the guy who was considered such a hot NFL prospect coming out
of college that he spent a postgraduate year out of uniform as a
successful fund-raiser in the Seattle Seahawks' campaign for a new
stadium. Against the Bills, he completed a mere 9 of 25 passes for
65 yards and led an offense that gouged out the second-lowest total
in franchise annals: 101 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, that's the performance the Patriots would greatly
prefer that he duplicate. But to accomplish that, they must avoid
their sins of a month ago, when the element of surprise, Huard's
innovative knack to create plays on the run, and, in Eaton's view,
the New England defense's complacency combined to do them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have helped if we'd had more awareness that he was
going to take off,'' said coach Pete Carroll. ``I often think
that's the way with young quarterbacks _ they take off and run (if
the pocket evaporates). I wish we'd had more awareness that he
could escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton wishes they'd had more awareness that he could play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to struggle against second-string quarterbacks,'' he
said, referring to Monday's 24-17 loss to Ray Lucas and the New
York Jets as further evidence. ``Maybe it's that we're a young
team. This team has to play every game like it's the Super Bowl.
Maybe we don't know how to finish yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret to finishing Huard is not to let him improvise. In
theory, that applies to any mobile quarterback. ``The problem is
particularly this: A normal play gets called with a normal rhythm
to it,'' said Carroll. ``Then the quarterback has the opportunity
to step out and a new play starts. It can be like a quarterback
draw or a quarterback rollout or it can be just that he moves and
finds the (receiver).''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Huard ever would be mistaken for Kordell Stewart
or Lucas or Doug Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have great speed,'' said Carroll. ``The phrase I
like to use is resourcefulness. He sees the play isn't working out,
tends to find a way out, and he's effective. Speed is not as
important as finding a way out.''
</P>
<P>
   To counteract that, defensive tackle Henry Thomas knows, the
Patriots must ``be more conscious of closing off the passing lanes
and his ability to make big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   This was all news to them Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew nothing about the guy before he came in,'' said
linebacker Chris Slade. ``I didn't realize he was as good as he
was. I was impressed with the way he carried himself on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Patriots would like to make a belated impression on
Huard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to pay him back,'' said safety Lawyer Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   They know they owe him.

CUBA AND VENEZUELA ENGAGE IN A DIFFERENT KIND OF DIPLOMACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Tension shot through the crowd as Fidel Castro dealt
with his latest international crisis. He huddled with his closest
advisers as his Venezuelan opponents flicked away Cuban
projectiles.
</P>
<P>
   It had become a missile crisis. Worse yet, it was only the top
of the first, and the Cuban pitcher was throwing duds that had put
two men on base with no outs.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban president became the maximo manager on Thursday night,
guiding a Cuban team against a Venezuelan lineup whose leader and
pitcher was none other than President Hugo Chavez. In this
baseball-crazy country, the game drew 25,000 spectators to the
Latin American Stadium here, where they cheered, clapped and beat
drums whenever either side punched a hit or scored a run. Of
course, it didn't hurt that the Cuban team eventually won, 5-4 in a
game that was anything but a pitching duel, with a total of 28 hits
for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The teams were composed of former players from both countries'
national teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro appeared enthralled with Chavez, smiling paternally and
hugging the Venezuelan leader, who was elected president last year
after leading a failed military coup in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who is a lefty, had come to Havana this week to attend a
summit meeting of the leaders of 21 Latin American nations and
Spain and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders spent much time together, touring the city and
talking about issues of mutual concern, including the possibility
of Venezuelan help in rebuilding a Cuban oil refinery that is a
Soviet-era holdover.
</P>
<P>
   Their meeting also conjured up the words of Yogi Berra: ``It's
deja vu all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are, four years, 10 months and 27 days since I last
visited Havana,'' Chavez said in a speech at the University of
Havana earlier on Thursday. ``Fidel and Hugo. Cuba and Venezuela.
More alive than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   During the game, the crowd inside the stadium appeared enamored
of the show of solidarity between the two countries, waving the
Venezuelan colors as if it were Visiting Team Flag Day. Even the
scoreboard was a revolutionary reminder emblazoned with the name
C-H-E _ although in this case it was purely coincidental, since the
letters stood for carreras, hits and errores, Spanish for runs,
hits and errors.
</P>
<P>
   A guaguanco rhythm _ the percussive heartbeat of Cuban music _
echoed inside the stadium as the spectators slapped congas and rang
cowbells.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about brotherhood between Chavez and Fidel,'' said
Rene Pinton, a retired welder. ``The Cuban revolution and the
Venezuelan revolution. The North Americans are against that. They
do not like anything that helps the little guy. They only want to
live well and let the others fall. Cuba could benefit from being
friends with Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   The game itself had been the talk of Havana for days, with
people wondering who would win and what political implications the
game might have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba has always been the macho of baseball,'' said Pinton.
``The world comes here to see us.''
</P>
<P>
   And some of the nation's best players leave to see the world.
The defection of top players like Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez,
who now plays for the New York Yankees, was a sore topic among some
in the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a debt to Cuba,'' said Vladimir Rives, a college
student. ``He had a free education. They taught him baseball here,
even though nobody knew then if he was going to be good or bad. Now
he is not grateful. In this world, a lot of people lose their mind
when they see dollar signs. They lose their shame.''
</P>
<P>
   In a pregame speech at the University of Havana, Chavez peppered
his remarks on his rise to power with jokes about how the Cubans
were trying to psyche him out before the game. He said that the
night before, Raul Castro, the minister of defense, had told him he
had to climb 10 flights of stairs because the electricity had
short-circuited. ``When it got to the top, the power was
restored,'' he said. ``I don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   With a smile, he suggested that he had taken a page from
Castro's playbook, delivering a 90-minute speech intended to keep
Castro from eating lunch and discussing strategy with the Cuban
team.
</P>
<P>
   But he concluded, ``Every hit that I allow will be received with
great affection. Each step, swing and play will be a golden grain
in this mission to unite our two people. So, Cuba and Venezuela
will both win.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while , it looked as if that would happen in the game,
too. The score was tied at four each.
</P>
<P>
   As a pitcher, Chavez had control problems. (He almost beaned
several Cuban batters.) But his delivery improved during the five
innings he spent on the mound before he switched to first
base.Chavez also got a hit in his first at-bat, stopping the game
for a minute as he hugged the pitcher. At the end of five and a
half innings, the game was tied 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier in the day, Castro hinted that he had a few
surprises in store. He revealed them in the bottom of the sixth
inning, sending in a string of pinch hitters who were simply
introduced as ``reserves from the Cuban team.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd roared as men , bearded, white-haired and carrying
cantilevered beer bellies, limped to the plate and delivered some
timely hits. The men were active members of the Cuban national
team, sluggers much admired by Chavez, who happily watched as the
Cuban team pulled ahead by one run.
</P>
<P>
   Castro laughed in the dugout as his nation's top players faked
being over the hill.
</P>
<P>
   That one run won the game for the Cubans. After the game's
conclusion, as the players took pictures of one another and Castro
signed baseballs, one of the Cuban ringers watched from the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was exciting for both of us,'' said Orestes Kindelan, 35,
who has hit 550 home runs in his career. ``I did not bat against
Chavez, but those who did said that although he threw it slow, it
got around.''
</P>
<P>
   And his team's manager?
</P>
<P>
   ``Excellent,'' he said. ``He is always planning something. And
luckily, it always turns out good.''

NEW BUILDING CODES HELP REDUCE ISLAND DAMAGE FROM LENNY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. CROIX, Virgin Islands _ As a charter helicopter spirited a
team of government officials up for an aerial view of the damage
caused by Hurricane Lenny, Colonel Gene Walker shouted over the
roar of the propeller blades, ``You're in for a real ride, folks.''
</P>
<P>
   With Lenny whirling about 160 miles east, its winds bounced the
chopper from side to side _ giving a taste of what the hurricane
was like when it hovered near the island a day earlier. But the
damage Walker witnessed a few hundred feet below brought a sigh of
relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad. Not bad at all,'' said Walker, the director of the US
Virgin Islands Territorial Emergency Management Agency. ``This is
nothing compared to Hugo.''
</P>
<P>
   A partially ripped cruise ship pier. Damages to the St. Croix
Yacht Club. A dozen splintered Catamarans bobbing near the coast.
An occasional strewn aluminum roof.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Lenny was merciful. It was tamer than Hugo, the 1989
Category 5 storm that hammered the island with 160 &UR;  &LR; mph winds.
Lenny was a Category 4 storm with winds reaching 135 mph on St.
Croix, but officials believe the limited damage reflected the
upgraded building codes as well as the weaker winds.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere along the Caribbean, government agencies worked around
the clock Friday, assessing the damage, and restoring power to
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were reported killed in Dutch St. Maarten _ two
people struck by flying debris late Thursday and a third who died
when the hillside road on which he was driving collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny's winds and rain and the resulting flooding and storm
surges also were blamed for two deaths in Colombia, one in Puerto
Rico, and one in Martinique. Two people were missing and feared
dead in Dominica.
</P>
<P>
   The US Coast Guard rescued a St. Martin man on Thursday who
survived two days in a life raft buffeted by more than 100 &UR;  &LR; mph
winds and waves as high as 30 feet. But a companion who was with
the man died.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary reports suggest the island shared by St. Martin and
St. Maarten was worst hit. But emergency officials could not fly
onto the island because of the still raging storm.
</P>
<P>
   Ilona Greenstein, a spokeswoman at the Dutch Consulate's office
in Curacao, said Friday little news had come out of St. Maarten.
She said she had heard that the landing strip at the airport had
been ripped up. She said because of downed telephone and electrical
power, calls and e-mail could not get through.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't even get through to people with cell phones,''
Greenstein said. ``Until the storm passes, there's no way to get
communication.''
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists at the National Weather Service in San Juan said
the storm will continue to drift east-northeast, into the open
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   As it drifts away, islanders were counting down to Nov. 30 _ the
last official day of the hurricane season _ while residents of St.
Croix sung the praises of fortified homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, people built to have a home. Now, they're building for
hurricanes,'' said Eric Mills, a taxi driver.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly due to a 1997 law, which required homeowners to
upgrade their roofs to US building codes, said Vargrave Richards,
president of the Virgin Islands Senate. Roofs cannot hang far over
the exterior of houses. Overhung roofs are attractive, but when
winds swirl underneath they can hack off pieces more easily, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Hugo caused as much destruction as it did _
destroying scores of homes, including a mountainside villa owned by
former New York Representative Geraldine Ferraro _ is because
islanders had foresaken strong homes for beautiful ones.
</P>
<P>
   It had been 61 years since a major storm passed through the
island, so when Hugo hit, it surprised lifelong residents. But they
soon learned that Hugo was not an anomaly. Five years later, in
1994, Hurricane Marilyn devastated neighboring St. Thomas, another
US Virgin Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too many hurricanes for such a small territory,''
Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   Those storms have hurt the tourism business, which is the
lifeblood of St. Thomas, and is a major industry in St. Croix and
St. John.
</P>
<P>
   It has also led to a population decline, Richards said. Some
residents who had never experienced a major hurricane left because
they figured it was getting worse. But that isn't the case; weather
patterns just happened to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning how to cope,'' said Richards, one of the
officials who took the helicopter ride. ``This has been a
demonstration. We're coming to grips that we live in a zone that
his hurricane-ridden.''

   Pierce Brosnan may be the James Bond of the '90s, but Sean
Connery is still the favorite secret agent, according to our reader
survey. With Brosnan's third film as 007, ``The World Is Not
Enough,'' in theaters this weekend, movie buffs are waxing
nostalgic about the early ``Bond, James Bond,'' choosing 1963's
``From Russia With Love'' as their favorite film in a field of 20
titles going back to ``Dr. No'' in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   As for the heir to the role when Brosnan is ready to pass the
martini glass, nominees include Daniel Day-Lewis (``In the Name of
the Father''), Dylan McDermott (TV's ``The Practice''), Ralph
Fiennes (``Schindler's List''), Will Smith (``Independence Day''),
Billy Zane (``Titanic'') and even British TV comic Eddie Izzard.
However, more than anyone else, readers want to see 69-year-old
Connery play Bond at least one more time. As they said in your 1983
return to the spy franchise, Sean, never say never again.

LATEST JUDGE IN MICROSOFT CASE WELL RESPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. and the US Justice Department have agreed to the
appointment of a prominent federal judge to mediate a settlement in
the Microsoft antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   The news that Richard Posner has been appointed to mediate the
case sent Microsoft share prices up sharply in after-hours trading.
The choice of Posner, chief judge of the US Seventh Circuit Court
of Appeals in Chicago, and lecturer at the University of Chicago
Law School, could raise hopes that a serious effort will be made to
settle the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's probably an attempt to have someone whose
opinions will be well-respected,'' said Boston antitrust attorney
Lisa Wood. ``He's a leading antitrust scholar and has a very good
background in economics.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to engage Posner as a mediator came on Thursday,
during a brief meeting between attorneys for Microsoft and the
Justice Department, in the chambers of federal judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson. That meeting came nearly two weeks after Jackson
issued ``findings of fact'' in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In harsh and scathing tones, Jackson declared that Microsoft
holds a monopoly over operating system software for desktop
computers, and that Microsoft uses this monopoly to punish rival
companies, thereby harming consumers. Among other things, Jackson
said that Microsoft added an Internet browser to its Windows
operating system not to benefit its customers, but to crush
competition from rival software maker Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling raised the prospects that Microsoft might face severe
penalties, including a possible breakup of the company into two or
more parts, if it does not settle the case or win it on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson frequently has urged the parties to settle the case
before he issues a final ruling sometime next year. The appointment
of Posner may suggest that both sides are taking the idea more
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time I've ever heard of such a thing in an
antitrust case, but you can count on Judge Posner to be very
wise,'' said Sam Peltzman, an economics professor at the University
of Chicago Graduate School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said a settlement would be
welcomed. ``We think this is a very positive step, potentially, to
reach a positive conclusion in this case.'' But Cullinan also
suggested that Microsoft still will resist any settlement that
would limit the company's ability to make changes in its Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe we are defending a principle in this
case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talimona described Posner as
``a highly respected jurist. We look forward to meeting with him to
discuss ways to address the serious competitive problems identified
in the court's findings of fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft critic Ken Wasch, president of the Software and
Information Industry Association, called the decision to appoint
Posner as mediator ``a very shrewd move by Judge Jackson,'' which
would protect him from claims that he is biased against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   His choice of mediator is a judge with a blue-chip resume. The
60-year-old Posner graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa
from Yale, and first in his class from Harvard Law School, where he
was president of the law review. He clerked for former US Supreme
Court Justice William Brennan and served as assistant to Thurgood
Marshall when he was solicitor general of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Posner is also the author of 30 books, including two this year.
In one of them _ ``An Affair of State: The Investigation,
Impeachment, and Trial of President Clinton'' _ Posner criticized
virtually everyone involved in the impeachment scandal, and
concluded that Clinton was guilty of multiple felonies.
</P>
<P>
   Peltzman, a close friend of Posner, said the judge is ``in the
tradition of Chicago economics.'' The ``Chicago School,'' a group
of economic thinkers associated with the University of Chicago,
favors minimal government intervention in economic matters. Milton
Friedman, winner of the Nobel Prize in economics and a former
professor at Chicago, is its most famous exponent.
</P>
<P>
   But Peltzman said that whatever Posner's personal views, the
judge will be scrupulously fair. ``He's not going to take anything
without a grain of salt,'' Peltzman said. ``He's going to be
skeptical and critical.''

 &HT;    Texas tobacco lawyers forgo claim to fees
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The battle over legal fees in the Texas tobacco
case is all but over.
</P>
<P>
   Private attorneys who won a $17.3 billion settlement for the
state from the cigarette industry in 1998 announced Friday they
were giving up any claim to recovering legal fees _ about $2.3
billion _ from the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unconditional waiver,'' said Michael Tigar, a
former University of Texas law professor representing the private
attorneys, equal to ``the value of a West Texas oil field on a
reasonably good day.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers will still collect about $3.3 billion, paid out over
25 years, from a national fund fed by the tobacco companies.
Because of that long payout period, the $3.3 billion is really
worth only $1.2 billion in today's dollars, Tigar said.
</P>
<P>
   His clients had to choose between accepting the tobacco company
payout or collecting $2.3 billion in legal fees from the state.
However, the amount the tobacco companies must pay each year into
the national fund is capped, and lawyers who settled similar suits
in other states are being compensated from the same fund.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Texas lawyers have collected about $364 million from
the national fund.
</P>
<P>
   Giving up any claim to legal fees from the state, Tigar said,
recognizes that the state's tobacco settlement money was ``designed
to fund programs for children and for health insurance for
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers ``have never wanted to put the state on the hook;
they have said that over and over, and some have doubted their
word,'' Tigar said. ``Today, we make clear that they have kept
their word.''
</P>
<P>
   Tigar spoke at a news conference in Austin but said a motion to
waive his clients' rights to legal fees from the state was filed in
Texarkana, where U.S. District Judge David Folsom, who has overseen
the Texas tobacco case, had given the lawyers until Friday to
decide what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Still active, however, is an investigation by Attorney General
John Cornyn into the handling of the contract under which his
predecessor, Dan Morales, agreed to pay the lawyers 15 percent of
whatever they won from the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The private lawyers previously had been willing to drop their
claim against the state for legal fees only if Cornyn dropped his
investigation, which focuses on unspecified breaches of fiduciary
duty during the tobacco litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the protest of Mr. Tigar and his clients,'' Cornyn
said, ``I have never said that I intended to file a lawsuit against
these lawyers, a civil lawsuit, for breach of fiduciary duty or for
any other reason.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cornyn also said he reserved the ``the full range of legal
options that are available'' to the state once he concludes his
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Tigar said his clients were ready to cooperate with the
investigation under the oversight of Folsom. Cornyn, however, said
there was no reason to involve the federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The private lawyers are Walter Umphrey, Harold Nix, John
O'Quinn, John Eddie Williams Jr., and Wayne Reaud, all of Texas, as
well as Ron Motley of South Carolina, who specializes in tobacco
litigation. The motion filed in Texarkana notes that one of the six
lawyers opposed giving up any claim against the state but does not
say who it was. A spokesman for the lawyers, George Shipley, said
he could not disclose who it was, either.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said the lawyers' decision to give up any claim against
the state was ``a great day for Texas'' and that he was ``very
pleased that the tobacco trial lawyers have finally agreed to do
what they promised to do about one year ago _ and that is, let
Texas taxpayers off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Had they not, he said, ``very important programs, like the
children's health insurance program and various state-funded health
initiatives might have been in jeopardy'' because some of the $17.3
billion would have gone toward legal fees.

BAY STATE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE CREEPS UPWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts' unemployment rate rose to 3.2 percent
last month from 2.9 percent in September, but the number of people
who are working broke yet another record.
</P>
<P>
   An increase in the jobless rate in October was no cause for
concern, the Massachusetts Division of Employment and Training said
in its monthly jobs report. The unemployment rate remained far
below the national rate of 4.1 percent, as it has for 56
consecutive months, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing up the unemployment rate was the addition of 13,000
workers to the labor force as more people declared that they are
seeking employment. The number of people who have jobs also rose in
September by 3,500, to a record 3,182,400, the state said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The labor force did take a big jump this month, and you can
probably attribute it to the economy being strong and more people
being brought into the labor force,'' said Eliot Winer, the
division's chief economist.
</P>
<P>
   Winer also warned that state unemployment data can be volatile
and less reliable than federal statistics, because they are drawn
from a much smaller population pool than are national unemployment
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' service industry, including business and consumer
services, created 3,900 new positions in October, the division
said. Growth in service jobs last month offset losses in
construction and manufacturing and sluggishness in the financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Since October 1998, business services and the high-technology
industries have grown substantially, with payrolls expanding by 3.9
percent and 4.3 percent, respectively. Despite a recent slowdown in
construction hiring, the industry's payrolls have grown 5.8 percent
in the last year.

MEDIATOR IS NAMED TO SEEK MICROSOFT SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Iowa, Conn.)   (bl)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal judge overseeing the Microsoft
antitrust trial named a mediator Friday in an effort to bring about
settlement talks between Microsoft Corp. and its accusers: the
Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative was wholly that of the judge, Thomas Penfield
Jackson, but all sides said they welcomed the move.
</P>
<P>
   No settlement talks had been planned before he surprised the
Microsoft and government legal teams during a conference in his
chambers Thursday by announcing that he planned to name as mediator
Richard Posner, the chief judge for the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals, in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In his order, published Friday, Jackson said that mediation
would be voluntary and nonbinding, and that it was up to Posner,
``acting in a private capacity,'' to schedule any talks. None were
immediately set.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also said the schedule for the trial, which calls for a
verdict as early as February, was not being altered, meaning the
two sides may have as much as 90 days to reach a settlement.
Judging from their public statements, they remain far apart.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's findings of fact in the case, published Nov. 5, were
so heavily weighted against Microsoft that they seemed to leave
little room for settlement negotiations. In the findings, Jackson
found that Microsoft used its monopoly power to threaten and bully
allies and competitors alike, stifling innovation and competition
in the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Friday evening, the Justice Department
said: ``Judge Posner is a highly respected jurist. We look forward
to meeting with him to discuss the severe competitive problems
identified in the court's findings of fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, speaking for all of the states
involved, said: ``We welcome the judge's order. We always have
believed in the mediation process.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft welcomed the news, too, with a different spin. ``We
look forward to working with Judge Posner to find a solution that
is fair to Microsoft, fair to consumers and good for the future of
the high-tech industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's announcement, which was made after the markets closed,
sent Microsoft's stock up sharply. It ended the trading day at $86
but rose as high as $90.97 in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Posner comes to the case with no real power beyond the strength
of his reputation and the need of both sides to show Jackson that
they are being responsive to his initiative. He has no authority to
force the parties to reach a settlement, or to impose one.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers from both sides of the case, and others, describe
Posner as a brilliant jurist, among the most respected in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Fischel, dean of the University of Chicago Law School,
where Posner teaches, calls him ``the single greatest antitrust
scholar and judge of this generation.''
</P>
<P>
   President Ronald Reagan appointed Posner to the court in 1981.
At the time, he taught law at the University of Chicago _ and still
does, part time. He is also the author of more than 30 books as
well as numerous articles in the scholarly and popular press. His
most recent book, ``An Affair of State,'' published in September,
was about the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So Posner is accustomed to working mornings and weekends, which
Jackson is now asking him to do for this case. Though he has
offered no opinions on the Microsoft case, he has written
extensively about antitrust and once offered the opinion, in a law
review article, that the AT&AMP;T case in the early 1980s was brought
``to a triumphant conclusion'' by the breakup of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The 7th Circuit also has an active mediation program, noted one
lawyer involved in this case, and one rule prevailing there is that
the mediator does not tell the district court judge trying the case
what occurred during the talks. That way, if the talks fail because
of one party or another, it will not prejudice the judge as he
prepares his verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with that background, coaxing the parties to agree
in this case is a leviathan task. Though both sides say they are
open to mediation, the plaintiffs are flush with confidence from
Jackson's findings, and they are calling for a strong remedy. While
Microsoft has said it is open to settlement discussions, it has
essentially ruled out most everything the plaintiffs have said they
are likely to propose.
</P>
<P>
   The last serious settlement negotiations were held in May 1998,
just before the antitrust suits were filed. At that time Microsoft
offered concessions that now seem mild. The company told the
government that to address a complaint from personal-computer
makers, it would allow them to customize the opening screen of
Windows, Microsoft's dominant operating system. But when pressed by
the government a day later, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates said the
company was not willing to consider even that.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, urged on by Jackson, the litigants have held two or
three lackluster meetings, most recently last summer, and none of
these talks has seemed to go any where. Presiding for Microsoft at
those sessions was William Neukom, Microsoft's chief counsel, along
with several lawyers from Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, the firm that
represented Microsoft in court.
</P>
<P>
   For the government, Joel Klein, the head of the Justice
Department's antitrust division presided, accompanied by several
other Justice Department lawyers including David Boies, the lead
lawyer in court, and one or more state attorneys general. The
lineup is likely to be the same for any new talks.
</P>
<P>
   Since the publication of Jackson's findings, the Justice
Department and the states have agreed that any remedy or settlement
must deal in some way with Microsoft's monopoly in personal
computer operating systems _ though no agreement has been reached
in how that would be done.
</P>
<P>
   Under the mildest proposals being discussed, rules would be
enacted that would change Microsoft's behavior while allowing the
company to keep its present structure. Stronger solutions under
discussion, which Microsoft said it would vehemently oppose,
include forcing Microsoft to publish or auction the source code for
Windows _ so other companies could create competing operating
systems _ or breaking up the company.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Time magazine last week, Gates also said he
would not agree to any settlement that deprived Microsoft of the
ability to add anything it wants to Windows or that allowed
computer makers to alter Windows without Microsoft's permission.
</P>
<P>
   Several state attorneys general have said they would be willing
to agree only to one of the stronger remedies, and no settlement is
possible without agreement from the attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who attended
the meeting with Jackson Thursday, and who will likely be a part of
the settlement negotiations, said he was encouraged that the trial
schedule ``will remain in effect'' through the settlement talks
``so there will be no delays.''

TEXAS A&AMP;M TRAGEDY SPURS CONCERN NATIONWIDE

<P>
   Across the nation, college students, holiday revelers and the
officials who regulate them are examining their own bonfire
traditions in the wake of the tragedy at Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   But the towering woodpile at Texas A&AMP;M puts it in a class by
itself, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking almost the size of a high-rise building,''
marveled Louisiana Fire Marshall V.J. Bella. ``I'm going to make
sure we don't have that in Louisiana.''
</P>
<P>
   The tower of logs that collapsed early Thursday, killing at
least 11 people in College Station, Texas, was 40 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   Bella is concerned about the approaching Christmas tradition of
building bonfires along the Mississippi River levee upstream from
New Orleans. ``They light it like a trail, like the trail Santa
would follow,'' Bella said.
</P>
<P>
   The riverside bonfires once stretched as high as the 55 feet
planned for the A&AMP;M bonfire, but the state's levee board now
restricts the height to about half that to prevent damaging the
levee. The deaths at A&AMP;M lead him to believe more restrictions may
be needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unfortunate thing is that it often takes something like
this to make people understand they need some regulations and
codes,'' Bella said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have college bonfires,'' Bella said. ``Thank God we
haven't had that here. We have laws against open burning in the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Houston canceled its traditional Homecoming
bonfire this year because of the drought-related ban on open fires
throughout Harris County. But the Houston university's usual method
of constructing its fire is in contrast to A&AMP;M's tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Workers from Reliant Energy and Houston Lighting and Power sink
three center poles to stabilize the bonfire. The poles are 30 feet
long, and are sunk 10-feet deep, which means the maximum allowed
height on the bonfire is 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students do actually build the rest, but we stack (wooden
shipping) pallets,'' said university spokeswoman Cindy Suggs.
</P>
<P>
   The UH tradition is at least 50 years old, Suggs said, but the
university will review the policies surrounding the bonfire ``to
make sure it's being done safely and to evaluate its value
overall.''
</P>
<P>
   The pallet method of construction is a common denominator for
many college bonfires. Students at the University of California at
Berkeley were planning to light their 15-foot stack Friday night in
anticipation of Saturday's grudge match with Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike Texas A&AMP;M, we don't use individual pieces of wood,''
said Berkeley spokeswoman Marie Selde. ``The bonfire is constructed
out of wooden shipping pallets, nailed together to form a base
structure. On top of that is placed another cube of pallets nailed
together and hoisted up by the students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consequently, nobody is up on top of the structure,'' Selde
said. ``We have to keep our fire highly controlled because of the
fire danger in the Berkeley Hills.''
</P>
<P>
   Students at Stanford lit their bonfire Thursday night at a
spirit rally where participants observed a moment of silence for
the dead and injured at Texas A&AMP;M. It was, by their own
description, a ``minuscule'' bonfire standing maybe four feet tall
and producing flames about 20 to 30 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have big ones,'' said university spokesman Jack
Hubbard. ``But not Texas-sized _ we didn't kill 7,000 trees. It was
stopped not for safety considerations but environmental
considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   Students at the University of California at Los Angeles burned
their wooden pallet bonfire Thursday night in preparation for
Saturday's game against arch rivals at the University of Southern
California. The pile stood 15 feet high before it was lit, and
students observed a similar moment of silence.
</P>
<P>
   Duke University has a tradition of rowdy bonfires following
major basketball victories. The 1992 rally and bonfire after Duke
won the NCAA championship turned into a dangerous free-for-all,
with some students running through barricades and then through the
fire.
</P>
<P>
   When Duke returned to the NCAA championship in 1994, the
university refused to allow a bonfire, but the students built one
anyway and several were arrested. Students and administrators have
compromised in recent years, now burning a limited number of
bonfires with permits and supervision from the city fire marshal's
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that sort of struck me this morning was just the
size of the bonfire at A&AMP;M,'' said Duke spokesman Keith Lawrence.
``Its amazing. Not to minimize the danger of any bonfire, but
clearly, the size of our bonfire doesn't come close to what was
under construction there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence said Duke students simply pile up a few benches in the
residential quadrangle and light them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bigger than a typical park bench,'' Lawrence said. ``They
might stack three or four benches and set them on fire. The flames,
when they really get going, can get to maybe 30 to 40 feet high.''

SILENT PRAYERS HONOR BONFIRE VICTIM

<P>
   KELLER, Texas _ In silence, 10 students encircled the flagpole
at Keller High School on Friday morning to begin a prayer vigil in
memory of Chad Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, the 1999 Keller High School valedictorian, was among 11
people killed
</P>
<P>
   early Thursday when a towering log stack collapsed at Texas A&AMP;M
University. The students were building the framework for the annual
A&AMP;M bonfire, the highlight of preparations for the Aggies' annual
football game against archrival University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Keller residents tried to come to grips with the
community's loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 45 minutes, I'd estimate there were between 800 and 1,000
students around the flagpole,'' said Julie Zwahr, Keller school
district spokeswoman. ``Without saying anything, students would
simply walk up to the circle, drop their books and join hands with
the others.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was time to go to class, staff members quietly ushered
students inside, Zwahr said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the prayer vigil was conducted in silence, a community
gathering Friday night at First Baptist Church of Keller was for
people to ``process and communicate'' their feelings, said J.D.
Tomlin, student minister for the church. Powell, 19, was a First
Baptist member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, it will give a sense of God's presence through this
difficult circumstance,'' Tomlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Powell would have encouraged people to seek God's comfort during
troubled times, Tomlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he embraced his relationship with Christ was evidenced
by the way he lived his life and the way he treated others,''
Tomlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Powell distinguished himself in high school as president of the
National Honor Society and winner of numerous honors.
</P>
<P>
   Adam McGilvray said he watched Powell grow and develop during
high school and came to value his friendship. McGilvray, the
technical media specialist for the district's communications
department, said Powell was Keller High School's ``computer guru.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Powell connected because of their interest in technology
and because Powell continuously volunteered his time at the school,
McGilvray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always remember how he could put his mind to something
and make it happen,'' McGilvray said. ``If he got it in his mind to
do it, or if he needed to do it for someone else, he would do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services for Powell will be at 10 a.m. Monday at Harvest
Baptist Church, 7200 Denton Highway in Watauga, Texas. Burial will
be at Bourland Cemetery in Keller.
</P>
<P>
   The family asked that those who would like to honor Powell make
a contribution to the Chad Powell Memorial Fund at Frost Bank in
Keller. The funds will be used to build a chapel in Bridgeport,
Texas, at the Sid Richardson Scout Reservation for the Boy Scouts
of America.
</P>
<P>
   The Powell family asked that the news media not attend funeral
services or Friday night's community gathering, Zwahr said.

PATRIOTS GAME ESTABLISHED LUCAS IN THE NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The college coach phoned the pro coach, an old friend, and said
he had a kid who could play pro football.
</P>
<P>
   It was two days after the NFL draft, and no one had contacted
the kid. The college coach said the kid was a quarterback, but more
than that, a great athlete who could play some position in the NFL.
But the college coach said he wasn't sure which one.
</P>
<P>
   The kid was sitting in his coach's office, which was several
hundred miles away from Foxborough. The kid got on the phone and
told the pro coach how desperately he wanted to play. The coach
told him to report the next day. The kid said he'd be there in six
hours. Five hours later, the kid had driven from Rutgers, outside
New Brunswick, N.J., to Foxborough and was sitting in front of the
coach. The coach noted the kid was wearing a suit and tie and most
likely had to drive home to put that on before he drove to the
Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   The kid began by saying to the coach: ``I can play quarterback.
I can go right now and play for the Edmonton Eskimos in Canada and
make $30,000.'' The coach tells the kid: ``Good luck in Edmonton.
Let me know how you make out there.'' The kid grows silent. The
coach tells him: ``I'll give you a chance to play here. I don't
know what position. I'll figure that out as we go along. But if you
can make this team, you'll make a lot more than the $30,000 in
Edmonton.''
</P>
<P>
   The kid got out of the chair. He walked in circles in front of
the coach's desk for 15 seconds before accepting the challenge. He
worked hard and made the practice squad. At the end of the year, he
played on special teams in the AFC Championship Game and the Super
Bowl. The coach soon thereafter left Foxborough. The next year, the
kid got cut in New England and rejoined his coach with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   He told the coach once again: ``I can play quarterback in this
league.'' The coach answered: ``OK, I'll give you the shot. But let
me warn you right now, I'll cut you faster as a quarterback than I
would as a special-teams player.'' The kid took the challenge. He
became the third-string QB, until earlier this week, when Ray Lucas
walked into Foxboro Stadium for ``Monday Night Football'' and
walked the talk in leading the underdog Jets to their impressive
upset victory of the Patriots. All of this doesn't mean he's going
to be great, or even good. But he doesn't have to go to Edmonton to
prove anything anymore.

<P>
   Speaking of paying your dues:
</P>
<P>
   Brian White was a fine quarterback at Harvard a dozen years ago
and decided he wanted to do something different than almost all of
his classmates. He wanted to be a football coach.
</P>
<P>
   So, after a year at Fordham getting his first master's degree,
he went to Notre Dame as a graduate assistant and picked up a
second masters, this one in business. After Notre Dame, he got a
paying job as an assistant at UNLV. He then went to Wisconsin to
become the running backs coach, and this year was named offensive
coordinator, coaching a young man named Ron Dayne.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne appears to be a lock to win the Heisman Trophy. Last week,
he broke Ricky Williams's NCAA career rushing record. ``Ron is not
only a great football player, but a great young man,'' says White,
who has never regretted his decision to go into football, even with
a Harvard degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I wake up happy and want to go to work. This is what
is right for me. I'm really delighted for this kid. He deserves
everything he can get. He is going to be a tremendous pro football
player. He's a lot like (Pittsburgh's) Jerome Bettis, only faster.
He loves to practice. He loves to play. He's totally unselfish. He
is the captain of our team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really got upset earlier in the year when Sports Illustrated
said he was one of the 10 most disappointing players of the season.
What are they going to say now? I think they owe him an apology.
There were games this year we were so far ahead at the half, we
didn't play him the second half, or the fourth quarter. He never
said a word, even though he had the chance to get Williams's
record. Nothing was ever selfish about him. It was all about the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   It says here that Brian White _ Harvard degree, two masters
degrees, offensive coordinator of a Rose Bowl team, and in all
likelihood coach of a Heisman Trophy winner (and he isn't 35 yet) _
is going to be a head coach in a big-time program . . . and win.

   NBC golf analyst Johnny Miller, who tells it straight whether
you like it or not, was the last man to win eight tournaments in a
year (1974), until Tiger Woods did it this year. So we called
Miller to ask him how the game has changed. His answer,
surprisingly: not that much, in terms of the players' abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``On average, the courses are about 100 to 200 yards longer now
for these events, and to me, that means probably one stroke per
round. But I think all of the advantages they have now with modern
equipment _ golf balls that go much greater distances; graphite;
titanium; square groves; using lasers to judge the distances to the
pins more accurately _ more than even out for those extra 100 yards
or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger reminds me a lot of Nicklaus. He always seems to be
somewhere near the lead heading into the final days. Jack was that
way. You wouldn't hear anything from him, and then all a sudden,
after just hanging around, here he comes. Tiger is like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger is different than all of the other guys. When he was a
kid, his father, Earl, posted pictures of Jack, and all of Jack's
records, and said this is what they were going after. Tiger was
raised to be super, and he is. I said before he played his first
pro tournament, after he won three US amateurs, that he would win
10 majors, and 50 tournaments, before he is finished. I still don't
know about the majors, but if he stays healthy, and playing the
same way, he isn't going to have any trouble winning 50.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   The supposed inside story goes that Rangers general manager Neil
Smith was so upset when Joe Murphy signed with the Bruins that he
told his equipment managers to throw Murphy's equipment in the
river.
</P>
<P>
   He was serious about getting rid of Murphy's stuff, but the
``river'' was just a figure of speech. But not to the equipment
guy, who did toss one of Murphy's skates into the water and damaged
his sticks. The Bruins are going to pursue any charges with the
league, even though they feel it was a minor league stunt.
</P>
<P>
   They also feel that no lowly equipment man would ever do
something like that unless he had orders from the top. Murphy is
with the Bruins primarily because assistant general manager Mike
O'Connell played with him in Detroit, and felt, for the right
money, he would be a good investment for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the classic case of a guy who got paid too much by his
old club and had to take a lot less to go to his new club,'' said
Harry Sinden. ``And there were a bunch of guys like that this year.
I was talking with Dave Poile, who is running the new team in
Nashville, and he said `that he made a mistake.' He should have
kept six or eight minor leaguers around to start the season, and
then when the six or eight seasoned vets out in the market realized
they had to pay for less, picked up those six or eight guys and
have a better team than he has now.''

   This is where baseball is not smart. The latest figures supplied
by Billy the K out of Peabody, Mass. say that the NBA now has the
most expensive ticket ($48.37 averge) of the four major sports. The
NHL is $45.76, The NFL $45.63, Major League Baseball $14.91. I'd
rather see a Red Sox game over an NBA or an NHL game any day of the
week. Baseball is still the most popular sport here. When you look
at what the Celtics, Bruins, and Patriots get for a ticket, the Red
Sox vastly undersell their product. The Sox think they will have a
new local TV deal in place by Dec. 1, but with the rights going to
a national network rather than a locally owned station . . . Here's
a better baseball All-Star game: the Latin-America team vs. the
rest. That would be better than American vs. National Leagues. In
golf it used to be United States vs. Great Britain for the Ryder
Cup. The event is much better since it switched to US vs. Europe.
My money would go down on the Latin-America team.

   A letter is going out this week from the commissioner warning
the players about unsavory celebratory displays in the end zone
after scoring a touchdown. Keyshawn Johnson's act _ making a
slashing motion across his throat after scoring against the
Patriots Monday night _ did not go over big in NFL headquaters.
Several players have been fined prior to this for acting like
fools, and the commissoner will warn that he is going to get
tougher, and richer, by fining them more often in the future. As
the late, great Paul Brown used to tell his players: ``When you get
to the end zone, act like you've been there before.''

   Hope you didn't miss the story about the University of Kansas
football player, who got stuck in the takeout window of a fast-food
chain, trying to beat up the attendant, only to get arrested and
suspended. It reminds of a retired Globe sportswriter, who told
this story. He was driving home one day, was hungry, and decided to
pull into the drive-through for a quick bite. When he got to the
window, he told the woman, ``I'd like a cheeseburger, fries, and a
milk shake.'' She looked kind of funny at him and said, ``Sorry, I
can't help you.'' Indignant, our man asks ``Why not?'' She replied
evenly, ``Because this is a bank.''

<P>
   Here's the latest in the ongoing soap opera about the famed
Celtics parquet floor. At this point there appears to be a
compromise. The first story had them putting in a new floor. The
second story had them rehabilitating the old floor. The third, and
hopefully final story appears to be some old, some new. Reportedly,
the Celtics and FleetCenter, co-owners of the Celtics' forever home
floor, have decided to do this. An all-new floor will be built for
approximately $200,000 and placed in the FleetCenter as soon as it
is finished. But that will not be the end. The original floor will
be removed. Any part that is deemed reusable will be rebuilt and
brought back at a later date, to become part of the new floor. At
that time, parts of the new floor will be removed and remnants of
the old floor will be blended in, so that the storied past will
always be part of the present. Parts of the old floor that are
simply too far gone will be sold and the money going to charity . .
. OK, so you want to know what Bill Parcells said to Drew Bledsoe
last Monday night, when he put his arm around him and chatted
briefly after the game. Answer: ``Keep going, you can still win it
all.'' And, he meant it.

 &HT;    McCain's budget crusade cuts into Atlanta visit
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) blasted the budget deal
Friday as ``obscene'' pork-barrel politics. Then, the Republican
presidential candidate cut short his day in Atlanta to vote against
the budget in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Having missed more than a third of the Senate's votes this year,
McCain said this was one he would make every effort to cast because
he has been so critical of the special projects that his colleagues
added to the budget in last-minute negotiations with the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earmarking of pork-barrel projects has increased'' since
Republicans took control of Congress in 1995, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan $390 billion agreement passed easily, 74-24.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism of the budget deal meshes well with McCain's
campaign promise to fight against ``special interests'' that he
says dominate politics in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He found a receptive audience at his only public event of the
day, a lunch fund-raiser that drew 75 people to the Capital City
Club.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who turned out were ValuJet founders Lewis Jordan
and Robert Priddy, former Georgia Rep. Harry Geisinger, Atlanta
business executives Charles Ackerman and Fred Halperin and a newly
minted Republican, former state Sen. Steve Langford.
</P>
<P>
   Langford ran for governor last year as a Democrat. ``I was
committed to helping him and I didn't feel I could do that without
making the change,'' Langford said.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, McCain had no formal campaign organization in
Georgia. Its March 7 primary makes the state less important to
McCain than the early primaries in South Carolina and New
Hampshire, where another new poll showed McCain in a dead heat with
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that his performance in Georgia would in large
part be determined by how he does in the first votes. ``I'm still a
significant underdog,'' McCain said. But he also said that his
campaign ``has fooled a lot of people'' with its strong early
showing in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   State GOP Chairman Charles ``Chuck'' Clay, neutral in the race,
attended the McCain event and said he detects a lot of respect for
the former Navy pilot and prisoner of war. ``But people want is for
him to prove he can win,'' Clay said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Georgia's Republican leadership is supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those at the lunch brought copies of ``Faith of My
Fathers,'' McCain's best-selling memoir. McCain, in fact, spent the
week mixing campaign stops with book signings and media interviews
to promote the book. He canceled a planned appearance at an Atlanta
Chapter 11 Books so that he could return to Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress completed its work on the budget Friday
night, ending a year of political gridlock and breaking, for the
second consecutive year, the spending limits that lawmakers set for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate sent President Clinton the last spending bills in a
budget that includes $17 billion more for the military and $2.3
billion more for medical research than last year, both of which
were sought by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The budget frees money to pay $351 million of the $926 million
in back dues to the United Nations and offers 41 of the world's
poorest countries some relief from their debts, which President
Clinton fought for over the Republicans' objections.
</P>
<P>
   And after 10 days of intense negotiations, the budget also gives
Clinton most of the money he wanted for hiring primary school
teachers and local police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's final passage Friday night of five spending bills
totaling about $386 billion came on a 74-24 vote, and without
debate. Forty-two Republicans and 32 Democrats voted for the
measure. Twelve Democrats and 12 Republicans voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   With this vote approving the last major legislation that
Congress will handle before adjourning this year, the lawmakers
completed the last piece of a budget for federal agencies totaling
about $610 billion, 50 days after the new fiscal year began Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office said Friday night that it was
still calculating the budget's bottom line. But it is roughly $30
billion more than last year and $30 billion beyond the spending
limits for this year imposed by law in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The omnibus spending package of five spending bills that passed
Friday night also contains a last-minute across the board spending
cut negotiated by the White House and the Republican leaders in
Congress. It requires federal agencies to cut 38 cents out of every
$100 in their budgets, yielding about $1.3 billion for the 2000
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the spending cut, the budget would require using about
$15 billion from the Social Security surplus, according to the most
recent figures available from the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans claim, however, that the budget does not touch
the retirement reserves, and they have made a political slogan out
of their stance on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the claim rests on a variety of accounting devices. Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla., characterized them as ``an avalanche of budget
gimmickry,'' on the Senate floor Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if tax revenues exceed expectations this year, the claim
might in fact turn out to be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the final assessment is made next May, we'll know for
sure,'' the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were there some budget processes used this year that affected
the bottom line's appearance?'' Lott asked. ``Yeah. Was that new?
No.''
</P>
<P>
   The final budget package approved Friday night by the Senate
includes these five bills in one:
</P>
<P>
   _ A $315 billion measure for the Departments of Health and Human
Services, Labor and Education. Of that sum, $229 billion was for
mandatory programs like Medicare and Medicaid, while the remaining
$86 billion was for programs like medical research, special
education and job training.
</P>
<P>
   _ A $39 billion measure for the Commerce, Justice and State
Departments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two $15 billion bills, one for the Interior Department, one
for foreign aid, as well as a fifth $429 million bill for the
District of Columbia that includes $576 million in emergency
assistance for flood victims of Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Republican senator, John McCain of Arizona, a
candidate for his party's presidential nomination, had said all
week that he would vote against the budget package because it was
``riddled with gimmicks and pork.'' McCain, despite his long years
in Congress, has been running as a maverick and Washington
outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, as the Senate held up the roll call for missing
senators who had anticipated a much later vote, McCain, out of
breath, raced onto the Senate floor, fresh off a plane from a book
tour promoting his autobiography, to vote against the omnibus
budget bill. The roughly $610 billion in spending for federal
agencies represents slightly more than one-third of the overall
federal budget, which is $1.75 trillion. Most of the rest of the
money goes for mandatory programs like interest on the government's
debt, Medicare and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The final budget package also contained a measure that lets
satellite companies broadcast local network affiliates _ channels
carrying local news, sports, weather and other programs _ j as
their rivals in the cable television business do.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also gave final congressional approval to legislation
extending a variety of expired tax breaks, including one that gives
companies a tax credit for their research and development expenses.
The tax benefits add up to $18.3 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The tax bill contained two unrelated measures. One expands
Medicare and Medicaid so that disabled people can return to work
without losing their health benefits. The other would delay for
three months new federal rules on how human organs are distributed
for transplants. The purpose of the delay is to give Congress time
next year to overturn the rules if it chooses to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate separately approved a new law intended to change the
ways sweepstakes companies can entice people to buy magazines and
other goods with promises of winning large cash prizes.
</P>
<P>
   It says companies like Publishers Clearing House cannot send
letters saying someone is ``a winner'' unless they really have won
something. The companies must also clearly inform people that their
chances of winning a prize do not increase if they buy something.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted on the budget bill after a long filibuster by
Midwestern senators over milk legislation evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Herb Kohl, D-Wis., they argued against extending the life
of a milk producers' cartel in Northeastern states, which they say
hurts dairy farmers in their states.
</P>
<P>
   They threatened to block the final budget package and to keep
the Senate in session around the clock, with tactics including
reading aloud from cookbook recipes containing cheese. But they
backed down after Lott promised that the Senate would consider the
issue next year.
</P>
<P>
   As the senators finished voting and after a round of handshakes,
backslapping and, among Democrats, a few high-fives, the chamber
slowly emptied out and fell silent.

ALEXANDER LIBERMAN, 87, LEGENDARY EDITOR AND ARBITER OF TASTE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alexander Liberman, the dominant creative force at Conde Nast
Publications for more than half a century and one of the most
influential and glamorous editors in America, died Friday at Mount
Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. He was 87 and had homes in New
York and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Russian-born Liberman considered himself first an
artist and second a magazine editor and designer, it was his
extraordinary career at Conde Nast, first as art director for Vogue
and later as editorial director for all the company's magazines,
that gave him his power and reach. From the time he arrived at
Vogue in 1941, having just fled occupied France, he brought a
modern sensibility to fashion journalism that would remain with him
through his life.
</P>
<P>
   His determination to replace the hauteur of Vogue with a sense
of freedom and informality helped change the way American women saw
themselves. He wanted to embolden design and to break away from
artifice, so he brought in younger photographers who shot outdoors
in natural light. ``No more Ophelias dancing through the Plaza at
dawn,'' he said. In time, as Amy Spindler, now the style editor of
The New York Times Magazine, observed, ``No man in the Western
world held more power over the fashion images men and women saw
than Liberman during his tenure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He responded so intuitively and so sensitively to changes of
every kind _ changes in social attitudes as well as changes in
photography and art and visual communication _ that he always
seemed to be one or two jumps ahead of everyone else in his field,
and because of this, the magazines he directed stayed fresh and
innovative and very much alive,'' Dodie Kazanjian and Calvin
Tomkins wrote in their 1993 biography, ``Alex.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Vogue, the magazines published by Conde Nast over
the years were Vanity Fair, Glamour, House &AMP; Garden (known for a
period as HG), Mademoiselle, Bride's, GQ, Self, Gourmet, Conde Nast
Traveler, Woman, Details, Allure, Architectural Digest and Bon
Appetit.
</P>
<P>
   An elegant, courtly man who always wore gray suits to the office
with pale blue shirts and narrow hand-knit navy silk ties, Liberman
inspired both adulation and terror among editors and art directors.
From 1960 to 1994, in his position as editorial director of all
Conde Nast magazines, he had the final word on virtually all
editorial matters from captions to covers.
</P>
<P>
   Some editors loved working with him, appreciating the sureness
of his judgment and the authority of his eye, as well as his
constant desire to experiment. Others _ wary of his famous icy
glance _ quaked as he tore up layouts and substituted covers at the
last minute. ``Dear friend,'' he would say, ``don't you think it
might be better this way?''
</P>
<P>
   Several editors and art directors learned to their dismay that
the price of disagreeing with the Silver Fox, as Liberman was known
within the company, could be dismissal from Conde Nast, although he
himself never did the firing and differences with him were rarely
stated as the reason for the dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   Liberman's remarkable tenure stemmed in great part from the
close personal and working relationships he established with the
succession of men who headed the company, starting with Conde Nast
himself. The closest of these relationships was with S.I. Newhouse
Jr., who started work in 1961 in the company acquired by his father
the previous decade and who was appointed chairman in 1975. In a
note to Liberman on his 80th birthday, Newhouse referred to their
relationship as ``the most meaningful experience of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberman was eventually recognized by many critics as a
significant painter. But even though his work came to be exhibited
by art dealers like Larry Gagosian, Betty Parsons and Andre
Emmerich, his reputation was always somewhat tainted by his
position at Conde Nast. Some critics found it difficult not to be
dismissive of an artist who was so prominent a figure in the world
of glitz and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Liberman was born in Kiev, Ukraine, on Sept. 4, 1912, to a
wealthy timber merchant and his wife, and lived a coddled,
luxurious life until the Russian Revolution erupted in 1917. Life
became so stressful that when Alex was 9 his father asked to take
the boy with him on a trade mission to London; the request was
taken up before the Politburo and received the approval of Lenin.
</P>
<P>
   The young Alex spent the next three years in London and attended
English boarding schools, where he learned good table manners,
self-discipline and the English language, all of which would serve
him well for the rest of his life. In 1924 he moved with his mother
to Paris, where he lived on and off for the next 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   He studied painting and architecture at the Ecole des Beaux Arts
and began his journalistic career at Vu, a photographic newsweekly
and prototype of Life magazine. It was owned by Lucien Vogel, who
would one day introduce him to Conde Nast. In 1936 he married
Hildegarde Sturm, a German model and skiing champion. A year later
she walked out on him and they were eventually divorced.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938 Liberman was reintroduced to Tatiana Iacovleva du
Plessix, a blond Russian emigre he had known when he was younger.
The two soon became lovers. Two years later her husband, Count
Bertrand du Plessix, an early Resistance hero in World War II, was
killed when his plane was shot down. A beautiful and imperious
woman who had once been engaged to the Russian poet Vladimir
Mayakovsky, she had survived starvation when she was a girl by
reciting Pushkin to Bolshevik soldiers in return for potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing the Nazis, Liberman, Tatiana and her 10-year-old
daughter, Francine, escaped through Spain and Portugal and sailed
to New York in 1941. Through Vogel, then a consultant at Conde
Nast, Liberman went to work in the art department of Vogue. It was
the start of a legendary career that brought Liberman not only
recognition and wealth but also enabled him to marry Tatiana, who
became a hat designer for Henri Bendel and then for Saks Fifth
Avenue, as Tatiana of Saks.
</P>
<P>
   The critics were far more receptive to Liberman's sculpture than
his painting. His sculptures, fashioned from gas storage tanks and
old boilers, appear in parks, shopping malls and college campuses
throughout this country and abroad, making him one of the most
prolific public sculptors of his time. Robert Hughes, art critic at
Time and a Vogue contributor, called the welded-steel sculptures
Liberman's most important work, describing them as ``of real
importance in recent American sculpture.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberman was also a serious photographer. In the 1940s and '50s,
he photographed Braque, Matisse, Utrillo, Rouault, Brancusi,
Chagall and Picasso, among others, for a book of photo essays,
``The Artist in His Studio.'' He was also the author of ``Greece,
Gods and Art''; ``Marlene: An Intimate Photographic Memoir,'' about
Marlene Dietrich; ``Campidoglio,'' a book of photographs taken over
20 years showing the Roman capitol designed by Michelangelo; and
``Then: 1925-1995,'' a retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 his wife, Tatiana, died. The next year he married
Melinda Pechangco, the nurse who had attended Tatiana in her last
illness. In addition to his wife and stepdaughter, of Warren,
Conn., Liberman is survived by two stepgrandchildren.

ISTANBUL MEETING ENDS WITH NEW LIMITS ON ARMS, MILD STANCE ON
CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also EUROPE-SCENE) 
(js) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ World leaders ended a 54-nation summit
meeting on European security Friday with the adoption of stiff new
limits on the size of conventional armaments in Europe, and a new
charter proclaiming that local conflicts were the legitimate
concern of all European states.
</P>
<P>
   But the main issue under discussion at the meeting of the
Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, Russia's war in
Chechnya, yielded only a call for a political settlement and
agreement on a future visit by an official of the organization
despite the criticism participants had heaped on Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   After a fiery defense of Russia's offensive against its maverick
province by President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday, Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov said the timing of the visit by the organization's
envoy, Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek of Norway, was still to be
negotiated. Ivanov said he would be allowed to visit only areas
controlled by the Russian military, ``because we don't want him to
become a hostage.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, President Clinton declared himself encouraged by Russia's
acceptance of an organization visit and of the new charter: ``We've
got a lot of turns in the road in Chechnya before it's resolved,
but I would say that compared to how things were when we all got
here, those are the two things that I'm hopeful about.''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany called the outcome a
``respectable compromise,'' saying there had been moments when the
summit meeting seemed about to collapse. He also noted that hard
bargaining over the terms of the visit remained to be done with
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov also joined Clinton and the leaders of 28 other nations
in signing an updated agreement setting limits on conventional
weapons in Europe. But the Russian acknowledged that his country
would not meet the new limits until after its operations in the
Caucasus were concluded.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton said he would not present the accord to
the Senate until after the Russians came under the limits and the
fighting in Chechnya had ceased. Nonetheless, the new treaty was
seen as a significant adaptation to the new realities of
post-communist Europe. It cuts ceilings on tanks, combat vehicles,
artillery and combat aircraft by about half from those set in 1990,
when the goal was still to restrict the possibility of large-scale
war between NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adapted treaty will place legally binding limits on the
armed forces of every individual country that is party to it, from
the Atlantic to the Urals,'' Clinton said after the signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to expanding the original treaty from 20 nations to
30 and reducing the quantities of heavy armament, the new treaty
simplified procedures for inspection and verification. Officials
noted that the new ceilings would not have applied to the NATO
operation in Kosovo because it was mandated by the United Nations
and because Yugoslavia's membership in the Organization for
Security and Cooperation has been suspended since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia came under tough criticism throughout the meeting and
in the final declaration, which said, ``The leaders and people of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia must put the country on the path
toward democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms.'' The United States and leaders of the European Union
also held a demonstrative meeting with Serbian opposition leaders
to underscore the hope for the ouster of President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The new charter adopted by the meeting reflected the lessons of
Kosovo and other internal conflicts that have erupted since the
collapse of communism. It envisioned a new role for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in easing
tensions before they explode into war, including the possibility of
intervening not just in conflicts between states, but within
states.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have witnessed atrocities of a kind we had thought were
relegated to the past,'' the charter declared. ``In this decade, it
has become clear that all such conflicts can represent a threat to
the security of all OSCE participating states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Participating states are accountable to their citizens and
responsible to each other for their implementation of their OSCE
commitments,'' it said. ``We regard these commitments as our common
achievement and therefore consider them to be matters of immediate
and legitimate concern to all participating states.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The document envisioned rapid-response teams that could be
deployed quickly to manage crises.
</P>
<P>
   The final declaration of the meeting, however, was carefully
crafted to avoid directly challenging Yeltsin's impassioned
argument that Russia had every right to battle ``bandits and
murderers'' in its country.
</P>
<P>
   ``In connection with the recent chain of events in the North
Caucasus, we strongly reaffirm that we fully acknowledge the
territorial integrity of the Russian Federation and condemn
terrorism in all its forms,'' the document said. It also said that
``a political solution is essential, and that the assistance of the
OSCE would contribute to achieving that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the language was the
result of ``very long negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to oversell this,'' she said. ``I think that we
accomplished a lot. But this is a longer-term problem. I think that
we need to keep pushing it along. We have been given more tools to
deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   While she and European officials tried to portray Russia's
acceptance of an organization role as a step forward, the outcome
of the summit meeting was heralded in Moscow as a triumph for
Yeltsin. Clinton's remarks, expressing a measure of sympathy for
Russia's plight in Chechnya, were presented as an endorsement of
the Kremlin's policy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov, in an interview on Russian television, called Clinton's
remarks ``not so much a surprise as an important international
support of the resolute fight of the Russian leadership against
terrorism in the North Caucasus.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said the assault in Chechnya would continue
unchanged. Military officials said that Russian troops had
encircled about 80 percent of the capital, Grozny, and that
warplanes continued striking targets Friday, killing 150 rebels.
Those reports could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about the updated Treaty on Conventional Forces in
Europe, U.S. officials said the existing agreement had already
resulted in the destruction of more than 70,000 armaments by
participating countries. The new version was designed to reflect
the world's new political boundaries. Under the old treaty, members
of military alliances had to coordinate their military deployments
with their allies. But three members of the old Warsaw Pact _
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic _ are now members of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The new treaty also strengthens the requirement that host
countries must give consent for the deployment of foreign forces on
their territory. The language was designed to address security
concerns of several former members of the Soviet Union, including
Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   Russia agreed in the treaty to exercise restraint in its future
military deployments near the Baltic states. In signing the
agreement, Ivanov also reached agreements with Georgia and Moldova
to withdraw Russian forces from their territories in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   In refusing to submit the updated treaty for ratification until
Russia complies, Clinton sought to avoid another high-stakes
confrontation with the Senate, which last month rejected U.S.
participation in an international treaty banning nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton said it made sense to enter into the agreement now,
even with Russia in violation. Such clashes are not unprecedented.
Immediately after the treaty on conventional forces was signed in
1991, a dispute broke out over whether some forces in the Soviet
Union should be exempt. The matter was eventually settled between
Washington and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adapted treaty will enhance peace, security and stability
throughout Europe,'' the president said. ``Therefore, it is in
America's national interest to sign it now, and to lock in the
commitment of other nations to its terms. At the same time, in
order to reap the benefits, we must have confidence that there will
be real compliance.''

CONNECTICUT IRS AGENT BECOMES TV MILLIONAIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' the blockbuster quiz show
that has turned the television world on its head, finally delivered
on the promise of its title Friday night, as John Carpenter of
Hamden, Conn., became the first contestant to win $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, which broadcasts the program, said that Carpenter's
windfall is the largest one-time cash prize in TV history,
excluding lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, a 31-year-old revenue officer for the Internal
Revenue Service who grew up in Northampton, Mass., won by providing
the correct answer to this less-than-arduous question, the last in
a series of 15: ``Which of these US presidents appeared on the
television series `Laugh-In': Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy
Carter, or Gerald Ford?'' The answer was Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   But Carpenter, whose occupation as a tax collector earned him
some good-natured boos from the studio audience when he was
introduced this week, was stumped by another question Friday during
a conference call with reporters: How much of the $1 million will
he take home after taxes? ``Whatever the taxes are, I'll be happy
to pay them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, when asked whether he will continue in his job,
Carpenter admitted he is ``leaning towards doing something else.''
His plans for spending his bounty include nothing more grandiose
than renovating his house ``and of course going on a nice long
vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter is apparently a Red Sox fan. According to ABC
publicist Pat Preblick, he owns a dog named Fenway, and when asked
by ``Millionaire'' host Regis Philbin what he would do if he won,
Carpenter replied that he would buy the Red Sox a power pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, who graduated from Rutgers University with a degree
in economics, has few hobbies except for jogging and doing
crossword puzzles. Now that he is a millionaire, ``I might find
myself with time to play a little more,'' he remarked.
</P>
<P>
   During the program, which was taped Thursday and aired Friday
night, Carpenter was so confident he had the right answer to the
million-dollar question that he indulged in a little theater before
giving it. Under the rules of the show, contestants can use
``lifelines'' to call friends or family members at home for help.
Carpenter told reporters that he used a ``lifeline'' to call his
father, Tom, and tell him that he was about to win $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think I have a flair for the dramatic,'' said
Carpenter, whose wife, Debbie, was in the studio audience. He said
he took the other nine contestants out for a drink following his
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, as recently as August, Carpenter was ``sort of
against game shows.'' He said he ``never would have even considered
watching the show'' if some friends had not urged him to do so.
Once he started watching, he found that he ``knew almost all the
answers'' _ a not uncommon reaction among viewers of the show,
whose questions can be jaw-droppingly simple.
</P>
<P>
   Even after hitting the jackpot, Carpenter seemed nonplussed by
the media hubbub surrounding his victory. ``I really had no idea
there would be this kind of reaction, and it really strikes me as
kind of silly,'' said Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Carpenter's coup, $500,000 was the largest prize any
contestant had won on ``Millionaire.'' Earlier this month on Fox's
``Greed,'' a copycat quiz show rushed onto the air after
``Millionaire'' became a hit, three contestants split a prize of $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning ratings success of ``Millionaire'' has rewritten
the rules of prime time. The quiz-show genre, once relegated to
syndicated shows that air in the early evening, is now so hot that
CBS and NBC are scrambling to develop quiz shows to air early next
year. Host Philbin's query ``Is that your final answer?'' is on its
way to becoming one of television's memorable catch phrases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' barreled to instant hit status in August, but
some dismissed it as a fluke because it occurred during the summer
doldrums, when other networks air mostly reruns. But when ABC
brought the quiz show back for the November sweeps period _
benching numerous sitcoms to do so _ ``Millionaire'' was stronger
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The show has obliterated the competition each of the nights it
has aired this month, drawing more than 20 million viewers every
time and prompting ABC to add an extra three nights next week. Even
against NBC's powerhouse Thursday lineup, ``Millionaire'' proved
unstoppable, drawing 23 million viewers and defeating longtime
ratings heavyweight ``Frasier'' by 6 million viewers. ABC
representative Preblick said Friday that a total of 123 million
viewers have tuned in to ``Millionaire'' at some point this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' is modeled on a program that has been a big hit
in Britain for years, although no one has won the top prize there.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have ridiculed the easiness of many of the
multiple-choice questions thrown at contestants on ``Millionaire,''
whose chances of answering them are bolstered by being able to
solicit aid from the audience or from friends or family. ABC has
also come under some fire for the lack of diversity on the show:
Virtually all of the contestants thus far have been white males.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin will present Carpenter with his check for $1 million
Monday on ``Live with Regis and Kathie Lee,'' a syndicated show
that Philbin cohosts with Kathie Lee Gifford. That means that
affiliates of other networks that carry the show will be forced to
provide free publicity for an ABC show.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ A day after President Clinton and other
Western leaders confronted President Boris Yeltsin of Russia at a
meeting in Turkey, criticizing his actions in Chechnya, Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas went them one better, calling for an end to
international aid to Moscow unless the Russian government stops
``killing women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot excuse Russian brutality,'' Bush said Friday morning
in the first major foreign policy speech of his campaign for the
Republican presidential nomination. ``When the Russian government
attacks civilians, it can no longer expect aid from international
lending institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the Ronald Reagan Library in the dry hills outside
Simi Valley, a suburb 40 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles,
Bush walked a fine line, balancing tough talk with more moderate
formulations. But he made it clear at the outset that he would hew
to the internationalist principles of his father and fight those in
his own party as well as those outside it who have sought ``to
build a proud tower of protectionism and isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' he said, ``is the shortcut to chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   While the governor implicitly criticized those Republicans who
reject trade agreements with China and turn their backs on the
United Nations, he was more explicit in his criticism of Clinton,
accusing him without citing him by name of allowing the nation ``to
move from crisis to crisis like a cork in a current.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing Clinton's leadership unfavorably to his father, Bush
declared:
</P>
<P>
   ``Alliances are not just for crises, summoned into action when
the fire bell sounds. They are sustained by contact and trust. The
Gulf War coalition, for example, was raised on the foundation of a
president's vision and effort and integrity. Never again should an
American president spend nine days in China, and not even bother to
stop in Tokyo or Seoul or Manila. Never again should an American
president fall silent when China criticizes our security ties to
Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush delivered his 35-minute speech with considerable aplomb,
turning a well-versed, well-drilled performance that on several
occasions rose to presidential level. He quoted Burke and Pericles
and Alexander Solzhenitzyn, and he even echoed a bit of
Churchillian rhetoric when he promised a foreign policy built upon
``idealism, without illusions; confidence, without conceit;
realism, in the service of American ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy seldom plays a central part in American
presidential campaigns. But it can prove decisive if a candidate
gives the impression that the management of the nation's affairs
overseas is beyond his reach.
</P>
<P>
   That happened to Gov. George Romney of Michigan in 1968, when he
said he had been ``brainwashed'' by American officials in Saigon,
and some Bush backers had feared that he faced similar risks. He
had called the Greeks ``Grecians'' and failed to identify important
foreign leaders when given an in-your-face pop quiz by a Boston
television reporter.
</P>
<P>
   His confident performance Friday put such fears to rest for the
moment. But Bush will face a much tougher challenge in a series of
three debates with his Republican rivals, starting in New Hampshire
on Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   They will press him, no doubt, to say more specifically than he
did Friday about what he meant when he asserted that ``American
internationalism should not mean action without vision, activity
without priority, and missions without end _ an approach that
squanders American will and drains American energy.'' Bush argued
that ``unless a president sets his own priorities, his priorities
will be set by others _ by adversaries, or the crisis of the
moment, live on CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   Few would disagree with that. The problem is defining priorities
and criteria for action, which Bush made no real attempt to do. A
president, he said simply, should extend the peace, build a united
Western Hemisphere linked by free trade, seek Middle East peace,
check the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and do it with
``patience, wisdom and strength.''

 SIMI VALLEY, Calif.: and strength.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Blackwill, a lecturer at the John F. Kennedy School of
government at Harvard University, who worked on the National
Security Council in the Bush administration, said that the governor
had concentrated heavily Friday on Russia and China because those
nations, ``not Haiti, not Somalia,'' impinged directly upon the
national interests of the United States. In fact, Bush made no
mention at all of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwill is a member of a small group counseling Bush on
foreign policy matters. It also includes Condoleezza Rice of
Stanford University, Paul Wolfowitz of Johns Hopkins University,
Robert Zoellick of Harvard, the German Marshall Fund of the United
States and Goldman, Sachs, and Richard Perle of the American
Enterprise Institute. All have served in past Republican
administrations, and several were with Bush Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two of Eurasia's greatest powers, China and Russia, are powers
in transition, and it is difficult to know their intentions when
they do not know their own futures,'' Bush told a largely invited
audience of about 400 people here. ``If they become America's
friends, that friendship will steady the world. But if not, the
peace we seek may not be found.''
</P>
<P>
   Consistency was one of Bush's main themes, especially on China.
Again without naming Clinton, he said the administration had called
the Chinese leadership ``the butchers of Beijing'' one year and
embraced the Chinese leadership as a ``strategic partner'' only a
few years later.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the governor said, he would stand up to China if
it threatened democratic nations in its region, such as Taiwan and
South Korea. He promised again to help Taiwan defend itself. And he
welcomed the idea of Chinese entry into the World Trade
Organization, while warning that ``it will take a strong
administration to hold them to their word,'' given what he termed
``China's poor record'' in honoring international agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must deal with China without ill-will, but without
illusions,'' Bush said in one of his many this-and-that statements.
China ``will be unthreatened, but not unchecked,'' he added a few
moments later.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced as ``a person who thinks for himself'' by former
Secretary of State George Shultz, who is an unofficial member of
the Bush brain trust, Bush spoke in a yearlong forum series
sponsored by the Reagan Library. Former first lady Nancy Reagan was
in the audience, as she was when Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
Bush's leading Republican rival, spoke here in September.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had many reasons to choose the Reagan Library as the venue
for his speech. California has more delegates to the Republican
convention than any other state, and Reagan went directly from two
terms as governor to the presidency without any previous Washington
experience, just as Bush is attempting to do.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Rice said, Bush wanted to contrast Reagan with
Clinton, especially with regard to the Californian's ``strength,
leadership and choosing a few goals, a few regions and
concentrating our national resources on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush won his loudest applause when he took a tough, Reaganesque
line in defense of what he called ``America's interests, America's
obligations and America's honor,'' and when he obliquely criticized
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to develop and deploy both theater and national
missile defense systems, and he ripped into the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty that the Senate recently rejected. The treaty, he said,
``does not stop proliferation, especially by renegade regimes by a
wide margin. It is not verifiable. It is not enforceable. And it
would stop us from ensuring the safety and reliability of our
nation's deterrent, should the need arise.''
</P>
<P>
   On the United Nations, he was again even-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never place U.S. troops under U.N. command, but the
U.N. can help in peacekeeping and unitarian efforts,'' Bush
declared to warm applause at one point. ``If I am elected
president, America will pay its dues, but only if the U.N.'s
bureaucracy is reformed and our disproportionate share of its costs
is reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   There was even a slight bow to the French and their argument
that the American formula is not a one-size-fits-all model for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We value the elegant structures of our own democracy, ``the
governor said, ``but realize that, in other societies, the
architecture will vary. We propose our principles but we must not
impose our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush pre-sold his speech in telephone calls to columnists and
reporters in recent days, and his potential opponents, such as Vice
President Al Gore, had their aides calling to comment on it before
it had even been delivered. Clearly it was a big event in the
unfolding campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was put in a difficult position by Bush's call for an end
to international aid to Chechnya. Gore is closely associated with
the Russians, and he supported the administration when it held up
aid to Indonesia when its soldiers were killing people in East
Timor. It will be hard to argue that what the Russians are doing in
Chechnya is different.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing Republican criticism, the administration is reassessing
whether to announce a major resumption of American aid to Russia in
the next week or so, in the form of a half-billion dollars in loans
by the Export-Import Bank.

 &HT;    Making of `Kane' makes for intriguing tale
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Orson Welles is embalmed in Genius. At 25, he co-wrote, directed
and starred in ``Citizen Kane''; then he spent the rest of his life
trying vainly to repeat that accomplishment. His genius is credited
with making what many consider the greatest American movie ever.
And it's his genius that's accused of dooming him to a life that
topped out right about there. ``There, but for the grace of God,''
screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz once said of Welles, ``goes God.''
Clearly, this was a complicated man.
</P>
<P>
   ``All stars burn out, Orson,'' he's told by a Hollywood studio
head after the release of ``Citizen Kane'' in HBO's curiously
riveting ``RKO 281,'' based on a PBS documentary. ``It's the flame
that counts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``RKO 281'' _ the title refers to the studio sound stage where
the movie was shot _ stars Liev Schreiber (``A Walk on the Moon,''
``Scream 2'') as Welles, along with John Malkovich, James Cromwell,
Melanie Griffith and Roy Scheider.
</P>
<P>
   The film centers on the nature of Welles' flame as it burned
during the making of ``Kane.'' It's an eternal flame, but one with
an asterisk: It shines both for the great thing he did and for all
the great things he didn't do. By his mid-20s, Welles joked, not
all that jokingly, he was ``the youngest has-been'' in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Welles was Hollywood's boy wonder: a big, booming Baby Huey of a
presence whose legend included the tidbit that the first words out
of his infant mouth were ``I am a genius.'' He had made his early
reputation in theater and radio, where his 1938 direction of the
Martian invasion in H.G. Wells' ``The War of the Worlds'' played
across the country like a real-life alert (one critic calls the
fake verite broadcast a forerunner of ``The Blair Witch Project'').
</P>
<P>
   But it was exactly what made Welles so sought after _ the
dreaded ``g'' (as in genius) word _ that also made him so despised.
The idea for ``Kane'' came to him after he met William Randolph
Hearst, a ruthless, Rupert Murdoch-style publishing mogul of his
day. It is in the cold and sort of creepy Hearst that Welles sees a
vehicle to dramatize ``a modern feudal lord'' and ``a journey into
the heart of the beast.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an audacious undertaking, both artistically (some saw the
notion as ``elitist crap'') and practically _ as one of the
country's most powerful men, Hearst controlled Hollywood machinery
that destroyed people. ``RKO 281'' is these two stories on a
collision course.
</P>
<P>
   The movie mostly succeeds in telling both. Its behind-the-scenes
look at the making of ``Citizen Kane'' takes us behind the scenes
of much more: Welles' insecurity, Hollywood's spineless nastiness,
Hearst's monstrous position.
</P>
<P>
   Malkovich is typically brilliant as Mankiewicz, playing the
drunken, wasting-it-away talent with such easy, self-aware cynicism
that he's at once profound and profoundly pitiable. (``Listen to
me, you child,'' he tells Welles of Hearst. ``He has more power
than you can begin to imagine.'')
</P>
<P>
   Scheider, as RKO head George Schaefer, is the suit caught in the
middle, wanting to support Welles while fending off the
bean-counting suits above him. And Cromwell plays Hearst with such
perfect bloodlessness that even the hammy Griffith, as his
luscious, foul-mouthed mistress, seems right in her part. (``How
does one get $125 million in debt?'' she asks a crumbling Hearst,
who coolly replies, ``One buys things.'')
</P>
<P>
   Schrieber rarely stumbles as Welles. But that's not the problem.
He just doesn't have the outsize presence, as Welles did, that
would make his mere showing up be enough for us to believe in him.
</P>
<P>
   But that finally doesn't detract from the neat trick that this
HBO original movie, written by John Logan and directed by Benjamin
Ross, manages to pull off. It tells the story of one unforgettable
American tragedy (Welles) as he makes an American tragedy
(``Kane'') few will forget.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    That's the plan as another lander nears the Red Planet, hauling
a microphone to record _ for the first time _ sounds from our
neighbor in space
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 21.
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASA has Mars in its sights again, and officials are hoping next
week's long-awaited touchdown of the Mars Polar Lander will not be
a replay of the embarrassing glitches that turned the space
agency's last mission to the Red Planet into a total loss.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, NASA's three-legged, one-armed robot
lander will set down shortly after 3 p.m. Dec. 3, setting the stage
for a week of sights _ and sounds _ unlike anything since
spacecraft began visiting the fourth rock from the sun 34 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's 13th Mars mission has something for everyone, from
veteran planetary geologists who want to know what happened to
Mars' missing water, to the public, whose appetite for glimpses of
Mars led to 500 million hits on NASA's Web site during the 1997
landing of the Mars Pathfinder.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation is already building. The number of visitors to the
main Web site for the mission _ mars.jpl.nasa.gov _ has been
growing since midyear, with more than 8 million hits recorded last
month. Interest is especially keen this time because, along with
more complex experiments, the lander will carry a tiny microphone,
making it possible for the first time to hear sounds from the
surface of another planet.
</P>
<P>
   During the three months the lander will operate on the surface,
it is expected to give scientists and the public glimpses of a
martian landscape no one has seen before: the strange layered
terrain that borders the planet's southern polar icecap.
</P>
<P>
   The alternating light and dark bands, photographed at great
distance from orbiting satellites, are believed to contain
different mixtures of dust and ice. Like the growth rings of trees,
they may contain the record of seasonal changes in the martian
climate. And because the lander will be arriving in what, on Mars,
is late spring, scientists hope to see changes as the region warms
and the ice melts. Temperatures on landing day are expected to be a
nippy minus-10 to minus-70 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   The search for water on Mars looms large, not only in the
current mission but in the seven others NASA is planning over the
next decade. Vast canyons and flood-scoured gullies show that Mars,
now more arid than the driest desert on Earth, once had lots of
water. But that was 3 billion years ago. Finding out where the
water went is a key to understanding the radical climate shift that
occurred as Mars evolved.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid water is also one of the essential ingredients for life
as we know it. The hints of fossil microbes found in martian
meteorites suggest that about the time primitive life began on
Earth, it may have appeared on Mars too. Some scientists even
speculate that simple life might still be there, clinging to a
foothold somewhere underground where it's warmer, wetter and less
exposed to harsh solar radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Mars' south pole holds one of the keys to understanding its
climate. Unlike the north polar cap, which is 10 times larger and
composed primarily of water ice, the south polar ice is primarily
frozen carbon dioxide _ dry ice. In the winter, it doesn't snow.
The atmosphere simply freezes on the surface. But scientists
believe that the fringes of the polar cap, and the soil beneath it,
may contain water ice as well. By measuring constituents of Mars'
atmosphere as the region warms up and spring turns to summer, they
hope to get a better idea of the driving forces in Mars' climate.
</P>
<P>
   First, of course, the lander has to arrive safely. In light of
recent mishaps, that's more than a trifling concern for the $200
million mission. In 1993, NASA lost contact with its Mars Observer
en route to the planet. In 1997, another orbiter _ now circling
Mars _ encountered problems with its solar panels that have impeded
its mapping of the surface. In September, errors in NASA's mission
operations center sent a third Mars orbiter worth $125 million
crashing into the surface. Investigators have concluded that the
cause of the calamity was NASA engineers' failure to convert
English units of measurement into metric units _ followed by eight
subsequent failures to catch the mistake. Officials vow the errors
won't be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to doing whatever it takes to maximize the
prospects for a successful landing,'' says Edward Stone, director
of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the agency's
Mars missions.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the surface safely, the Mars lander, which was launched
from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in January, will have to
enter the martian atmosphere at a precise angle. With the
spacecraft moving at more than 15,000 miles per hour, an error of 1
degree either way could send it skipping off into space _ or into a
fiery plunge through the atmosphere that would destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   Because it will be out of radio contact with Earth throughout
the descent, the spacecraft will operate on pre-programmed
instructions during the final minutes before landing. A parachute
will open when it is about four miles above the surface. At about
one mile, the spacecraft will discard the parachute and fire its
engines to make a controlled soft landing.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific investigations will begin even before the
landing. As it nears Mars, the spacecraft will jettison two
basketball-size probes that will slam into the surface at more than
400 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   As the probes' outer shells shatter, they will release miniature
penetrating devices that will bury themselves up to six feet in the
martian soil _ where experts believe they may encounter the icy
residue of water that once coursed across the surface. For 50
hours, the microprobes will collect small amounts of soil and heat
it to see whether any water is released. Results will be sent to
Earth from a tiny radio station that will remain on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The lander will record pictures of Mars as it heads toward the
surface. Once it lands, it will deploy its solar panels, take
panoramic images of the landscape and get ready for business.
</P>
<P>
   The lander's robot arm _ a 6-foot-long device about as strong as
a human arm _ won't go into action until Dec. 6. It will start by
merely pawing a little trench in the surface, but over the next few
months it will dig up to 6 feet into the surrounding soil, scooping
heaps of the stuff into small ovens on the lander to be heated and
analyzed for water content and other constituents.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dramatic events, however, is likely to be one
that NASA didn't pay for. The Mars microphone, first proposed by
the late Carl Sagan and funded to the tune of $50,000 by the
Planetary Society, which he co-founded, will give earthlings their
first chance to hear what it sounds like on the surface of another
planet.

   ``The microphone will be able to hear winds, perhaps even a type
of lightning within sandstorms, and noises made by the lander, such
as the sound of the robotic arm digging for soil samples,'' says
Greg Delory, a University of California, Berkeley, engineer who
helped design the microphone. ``The most interesting sounds,
however, will be those we don't know about yet.''

<P>
   Alexander Liberman, the dominant creative force at Conde Nast
Publications for more than half a century and one of the most
influential and glamorous editors in America, died Friday at Mount
Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. He was 87 and had homes in New
York and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Russian-born Liberman considered himself first an
artist and second a magazine editor and designer, it was his
extraordinary career at Conde Nast, first as art director for Vogue
and later as editorial director for all the company's magazines,
that gave him his power and reach. From the time he arrived at
Vogue in 1941, having just fled occupied France, he brought a
modern sensibility to fashion journalism that would remain with him
through his life.
</P>
<P>
   His determination to replace the hauteur of Vogue with a sense
of freedom and informality helped change the way American women saw
themselves. He wanted to embolden design and to break away from
artifice, so he brought in younger photographers who shot outdoors
in natural light. ``No more Ophelias dancing through the Plaza at
dawn,'' he said. In time, as Amy Spindler, now the style editor of
The New York Times Magazine, observed, ``No man in the Western
world held more power over the fashion images men and women saw
than Liberman during his tenure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He responded so intuitively and so sensitively to changes of
every kind _ changes in social attitudes as well as changes in
photography and art and visual communication _ that he always
seemed to be one or two jumps ahead of everyone else in his field,
and because of this, the magazines he directed stayed fresh and
innovative and very much alive,'' Dodie Kazanjian and Calvin
Tomkins wrote in their 1993 biography, ``Alex.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Vogue, the magazines published by Conde Nast over
the years were Vanity Fair, Glamour, House &AMP; Garden (known for a
period as HG), Mademoiselle, Bride's, GQ, Self, Gourmet, Conde Nast
Traveler, Woman, Details, Allure, Architectural Digest and Bon
Appetit.
</P>
<P>
   An elegant, courtly man who always wore gray suits to the office
with pale blue shirts and narrow hand-knit navy silk ties, Liberman
inspired both adulation and terror among editors and art directors.
From 1960 to 1994, in his position as editorial director of all
Conde Nast magazines, he had the final word on virtually all
editorial matters from captions to covers.
</P>
<P>
   Some editors loved working with him, appreciating the sureness
of his judgment and the authority of his eye, as well as his
constant desire to experiment. Others _ wary of his famous icy
glance _ quaked as he tore up layouts and substituted covers at the
last minute. ``Dear friend,'' he would say, ``don't you think it
might be better this way?''
</P>
<P>
   Several editors and art directors learned to their dismay that
the price of disagreeing with the Silver Fox, as Liberman was known
within the company, could be dismissal from Conde Nast, although he
himself never did the firing and differences with him were rarely
stated as the reason for the dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   Liberman's remarkable tenure stemmed in great part from the
close personal and working relationships he established with the
succession of men who headed the company, starting with Conde Nast
himself. The closest of these relationships was with S.I. Newhouse
Jr., who started work in 1961 in the company acquired by his father
the previous decade and who was appointed chairman in 1975. In a
note to Liberman on his 80th birthday, Newhouse referred to their
relationship as ``the most meaningful experience of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberman was eventually recognized by many critics as a
significant painter. But even though his work came to be exhibited
by art dealers like Larry Gagosian, Betty Parsons and Andre
Emmerich, his reputation was always somewhat tainted by his
position at Conde Nast. Some critics found it difficult not to be
dismissive of an artist who was so prominent a figure in the world
of glitz and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Liberman was born in Kiev, Ukraine, on Sept. 4, 1912, to a
wealthy timber merchant and his wife, and lived a coddled,
luxurious life until the Russian Revolution erupted in 1917. Life
became so stressful that when Alex was 9 his father asked to take
the boy with him on a trade mission to London; the request was
taken up before the Politburo and received the approval of Lenin.
</P>
<P>
   The young Alex spent the next three years in London and attended
English boarding schools, where he learned good table manners,
self-discipline and the English language, all of which would serve
him well for the rest of his life. In 1924 he moved with his mother
to Paris, where he lived on and off for the next 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   He studied painting and architecture at the Ecole des Beaux Arts
and began his journalistic career at Vu, a photographic newsweekly
and prototype of Life magazine. It was owned by Lucien Vogel, who
would one day introduce him to Conde Nast. In 1936 he married
Hildegarde Sturm, a German model and skiing champion. A year later
she walked out on him and they were eventually divorced.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938 Liberman was reintroduced to Tatiana Iacovleva du
Plessix, a blond Russian emigre he had known when he was younger.
The two soon became lovers. Two years later her husband, Count
Bertrand du Plessix, an early Resistance hero in World War II, was
killed when his plane was shot down. A beautiful and imperious
woman who had once been engaged to the Russian poet Vladimir
Mayakovsky, she had survived starvation when she was a girl by
reciting Pushkin to Bolshevik soldiers in return for potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing the Nazis, Liberman, Tatiana and her 10-year-old
daughter, Francine, escaped through Spain and Portugal and sailed
to New York in 1941. Through Vogel, then a consultant at Conde
Nast, Liberman went to work in the art department of Vogue. It was
the start of a legendary career that brought Liberman not only
recognition and wealth but also enabled him to marry Tatiana, who
became a hat designer for Henri Bendel and then for Saks Fifth
Avenue, as Tatiana of Saks.
</P>
<P>
   The critics were far more receptive to Liberman's sculpture than
his painting. His sculptures, fashioned from gas storage tanks and
old boilers, appear in parks, shopping malls and college campuses
throughout this country and abroad, making him one of the most
prolific public sculptors of his time. Robert Hughes, art critic at
Time and a Vogue contributor, called the welded-steel sculptures
Liberman's most important work, describing them as ``of real
importance in recent American sculpture.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberman was also a serious photographer. In the 1940s and '50s,
he photographed Braque, Matisse, Utrillo, Rouault, Brancusi,
Chagall and Picasso, among others, for a book of photo essays,
``The Artist in His Studio.'' He was also the author of ``Greece,
Gods and Art''; ``Marlene: An Intimate Photographic Memoir,'' about
Marlene Dietrich; ``Campidoglio,'' a book of photographs taken over
20 years showing the Roman capitol designed by Michelangelo; and
``Then: 1925-1995,'' a retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 his wife, Tatiana, died. The next year he married
Melinda Pechangco, the nurse who had attended Tatiana in her last
illness. In addition to his wife and stepdaughter, of Warren,
Conn., Liberman is survived by two stepgrandchildren.

 &HT;    That's the plan as another lander nears the Red Planet, hauling
a microphone to record _ for the first time _ sounds from our
neighbor in space
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 21.
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASA has Mars in its sights again, and officials are hoping next
week's long-awaited touchdown of the Mars Polar Lander will not be
a replay of the embarrassing glitches that turned the space
agency's last mission to the Red Planet into a total loss.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, NASA's three-legged, one-armed robot
lander will set down shortly after 3 p.m. Dec. 3, setting the stage
for a week of sights _ and sounds _ unlike anything since
spacecraft began visiting the fourth rock from the sun 34 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's 13th Mars mission has something for everyone, from
veteran planetary geologists who want to know what happened to
Mars' missing water, to the public, whose appetite for glimpses of
Mars led to 500 million hits on NASA's Web site during the 1997
landing of the Mars Pathfinder.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation is already building. The number of visitors to the
main Web site for the mission _ mars.jpl.nasa.gov _ has been
growing since midyear, with more than 8 million hits recorded last
month. Interest is especially keen this time because, along with
more complex experiments, the lander will carry a tiny microphone,
making it possible for the first time to hear sounds from the
surface of another planet.
</P>
<P>
   During the three months the lander will operate on the surface,
it is expected to give scientists and the public glimpses of a
martian landscape no one has seen before: the strange layered
terrain that borders the planet's southern polar icecap.
</P>
<P>
   The alternating light and dark bands, photographed at great
distance from orbiting satellites, are believed to contain
different mixtures of dust and ice. Like the growth rings of trees,
they may contain the record of seasonal changes in the martian
climate. And because the lander will be arriving in what, on Mars,
is late spring, scientists hope to see changes as the region warms
and the ice melts. Temperatures on landing day are expected to be a
nippy minus-10 to minus-70 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   The search for water on Mars looms large, not only in the
current mission but in the seven others NASA is planning over the
next decade. Vast canyons and flood-scoured gullies show that Mars,
now more arid than the driest desert on Earth, once had lots of
water. But that was 3 billion years ago. Finding out where the
water went is a key to understanding the radical climate shift that
occurred as Mars evolved.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid water is also one of the essential ingredients for life
as we know it. The hints of fossil microbes found in martian
meteorites suggest that about the time primitive life began on
Earth, it may have appeared on Mars too. Some scientists even
speculate that simple life might still be there, clinging to a
foothold somewhere underground where it's warmer, wetter and less
exposed to harsh solar radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Mars' south pole holds one of the keys to understanding its
climate. Unlike the north polar cap, which is 10 times larger and
composed primarily of water ice, the south polar ice is primarily
frozen carbon dioxide _ dry ice. In the winter, it doesn't snow.
The atmosphere simply freezes on the surface. But scientists
believe that the fringes of the polar cap, and the soil beneath it,
may contain water ice as well. By measuring constituents of Mars'
atmosphere as the region warms up and spring turns to summer, they
hope to get a better idea of the driving forces in Mars' climate.
</P>
<P>
   First, of course, the lander has to arrive safely. In light of
recent mishaps, that's more than a trifling concern for the $200
million mission. In 1993, NASA lost contact with its Mars Observer
en route to the planet. In 1997, another orbiter _ now circling
Mars _ encountered problems with its solar panels that have impeded
its mapping of the surface. In September, errors in NASA's mission
operations center sent a third Mars orbiter worth $125 million
crashing into the surface. Investigators have concluded that the
cause of the calamity was NASA engineers' failure to convert
English units of measurement into metric units _ followed by eight
subsequent failures to catch the mistake. Officials vow the errors
won't be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to doing whatever it takes to maximize the
prospects for a successful landing,'' says Edward Stone, director
of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the agency's
Mars missions.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the surface safely, the Mars lander, which was launched
from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in January, will have to
enter the martian atmosphere at a precise angle. With the
spacecraft moving at more than 15,000 miles per hour, an error of 1
degree either way could send it skipping off into space _ or into a
fiery plunge through the atmosphere that would destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   Because it will be out of radio contact with Earth throughout
the descent, the spacecraft will operate on pre-programmed
instructions during the final minutes before landing. A parachutewill open when it is about four miles above the surface. At about
one mile, the spacecraft will discard the parachute and fire its
engines to make a controlled soft landing.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific investigations will begin even before the
landing. As it nears Mars, the spacecraft will jettison two
basketball-size probes that will slam into the surface at more than
400 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   As the probes' outer shells shatter, they will release miniature
penetrating devices that will bury themselves up to six feet in the
martian soil _ where experts believe they may encounter the icy
residue of water that once coursed across the surface. For 50
hours, the microprobes will collect small amounts of soil and heat
it to see whether any water is released. Results will be sent to
Earth from a tiny radio station that will remain on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The lander will record pictures of Mars as it heads toward the
surface. Once it lands, it will deploy its solar panels, take
panoramic images of the landscape and get ready for business.
</P>
<P>
   The lander's robot arm _ a 6-foot-long device about as strong as
a human arm _ won't go into action until Dec. 6. It will start by
merely pawing a little trench in the surface, but over the next few
months it will dig up to 6 feet into the surrounding soil, scooping
heaps of the stuff into small ovens on the lander to be heated and
analyzed for water content and other constituents.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dramatic events, however, is likely to be one
that NASA didn't pay for. The Mars microphone, first proposed by
the late Carl Sagan and funded to the tune of $50,000 by the
Planetary Society, which he co-founded, will give earthlings their
first chance to hear what it sounds like on the surface of another
planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The microphone will be able to hear winds, perhaps even a type
of lightning within sandstorms, and noises made by the lander, such
as the sound of the robotic arm digging for soil samples,'' says
Greg Delory, a University of California, Berkeley, engineer who
helped design the microphone. ``The most interesting sounds,
however, will be those we don't know about yet.''

 &HT;    Zoo Atlanta expects pandemonium this weekend
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Zoo Atlanta's panda exhibit opens to the public this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   But take a breath. If you plan to see Yang Yang and Lun Lun soon
soon, you'll need more patience than the pandas do bamboo. And
that's a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Lines at the ticket counters are sure to be long when the zoo
opens this morning at 9:30 (9 for zoo members). Police and zoo
staffers will be on hand to keep the obnoxious from breaking into
line.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the number of telephone calls she's received, marketing
director Gail Eaton expects lots of people to show up well before
the gates open _ and as many as 15,000 by the time they close at
4:30 p.m. That's five times normal attendance for a late-fall
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   No tickets will be sold in advance. Ticket buyers will receive a
stub giving them a time to take a five-minute tour of the panda
habitat. The stubs are first-come, first-served, and zoo officials
estimate that up to half the people who show up today won't get
one. Those who do get panda appointments will be hustled through in
groups of 30 to 35.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton asks that Atlantans remember that the bears _ and yes,
they are bears, not raccoons _ will be in the city for at least 10
years, and probably for the rest of their lives. The best time to
see them won't be this weekend, or even next weekend. It would be
best to go on a weekday, just after lunchtime, when school groups
have headed back to their desks.
</P>
<P>
   For those who do go today, Eaton cautions, traffic will be
tough. The zoo has only about 900 parking spaces at Grant Park.
Other marked parking spots will be available on Cherokee Avenue and
Boulevard, but Atlanta police will be out in force making sure
zoogoers don't park illegally in the neighborhood. Tow trucks will
be at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton recommends driving to Turner Field, a mile west of the
zoo. The zoo will run shuttles from there today and Sunday, and
next weekend as well. Another option: MARTA plans to run buses from
the West End station every 20 minutes instead of every 40.

HIGH NUMBER GOALS ARE SHELVED IN POLICING IRS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bowing Friday night to sharp criticism from his own
investigators, a Treasury Department official withdrew the goals he
had set under which the number of Internal Revenue Service workers
to be investigated for misconduct next year would nearly equal the
number of Americans who will be investigated for criminal tax
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   David C. Williams, the Treasury inspector general for tax
administration, sent an e-mail to his 475 special agents saying
that they would be evaluated on providing ``timely and
comprehensive investigating services'' and not on how many cases
were opened against the 98,000 IRS employees.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Williams went further, saying his new policy
rescinds the e-mail he sent earlier setting a goal of 440 cases
each in his agency's Atlanta, Dallas and New York offices and
smaller goals for seven other offices.
</P>
<P>
   In that e-mail, he wrote, ``to reach your divisional goal is the
responsibility of the special agent in charge,'' and those managing
agents ``will need to use the resources effectively to obtain the
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The goals were seen by many on his own staff and by many IRS
workers as quotas, but Williams insisted that they were only an
effort to plan for how to handle the expected workload.
</P>
<P>
   Among his own investigators, these goals stirred concern that
they would be forced to search for far more misdeeds than might
exist, waste their time on trivia and be pressed to trump up cases.
Nine of his investigators, who insisted that they not be
identified, said they were told to keep pursuing cases even after
concluding that the cases lacked merit.
</P>
<P>
   Under the goal for the next fiscal year, one in 28 IRS workers
was to be investigated, a far higher rate than at the Agriculture
Department and the Health and Human Services Department, where
inspectors general open cases on about one worker in 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving the goal would have meant that about 3,400 IRS workers
would be investigated next year. The service investigated 3,718
Americans for criminal tax fraud in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   IRS workers complained that instead of conducting audits and
collecting overdue taxes, they were busy defending themselves from
often false accusations made by taxpayers trying to thwart their
enforcement efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Williams acknowledged that most of
the cases investigated so far lacked merit and that many resulted
from complaints by people whose real goal was to interfere with the
administration of the tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   Williams met Thursday night with the president of the National
Treasury Employees Union, Colleen M. Kelley, who said she told him
``there should not be artificial numbers for investigations to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Williams assured her that he was ``acutely aware of the
damage that a perception of quotas can do throughout the IRS
workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   While special agents will be expected to investigate only as
many complaints as their offices receive, Williams said that his
total estimate of the cases to be investigated, including those of
non-IRS employees, like individuals impersonating tax collectors,
was still 4,000 for this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   He said a new directive would be issued next week detailing the
performance indicators that would be used to evaluate special
agents and their supervisors. He said those indicators would all
focus on the quality of investigations, not the quantity.
</P>
<P>
   Congress created the inspector general's office last year
because of complaints that an internal affairs unit at the IRS was
letting too many misconduct cases languish.

STOCK OPTION BONANZAS VS. STAGNANT PAYCHECKS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a story in search of an ending. The unemployment rate
has fallen as steadily as a barometer announcing a storm. Employers
struggle to find workers. The Federal Reserve raises interest rates
in anticipation of inflationary pressures from higher labor costs.
But those costs don't show up in the standard statistics. Yet they
must be out there, so the search is on.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed itself is a prominent sleuth, and its latest lead is
stock options. This popular form of pay for the higher end of the
work force is not recorded in the government's tallies of an
employer's labor costs, now dominated by wages and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   If they were added, then, voila, labor costs would suddenly
accelerate, and the story would have a familiar ending: tight labor
markets do indeed force up corporate labor costs, and then
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our calculations suggest that in recent years, stock options
have been a not-insignificant part of actual overall compensation
growth,'' four economists at the Federal Reserve concluded in a
recent study.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. The Labor Department is skeptical of the Fed's study,
which is based on an analysis of the practices of 125 companies,
plus some heroic projections about the rest of America's public
companies. Still, the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics is
sleuthing in the same direction, preparing a survey ``to find out
if options are as prevalent as some people say they are,'' said
John Ruser, a bureau economist.
</P>
<P>
   All this focus on options as the proper ending reflects a
reluctance to embrace an alternative story line: that labor costs
are not really rising. Even in these flush times, most workers are
accepting modest raises because they are beaten down by global
competition, job insecurity, temps, weak unions and corporate
migration to lower-wage regions.
</P>
<P>
   If this alternative story line is true, and a rising economy
will not lift pay by enough for enough workers, the only hope for
jacking up incomes may be government intervention, an idea out of
favor among both Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The market alone must set labor compensation, most politicians
and mainstream economists insist; even the minimum wage should not
be restored by Congress to its old buying power. And if the market
raises income through stock options, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   But America changes. Workers earning less than $10 an hour make
up almost two-fifths of the work force, and they rarely get stock
options. More than in the past, they are left out of a rising
economy, a blow to equality. Only 6.7 percent of the
lower-occupation workers in the Fed study got stock options,
compared with 32.8 percent at the upper end.
</P>
<P>
   These lucky ones present a different problem. Their options make
them rich, or they feel rich, but only as long as stock prices stay
up. When a falling market shrinks their wealth, they pull back on
spending faster than they might have if their pay had been in cash,
and they had saved some of the cash.
</P>
<P>
   Their quick retreat multiplies the blow to the economy from
falling stock prices. They also rush to exercise options and sell
stock, exacerbating the market decline.
</P>
<P>
   The government has two measures of labor costs. The most
popular, the Employment Cost Index, calculates what companies pay
out in wages, salaries and benefits. It does not capture stock
options or tips or bonuses paid to recruit people or keep them _
all growing categories.
</P>
<P>
   The second measure, much broader but rarely publicized, is
compensation per hour, which includes the tips and bonuses, and
even stock options when they are exercised _ but not the value of
unexercised option grants.
</P>
<P>
   Rough estimates put the value of those option grants at $60
billion to more than $100 billion last year. Options, therefore,
``ought to be considered as compensation on issue date,'' the Fed
study said.
</P>
<P>
   If they were, then the rise in the Employment Cost Index _
currently recorded as 3.1 percent to 3.5 percent a year since 1996
_ may turn out to have been understated by 0.3 percent each year,
according to the study. ``There is an understatement,'' said Ken
Matheny, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, ``but given the
sketchy data available, it is hard to know how much cost is really
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Say a company with a $10 stock grants options to employees,
giving them the right over several years to buy the stock from the
company at that price. If the market price rises to $15, an
employee can exercise the options and sell the newly purchased
stock at a $5-a-share profit. Whether the company satisfies the
options by issuing new shares or by buying existing ones in the
market at $15 apiece, a cost is incurred.
</P>
<P>
   It won't show up as a cost on the books, because American
accounting practices grant special treatment for stock options. And
perhaps the cost is not so much: perhaps the company bought some
shares for $10 when the options were granted and set them aside
against the day they would be exercised.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the options will expire unexercised because the stock
price has dropped below $10 in a falling market, and won't wind up
costing the company a thing.
</P>
<P>
   Options, in sum, are not the inexorable labor cost that a weekly
payroll represents. So the search must continue for a better
ending. Perhaps a boom economy just doesn't lift enough boats any
more, and that is the simple and unfortunate reason that labor
costs are not rising all that much.

<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: AGRI-BIZ
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected, 27-71, an amendment to impose
a moratorium on mergers and aquisitions between food and
agricululture companies. Supporters said the amendment, attached to
a bankruptcy reform bill, addresses the problem of market
concentration in the agricultural sector that is edging out family
farmers. Opponents said the bill overly restricts large
agribusiness companies. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: COAL
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 56 to 33, an amendment to allow
mountain coal mining operations to continue dumping waste into
rivers and streams for two more years. Supporters said the measure,
attached to a spending bill, would help mining companies. Opponents
said the measure would undermine existing environmental
protections. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.

and provides funds for the U.S. to repay debts to the United
Nations. The consolidated spending bill also gives $435.8 million
to the District of Columbia, and includes a plan to allow satellite
companies to provide local broadcast service to customers.
Supporters said the bill gives more money to key programs without
dipping into the Social Security surplus. Opponents said the $385
billion represents bad budgeting practices by including too many
last-minute provisions. They were also concerned that most members
did not have time to read the 2000-page document before voting. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.

NYC PLANS TO START ARRESTING HOMELESS WHO REFUSE SHELTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani declared Friday that the
homeless had no right to sleep on the streets, and Police
Commissioner Howard Safir said they would be arrested if they
refused shelter. Their remarks occurred three days after an office
worker in midtown Manhattan was critically injured in a random
attack by a man who police say may have been homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Streets do not exist in civilized societies for the purpose of
people sleeping there,'' said Giuliani during his weekly radio
call-in show. ``Bedrooms are for sleeping.'' He added that the
right to sleep on the streets ``doesn't exist anywhere. The
Founding Fathers never put that in the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   In a later telephone interview, Safir said that if people
sleeping on the sidewalks refused help from police and then ``don't
obey, we're going to arrest them.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir said police would visit the homeless encampments in their
precincts ``more often'' than before, but he would not specify the
frequency, saying it was up to the ``discretion of the police and
the commander.'' Safir said the homeless would first be offered
services. If they refused, he said, ``we will either summons them
or arrest them. If they're blocking people's access to property,
we'll move them along.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the homeless, who are fighting the city's plan to
require that the homeless work as a condition of shelter, reacted
with disbelief. ``Now the new plan being introduced by Mr. Safir
is, `We're not going to take you to Bellevue, we're going to take
you to Riker's Island?' '' said Mary Brosnahan, the executive
director of the Coalition for the Homeless, referring to a city
hospital and jail.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, the director of the New York Civil Liberties
Union, said the mayor ``legally has no basis'' for declaring that
the homeless have no right to sleep in the streets. ``It's not a
crime to sit or sleep on a public street, providing that you're not
blocking the entrances or exits to buildings, and that you're not
blocking pedestrian traffic,'' Siegel said. He added that ``the
issue cannot be living on the streets or locked up in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Renewed attention has been focused on the homeless and the
violently mentally ill since Tuesday, when Nicole Barrett, who was
crossing Madison Avenue at 42nd Street, was struck from behind for
no apparent reason by a man wielding a brick. Police have yet to
find the attacker, and do not know whether he is homeless or
mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   But the public and media outcry over the attack have fueled
concerns that people who are dangerously unstable are wandering the
streets, and the random nature of the assault reminds New Yorkers
of the schizophrenic who pushed a woman into the path of a subway
last January.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of the attack on Ms. Barrett, Giuliani said Friday on his radio
show that ``the presumption is that this was done by a mentally ill
person.'' He added that ``you're going to have a lot of fear,
you're going to have a lot of reaction, and you're going to have a
lot of over-reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir said the police would probably not be stepping up efforts
to roust the homeless from the streets had the brick attack not
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   And the mayor, during his radio show, referred several times to
Friday's front-page headline in the Daily News. The large headline,
``Get the Violent Crazies Off Our Streets,'' asked readers to turn
to an inside editorial with another big e headline, ``Hospitalize
the Deranged.'' The headline harkens back to the early 1990s, when
the News implored Mayor David Dinkins in a front-page headline ``Do
Something, Dave'' to stop the seemingly daily random violence when
the city's murder rate had reached an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who is a likely candidate for the U.S. Senate against
Hillary Rodham Clinton, has taken credit for the dramatic drop in
crime over the last several years. He is broadcasting television
commercials upstate that stress his achievements, including the
reduction in crime that he considers a cornerstone of his
administration. Although Giuliani said on his radio call-in show
that he did not agree with the Daily News headlines, he said he did
agree with the substance of the editorial, which said that while
not all mentally ill people on the streets are dangerous, ``a few
of them are murderous.'' The editorial urged the city to ``get them
off the street. Now.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the police began rounding up the homeless in a series
of Manhattan sweeps in the mid-1990s, most homeless were either
moved out of popular tourist areas and went to Brooklyn and Queens
_ or were issued summonses for such public nuisance violations as
impeding the flow of pedestrian traffic. Police officials said
Friday that the homeless could be arrested on charges of disorderly
conduct, trespassing or curfew violations.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the homeless said Friday that Safir's announcement
would be the first time that the city has threatened the homeless
with arrest as a broad policy. Police officials countered that it
was simply a ``re-emphasizing'' of existing policy.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster the police argument, police spokeswoman Marilyn Mode
said that in 1998 the department responded to 64,424 complaints
about people who were described as emotionally disturbed, of which
24,787 were removed to a hospital and 551 were arrested. ``This is
re-emphasizing basically what we've been doing all along,'' she
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the homeless said Friday that the city's
statements were bizarre in the wake of the Giuliani
administration's announcement last month that the homeless will
have to work to get shelter _ one of a list of rules that those who
want to keep their beds will have to obey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the logic here?'' said Ms. Brosnahan. ``We're going to
round them up and bring them to a shelter, and if they refuse work,
they're going to be thrown back on the streets?''
</P>
<P>
   As the cold weather brings a seasonal surge in applicants for
shelter, the city's shelter system is already short of regular bed
assignments for people seeking shelter for the first time,
according to Patrick Markee, a policy analyst for the Coalition for
the Homeless who monitors the shelters under a court decree. On an
average night last month, there were 7,198 single adults in the
city's shelters systems.
</P>
<P>
   The night before the mayor's announcement of a crackdown, Markee
said, 34 men applying for shelter for the first time at the 30th
Street Shelter intake center near Bellevue Hospital Center in
Manhattan waited into the night on chairs, and finally were bused
to one-night bed assignments in a shelter in East New York,
Brooklyn. Awakened at dawn, they were handed tokens and told to go
back to the intake center to begin the process anew.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, hundreds of men were stuck for weeks at a time on
this overnight circuit because of a shortage of what the city calls
``assessment beds,'' used to sort the homeless into more
specialized shelter programs, like those for the mentally ill, run
by private-nonprofit agencies under contract to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brosnahan and other homeless advocates said Friday that the
number of homeless has increased on the streets in the last 18
months as shelters have become full and more bureaucratic about who
they admit. She also said that Giuliani has not provided enough
money for homeless housing. ``It's not that these people have a
right to freeze to death on the streets,'' she said. ``It's that
they don't have enough housing.'' She said the mayor ``has now
painted himself into this increasingly reactionary corner.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani believes that the public's attitudes toward the
homeless have been misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times in which we romanticized this to such an
extent that we invited people to do it,'' Giuliani said Friday,
``and we created so-called penumbral rights and other things which
in fact led people further toward their own degradation rather than
moving them in a direction of making progress in their lives.''

TRADE PACTS MUST SAFEGUARD WORKERS, UNION CHIEF SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Raising the stakes in labor's dispute with
President Clinton over trade, the AFL-CIO's president, John
Sweeney, called on the administration Friday to scuttle a worldwide
round of trade-liberalization talks unless negotiators first take
steps toward protecting workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, already angry about last week's trade agreement with
China, said American labor unions want Clinton to persuade trade
ministers gathering in Seattle on Nov. 30 to allow trade sanctions
against countries that violate basic labor standards, like the ban
on child labor.
</P>
<P>
   The labor movements in the United States and in other
industrialized countries are taking a much more aggressive approach
toward the Seattle trade talks than toward previous rounds of
negotiations, insisting that workers' rights be included in any new
trade agreements. In past rounds of trade talks, corporations and
developing nations prevailed with their arguments that worker
rights have no place in trade accords.
</P>
<P>
   In what was billed as a major address to the National Press Club
here, Sweeney rejected accusations that labor's attacks on the
World Trade Organization and the China deal stemmed from
protectionism and isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate isn't about free trade or protection, engagement or
isolation,'' he said. ``The real debate is not over whether to be
part of the global economy, but over what are the rules for that
economy and who makes them _ not whether to engage China, but what
are the terms of that engagement, and whose values are to be
represented.''
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders view the Seattle trade meeting as a landmark
opportunity to establish for the first time a worldwide system of
enforceable labor rights. Labor officials say these rights would
enable workers, and not just corporations, to enjoy the fruits of
expanded trade.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said it was time to ensure that any future trade
agreements take into account not just corporate concerns, but also
the concerns of workers, environmentalists and human rights
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said he was pleased that Clinton had backed labor's call
to have the trade organization ministers set up a committee that
would draft rules on core labor standards. But with developing
countries vowing to block such a move, union leaders fear that
Clinton will drop his commitment to labor rights, rather than block
the planned round of worldwide trade talks from moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the WTO addresses these important issues, there will be
no support for a major new round of trade negotiations,'' Sweeney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some labor leaders are warning that if Clinton leaves the
Seattle talks without winning an international pledge to create a
system of worker rights, he will further antagonize union members
who are already fuming about his deal to let China join the WTO.
Union leaders are angry that the administration agreed to China's
membership in the trade organization without getting China to agree
to allow independent trade unions and to free imprisoned labor
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, the president's economic adviser, said, ``There's
no question that Bill Clinton is the single head of state fighting
hardest for and leading the effort for a working group on labor. We
will continue to make an all-out effort to achieve that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The anger at the administration, union leaders say, might not
only soften labor's support for Vice President Al Gore in his
campaign for the presidency, but might cause a diversion of union
money and manpower from Gore's race to a fight against the China
trade accord and the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO is working with environmental, consumer and human
rights groups to sponsor a large rally in Seattle to protest what
they see as the trade organization's pro-corporate tilt and its
frequent overruling of countries' environmental and consumer
protection laws.
</P>
<P>
   The trade organization's meeting, scheduled to run from Nov. 30
to Dec. 2 and bring together ministers from 135 countries, aims to
set ground rules for a multiyear round of trade talks that would
liberalize trade in agriculture, financial services, Internet
services and other areas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As an example of how labor values might be included in trade
rules, Sweeney argued that WTO rules should allow China's trading
partners to seek sanctions against China for using forced labor and
barring trade unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a country where anyone attempting to organize a union
is immediately arrested and imprisoned _ no exceptions,'' Sweeney
said of China.
</P>
<P>
   Developing countries are seeking to block the trade organization
from creating enforceable core labor standards and even from taking
the preliminary step of setting up a working group on labor rights.
Such core labor standards, union officials say, would include a ban
on child labor and on forced labor, and a right to form trade
unions and engage in collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Third-world countries fear that allowing their trading partners
to seek sanctions for violations of such labor standards would pave
the way to banning their exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``These countries say that we'll just slap restrictions on their
exports and make them poorer,'' said Jeffrey Schott, senior fellow
at the Institute for International Economics.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
expressed alarm at Sweeney's call on Clinton to block the new trade
round unless worker protections are included. Donohue has backed
creating a working group on labor.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that the new trade agreements will increase American
exports and jobs, Donohue said, ``I think John Sweeney and other
labor leaders are smart enough to recognize that to scuttle this
trade round and the China-WTO deal would not be in the interests of
this country, its workers, its economy or its national security.
This is a watershed opportunity to bring China into the
international trading system and to get it to adhere to the
international law.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney's speech made clear that he would rely on an alliance
with environmental, consumer and human rights groups to pressure
the WTO. ``We will continue to organize in the Congress against any
trade accords that do not include workers' rights and environmental
protections,'' he said.

TUMULT GREETS PRESIDENT'S VISIT TO GREECE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ President Clinton raised a glass to
American-Greek relations Friday night in the dignified confines of
Presidential Mansion as thousands of demonstrators clashed with
riot-equipped policemen in an ugly but contained protest against
the president's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting ``Clinton is a fascist,'' and ``The streets of Athens
belong to us,'' protesters threw stones and gasoline bombs, looted
stores and set fires in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Some tried to break through tight police lines in Constitution
Square but were repelled by the police, who fired tear gas
canisters. The demonstration was organized by Greece's small,
hard-line Communist Party to protest U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who arrived from Turkey for an abbreviated state visit,
never saw a single demonstrator. The Greek authorities permitted
protests in a confined area miles from his route. Only a small
group of well-wishers greeted Clinton at Ellenikon International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton mentioned the demonstrations obliquely in his toast
to President Konstandinos Stephanopoulos and other leaders, and he
also referred to the strains that have existed between the two
countries, which are longtime allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in all friendships, we have not always agreed, but we have
never broken ranks, because of our shared devotion to democracy and
freedom,'' Clinton said. ``If some engage us in passionate debate,
it is well to remember how hard both our countries have fought for
their right to do just that. I am honored to be in Greece
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the protesters, many of them young people who
identified themselves as Communists and anarchists, waved banners
denouncing Clinton and the United States and staged a chaotic
melee. The authorities estimated the number of protesters at more
than 5,000 and said more than a dozen arrests had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declared himself unfazed. Before arriving, he told
reporters: ``Greece is the world's oldest democracy. If people want
to protest, they ought to have a chance to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton visit taps into two traits deeply embedded in the
Greek psyche: leftist anti-Americanism and esteem for the right to
demonstrate, one of the rights suppressed during the rule of a
military junta in Greece from 1967 to 1974. The hostility to
Washington was based on its support for the dictatorship and
rekindled by the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that a lot of people in Greece disagree with my
position on Kosovo,'' Clinton said, ``and they have a right to
their opinion and I have a right to mine. I believe I was right,
and I think that the facts have proved that I was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Another national obsession _ enmity toward Turkey _ also colored
Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   The president arrived from Istanbul, Turkey, having brokered a
deal for a Caspian oil pipeline to Turkey that would bypass Russia
and Iran, but having failed to persuade Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit to make a good-will gesture toward Greece.
</P>
<P>
   That outcome seemed to bolster the conviction of many Greeks
that the United States, pursuing its own geopolitical interests,
unfairly favors Turkey at the expense of Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be good for both Turkey and Greece to coexist more
peacefully,'' said Yannis Baskozos, 30, an Athens shopkeeper.
``We'd save a lot of money on defense spending, and tourism would
flourish. But I don't think Clinton will help.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The White House had put better relations between Turkey and
Greece and a negotiated solution for the divided island of Cyprus
among the goals for the trip. Behind the scenes, some U.S.
officials were exasperated by their Greek counterparts.

<P>
   The United States has long lobbied the Greek government to crack
down harder on leftist terrorist groups, particularly one called
November 17, a shadowy anarchist movement that has killed five
Americans in the last 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials hoped to make the signing of an
agreement to cooperate against terrorism a centerpiece of the
visit. But Greece decided to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only agree to cooperate on terrorism if you are serious
about doing something about terrorism,'' said a former senior U.S.
intelligence official critical of the Greek decision. ``Pursuit and
trial of terrorists could be politically embarrassing to the
government of Greece.''
</P>
<P>
   Greek officials explained that any suggestion that the
government was caving in to U.S. demands would be politically
embarrassing. Many Greeks complain that the United States is
hypocritical on the issue and deeply resent any sign of
arm-twisting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of dignity,'' a Greek official said. ``The
timing of the Clinton visit makes it difficult. People will accuse
the government of always doing what the Americans tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationalists in Parliament have asserted that the treaty would
oblige Greece to give Washington intelligence data that could then
be relayed to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister George Papandreou said the reason the agreement
would not be signed on Saturday was because it was not finished and
ready. ``We will sign it sooner or later,'' he said, ``not just
now.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ It's one thing for a region to produce geopolitical
tensions, civil war, colorful freebooters and outrageous hyperbole.
It's quite another to generate a James Bond thriller.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the Caspian Sea first slipped into the discourse
of oil executives and policy wonks, the latest Bond installment,
``The World Is Not Enough,'' in which villains try to wrest control
of oil in Azerbaijan, is opening in the United States. The region,
in short, has come of age _ though whether it ever becomes the
bonanza many have predicted remains in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every country that's important gets its James Bond movie,''
said Laurent Ruseckas, who is writing a Ph.D dissertation at
Columbia University on the pursuit of Caspian oil. ``It has great
history, oil, the new great game, plus big players _ Russians,
Turks, Americans. It adds a touch of excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   By odd coincidence, the movie opened a day after the latest
episode in the Caspian drama, a breakthrough agreement among the
countries of the region witnessed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Caspian affair centers on a Clinton administration goal
not unlike that of the Bond villains _ to detach the region and its
oil from Russian domination.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton reveled over how one of his key foreign
policy aims _ the construction of a pipeline for Caspian oil
independent of Iran and Russia _ had moved closer to reality. As he
watched, four nations _ Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Turkey
_ committed to seeking financing for the 1,080-mile pipeline. The
$2.4-billion line is to originate in the offshore oilfields near
the Azeri capital of Baku, cross Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey,
then end at Turkey's Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. The main
commercial player in Baku is BP Amoco, which last month appeared to
soften its previous hostility to the project.
</P>
<P>
   A second agreement was aimed at advancing the construction of a
companion pipeline, a 1,250-mile natural gas line from
Turkmenistan, which has the world's fourth-largest natural gas
reserves, to the Turkish city of Erzurum. This proposal came from a
partnership of General Electric, Bechtel Group and Royal
Dutch/Shell Group.
</P>
<P>
   Some Clinton appointees have been accused of excessive zeal,
particularly in repeatedly predicting an imminent policy triumph.
But Clinton's own remarks reflected the still-uncertain future that
lies ahead for the Caspian nations and the pipeline project,
problems exacerbated by corruption and autocratic politics that
some experts say threaten regional instability. ``Today represents
just the beginning of the intensive commercial phase of this
project,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, a trickle of Westerners wandered onto the
Caspian, the world's largest inland body of water _ in a region
that apart from Baku itself had been largely closed to the outside
even under Czarist rule.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Attention eventually focused on two places. One was Baku, which
at the turn of the century eclipsed John D. Rockefeller's
monolithic Standard Oil as the world's largest oil producer, when
ruin came with industrial strife and the Russian revolution. The
second was Tengiz, one of the world's 10 largest oilfields, on the
northeastern shore of the Caspian in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the region has been at the heart of one of
history's rare unions of commercial venture and high-stakes
theater, dominated by figures of outsized ego, almost of all of
whom left poorer and, often, bitter, when large companies crowded
them out.
</P>
<P>
   Oil executives, diplomats and journalists spoke of so much oil _
6 to 9 billion barrels of recoverable reserves in Tengiz alone _
that the Caspian was bound to be the next Kuwait. Some said there
were 30 billion barrels, while others ventured that there could be
as much as 80 billion. Soon the often-quoted figure was 200
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The embellishment stemmed from the injection of geopolitics into
a region made up of republics unknown to most outsiders. Having
lost possession of the natural riches of its former republics,
powerful Russians sought to continue to control them. One method
was the threat of destabilization and the encouragement of ethnic
rebellions.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. companies like Amoco, Pennzoil and Unocal tried to
negotiate oil deals in Baku, unofficial arms shipments fueled wars
and coups in Azerbaijan and Georgia, felling governments and
breaking off sections of both nations.
</P>
<P>
   But Moscow's main lever of power, then as now, was its pipeline
system, a remnant of the centralized Soviet economy in which all
oil and natural gas from the Caspian first traversed Russia before
passing on to the West. In 1993, Kazakhstan learned that it could
not ship the volumes of oil it intended because the pipelines were
too full. Turkmenistan's natural gas shipments to Western Europe,
initially worth about $2 billion a year, were severed in December
1993.
</P>
<P>
   That potential chokehold inspired the current U.S. strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has argued that the West needs an alternative
to Persian Gulf oil. But a more important reason for what at the
time was considered daring, even foolhardy, U.S. assertiveness has
been to shrink Russia's backyard so that, when it gets back on its
feet, it cannot march back into the Caucasus and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   A second reason that has come to assume equal or even greater
weight in administration logic has been to challenge the possible
emergence of strong Iranian influence.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The administration's first move _ against the strong opposition
of BP Amoco's predecessor, British Petroleum _ was to promote the
construction of a relatively small export pipeline to Georgia's
Black Sea port of Supsa, avoiding Russia entirely.
</P>
<P>
   That line went into service in February, and with frequent
cutoffs of a competing Russian line because of trouble in Chechnya,
the decision to build it now seems prescient.
</P>
<P>
   The main battleground, however, has been over the direction of
the bulk of Azeri oil once exports begin peaking in 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Azeri President Heydar Aliev, has relied on White House backing
to insist on the Baku-Ceyhan route. Aliev's strategic partner in
the region is Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, whose
popularity in Washington has helped soften Aliev's reputation as an
authoritarian presiding over a particularly corrupt regime.
</P>
<P>
   In competition with Baku-Ceyhan, Moscow continues to advocate
enlargement of the existing northern route to Russia's Black Sea
port of Novorossisk _ a route now severed because it crosses
Chechnya. Moscow has dismissed critics who argue that a planned
bypass would remain vulnerable to attack by Chechen fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative that has intrigued oil companies is a
pipeline through Iran. With an outlet on the Persian Gulf, an
Iranian line would be closer to Asia, which experts say will be the
world's fastest-growing energy market.
</P>
<P>
   Some say such a pipeline would also be cheaper than Baku-Ceyhan,
but no one has fully examined the economics, and because of U.S.
enmity it is considered for now politically undoable.
</P>
<P>
   The main stumbling block to the U.S.-backed project is concern
that the Caspian has yet to turn up enough oil to justify such a
line.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The BP Amoco-led consortium has said that the minimum necessary
volume to make the pipeline feasible is 6 billion barrels of proven
reserves. The consortium's Baku fields contain an estimated 4.5
billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, BP Amoco said it would cooperate with attempts to
make the pipeline work.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts see the answer on the eastern Caspian, in
Kazakhstan. The administration is encouraged by new seismic studies
showing that Tengiz may contain 50 percent more proven recoverable
reserves than previously thought, or 9 billion to 13.5 billion
barrels. Some of that could be committed to an extension of
Baku-Ceyhan across the Caspian, the administration asserts.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The greatest attention among Baku-Ceyhan advocates has been on
an offshore Kazak field called Kashagan, a salt-topped geologic
structure that seismic studies shows is three times the size of
Tengiz.
</P>
<P>
   This year, a consortium of companies began the first of several
planned exploratory wells to see what lies inside. The consortium
includes BP Amoco, Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Mobil, Phillips, Agip
of Italy, Statoil of Norway, Inpex of Japan and Totalfina of
France.
</P>
<P>
   Even if one or more wells strike oil, though, it could be a few
years before the consortium is sure how large Kashagan's reserves
are, company executives say.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's political muscle could push matters faster. But no
one can predict the policies of the next administration, leading
many oil company executives to predict that construction of a new
pipeline will not begin until at least 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``A million things could happen,'' said one Western oil
executive, who insisted on anonymity. ``Look at how unstable the
whole region is. You'll probably have new leaders in all the
countries. So how can anyone say with any confidence that any
pipeline is a sure thing?''

STUDENT WOULD HAVE APPROVED CORNEA DONATION, FAMILY SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF PRINCE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Friends and relatives will be thrilled if the
person who receives Jerry Don Self's corneas has half his inner
vision and a tenth of his positive outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Self, 20, was among 11 people killed when a bonfire log stack
fell Thursday at Texas A&AMP;M University. He was a junior engineering
student, a member of the Corps of Cadets and a mentor to church
youth.
</P>
<P>
   His family is donating his corneas and skin. Other organs were
not suitable for transplant, a family spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Self would want any usable part of his body to go to someone
else, said his brother, Michael Self, 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was any way to help another person, he would find
it,'' he said. ``He always wanted to help.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend has established a Web site in Jerry Don Self's honor.
People can post their memories at www.lamarvikings.com/tribute
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I'll get a lot of response, just so everybody can
read it and remember Jerry, and also I can print it out and give it
to his parents,'' said Chris Mycoskie, a Lamar High School graduate
who attends the University of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Beau Riley said he could fill the Web site by himself. He met
Self at Shackelford Junior High School in 1994, and the two became
close friends over the years.
</P>
<P>
   They made an odd duo.
</P>
<P>
   Riley excelled in sports. He played quarterback at Lamar High in
Arlington and is a sophomore quarterback at Howard Payne University
in Brownwood, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Self exhibited more desire than ability, Riley said. In Riley's
old football videos, Self can be seen on the sidelines, jumping,
yelling and waving his arms, showing more enthusiasm than anyone on
the field or in the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   The gangly Self saw limited playing time, but he stuck with
football and eventually started a few games before graduating in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Riley had long hair. Self's hair was high and tight. When Riley
got an earring, Self told him to ``rip it out,'' Riley said,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were so different, but they were alike in their values,''
said Riley's mother, Debbie Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Self spent so much time at the Riley house that he had his own
room and kept clothes there, the family said. He let himself in
through a back door that the Rileys kept unlocked just for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew what was in the refrigerator better than I did,''
Debbie Riley said. ``He was a like a son to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Self would strike up conversations with anybody, which Beau
Riley said amazed him. Once, they were in a convenience store at
midnight waiting to pay for snacks when a surly man walked in
wearing sunglasses and apparently looking for trouble, Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Self was reading a tabloid magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saying to myself, `Jerry, don't say anything to this
guy,' '' Riley recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Self began chuckling over a story about an ``alien kidnapping''
and showed the article to the tough guy, Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting for the guy to hit Jerry, but the guy started
laughing,'' he said. ``Jerry was about the most personable guy
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The two left for different colleges in 1997 and saw less of each
other. But they met during holidays and breaks, and the talk flowed
like old times.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said that Self's enthusiasm had only grown since he
enrolled at Texas A&AMP;M. The cadet was carrying a full load of
classes, holding two part-time jobs, helping a family in need and
working with youth at church.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was putting in overtime, doing all this for everybody,''
Riley said. ``God just called him home for early retirement. I
don't blame him. I'd want him on my team, too.''

BC AIMS TO CREATE A HAPPIER ENDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ To a man, members of Boston College's
football team remember the pain of last year's 31-26 loss against
Notre Dame. BC's Senior Day was ruined when, on the game's final
play, Fighting Irish safety Deke Cooper came slashing into the
backfield on a ``Razor'' defensive call and dropped All-America
running back Mike Cloud for a 1-yard loss on fourth and goal from
the ND 1.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tom O'Brien called it ``one of the hardest losses I've
been associated with.'' It was a harder pill for him to swallow
than even the loss to Navy, his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year those guys got away with one, stopping us down at
the goal line,'' said junior running back Cedric Washington, who
needs just 28 yards to reach 1,000 for the season. ``Coach O'Brien
has told us to forget about that, but we've all been thinking about
it. We owe them one.''
</P>
<P>
   So, on the sixth anniversary of BC's momentous 41-39 upset of a
top-ranked Notre Dame squad, the Eagles (7-2) are in South Bend
looking for revenge. Having waited a year for this opportunity, the
Eagles will enter this game riding a wave of emotion that has been
building since way before last week's stirring 34-17 victory over
West Virginia at Alumni Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think so,'' said O'Brien, who will be looking to even
his BC record at 16-16. ``When you play a game that's obviously a
rival for us _ I don't even know if Notre Dame looks upon us as a
rival yet _ but after losing the way we did last year, there's a
lot of feeling and sentiment among the team that they have to set
that situation right.''
</P>
<P>
   The game will mean as much to the Big East as it does to BC, as
the Eagles will be aiming to become the second conference team in a
row to pin Notre Dame (5-5) with a loss. Pittsburgh brought down
the house with a 37-27 victory over the Fighting Irish last week in
the final game at 74-year-old Pitt Stadium. Saturday, BC can
virtually clinch a berth in the Insight.com Bowl Dec. 31 in Tucson
and simultaneously knock Notre Dame out of contention for a Big
East bowl slot.
</P>
<P>
   What could be sweeter than that?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be sweet regardless of the situation that
happened last year,'' said junior quarterback Tim Hasselbeck, who
was recruited by the Irish and acknowledged this week he initially
had chosen Notre Dame before having second thoughts and deciding
upon BC. ``I think a lot of the guys know we can beat those guys.
They're probably saying the same thing, but I feel we have a lot of
momentum going on offense and we've gotten better each week. We're
starting to figure things out a little bit. Our defense is playing
well, guys are making plays. So we just have to believe in
ourselves when we go there. We just have to go out and have fun and
realize we don't have anything to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien agreed. ``The pressure will all be on Notre Dame,'' he
said, ``because they've got to win their last two games (against BC
and at Stanford) to get into a bowl game.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is the last thing on Bob Davie's mind right now. The
third-year Notre Dame coach is just hoping his mentally and
physically battered team can muster enough energy to stagger across
the finish line, let alone make it to postseason.
</P>
<P>
   By Davie's count, Notre Dame has lost 16 players to injuries and
five others to disciplinary action. ``You're talking about 21
scholarship players,'' he said. ``It affects a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Things like offense, defense, and special teams _ to name a few.
And yet, amazingly, the Irish remain 9-point favorites over BC,
which is ranked in both polls (No. 25 in the Associated Press
writers' poll, No. 22 in the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll). One
suspects the reasons Notre Dame is favored are the home-field
advantage and quarterback Jarious Jackson, the type of athletic
option quarterback (does Donovan McNabb come to mind?) who has
given BC's defense fits in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one expects us to beat Notre Dame, even though we're ranked
in the Top 25 and they're not,'' Hasselbeck said. ``We're still the
underdogs. We really have nothing to lose, because no one expected
us to be where we are right now.''
</P>
<P>
   No one, that is, except the members of a BC football team with
bad memories about last year's finish against the Irish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they could forget it,'' O'Brien said. ``It was
one of the hardest losses I've ever been associated with,
especially for these kids and the amount of effort they put into
that game. We've been practicing and playing since that game last
year to be mentally tough in those situations, and we've only
failed once this year, against Miami. So there would be nothing
better than to be in that situation at South Bend _ and to win.''

<P>
   The feud with Britain over France's refusal to import British
beef may be over soon. France is considering a European Commission
proposal to allow the meat to be labeled in a way that indicates it
comes from Britain. The commission normally forbids labeling that
mentions the country of origin. But in this case, the commission
said, the labeling would be an indication that the meat had been
produced in accordance with health provisions.

   The archbishop of Naples, Cardinal Michele Giordano, has been
indicted on charges that he took part with his brother in a

fund. The slaying for which his brother Augusto is now blamed ended
any hope of determining who gave to the fund and who took bribes
from it.

 &HT;    Jarrett eyeing Augusta's plush fairways
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that Dale Jarrett has accomplished his dream of
winning the Winston Cup championship, he has a new goal: to play a
round of golf at Augusta National.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play at Augusta, that would definitely be a dream come true
for me,'' Jarrett said. ``I've only seen the course on TV, and it
is so beautiful. And I couldn't imagine what it would be like to
see it in person. Maybe, if I'm lucky, I'll get the opportunity to
play there one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, 42, is an avid golfer and was offered several
scholarships out of high school. He always has said that
professional golf would have been his career choice if he hadn't
followed in the footsteps of his father, two-time Winston Cup
champion Ned Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month before this year's U.S. Open, Jarrett played
Pinehurst No. 2 and posted a round of 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would've been a better score if I had not double-bogeyed on
the last hole,'' said Jarrett, who is a scratch golfer.
</P>
<P>
   Since clinching the series title last Sunday at Homestead-Miami
Speedway, Jarrett has been deluged with phone calls, faxes and
e-mails from well-wishers. Jarrett also said he has tentatively
been scheduled to appear as a guest on ``Late Night With David
Letterman'' for Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
   TODAY'S ARCA RACE
</P>
<P>
   Bill Baird clinched the ARCA Bondo/Mar-Hyde championship last
month at Talladega Speedway, but he has another trophy to chase in
the Georgia Boot 400 at 1 p.m. today at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Baird, who will start fifth, has to finish 19th or better to win
the Superspeedway Challenge, which is a competition that offers
points on speedways over a mile on the ARCA Series.
</P>
<P>
   BODINE SELLS OUT
</P>
<P>
   With Brett Bodine selling the ownership of his race team, Bill
Elliott and Dave Marcis are the only remaining driver/owners on the
Winston Cup circuit. Richard Hilton has bought out the No. 11 team,
which will be sponsored next year by Ralphs Supermarkets of
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough decision,'' Bodine said Friday. ``This was the
right move for this team. We'll have a much brighter future with
Richard at the helm.''
</P>
<P>
   GLOVER TO STAY
</P>
<P>
   Tony Glover, who is crew chief for Joe Nemechek, will remain in
the same position with No. 42 BellSouth Chevy next year when Kenny
Irwin takes over the driving responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin had no problems with Glover being his new crew chief.
``That was the biggest reason I got into the 42 car, because of
Tony Glover,'' Irwin said.
</P>
<P>
   SIGHT OF DAY
</P>
<P>
   Youngster David Ragan must have felt like a big-time racer on
Friday at Atlanta Motor Speedway. The 13-year old from Stockbridge
got to have his press conference before Dale Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   Ragan is this year's National Bandolero champion in the Young
Guns division. Rudy's Farm revealed on Friday that it will sponsor
Ragan as he moves up to a Legend car next year.
</P>
<P>
   FOYT CHOOSES DRIVER
</P>
<P>
   Auto racing legend A.J. Foyt made a surprise appearance in the
Infield Media Center to officially introduce Mike Bliss as the
driver for Foyt's Winston Cup team in 2000. Bliss has finished in
the top 10 of the Craftsman Truck Series the past five years, and
bought his way out of the contract with Roush Racing to pursue a
career on NASCAR's top circuit.

U.S. MISSILE-DEFENSE PLANS TRIGGER COMPLAINTS FROM EUROPEAN
ALLIES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senior State Department official flew to NATO
headquarters this week to defend the administration's plans to
deploy a national missile defense system in the face of growing
criticism from European allies who say their security is being
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott appeared before NATO
ambassadors in Brussels, explaining American intentions and
``getting an earful of complaints'' from the Europeans, according
to a senior diplomat here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first time the Americans really discussed with us
their plans for a missile defense that could become a big divide
between us,'' said the European diplomat. ``It is very late to wait
to talk to your allies.''
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton prepares to decide next summer whether to
build a $20-billion national missile-defense system, the European
allies have joined Russia and China in questioning why the United
States needs to move so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in his right mind would argue that this is welcome
timing,'' Talbott said in an interview. ``It is necessary because
of what we need to do and when we need to do it in order to respond
to a looming threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbott's consultation was only the first of what will be many
high-level meetings with the European allies on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the European complaints voiced in Brussels was the
administration's threat, stated with even greater firmness by
leading Republican candidates for the presidency, that the United
States might withdraw from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
if necessary to field the system.
</P>
<P>
   Under that treaty, Russia and the United States are restricted
to deploying only one, limited ballistic missile system to defend a
small area of their countries. The administration now is
negotiating with Russia to alter the treaty to allow for the
construction of a missile defense system to protect the entire
country from a limited attack by a state with an emerging missile
threat, such as North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott said he answered questions from the ambassadors during
his discussions in Brussels. ``I gave a very thorough review of
where we stood on the program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also described the negotiations between Russia and the United
States and ``the thinking within our government after the several
rounds we've had with the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   The European ambassadors also voiced deep misgivings about the
impact this would have on all arms control measures. Several
officials, according to a European diplomat here, asked whether the
deployment, even if approved by Russia, would trigger a new arms
race as other countries felt compelled to find ways around a new
missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Others said they feared that a separate American defense system
would undermine the trans-Atlantic defense system since Europe
would be left unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ballistic missile defenses have become the hub where relations
with Russia and China intersect, the future of nonproliferation
intersects and where our European allies express their most severe
disgruntlement with the American leadership,'' said George
Perkovich, director at W. Alton Jones Foundation and author of
``India's Nuclear Bomb'' (University of California, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Two European nations will play a pivotal role in the missile
defense debate. The United States wants to upgrade the
early-warning radars it maintains in Greenland and Great Britain to
make them part of this new system.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, Alaska will be home to the system, including
at least 20 interceptor missiles ready to shoot down incoming
missiles. As part of the warning system, the United States would
also use satellites and radar stations in the United States, as
well as the two overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are under way with Copenhagen, for the site in
Greenland, a Danish territory, and London, according to an American
official, but neither country has given its approval yet to include
the radar stations in the new American system.

AGAINST GRANT, GOLOTA MUST CHANGE HIS TACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY _ Michael Grant gets his next chance Saturday
night. Andrew Golota may be getting his last chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Foul Pole, as Golota has been called ever since he was twice
disqualified against Riddick Bowe for repeated low blows, is on a
six-fight win streak since he was destroyed in 95 seconds by Lennox
Lewis two years ago, but he has yet to face a stiff test. Quite a
few stiffs, but no stiff tests.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7-inch Grant certainly qualifies as the latter,
although his opponents haven't exactly been murderer's row, either.
Undefeated and at 30-0, Grant is already being mentioned as a
possible opponent for Lewis, but to even be considered, Grant must
first get by the formidable opposition Golota sometimes can offer
when he's not being pursued by the local boxing constabulary for
some heinous act.
</P>
<P>
   Grant is big, strong, and powerful, having stopped 20 of his 30
victims, but he is coming off a lackluster performance against well
worn but physically imposing Lou Savarese in his last outing. Grant
has promised HBO executives a better performance Saturday (9:30,
preceded by the Lewis-Evander Holyfield replay) and a spectacular
win would cement his position as the division's leading contender
despite the fact he is not rated No. 1 by any of boxing's three
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, however, Grant must not only beat Golota, he must
overcome the mental pressure Golota's often felonious tactics make
a part of the equation. Although he has been foul free during his
six-fight comeback since the loss to Lewis, Golota perhaps tried to
plant a seed of doubt in Grant's mind Thursday at the final press
conference at Trump Taj Mahal when he was asked about the
possibility of taking some action that would make the Marquis of
Queensbury whince.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is boxing,'' Golota (34-3, 28 KOs) said stoically.
``Sometimes things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Bowe, who was never the same after Golota hit him low a
half-dozen times in their two fights, including once with a
combination, which is all but unheard of. By their second fight,
Bowe was a shadow of himself and hasn't fought since. That was not
all Golota's doing, but he didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   Now he hopes to be a bit more circumspect in his ring behavior,
but still intends to do as much harm to Grant as possible because
if he can upset him, he knows he will shoot to the top of Lewis's
list because of his own marketability. In fact, if he can just put
on a strong showing win or lose, his handlers believe he could end
up fighting Vitali Klitschko in Germany for the World Boxing
Organization portion of the crown and a big payday.
</P>
<P>
   That is a lesser title than the ones Lewis holds and Grant seeks
but it would be a start, a start he began only weeks after Lewis
wiped the floor with him at the Boardwalk Convention Center Oct. 4,
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``They dismissed me as a fighter (after that),'' Golota said.
``They forgot about me. They stopped believing in me. I stopped
believing in me. It was the worst fight of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, Golota and trainer Roger Bloodwirth began the long climb
back from the oblivion that comes with being utterly destroyed in a
title fight. The process began only after Bloodwirth and Golota
spoke and both agreed they would willingly take short money and
what fights they could find to get Golota back into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Wins over the likes of Jesse Ferguson and Corey Sanders were
hardly awe inspiring, but they got Golota into play again and
because all six wins were foul free, they eventually got him back
into the ring with a major force in the heavyweight division in
Grant.
</P>
<P>
   What the 4-1 underdog does with Grant is another matter, but if
he is on his game and firing above the belt line the way he did
against Bowe, the Foul Pole may find himself in play again by the
time this night is over.

AFTER FAILING WITH REVOLUTION, COACH HAS UNITED ON BRINK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas Rongen has been at both ends of the Major League Soccer
coaching spectrum, going from coach of the year in 1996 to possibly
worst coach of the year in '98 to the MLS Cup final.
</P>
<P>
   Rongen's appearance with D.C. United in Sunday's game against
the Los Angeles Galaxy could certainly reaffirm his coaching
reputation, but it also provides some clues about the continuing
problems of the Revolution, who were 17-35-6 under Rongen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year was status quo and we made the playoffs,''
Rongen said Friday. ``But I wanted to win the big one and I didn't
think that group was good enough to challenge D.C. or Columbus, or
LA if we ever got in the finals. I decided to make changes and it
backfired. Overall, we didn't do a good job. But I learned from it
and I'll never make the same mistakes again.''
</P>
<P>
   Rongen believes in building the team around a core of players,
who basically set standards of behavior and style of play. In New
England, this group was unable to lead the way, and their lack of
sophistication became even more apparent as they floundered under
Walter Zenga this season. The Revolution used 12 foreign players
during Rongen's tenure, none of whom survived to the end of last
season.
</P>
<P>
   But the formula has functioned well with D.C. United, which has
a credible and highly competent core group, revolving around the
midfield creativity and quiet confidence of Marco Etcheverry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a meeting before the season,'' Rongen said, ``and Marco
said: `the only reason we are here is to win championships, and if
you don't believe in that, there's the door.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But, though Rongen has met regular-season expectations with D.C.
United, he still has a crucial test against the Galaxy. United has
struggled in tournament play since falling, 2-0, to Chicago in last
year's Cup final. Under Rongen, United was eliminated from the US
Open Cup by the Charleston Battery and the CONCACAF Champions Cup
by Necaxa.
</P>
<P>
   The United image of invulnerability was dented by these defeats
and by a 5-1 loss at Columbus two weeks ago. But D.C. recovered for
a 4-0 win over the Crew last week, sparked by Etcheverry, in one of
the team's most dominating performances ever in tournament play.
</P>
<P>
   So, the perception of Rongen has once again been bolstered. But
the lasting image of this season will be provided by the title
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we need to prove anything,'' Rongen said. ``We
set our goals high and we have one big one left. It will be a huge
disappointment if we don't win this game. But in a one-off
situation like this, anything can happen. LA is very balanced and
they won't allow Marco and Jaime (Moreno) as much freedom as
Columbus did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have players who can single-handedly dictate the game. They
are big-time players, money players. They are gifted players, and
in one moment they can make the difference. We play good football
and consistent football and that is the trademark of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The soccer fates are fickle. Rongen's last game as Revolution
coach was at Foxboro Stadium, a disastrous 5-1 defeat Aug. 22,
1998. The opponent was the Los Angeles Galaxy.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech and Georgia still are a week away from
their annual showdown. But in three neighboring states, this is
Rivalry Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest showdown is in Gainesville, Fla., where No. 1
Florida State meets No. 3 Florida. As usual, a lot more is at stake
than just Sunshine State bragging rights.
</P>
<P>
   With a win, the Seminoles (10-0) can nail down a spot in the
Sugar Bowl national title game. If the Gators (9-1) win, they still
have to win the SEC championship game on Dec. 4 to earn a trip to
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   For the 12th consecutive year, FSU and Florida both are in the
Top 10 for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way it should be,'' Florida State defensive tackle
Corey Simon said. ``Two great teams slugging it out, and the guy
left standing gets to move on.''

   _ Alabama can earn the right to play Florida in the SEC title
game by beating Auburn today. The Crimson Tide (8-2) is looking for
its first win in Auburn's Jordan-Hare Stadium. Auburn (5-5) needs a
victory to qualify for a bowl. Auburn has won all four of the
previous meetings at home against Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   _ The records at Clemson (5-5) and South Carolina (0-10) aren't
what their fans were hoping for, but that won't diminish the
intensity when the Tigers and Gamecocks square off in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   _ Georgia Tech (7-2) tries to keep its Orange Bowl hopes alive
in today's ACC game at Wake Forest. If the Yellow Jackets can win
today and beat Georgia next week, they have an outside shot at
earning a major bowl bid as an at-large team in the BCS.
</P>
<P>
   Tech also will be trying to keep alive the Heisman Trophy hopes
of quarterback Joe Hamilton. Wisconsin's Ron Dayne picked up a lot
of support by setting the NCAA career rushing record last week. But
Hamilton, the ACC's all-time total offense leader, has two games
left to sway voters.
</P>
<P>
   _ At Oxford, Miss., Georgia's season is in trouble as the
Bulldogs (6-3) visit Ole Miss (7-2). Georgia was embarrassed by
Auburn 38-21 last week in Athens and will take on a Mississippi
team that whipped Arkansas 38-16 in its last game, Nov. 6.

UNDERSTATEMENT, AT $5 BILLION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., N.Y., Fla.)   (af)  
 By STEVE BARNES

<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Back in the late 1970s, when Warren A.
Stephens was an MBA student at Wake Forest University, he savored
the prospect of making it on his own. But he was urged homeward to
the family business by a favorite professor who admonished him to
ignore any resentment from others over his lineage.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what he did, the professor said, ``You're not going to
be able to prove anything to the people who want you to prove
something.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 76, Jackson T. (Jack) Stephens Sr. remains the chairman
and the revered embodiment of the family empire here, of which the
Stephens Inc. investment firm is only a part.
</P>
<P>
   But with his father slowed by a stroke about a year ago, Warren
Stephens, his second son, is effectively in charge, after having
quietly managed things day-to-day for more than a decade. Stephens,
42, runs holdings valued by a senior official of the family's
parent company at about $5 billion, more than triple a Forbes
magazine estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Besides owning Stephens Inc., the investment banking firm
founded in 1933 by Stephens' late uncle, W.R. (Witt) Stephens, the
Stephens Group also has major stakes in energy (the
Arkansas-Oklahoma Gas Co.), newspapers (the Donrey Media Group),
telecommunications (the Alltel Corp.) and banks (Bank of America,
among others).
</P>
<P>
   The Stephens Group has six corporate jets and, apart from the
headquarters here, offices in six cities in the United States and
in London. A New York office, a Stephens associate suggests, may be
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The understated Warren Stephens style often resembles the Jack
Stephens style. Warren Stephens and his wife, Harriet, appear
infrequently in the society pages and zealously guard their privacy
and that of their three children.
</P>
<P>
   From his father, Stephens also inherited an addiction to golf.
(His handicap is 6.) He is known to play solo at the Country Club
of Little Rock, next to his home in the old-money Pulaski Heights.
More storied fairways are a Falcon jet flight away. In Georgia,
Stephens recently followed his father, chairman emeritus of Augusta
National, in becoming a member.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, he is willing to tell a joke on himself. If his
office, in his family's 25-story tower here, is a study in
expensive understatement, the squat bottle on his credenza _ of an
orange-colored beverage with an off-color brand name _ seems
pointedly out of place.
</P>
<P>
   ``A reminder of a bad investment,'' Stephens groaned. ``I think
you can still find some of it down in the Village.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference to Greenwich Village, as if it were just a
10-minute cab ride from downtown Little Rock, is a reminder of his
new presence in New York. He recently spent about $8 million on a
five-story town house in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   But even the hint that he might become as much a New Yorker as
an Arkansan makes him bristle. ``We're not moving,'' he said,
cutting off further discussion. An aide said Stephens and his wife
merely wanted a base there for their frequent business and social
forays.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens, the youngest of two sons (Jackson Stephens Jr. is not
associated with the firm) assumed more authority much earlier than
he expected. One day in 1986, Jack Stephens announced that he
wanted to play golf more often and appointed Warren, then 29, as
president and chief executive of both Stephens Inc. and the
Stephens Group.
</P>
<P>
   Under Warren Stephens, the business has jettisoned the
low-margin clearing of securities transactions for banks to focus
on public and corporate finance and capital management. A
prospering division that manages pension funds was created. Days
ago, Stephens announced the offering of online trading early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   If the Stephens ship has become more streamlined, it has not
avoided every iceberg. Recent allegations involving five employees
_ two were convicted of bribing a Florida water commissioner to
obtain a bond underwriting _ cost the company $6 million in fines
and settlements.
</P>
<P>
   But those embarrassments pale against what Stephens considers
the insults his family and state have endured during the presidency
of his fellow Arkansan. ``Over all, net-net, the image of Arkansas
under the Clinton presidency has been a big negative,'' Stephens
grumbled. ``When The Wall Street Journal questions `Arkansas
mores,' that hurts the image of the state. The sad thing about it
is that I would put Arkansas mores up against Wall Street mores any
day of the week, and we'll come out head and shoulders above
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephens still simmers over a controversy involving the Riady
family of Indonesia and its Lippo Group conglomerate. The two clans
were partners in a bank here that later lent Clinton's campaign
crucial funds during the 1992 New York primary. Stephens, calling
the loan merely a smart business decision, said the Riadys had sold
their interest in the bank well before Clinton ran for president.
</P>
<P>
   The Riadys were later accused of funneling improper
contributions to Democrats including Clinton, and fronting for the
government of China _ accusations the Riadys have denied. The
Stephens family was never accused of doing anything wrong, but was
often cited as among the Riady family's influential associates.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens himself was a Bob Dole backer in 1996 and supports
Steve Forbes this year.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' recent repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which forbade
banks from buying or owning investment companies, is of little
moment to Stephens, who declares: ``The family is not interested in
selling.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does taking the firm public, a la Goldman Sachs, have any
allure. ``To go public you have to have some need for the money,''
Stephens said. ``We're not running short.''

   Bidding for the Auctioneer Is Right Up Their Alley &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Haven't seen enough of Meg Whitman, the high-profile chief
executive of online auctioneer eBay? If profiles in Business Week,
Glamour and Vanity Fair left you begging for more, maybe you should
consider bowling.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield, the old-time San
Francisco auction house that was recently acquired by eBay,
auctioned off a bowling date with Ms. Whitman and two eBay
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine bids were submitted over 10 days to raise money for
the San Francisco chapter of the American Red Cross. The first bid
was a mere $75, but, like everything related to the Internet, the
price soared, to $11,600.
</P>
<P>
   The lucky bidder? A group from Yahoo's auction team paid for the
fun of dropping pins and what the auction's description called a
``less than swanky meal'' with the eBay group. With their combined
billions, they might as well just buy the alley.

   Let Ed Bass sponsor over-the-top environmental projects like
Biosphere II. Lee and Ramona Bass, perhaps the most private members
of a very private family, support more down-to-earth, even
down-home, projects like parks and a zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year or so, they have pledged $12 million toward
the $35 million cost of a new ``Texas Wild!'' feature at the Fort
Worth Zoo; the eight-acre site is set to open next October.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis, befitting the state, will be more on claw and jaw
than cuddly and cute. The South Texas habitat will include bald
eagles, quail, road runners, mountain lions, bobcats and jaguars.
The West Texas habitat will have bats, horned toads, black-footed
ferrets, tarantulas and scorpions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the zoo, then run by the city, was almost forced to
close for lack of money. But Mrs. Bass, the zoo co-chair since
1989, was convinced that if run with private funds, it could
thrive. Her recent $12 million came on top of other gifts totaling
$15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Her love of Texas wildlife dates back to her youth and her
family's South Texas ranch. ``Some of my fondest childhood memories
are the hours I spent with my grandfather working cattle and riding
horseback through the pastures,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bass is currently chairman of the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Commission. The Basses also support the American Zoological
Association's Species Survival Plan for the endangered black
rhinoceros, breeding and raising the animals on their South Texas
ranch.

   The latest advice on cyber-etiquette: unplug your old office
equipment if you're dealing with people who make their living from
the Web. Brewster Kahle, chief executive of Alexa Internet, which
he recently sold to Amazon.com for nearly $300 million, recently
told the New York Infotech Forum that he communicates with his
lawyers and accountants over the Internet, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they fax us anything,'' he warned, ``we look for a new
one.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not kidding. E-mail addiction is a key test for lawyers or
accountants wanting his business. ``Everyone says they have e-mail,
but many do not live on it,'' Kahle said, in an exchange of
e-mails. ``We only want to deal with those that cannot live without
an e-mail fix no matter where they are or what they are doing.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   What next, a patent on the human heart? No, but a production
line for kits so surgeons can build hearts, maybe. William
Haseltine, the highflying chief executive of Human Genome Sciences,
raised that possibility last week.
</P>
<P>
   His company, which aims to develop medical applications for
human genes, has already helped produce a drug, now in testing,
meant to generate new vessels when injected into the heart. In
other words, a bypass without surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Haseltine has far greater ambitions over the longer run. ``I'm
part of a 25-year plan to reconstruct a heart,'' which could then
be implanted, he said in a speech to the Committee for Economic
Development in New York. He was referring to a group of business
people and scholars led by Michael V. Sefton of the University of
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Haseltine is already deep in a debate over the extent to which
gene sequencing research should be freely available or patented by
companies like his. No patents on complete organs are likely, he
said after his speech, adding, ``It won't be like you have a
central hospital in Iowa pumping out human hearts.''

GORE CAMPAIGN PLANS MORE FUND-RAISERS, LESS SPENDING AND TACTICAL
TRAVEL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER WITH KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fund raising for Vice President Al Gore's
presidential campaign is lagging, forcing Gore to add new
money-raising events and slash spending, campaign officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore expected to have completed all of his major fund-raising
events for the primary campaign by the middle of November, but
instead he has added at least three more fund-raisers to meet the
campaign's $4 million target for the October-December period.
</P>
<P>
   The first of these was held on Thursday night in McLean, Va., at
the home of Terry McAuliffe, President Clinton's chief fund-raiser,
and brought in about $200,000. Events planned for New York and
Nashville in December are expected to raise more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore said that the campaign was in strong financial
shape, but the hurriedly scheduled fund-raisers and a campaignwide
effort to cut costs belied their assertion.
</P>
<P>
   The money crunch has also led Gore to schedule more official
events in his role as vice president, using his office to make
policy announcements that are not overtly related to the campaign
and thus can be paid for with taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, campaigning in New Hampshire Friday, said his plan was
``not to use the official events to campaign,'' but ``to promote
the administration's ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought this was appropriate, Gore said: ``Sure. To
use official events to promote the administration's agenda? I don't
know why it wouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to conserve scarce dollars at the presidential
campaign, Gore closed fund-raising offices in Washington and
California Friday, with all efforts now concentrated in Nashville
and New York. The overall fund-raising staff has been reduced to
six people, from a peak of 40 this summer and early fall, a senior
Gore adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's political traveling party has been cut from
six or seven to just two aides, Michael Feldman, a political
adviser, and Chris Lehane, the press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries at Gore headquarters in Nashville have been capped at
$95,000 a year, down from the $180,000 a year that some advisers
were making before the severity of the financial crunch became
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's public appearances and private fund-raising events have
been simplified, eliminating studio-type lighting for town meetings
with voters as well as elaborate menus for money-raising dinners.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said that all major fund-raising efforts would be
completed by the end of the year, yielding more than $40 million.
The overall figure includes an estimated $13 million in federal
matching funds and $4 million to cover the legal and accounting
costs of meeting federal campaign finance regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign applied for $9.2 million in federal matching
funds in early October and expects the request to be approved by
the Federal Election Commission as early as Monday, Lehane said. A
second filing, for about $4.5 million, will be submitted in early
January, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign expects to raise nearly $3 million in the early
months of next year, chiefly through direct-mail appeals and
donations solicited over the Internet. Gore has already raised more
than $500,000 over the Internet; the campaign of Gore's Democratic
rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, announced this week
that he had raised more than $1 million through his Web site.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore's advisers became alarmed at the end of September when the
profligate spending became apparent, leaving his campaign with less
money in the bank than Bradley's even though Gore had raised $5
million more than Bradley. On Oct. 1, Gore reported $10.3 million
cash on hand; Bradley had $10.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns have to report figures on donations and spending only
every three months, so a current comparison is not available.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to schedule three additional big-dollar events
is a clear sign that the vice president has had trouble meeting his
fund-raising targets and that spending continues to be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore moved his campaign headquarters to Nashville from
Washington last month, he said he was doing so to be closer to his
Tennessee roots and to the voters. But he also hoped to sharply
reduce the costs of running his campaign out of Washington,
including $60,000 a month in rent. The new headquarters, in a
former suite of medical offices in Nashville, rents for roughly a
third of that.
</P>
<P>
   A December dinner in Nashville is the last planned major
fund-raising event, with a goal of roughly $1 million, a senior
Gore adviser said. ``We're not calling it the Super Bowl, and we
don't rule out doing additional events later on, but this is the
major push,'' the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no current plans to again call on President Clinton's
fund-raising prowess to assist the vice president, the adviser
said. Clinton appeared at three Gore events in August and September
that yielded more than $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, confident that he will prevail in his primary battle with
Bradley, is already looking ahead to the spring post-primary period
when his campaign treasury will be emptied by travel and television
advertising costs.
</P>
<P>
   He is scouring the federal government for program and policy
announcements that he can make in his role as vice president that
will give him opportunities then to generate news coverage that he
will not have to pay for, Lehane said.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ This look at five of the victims of the bonfire
accident includes shorter profiles of six other A&AMP;M students and a
graduate who died Thursday: Christopher Breen, Jeremy Frampton,
Bryan Allan McClain, Jerry Self, Chad Powell and Jamie Hand.

<P>
   LUCAS JOHN KIMMEL
</P>
<P>
   When Lucas John Kimmel was in junior high school, he already had
his life planned out. In an essay for his Boy Scout troop, Kimmel
wrote that he planned to graduate from high school, attend Texas
A&AMP;M University, major in veterinary science and join the Corps of
Cadets. Then, he wrote, he wanted to join the Army as a
veterinarian and spend four to eight years in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel, who turned 19 on Nov. 14, was well on his way to
fulfilling his goals when he was killed in the bonfire collapse.
</P>
<P>
   He had done well at Tuloso-Midway High School in Corpus Christi.
He was a member of the National Honor Society, 4-H, the swim team
and track team.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel entered Texas A&AMP;M this fall, joining the Corps and
studying biomedical science as a precursor to veterinary medicine.
He had several scholarships, including an ROTC award.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew exactly what he wanted to do,'' said Kyle Warner, 17,
a good friend of Kimmel's from high school. ``He had everything
laid out. He was going to do it. But now he doesn't get to.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel was known among his friends for his incredible energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would show up at 7 a.m. for practice and swim for two
hours,'' Warner said. ``Most of us would be using every bit of
energy we could to get out of the pool, and Lucas is running around
yelling at the top of his lungs, one of those songs he sang, or his
enthusiastic chants.''
</P>
<P>
   John Thurston, the scout executive for the Gulf Coast Council,
Boy Scouts of America, described Kimmel as an ``outstanding'' young
man who was an altar boy at St. Anthony's Catholic Church as well
as a Eagle Scout.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel served as an assistant scoutmaster when he was home,
Thurston says. Thursday night, many of the scouts in his troop
attended a memorial service at his family's church.
</P>
<P>
   Being an Aggie was in Kimmel's blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``His brother went to Texas A&AMP;M; his father went,'' Kimmel's
uncle, Barry Wood, told the Corpus Christi Caller-Times. ``It's
just something the family does.''
</P>
<P>
   Dee Hargis, Kimmel's high school swim coach and longtime friend,
described him as someone who put his whole heart into whatever he
was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he got into the pool to swim, he would just give 110
percent,'' Hargis told the Caller-Times. Hargis said that Kimmel
was on top of the wood pyramid when it collapsed. Being at the top
was typical of his will to work harder than those around him, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it fell down, I know how tough it was for his spirit,''
Hargis said. ``I thought he'd hang on.''
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL EBANKS
</P>
<P>
   Even in elementary school, Michael Ebanks of Carrollton knew he
would follow his much older brother to Texas A&AMP;M University. He
could not have known that he also would follow his brother in death
at too young an age.
</P>
<P>
   Ebanks, 19, a freshman in aerospace engineering, was one of the
last students to be pulled from the timbers of the Aggie bonfire
early Friday, nearly 24 hours after it collapsed. As Thursday wore
on, his mother, Bulinda, told a close friend of her fears.
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``'I'm sure his brother Keith has received him with
open arms,''' said Renai Lackey, a teacher at Furneaux Elementary
School in Carrollton. ``I said, 'Bulinda, you don't know that. He
will fight for every breath in his body.'''
</P>
<P>
   No one at Furneaux, which Michael had attended, wanted to
believe that Bulinda and Gerald Ebanks would lose two of their
three children.
</P>
<P>
   Keith, a 1989 A&AMP;M graduate, was killed in a freak accident in
July 1994 as he and his fiance were hauling furniture in the rain.
Keith had pulled over to put a tarp over the furniture. A car lost
control and struck him. He was 27.
</P>
<P>
   Michael ``lived to go to A&AMP;M and work on the bonfire,'' Lackey
said.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to be an astronaut and had already earned his pilot's
license. He graduated in the spring with advanced honors from
Newman Smith High in Carrollton. Within a few hours Friday,
students in the school's DECA marketing club in which Michael was a
member had raised $1,000 for a memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very bright ... and had a broad circle of friends,''
Principal Lee Alvoid said.
</P>
<P>
   Alvoid recalled Ebanks' good looks and sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was vain enough that he didn't like his senior ID so he
kept figuring out ways to keep getting it made over,'' she said.
``He kept coming back through the line, trying to disguise
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   MIRANDA ADAMS
</P>
<P>
   Students and faculty at Santa Fe High School in Galveston County
donned maroon and white ribbons Friday in remembrance of a popular
honor student _ Miranda Adams, whose body was among the last two
recovered from the Aggie Bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miranda now makes the fourth recent graduate we have lost
three in months,'' Principal Gary Causey said from the high school
where the flag was flown at half mast.
</P>
<P>
   The three others were killed in car-related accidents, including
two of whom were struck by a vehicle as they walked to a Texas A&AMP;M
fraternity party in October. Six died in all.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, a 19-year-old sophomore majoring in biomedical sciences,
planned to be a physician's assistant. She became impressed by the
bonfire as a freshman and this year was a co-chair of the bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   Adams played saxophone in the high school band, served on
student council and was in National Honor Society. She graduated in
the top 2 percent of her class, received a Presidential Fitness
Award and was in the math and engineering clubs, A&AMP;M records show.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the kind of kid every principal wishes all of his kids
would be like,'' Causey said.
</P>
<P>
   Her grandmother, Mary Adams, said Miranda was active at Peace
Lutheran Church in Texas City and looking forward to working in the
church's summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very special,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said that people who had been at the scene said they
thought Miranda died instantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kind of relieved to hear that,'' Adams said, starting
to cry. ``Now, she's with the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   NATHAN SCOTT WEST
</P>
<P>
   With an SAT score of 1430, Nathan Scott West could have had his
pick of colleges. But Texas A&AMP;M University was his dream.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to be a member of the Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was born and bred to be an Aggie,'' said Richard Evans, a
teacher at Westbury High School in Houston, where West graduated in
the top 5 percent of his graduating class.
</P>
<P>
   West, 19, was a sophomore at A&AMP;M, majoring in ocean engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a quiet guy and very, very intelligent,'' said Andrew
Rivas, who is the commanding officer of C-2, West's unit in the
corps.
</P>
<P>
   Although his high school teachers called him ``Nathan,'' he was
``Scott'' to his family and friends, such as John Harris, who is
scoutmaster for Troop 211, the Boy Scout troop where West earned
his Eagle Scout in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kid was a leader,'' Harris said. ``He had a good head on
his shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   At Westbury, West was a member of the swim team and the math and
science honor society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nathan was one of my brightest _ one of my best,'' Evans said.
``He was a loner and a thinker.''
</P>
<P>
   Also during high school, West was active in his church youth
group and youth choir at Bellaire United Methodist Church, recalls
Rev. Mike Young, the church's senior pastor.
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS LEE HEARD
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Andrea and Les Heard expected their son, Chris, to
bring home two friends from college. He arrived with 14 fellow
members of the Corps of Cadets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had boys sleeping everywhere,'' said Andrea Heard, mother
of Chris Lee Heard. ``I think the reason he brought all those boys
home was that he wanted to show us what good friends he was
making.''
</P>
<P>
   That was typical of the considerate 19-year-old. He wanted his
parents to feel at ease about his school activities and friends. In
turn, he showed off his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was everything a mother wants in a child,'' Andrea Heard
said. ``He was a perfect son. He had respect for others,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Heards have another son, 22-year-old Jason, a University of
Texas graduate and a lieutenant in the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   The mother last talked to her son Tuesday night. He called to
confirm that he had signed up for the Marines the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so excited,'' she said. ``This is what he wanted in
life. His ambition was to become an ocean engineer.''
</P>
<P>
   They ended the conversation like they always did. ``We told him
we loved him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Heard made the most of his life. At the Marine Military
Academy in Harlingen, where he attended high school, he excelled.
He received the Outstanding Senior Award, a Marine sword, for
leadership. He also won the American Legion Scholastic Excellence
Award for high grades and belonging to the National Honor Society.
He was captain of the swim team his junior and senior years.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Tom Hobbs of the academy remembers Heard well. ``He was a
solid kid when he came to us and left an even greater person. He
was just superb,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTOPHER BREEN
</P>
<P>
   Breen, 25, was the son of John Breen, a civil engineering
professor at the University of Texas. A 1997 A&AMP;M graduate and Corps
member, he was visiting Texas A&AMP;M to work on the bonfire when the
accident happened.
</P>
<P>
   Breen graduated with a degree in agricultural development.
During his senior year, he was the senior coordinator for the Aggie
Bonfire as a Brown Pot, who organize labor for the bonfire
construction. Breen, an Eagle Scout, also had a passion for the
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Breen, born in Austin, graduated from Anderson High School in
1992. He is survived by his parents, John E. and Marian K. Breen of
Austin, as well as six brothers and sister.
</P>
<P>
   JEREMY FRAMPTON
</P>
<P>
   Frampton, 22, was a California boy _ a strawberry blond with a
quick smile and a positive attitude _ who for as long as anyone
could remember had maroon blood running through his veins. His
older brother, Scott, had graduated from Texas A&AMP;M University, and
his father, Richard Frampton, said Jeremy lived to be an Aggie.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Frampton _ a former football guard and the consummate
team player _ regarded the painstaking assembly the Aggie Bonfire
required as the ultimate team project.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was doing what he loved ... when he died,'' his father said
Thursday from their home in Turlock in northern California. ``That
gives me some comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   BRYAN ALLAN McCLAIN
</P>
<P>
   McClain, 19, was a freshman majoring in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   At the 2,700-student James Madison High School in San Antonio,
McClain had good grades and was on the swim team. Friends remember
him as clean-cut, well-behaved and kind.
</P>
<P>
   McClain was proud of his pickup, a 1993 Ford Supercab, and
frequently had friends over to play basketball in the street.
McClain and his friends were nice teens, according to a San Antonio
neighbor, Linda Rasmussen, ``the kind of kids that would say 'hi'
to the neighbor lady.''
</P>
<P>
   JERRY SELF
</P>
<P>
   Self, 20, was thrilled at being part of building the bonfire and
was out there every night, said Jeremy Erb, a pastor who worked
with Self at the Mid-City Bible Church in Euless..
</P>
<P>
   Known as Jerry Don in high school, Self was a bon vivant who
embraced everyone and everything, Erb said.
</P>
<P>
   Erb said Self, at 6 feet 5 inches, with dark hair and hazel
eyes, had the interest of a lot of girls but wasn't much of a
ladies man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the consummate gentleman; he opened doors,'' Erb said.
</P>
<P>
   Erb said Self, an engineering technology sophomore, was
considering joining the ministry when he graduated.
</P>
<P>
   CHAD POWELL
</P>
<P>
   Powell _ Keller High's '99 valedictorian, an Eagle Scout, a
member of the National Honor Society, the track team and the
Academic Decathlon team _ was a freshman computer sciences student
at A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the smartest guy I have ever known in my entire life,''
said Ruth Huston, a former Keller classmate whose family lives
across the street from the Powells. For all the competitive spirit
that Powell showed in school, Huston said he was equally
compassionate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an exceptional young man,'' said Penny Huston, Ruth's
mother. ``He was just a really nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   JAMIE HAND
</P>
<P>
   Friends say Jamie Hand had a little tomboy in her and are not
surprised that the vivacious freshman environmental design major
was in the thick of Thursday's bonfire activity at Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's (always) right in the middle of everything, and she's
having a ball doing it,'' said Mary Beth Fitzgerald, an assistant
principal at Henderson High School, where Hand graduated earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a cheerleader and an athlete, beautiful, just a lovely
young lady,'' Fitzgerald said.

THIS TIME, FORBES CHOOSES SUBTLE OVER SLASHING IN ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For months, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has braced
for a multimillion-dollar onslaught of attack commercials from
Steve Forbes, his wealthy rival for the Republican presidential
nomination. Finally, the first commercial has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of the ominous music that often accompanies negative
commercials, this one features carousel music mixed with a touch of
ragtime. And rather than a harsh, frontal condemnation of Bush, the
60-second commercial opens with Forbes, in shirt sleeves, chatting
with people in a diner. The candidate, hardly threatening, tells
them, ``I've challenged Gov. Bush to a series of debates so that
voters can have a chance to see what you stand for, what you
believe, why you believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, a young man asks him, ``What are some of the important
ways that you differ from George W. Bush?'' In response, Forbes
calmly critiques Bush on education and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Forbes campaign to choose subtle over
slashing underscores a turn in political advertising. Strategists
and pollsters in both parties said voters appear far less tolerant
of blatant attacks. As a result, no presidential campaign this year
has yet to broadcast scathing commercials against its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, campaigns are either going soft or, as in the case of
Forbes, looking for ways to attack without appearing as if they are
attacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ads with `Jaws' music and grainy pictures, it's like
flashing a sign that says, `Negative Ad Alert: What You're About to
See Should Not Be Believed,''' said Mark Mellman, a Democratic
pollster. ``So you have to be much more artful in delivering the
negative.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign has been so cautious, in fact, that it has
not yet broadcast the commercial of Forbes at the diner, which the
campaign provided to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials said they have not decided whether to use the
advertisement, but that no matter what, it would serve as a
prototype for their anti-Bush drive. By January, they expect to
begin broadcasting commercials that are intended to undermine Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions by the Forbes campaign over its advertising are
particularly important because they carry implications beyond
Forbes. The high-profile skirmishing in New Hampshire between Bush
and Sen. John McCain, R- Ariz., has overshadowed the fact that
Forbes, with his huge personal fortune, has the potential to jolt
the entire Republican field through his use of television.
</P>
<P>
   If his advertising blitz succeeded, Forbes could gain strength
in Iowa, where he is well organized, and in other states where he
is the only contender who has on-the-ground organizations to take
on Bush.
</P>
<P>
   For months, a looming question has been whether Forbes could
successfully spend tens of millions of dollars on negative ads
without tarnishing himself.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers want to avoid a repeat of 1996, when the publishing
magnate became known as a slash-and-burn politician for his
commercials that lacerated Bob Dole. This time, the Forbes campaign
has spent enormous sums of money to develop a fresh strategy.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The result, according to campaign officials, is that Forbes will
try to have it both ways: He plans to run commercials that attack
Bush, but not in the head-on, accusatory fashion of the
advertisements against Dole. Perhaps anticipating attacks from
Forbes, Bush and McCain have called for positive campaigning this
year. And so far, the two Democratic contenders, Vice President Al
Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, have aired only commercials that
have been decidedly upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the prototype commercial in the diner, when Forbes is asked
to explain his differences with Bush, the candidate responds:
``Well, I've put a real proposal on the table to get rid of this
corrupt tax code, give working people a real tax cut, seen nothing
from him. On education, he wants a bigger role for Washington. I
think Washington's part of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   After expounding more on the issues, Forbes tells the group, ``I
think the American people think that part of democracy is having a
serious discussion about differences. Shouldn't you learn that
before the election instead of after the election? That's what a
campaign is supposed to be about.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the strategy behind the commercial, Greg Mueller, a
media consultant for Forbes, said, ``That ad itself is not
threatening compared to '96, when you're really going at it. That
ad is a very good example of how you finesse a contrast that allows
Bush's support to chip away and fall for us rather than to another
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign has created a second commercial that mocks
Bush's ``compassionate conservative'' slogan, but is also decidedly
subtle.
</P>
<P>
   After calling for tax cuts and for letting people chose their
own doctors and schools for their children, Forbes tells viewers:
``Proposing to expand the role of government is neither
compassionate nor conservative. It's just plain more government.
Join me and let's send Washington a message.''
</P>
<P>
   That advertisement was supposed to debut this week, but Bill Dal
Col, Forbes' campaign manager, said he changed his mind because he
believed that recent news articles about Bush's grasp of issues
freed the Forbes campaign, for now, from having to go negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any doubts I want to plant about Gov. Bush and issues he has
done all by himself,'' Dal Col said. ``The environment is already
created. All we have to do is push issues hard and strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Forbes has tamed his commercials, Dal Col said,
was that the candidate is more determined to appear presidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing the same kind of ads he did four years ago undercuts
his attempts to convince people he has presidential timber,'' Dal
Col said. ``When Forbes ran four years ago he was a message
candidate. Now he believes he can be president, so it's much less
likely that he'll run the same kind of negative spots that he did
against Dole.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If Forbes is successful, he could lead the way in developing a
new genre of commercials _ and he could emerge as a major threat to
Bush. But the effort is fraught with peril. If the commercials are
not calibrated just right, they could end up tarnishing Bush and
Forbes, and inadvertently help another contender, like McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to be very very careful just because of the backlash he
suffered in '96 when he lobbed thermonuclear blasts against Dole,''
said Darrell West, a political science professor at Brown
University who studies campaign advertising. But if Forbes is too
soft, he risks watering down his message, West said, ``and people
can't draw the distinctions between the candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Forbes' poor showings in opinion polls, West said the
publisher should not be written off because ``he's the only one
with the cash _he's the only one who will have financial parity
with Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent focus groups of likely voters in Iowa that were
conducted by the Forbes campaign, viewers were generally responsive
to the commercial in which Forbes mentioned Bush directly.
</P>
<P>
   One woman said, ``The message was, he wants to debate Bush so
you know where people stand. And I want to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   A man put it this way, ``I think everybody wants to hear George
Bush say where he's going.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of the risks facing the Forbes campaign, or any
campaign that contemplates attacking its rivals, one man said the
commercial rubbed him the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it always comes down to this,'' he said. ``But I hate
when they talk about one of the other candidates rather than their
own plan.''

<P>
   MAGUARE, Colombia _ Under U.S. pressure, for most of this decade
the Colombian government has been sending planes to spray
herbicides on the fields of coca that flourish in areas like this.
With a new, more cooperative government in power in Bogota, last
year was a banner year for that joint effort, with a record 135,000
acres fumigated.
</P>
<P>
   But 1998 also turned out to be a record year for cocaine
production in Colombia. By official estimate, acreage devoted to
the cultivation of coca, the plant that provides the raw material
for cocaine, surged more than 25 percent and is now three times
larger than in 1994. Colombia has passed Peru and Bolivia to become
both the largest grower and processor of coca in the world.
</P>
<P>
   All told, at least 180,000 acres are now given over to coca
cultivation, according to a survey made public by Colombia's
Anti-Narcotics Police in September. An additional 14,000 acres are
used for growing heroin poppies, another illicit crop that is
booming despite the U.S.-financed spraying campaign. Such crops
were grown in only 10 of Colombia's 33 provinces five years ago,
but are now cultivated in 21, the survey estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for this continuing surge are many. U.S. officials
say the success of air interdiction efforts in Peru and Bolivia has
forced traffickers to shift cultivation here.
</P>
<P>
   The surge has also coincided with an intensification of
Colombia's decades-old war against leftist guerrillas, with each
fueling the other. The rebels earn money by selling protection to
the growers, who are then free to cultivate still more crops
without fear of interdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia acknowledges that more than three-quarters of all coca
cultivation is concentrated here in the province of Caqueta and
neighboring Putumayo, both strongholds of the country's largest
rebel force, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. The group
operates at will across much of southern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, U.S. and Colombian officials have gradually
come to realize that simple economic logic has propelled the
explosion of coca production as much as the ebb and flow of the
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the Cali and Medellin cartels _ the two
groups that dominated the cocaine trade until their leaders were
arrested or killed in the mid-1990s _ trafficking groups too small
to be regarded as cartels have proliferated. In striving to build
supply networks of their own, they have provided credit to peasant
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a much more decentralized situation with a lot more
actors, well over 100, and that has increased demand,'' said Dr.
Bruce Bagley, a University of Miami professor who is a leading
academic expert on the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have the capital or the equipment to fly coca in
from Peru or Bolivia.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombian trafficking groups have also been experimenting with
more potent varieties of coca, said Col. Jose Leonardo Gallego,
chief of the Anti-Narcotics Police, in an interview while flying
over this rebel-dominated region.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of agronomists hired for the purpose, they have
imported a type of coca native to Peru and grafted it onto the
weaker species traditionally grown here to create a powerful
hybrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you have a variety that can be harvested six to eight
times a year,'' Bagley said. ``So along with the expanded area
under cultivation, you get much greater productivity per plant and
a higher alkaloid content, which means much less cost in refining
and a bigger bang for your buck.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, while the United States and Colombia may agree on
the extent of the coca problem, they often diverge on solutions.
The Colombian government has long had doubts about spraying
campaigns and prefers to focus on crop substitution, but because
the United States insists on spraying _ and is willing to pick up
the costs _ that approach has been emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, fumigation makes no sense,'' said Armando Borrero, a
former national security adviser to the Colombian government,
expressing a view often heard in official circles in Bogota. ``It
only forces the migration of cultivation.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, this area of rolling hills and fertile forest
has been not only a prime region for growing coca but also a
laboratory for efforts to check its spread. Three years ago, coca
growers fought pitched battles with police just south of here in an
attempt to disrupt such efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, though, farmers here seem more willing to shift away
from coca. The National Plan for Alternative Development, a
government agency that seeks to wean peasants from coca to
legitimate crops like coffee and sugar cane, operates a pilot
rubber-producing program here that has attracted dozens of peasant
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a relief not to have the law after me anymore,'' said
Nidia Perdomo, who grew coca for eight years before stopping in
1998. ``You can grow as much rubber as you want, and you don't have
any conflict with the police or the guerrillas.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The farmers' interest in abandoning coca may stem partly from a
growing resentment of the guerrillas, who have been increasingly
unwilling to pay the market price for coca paste as they have
extended their control. At local markets, the guerrillas have
imposed a ceiling of about $410 a pound for paste; elsewhere,
traffickers offer up to $570.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if it was the spraying campaign that made them stop
growing coca, Ms. Perdomo, 41, and her brother Miller, 49, said no.
``The problem with coca is that the profits do not go to those who
grow it,'' she said. ``The intermediaries make all the money while
you are barely surviving.''
</P>
<P>
   Peasants eking out a living from small coca operations, however,
often end up prime targets of the government's fumigation campaign.
In addition, the spraying appears at times to undermine alternative
crop programs based on rubber, palm and fruit trees.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Legitimate farmers commonly complain of being pushed into
poverty after planes mistakenly spray herbicides on fields in which
no coca is growing, or because pilots deliberately dump their
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you spray indiscriminately, as they often do around here,
you kill off the rubber trees as well as the coca plants,'' said
Jesus Bastidas, president of the Caqueta Rubber-Growing and
Reforestation Association.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Carlos Claros Pinzon, the crop substitution agency's
director for Caqueta province, said: ``Spraying works fine with
large-scale commercial cultivation, but when it is aimed at the
smaller producers, it creates a social problem and only makes our
work more difficult. When we show our project to a person who has
been left with absolutely nothing, he says, `That will be fine in a
year, but I am hungry today.'''
</P>
<P>
   Many peasants then simply choose to become ``raspachines,'' or
day laborer hired to tend and harvest coca on large plantations.
Those jobs typically pay $7.50 a day plus meals, twice the going
wage for a worker on a legitimate farm.
</P>
<P>
   Using the slang term for those who run the drug trade, Wenceslao
Villa, operations director for the alternative development agency
founded in 1996, described the problem this way: ``You fumigate,
and the narcos follow behind, offering support and financing'' to
the peasants.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of money has hurt the alternative crop strategy favored
by the Colombian government. Claros learned that firsthand when he
recently visited rebel leaders in San Vicente del Caguan, capital
of the demilitarized zone that the Colombian government handed over
to the rebel group last November. The hope was to get peace talks
started, but the zone is now the focal point of the guerrillas'
drug operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guerrilla commander asked me how much money I can spend in
a year,'' Claros recalled. ``I answered that I have a budget of $4
million and he nearly laughed in my face. To them that is nothing _
what they pay in one weekend at two or three peasant markets to buy
coca paste.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal for U.S. aid to Colombia now before Congress
contains a sizable increase meant for alternative development
programs like the one here. But for the foreseeable future, the
U.S. focus is likely to be on aerial spraying, much to the dismay
of Colombian officials who believe the program inadvertently helps
the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day after, it looks like you dropped napalm, but four
months later it is all flowering again,'' Villa lamented. ``You've
actually done them a favor by cleaning up the lot.''

   NEW YORK _ Kimberly Smith Jensen was known as a tough,
occasionally stubborn, boss around the offices of Mortimer B.
Zuckerman's publishing empire. In August, she had been promoted to
chief operating officer, overseeing three magazines. The
44-year-old executive, whose passion outside the office was rock
and country music, had been with the company for 15 years, playing
a key role in developing the business plan for Fast Company,
Zuckerman's fastest-growing magazine. And she was regarded as a
trustworthy manager.
</P>
<P>
   That is why her undoing is all the more mysterious. On Nov. 4,
Zuckerman and his management asked Ms. Jensen, who oversaw
management at Fast Company, The Atlantic Monthly and U.S. News and
World Report to explain what they said were missing funds under her
authority, says Ira Ellenthal, the chief executive and group
publisher for the magazines. Nine days later, she was found by a
housekeeper in a Comfort Inn in Ocean City, Md., a plastic bag tied
over her head. The police report said Ms. Jensen appeared to have
been dead for at least 24 hours when her body was discovered at
12:45 p.m. on Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Ellenthal said Thomas Peck, the company's chief financial
officer, believed Ms. Jensen had siphoned substantial amounts of
money to cover personal expenses like rent and credit-card bills
and to finance a tour of a rock band she represented.
</P>
<P>
   Ellenthal did not say how much money was involved, but The Wall
Street Journal, which published an article on Friday about Ms.
Jensen's death and the investigation into it, reported that the sum
was in the tens of thousands of dollars. Ms. Jensen's annual salary
was about $250,000, another executive at Zuckerman's company said.
Peck did not return a phone call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jensen was married to Steven Fuchs, a computer specialist
who worked at a ski resort in Killington, Vt. He called the office
on Monday, Nov. 8, saying that his wife had been hospitalized after
a car accident and would not be coming to work. On Nov. 10,
Ellenthal said, Fuchs told her colleagues at work that she had
returned to her home in New York. Fuchs reported her missing to the
police on Nov. 11, two days before her body was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Before her latest promotion, Ms. Jensen had been the general
manager of Fast Company and The Atlantic Monthly, which Zuckerman
sold in September. Both have headquarters in Boston. Ms. Jensen
divided her time between Boston, New York and Killington.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a trusted person and key to The Atlantic long before
she became key to Fast Company,'' Ellenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   William Whitworth, the former editor in chief of The Atlantic
Monthly, said Ms. Jensen had thrived on work and was always
extremely busy. ``I got the impression that she had too much to do,
but sought that,'' Whitworth said. ``She liked running things.''
</P>
<P>
   She also loved rock and country music. Ms. Jensen tried to
advance the careers of a rock band based near her home in
Killington. With her backing, the band, Genghis Angus, did a
10-week cross-country tour in the fall of 1998, playing at venues
from Boston to Chicago to San Francisco to Boulder, Colo.,
according to Guy Burlage, the lead guitarist.
</P>
<P>
   Burlage said Friday, ``In no way shape or form was this any kind
of extravagant tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends said Ms. Jensen and her husband lived on a wooded
two-acre plot near the Killington ski resort, in a home built for
them by a local architect.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Ewald, a local attorney who handled the land sale for the
couple and the owner of a WEBK, a radio station that featured the
kind of artists Ms. Jensen supported, said in an interview Friday:
``She didn't have an extravagant lifestyle. She was a very normal,
down-to-earth person.''
</P>
<P>
   She had recently begun serving as the manager for Jeff Black, a
singer- songwriter who performed in Killington on Nov. 6, two days
after her meeting with Peck. The next day, she drove Black to the
airport in Providence, R.I., according to Louise Coogan, who also
manages musicians and worked with Ms. Jensen in her efforts to find
a label willing to feature Black's work.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jensen ``was working very hard at trying to get him a record
deal,'' Ewald said.
</P>
<P>
   After she dropped Black off at the Providence airport, Ms.
Coogan said, Ms. Jensen drove into the city and attempted suicide
by poisoning herself with the exhaust from her car. According to
the Ocean City police, who investigated her death and confirmed
this account, she was taken to a Providence hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Kitselman, the leader of Genghis Angus, said Friday that
the band was paid through Ms. Jensen's music management companies,
Adrenachrome Records and Straightaway Artist Management. He added
that he found it ``unfathomable'' that she would ever ``skim money
off anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was absolutely the most ethical business person I'd ever
worked with,'' Kitselman said. ``It is totally unfathomable that
she would take money from the magazine'' to support the group.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jensen's husband, Fuchs, did not return phone calls Friday.

<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ A day after President Clinton and other
Western leaders confronted President Boris Yeltsin of Russia at a
meeting in Turkey, condemning his actions in Chechnya, Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas went them one better, calling for an end to
international aid to Moscow unless the Russian government stops
``killing women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot excuse Russian brutality,'' Bush said Friday morning
in the first major foreign policy speech of his campaign for the
Republican presidential nomination. ``When the Russian government
attacks civilians, it can no longer expect aid from international
lending institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the Ronald Reagan Library in the dry hills outside
Simi Valley, a suburb 40 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles,
Bush walked a fine line, balancing tough talk with more moderate
formulations. But he made it clear at the outset that he would hew
to the internationalist principles of his father and fight those in
his own party as well as those outside it who have sought ``to
build a proud tower of protectionism and isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' he said, ``is the shortcut to chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   While the governor implicitly criticized those Republicans who
reject trade agreements with China and turn their backs on the
United Nations, he was more explicit in his criticism of Clinton,
accusing him without citing him by name of allowing the nation ``to
move from crisis to crisis like a cork in a current.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing Clinton's leadership unfavorably to his father, Bush
declared:
</P>
<P>
   ``Alliances are not just for crises, summoned into action when
the fire bell sounds. They are sustained by contact and trust. The
Gulf War coalition, for example, was raised on the foundation of a
president's vision and effort and integrity. Never again should an
American president spend nine days in China, and not even bother to
stop in Tokyo or Seoul or Manila. Never again should an American
president fall silent when China criticizes our security ties to
Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush delivered his 35-minute speech with considerable aplomb,
turning a well-versed, well-drilled performance that on several
occasions rose to presidential level. He quoted Burke and Pericles
and Alexander Solzhenitzyn, and he even echoed a bit of
Churchillian rhetoric when he promised a foreign policy built upon
``idealism, without illusions; confidence, without conceit;
realism, in the service of American ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy seldom plays a central part in American
presidential campaigns. But it can prove decisive if a candidate
gives the impression that the management of the nation's affairs
overseas is beyond his reach.
</P>
<P>
   That happened to Gov. George Romney of Michigan in 1968, when he
said he had been ``brainwashed'' by American officials in Saigon,
and some Bush backers had feared that he faced similar risks. He
had called the Greeks ``Grecians'' and failed to identify important
foreign leaders when given an in-your-face pop quiz by a Boston
television reporter.
</P>
<P>
   His confident performance Friday put such fears to rest for the
moment. But Bush will face a much tougher challenge in a series of
three debates with his Republican rivals, starting in New Hampshire
on Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   They will press him, no doubt, to say more specifically than he
did Friday about what he meant when he asserted that ``American
internationalism should not mean action without vision, activity
without priority, and missions without end _ an approach that
squanders American will and drains American energy.'' Bush argued
that ``unless a president sets his own priorities, his priorities
will be set by others _ by adversaries, or the crisis of the
moment, live on CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   Few would disagree with that. The problem is defining priorities
and criteria for action, which Bush made no real attempt to do. A
president, he said simply, should extend the peace, build a united
Western Hemisphere linked by free trade, seek Middle East peace,
check the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and do it with
``patience, wisdom and strength.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Robert Blackwill, a lecturer at the John F. Kennedy School of
government at Harvard University, who worked on the National
Security Council in the Bush administration, said that the governor
had concentrated heavily Friday on Russia and China because those
nations, ``not Haiti, not Somalia,'' impinged directly upon the
national interests of the United States. In fact, Bush made no
mention at all of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwill is a member of a small group counseling Bush on
foreign policy matters. It also includes Condoleezza Rice of
Stanford University, Paul Wolfowitz of Johns Hopkins University,
Robert Zoellick of Harvard, the German Marshall Fund of the United
States and Goldman, Sachs; and Richard Perle of the American
Enterprise Institute. All have served in past Republican
administrations, and several were with Bush Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two of Eurasia's greatest powers, China and Russia, are powers
in transition, and it is difficult to know their intentions when
they do not know their own futures,'' Bush told a largely invited
audience of about 400 people here. ``If they become America's
friends, that friendship will steady the world. But if not, the
peace we seek may not be found.''
</P>
<P>
   Consistency was one of Bush's main themes, especially on China.
Again without naming Clinton, he said the administration had called
the Chinese leadership ``the butchers of Beijing'' one year and
embraced the Chinese leadership as a ``strategic partner'' only a
few years later.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the governor said, he would stand up to China if
it threatened democratic nations in its region, such as Taiwan and
South Korea. He promised again to help Taiwan defend itself. And he
welcomed the idea of Chinese entry into the World Trade
Organization, while warning that ``it will take a strong
administration to hold them to their word,'' given what he termed
``China's poor record'' in honoring international agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must deal with China without ill-will, but without
illusions,'' Bush said in one of his many this-and-that statements.
China ``will be unthreatened, but not unchecked,'' he added a few
moments later.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced as ``a person who thinks for himself'' by former
Secretary of State George Shultz, who is an unofficial member of
the Bush brain trust, Bush spoke in a yearlong forum series
sponsored by the Reagan Library. Former first lady Nancy Reagan was
in the audience, as she was when Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
Bush's leading Republican rival, spoke here in September.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had many reasons to choose the Reagan Library as the venue
for his speech. California has more delegates to the Republican
convention than any other state, and Reagan went directly from two
terms as governor to the presidency without any previous Washington
experience, just as Bush is attempting to do.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Rice said, Bush wanted to contrast Reagan with
Clinton, especially with regard to the Californian's ``strength,
leadership and choosing a few goals, a few regions and
concentrating our national resources on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush won his loudest applause when he took a tough, Reaganesque
line in defense of what he called ``America's interests, America's
obligations and America's honor,'' and when he obliquely criticized
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to develop and deploy both theater and national
missile defense systems, and he ripped into the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty that the Senate recently rejected. The treaty, he said,
``does not stop proliferation, especially by renegade regimes by a
wide margin. It is not verifiable. It is not enforceable. And it
would stop us from ensuring the safety and reliability of our
nation's deterrent, should the need arise.''
</P>
<P>
   On the United Nations, he was again even-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never place U.S. troops under U.N. command, but the
U.N. can help in peacekeeping and unitarian efforts,'' Bush
declared to warm applause at one point. ``If I am elected
president, America will pay its dues, but only if the U.N.'s
bureaucracy is reformed and our disproportionate share of its costs
is reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   There was even a slight bow to the French and their argument
that the American formula is not a one-size-fits-all model for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We value the elegant structures of our own democracy, ``the
governor said, ``but realize that, in other societies, the
architecture will vary. We propose our principles but we must not
impose our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush pre-sold his speech in telephone calls to columnists and
reporters in recent days, and his potential opponents, such as Vice
President Al Gore, had their aides calling to comment on it before
it had even been delivered. Clearly it was a big event in the
unfolding campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was put in a difficult position by Bush's call for an end
to international aid to Chechnya. Gore is closely associated with
the Russians, and he supported the administration when it held up
aid to Indonesia when its soldiers were killing people in East
Timor. It will be hard to argue that what the Russians are doing in
Chechnya is different.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing Republican criticism, the administration is reassessing
whether to announce a major resumption of American aid to Russia in
the next week or so, in the form of a half-billion dollars in loans
by the Export-Import Bank.

 &HT;    Amid mourning, a surge of undefinable spirit survives
 &HT;    By Bill Bishop
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ ``Howdy,'' Will Hurd said when he
stepped in front of the microphones at a news conference Thursday
afternoon. Automatically, instinctively, the hundreds of young
people standing near the place where 11 died in a collapse of heavy
logs answered their student body president in unison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howdy.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditions aren't things you think about. They are just there,
naturally. They fit, go together like butter on bread or salt on
meat. A tradition on the Texas A&AMP;M University campus is for
students to greet each other with a friendly ``howdy'' in passing.
When Will Hurd stood to address a thick nest of television cameras
in the most difficult of circumstances, he fell back on the hard
ground of A&AMP;M traditions. He howdied. And the students howdied
back.
</P>
<P>
   An accounting of A&AMP;M's traditions is an inadequate way to
explain Aggieland. It is certainly no way to understand the grief,
the incredible depth of collective mourning taking place in the
town and on the campus. There is celebration of football at A&AMP;M,
respect for the dead and love for the university. The three came
together this week in a twisted stack of logs.
</P>
<P>
   Bonfire is the culmination of A&AMP;M's obsession with football.
``It's almost a religion,'' said Kathy Schiflett, a sociologist and
1985 A&AMP;M graduate. ``And the bonfire is the crescendo. It's the
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The connection between living Aggies and those who have passed
on is renewed in the more subdued ceremonies of Muster and Silver
Taps. Once a year, on April 21, San Jacinto Day, Aggies gather to
read the names of A&AMP;M students and graduates who have died since
the last Muster. Silver Taps takes place on campus and also pays
respect to the dead. Once a month, lights are doused at the
Administration Building in the evening. People stand by the
flagpole. Members of the Corps of Cadets fire three seven-gun
volleys, and trumpeters play taps three times.
</P>
<P>
   J.B. ``Dick'' Hervey, class president in 1942 and former
executive director of the Association of Former Students, said
these rituals have two purposes. They ``honor the Aggies that have
died,'' Hervey explained. ``And we renew our love and affection for
our institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, an A&AMP;M graduate, told those attending a
memorial service Thursday night that the 11 who died will be
remembered ``as long as the Aggie spirit is alive, and that, my
friends, is forever.'' The feeling here is that A&AMP;M's traditions
have, indeed, been around forever. They began, however, early this
century and distinctly changed the way of life that then existed on
the A&AMP;M campus.
</P>
<P>
   In his two-volume history of A&AMP;M, Henry C. Dethloff wrote that
the World War I era ``witnessed a distinct change in student
attitudes at A&AMP;M.'' Sam A. McMillan, a student and later a
professor at A&AMP;M, according to Dethloff, noted that a football
``hysteria'' developed, and literary societies ``folded their wings
`for the long sleep.'''
</P>
<P>
   ```College spirit' and indoctrination surpassed and even began
to smother academic interests,'' Dethloff wrote. ``Extra work in
the labs and voluntary reading in the library became too
'sissified' for the 'Ruff-Tuff, Real-Stuff' A&AMP;M man.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the beginning of the ``Aggie spirit'' that has
maintained itself even as the academic life at A&AMP;M has regained its
footing. Living students and alumni are tied to those who have died
and to the university, and it's all reinforced and maintained by
traditions and rituals that have become such a part of life that
they are rarely reflected upon or examined. In a sense, that
introspection is impossible; it's almost inconceivable to examine a
way of life so deeply internalized.
</P>
<P>
   The French sociologist Emile Durkheim described the power of a
society's ``collective consciousness.'' Society, Durkheim believed,
``has to be present within the individual.'' People needed shared
values and so societies adopted sacred symbols that united them
``in one single moral community.''
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't have to follow Durkheim completely to see the
workings of a ``collective consciousness'' on the A&AMP;M campus. In
1921, E. King Gill, a former fullback, was called from the stands
to suit up. A tough game with the ``Praying Colonels'' of
Kentucky's Centre College had depleted A&AMP;M's reserves, and Gill
became the ``12th Man,'' the ever-eager Aggie student willing to
enter the game. Since that game, Aggie students have stoodduring
games, ready to be the next 12th Man called from the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Gill later wrote that ``love for A&AMP;M is not born outside; it is
born within its walls. You must love it and have it to touch to
your heart.'' The traditions at A&AMP;M don't end with graduation, or
even with death. ``Aggie spirit'' doesn't need a definition. It
simply exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that there will be a unanimous feeling that it's
now time to do away with the bonfire and go in a different
direction,'' Hervey said, sitting in a room filled with A&AMP;M
memorabilia. ``It's such a waste of effort and so dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   But wouldn't that break the link, sever the ties among the
members of the A&AMP;M community?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the spirit will remain just as active as ever,''
Hervey answered. ``There will be midnight yell practice and band
playing. Just without the fire.''

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The ousted prime minister of Pakistan, Nawaz
Sharif, appeared in public Friday for the first time in five weeks
and told a judge that he was not guilty of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing haggard, Sharif, who reportedly complained that he had
been kept in solitary confinement by the new military government,
was taken into a courthouse in Karachi by a knot of heavily armed
paramilitary troops. He had been taken through the streets in an
armored personnel carrier as part of a long caravan.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was a hearing in an anti-terrorist court, a site
that he had introduced to administer speedy justice to criminals
against the state.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings were brief, and Judge Rehmat Hussain Jafri
returned Sharif to custody, giving prosecutors until next Friday to
present official charges that would let a trial begin. According to
a complaint filed last week, Sharif is accused of hijacking,
kidnapping and conspiracy to murder for having ordered air-traffic
controllers to bar the landing of a plane that was carrying the
army chief of staff. Sharif could face the death penalty if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not conspire in a hijacking,'' he was quoted as having
said. ``Hijacking is done at gunpoint. In this case, the whole
democratic process has been hijacked.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the army chief who ousted Sharif and is
has declared himself Pakistan's chief executive, pledged that the
case would be tried in a ``fair and transparent'' way. But the
press was denied access to the courtroom. Guards beat up some
journalists, and others were threatened with weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's statements in court were recounted after the hearing by
his lawyers and others who had been inside. The lawyers had not
been permitted to see their client beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening today, has the trial started?'' Sharif
asked, according to a lawyer, Nihal Hashmi.
</P>
<P>
   Another lawyer, Iqbal Radh, said he had repeated to the judge
statements that Sharif had told him. ``I was kept in a small room
in Rawalpindi in solitary confinement,'' Radh quoted Sharif as
having complained. ``Some gentlemen came to me and questioned me. I
stayed in Rawalpindi and then was shifted to Murree in cold weather
and remained there in a small room without any facilities. I could
not read newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rawalpindi, next to the capital, Islamabad, is the home of the
army headquarters. Murree is a nearby hill station.
</P>
<P>
   Another observer quoted Sharif as having said, ``They did not
torture me physically, but they did everything else.'' Asked
whether he expected a fair trial, Sharif reportedly answered,
``Time will tell if I get justice or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, a millionaire industrialist often accused of corruption,
was removed from power by the military Oct. 12, hours after he had
dismissed his hand-picked army commander, Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint against Sharif, filed Nov. 10 by an army officer,
tells an account that by now is well known to virtually all of
Pakistan's 150 million people. Unaware that he had been ousted,
Musharraf was returning to Pakistan from Sri Lanka on a commercial
flight. Air-traffic controllers, reportedly under Sharif's orders,
refused to allow the plane to land as scheduled in Karachi.
Vehicles blocked the landing strips. Runway lights were turned off.
The airliner, nearly out of fuel, was finally able to land only
after army officers loyal to Musharraf had seized the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The rules in the anti-terrorist courts are made for speed. With
some exceptions, trials are limited to seven days. They can begin
almost immediately after official charges have been filed,
sometimes simultaneously with the questioning of witnesses by
investigators.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sharif, who became prime minister for the second time in
February 1997, frequently made an issue of the need for quicker
justice. Last year, he even let military judges try civilians, a
move that the Supreme Court eventually declared illegal, although
after several of the accused civilians had been swiftly executed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, such fleet proceedings would seem to be working against
Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole case is phony and baseless and one sided, and it
will come apart if a proper defense is allowed to be provided,''
said Raja Zafar-ul-Haq, who was Sharif's religion minister. ``But
these are strange times in Pakistan.''

<P>
   When Charles E. Knox was terminated from his job in middle
management at Microsoft in 1995, he sued the company, accusing it
of breaching his employment contract. He asked for not only the
usual lost salary, but also the worth of his options. A court
awarded him $650,000 but denied him the value of any options.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, a Washington state appeals court agreed with
Knox's larger claim, ruling that he was entitled to more than just
the salary he had left behind. It said Knox, who had spent more
than 10 years at Microsoft, could also claim the value of the stock
options he lost when he left. His lawyers contend that those
options are worth tens of millions of dollars, an estimate
Microsoft disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Knox is not alone among fired American workers. Employment
lawyers say a growing number of workers who feel that they have
been discriminated against or wrongfully fired are seeking redress
not just for lost wages but also for the value of lost stock
options. The stakes in employment-related lawsuits are rising
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   These claims pose a particular risk for technology companies.
Many of them grant their employees stock options in lieu of large
paychecks and have seen the value of their shares soar.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that the value of options in such cases is
rising,'' said Frank D. Tinari, an economics professor at Seton
Hall University in South Orange, N.J. Tinari is often called into
employment cases to put a price tag on damages. He estimates that
about one-tenth of the 120 employment lawsuits where he has
provided analysis in the last two and a half years have involved
claims for stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Options typically grant the right to buy stock at a fixed price
for a fixed period of time, no matter how high (or low) the shares
go. A portion of them usually vest, or become effective, in each of
several years after they are granted.
</P>
<P>
   Knox said he was forced to exercise options, then had to sell
25,000 of those shares to pay his exercise costs and related
expenses. He said he also had to give up 17,000 options that had
not yet vested. Had he been able to keep all of his options, he
said, he would now have 360,000, thanks to subsequent stock splits.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry R. McNaul, a Seattle lawyer who is representing Knox, said
an economist recently valued the lost options at $25 million to $70
million, with the larger number reflecting their possible value if
they were held until their latest expiration date, 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stock options were a major incentive for coming to
Microsoft,'' Knox said. ``They far outshadowed salary and other
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft case is scheduled for a hearing in January. In
court papers, Microsoft said Knox was working under a contract that
permitted his dismissal at any time. A Microsoft spokesman said the
company also contests Knox's valuation of his options. ``There is a
universally recognized method for valuing stock options, and based
on that, we think that the value of his options is significantly
less than what he is claiming,'' said the spokesman, Dan Leach.
</P>
<P>
   McNaul has represented about a dozen former Microsoft employees
who have tried to recover the value of lost options. Most of those
cases, he said, were settled out of court, with provisions
requiring that the outcomes be kept confidential. But, he said, in
each case, ``the principal damage claim was the loss of stock
options.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a claim was also made by Nina Bronk Kellner, a former
manager involved in business development and strategy at America
Online. Last December, Ms. Bronk Kellner filed a claim with the
federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, accusing AOL of
wrongful termination and discriminating against her both because of
her pregnancy and her gender.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bronk Kellner joined AOL in 1995, when, she said, the
company was an underdog in the race to attract online subscribers.
She said she had enough faith in the company's prospects to accept
a salary that was low by industry standards, but which was
accompanied by an attractive options package.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bronk Kellner said that she was forced to exercise her
options when she lost her job in June 1998 and that she also had to
give up options that had not vested.
</P>
<P>
   She said that since she lost her job, AOL's stock price has
quintupled. Debra S. Katz, a Washington lawyer representing Ms.
Bronk Kellner, says her client's lost options are now worth $34
million.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Bronk Kellner put it, ``I took a huge bet with this
company, whose stock could just as easily have gone down. I feel
like I lost a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas J. Graham, a spokesman for America Online, said the
company had no comment on the claim's specifics. But, he added,
``We are confident that we are fully justified in our employment
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers say companies and employees often appear willing to
settle out of court rather than to try a case in a developing area
of law _ and the courts are still trying to decide how to
compensate employees for lost options. ``These are clearly
high-risk cases,'' said Lewis M. Steel, a Manhattan employment
discrimination lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Lucas, a lawyer specializing in wrongful-discharge law in
West Orange, N.J., said that while companies are generally willing
to grant former employees roughly three-quarters of the value of
options that might have vested during the year they were fired,
they rarely offer compensation for options that would vest later.
The law is unclear on whether employees can recover options that
have yet to vest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not even clear how these options should be valued. The
formula commonly used by investors and compensation experts is more
reliable for companies whose shares have long histories than for
companies that have only recently gone public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these types of cases are going to create a cottage
industry of experts for projecting what these options will be
worth,'' Ms. Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the employment lawyers said the courts have generally
supported the right of wrongfully fired employees to recover the
value of lost, vested stock options. Ms. Katz said the courts have
also decided that, because options represent pay already received,
claims for them should not be subject to the limits that the
federal Civil Rights Act puts on compensatory damages in employment
discrimination suits. These limits range from $50,000 to $300,000,
depending on the size of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, employees seeking to recover the value of options
scored a victory when a New Jersey state superior court decided to
compensate a fired employee even for options he would have received
in future years. The court, in Morristown, awarded Alfred
Jablonski, a former lawyer for American Home Products, about $1.6
million both for lost earnings and stock options. Jablonski
contended that he had been wrongfully dismissed when he turned 65.
</P>
<P>
   Tinari was called into the American Home Products case by
Jablonski's lawyers to determine how much he was entitled to
collect. He calculated that Jablonski deserved not just $765,000 in
lost salary and bonuses, but also more than $1 million in lost
options, including options he would have received had he worked
until he was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey court did not say how much of the award was for
Jablonski's options only. Lowell Weiner, a spokesman for the
company, refused to comment on the specifics of Jablonski's
options. But he said that the company believes that the
discrimination claim is without merit and that it is appealing the
decision.

<P>
   Pfizer will not get its chance to block the proposed $69-billion
merger of Warner-Lambert and American Home Products until January,
William C. Steere Jr., Pfizer's chairman, told pharmaceutical
analysts in a meeting on Tuesday that he had hoped the Delaware
Chancery Court would make its ruling within four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer filed a lawsuit two weeks ago when it made a
$72.4-billion hostile bid to acquire Warner-Lambert. Pfizer has
accused Warner-Lambert executives of using unfair tactics,
including a $2-billion breakup fee, to derail Pfizer's acquisition
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware Chancery Court will hold a preliminary hearing on
Pfizer's charges on Jan. 24. Pfizer, American Home Products and
Warner-Lambert said in statements Friday that they considered the
accelerated hearing date a development in their favor. But
investors may have a long wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the court makes its ruling, Pfizer won't raise its
bid,'' said Sergio Traversa, an analyst with Mehta Partners. ``What
we have now is a two-month stall. Investors won't know what to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer's shares increased 6.25 cents Friday, to close at $33.75.
Warner-Lambert's shares fell 81.25 cents, to close at $87.625.
American Home Products' stock increased $1.50, to close at $54.

MEDIATOR IS NAMED TO SEEK MICROSOFT SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Iowa, Conn.)  (subs to insert new material, after 4th graf, on Posner's
writings) 
(bl) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal judge overseeing the Microsoft
antitrust trial named a mediator Friday in an effort to bring about
settlement talks between Microsoft Corp. and its accusers: the
Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative was wholly that of the judge, Thomas Penfield
Jackson, but all sides said they welcomed the move.
</P>
<P>
   No settlement talks had been planned before he surprised the
Microsoft and government legal teams during a conference in his
chambers Thursday by announcing that he planned to name as mediator
Richard Posner, the chief judge for the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals, in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In his order, published Friday, Jackson said that mediation
would be voluntary and nonbinding, and that it was up to Posner,
``acting in a private capacity,'' to schedule any talks. None were
immediately set.
</P>
<P>
   Posner has written widely and provocatively on diverse topics,
notably antitrust law, on which he has shown a libertarian,
free-market bent.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also said the schedule for the trial, which calls for a
verdict as early as February, was not being altered, meaning the
two sides may have as much as 90 days to reach a settlement.
Judging from their public statements, they remain far apart.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's findings of fact in the case, published Nov. 5, were
so heavily weighted against Microsoft that they seemed to leave
little room for settlement negotiations. In the findings, Jackson
found that Microsoft used its monopoly power to threaten and bully
allies and competitors alike, stifling innovation and competition
in the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Friday evening, the Justice Department
said: ``Judge Posner is a highly respected jurist. We look forward
to meeting with him to discuss the severe competitive problems
identified in the court's findings of fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, speaking for all of the states
involved, said: ``We welcome the judge's order. We always have
believed in the mediation process.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft welcomed the news, too, with a different spin. ``We
look forward to working with Judge Posner to find a solution that
is fair to Microsoft, fair to consumers and good for the future of
the high-tech industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's announcement, which was made after the markets closed,
sent Microsoft's stock up sharply. It ended the trading day at $86
but rose as high as $90.97 in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Posner comes to the case with no real power beyond the strength
of his reputation and the need of both sides to show Jackson that
they are being responsive to his initiative. He has no authority to
force the parties to reach a settlement, or to impose one.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers from both sides of the case, and others, describe
Posner as a brilliant jurist, among the most respected in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Fischel, dean of the University of Chicago Law School,
where Posner teaches, calls him ``the single greatest antitrust
scholar and judge of this generation.''
</P>
<P>
   President Ronald Reagan appointed Posner to the court in 1981.
At the time, he taught law at the University of Chicago _ and still
does, part time. He is also the author of more than 30 books as
well as numerous articles in the scholarly and popular press. His
most recent book, ``An Affair of State,'' published in September,
was about the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So Posner is accustomed to working mornings and weekends, which
Jackson is now asking him to do for this case. Though he has
offered no opinions on the Microsoft case, he has written
extensively about antitrust and once offered the opinion, in a law
review article, that the AT&AMP;T case in the early 1980s was brought
``to a triumphant conclusion'' by the breakup of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The 7th Circuit also has an active mediation program, noted one
lawyer involved in this case, and one rule prevailing there is that
the mediator does not tell the district court judge trying the case
what occurred during the talks. That way, if the talks fail because
of one party or another, it will not prejudice the judge as he
prepares his verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with that background, coaxing the parties to agree
in this case is a leviathan task. Though both sides say they are
open to mediation, the plaintiffs are flush with confidence from
Jackson's findings, and they are calling for a strong remedy. While
Microsoft has said it is open to settlement discussions, it has
essentially ruled out most everything the plaintiffs have said they
are likely to propose.
</P>
<P>
   The last serious settlement negotiations were held in May 1998,
just before the antitrust suits were filed. At that time Microsoft
offered concessions that now seem mild. The company told the
government that to address a complaint from personal-computer
makers, it would allow them to customize the opening screen of
Windows, Microsoft's dominant operating system. But when pressed by
the government a day later, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates said the
company was not willing to consider even that.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, urged on by Jackson, the litigants have held two or
three lackluster meetings, most recently last summer, and none of
these talks has seemed to go any where. Presiding for Microsoft at
those sessions was William Neukom, Microsoft's chief counsel, along
with several lawyers from Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, the firm that
represented Microsoft in court.
</P>
<P>
   For the government, Joel Klein, the head of the Justice
Department's antitrust division presided, accompanied by several
other Justice Department lawyers including David Boies, the lead
lawyer in court, and one or more state attorneys general. The
lineup is likely to be the same for any new talks.
</P>
<P>
   Since the publication of Jackson's findings, the Justice
Department and the states have agreed that any remedy or settlement
must deal in some way with Microsoft's monopoly in personal
computer operating systems _ though no agreement has been reached
in how that would be done.
</P>
<P>
   Under the mildest proposals being discussed, rules would be
enacted that would change Microsoft's behavior while allowing the
company to keep its present structure. Stronger solutions under
discussion, which Microsoft said it would vehemently oppose,
include forcing Microsoft to publish or auction the source code for
Windows _ so other companies could create competing operating
systems _ or breaking up the company.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Time magazine last week, Gates also said he
would not agree to any settlement that deprived Microsoft of the
ability to add anything it wants to Windows or that allowed
computer makers to alter Windows without Microsoft's permission.
</P>
<P>
   Several state attorneys general have said they would be willing
to agree only to one of the stronger remedies, and no settlement is
possible without agreement from the attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who attended
the meeting with Jackson Thursday, and who will likely be a part of
the settlement negotiations, said he was encouraged that the trial
schedule ``will remain in effect'' through the settlement talks
``so there will be no delays.''

   1) BILL NUMBER: AGRI-BIZ
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected, 27-71, an amendment to impose
a moratorium on mergers and aquisitions between food and
agricululture companies. Supporters said the amendment, attached to
a bankruptcy reform bill, addresses the problem of market
concentration in the agricultural sector that is edging out family
farmers. Opponents said the bill overly restricts large
agribusiness companies. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: COAL
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 56 to 33, an amendment to allow
mountain coal mining operations to continue dumping waste into
rivers and streams for two more years. Supporters said the measure,
attached to a spending bill, would help mining companies. Opponents
said the measure would undermine existing environmental
protections. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.

   The House on Thursday approved, 296 to 135, a final catch-all
spending bill that provides more funds for education and health
programs, restores $12 billion of previously cut funds to Medicare
and provides funds for the U.S. to repay debts to the United
Nations. The consolidated spending bill also gives $435.8 million
to the District of Columbia, and includes a plan to allow satellite
companies to provide local broadcast service to customers.
Supporters said the bill gives more money to key programs without
dipping into the Social Security surplus. Opponents said the $385
billion represents bad budgeting practices by including too many
last-minute provisions. They were also concerned that most members
did not have time to read the 2000-page document before voting. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.

   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ The signs in this rural college town
read ``Aggieland,'' but for the faithful of Texas A&AMP;M University,
the expression is less a point on a map than a state of mind. Ask
someone to explain the fierce devotion of alumni, or the school's
arcane traditions, and the answer is often a smile or a shake of
the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the outside looking in, you can't understand it,'' said
Ian Hastings, 27, a 1995 graduate, repeating a familiar phrase.
``From the inside looking out, you can't explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase is particularly apt after a campus accident on
Thursday, in which 11 students were killed while building a huge
wooden structure for a traditional Thanksgiving Day football
bonfire. To outsiders looking in, the image of scores of students
clambering atop a 40-foot tower of logs in the early morning hours
with limited university oversight might seem unduly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   But to Aggies, as students and alumni are known, the bonfire is
a 90-year tradition that binds generations of students to one
another and to the university. Students aspire to become Red Pots
or Brown Pots, the upperclassmen who oversee the round-the-clock
construction effort. The state's lieutenant governor, Rick Perry,
and the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Henry
Cisneros, both hoisted logs in their undergraduate days. Recent
graduates often return to help out during the final week, known as
Push.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been said several times that once you're a part of A&AMP;M,
you have maroon blood,'' John Hoyle, a professor of educational
administration who has written about the university's lore, said of
the school's colors. ``You're a member of the long maroon line.''
</P>
<P>
   With the last body removed from the wreckage early Friday
morning, university officials pledged a full investigation into the
accident. A federal investigator with the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration arrived Friday. And even though the cause of
the accident had not yet been determined, the university police
announced that they would not conduct a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be an engineering determination,'' said Bob Wiatt,
public safety director for the university. ``There is no negligence
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood across campus Friday was somber as students wore white
and maroon ribbons or carried carnations and roses. Seven of the 28
students injured in the accident remained hospitalized, including
four in intensive care. The hundreds of onlookers who stood vigil
for hours during the long rescue effort on Thursday had mostly
dispersed Friday, though some tearful students prayed or simply
stared at the cleared stacks of logs.
</P>
<P>
   University officials canceled this year's bonfire, which marks
the school's biggest football game against its rival, the
University of Texas. The football game is still scheduled for next
Friday at Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   The internal investigation is expected to examine the future of
the bonfire and whether changes are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the accident told rescuers they heard a loud pop or
crack just before the accident on Thursday, and officials are
expected to investigate whether the structure's 55-foot central
guide pole _ made of two huge pieces of wood joined by bolts and
heavy cable _ snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Lawson, a university spokeswoman, said officials would
first focus on consoling and healing the ``Aggie family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do is get to the bottom of what happened, and
make some decision based on that,'' Ms. Lawson said. ``To say if
we're going to change bonfire is probably premature at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Within Texas, where school rivalries are fierce, Texas A&AMP;M is
known for its almost religious adherence to traditions, some of
which are nearly a century old. For some, the gold class ring
awarded to seniors is worn for life, and Hoyle said the
indoctrination begins for with Fish Camp, where literally thousands
of incoming freshman attend a summer camp ``to learn the rituals,
the yells, to develop the friendships for life.''
</P>
<P>
   The most enthusiastic guardians of the rituals are the school's
2,000 member Corps of Cadets, a quasimilitary cadre who shave their
heads and wear uniforms to class. The most revered tradition is
Silver Taps, or Muster, the service held on the first Tuesday of
every month if a student has died during the month. Every year on
April 21, the anniversary of the battle of San Jacinto, the battle
in which Texas defeated Mexico to become a republic, alumni across
the world hold Muster to remember fallen Aggies. Last year,
officials said, alumni in 112 countries conducted the ritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent two years in Afghanistan running a medical school,''
recalled Dr. James H. ``Red'' Duke, a prominent alumnus who is
medical director of LifeFlight, the second oldest helicopter
medical program in the country. ``I had hepatitis in March of '71.
The first time I left the house I drove 90 miles to Aggie Muster in
Kabul on April 21st. There were nine Texas Aggies and nine Afghan
Aggies.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this same passion that permeates the tradition of Bonfire,
which first occurred in 1909 and until 1936 was fueled with stolen
desks, chairs and other items. Hastings, the 1995 graduate, said
his telephone rang in Dallas on Thursday morning within an hour of
the 2:28 a.m. accident and that he had arrived within five hours to
help with the rescue effort. ``My roommate said I had 47 messages
by nine in the morning,'' said Hastings, who served as a Brown Pot
while an undergraduate. ``My cell phone rang 100 times on the way
here. It's a big family.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Link, a fifth-year senior, said about 21 upperclassmen
serve as coordinators each year for harvesting trees and then
construction, 16 of whom are called Red Pots, the highest ranking,
and another five are Brown Pots. The nicknames are for the colors
of hats worn by coordinators during the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The colors are visual aids,'' said Link, a former Red Pot who
wore a T-shirt from the 1997 bonfire that read, ``Remember the
Tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got a lot of people working in a crowd, you need
to be able to stand out.''
</P>
<P>
   Link said that upperclassmen select new coordinators each year
and hand down instructions on how to build the 55-foot tiered
structure. There have been assorted minor injuries through the
years, and the structure collapsed in 1994 after heavy rains, but
no one was hurt. Link said the coordinators hold training courses
for the harvest and the construction process, and that different
work crews are scheduled 24 hours a day during Push week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a class that will teach them more than anything they
can learn on campus as far as people skills and work ethic,'' Link
said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But university officials, who sanction the event, say they have
exerted more oversight in recent years. A university liaison to the
project, Rusty Thompson, advises the students and officials said he
provides daily oversight. But though Thompson visited the tower
hours before the accident, detecting no problems, he was not
present when the accident occurred. Wiatt said a university police
officer was at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every student must go through a safety training program before
participating in bonfire,'' said Lane Stephenson, deputy director
of university relations. ``Safety has always been of paramount
importance, even though it is recognized that there are some
inherent risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, officials began a crackdown on alcohol use during
the project after occasional reports of drunkenness. Shannon Ensom,
21, a senior from Coppell, Tex., who served on an bonfire advisory
committee this year, said hundreds of students signed cards
pledging not to drink. The theme was, ``Don't Let Alcohol Shatter
the Tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to show everybody that that wasn't what bonfire is
about,'' she said. Stephenson said officials had heard no reports
of alcohol being involved in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether the university will exert even
greater control over the bonfire, or even cancel it, as the
University of Texas did years ago with a similar event. In a
response to a query delivered by e-mail, Cisneros spoke of the
``great esprit de corps'' and lessons of teamwork provided by the
bonfire. But the accident, he said, also made him realize the
inherent danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very graphic for me because I worked on that bonfire and
it's a huge project and just the weight of those logs and the scale
of it drives home how utterly dangerous it is when something goes
wrong,'' he said in a response left on an answering machine. ``I
guess it was always dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke, whose first bonfire came during his freshman year in 1946,
said the faithful of Aggieland ``can't redo this event but we can
learn from it. We always learn more when things are tough than when
they're going well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd give anything in the world for it not to have happened,''
he added. ``I think we have to go and figure out what's wrong,
correct it and proceed.''

 Starbucks to Buy San Francisco Entertainment Retailer  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Coffee giant Starbucks Corp. has purchased Hear Music, an upscale
music retailer that until recently was based in San Francisco, for
under $10 million.
<P>
   Starbucks has sold jazz CDs in its coffee shops for several
years and considers music an important part of how customers
experience its brand, said Bonnie Kramer Tonneson, an analyst with
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a minor acquisition (for Starbucks), but it is a first
step toward fortifying the whole in-store and online experience,''
said Tonneson.
</P>
<P>
   The deal closed in mid-October and Hear's staff has already
moved to Starbucks' offices in Seattle, said Don MacKinnon, Hear's
former chief executive, in a telephone interview yesterday.
MacKinnon's new title is vice president, music and entertainment,
for Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   Hear Music stores are unusual in that they focus on educating
shoppers about music and introducing them to new artists. Listening
stations are arranged thematically; shoppers are allowed to unwrap
and listen to any CD in the store.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  MacKinnon told The Chronicle in September that he intended to
roll out 75 to 100 Hear Music stores across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday, he said plans for new non-Starbucks locations are
on hold, although the five existing locations _ in Berkeley, San
Francisco, Palo Alto, Santa Monica and Chicago _ will remain open.
</P>
<P>
   Partnering with Starbucks was Hear's best option for going
national, MacKinnon said. It's the best place to find Hear's
upscale customer ``in the right mood, in great numbers and at a
time when they sort of taking a pause in their day.''
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks did not release terms of the deal other than to say
that it spent less than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts Thursday, Starbucks chief
executive Howard Schultz disclosed plans to install listening
stations in some Starbucks cafes, according to Andrew Barish, an
analyst with Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   The kiosks will likely connect to a Hear Music Intranet that
contains music reviews and recommendations. The Intranet is
currently  &LR; used in a new Hear prototype store in San Francisco's
Metreon shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   MacKinnon said no decision has been made about how many stores
will include kiosks. ``There will be different solutions in
different stores,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, 800 of Starbucks' 2,500 stores installed fixtures
holding branded Starbucks CDs, plus other selections chosen by the
Hear team, such as the popular Buena Vista Social Club.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, MacKinnon and his staff will produce all of
Starbucks' CDs. Music accounts for less than 1 percent of total
Starbucks sales, Tonneson said.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks has installed a link from its home page,
www.starbucks.com, to Hear Music's site, www.hearmusic.com.
Starbucks is also promoting links with two other new Web partners,
Cooking.com and Geerlings &AMP; Wade, a mail-order wine retailer.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Starbucks announced an ambitious strategy of
creating a ``lifestyle portal'' of upscale brands on the Web. It
formed partnerships with several Web content providers and
attempted to buy Williams-Sonoma Inc., which spurned the offer.
</P>
<P>
   But investors frowned on that strategy, sending Starbucks' stock
plummeting. Since then, Starbucks has scaled back those plans.
``Instead of an all-consuming focus for Howard Schultz it's more of
a sidebar,'' Tonneson said.
</P>
<P>
   Hear Music, which was privately held, generated revenues of
between $5 million and $10 million in 1998. It was founded by
MacKinnon and two partners in Cambridge, Mass., in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Hear was sold in 1992 to CML Group, which undertook an
unsuccessful rollout. MacKinnon and a partner bought it back from
CML for $371,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its five U.S. stores and the Starbucks deal, Hear
licenses its name and format to Chapters, a Canadian superstore
chain, which runs 12 in-store music shops under the Hear name.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Staff at ZDTV Elated to Swap Ziff for Vulcan  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
ZDTV, the all-computers-all-the-time cable channel, was sold by
publisher Ziff-Davis to billionaire Paul Allen yesterday for nearly
$205 million.
<P>
   The sale comes amid a jettisoning of assets by Ziff after
following  &LR; a mandate from its Japanese parent company, Softbank, to
focus almost exclusively on Internet-related properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we know the end of the movie,'' ZDTV's chief executive,
Larry Wangberg, told a gathering of about 250 staff members at the
channel's San Francisco headquarters yesterday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The staffers toasted the news of their acquisition with
champagne.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ecstatic,'' one ZDTV insider said of the buyout. ``Ziff
is a magazine publisher. They don't know about about TV. Paul Allen
gets what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen's Vulcan Ventures had invested $54 million for a 33
percent stake in ZDTV earlier this year. Yesterday's deal involved
Ziff's 64 percent majority holding in the channel.
</P>
<P>
   ZDTV features programs about computers, information technology
and the Internet. Viewers can interact with the channel via a
related Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sale to Vulcan, ZDTV will maintain a content-sharing
relationship with Ziff-Davis and Ziff's ZDNet online news service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was somewhat surprised by the sale,'' said Kevin Kuzio, an
analyst with KDP Investment Advisors in Montpelier, Vt. ``The
station had a logical tie-in with the Internet properties.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl Choi, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, estimated
that Allen paid about $20 for each of ZDTV's current 14 million
subscribers. ``It's a pretty good price,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, there are still concerns out there that this thing
will survive,'' Choi added. ``It's not sure how much interest there
is for a 24-hour computer channel.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Bay Area residents wouldn't know. ZDTV isn't carried on
most local cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ziff-Davis has estimated that about approximately  &LR; 16
million homes will be receiving ZDTV by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The cable venture, launched in May 1998, hasn't been a
profitable endeavor for Ziff, publisher of computer magazines like
PC Week and Yahoo Internet Life. Ziff-Davis lost an estimated $32.4
million on the channel in the first nine months of this year,
according to Choi.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ziff hasn't seen a dime in profit since going public in
April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The company said in July that is was hiring investment bank
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. to help it sell off its
businesses. The move followed Softbank's decision to focus only on
Internet investments.
</P>
<P>
   Softbank owns 70 percent of Ziff-Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ziff said it was selling its ZD Education operation
for $172 million to a venture fund managed by Wasserstein Perella
Group. In August, Ziff announced the sale of its ZD Market
Intelligence unit to Harte-Hanks, a direct-marketing firm, for $106
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to maximize value for shareholders,'' said Robert
Borchert, Ziff-Davis' director of investor relations. ``We believe
our share price has been undervalued by Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Ziff's stock closed yesterday at $17.81, up $1.06 from Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For Allen, who co-founded Microsoft Corp. with Bill Gates and
still sits on the software giant's board of directors, the
acquisition of ZDTV underlines a growing commitment to cable
enterprises. His Vulcan Ventures also controls Charter
Communications, the fourth-largest U.S. cable operator.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we wanted to list people we'd want to be associated with,
Paul Allen is No. 1,'' ZDTV's Wangberg said in an interview after
meeting with staff members at a series of ``town hall'' meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as very, very positive news,'' he said. ``It's
tremendous to get this recognition at such an early stage of our
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Wangberg and Ziff's Borchert declined to comment whether
Allen was the sole suitor for ZDTV. But a source said several
prospective buyers took a close look at the channel before the sale
to Vulcan was finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Allen is expected to visit ZDTV's offices on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Wangberg said that no changes are expected as a result of the
buyout, and that ZDTV will continue with current hiring plans. He
also noted that ZDTV is in talks with AT&AMP;T Corp. about the
possibility of bringing ZDTV to Bay Area cable subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay tuned,'' Wangberg said.

<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Few rivalries match the fear and loathing of
Florida-Florida State Week, the six-day binge before the rumble
between schools located a two-hour drive apart. The outcome always
affects the national college football landscape.
</P>
<P>
   For the 12th consecutive year, both teams enter Saturday's game
in the top 10. For the seventh straight year, the result will have
an effect on the teams that will play for the national title.
</P>
<P>
   This week's subplots will join the rivalry's treasured lore:
</P>
<P>
   _ Public service announcements that Bobby Bowden and Steve
Spurrier were compelled to make, asking their fans to demonstrate
sportsmanship, reduce drinking and, dadgum it, be nice to one
another.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ``Heistman'' T-shirts that University of Florida
entrepreneurs made to taunt the onetime Heisman Trophy candidate,
Peter Warrick. It shows the Florida State wide receiver toting a
Dillard's shopping bag and stretching a stiff arm with the caption:
It's Not Like He Shot the President! The reference is to Warrick's
arrest in October for accepting discounted clothes and his
subsequent remark about the scandal that erupted.
</P>
<P>
   _ The quarterback controversy that Spurrier has touched off
within his own team.
</P>
<P>
   _ The players' taunts and counter-taunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need all this other stuff,'' Bowden said. ``They're
going to play just as hard because it's Florida-Florida State. But,
boy, does it make it double tough when you know if we win it we're
going to the Sugar Bowl and if they win it they probably go.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that simple. The Seminoles come into their season finale
10-0, ranked No. 1 in the Bowl Championship Series ranking and
needing only a victory to book their flight to New Orleans and the
national title game. But the Gators (9-1) _ the BCS's No. 3 team _
can rip up Florida State's plane tickets by beating the Seminoles
and then either Alabama or Mississippi State in two weeks in the
Southeastern Conference championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Once the teams take Florida Field _ better known as the Swamp _
the week's subplots will be resolved. That is, if the teams take
the field without incident. Last year, the two teams brawled at
midfield before the kickoff when the Gators tried to prevent the
Seminoles from jumping up and down on the 50-yard line _ a Florida
State ritual that is part enthusiasm and part intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't have to happen,'' conceded Spurrier, who along with
Bowden participated in the television commercials in the hope of
heading off the unruly behavior and fights that resulted in more
than 140 fans being taken out of the stands by security at Florida
State last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``And to tell you the truth, I didn't know you could get a
player thrown out in pregame warm-ups. We got our best defensive
back thrown out, and they got a guy wearing blue jeans and a
jersey,'' he said of the ejection of defensive back Tony George and
two members of Florida State's scout team in the Gators' 23-12
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can assure you I've learned my lesson: we ain't going to
get anybody thrown out in pregame warm-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   If every player makes it to kickoff, the game shapes up to be a
battle of two formidable defenses trying to disrupt struggling
offenses. Once an aerial circus that averaged more than 34 points a
game in nine of the past 10 years, the Florida offense has been
temporarily grounded. It remains the 13th most productive in the
nation _ two spots better than Florida State. The Gators have
thrown for one touchdown in the last 10 quarters and put up a
paltry 33 points over their last two games.
</P>
<P>
   The coach was frustrated enough to replace Doug Johnson, the
starter for nine games, with Jesse Palmer for the game against
South Carolina, which was without a victory. The junior apparently
didn't win the job in a low wattage 20-3 victory. Spurrier says he
will use both Saturday against a Seminole defense that has recorded
28 sacks and allowed less than 3 yards a carry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hold any grudges against anybody,'' said Johnson, a
senior. ``Our main goal is to win, and that goes for whoever is in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles' offense, which played better in a 49-10 victory
over Maryland last weekend, has failed to find a consistent rhythm
since Warrick returned from a two-game suspension after being
arrested. He eventually entered a guilty plea for accepting more
than $400 of designer clothes for $21.40 _ a misdemeanor _ from a
department store clerk in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida fans will unmercifully harass Warrick _ the rattle
of Dillard's shopping bags is expected to echo in the Swamp. And
the Gators' defensive line, led by the sophomore Alex Brown, will
be just as ardent in pressuring quarterback Chris Weinke.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not, according to Tarlos Thomas. The Florida State
offensive tackle has been among the more vocal players this week.
He also picked a dangerous target: Brown and his 11{ sacks. ``Alex
had a couple of good games against some top-ranked teams, but I
don't really see nothing to him,'' Thomas said. ``What happens in
the other games? Every game should be a good game. He's just a
regular defensive end.''
</P>
<P>
   At first Brown tried to dismiss it as a cheap psychological
ploy. But this is Florida-Florida State, and he's not a regular
defensive end, playing in a game for regular intrastate bragging
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll read it every day and read it right before the game,'' he
fired back, ``and you'll see if he shuts me down.''

 Bitter Genentech Suit Finally Put to Rest  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A bitter lawsuit ended yesterday when the University of California
Regents unanimously accepted a $200 million offer from Genentech
Inc. to settle a 21-year-old patent dispute.
<P>
   The deal calls for the South San Francisco biotech firm to pay
UC $150 million in cash and contribute $50 million toward the $235
million cost of erecting the first building on UC San Francisco's
new Mission Bay campus.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference yesterday, UCSF Vice Chancellor Zach Hall
said UC negotiators offered to let Genentech suggest a name for the
building ``as a gesture of good will during the settlement talks.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, the largest in biotechnology industry history,
traces its roots to 1978, when several scientists at UC San
Francisco discovered the gene that produces human growth hormone.
UC filed a patent on the gene.
</P>
<P>
   In a June trial that ended in a hung jury, UC alleged that
Genentech copied this patented gene and created a billion-dollar
growth drug, without paying royalties to UC.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech chief executive Art Levinson admitted no wrongdoing
yesterday, calling the settlement ``a damage mitigation exercise''
that avoided a January retrial where either his company or UC could
have won it all.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been costly to both sides. UC officials estimate
they have spent $24 million in attorney's fees since they filed
suit in 1990. Genentech said its legal expenses were comparable.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Los Angeles meeting where regents approved the deal,
UC President Richard Atkinson said the board wanted to settle the
issue so individual UCSF and Genentech scientists could expand
their scientific collaborations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is interesting that on the one hand we could be engaged in
this horrendous court case and on the other hand engage in
cooperation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All along, the dispute was fraught with ironies arising from the
personal relationships between scientists at UCSF and Genentech.
For instance, Genentech CEO Levinson completed his post-doctoral
research in the lab of then-professor and now UCSF Chancellor Mike
Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Under UC rules governing payments for inventions, about $85
million of the settlement will be split equally among the five
scientists who originally discovered the growth gene while working
at UCSF in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   One of those scientists, German biochemist Peter Seeburg,
testified earlier this year that former Genentech scientist David
Goeddel faked a key experiment 20 years ago to conceal his alleged
copying of UC's gene.
</P>
<P>
   Goeddel, who is in the process of filing an initial public
offering for his own biotech firm, Tularik Inc., denied that charge
during the trial and defended the experiment in question.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech's Levinson repeated his vigorous defense of Goeddel's
reputation yesterday and declined to say anything about the fact
that Seeburg stands to earn $17 million as a result of the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regard the settlement as not speaking to either side'' of
the discrepancy in the two scientists' testimony, said UCSF's Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's settlement is the second time this year Genentech
has made large payments to settle legal questions surrounding its
growth hormone drug.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Genentech agreed to pay $50 million to end a U.S. Food
and Drug Administration probe into allegations that in the late
1980s and early 1990s it had encouraged Protropin prescriptions for
children who were short but otherwise healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech stock closed yesterday at $87.06, up $5.50 for the
day, on 833,000 shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

 Cheery Forecast for Retailers and E-Tailers Thanks to Robust
Bay  Area Economy  
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Strong economic conditions are expected to generate robust retail
sales this holiday season, particularly in the prosperous Bay Area,
economists and industry observers said.
<P>
   ``Lots of times Christmas sales are based on psychology, and
people are feeling very bullish right now,'' said Wilkes Bashford,
a Union Square men's clothier.
</P>
<P>
   Bashford expects Christmas sales at his store to be up in double
digits this holiday, with much of the growth coming from cashmere.
``The national economy is obviously strong and I think the
California economy is particularly strong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most brick-and-mortar stores' Yuletide won't be dampened by
e-commerce competition. That's because e-commerce, despite a
forecast doubling in growth in 1999, still constitutes well under 2
percent of spending on general merchandise, a category that
includes popular gift items such as clothes, books, furnishings,
stereos and home computers.
</P>
<P>
   For retailing as a whole, Deloitte &AMP; Touche is projecting a
general merchandise sales increase of between 6 percent and 6.5
percent this November and December against the same two-month
period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That's a bit better than the 5.9 percent increase tallied last
year and, if accurate, will be the highest growth since an 8.1
percent jump in 1994, according to economists at the consulting
firm.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast is particularly optimistic given that there is
virtually no inflation in general merchandise _ in fact, many
prices are falling, particularly among computers and apparel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is every indication that the economy is proceeding at a
very good pace ... so things are in place for a good Christmas,''
said Tom Lieser, executive director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast.
</P>
<P>
   In California's roaring economy, merchants are set to rake in a
disproportionate share of gift dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Gibson, chief economist at the state Department of Finance,
calculates that non-auto retail sales in the state could grow as
fast as 7 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with the same
period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at about 6.5 percent personal income growth this
year in California, compared to under 5 percent'' in the United
States U.S.  &LR; as a whole, said Gibson. Jobs in California are
growing at better than 3 percent, while nationwide the increase is
only about 2.2 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Tech Effect. ``The Bay Area continues to have
this huge amount of money just dumped on it by the stock market,
and I don't see that ending anytime soon,'' said Carl Steidtmann,
chief retail economist with PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Couple that with the recovery in Asia, which certainly helps
California as well, and I would expect California and San Francisco
in particular to outperform the rest of the country,'' Steidtmann
said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Jobs for Everyone
</P>
<P>
   Employment data are one indicator of how high gifts are likely
to be stacked under Bay Area trees this year.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. unemployment rate stands at 4.1 percent and
California's tallies 4.8 percent, the jobless rate in the San
Francisco-San Mateo-Marin jurisdiction is scraping bottom at 2.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only 2.5 percent of the San Jose labor force and 2.9 percent of
those in the Alameda/Contra Costa region lack jobs, according to
Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should be feeling pretty good about their economic
prospects, I would think, given that kind of unemployment rate,''
Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   Mirroring recent Christmases, spending on audio and video
equipment, computers and home furnishings are expected to be strong
this year, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of picture frames, candlesticks candle sticks  &LR; and other
gift items are up 15 percent this year at the San Francisco
GiftCenter and JewelryMart, said Alan Samuel, vice president of
marketing. In contrast, 1998 sales were flat at the GiftCenter, a
wholesale showroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The home sector continues to be big focus'' for American
consumers, said Shelley Nandkeolyar, a vice president at
Williams-Sonoma Inc. ``I think it will continue to be a big area of
growth for the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce, meanwhile, is expected to bring in $10 billion in
general merchandise sales in the fourth quarter, Steidtmann
estimates. That's double 1998's Internet sales of $5 billion, but
still puny compared with total general merchandise spending of
about $750 billion.

A STAR TURN FOR CHINA'S CULT BUSTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The animosity between Sima Nan and the Falun Gong
spiritual movement goes back a few years, ever since Sima, China's
one-man cult-bashing machine, denounced the group as a fraud in
1995, and the group's leader predicted that Sima would go blind and
be crippled, Sima says.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can see my eyes and legs are fine,'' Sima said
recently, with the swagger of a man who routinely captivates
audiences by eating glass shards and cracking chopsticks with paper
bills, all to prove that supernatural powers do not really exist.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the course of his decade-long campaign against
Chinese groups that he says encourage superstition and mystical
beliefs, Sima seems to have made enemies across the political
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   He has been beaten by members of sects he has denounced and
shunned by the government as a flamboyant upstart willing to
``out'' officials who believe in the supernatural, like the vice
minister who for good luck invites a master of qi gong _
slow-motion exercises said to harness unseen forces _ to important
events.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, Sima's longstanding feud with Falun Gong has
transformed him into an establishment darling, featured in
newspapers and sent to state companies all over the country to
lecture. In July, Chinese leaders banned Falun Gong and they have
since labeled it an ``evil sect.''
</P>
<P>
   The new role is unlikely and somewhat awkward for the
43-year-old former liberal journalist who turned to cult bashing _
and took the name Sima Nan _ when he found himself out of a job
after the 1989 government crackdown on protests in Tiananmen
Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995, I said Falun Gong was a cult and everyone said I was
crazy,'' he said. ``Now that President Jiang Zemin says it, people
agree with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sima is careful to maintain some distance from the
government, refusing its payments for his lectures. ``There are not
many people like me who are willing to take on these matters,'' he
said. ``I do this because I feel a responsibility to tell the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong has denied that it is a cult. The group says it
blends traditional Chinese exercise, mysticism, Buddhism and Taoism
to promote physical and spiritual health.
</P>
<P>
   Sima says he supports the government's ban on Falun Gong, which
he thinks is duping China's masses. But he remains ambivalent about
the government's campaign against the group, with vitriolic
propaganda and hundreds of arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they should let these people sit in the square,
but I also think it's really bad that the government is treating
this like a political movement,'' he said. ``To have people
criticizing each other for practicing and old ladies in tears
confessing on TV _ you don't have to humiliate people like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sima says the government's omnipresent anti-Falun Gong messages
have actually elevated the profile of what was, in his eyes, an
undistinguished group, catering to people looking for meaning at a
time of vast social transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are tired of all the criticism, and they think if the
government is paying so much attention to something, maybe it's
important and interesting,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In fact, he said, the state media's daily broadcasts and
articles on the group ``have been free advertising for Li
Hongzhi,'' the founder and leader of Falun Gong, who lives in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Sima, the son of a traditional Chinese medical doctor, said he
began his adult life as a believer in qi gong, which is said to
improve health and, some say, gives practitioners magical powers.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong considers itself a type of qi gong, and there are
hundreds of other schools in China that have flourished in recent
years, most with their own belief system and master. Sima said that
in his youth he certainly made the rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to believe in supernatural powers, and I was very
impressed with those masters who could do amazing things,'' he
said. But over time, he said, he grew skeptical of some of the
stupendous claims, like being able to levitate or cure cancer. He
says he still believes that qi gong exercises are good for body and
soul.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he embarked on a personal quest against many large qi
gong and other quasi-religious groups that he says promote
superstition and unscientific thought.
</P>
<P>
   Until this summer Falun Gong was just one of his many targets.
Sima said it is by no means the most popular of China's qi gong
sects. He listed several others _ Zhong Gong, Yuan Ji Gong and Wang
Gong _ which he said are bigger.
</P>
<P>
   He is critical of China's leaders for suddenly singling out
Falun Gong, noting that other groups that he considers equally
unscientific have been granted legal status because they enjoy the
patronage of government officials. ``Instead of just saying Falun
Gong is an evil sect, they should be using science to be proving
generally that there are no supernatural powers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government started attacking Falun Gong after 10,000 members
surrounded the leadership compound in Beijing in April, demanding
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Not one to shy away from confrontation, Sima has been know to
travel long distances to gate-crash qi gong meetings, confronting
faith healers and qi gong masters. In February, followers of one
man, Hu Wailin, beat Sima and trapped him temporarily in a house in
Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say that with his broad smile and theatrical bent,
Sima's greatest skill is not exposing superstition, but engaging in
self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   But after 10 years of crossing China in old trains and hundreds
of nights in spare government guest houses, he denies that fame or
money are his motivators. He lives on the income of a small
television production company he owns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's a natural on stage _ breaking spoons with a touch of
the hand and passing handkerchiefs though fire without igniting
them. He clearly loves the limelight. This week, he took a brief
respite from his government assignments to perform with an American
magician, James Randy, offering a huge reward to anyone who could
prove to be in possession of supernatural powers.

 Unions Create Internet Halls Without Walls  &HT;     By Sam McManis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Look for the union ... portal?
<P>
   Yes, in these waning days of the century, the AFL-CIO has
discovered the Internet. Starting December 1, members in the 68
affiliated unions can double click their way to solidarity through
a common portal _  &LR;   &LR; www.workingfamilies.com.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders also plan to offer computers to members for as
little as $600, and cut-rate Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine being able to ask millions of Internet users
to boycott a product or bombard elected officials with protests,''
said Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of
America. , said.  &LR; ``This will be a revolutionary tool.''
</P>
<P>
   To critics of organized labor, this late entry into the digital
age is just another example of why the AFL-CIO has been in a
downward spiral since the 1950s, when it represented 35 percent of
the workforce. Today, the union's share stands at 13.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they woke up and found, `Hey, we hear this Internet
thing is all the rage,''' said Patrick Cleary, vice president for
human resources at the National Association of Manufacturers.
``Having a Web site gives them a good feeling. But good feeling in
the face of facts to the contrary is delusion.''
</P>
<P>
   To union supporters, however, the Web site serves as one of many
reasons why the AFL-CIO is headed for resurgence after several
decades of benign neglect by organizers. At its biennial convention
last month in Los Angeles, AFL-CIO officials also vowed to improve
organizing of immigrant workers, minorities and Generation Xers, to
work more closely with community organizations such as churches and
advocacy groups, and to woo high-tech and service-industry workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You walked into the convention in L.A., and it wasn't your
grandfather's union living room,'' said Kate Bronfernbrenner, labor
specialist at Cornell University. ``It wasn't just white guys in
gray suits. It's changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Change can be seen most profoundly in California. Last year, the
service employees union in Los Angeles organized 70,000 home-care
workers, said to be the largest single union victory since the
'30s. And, in a reversal of long-held policy, the AFL-CIO now
supports amnesty for immigrant workers in hopes of enhancing
efforts to unionize California farmworkers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most concerted union effort in recent years is where
it might least be expected _ Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the South Bay Labor Council _ the 15th-largest AFL-CIO
regional affiliate in the country, representing more than 100,000
workers _ started its own high-tech temp staffing agency, Working
Partnerships. Amy B. Dean, Labor Council executive director, hopes
her staffing firm will grow into something resembling an old union
hall, where employers would make requests to the union for workers
and pay a fixed minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Dean's staffing firm differs from other temp agencies in that it
has portable health-care benefits for its 200 members through
Kaiser Permanente, a guaranteed minimum wage regardless of what the
employer is paying and on-site software and administrative systems
training. Eventually, Dean said, a pension plan will be in place
for workers. Most workers at the firm are clerical, but some are
``professionals'' in software and programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sending out people at 140 hours per week (collectively)
and we're about 40 percent into recovering the (startup) cost,''
Dean said. ``This wasn't just us (at the labor council) trying to
push this forward. It was people coming to us, telling us to put
this together. We haven't even launched a major marketing campaign
yet, and we're getting calls all the time from people wanting to
sign up. There's a need.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an outreach to so-called nontraditional union workers isn't
limited to temporary or contingent high-tech workers. Just a small
 &LR; fraction of the nation's 2 million computer developers, engineers
and programmers belong to unions, but big labor is trying to change
that through training and education.
</P>
<P>
   The CWA's Bahr said his union is forming a future organizing
base by joining with corporations in the worker-short high-tech
industry to train new workers. The CWA and nonunion Cisco Systems
have developed a program to train military veterans and union
members for high-tech jobs. The pilot training center, in
Washington, D.C., has 175 workers retraining, and Bahr said centers
in Sacramento, San Diego and Los Angeles are under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Bahr said, the workers will be placed in jobs, which
ultimately might lead to more high-tech workers seeking union
representation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These workers' initial contact is with the union, their
training is at the CWA facility, and hopefully they'll remember
that,'' Bahr said. ``If a programmer or systems analyst wants a
less-traditional trade union and more of a professional
organization addressing their concerns, we're able to provide
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The CWA also has assisted a group of 16 longtime Microsoft temps
who sued to get benefits and stock options afforded permanent
employees. The group has been paying CWA dues, and Bahr says he
sees his union as serving as more of a ``professional
organization'' than a traditional trade union.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Cornu, spokeswoman for the California Labor Federation,
said that because 1 in 4 workers in the state is contingent,
programs such as TogetherAtWork in San Jose resonate with some
nonunion members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get at least three e-mails a week from people for workers in
the `new' economy,'' Cornu said. ``The advances like the home-care
workers in L.A. and the bike messengers in San Francisco show the
union is repositioning itself and helping more workers find a
voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor analysts say the local International Longshore and
Warehouse Union's successful organizing effort to unionize bicycle
messengers and courier drivers in San Francisco in June would not
have happened as recently as three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Olney, director of organizing for ILWU, said current &LR; 
 &LR; AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, encourages such alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, we had our traditional ways and that was it,''
Olney said. ``It's a mammoth task rebuilding union numbers and it's
going to take a broader perspective to make it happen. ... Sweeney
has us fit the workers' needs rather than workers fitting the
union's needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Adams, the AFL-CIO's organizing director, said unions need
time to make headway in high-tech and service industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now responding to 20 years of not responding, whether
you're talking high-tech or low-tech,'' Adams said. ``It takes
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Academics who chart the AFL-CIO's progress are split as to
whether Big Labor can rally _ or, at least, avoid being irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that labor is laying the basis for future
victories,'' said Katie Quan, labor policy specialist at the
University of California at Berkeley's Center for Labor and
Education. ``But the numbers of rank-and-file members do matter.
For labor to come back, it's going to have to keep responding to
the changes in the economy. I think it's doing that''
</P>
<P>
   Countered Sanford M. Jacoby, a labor expert at UCLA: ``What the
labor market needs is a lot more than just high-tech temps to
recoup decades of losses. Labor has signed up for immigrant
workers, but they aren't able to pay high dues. It's an uphill
battle all around.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO, however, says it is up to the task. At the Los
Angeles convention, Sweeney told his constituency that his
organization is ``at the corner; we just haven't turned it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as of December 1, that long road finally will lead to the
so-called information superhighway.

NEW DATA RELEASED ON SIDE EFFECTS IN GENE THERAPY EXPERIMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (mk) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Six weeks after the Food and Drug Administration
placed a hold on two gene therapy trials for liver cancer, new
documents show that some patients in those experiments suffered
serious side effects, including changes in liver function and blood
cell counts, nausea and mental confusion. Also, a patient with a
history of strokes had a minor one.
</P>
<P>
   The side effects, which involved three patients in studies
conducted by Schering-Plough Corp., are significant because the
company used methods similar to those used by researchers at the
University of Pennsylvania, where an 18-year-old Arizona man, Jesse
Gelsinger, died Sept. 17 in a gene therapy trial.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger's death, which government officials say is the first
directly related to gene therapy, has focused increased attention
on the safety of the technology. After Gelsinger died, the Food and
Drug Administration stopped new patients from enrolling in the
Schering-Plough trials.
</P>
<P>
   The information about the liver cancer studies was contained in
reports released Friday by the Office of Recombinant DNA Research,
the arm of the National Institutes of Health that oversees gene
therapy research, which obtained them from the company. A spokesman
for Schering-Plough declined to discuss the data in detail but said
the side effects may have been due to the patients' underlying
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are late-stage patients who are very sick and have other
illnesses and problems,'' said the spokesman, Robert Consalvo.
``Many of these side effects, although serious, are not unexpected
in this patient population.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Gelsinger's death, the recombinant DNA office has been
collecting information from gene therapy investigators who use
adenovirus, a deactivated cold virus, as the vehicle _ or vector,
in scientific terms _ to deliver healthy DNA to sick patients.
</P>
<P>
   Both the University of Pennsylvania study and the
Schering-Plough liver cancer trials used adenovirus. In both cases,
doctors injected the adenovirus vector into the hepatic artery,
which supplies blood to the liver. But while the Schering-Plough
researchers were trying to treat liver cancer, the Pennsylvania
scientists were attempting to correct a rare metabolic disorder,
ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators at the university are still trying to figure out
what caused Gelsinger's death. They expect to present their
findings at a meeting of the NIH's recombinant DNA advisory
committee in early December. Scientists from Schering-Plough will
also speak at that meeting, which experts say may result in
restrictions on the use of adenovirus.
</P>
<P>
   The reports made public Friday did not identify the
Schering-Plough patients or list their ages or sexes. One patient
experienced changes in liver function and an elevated white blood
cell count after undergoing a gene therapy infusion; the
investigator conducting the experiment determined that the blood
cell changes were related to the therapy, although Schering-Plough
officials disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Another patient suffered a minor stroke _ although it was
unclear if it was related to the therapy, because the patient had a
history of them. According to the report, the patient experienced
chest pain during the infusion and later suffered the stroke after
being sent home. The company concluded that the gene therapy may
have contributed to the stroke by exacerbating the patient's
underlying condition. The report said another patient also suffered
a stroke, but did not provide details.

ARMY SWEETENS ITS SALES PITCH IN BID FOR ENLISTEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying hard to fill its ranks in an era of
prosperity and relative peace, the U.S. Army is offering bigger
enlistment bonuses and shorter hitches for some recruits.
</P>
<P>
   The inducements vary widely, and the Army's Web site encourages
prospective soldiers to contact recruiters for more details. But
even a cursory visit to the site is apt to be startling for
middle-aged veterans who recall a somewhat less hospitable Army.
</P>
<P>
   Sign-up bonuses up to $20,000 await some enlistees qualified for
the specialities most in demand, like intelligence posts. Moreover,
for the first time, qualified recruits will not have to choose
between a sign-up bonus and money for college. Some who qualify for
the $20,000 bonus may also be eligible for up to $50,000 in college
aid later.
</P>
<P>
   Enlistees who score high enough on their military-aptitude tests
can sign up for two years, instead of the traditional three, and
receive up to $26,500 for college or vocational training.
</P>
<P>
   The new bonuses are not a surprise in view of the military's
difficulties in finding and keeping people. There has been no draft
since 1973, and with a booming civilian economy there has been
little incentive for many young people to join up.
</P>
<P>
   For the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, the Army fell short
of its recruiting goal for the second straight year, recruiting
about 7,000 fewer men and women than the 74,500 it said it needed.
For the current fiscal year, the Army needs to recruit about 80,000
people to stay at its congressionally mandated level.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force and Navy have also had trouble attracting
recruits, although less than the Army. But their Web sites make it
clear that they too recognize the need to project themselves as
friendly and full of opportunities. (The Marine Corps, the smallest
of the services, continues its spartan approach: ``The few, the
proud.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Army bonus offers include $4,000 for enlistees who sign up
for three or more years and report for active duty no later than
Dec. 27. Recruits with some college training can get $4,000 to
$8,000. Enlistees who choose airborne training will get a $3,000
bonus, which can be combined with some other bonuses.

 &HT;    With pole, Lepage eyes sponsorship
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For Kevin Lepage, his effort in Friday's Georgia Boot
Qualifying, was a made-for-television event.
</P>
<P>
   Lepage is desperately seeking to renew his sponsorship with TV
Guide next season. He hiked his ratings by capturing the pole for
Sunday's NAPA 500 with a speed of 193.731 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may secure our sponsorship, but right now we have no
commitment from TV Guide for next year,'' Lepage said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Park, who has painful memories of Atlanta, also will have
a spot on the front row after running 193.569 mph. Park broke his
collarbone and right leg during a practice session before the March
1998 race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back at Atlanta, I love this place (but) it tore me up
one time,'' Park said. ``I was out for about six months (with the
injury). It would've been nice to get the pole here. We're on the
front row right now, so you can't be too disappointed with that.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second race in a row, a Winston Cup driver won his first
career pole. Following in the path of David Green at
Miami-Homestead Speedway, Lepage finally earned the No. 1 position
after 64 career starts.
</P>
<P>
   Driving a new No. 16 Ford, Lepage almost wrecked twice in the
third turn during a pair of mock qualifying runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to the (team), `We have got to do something (because) I
can't drive this car,''' Lepage said. ``We put our heads together
and came up with a setup that was good for qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we would be a top 25 car, but I never in my life
thought we'd be sitting here on the pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Practice sessions on the 1.54-mile quad-oval also paid off for
Lepage.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me coming here testing two weeks ago, I think was the
deal,'' Lepage said. ``We tested a lot of things and we were pretty
happy when we left here.''
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Jack Roush is confident TV Guide will remain with
Lepage. A decision will likely be announced within the next several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of qualifying, there were three other major surprises
in the top 10. Pontiac No. 30 driver Todd Bodine was fifth, posting
his first top 10 start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Blaney, who will run full-time on the circuit next year,
won the No. 7 position. Gary Bradberry, driving the No. 41 Chevy,
nailed down the ninth spot to qualify for his first race of the
season after four attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Buckshot Jones of Tucker turned heads by qualifying 11th. It was
Jones' best effort since earning the No. 7 position in the spring
Atlanta race.
</P>
<P>
   The second round of qualifying for the final 18 spots in the
43-car field starts at 11 a.m. today.

   JUDGE NAMES MEDIATOR TO SETTLE MICROSOFT CASE
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Penfield Jackson, the federal judge overseeing the
Microsoft antitrust trial, named a mediator in an effort to bring
about settlement talks between Microsoft and its accusers, the
Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Posner, chief judge for the 7th Circuit Court of
Appeals, was appointed mediator. Talks are to be voluntary and
nonbinding, and the schedule for the trial, which calls for a
verdict as early as February, was not altered; thus, the parties
have as many as 90 days to reach a deal.
</P>
<P>
   By title, Richard Posner is a federal appeals court judge. But
to a wide swath of intellectuals, he is one of the most fascinating
thinkers in the nation, especially about contemporary American
social issues.
</P>
<P>
   NASDAQ INDEX CONTINUES ITS ASCENT
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index of stocks climbed strongly, adding
22.14 points to close at 3,369.25, its 13th closing high in 16
trading sessions. Over all, though, stocks were mixed. The Dow
Jones industrial average fell 31.81 points to end the week at
11,003.89, while the broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
slipped 2.94 points to 1,422.00. The yield on the benchmark 30-year
Treasury bond closed unchanged at 6.16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS CONCLUDES BUDGET WORK
</P>
<P>
   Congress completed its work on the budget, ending a year of
political gridlock and breaking the spending limits that lawmakers
set for themselves for the second consecutive year. The Senate sent
President Clinton the last spending bills in a budget that includes
$17 billion more for the military and $2.3 billion more for medical
research than last year.
</P>
<P>
   CATERPILLAR SHARES FALL AFTER WARNING
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Caterpillar fell 12 percent after the company warned
that fourth-quarter earnings would not meet expectations. The
profit warning was the third in the last year at Caterpillar, which
said it was suffering from weaker-than-expected sales of its heavy
equipment in North America.
</P>
<P>
   OCEAN SPRAY DECIDES NOT TO MERGE
</P>
<P>
   In a move that angered many cranberry growers, the board of
Ocean Spray voted against pursuing a merger with another
packaged-food company. Ocean Spray has been battered by increased
competition, ill-timed marketing decisions and a surplus in the
crop; many growers blame the cooperative's management for the
problems. The chief executive, Tom Bullock, announced his
retirement in June but has stayed to help choose his successor. No
one has yet been named, though Ocean Spray said a new chief might
be chosen by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   UNION CHIEF SEEKS TRADE SANCTIONS
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO's president, John Sweeney, called on the Clinton
administration to scuttle a worldwide round of trade-liberalization
talks unless negotiators first take steps toward protecting worker
rights. Angered by this week's trade deal with China, Sweeney said
American labor unions want President Clinton to persuade trade
ministers gathering in Seattle on Nov. 30 to allow trade sanctions
against countries that violate basic labor standards, like the ban
on child labor.
</P>
<P>
   TEAMSTERS OFFICIAL FOUND GUILTY
</P>
<P>

director of the Teamsters union on fraud and conspiracy charges,
concluding that he helped divert union money to finance the

   HEDGE-FUND PROPOSALS CRITICIZED
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office has criticized a White House
panel's recommendations to minimize the risks that hedge funds pose
to the United States financial system, saying that the panel's
proposals do not go far enough to ensure safety.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Gucci uses computer-aided design to cast its bags and
has ultra-high-speed water jets to slice leather. So perhaps it is
only natural that alongside technology shares, luxury-goods stocks
have ridden a wave of investor favor: by last Thursday, the Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter luxury goods index had doubled from its level a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is getting richer,'' said Andrew November, director
of global strategy at Hill Samuel Asset Management in London. He
added that ``more and more people can afford these goods,
especially in the emerging markets.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, of course, much of the glow surrounding luxury goods
has been generated by mergers. Gucci Group, for instance, which is
awash in $3 billion in cash after it sold 42 percent of its equity
earlier this year to the French billionaire, Francois Pinault,
wants to transform itself into a multibrand giant. In the last 12
months, its shares returned 128 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Switzerland, Compagnie Financiere Richemont, which owns the
jeweler Cartier and luxury watchmakers like Vacheron Constantin and
Baume &AMP; Mercier, decided earlier this year to swap out of cigarette
and cable television businesses it owned in order to focus on
luxury goods.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Weber, an analyst at Bank Vontobel in Zurich, believes that
Richemont will eventually use the proceeds for luxury acquisitions.
Richemont's shares returned 94 percent over the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   In October, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton of France announced
an alliance with Prada, the Italian fashion house, to acquire 51
percent of Fendi, the design house in Rome. LVMH shares have
returned 124.7 percent in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Another, somewhat unlikely, entry in the luxury sweepstakes is
Switzerland's Swatch, which has assembled a stable of luxury
watchmakers that includes Omega and Blancpain. In the last 12
months, its regular shares have returned 42.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts think the run-ups mean that the stocks are fully
priced. The core European luxury goods companies in the Morgan
Stanley index, for example, traded at 33 times estimated 2000
earnings last week, versus a like multiple of 18 just 12 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Cox, a money manager at Templeton Funds in Britain, said he
had held shares of Gucci but accepted Pinault's tender offer
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet other experts said that, despite rising P/E's, there is
still value to be extracted.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Legros, a money manager at Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset
Management in London, said that while LVMH has cut costs at many of
its businesses, its apparel and Hennessy Cognac divisions could
benefit from efficiency drives. Gian Luca Manca, an analyst at HSBC
Securities, calls LVMH his favorite luxury goods stock. He says the
shares, which closed at 332.1 euros on Friday, will outpace the
market by 5 percent to 10 percent over 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Sagrar Maceira de Rosen, an analyst at J.P. Morgan in London,
said she believed that Gucci offers growth opportunities. In
October, she started coverage of Gucci with a buy rating and says
its move last week to acquire control of Yves Saint Laurent was
``strategically very positive.'' She said the shares, which closed
at 82.45 euros, or $85.7645, on Friday, could hit $100 in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Weber of Vontobel is enthusiastic about Richemont and Swatch,
now trading at 3298 and 264.5 Swiss francs, respectively. Both, he
says, will continue beefing up their luxury segments, ensuring
continued earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are risks.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury goods are a field strewn with egos, where shareholder
value can take a back seat to personalities. The takeover of Fendi
by LVMH and Prada hinged largely on the decision of Fendi's
ready-to-wear designer, Karl Lagerfeld, who did not relish working
for Tom Ford, Gucci's design genius.
</P>
<P>
   November of Hill Samuel Asset Management echoed other experts in
cautioning that the price jumps made it tricky to pick winners.
``If you're getting in at that level,'' he said, ``be sure it's the
right one.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley analysts give an outperform ranking to the
Italian jeweler Bulgari, whose shares have returned nearly 40
percent over the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   And analysts cite two companies as potential takeover targets.
In Austria, the luxury hosiery maker Wolford AG has seen its share
price languish, even as its growth potential is generally believed
to be strong.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Stefanel, the Italian fashion retailer, gained only
about 10 percent in the last year, despite rumors in September,
later denied, that LVMH was preparing a bid.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting the takeover premiums that such potential targets can
garner is difficult. But Morgan Stanley has calculated that over
the past 13 years, prices have averaged 14.6 times earnings before
taxes and interest; most recent deals have been higher.
</P>
<P>
   One uncertainty is whether the mergers will benefit
shareholders. Ms. Maceira de Rosen of J.P. Morgan said she saw ``no
huge synergies in the traditional sense'' resulting from the
current wave of takeovers, though she remained enthusiastic about
combinations like the Gucci-Yves Saint Laurent link.
</P>
<P>
   An acquisition by a multibrand giant with deep pockets, she
said, can give a smaller company the needed capital for expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Domenico de Sole, Gucci's chief executive, pointed out that the
very definition of a luxury brand ``tends to impose limits to its
growth, if it wants to remain an exclusive brand.'' Thus, he said,
a multitude of brands is required to guarantee revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, expect more mergers.

   No. 1 Florida State (10-0)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 5 Florida (9-1)
</P>
<P>
   In the last six seasons, the winner of this traditional battle
has gone on to play for the national title. This time, Florida
State, with its big offense, is favored over a Florida team that
has not allowed a touchdown in 10 quarters. Coach Steve Spurrier of
Florida warned, ``We're not as mighty as a lot of people think we
are, but we keep winning somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 15 Penn State (9-2)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 12 Michigan State (8-2)
</P>
<P>
   Penn State rushed for only 7 yards in losing to Michigan last
Saturday. Now it faces the Big Ten's best rushing defense, one that
held Ohio State to zero yards, Michigan to 6 and Iowa to 7. Bill
Burke will be at quarterback for Michigan State despite a strained
chest muscle.
</P>
<P>
   California (4-6)
</P>
<P>
   at Stanford (6-3)
</P>
<P>
   If Stanford wins, it will be in the Rose Bowl for the first time
in 28 years, an unlikely turnabout for a team that lost its opener
by 52 points. California has no chance if it throws six
interceptions, as it did last week in losing to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   EAST
</P>
<P>
   Harvard (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   at Yale (8-1)
</P>
<P>
   This is still The Game, especially for Yale, which has won eight
straight and can gain part or all of the Ivy League title.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia (3-6)
</P>
<P>
   at Brown (8-1)
</P>
<P>
   Brown seems about to win or share its first Ivy title in 23
years.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton (3-6)
</P>
<P>
   at Dartmouth (1-8)
</P>
<P>
   Except for missed conversions, Princeton played Yale even.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 Alabama (8-2)
</P>
<P>
   at Auburn (5-5)
</P>
<P>
   If favored Alabama wins, it will play Florida in the
Southeastern Conference title game.
</P>
<P>
   No. 6 Tennessee (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   at Kentucky (6-4)
</P>
<P>
   Despite an upset by Arkansas last week, Tennessee is still alive
for a major bowl.
</P>
<P>
   No. 13 Georgia Tech (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   at Wake Forest (5-5)
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech, first in the nation in total offense (511.1 yards
a game), seems headed for the Gator Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia (6-3)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 21 Mississippi (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   Two good teams trying to improve their chances for bigger bowl
games.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina State (6-5)
</P>
<P>
   at East Carolina (8-2)
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina State must win to become bowl eligible. It
probably won't.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Mississippi (7-3)
</P>
<P>
   at Louisville (7-3)
</P>
<P>
   The winner will represent Conference USA in the Liberty Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   MIDWEST
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State (6-5)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 9 Michigan (8-2)
</P>
<P>
   All Ohio State can do now in this frustrating season is be a
spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri (4-6)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 10 Kansas State (9-1)
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State's defense, so porous against Nebraska, should do
better.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   at Notre Dame (5-5)
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 13 years, Notre Dame may be bowl
ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHWEST
</P>
<P>
   No. 25 Mississippi State (8-1)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 24 Arkansas (6-3)
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State's chances for the Southeastern Conference
title are slim now.
</P>
<P>
   FAR WEST
</P>
<P>
   Utah (7-3)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 16 Brigham Young (8-2)
</P>
<P>
   A victory would send Brigham Young to the Liberty Bowl as the
Mountain West Conference's first champion.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State (2-8)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 22 Washington (6-4)
</P>
<P>
   Washington is still in the Rose Bowl picture, but needs help.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State (7-3)
</P>
<P>
   at Oregon (7-3)
</P>
<P>
   If Stanford loses to California, then Oregon or Washington could
sneak into the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   MISMATCHES
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Virginia Tech (9-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Temple (2-7)
</P>
<P>
   If Tech beats Temple and Boston College, which it should, it
seems a sure bet for the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers (1-9)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 19 Miami (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers, which upset Syracuse last week, faces an uphill battle
even against Ken Dorsey, a freshman backup quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Lafayette (4-6)
</P>
<P>
   at Lehigh
</P>
<P>
   Lehigh, tied with Colgate for the Patriot League lead, has too
much offense in this 135th meeting of neighborhood rivals.

COLORADO OUT TO PROVE IT'S STILL KING OF THE HILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Utah)  (js)

   COPPER MOUNTAIN, Colo. _ The skyline of the Rockies takes on a
distinctive change as Interstate 70 approaches the Copper Mountain
ski resort, about 80 miles west of Denver. It is not only snowy
peaks that reach skyward; so do a handful of construction cranes.
</P>
<P>
   With another winter season beginning Saturday, construction
crews at Copper Mountain have been working feverishly to finish
work on a new building for children's activities at one end of the
property and a restaurant-bar complex at the other. In between,
four new residential buildings are on schedule to open a year from
now.
</P>
<P>
   The project, like similar ones at many other Colorado mountain
sites, is part of a $230-million capital improvement effort by ski
companies to help Colorado regain its position as America's leading
state for skiing and snowboarding.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, for the first time in nearly two decades,
California took over the No. 1 spot. A recent survey commissioned
by Colorado Ski Country USA, a trade organization that represents
25 resorts, found that Colorado's overall market share of overnight
ski trips slipped by 2.7 percent to 16.2 percent, while
California's increased by 6.2 percent to 17.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive annual decline, and this trend has
sent shudders through Colorado's skiing industry, which considers
itself the best in the country if not the world. With the glorious
Rockies as their star attraction, Colorado skiing executives
routinely boast of offering the best peaks, the best snow and the
best amenities.
</P>
<P>
   But as the survey showed and as Colorado Ski Country's head
count over the last two winters confirmed, nearly half a million
skiers had either forgotten or grown weary of the same old same old
in Colorado, and many of them headed for mountains to the west.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, we felt comfortable and confident,'' said
John Frew, chief executive of the trade organization. ``But the
competitive environment changed quickly and dramatically, and we
had to ask ourselves, `Are we losing our pizazz?' There was a drop
in perception that we had, even though the drop in reality was ever
so slight. But when you're king of the hill, you can't let people
take potshots at you and stand still.''
</P>
<P>
   David Barry, the energetic chief operating officer of Copper
Mountain for the last two years, offered a less charitable
analysis: ``The state needs to get hungry again. The industry has
changed, and we have to figure out what we can do to ramp it up
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the state's problems began as early as 1992, when voters
refused to renew a special tax that was generating as much as $13
million a year for marketing, advertising and promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Ski operators were left to promote themselves until the state
legislature approved a $2 million allocation in 1997. That figure
was cut in half in 1998. Meanwhile, a survey conducted for the
state found that Colorado's share of year-round domestic pleasure
travel fell 30 percent between 1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the legislature approved $5 million for tourism
promotion. But even that might not be enough to overcome the
growing migration of skiers to resorts in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the bottom third among the states'' in spending
on tourist promotion, said Pasquale Marranzino, president of Karsh
&AMP; Hagan, the advertising agency for Colorado Ski Country and the
state tourism board.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal of state support came at a bad time for Colorado
ski operators. Since 1992, other states, like California, have been
having better luck with early-season snow. And Utah, where license
plates read ``Greatest Snow on Earth,'' has been aggressively
promoting itself as the site of the 2002 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ski operators say they are finding that Americans'
wintertime leisure habits are changing: travelers are seeking
resorts closer to where they live if the amenities are
substantially the same, and they are taking advantage of the
cheapest air fares. Marranzino said Colorado had suffered to some
degree because Southwest, a no-frills airline, does not serve
Denver International Airport but does fly to Salt Lake City and
several cities in California.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of circumstances finally convinced many Colorado
resort operators that they needed to improve, expand and find some
of the lost pizazz or risk losing even more customers this winter.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the planned changes are modest, like cheaper lift
tickets at Loveland Basin. Other resorts have invested in improved
equipment, like a new chairlift at Breckenridge. Aspen Mountain has
added five restaurants at the peak. Keystone has added runs for
expert skiers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no Colorado resort is doing more to lure back skiers and
snowboarders than Copper Mountain, which is owned by Intrawest, a
Vancouver, British Columbia-based operator of eight resorts in
Canada and eight in the United States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Visits to Copper Mountain have fallen steadily since the winter
of 1995-96; there has been an overall decline of more than 10
percent, to 867,794 last year. That made changes mandatory, Barry
said, but improvements had to reflect the shifting nature of the
customer base.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond making plans to add more than 1,000 housing units to the
current supply of 3,336 as part of a company plan to invest more
heavily in real estate, Barry said, he and his staff have begun
exploring more practical ways to broaden the resort's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not rocket science,'' he said, rattling off ideas. Among
them: expanding the ski school for children, installing small
toilets in rest rooms they will use, building new restaurants,
adding a disc jockey booth to the snowboarding site and instructing
resort workers to greet any guest within 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   One parking lot at the resort is reserved for families with
children. ``We got this one idea to put out plastic sleds so
parents have an easier time with equipment and their children,''
Barry said. ``Some people said, `But they'll get stolen.' I said,
`So what?' They cost $3. They're a souvenir.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing would help Colorado more this winter than a good dose of
early snow. So far, the weather has been unseasonably warm, and the
few resorts that opened early have relied on snow-making machines.
</P>
<P>
   But Colorado resort operators are not only hoping for early snow
to make it a successful season. They are also hoping for an
increased number of skiers to take advantage of it.

<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ A day after President Clinton and other
Western leaders confronted President Boris Yeltsin of Russia at a
meeting in Turkey, condemning his actions in Chechnya, Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas went them one better, calling for an end to
international aid to Moscow unless the Russian government stops
``killing women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot excuse Russian brutality,'' Bush said Friday morning
in the first major foreign policy speech of his campaign for the
Republican presidential nomination. ``When the Russian government
attacks civilians, it can no longer expect aid from international
lending institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the Ronald Reagan Library in the dry hills outside
Simi Valley, a suburb 40 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles,
Bush walked a fine line, balancing tough talk with more moderate
formulations. But he made it clear at the outset that he would hew
to the internationalist principles of his father and fight those in
his own party as well as those outside it who have sought ``to
build a proud tower of protectionism and isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' he said, ``is the shortcut to chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   While the governor implicitly criticized those Republicans who
reject trade agreements with China and turn their backs on the
United Nations, he was more explicit in his criticism of Clinton,
accusing him without citing him by name of allowing the nation ``to
move from crisis to crisis like a cork in a current.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing Clinton's leadership unfavorably to his father, Bush
declared:
</P>
<P>
   ``Alliances are not just for crises, summoned into action when
the fire bell sounds. They are sustained by contact and trust. The
Gulf War coalition, for example, was raised on the foundation of a
president's vision and effort and integrity. Never again should an
American president spend nine days in China, and not even bother to
stop in Tokyo or Seoul or Manila. Never again should an American
president fall silent when China criticizes our security ties to
Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush delivered his 35-minute speech with considerable aplomb,
turning in a well-versed, well-drilled performance that on several
occasions rose to presidential level. He quoted Burke and Pericles
and Alexander Solzhenitzyn, and he even echoed a bit of
Churchillian rhetoric when he promised a foreign policy built upon
``idealism, without illusions; confidence, without conceit;
realism, in the service of American ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy seldom plays a central part in American
presidential campaigns. But it can prove decisive if a candidate
gives the impression that the management of the nation's affairs
overseas is beyond his reach.
</P>
<P>
   That happened to Gov. George Romney of Michigan in 1968, when he
said he had been ``brainwashed'' by American officials in Saigon,
and some Bush backers had feared that he faced similar risks. He
had called the Greeks ``Grecians'' and failed to identify important
foreign leaders when given an in-your-face pop quiz by a Boston
television reporter.
</P>
<P>
   His confident performance Friday put such fears to rest for the
moment. But Bush will face a much tougher challenge in a series of
three debates with his Republican rivals, starting in New Hampshire
on Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   They will press him, no doubt, to say more specifically than he
did Friday about what he meant when he asserted that ``American
internationalism should not mean action without vision, activity
without priority, and missions without end _ an approach that
squanders American will and drains American energy.'' Bush argued
that ``unless a president sets his own priorities, his priorities
will be set by others _ by adversaries, or the crisis of the
moment, live on CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   Few would disagree with that. The problem is defining priorities
and criteria for action, which Bush made no real attempt to do. A
president, he said simply, should extend the peace, build a united
Western Hemisphere linked by free trade, seek Middle East peace,
check the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and do it with
``patience, wisdom and strength.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Robert Blackwill, a lecturer at the John F. Kennedy School of
government at Harvard University, who worked on the National
Security Council in the Bush administration, said that the governor
had concentrated heavily Friday on Russia and China because those
nations, ``not Haiti, not Somalia,'' impinged directly upon the
national interests of the United States. In fact, Bush made no
mention at all of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwill is a member of a small group counseling Bush on
foreign policy matters. It also includes Condoleezza Rice of
Stanford University, Paul Wolfowitz of Johns Hopkins University,
Robert Zoellick of Harvard, the German Marshall Fund of the United
States and Goldman, Sachs; and Richard Perle of the American
Enterprise Institute. All have served in past Republican
administrations, and several were with Bush Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two of Eurasia's greatest powers, China and Russia, are powers
in transition, and it is difficult to know their intentions when
they do not know their own futures,'' Bush told a largely invited
audience of about 400 people here. ``If they become America's
friends, that friendship will steady the world. But if not, the
peace we seek may not be found.''
</P>
<P>
   Consistency was one of Bush's main themes, especially on China.
Again without naming Clinton, he said the administration had called
the Chinese leadership ``the butchers of Beijing'' one year and
embraced the Chinese leadership as a ``strategic partner'' only a
few years later.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the governor said, he would stand up to China if
it threatened democratic nations in its region, such as Taiwan and
South Korea. He promised again to help Taiwan defend itself. And he
welcomed the idea of Chinese entry into the World Trade
Organization, while warning that ``it will take a strong
administration to hold them to their word,'' given what he termed
``China's poor record'' in honoring international agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must deal with China without ill-will, but without
illusions,'' Bush said in one of his many this-and-that statements.
China ``will be unthreatened, but not unchecked,'' he added a few
moments later.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced as ``a person who thinks for himself'' by former
Secretary of State George Shultz, who is an unofficial member of
the Bush brain trust, Bush spoke in a yearlong forum series
sponsored by the Reagan Library. Former first lady Nancy Reagan was
in the audience, as she was when Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
Bush's leading Republican rival, spoke here in September.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had many reasons to choose the Reagan Library as the venue
for his speech. California has more delegates to the Republican
convention than any other state, and Reagan went directly from two
terms as governor to the presidency without any previous Washington
experience, just as Bush is attempting to do.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Rice said, Bush wanted to contrast Reagan with
Clinton, especially with regard to the Californian's ``strength,
leadership and choosing a few goals, a few regions and
concentrating our national resources on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush won his loudest applause when he took a tough, Reaganesque
line in defense of what he called ``America's interests, America's
obligations and America's honor,'' and when he obliquely criticized
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to develop and deploy both theater and national
missile defense systems, and he ripped into the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty that the Senate recently rejected. The treaty, he said,
``does not stop proliferation, especially by renegade regimes by a
wide margin. It is not verifiable. It is not enforceable. And it
would stop us from ensuring the safety and reliability of our
nation's deterrent, should the need arise.''
</P>
<P>
   On the United Nations, he was again even-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never place U.S. troops under U.N. command, but the
U.N. can help in peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts,'' Bush
declared to warm applause at one point. ``If I am elected
president, America will pay its dues, but only if the U.N.'s
bureaucracy is reformed and our disproportionate share of its costs
is reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   There was even a slight bow to the French and their argument
that the American formula is not a one-size-fits-all model for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We value the elegant structures of our own democracy, ``the
governor said, ``but realize that, in other societies, the
architecture will vary. We propose our principles but we must not
impose our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush pre-sold his speech in telephone calls to columnists and
reporters in recent days, and his potential opponents, such as Vice
President Al Gore, had their aides calling to comment on it before
it had even been delivered. Clearly it was a big event in the
unfolding campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was put in a difficult position by Bush's call for an end
to international aid to Chechnya. Gore is closely associated with
the Russians, and he supported the administration when it held up
aid to Indonesia when its soldiers were killing people in East
Timor. It will be hard to argue that what the Russians are doing in
Chechnya is different.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing Republican criticism, the administration is reassessing
whether to announce a major resumption of American aid to Russia in
the next week or so, in the form of a half-billion dollars in loans
by the Export-Import Bank.

CATERPILLAR SHARES BATTERED AFTER WARNING ABOUT PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Shares of Caterpillar Inc. plummeted 12 percent Friday
after the company warned that fourth-quarter earnings would not
meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The profit warning was the third in the last year at
Caterpillar, which said Thursday that it was suffering from
weaker-than-expected sales of its heavy equipment in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of construction
and earth-moving equipment, fell $6.75, to $49.1875, on the New
York Stock Exchange. The drop also weighed down the Dow Jones
industrial average, which lost 31.81 points, to 11,003.89.
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar had warned earlier this year that it was having
trouble in Asia and Latin America, as well as seeing weakness in
the demand for its mining equipment. But Thursday, company
executives said that softening construction business in North
America and increased price competition had forced the company to
trim expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demand for our type of products (has) not risen'' to the level
the company thought it would, said Marsha Hausser, a spokeswoman
for Caterpillar, which is based in Peoria, Ill. ``North America has
been down, and the industry is softening.''
</P>
<P>
   The company released few details about its fourth-quarter
problems, saying only that its executives had been too optimistic
and that some revenue that was anticipated from a federal highway
construction bill had not materialized.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued early in the day, Caterpillar said that it
expected fourth-quarter revenue and profits to be slightly ahead of
the third quarter, in which the company reported earnings of 61
cents a share on revenue of $4.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had been projecting profits of 97 cents a share,
according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial. Wall Street
analysts reacted to Friday's news by drastically revising their
fourth-quarter estimates, though few made sharp cuts in their
forecasts for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three factors,'' said Tobias Levkovich, an analyst
at Salomon Smith Barney. ``The marketplace is not as strong, a lot
of equipment has already been replaced and interest rates are
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those who made revisions Friday, the consensus was that
Caterpillar would earn about 66 cents a share in the fourth
quarter, according to Charles Hill, director of research at First
Call, down from 83 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said there were indications that the construction and
housing boom that has been a main driver of the nation's economic
engine may have peaked, and that many construction companies may
have already reached full capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Although construction activity remains robust, several analysts
said that some of the world's leading construction and heavy
equipment makers, such as Ingersoll-Rand, Komatsu of Japan and
Deere &AMP; Co., have stepped up their manufacturing activity and
introduced new products and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many manufacturers making machines; everyone's
adding capacity,'' said David A. Bluestein, an analyst at Paine
Webber. ``We have a market that is still reasonably strong, but the
outlook is mixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the warnings, Caterpillar said it was witnessing a
rebound in its sales in Asia, and strong growth in its truck
engines and financial products divisions. The company said revenue
and profit for next year is expected to be slightly ahead of this
year, which if analyst estimates are correct could be $2.62 a
share, down 36 percent from $4.11 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   After record revenue of $20.9 billion in 1998, Caterpillar has
been trying to reduce costs and hoping for a turnaround in the
global economy. What was unexpected, analysts said, was that North
America _ which accounts for more than 55 percent of the company's
revenue _ would sour for Caterpillar in the midst of a strong
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, the company warned of an earnings slowdown, noting
that profits should improve in the second half of the year. But
third-quarter profits fell 34 percent, and if the revised forecasts
are accurate, they mean a drop of 20 percent from near record
profits of a year ago.

UNHERALDED ROUSH DRIVER WINS FIRST WINSTON Cup POLE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON, Ga. _ Kevin Lepage often is perceived as an
afterthought on the five-car Roush Racing team headlined by
superstars Mark Martin and Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   But Lepage earned what he hopes will not be his last 15 minutes
of NASCAR fame yesterday with his first Winston Cup pole during
qualifying for the season-ending NAPA 500 at Atlanta Motor
Speedway. Lepage toured the 1.5-mile quadoval in 28.617 seconds and
193.731 mph to bag his first pole in his 64th career Cup start.
</P>
<P>
   Not even teammate Martin _ one of the stoutest qualifiers on the
tour _ could match hot laps with either Lepage or Steve Park. A
protege of seven-time Cup champion Dale Earnhardt, Park qualified a
career-best second at 193.569 mph. Martin's speed of 193.191 mph
placed him third among the 25 drivers to lock in first-round
qualifying spots.
</P>
<P>
   Martin posted his 26th top-10 qualifying effort of 1999, more
than any other driver. But he graciously deferred to the two
front-row heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a racetrack where youthful skill and enthusiasm and
fearlessness ... there's a payoff for that,'' said Martin, driver
of the No. 6 Valvoline Ford Taurus. ``There's not a payoff at a lot
of the racetracks that we run, but this particular racetrack is
where there is a payoff. You have certain folks that are willing to
really lay it on that edge out here, and that shows. Kevin Lepage
laid it out there on the edge today.''
</P>
<P>
   Lepage did so, he said, after nearly twice wiping out his No. 16
TV Guide Taurus in Turn 3 during mock qualifying runs. Lepage
conferred with crew chief Pat Tryson on a chassis change and then
copied the line being run by Chad Little _ another Roush teammate _
through Turn 1 to solve the riddle of AMS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been known to hold anything back,'' said Lepage,
37, who tested here two weeks ago and returned with a car that had
finished ninth at Lowe's Motor Speedway, a sister 1.5-mile track of
AMS in Concord, N.C. ``Again, I attribute a lot of my success here
to setting up the car with all the guys, watching Chad's line into
Turn 1 _ and I never lifted. We got over the bump \Rin Turn 1\S,
and the car was perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nerve-wracking, believe me. I wouldn't want to do it
again. Not today, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Park's No. 2 start topped his previous career-best, a
third-place effort at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth in March.
Park has scored six top-10 qualifying efforts in his 56-race
career, all this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never been so disappointed in a second-place run. We
really wanted to win that pole,'' said Park, driver of the No. 1
Pennzoil Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``Looking back at Atlanta, I love
this place, and it tore me up one time. I was out for about six
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Park's rookie season ground to a halt here in March 1998, when a
crash during practice left him with a broken femur and collarbone.
He was sidelined for 15 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta really holds a lot of bittersweet memories for me,''
said Park, 32. ``We weren't going to let the injuries I sustained
in my rookie year distract from how much I like the new
configuration.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who is only 98 points behind Bobby Labonte in the chase
for second place, will start alongside track record-holder Geoffrey
Bodine in the No. 60 Power Team Chevy. Bodine set the qualifying
standard at 28.074 seconds/197.478 mph on Nov. 15, 1997, the first
time Cup trials were conducted on the reconfigured and repaved
racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Newly crowned Cup champion Dale Jarrett will start 10th after a
hot lap at 191.887 mph in the No. 88 Quality Care Service/Ford
Credit Taurus.

OCEAN SPRAY BOARD VOTES AGAINST MERGER IDEA 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that left many cranberry growers angry and
disappointed, the board of Ocean Spray has voted against pursuing a
merger with another packaged-food company, the company said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray has been battered by a series of recent woes,
including increased competition, ill-timed marketing decisions and
a surplus in the cranberry crop. Many growers, including some of
the largest farms in the 920-member cooperative, had favored a
merger, and the board had hired Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Bain &AMP; Co.
to study its options.
</P>
<P>
   Without releasing the consultants' reports, the board voted on
Thursday to maintain the status quo and then voted on Friday to
back up its decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last 70 years, we have created an incredible brand
and category that stands for health and refreshment,'' the
chairman, Don Hatton, said in a statement. ``We believe we can
continue growing our brand and ensuring the financial health of our
grower-owners by revitalizing the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes include redesigning the board, which now consists of
25 growers, to include three outside directors _ a first for the
cooperative _ and just 11 growers. The board also voted to pursue
financial help for growers who need it, including bridge loans to
tide them over until the industry picks up, Christopher Phillips, a
spokesman for Ocean Spray, said.
</P>
<P>
   But one grower said the vote did not address the desires of most
farmers, who have watched the price they get for each barrel of
cranberries plunge. The current price is $22 to $28 per barrel,
Phillips said, compared with $32 to $38 in June and $55 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fairly certain that a majority of growers favor the
merger, and the board doesn't reflect that,'' said Tom Gelsthorpe,
a farmer from Sandwich, Mass., who was recently elected to the
board. ``The people who oppose the merger have sentiments about
somehow recapturing the past. Those who favor the merger want to
raise the industry to a higher level.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray's largest member, A.D. Makepeace Co., has favored a
strategic merger between the juice company and a global consumer
products corporation and was clearly unhappy with the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Makepeace Co. is very disappointed and finds the board's
action unacceptable,'' said Robert Rosebe Jr., vice president for
finance. ``We think it puts everybody in jeopardy, particularly the
smaller growers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another farmer urged a recall of the entire board. ``It's really
in reaction to the intransigent attitude of our directors,'' said
Nabiel Shawa, a second-generation cranberry grower from Long Beach,
Wash. ``All I'm asking for is an open, democratic process. They
have been very tight-lipped. They have not been open or frank with
the cooperative membership.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said the board recognized the feelings of the
membership. ``Clearly there is some disappointment out there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many growers blame Ocean Spray's management for the problems
that have led the company into such dire conditions. Chief
executive Tom Bullock announced his retirement in June but has
stayed on to help choose his successor and assist with the
transition. No one has been named to the job, though Phillips said
the number of candidates had been narrowed to two and that one
might be selected before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry experts believe that Ocean Spray made a crucial
misstep in 1993 when it permitted a group of cranberry growers to
leave the cooperative. The growers formed Northland Cranberries,
which has launched aggressive marketing campaigns for its
pure-juice brands by taking direct aim at Ocean Spray, where the
flagship product, Cranberry Juice Cocktail, contains just 27
percent juice.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray countered last year with Wellfleet Farms, an
all-juice product, but sales were less than impressive because of
what Bullock has called ``a little trouble communicating'' with
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The company decided to relaunch the Wellfleet product line this
year as Ocean Spray Premium. But by then, a more severe result of
the Northland defection had emerged: an oversupply of cranberries
on the market. Ocean Spray also invested heavily in a new computer
system that botched many orders of supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   One farmer, in a posting on a Web site called Cranberry
Stressline, which has become a forum for growers' complaints,
reported that there were no cranberries, either fresh or dried, in
Publix supermarkets in Florida on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said the structural changes under way at the company
would produce a far different entity when they were completed,
though he did not know exactly when that would be. ``It will not be
the same Ocean Spray,'' he said, ``when this is over.''

FOYT SELECTS BLISS AS DRIVER FOR WINSTON CUP TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON, Ga. _ Mike Bliss is excited, and scared, at the
prospect of driving for legendary Texan A.J. Foyt next season.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a two-year contract, Bliss was officially introduced
as driver of Foyt's new NASCAR Winston Cup team at the Atlanta
Motor Speedway yesterday. Bliss will drive the No. 14 Team Conseco
Pontiac Grand Prix that will make its debut at the Daytona 500 in
February 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to be coming to Winston Cup,'' said Bliss, a
five-year veteran of the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series. ``And it's
pretty scary coming to Winston Cup, especially with a new team.
Because I have nothing to bring to the team. I would have thought
A.J. would have been looking for a veteran to start with. But I've
known A.J. for years, and what I like is he knows what it takes to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss spent the 1999 season driving the No. 99 Exide Batteries
Ford truck owned by Jack Roush. Bliss said that in order to drive
for Foyt, he had to buy out the remainder of his contract with
Roush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed a sure thing,'' Bliss said, ``and this is it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss finished in the top 10 and won at least one race in each
of his five seasons in the truck series. He has driven for Foyt and
partner George Snider in the U.S. Auto Club Silver Crown Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched Mike in some of the truck races, and he ran
strong,'' said Foyt of Houston. ``But to put this team together,
we're trying to do over a year's prep in six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt also plans to continue to field a two-car team in the Pep
Boys Indy Racing League in 2000. Irwin to join Sabates Former
Craftsman Truck and Winston Cup rookie of the year Kenny Irwin Jr.
will attempt to resurrect his career with Team Sabco.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin has signed a multiyear agreement to drive the No. 42
BellSouth and BellSouth Mobility Chevrolet Monte Carlos in the
Winston Cup and Busch Grand National series beginning in 2000.
Irwin's final start in the No. 28 Texaco Ford Taurus owned by
Robert Yates will be in the season-ending NAPA 500 tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, winless in 69 career Cup starts, will join Sterling
Marlin on the team owned by Felix Sabates. Irwin's crew chief will
be Tony Glover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited to be with Tony and Felix and the whole 42 crew,''
said Irwin, 30. ``I'll have a crew chief with a little more
experience. Hopefully, when I have a question on what's happening
with the race car, he can say this is what we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabates said he has followed Irwin's career since 1997, when he
won his first truck race at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth and
was named rookie of the year. Irwin won Winston Cup rookie of the
year in 1998. Gordon eyes Cup return Championship Auto Racing Teams
regular Robby Gordon, a bust in his first try at Winston Cup racing
two years ago, plans to return to the series full-time in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and his 1999 CART team co-owner, John Menard, are
scheduled to contest the full Cup schedule in a Ford Taurus. Gordon
described Menard, who also fields cars for reigning IRL champion
Greg Ray of Plano, as a ``minority partner'' in the Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon logged one pole and one fourth-place finish in 20 starts
for Sabates in 1997 before they split.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not have a fair opportunity to prove myself,'' Gordon
said of that experience. ``It wasn't that we hated each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said he also plans to compete at Indy in 2000, where he
will be teamed with Ray. Bodines sell No. 11 Brett Bodine is
vacating the Winston Cup owner/driver ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Bodine and his wife, Diane, have sold the No. 11 Ford team they
purchased from Junior Johnson in 1996 to businessman Richard
Hilton, who has secured a two-year sponsorship deal with Ralphs
Grocery Co. of Los Angeles. Bodine's current sponsor Paychex, will
not return in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a struggle,'' said Brett Bodine, who has a two-year
contract to drive for Hilton. ``It looks like the best thing for us
to do was to get out of the ownership role.''

<P>
   With all the attention being paid to the online rivalry between
Barnes &AMP; Noble and Amazon.com, could the smartest buy actually be
the shares of the beleaguered Borders Group?
</P>
<P>
   That is what investors in Borders are hoping. Last Monday, some
of them were cheered by what the market perceived to be good news:
Borders, the bookseller based in Ann Arbor, Mich., hired a new
chief executive: Gregory P. Josefowicz, formerly president of
Jewel-Osco, a division of Albertson's, the supermarket giant. News
of the appointment sent Borders shares up 6 percent in one day.
</P>
<P>
   Josefowicz replaced Philip Pfeffer, who resigned in April after
only five months on the job, during which the stock price
languished; Pfeffer previously was chief executive of Random House.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the appointment of Josefowicz, however, the strong
market position and cash flow of Borders had begun to attract value
investors. The company operates 284 Borders Books and Music
superstores, nearly 900 Waldenbooks mall stores and about 40
bookstores overseas. It had $2.60 billion in sales last year, not
far behind Barnes &AMP; Noble, at $3.01 billion, and far ahead of
Amazon, at $610.0 million. Driving Borders' growth are its
superstores and international outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the jump last week, Borders shares are still down more
than 42 percent since Dec. 31; they are now at $14.375. The stock
is trading at just 10.5 times analysts' estimated earnings of $1.37
a share for the year ending January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble, by contrast, is trading at over 15 times next
year's earnings estimates. Amazon is expected to post a loss for
its 2001 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``At these prices, I'm buying,'' said Alan Snyder of Snyder
Capital Management of San Francisco, who since June has nearly
doubled his stake in Borders, to 3.6 million shares _ about 4.6
percent of the company's outstanding stock. Other big buyers
include Lazard Freres, which quadrupled its stake this year, to
3.43 million shares as of Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   And the largest shareholder, Dreman Value Management, which owns
more than 10 percent of the outstanding shares, has been adding to
its position. David Dreman, chief investment officer, said he is
looking for the stock to rise by at least 50 percent over the next
12 months or so as Borders implements a new Internet strategy and
resolves its management turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Borders is an excellent bookseller that got slammed because it
was late to the Internet,'' Dreman said.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors are optimistic about the company's use of the
``clicks and mortar'' strategy, in which walk-in customers use a
Borders intranet site to search for titles and order books once
they are in the store. Borders partisans say this combination of
traditional and online retailing may help the company sidestep
online price wars.
</P>
<P>
   Though it has tried to compete on the Internet, the Borders
site, Borders.com, runs a distant third to Amazon and Barnes &AMP;
Noble, in part because the company did not begin generating sales
from it until late 1998. Online sales accounted for less than 1
percent of revenue in the third quarter. The site has also been a
drag on earnings _ the reason that Borders posted a third-quarter
loss of 2 cents a share on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's all-important superstores had healthy growth
in same-store sales _ for those open at least a year _ of 6.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Without the Internet operations, Dreman said, he figured that
Borders would be in a position to post full-year profits of $1.30 a
share. Instead, analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial
estimated that it would earn just $1.16 a share.

 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government's top air safety
investigator took a swipe at his partners in the investigation of
the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 and at the news media Friday,
complaining that ``some unidentified sources'' were saying things
about that plane's cockpit voice recording that was resulting in
headlines that were ``just flat wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   While reiterating that investigators believed the crash could
have been deliberate, the official, James E. Hall, the chairman of
the National Transportation Safety Board, said some inaccurate
reports about what was on the tape had ``caused pain for the
families'' and had ``not promoted the interests of aviation
safety.'' He also said the reports had ``done disservice to the
longstanding friendship'' between the United States and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Hall did not identify the sources or the news reports and also
declined to identify the misinformation, saying that the board was
not yet ready to characterize the tape's contents. Federal law
gives the five-member board control over the release of information
in crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The board also released new technical information about the Oct.
31 crash.
</P>
<P>
   The furor over the cockpit voice recorder began on Monday, when
Hall himself said that investigators' main focus was to determine
whether the crash of the Boeing 767, which killed all 217 people
aboard, was an aviation accident or a deliberate act. If it was not
an accident, under law that would put the FBI in charge of the
investigation, with the safety board in a support role, the reverse
of the current situation.
</P>
<P>
   Since Hall's first statement on the subject, a variety of news
organizations have published information from government sources
about the contents of the tape, which has cast suspicion on a
co-pilot, Gameel el-Batouty, who some investigators believe
deliberately crashed the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, however, The Wall Street Journal published an
article reporting that ``senior Justice Department officials'' had
retracted an earlier statement obtained by The Journal that said a
crew member was heard to say on the tape in Arabic that ``I have
made my decision now.'' That phrase was attributed to a crew member
in several publications.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal said the officials had not disavowed another
statement on the tape, ``I put my faith in God's hands.'' The New
York Times reported that investigators said that a crew member had
said he put his faith in God, but not that he had made a decision.
The statement about God is a common one in Egyptian Arabic and many
Muslims said it had no religious significance. But, investigators
say that statement, along with the absence of any sign of trouble
on the flight data recorder, is the basis for the safety board's
worry that the crash may not have been an accident.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also Friday, the board released a preliminary chronology of
events in the crash, beginning at 1:49:46 a.m. on Oct. 31, with the
disconnection of the autopilot.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder does not distinguish between the
autopilot's disconnecting itself, which would be a clear sign of a
mechanical problem, or being disconnected by a crew member. But an
automatic disconnection causes a ``master warning'' alarm to sound,
while a manual disconnection does not, if a crew member pushes the
button twice quickly, like a double mouse-click. And, according to
Friday's chronology, the master alarm did not sound until 22
seconds later, when the plane exceeded its speed limit, 86 percent
of the speed of sound, after being in a dive for 14 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The plane reached its maximum nose-down pitch, 40 degrees, 28
seconds after the auto pilot disconnect, and stayed at that angle
for four seconds. It was in zero G _ that is, the passengers were
weightless _ for about 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane did not go supersonic, but its maximum speed did
reach 94 percent of the speed of sound. It is designed to go no
faster than 85 percent of that.
</P>
<P>
   A team of U.S. investigators arrived in Cairo Friday, and Hall
said they had received the maintenance records of the airplane and
were examining them.
</P>
<P>
   Hall also said that the Navy had contracted for a salvage ship,
the Smit Pioneer, which was big enough for operations in rough
seas. It is in Lisbon and will arrive at Quonset Point, R.I., the
recovery operation's headquarters, around Dec. 1, he said. The
crash site is about 60 miles from Nantucket.

 &HT;    Barak maps tough peace path
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He comes from a tough neighborhood: the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   And, characteristically, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak made
the best of a tough situation Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was en route to Atlanta when his plane, Israeli Air Force
One, was damaged during a refueling stop in Manchester, England.
Unable to continue and make his scheduled landing here at 6 a.m.,
Barak retreated to the Manchester airport's VIP lounge and
videotaped a speech he had been scheduled to give to the General
Assembly of the United Jewish Communities here.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to satellite transmission, the speech made it to a screen
at the Atlanta Civic Center on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   It gave the prime minister, who was elected in May, an
opportunity to thank Jewish leaders attending the gathering for
their support for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   And it gave Barak, the warrior turned statesman, a chance to lay
out his broad vision for Israel's future.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, 57, had served his country as interior minister and
foreign minister. But he rose to prominence on the strength of his
reputation as Israel's most decorated soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Born on a kibbutz and drafted into the military at age 17, he
served in an elite commando unit, fought in Israel's 1967 and 1973
wars and commanded forces during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon. In
one of his most daring _ and now famous _ exploits, he sneaked into
Lebanon in 1973 and, dressed in women's clothes, planted explosives
that killed three Palestinians responsible for the terrorist attack
on Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany. Barak
also was the mastermind behind a raid on the Entebbe, Uganda,
airport that freed Israeli hostages from hijackers. By the time he
left the military in 1995, he was the army chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   In security-conscious Israel, credentials like that go a long
way toward giving a politician credibility. But Barak, who
described himself as ``a new prime minister and an old soldier,''
also demonstrated that he is not afraid to talk like a peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Israel stands at a unique juncture, he told the audience at the
Atlanta Civic Center. And like his mentor and friend, assassinated
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, he believes in ``making the peace of
the brave with all our neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite setbacks, Barak has expressed commitment to reaching a
final peace deal with the Palestinians. He has pledged to strive
for progress in negotiations with Syria and hopes he can withdraw
Israeli troops from Lebanon within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Barak did not go into specifics of those plans in his short
speech, but he offered a vision of what such accomplishments could
mean. He said he looks forward to a day when the young people of
Israel can expect to ``go to school, not to war'' and to ``compete
on the football field rather than on the battlefield.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk has generally won Barak respect in the Arab world, but
he also made it clear that he will be no pushover as a negotiator.
He won applause from the audience when he spoke of Jerusalem as
``forever the one indivisible, eternal capital of Israel,'' despite
Palestinians' claims to part of the city. And he pledged to accept
only peace that strengthens the security of his nation, a statement
that won more applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not mean a peace of illusion that could endanger our
security or dissolve before our eyes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that a ``comprehensive peace settlement'' in the
Middle East will be ``safer for Israel and the world as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak also spoke of his mission within his country, where he is
attempting to unify an often raucous democracy. He swept to office
by a large margin and today governs with a broad coalition of
support. ``I'm trying to be the prime minister of all segments of
our society,'' he said, calling for an era of ``change, hope and
healing.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak was praised by Bernard Marcus, co-founder of Home Depot
and international chairman of the General Assembly, as a serious
and studious man of great courage and great principle. ``My
observation of Prime Minister Barak is that he is a man to be
trusted,'' Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli leader also is a man of many talents. He earned a
master's degree in systems analysis from Stanford University, and
he also is an accomplished classical pianist.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, even via satellite, he struck the right chords for
his audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, to be for Israel is to be for peace,'' he said to
applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fateful choices for the future of our people'' lie ahead, he
added. ``I ask you to walk with me.''

GATORS' VICTORY TODAY IN SHOWDOWN COULD BE VIRUS FOR BCS COMPUTER
RANKINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this age of cable access, 24-hour talk shows and www.com-ing
information distribution, hype is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Florida State-Florida game, though, is a bit more
old-fashioned. The No. 1 Seminoles play the No. 3 Gators in
Gainesville in what is basically a semifinal game in the 1999
national-championship chase. No tub-thumping required.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy to get caught up in all the hype and trash
talking,'' Florida defensive end Derrick Chambers said. ``Trash
talking don't win the game. All that hype doesn't do anything for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, ``It's such a big
rivalry, you don't need all this extra stuff. But, boy, does it
make it double tough when you know the winner goes to the Sugar
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The national championship game, as determined by the Bowl
Championship Series computer rankings, will be played at the Sugar
Bowl on Jan. 4. Four times in the past six seasons, the winner of
this game has played for the national title. This is the 11th
consecutive season both teams have been ranked in the top 10 when
they play.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden and Florida coach Steve Spurrier have their own rivalry.
Asked this week what he and Spurrier had in common, Bowden said,
``We're both male. I guess that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both coaches, in an effort to dial back the fever-pitch frenzy,
taped public service announcements this week that urged good
sportsmanship. The theme: ``Put the class back in the classic.''
</P>
<P>
   Good luck with all that.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd in excess of 83,000 will turn Ben Hill Griffin Stadium _
aka The Swamp _ into a high-decibel mosh pit. And Gators fans have
an easy target in Seminoles wide receiver Peter Warrick, who was
charged with a misdemeanor earlier this season for accepting
merchandise at a reduced price. A hot-selling T-shirt in
Gainesville depicts Warrick as ``the 1999 Heistman Trophy winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State offensive tackle Tarlos Thomas took a verbal jab
at Florida defensive end Alex Brown this week. Brown has 12 of the
Gators' 38 sacks, but five of those came against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex had a couple of good games against some top-ranked teams,
but I don't really see nothing to him,'' Thomas said. ``What
happens in other games? Every game should be a good game. He's just
a regular defensive end. Basically, from what I see, he's just
trying to time with the snaps. I'm going into the game to shut him
down, point blank.''
</P>
<P>
   Your rebuttal, Mr. Brown?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarlos is just talking, trying to get something in my head,''
Brown said. ``I'll read that. I'll read it every day and read it
right before the game, and you'll see if he shuts me down.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Thomas and Brown were channel surfing when those
public service announcements aired.
</P>
<P>
   Before last year's game in Tallahassee, Fla., the Seminoles and
the Gators clashed at midfield as Florida State players did their
traditional midfield jumping. Florida defensive back Tony George, a
co-captain, was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you I've learned my lesson; we ain't going to get
anybody thrown out in pregame warm-ups,'' Spurrier said. ``We're
not going to midfield, they can jump all they want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, who was upset that his players challenged and taunted
Clemson's players as they made their way on the field earlier this
season, also plans a pregame detente.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sure going to try to tone that down,'' Bowden said.
``We'll go jump around on the 30.''
</P>
<P>
   While the signs and the individual catcalls will be aimed at
Warrick, Florida State's offense must operate in The Swamp's sea of
sound. The Seminoles' no-huddle offense requires quarterback Chris
Weinke to call out and/or signal plays at the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weathering the storm is the big thing, staying calm and
cool,'' Florida State offensive coordinator Mark Richt said. ``Any
little mistake you make gets magnified by the reaction of the
crowd. But I don't think you can get that crowd out of that game.
You'd have to be up by 21 to get them sitting on their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the attention will be on Florida's offense, which has
struggled most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Spurrier alternated quarterbacks on every snap to
spring an upset of top-ranked Florida State. Last season, Florida
State used eight defensive backs to limit Florida to 17 yards on 20
rushing attempts. Spurrier and Bowden are known for their strategy
and tactics. Expect the game to turn on a coaching ploy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot \Rof unused plays\S saved that we haven't used
this year,'' Spurrier said. ``Obviously we need some new plays. The
ones we have right now are not going very far.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State has been No. 1 all season and is one victory away
from giving Bowden his first undefeated regular season. Bowden
calls the loss in Gainesville two years ago _ the Gators went 80
yards in three plays for a last-minute TD _ one of his worst ever.
Florida State's last victory in Gainesville came in 1993, the year
Bowden won his only national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we're going in there in as good a circumstance as
we can go in,'' he said. ``You still have to go down there and do
it, and the odds of playing and winning in that stadium are not
great, and yet the year we won the national championship, we did
it. You wonder if those are signs.''

NORTH KOREA OPENS A DOOR BUT NOT NECESSARILY ITS MIND-SET  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ In the two months since it agreed to freeze
its long-range missile tests in exchange for the United States
lifting economic sanctions, North Korea has been swamped with
inquiries from foreign companies, investors and trade groups
seeking to do business there.
</P>
<P>
   With a population of 24 million, a low-cost, well-trained work
force and close proximity to two important Asian economies, South
Korea and Japan, North Korea has its attractions as a site for
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   Though the inquiries have led to several highly publicized trade
missions to North Korea, few, if any, foreign firms are expected to
actually set up shop there any time soon, because of one obstacle
that has not changed: the hermetic country's Stalinist political
climate.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, consultants and people who have done
business with North Korea said that unless the reclusive regime of
Kim Jong Il simplifies the investment process and makes its
dealings more open and businesslike, substantial new foreign
investment and trade are unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of investors will come to Pyongyang on a trade mission
and take one look at the way North Korea operates, and they will
never come back,'' said Anthony Michell, president of Euro-Asian
Business Consultancy Ltd., which advises companies with an eye on
northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Michell said that North Korea might be an attractive place to
manufacture goods for export to the United States, now that such
trade will be legal, but that foreign companies will have to endure
a long, convoluted and frustrating negotiation process to get
established.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest turnoff is dealing with an old-style Communist
system in which people don't understand the ways of the world,''
said Michael Breen, a public relations consultant who has advised
companies seeking a foothold in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very bureaucratic place, and party politics rule,''
Breen said. ``It's easy to be misunderstood, and most people who
are friendly and supportive of the regime eventually run afoul and
get thrown out.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the case of a Belgian entrepreneur who set up a
diamond-cutting business in North Korea that employed several
hundred people. The business thrived for a while, and the
government often showed off the factory to foreign trade
delegations. Then the entrepreneur was forced to leave the country
without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Korea doesn't see you as an individual, but as part of
the agenda of your country,'' Breen said. ``Something happens at a
high level with your country's government that they don't like, and
the North Koreans take it out on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors remain interested. A few pioneers, mainly South
Korean conglomerates like Hyundai, Samsung and Daewoo, have already
made major investments in tourism and manufacturing in North Korea.
And the American Chamber of Commerce in Seoul plans to take a
delegation of 10 United States business executives _ chosen from
more than 90 applicants _ on a trade mission to North Korea as
early as next month.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, nobody who does business in North Korea is going to
make a lot of money right out of the starting blocks,'' said Jeff
Jones, president of the chamber. ``It's a beginning, and everybody
knows that it will be slow and difficult. But over time we believe
that North Korea will learn how to deal with U.S. businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the delegation will be seeking assurances from North
Korea on remittances, ownership rights and security issues, the
chamber said, and will want to see if distribution and
transportation facilities, regulatory systems and labor will be
adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the initial business activities in North Korea are
likely to be in areas like infrastructure development, finance,
agriculture and telecommunications. For example, Motorola, the
mobile telephone company, will join the delegation. Much of North
Korea has not been wired for basic telephone service, and it may be
faster and more economical for the country to install a national
cellular system instead.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration agreed to relax sanctions under the
Trading with the Enemy Act, dating from the Korean War in the
1950s, after North Korea pledged to stop development of a
long-range missile that threatened to upset the balance of power in
Asia. The country's erratic behavior has long scared off investors;
in the last year it has provoked a naval skirmish with the south
over fishing rights and held a tourist captive on charges of being
rude.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's most important to attract investors is the improvement
of North-South relations and a reduction of military tensions
between the two,'' said Myoung Gyon Chu, an official at South
Korea's Unification Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   If large-scale foreign investment comes to North Korea, most
analysts expect it to be on the coattails of the South Korean
companies already making headway there. The biggest investor by far
is Hyundai Group. A year ago, in the biggest inter-Korean joint
venture since the country was partitioned in 1945, Hyundai began
running sightseeing cruise tours of Diamond Mountain, a scenic
attraction on North Korea's east coast.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the Daewoo Group has operated a 1,300-employee joint
venture in the north to manufacture shirts, jackets and bags for
sale in Europe, Latin America and Japan, including items under the
Pierre Cardin label. It exports about $25 million of apparel a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ki Hwan-moon, general manager of Daewoo, said it took $5 million
and four years of negotiations with North Korea to get the company
up and running. ``We decided to do it because there was a new
market opportunity, the production costs were lower and the workers
speak the same language,'' he said. ``Part of the investment is to
promote good will and improve relations between the two
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   But even major South Korean companies like Hyundai, which has
long been a champion of investing in North Korea, sometimes find it
difficult to deal with Pyongyang. Hyundai reached an agreement on
Oct. 1 to build a new industrial complex to make a variety of
consumer products, but a follow-up delegation twice had to postpone
a visit to the country because of a difference over where to build
it: the company favors Haeju, a western port city less than 100
miles from Seoul, while the government prefers Sinuiju, far to the
north near the Chinese border. The delegation finally began its
trip last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are closely watching Hyundai's experience in
North Korea. Ghil Joon Choi, director of North Korean business
projects for Samsung Group, said that he expects similar delays in
obtaining approval to build a large consumer electronics factory
and set up a fish-importing business there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no real progress since our last trip to North
Korea,'' around the time of the June naval skirmish, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why foreign companies should consider North Korea worth
the frustrations and risks, Jones, the chamber president, argued
that economic integration would help stabilize the country, whose
24 million people will one day offer a lucrative market
opportunity, just as South Korea did a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't work out, then I guess we will lose a few bucks,
but given how hard-working and bright the Koreans are, I suppose it
will work,'' he said.

SOWARD, KELLY FEEL THE FRENZY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One USC receiver is ending his career while
another's is just beginning, but today's game against UCLA is
equally important for R. Jay Soward and Kareem Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my whole season. My whole senior year,'' Soward said. ``I
represent a lot of guys who've never beat these guys and we have to
end the streak. They're acting like it's too easy to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   While this is Soward's last chance to defeat UCLA, it will be
the first chance for Kelly, who is just as eager to end the
eight-game losing streak to the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about this game since last year,'' Kelly
said. ``I was at home watching it on TV and I felt the emotions.
It'll be a great experience for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a sellout crowd of 92,000 is expected, Kelly said he
will not get nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I perform well in big crowds. I don't feel any pressure,''
Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   The real question might be how many opportunities Kelly is
given. Although he leads the Trojans with 50 receptions for 863
yards, he has caught just seven passes in the past two games, and
suggested he was a ``decoy'' against Arizona State two weeks ago,
when he caught one pass in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly expects to be a vital part of the Trojans' offense today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a game for me to be a decoy. It's wise to use all
the weapons,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Blood Bowl: In the Blood Bowl football game between the Daily
Trojan and Daily Bruin on Friday at UCLA, the Daily Trojan won
43-25.

   Band Bowl: In the annual battle between USC and UCLA's bands
this week, the Trojans won 20-18.
</P>
<P>
   One last comment: USC coach Paul Hackett can't be accused of
underplaying the rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, this city is about this rivalry in football,''
Hackett said. ``For eight years, we've come up on the short end. I
don't know if there's anything more important than breaking the
streak, regardless of all the other things that are involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the focus is how do we turn the tide? That program is
at the zenith. They're at the top. It's time to take it over. When
you look at our season and look at our seniors, it's their
opportunity to make a contribution at the end of their careers.
There's a huge amount at stake for our program.''
</P>
<P>
   Lineup changes: Freshman wide receiver Marcell Allmond will
start ahead of Soward, who practiced sparingly to rest his strained
left hamstring. Soward said he will play.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Darrell Rideaux will start in place of Antuan
Simmons, who had back surgery Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Long memory: Cornerback Kris Richard remembers USC's last
victory over UCLA in 1990, when Johnnie Morton caught a touchdown
pass in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting old. I was only 11. I remember Johnnie's catch,''
Richard said. ``I thought he was out (of bounds). Nah, I remember
him making a good catch.''
</P>
<P>
   All-Academic team: USC tailback Chad Morton was named to the
Pacific-10 Conference's All-Academic team for the fourth straight
year. Other first-team members included quarterback Mike Van
Raaphorst, strong safety Frank Carter and fullback Brennan Ochs.
Tight end Scott Huber made honorable-mention.

McCANN IS THE KEY FOR BRUINS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He was confident and carefree early in the week,
but there's no telling what UCLA freshman quarterback Ryan McCann
will feel today as kickoff approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm overwhelmed with excitement; it's going to be a blast,''
McCann said Monday, five days before the first start of his career.
``As it gets closer to game time, I'll probably get anxious.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a little.
</P>
<P>
   How McCann handles his emotions will largely determine how he
plays, and how he plays will help determine how UCLA performs.
Here's three things to watch:
</P>
<P>
   _How's his ballhandling? Interceptions aren't the only concern.
McCann is not accustomed to getting hit or sensing the backside
pass rush. All it takes is one fumble on the 15-yard line to change
the game.
</P>
<P>
   _Is he positioning the Bruins correctly? Offensive coordinator
Al Borges signals plays from the sideline, not formations. It's
McCann's job to align the receivers, running backs and tight ends.
</P>
<P>
   Although this is difficult for fans to follow, here are two
clues: If McCann steps to the line and calls timeout, or if USC's
blitzers are coming through untouched, chances are the Bruins are
misaligned.
</P>
<P>
   _Is McCann making plays? It could be as obvious as a well-thrown
touchdown pass or subtle as a 2-yard run to preserve a drive.
Either way, he must do something to help the Bruins score against
an athletic and aggressive USC defense.
</P>
<P>
   Big picture: How important is the game to McCann's future, and
to Cory Paus' hold on the starting job?
</P>
<P>
   ``If (McCann) really performs well, he probably would have the
inside track,'' coach Bob Toledo said. ``If he struggles, we'll
probably open it up and let them compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Snap, crackle, fumble? UCLA will start its fourth-string center
today, senior Jim Ghezzi. Until last week, when he replaced the
injured Matt Phelan, Ghezzi had not snapped the ball since high
school career. (That explains the two fumbled snaps against
Washington.)
</P>
<P>
   Ghezzi worked with McCann all week, but Toledo is worried about
them executing under pressure. As a result, the Bruins might use
more shotgun formation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's room for error in the shotgun,'' Toledo said. ``When
the guy is under your fanny, sometimes the quarterbck can pull out
early, or (the center) doesn't put the ball where you want. It's a
lot more difficult with a guy underneath you.''
</P>
<P>
   Stat of the day: The Bruins have jumped to a first-quarter lead
in three of the last four games played at the Coliseum. The only
time they didn't have an advantage, in 1997, the teams were tied
14-14 at the end of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Frosh foes: One of the afternoon's most intriguing matchups is
UCLA's true freshman cornerback Ricky Manning Jr., against USC's
true freshman receiver, Kareem Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   They met at an all-star game last summer and ``became cool,''
according to Manning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we went to the same school, we'd definitely be friends,''
Manning said. ``But when we first went against each other in
practice, I was talking a lot of smack. He probably took it the
wrong way. But we had a deep discussion about bringing out the best
in each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Familiar ground: UCLA sophomore linebacker Ryan Nece will play
his first game on the same Coliseum turf his father, Ronnie Lott,
roamed with the Trojans and Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up going to games there,'' Nece said. ``I remember when
my dad was with the Raiders and they played the 49ers (Lott's
former team). He was so intense. It was such a big game for him.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally: Ten games down, one to go, and UCLA receiver
Freddie Mitchell does not have a touchdown.

INVESTIGATION FOCUSES ON CENTER POLE IN BONFIRE COLLAPSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By COLLEEN McCAIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Investigators are focusing on a
splintered and cracked 100-foot center pole as they try to
determine why the towering log framework for Texas A&AMP;M's
traditional bonfire collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven people died and 28 were injured in the accident Thursday
morning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The death toll rose to 12 when Tim Kerlee Jr. of Bartlett,
Tenn., died of his injuries Friday. Two students remained in
critical condition Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   After the last bodies were recovered about 2 a.m. Friday, crews
cleared the logs and fenced off the site.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M President Ray Bowen said the school will take the lead
in the investigation and will form a task force of engineers and
experts.
</P>
<P>
   One student who was working on the tiered log tower said the
stack seemed to be leaning slightly just before it collapsed. He
was thrown from his perch atop the first tier.
</P>
<P>
   ``One side seemed to have more weight on it,'' said Paul
Alexander Jones, a freshman who suffered minor injuries. ``I'm not
sure how that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Uneven weight distribution is one possible explanation for the
collapse, said Benjamin Kelley, dean of Baylor University's school
of engineering and computer sciences in Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question in my mind that one side of the pole was
loaded more than the other,'' Kelley said. ``Once it's not
balanced, it's like getting caught in an avalanche.''
</P>
<P>
   The engineering involved in building the multilayered stack is
complex, Kelley said. Variations in the sizes and shapes of the
logs could make it difficult to load weight evenly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Texas A&AMP;M engineering professors Friday were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Notebooks detailing specific engineering instructions for
assembling the stack are passed down from each generation of
student leaders who direct the project. Professional engineers do
not oversee their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like an apprenticeship,'' said Rusty Thompson,
the university's bonfire adviser. ``You learn the trade from the
one above you on a person-to-person basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, as the campus mourned the dead and held vigils at two
hospitals for the injured, sympathy poured in from around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush took a moment to honor the victims
before delivering a foreign policy address in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that you would join me in a moment of silence to
ask God's blessings for those whose lives were affected at Texas
A&AMP;M University,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Karen Hughes said that Bush had asked A&AMP;M officials
whether they thought it would be better for him to cancel his
speech and return to Texas. She said the officials responded that
``it was a chaotic time'' on campus and that there was no need for
Bush to visit immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The White House issued a statement from President Clinton, who
spoke with Bowen on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a heartbreaking loss,'' Clinton said. ``America stands
with the College Station community as it joins together during this
difficult time. Hillary and I offer our thoughts and prayers to the
families and friends of those who were injured or killed in this
devastating incident.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials have said the investigation will initially
focus on the spliced-together center pole, which is made of two
logs held together with bolts, steel plates, glue and steel cable.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said that cracks appear above and below the joint of
the center pole, but that it is unclear whether the cracks caused
the stack's collapse or resulted from it.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
said they don't have jurisdiction over a public university but will
investigate whether a privately contracted crane operator violated
any regulations while working on the stack.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, debate rages over whether the 90-year-old bonfire
tradition should end. Bowen said the university will not make that
decision until the investigation is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the students at the site took proper precautions to
ensure safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no horseplay. This was very serious stuff because we
knew what could happen,'' Jones said. ``Everything appeared safe
from my perspective, or I would not have climbed up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Before beginning work on the weekslong project, Jones attended a
cutting practice to learn how to chop down trees and properly pick
up logs. Assembling the stack was learned on the job, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that ensuring students' safety during such a complex
project is nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Wilson, a Texas A&AMP;M biology professor, said the university
should not sanction the bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't much supervision,'' Wilson said. ``The problem
here is responsibility. The university needs to remove itself from
its current position of responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson argues that the bonfire causes serious environmental harm
by taking thousands of trees each year. He maintains a Web site
that is highly critical of the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   A 1990 report issued by a faculty-student committee at the
university acknowledged a need for additional precautions and
called for downsizing the 55-foot structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of this attention to safety, accidents continue to
occur,'' the report says. ``An even more comprehensive safety plan
is needed, one that concentrates both on preventing accidents and
reducing the severity of injury when an accident occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   A few vocal critics of the bonfire have surfaced in recent
years, but Stephen Daniel, professor of philosophy, said most have
said little about safety.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel, who served as faculty adviser for the now-defunct
student group Aggies Against Bonfire, said most opponents
criticized the cutting of thousands of trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody thought there would be a safety issue
with the stack because the university has done a marvelous job with
that aspect of it,'' Daniel said. ``This question of safety came
completely out of the blue.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Remembering Bonfire _ and becoming an Aggie
 &HT;    By Scott McCabe
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ This wasn't the way I wanted to show off
Aggie Bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   For a year now, I've bugged my friends here to fly back home to
Texas, to my birthplace of College Station, to witness what has to
be the greatest college tradition anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   I've bored them with stories about how 70,000 Aggies and friends
circle the massive structure of logs, stacked upright like a
six-layered wedding cake and topped perfectly with an outhouse
painted the color of our rival, burnt orange.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Bonfire symbolizes our burning desire to beat the
hell out of the University of Texas. But that's a bunch of bull.
Bonfire is about becoming an Aggie.
</P>
<P>
   At first, I hated it.
</P>
<P>
   I was a freshman, or fish, in the Corps of Cadets, the
2,000-student strong military organization charged with keeping our
strange traditions alive. We lived in 16 dorms in a corner of the
campus known as the Quad, where each day began with a 6:30 a.m.
formation. We attended class in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   I was bald and confused. I was trying to keep up with the Corps'
quirky traditions; trying to survive the push ups and the runs;
trying to go to classes at Texas A&AMP;M; trying to make sure none of
our fish buddies lagged.
</P>
<P>
   Building a 65-foot bonfire out of 7,000 logs was the last thing
I wanted. But I didn't have a choice. Anyone can volunteer for
Bonfire, but the Corps must serve.
</P>
<P>
   The first morning, upperclassmen woke us at 5 a.m., banging on
doors with axe handles. That was in early October. The seven fish
in our outfit, Squadron 3, had two tasks: Bring the Swisher Sweet
cigars and prepare skits to entertain the upperclassmen during
chow.
</P>
<P>
   In the freezing, rainy morning, we drove an hour to the cutting
site in the back of our fish buddy's pickup truck, protected only
by an oily tarp.
</P>
<P>
   Squadron 3 was a loading outfit. After other students _ using
only axes, not chainsaws _ cut trees in the East Texas piney woods
and others hauled the logs out of the forest with tractors, we
loaded them onto 18-wheeler flatbeds.
</P>
<P>
   We lined up, usually 20 strong, on both sides of the log. To an
upperclassman's cadence, we cursed the Longhorns as we bent down,
raised the log to our waists, then shoulders and heaved it onto the
flatbed as the guys on the inside ducked under.
</P>
<P>
   I've never heard a scream like the time an upperclassman on the
inside caught his head between the flatbed and a 50-man log. With
the log half on the truck and still on a few shoulders, we were
able to regain control of the log and a man's life.
</P>
<P>
   I hated the inside. In November was Push, the week before
Bonfire when everyone wears hardhats called pots and stacks logs.
My outfit always worked midnight to 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   In my junior and senior years I was allowed to hang in the
swings on the outside of the stack to wire the logs together.
Squadron 3 was performing the same task Thursday morning when 11
died. None, though, were from my old squadron, its commander said
Friday in an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   I dreaded building Bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   But now I remember that morning ride, the noon skits and working
the inside. I remember push-ups after one skit poked fun at the
sophomores' girlfriends. I remember getting revenge by pelting the
sophomores with pieces of a rotten pumpkin. I remember more
pushups.
</P>
<P>
   I remember my buddies in the Corps.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Bonfire great is it gives that to even those not in
the Corps.
</P>
<P>
   I also remember my younger brother, Kevin, one midnight in
November of his freshman year, my sophomore year. Kevin wasn't in
the Corps, but he was walking alone through the Quad.
</P>
<P>
   He was on his way to stack logs with his buddies.

 &HT;    Florida match-up: `It's all in front of us'
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ There has been grumbling in Tallahassee
about top-ranked Florida State, which either trailed or was tied at
the half in three of its past five games.
</P>
<P>
   There has been even greater concern in Gatorland after No. 3
Florida lost to Alabama, then looked vulnerable in its past five
games.
</P>
<P>
   Florida coach Steve Spurrier has a message for all those FSU and
UF fans who have fretted and worried and pouted about their team's
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't be in any better position today if they'd beaten
everyone 50-0, and we couldn't be in better position if we'd beaten
everyone 50-0,'' Spurrier said. ``It's all in front of us. What
happens from here on out is what everybody will remember.''
</P>
<P>
   And that starts at 3:30 p.m. today in the Swamp, when two of the
top three teams this decade _ Nebraska is the other _ meet with the
usual high stakes. In four of the past six years, the winner of
this game has played for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs a playoff system? In 1996, even the loser reached the
title game when Florida beat the Seminoles 52-20 in a Sugar Bowl
rematch to earn the school's only national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Same applies this year: If FSU (10-0) wins, it earns an
automatic berth in the Jan. 4 Sugar Bowl to play for the national
title; Florida (9-1) needs a victory today, then a win in the Dec.
4 SEC Championship Game, to taste Sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what this series is meaning now,'' FSU coach Bobby
Bowden said. ``This one right now (decides) who goes, who gets the
trip.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles are favored by a field goal because they appear to
have an edge at the most critical position: quarterback. Chris
Weinke has thrown for 2,840 yards and 24 touchdowns, including six
scores last week against Maryland. But he has never taken a snap in
this rivalry, missing FSU's 23-12 victory last season with a neck
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hands down, this is the biggest game of my career,'' Weinke
said.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier will start the game with the alternating-quarterbacks
system he used to upset FSU two years ago. Doug Johnson, benched
just a week ago, will take the first snap, Jesse Palmer the second
and then Spurrier eventually will go with the passer with the hot
hand.
</P>
<P>
   But before we read too much into the quarterback matchup,
however, remember FSU won last year with Marcus Outzen completing
13 passes for 167 yards. Bowden also remembers the last time
Spurrier tag-teamed him at quarterback with Johnson and Noah
Brindise leading the 32-29 upset in '97.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever takes the snaps for the Gators has to show improvement.
Florida has thrown just four touchdown passes in the past five
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to be firing,'' said Johnson, ``or it's
going to be a long night.''
</P>
<P>
   And a longer off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators' best resource might not be a player, but the
home-field advantage. Only once in this decade has the visiting
team won this series (in 1993, when FSU won 33-21 en route to its
only national title). Florida's five-year home winning streak was
snapped by the 40-39 overtime loss to Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still the Swamp and I know our fans are going to be
ready,'' said Florida defensive end Alex Brown. ``We will be,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   This game almost always hinges on big plays. Warrick provided
them last year, catching a pass that deflected off safety Marquand
Manuel's hands for a 32-yard touchdown, then throwing a 46-yard
score to Ron Dugans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warrick is going to make his plays,'' UF defensive coordinator
Jon Hoke said. ``What I'm concerned about is trying to get to Point
A before they can get the ball to Point B.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoke's point? Look for the Gators, especially Brown, to come
after Weinke. Florida State defensive coordinator Mickey Andrews,
by comparison, is expected to continue with last year's successful
strategy of using eight defensive backs in passing situations.
</P>
<P>
   So much is at stake today, but the players and coaches insist it
doesn't matter. Even if they had lost all their games by 50-0
scores, this would still remain a bitter rivalry for one simple
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your alumni want you to win this game more than anything,''
Bowden said.

TAYLOR WILL GET EXTENSION FROM KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In 1997, when Dave Taylor took over the hockey
operations of the club he played with for 17 seasons, the Kings
hadn't been to the playoffs in four seasons and the glitz of the
Gretzky days was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Three seasons later, the Kings are off to one of their best
starts and they've been near or atop the NHL most of the last
month. And Taylor, the club's senior vice president/general
manager, is about to ink a three-year contract extension to remain
with the Kings. The deal will have an option for a fourth year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing left to do is sign it,'' Taylor said. ``I like
the direction of the organization and I like working for this
ownership and with (Kings president) Tim Leiweke.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing keeping the deal from being signed Friday or this
weekend is Leiweke's duties with the Los Angeles Galaxy of the
Major League Soccer. Leiweke left for Foxboro, Mass., Friday to
watch the Galaxy play for the MLS championship Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that an agreement was reached between Taylor and the
Kings isn't stunning. If not for the opening of Staples Center and
the hullabaloo that surrounded the Kings moving from the Forum, the
two sides would have talked about it long ago.
</P>
<P>
   In his first season as general manager, the Kings reached the
playoffs for the first time since 1993, only to get swept by St.
Louis in the first round. Taylor fired coach Larry Robinson after a
last-place finish in the Pacific Division last season, and hired
Andy Murray as coach.
</P>
<P>
   In the offseason, Taylor also orchestrated the trade that
brought Ziggy Palffy to Los Angeles from the New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy rests: With Luc Robitaille out, without question more
pressure has fallen to Palffy. He's played a bundle of minutes so
Murray gave Palffy the day off from practice. It's similar to what
Murray's done with Rob Blake.
</P>
<P>
   With Robitaille and Jozef Stumpel not close to returning, the
Kings need more scoring from Palffy. The problem is the 27-year-old
isn't comfortable flicking shot after shot at the net.
</P>
<P>
   In 21 games this season, Palffy has nine goals on 44 shots. In
his career, he scores once every 6.3 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to see him shoot more,'' Murray said, ``but it's
tough to tell a guy who's that kind of player how to play. He sees
things other players don't see.''
</P>
<P>
   Burning the eyes: Although the Kings are coming off a 3-2 loss
to Phoenix and trying to avoid losing back-to-back games for the
first time this season, Murray expects the Montreal Canadiens to be
in a bit more nasty of a mood. The Canadiens are coming off an
inexplicable 6-1 loss to second-year Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be real ugly,'' Murray said. ``The Montreal
Canadiens losing 6-1. I wouldn't want to read the papers up there.
I don't expect it will be a real pretty game.''

RHODES IS CONSIDERING 4-YEAR CONTRACT OFFER FROM YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JACK CURRY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur Rhodes is deciding among contract proposals from the
Yankees and five other teams and could make up his mind by early
next week, according to the pitcher's agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have offered the left-hander a four-year deal to be
a middle reliever. That would give them a stellar lefty tandem in
the bullpen with Rhodes and Mike Stanton, who is expected to sign a
three-year deal for about $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Horwits, Rhodes' agent, said the 30-year-old-pitcher had
also received four-year offers from five other teams. Rhodes, who
has pitched for the Orioles for his entire seven-year career,
wanted a four-year contract to remain with Baltimore. A Baltimore
official said the Orioles were still holding steady on a three-year
proposal to Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   Horwits said Rhodes was getting close to making a decision, but
Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, did not sound hopeful
that Rhodes would decide by early next week. If the Yankees do not
sign Rhodes, they will pursue Allen Watson, another left-hander,
with more vigor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until something is completed with Rhodes, we'll continue to
talk,'' Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
   Horwits said one of the main factors that Rhodes is considering
is the proximity of the team to a home he recently acquired in
Baltimore. But Horwits also conceded that the allure of pitching
for the Yankees, the two-time defending World Series champions, is
powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very big issue,'' Horwits said. ``He's been in the
playoffs and he wants to get back. Clearly, I think the Yankees
look appealing to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Yankee Kenny Rogers might become a former Met, but
Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said it was premature to
suggest that the left-hander's career with the team was over.
Rogers, who ended the Mets' season by issuing a bases-loaded walk
to Atlanta's Andruw Jones in Game 6 of the National League
Championship Series, is seeking a four-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't made an offer to Kenny Rogers,'' Phillips said.
``My position is we'll wait and see where that market goes before
we make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   While Phillips said re-signing John Olerud is a priority, it
seems more likely that he will sign with Seattle and leave the Mets
searching for a first baseman like David Segui, a free agent.
Phillips has spoken to Scott Boras, Segui's agent, but he would not
characterize the depth of the discussions.

<P>
   CARROLLTON, Texas _ Even before he entered Texas A&AMP;M as a
freshman this fall, Michael Ebanks was an Aggie at heart.
</P>
<P>
   The Newman Smith High School graduate often talked about the
storied history of the College Station campus, and he longed to
partake in cherished traditions such as the annual bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He very much wanted to be involved in every tradition,'' said
his best friend, Matt Shomer.
</P>
<P>
   Ebanks, 19, was killed as he lived out that dream, crushed
beneath a pile of logs along with 11 others when something went
awry as the bonfire framework was assembled. Ebanks was one of the
last students pulled from beneath the log pile early Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Ebanks' older brother, Keith, a Texas A&AMP;M graduate, was killed
in a car accident five years ago, said Shomer's father, Ivan. Their
parents, Gerald and Bulinda, also have a married daughter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once is a nightmare for any parents,'' Ivan Shomer said. ``To
have it happen twice ... I don't know how they could face two.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebanks' parents drove to College Station on Thursday night and
are expected to return Saturday, a family friend said.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Shomer, 19, who attends the University of North Texas in
Denton and whose family lives next door to the Ebanks family, said
that the Carrollton community is deeply grieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you can do is pray,'' he said. ``He's in a better place.
My thoughts are with the family. You should never outlive your
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Shomer reminisced about his best friend, recalling that one of
their favorite times was a weeklong camping trip in Canada this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to make people laugh,'' Shomer said. ``He liked to be
the center of attention. He loved to brighten any situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Shomer remembered Ebanks as a self-assured teen who wasn't
afraid to take on anything, whether it was getting his pilot's
license before his high school diploma or fixing a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael was a great kid,'' he said. ``He was enthusiastic,
very friendly, very people-oriented. He had a strong belief in his
ability to accomplish things. He would tackle any job.''
</P>
<P>
   At Newman Smith, where Ebanks graduated in May in the top third
of his class, flags flew at half-staff and students collected $700
for a memorial in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   Photos of Ebanks show a tall, good-looking teen who always
seemed to have a smile on his face. Principal Lee Alvoid said
Ebanks once went through the identification photo line several
times because he didn't like the way his photo came out.
</P>
<P>
   One photo shows Ebanks with his blond hair dyed in the school's
green and gold colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was kind of quiet, but funny,'' Alvoid said. ``He had a
real dry sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ebanks was serious about his studies, giving up golf after
two years to concentrate on honors and advanced placement classes,
Alvoid said.
</P>
<P>
   During his senior year, his retail marketing project won first
place in state competition and advanced to national competition,
Alvoid said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at all his strengths ... it's just such wasted
potential,'' she said. ``But he also died doing something he loved.
It was such a dream and goal of his to be an Aggie, and he died in
that service.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebanks' funeral is 10 a.m. Monday at St. Catherine of Siena
Catholic Church in Carrollton, a Fort Worth suburb. A vigil will be
at 7 p.m. Saturday at Rhoton Funeral Home in Carrollton.

MEDIATOR IN MICROSOFT CASE KNOWN AS WIDE-RANGING THINKER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ind., Wis.)  (With MICROSOFT-MEDIATOR) 
(mk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a federal appeals court judge, Richard Posner
has an exalted job, but one held by a few hundred others. But to a
wide swath of intellectuals, he is one of the most fascinating
thinkers in the nation, especially on contemporary American social
issues.
</P>
<P>
   While most federal judges rarely engage in public comment about
subjects outside their courtrooms, Posner has produced more than 30
books on a breathtakingly broad variety of subjects, including
sexuality, aging, the economics of AIDS and literary criticism.
Most recently, he produced a crisp legal and intellectual analysis
of the investigation and impeachment of President Clinton in which
he did not shrink from concluding that the president had committed
perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   But Posner's principal field, if one must be selected from the
wide span of his work, is the intersection of law and economics.
Before he joined the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where he is
now the chief judge, he was a law professor at the University of
Chicago. On the campus where the Chicago School of economic thought
revered the free market, he played a leading role in establishing a
field of legal thought on the same foundation. It held that most
legal issues can be subjected to rational quantitative reasoning,
often in the form of cost-benefit analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Chicago School argue that by elevating the value
of increasing economic efficiency, the thinking is inevitably
without compassion and often cruel.
</P>
<P>
   Within the field of law and economics, Posner has devoted an
enormous amount of time to writing and thinking about antitrust
law, the very area in which he has taken on a major role as
mediator of any settlement talks in the Microsoft case.
</P>
<P>
   While at the University of Chicago, Posner produced a treatise
on antitrust law in 1976 in which he projected the general
libertarian skepticism over the way antitrust laws were enforced.
In the book, he argues for a narrow view of antitrust law in which
the best candidates for regulation are hard-core examples of
price-fixing by corporate coalitions or cartels and mergers that
would obviously stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft situation, in which a single company comes to
dominate an industry, does not neatly fit into either of those
categories. But as a judge and a thinker, Posner has shown himself
to be brazenly unpredictable on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Posner is one of the most important antitrust scholars
of the past half-century,'' said professor William Kovacic of the
George Washington University Law School, himself a leading
antitrust scholar.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kovacic said that although Posner's overall approach to economic
issues suggests he would be sympathetic to Microsoft, that might
not be the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fascinating choice,'' he said. ``Because if Richard
Posner tells the government it will lose on appeal or Microsoft
that it will lose on appeal, that judgment will come with an
enormous amount of credibility.'' Posner, he said, will be able to
dissect the issues and probabilities of the way things may turn
out, ``like no other person in this country. His views will come
with a towering reputation and a tremendous knowledge of the
history in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he was named to the federal bench in 1981 by President
Reagan, Posner augmented his professional life by helping to found
Lexecon Inc., a consulting firm that tried to put into practice the
Chicago School theories. A large portion of Lexecon's early
business when he was still a partner was advising companies as to
whether their competitive practices would run afoul of antitrust
laws.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As a judge, Posner has ruled on a few antitrust cases, with no
obvious pattern in his decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, writing for a unanimous appeals panel, Posner ruled
that it was a violation of the antitrust laws for an oil refiner to
set a cap on the price of its product that retailers could charge.
He wrote that he was obliged to rule that way in State Oil Co. vs.
Kahn because of a well-established principle of antitrust law, but
his opinion included a long argument as to why the principle was
outdated and should be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, the Supreme Court reversed the ruling, adopting
Posner's criticism of the precedent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Hospital Corp. of America sought to appeal a ruling
from the Federal Trade Commission, which had disallowed a merger.
Posner upheld the commission, in a decision that Kovacic said
demonstrated that he was not a reflexive opponent of antitrust
enforcement decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Posner wrote a ruling that his critics said
demonstrated his commitment to emphasizing economic efficiency. He
ruled that thousands of hemophiliacs who contracted HIV from a
blood-clotting medicine could not join a lawsuit against the drug
companies because such an action could ``hurl the industry into
bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Posner wrote the dissent as the 7th Circuit, by a
5-4 vote, upheld the constitutionality of laws in Illinois and
Wisconsin that criminalize a late-term abortion procedure that
opponents call ''partial birth'' abortion. Posner's minority
opinion said the laws were questionable because they were designed
only to dramatize the ugliness of abortion, not to reduce the
number of abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Allen Posner was born in New York City on Jan. 11, 1939,
the child of Max and Blanche Posner.
</P>
<P>
   Posner is the father of two grown sons, one a law professor and
one an investment banker. He and his wife, Charlene, also have
three grandchildren. In addition to family pictures in his chamber,
Posner keeps a photograph of Justice William Brennan Jr.
prominently displayed. Posner was a clerk for Brennan after
graduating from Harvard Law School in 1962, where he was first in
his class and served as president of the law review. His
undergraduate degree is from Yale, where he was an English major.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was his background in literature, he has said, that drew him
to write an account of Clinton's impeachment. In explaining why he
wrote ``An Affair of State: The Investigation, Impeachment and
Trial of President Clinton,'' he described both Mr. and Mrs.
Clinton as having produced a drama worthy of Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   The circuit court he administers covers Illinois, Indiana and
Wisconsin. In addition to his judicial duties and relentless
writing, he still carries a one-third teaching load at the
University of Chicago Law School.
</P>
<P>
   At 60, he likes to forsake the elevator every few days, he
recently told a visitor, and climb the stairs to his office on the
27th floor of the Everett Dirksen Federal Building in Chicago. This
summer, when the power was shut off in the building, he trekked up
to his office where he was one of the few people at work.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Texas _ The members of the First Baptist Church here
have been saying nearly continuous prayers for Nicole Barrett since
Wednesday, taking turns in hourlong shifts in front of a wooden
cross in a room attached to the church's gymnasium, where they sit
or kneel and ask God to grant her a speedy recovery. They have been
at it since word first spread through East Texas that their former
neighbor had been seriously injured in New York by a man who had
fractured her skull with a brick.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett, 27, a native of Athens, was attacked Tuesday
afternoon while she was walking near the intersection of 42nd
Street and Madison Avenue. It was the latest in a string of
frightening assaults on people in New York's public spaces. She was
placed on the First Baptist Church prayer list within a day, and
has been the topic of countless conversations here ever since.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Kyle Henderson, the church's senior pastor, said
that while the attack on Ms. Barrett _ especially its brutality and
unfathomable randomness _ has been a subject of intense talk, a key
element is missing from the discussion: blame for New York, where
the young woman had gone to try her prospects but where she is now
suffering from a severe brain trauma she received while merely
walking down the street.
</P>
<P>
   With her parents at her side, Ms. Barrett is at Bellevue
Hospital Center in Manhattan, where hospital officials said last
night that her condition was improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an improvement in her level of wakefulness,''
said Lorinda Klein, a hospital spokeswoman. ``They've seen movement
in all four extremities. She's opened her eyes and closed them
again. She is moving her arms and her legs; this is a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Athens is horrified, Henderson said, by what has befallen Ms.
Barrett. But few people in this city of 12,000 think that the
assault is a reflection on New York, which he said seemed no more
dangerous than many other places in America. ``I don't think that
New York really has the reputation here in the South of the way it
used to be talked about,'' he said. ``It's not a place where people
say the social fabric is breaking down. This week it happened in
New York. Next week it could be Oklahoma City. It could be Fort
Worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's words, echoed in two dozen interviews in this city
70 miles southeast of Dallas where Texas prairie gives way to
Southern forest, appear to represent a palpable swing in public
perception of the city and the dangers it holds.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, when Brian Watkins, a high school tennis champion
visiting from Utah, was stabbed and killed by muggers on a
mid-Manhattan subway platform, there was a public uproar, leading
to calls for more policing in a city that much of America thought
was out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins died after trying to defend his mother, who had been
kicked in the head. New York, it seemed, was a metaphor for urban
lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
   The assault on Ms. Barrett, however, has been met with a quiet
reaction among the people who knew the victim or her family. People
here pray for her recovery. Otherwise, the mood is restrained _ a
product, residents say, of their awareness that school and
workplace shootings have been taking place in cities large and
small, and their sense that New York has become increasingly safe
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole lot of meanness in the world, not in New York
in particular,'' said E. Herbert Gatlin Jr., a former mayor of
Athens and now director of the city's Economic Development Corp.
``In fact, when you look at the number of people in Dallas that get
shot, beat, hit and killed, I think Dallas might be meaner than New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   Athens is a quintessential small Southern city, where pecan
shells litter the sidewalks and handshakes are firm. The city's
center is a courthouse ringed by one- and two-story shops. Its past
is rich in cotton farming and brick manufacturing _ two products of
the area's dark, clay-streaked soil. Its present includes a belt of
strip malls that could be found anywhere in America, and two large
employers _ Champion Homes Inc., which makes mobile homes, and
Maxxim Medical, a surgical supplies manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Crime is not unknown in Athens. Recent federal statistics show
that the local police record 1 or 2 murders a year, and as many as
9 rapes and 33 car thefts. But residents say the overall incidence
of crime is low, and they feel safe.
</P>
<P>
   And though they shudder at its details, most Athens residents
seem to see no larger significance to the assault on Ms. Barrett
than that described by New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has
portrayed it as a random act of violence that should not sully his
city's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some Athens residents who have recently visited New
York said the attack had given them pause to reflect on how much
the city seemed to have improved from the days when it was
legendary for its drug wars and drive-by shootings. This was true
of Gatlin, who said he was startled by the city's gritty and
menacing feel 15 years ago, when he traveled to Manhattan to secure
a municipal bond, and surprised ``at how clean and well-lighted''
it was during a recent trip.
</P>
<P>
   It was also true for Sandra Abadie, youth coordinator at the
First United Methodist Church, who made her first trip to Manhattan
on Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the opera, we saw the plays, we rode on the subways and
I never felt unsafe,'' she said. ``The time I had was so fantastic,
it just changed my whole impression of what I had heard about New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   Those in Athens who had a bad impression of New York said it
stemmed from a general preference for rural areas, rather than a
belief that New York was a magnet for crime. ``I don't like large
cities in particular,'' said Daniel Rogers, family minister at the
Eastern Hills Church of Christ. ``Well, I guess I like Dallas _ in
my rear-view mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   Even among the people who know Ms. Barrett, the appeal of New
York was untarnished. Cheryl McMillan, whose daughter Misty was a
close friend of Ms. Barrett's when they grew up, stood outside
Athens High School on Thursday night and dabbed a tear. She was
deeply troubled by the thought of Ms. Barrett lying injured in a
hospital bed, but that thought did not change her sense of the
city, a place where talent finds opportunity and cultural life
thrives, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My youngest daughter is fixing to go to NYU,'' she said.
``She's an honors student all the way, in theater and literature,
and she wants to try it. ``She's fixing to go, and I won't stop
her.''

FUTURE OF A&AMP;M BONFIRE AWAITS END OF INVESTIGATION

<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Texas A&AMP;M will not make any decision on
whether to extinguish its 90-year-old annual bonfire ritual until
investigators determine why its tiered framework of logs collapsed
early Thursday, fatally injuring 12 current and former students,
University President Ray Bowen said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone wants to see the bonfire continue, but until
we have concluded our investigation and know the causes of this
tragedy, I think it will be left on the table the possibility that
it will not continue,'' Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost universally, students, campus leaders and alumni said
they want the tradition revived next year, although they
acknowledge that additional safety measurements must be taken to
prevent a recurrence of Thursday's accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dadgum it, we're the best engineers in the world. We ought to
be able to build whatever we want to build and do it safely,'' said
Scott Brady, a third generation Aggie and president of a Dallas
engineering firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We absolutely have to do a post-mortem on how it was run, the
way it was built and who supervised it so when it goes on, no one
gets hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Short of Colleyville, Texas, said the consensus among her
four brothers and sisters, all of whom attended A&AMP;M and married
Aggies, is that the bonfire should continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart, I think there's just so much benefit to it, I
hate to see it go,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many older alumni see the bonfire, and its related yell
practices and rituals, as a link to A&AMP;M's ``Old Army'' days as an
all-male military school. More recent graduates say it's a way for
Aggies, male and female, to bond with each other.
</P>
<P>
   University officials said they are aware that the overwhelming
majority of students and alumni favor keeping the bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now everyone is dealing with emotion, and all Aggies
emotionally want the bonfire to survive,'' said Bowen, who canceled
next week's bonfire lighting in wake of the deaths. ``But we need
to set aside our emotions and objectively investigate the causes of
this accident. That's why it's going to take some time for us to
reach a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Thompson, the university's bonfire advisor, met with
leaders of the project Thursday night and said most want the
tradition resumed next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all want to see it go forward, but they also want to know
what happened,'' Thompson said. ``They want answers just like
everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who has been involved since he was a student, also
hopes the bonfire returns next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I would like to see it, but I know we can't say
that for sure at this time,'' Thompson said. ``It's a big part of
my life, just like it is to a lot of Aggies, and I would hate to
see it go. But we can't say it's definitely coming back until we
know what happened and determine if there is way for it to be built
safely.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been some talk that the bonfire could move off-campus
if officials determine it is unsafe or are worried about liability
risks.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen believes Aggies will follow the university's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas A&AMP;M's culture is a little different,'' Bowen said.
``It's like a big family. Now that family may sometimes bicker or
quarrel or have disagreements, but they stick together and I think
the family will stick together on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson acknowledged that some of the more passionate of the
university's supporters might feel differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing Aggies, there might be some that would want to do
that,'' Thompson said. ``But I don't know logistically how they
would do that without the university umbrella. From getting the
timber, to obtaining permits _ I don't know what you might have to
get _ to finding a large enough piece of land to have it, the
obstacles would probably be enormous. But that doesn't mean some
Aggies wouldn't try it.''
</P>
<P>
   Student body president Will Hurd said that although students
remain in shock over the tragedy, a consensus has already formed to
keep the bonfire going.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like one of the parents of the victims said yesterday:
`What better way to honor my son than to have the bonfire each
year?' '' Hurd said. ``That is the way most students feel at this
campus. They want to find a way to make it safer, but they don't
want to see it disappear. It's part of the life blood of Texas
A&AMP;M.''

TALKS PROPOSED ON EVANGELISM DISPUTE BETWEEN JEWS AND BAPTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since late September, just after the Jewish High Holy Days, a
rather pointed exchange of letters has flowed between officials of
the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York and the Rev.
Paige Patterson, president of the Southern Baptist Convention, the
nation's largest Protestant denomination.
</P>
<P>
   The subject has been the Southern Baptists' support for
``messianic Jewish'' or ``Hebrew Christian'' groups, which assert
that one can be both Jewish and a believer in Jesus as the Messiah,
and which often use Jewish ritual objects, like skullcaps and
prayer shawls, in their services.
</P>
<P>
   The council, an umbrella body that includes about 60 Jewish
organizations, has made it clear that it opposes the use of those
objects by those groups and, in its letters to Patterson, has said
the Southern Baptist Convention, through its interest in these
groups, embraced a ``deceptive'' approach to trying to convert Jews
to Christianity. In his replies, Patterson flatly rejected the
charge that the denomination would countenance any sort of
deception in its evangelism.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there is a possibility that the debate may lead to a
face-to-face discussion between the two sides, a sort of summit
meeting on this contentious issue.
</P>
<P>
   The idea came from Patterson. He wrote the council last week,
inviting its top two officers _ president Gedale Horowitz and
executive vice president Michael Miller _ along with the presidents
of four major Jewish seminaries, to join him and two
representatives of messianic groups for a day's discussion at a
location agreeable to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Horowitz wrote back, proposing instead that the
meeting be just between Patterson and himself. ``This intimate
format will be more conducive to discussing our mutual concerns,''
he wrote, suggesting the two men have lunch at his office in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the council Friday, , Miller said those whom
Patterson had invited had discussed his proposal, but had decided
that ``it would be more fruitful to hold a one-to-one session.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson was traveling and unavailable for comment.

   Appeal for Ministry to Gays
</P>
<P>
   When the National Conference of Catholic Bishops held its annual
meeting in Washington earlier this week, an item not on the agenda
was discussion of a Vatican decision last July to direct an
American priest and nun, who had long run a ministry to gay and
lesbian Catholics, to end that work on the ground, Vatican
authorities said, that they were not sufficiently emphasizing
church teaching against homosexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, supporters of the priest, the Rev. Robert Nugent,
and the nun, Sister Jeannine Gramick, held a news conference nearby
to take issue with the Vatican directive. New Ways Ministry, the
organization in suburban Washington that Father Nugent and Sister
Gramick founded in the 1970s, announced that it had gathered 4,551
signatures on an advertisement, asking the bishops to request the
Vatican to reconsider its decision.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement spans six pages in the Nov. 19 issue of
National Catholic Reporter, an independent, liberal-leaning weekly
newspaper. Among other things, it declares that the decision
``angered, hurt and further alienated'' gay men and lesbians from
the church, while depriving the church ``of two voices of reason,
compassion and faith.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, the conference's president, Bishop Joseph Fiorenza,
said the Vatican decision was not ``an effort to diminish or
discourage ministry'' to gay men and lesbians in the church.
Furthermore, he said the bishops ``deplore as a horrible evil any
malice in speech or action against homosexual persons.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bishop defended the decision to ask Nugent and Sister
Gramick to end their ministry. ``The church has the right to expect
that those who engage in ministry in the name of the church to
teach as the church teaches,'' he said, adding that it was
``laudable'' that the two had said they would comply with the
directive.
</P>
<P>
   Impact of Immigration
</P>
<P>
   Fiorenza is also the author of a reflection on the effects of
immigration on the Roman Catholic Church in the United States, the
cover article in the current issue of America, the Jesuit magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, about one-quarter of the Catholics in the United
States trace their roots to continents other than Europe,'' he
writes. ``Most of this group are Hispanics of Latin American
background, and their presence extends from coast to coast.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest Hispanic populations, he said, are in the
archdioceses of Los Angeles, Miami and New York, and his own
diocese, Galveston-Houston.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE NETS ARE IN DIRE NEED OF INSPIRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Nets' shoot-around Friday morning had a distinctly
biblical feel. Don Casey, the team's first-year coach, evoked a
desolate image: his Nets were a lost tribe, wandering through a
wasteland of losing. The team had temporarily lost its confidence
and its direction. He spoke of the Nets' need to ``corral the
feelings of uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as much of a problem as perception: the feeling of
uncertainty,'' he said at the shoot-around, before his team faced
the Celtics on Friday night. ``In the latter part of last year, you
had a feeling that something good was going to happen. Now, the
team is struggling trying to get better, you're not quite sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine hours later, the misery continued as the Nets dropped to
1-8 with a 109-96 loss to the Celtics. The Nets turned the ball
over 17 times and never put up a serious defensive resistance.
Outside the Nets' locker room after the game, the legendary Red
Auerbach sought out Casey. ``Tough loss,'' Auerbach said. ``Keep
your chin up. You'll get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey smiled. ``Thanks, coach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' plunge is not as captivating as a Knicks plummet. If
anything, the attitude is ``same old Nets.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the team's travails intriguing is the specter of
George Steinbrenner _ the Yankees' principal owner _ barreling in,
attempting to right a ship that has been listing for years. With a
YankeeNets merger expected to be approved by Major League Baseball
within a few weeks, John Nash, the Nets' general manager, said
Steinbrenner's presence has not placed more pressure on his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really have any conscious thought of that,'' Nash
said. ``I know this business and this business is about winning.
Whether it's a player, a coach or a general manager. Anybody can be
hired and have a team go out and lose. We're paid to win games and
when you don't win games, I think you recognize that you haven't
done your job effectively. So that's the pressure. Is there any
more pressure because of one individual or another? No.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Nets, the pressure doesn't ease soon, however: they face
Philadelphia on Saturday night, then they have a brutal West Coast
swing when they will face Sacramento, Golden State, the Lakers and
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   But before Steinbrenner wades in and starts firing Nets,
Steinbrenner had better take inventory. Truth is, the Nets are not
that good. Jayson Williams has the heart of a lion but was an
overachiever who two seasons ago enjoyed a career season. Keith Van
Horn is a very good player who was victimized by the Bird syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Kittles is too fragile to hold up a franchise. Kittles is
waiting for his injured knee to be 100 percent, but the knee is not
going to be 100 percent. Meanwhile the team needs him on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to determine is, are we as good a team as we
thought we could be?'' Nash said. ``And if not, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury, the Nets' 22-year-old point guard, is the only
light in the Nets' long, dark tunnel. Marbury is brash, fiery and
confident, and for all of Casey's talk about teamwide uncertainty,
Marbury is not lost. He knows exactly where he is and doesn't like
it. When someone asked him how Van Horn can regain his confidence,
Marbury was at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really speak on that because I never lost my
confidence,'' he said. ``Whether I was playing good or playing bad,
I was still taking the same shots. Eventually, my 3 will start
dropping. If I start thinking about `Aw, man I'm not hitting those
3s,' then you stop taking them. You can't play like that _ the
season is too long, the game is a marathon. The season is a
marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, with the coaching staff's blessing, began the season
shooting like a madman. Now he has toned down the act and is trying
to get his teammates more involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's passed the ball to wide-open shooters who have been
unable to connect,'' said Nash, who added the front office would
evaluate the organization after 20 games. ``If after 20 games
you're unable to be what you thought you should be, you probably
aren't going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as they need talent, the Nets need inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Effort,'' Marbury said. ``It comes down to effort. Who wants
it more at the end of the game? Who's going to get that rebound?
Who's going to get that loose ball? Who's going to dive on the
floor when you need it? Who's going to go out and play with that
confidence? That's what it comes down to.''

CLINTONS MISSTATED RULING, ETHICS PANEL'S HEAD SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The head of the Office of Government Ethics has complained to
the White House that President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton
misstated a ruling by his office in September concerning the
mortgage for their purchase of a $1.7 million home in Chappaqua,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady and Clinton, in separate remarks, had both said
that the ethics office had reviewed a financial arrangement under
which a wealthy supporter guaranteed the $1.35 million mortgage,
and ruled that it did not violate governmental ethics regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that we've done has been passed on by the Office of
Government Ethics and has been legally approved,'' Mrs. Clinton
told reporters in September, when asked about the propriety of
Terry McAuliffe, one of the Clintons' chief fund-raisers,
guaranteeing the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen D. Potts, the director of the independent ethics
office, said that his office had ruled only on the narrower
question of whether Clinton would have to report McAuliffe's
involvement on his annual financial disclosure form. Potts said
that the narrow question was the only one that the White House
counsel's office had raised about the arrangement with McAuliffe.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons subsequently abandoned that arrangement and got a
more traditional mortgage that did not require McAuliffe's help.
</P>
<P>
   The letter from Potts to Beth Nolan, the White House counsel,
was dated Oct. 8 and obtained by ABC News under a freedom of
information request. A story based on the letter was posted on the
ABC News Web site Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president's and Mrs. Clinton's statements were
accurately quoted by the press, they could give the impression that
the Clintons accepted the loan guarantee because OGE said its
acceptance was not a problem,'' Potts wrote Ms. Nolan. ``We do not
know who `legally approved' acceptance of the loan guarantee or who
advised that the loan guarantee `was not a gift.' We do know that
it was not OGE.''
</P>
<P>
   Potts said that he had warned the White House about that
interpretation after first reading Mrs. Clinton's remarks in
mid-September. But, he said, he subsequently saw Clinton quoted in
The Washington Post saying that he took the loan only after
receiving assurances from OGE that the loan guarantee ``did not
constitute a gift under federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the White House counsel's office, Jim Kennedy,
acknowledged Friday that it had only asked the ethics office
whether Clinton needed to report the arrangement on his financial
disclosure form, though Kennedy noted that from the start, the
Clintons had disclosed McAuliffe's role.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The counsel's office had narrowed the inquiry it sent to the
ethics office, Kennedy said, because it had determined that there
were no other legal issues in the arrangement that required outside
review.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also said that his office had accurately portrayed the
response it got from Potts' office. ``In no way was there any
effort to mischaracterize our dealings with OGE,'' he said.
``Throughout this process, we have tried to be clear about that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy demurred when asked about the Clintons' more
expansive description of the opinion in their remarks to reporters.
``I wasn't there,'' he said. ``I don't know the exact question
asked. I don't know the full context of the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons came under fire for the arrangement by, among other
people, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is likely to be Mrs. Clinton's
Republican opponent in next year's race for the U.S. Senate.

RUNNING ATTACKS WILL DECIDE USC-UCLA GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forget penalties, injuries and turnovers.
Disregard the quarterback clash. Home-field advantage? Irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   When UCLA and USC play today for the 69th time, the outcome will
hinge on one facet of play: the running game. Not nerves, not
mistakes, not special teams _ the running game. It's been the key
to UCLA's eight-game series winning streak, and it's the key again
today.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight games, UCLA has averaged 190.8 yards rushing. USC
has averaged 118.5.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have outrushed the Trojans in seven of the eight
games, the exception being 1992, when UCLA walk-on quarterback John
Barnes threw for 385 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have rushed for at least 200 yards four times during
their winning streak. The Trojans have never rushed for 200 yards
during their losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have averaged 4.4 yards per carry. The Trojans have
averaged 3.4.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's heroes, in most cases, have been its tailbacks. Kevin
Williams gained 131 yards in the '91 game, while Ricky Davis ran
for 153 in '93. Sharmon Shah (now Karim Abdul-Jabbar) rumbled for
135 yards in '94. Skip Hicks had 116 in the '96 thriller, including
a 25-yard touchdown in overtime. Last year, freshman DeShaun Foster
rushed for 109 and scored four touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Efficiency is more important than the yardage itself. It won't
do the Bruins much good if Foster runs 30 times and struggles for
80 yards. But if he gains 5 or 6 yards a carry _ last year, he
averaged 7.2 _ it'll give UCLA's battered offensive line an
enormous psychological lift.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you run the football, it's all about being physical and
having heart,'' UCLA receiver Danny Farmer said. ``Each year, we
come out wanting to be physical with them. We definitely put more
emphasis on being physical against USC than anyone else. We stress
it all week in practice and in the games.''
</P>
<P>
   The running game is more important this year than any other
because of the quarterback situation: USC's John Fox started the
season as a linebacker and has thrown 71 passes; UCLA's Ryan McCann
was the fourth-stringer a month ago and has thrown just 34. Neither
team wants to rely on its unproven quarterback to make game-winning
plays _ the kind Cade McNown used to make, the kind Carson Palmer
could have made.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true of UCLA, since McCann is a redshirt
freshman who has never faced USC. Meanwhile, Fox is a fifth-year
senior who started for USC in the '97 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a new quarterback, and he's going to be nervous,
especially with it being USC,'' Bruins center Jim Ghezzi said.
``The one thing we can do as a line is dominate the running game
and ease him into the game. It's going to be integral.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the best way to ease a quarterback's burden. Usually, a
consistent running game means fewer third-and-10s and more
third-and-3s. That gives the offense the option to run or pass and
keeps the defense guessing. When the linebackers are wary of the
run, they think twice before blitzing. When the safeties have to
provide run support, it leaves the cornerbacks in man-to-man
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Considering each team will start a true freshman cornerback
(Ricky Manning Jr. for UCLA; Darrell Rideaux for USC) and given the
talent at receiver, neither team wants to rely on man-to-man
coverage. It'd be easy pickings for both quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a receiver, you can definitely tell if the team's running
poorly by the way the defense plays against the pass,'' Farmer
said. ``But if the safeties and the outside linebackers have to
look to the run, that opens up the passing game.''
</P>
<P>
   Can UCLA repeat its running success with a makeshift,
injury-depleted offensive line?
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, the Trojans will stack eight men on the line of
scrimmage, stuff the run, and dare McCann to beat them through the
air. Why let Foster win the game _ he did it last year, after all _
when they can force McCann to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't run, then you become one-dimensional,'' Bruins
coach Bob Toledo said. ``Particularly with a rookie quarterback,
(it's important). Otherwise, you're asking him to win the game. . .
. We can't get into a passing contest.''

 &HT;    Coping in College Station
 &HT;    By Jason Spencer

<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ With seven of their sons and classmates
resting Friday night in hospital beds, some clinging to life, the
parents and friends of those who survived their fall from the
tumbling Aggie bonfire stack considered themselves the lucky ones.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll from Thursday morning's bonfire collapse at Texas
A&AMP;M University stood at 12 Friday night. Throughout the day,
students and parents shrugged off their need for sleep and stood
vigil at the town's two hospitals, hoping for good news.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday night, four students remained in critical
condition, according to university officials.
</P>
<P>
   One student injured when the wooden structure gave way was in
guarded condition, while the other two were in fair condition, A&AMP;M
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of the hospitalized students spoke Friday about the
horror they faced upon learning their children were among those
mangled by the wood heap that fell with as many as 70 students
working on the stack.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Davis of Bellaire called the accident ``a parent's worst
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son William, a 20-year-old sophomore, was in critical
condition with a punctured lung, broken ribs and facial bones and a
liver injury, doctors said. Davis floats into and out of
consciousness and is hooked up to a respirator to help him breathe,
his doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a number of logging injuries in Louisiana, and
they're always terrible,'' Dr. Frank Castro said. ``He is
exceptionally fortunate to have survived, given the nature of his
injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   As a member of A&AMP;M's Howdy spirit organization, Davis was
spending his only night at the bonfire when it fell Thursday,
killing his partner, Miranda Adams, his mother said. He does not
know that many of his classmates died in the accident, Cheryl Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the fall and amid the chaos that ensued, William
Davis was more worried about his friends than himself, said his
father, Howard Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the guys that was with him told me yesterday that even
though Bill was hurt, he kept telling him to go help others,'' he
said. ``I think it's just typical of the spirit of A&AMP;M.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hutchison's 19-year-old son Chad also was in critical
condition Friday with several broken bones and internal injuries.
Hutchinson learned of the accident Thursday morning and arrived at
his son's side a few hours later to hear him recount the details of
the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew my son was on that stack. He's a crew leader. He said
he heard the loudest pop he's ever heard in his life. He began to
fall and he said he was lucky he fell on the side away from the
falling logs,'' Hutchinson said. ``He asked me two questions. He
said, 'What happened?' and I told him. The second thing he asked
is, 'Did anybody die?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hutchinson defended the bonfire tradition and the safety
precautions students like his son take in the hopes of preventing
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very well trained. They're highly educated, highly
involved students. He takes his job extremely serious,'' Hutchinson
said. ``There is no hanky-panky going on up there (on the stacks).
It's seriously hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many A&AMP;M students, Chad Hutchinson does not want to see the
bonfire tradition end, despite the deaths and injuries, his father
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son, from his bedside, wants the bonfire to burn,'' he
said. ``He's willing to rebuild it, even in his present
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Several students wondered at the outpouring of support from
across the country, and especially the support that came from their
rival University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked about how UT is handling this. They canceled their
Hex Rally and darkened their tower. I look at them in a totally
different way now,'' said Jon Rigels, a 19-year-old member of the
Corps of Cadets.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, Rigels, who is trained in first aid, rushed to
the bonfire site to help the injured Aggies. ``It's sad it took a
tragedy for the two schools to come together.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M officials met with student leaders Friday to come up with a
way to maintain the upcoming week's traditions and still honor the
students who died building the bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the day of the Elephant Walk, in which seniors
typically join hands at Kyle Field and walk to the bonfire site,
those students will walk through campus, past the pile of fallen
logs and back to the stadium, said Elizabeth McKee, the student
body's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday, the night bonfire is traditionally burned,
students instead will meet at Kyle Field for yell practice, McKee
said. The yell practice, however, will be altered to omit one of
A&AMP;M's most cherished sayings, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no 'Beat the hell outta TU' out of respect for
what they've done for us,'' McKee said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress completed its work on the budget Friday
night, ending a year of political gridlock and breaking, for the
second consecutive year, the spending limits that lawmakers set for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate sent President Clinton the last spending bills in a
budget that includes $17 billion more for the military and $2.3
billion more for medical research than last year, both of which
were sought by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The budget frees money to pay $351 million of the $926 million
in back dues to the United Nations and offers 41 of the world's
poorest countries some relief from their debts, which President
Clinton fought for over the Republicans' objections.
</P>
<P>
   And after 10 days of intense negotiations, the budget also gives
Clinton most of the money he wanted for hiring primary school
teachers and local police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's final passage Friday night of five spending bills
totaling about $386 billion came on a 74-24 vote, and without
debate. Forty-two Republicans and 32 Democrats voted for the
measure. Twelve Democrats and 12 Republicans voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   With this vote approving the last major legislation that
Congress will handle before adjourning this year, the lawmakers
completed the last piece of a budget for federal agencies totaling
about $610 billion, 50 days after the new fiscal year began Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office said Friday night that it was
still calculating the budget's bottom line. But it is roughly $30
billion more than last year and $30 billion beyond the spending
limits for this year imposed by law in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The omnibus spending package of five spending bills that passed
Friday night also contains a last-minute across the board spending
cut negotiated by the White House and the Republican leaders in
Congress. It requires federal agencies to cut 38 cents out of every
$100 in their budgets, yielding about $1.3 billion for the 2000
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the spending cut, the budget would require using about
$15 billion from the Social Security surplus, according to the most
recent figures available from the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans claim, however, that the budget does not touch
the retirement reserves, and they have made a political slogan out
of their stance on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the claim rests on a variety of accounting devices. Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla., characterized them as ``an avalanche of budget
gimmickry,'' on the Senate floor Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if tax revenues exceed expectations this year, the claim
might in fact turn out to be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the final assessment is made next May, we'll know for
sure,'' the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were there some budget processes used this year that affected
the bottom line's appearance?'' Lott asked. ``Yeah. Was that new?
No.''
</P>
<P>
   The final budget package approved Friday night by the Senate
includes these five bills in one:
</P>
<P>
   _ A $315 billion measure for the Departments of Health and Human
Services, Labor and Education. Of that sum, $229 billion was for
mandatory programs like Medicare and Medicaid, while the remaining
$86 billion was for programs like medical research, special
education and job training.
</P>
<P>
   _ A $39 billion measure for the Commerce, Justice and State
Departments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two $15 billion bills, one for the Interior Department, one
for foreign aid, as well as a fifth bill that includes $429 million
for the District of Columbia and $576 million in emergency
assistance for flood victims of Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Republican senator, John McCain of Arizona, a
candidate for his party's presidential nomination, had said all
week that he would vote against the budget package because it was
``riddled with gimmicks and pork.'' McCain, despite his long years
in Congress, has been running as a maverick and Washington
outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, as the Senate held up the roll call for missing
senators who had anticipated a much later vote, McCain, out of
breath, raced onto the Senate floor, fresh off a plane from a book
tour promoting his autobiography, to vote against the omnibus
budget bill. The roughly $610 billion in spending for federal
agencies represents slightly more than one-third of the overall
federal budget, which is $1.75 trillion. Most of the rest of the
money goes for mandatory programs like interest on the government's
debt, Medicare and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The final budget package also contained a measure that lets
satellite companies broadcast local network affiliates _ channels
carrying local news, sports, weather and other programs _ j as
their rivals in the cable television business do.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also gave final congressional approval to legislation
extending a variety of expired tax breaks, including one that gives
companies a tax credit for their research and development expenses.
The tax benefits add up to $18.3 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The tax bill contained two unrelated measures. One expands
Medicare and Medicaid so that disabled people can return to work
without losing their health benefits. The other would delay for
three months new federal rules on how human organs are distributed
for transplants. The purpose of the delay is to give Congress time
next year to overturn the rules if it chooses to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate separately approved a new law intended to change the
ways sweepstakes companies can entice people to buy magazines and
other goods with promises of winning large cash prizes.
</P>
<P>
   It says companies like Publishers Clearing House cannot send
letters saying someone is ``a winner'' unless they really have won
something. The companies must also clearly inform people that their
chances of winning a prize do not increase if they buy something.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted on the budget bill after a long filibuster by
Midwestern senators over milk legislation evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Herb Kohl, D-Wis., they argued against extending the life
of a milk producers' cartel in Northeastern states, which they say
hurts dairy farmers in their states.
</P>
<P>
   They threatened to block the final budget package and to keep
the Senate in session around the clock, with tactics including
reading aloud from cookbook recipes containing cheese. But they
backed down after Lott promised that the Senate would consider the
issue next year.
</P>
<P>
   As the senators finished voting and after a round of handshakes,
backslapping and, among Democrats, a few high-fives, the chamber
slowly emptied out and fell silent.

   BRYAN, Texas _ When Cheryl Davis learned early Thursday that her
son was among the Texas A&AMP;M students injured when a bonfire log
stack collapsed, she had no great cause to worry.
</P>
<P>
   She had been told that 20-year-old William, a sophomore from
Houston, suffered only a broken arm.
</P>
<P>
   His elbow was, in fact, broken. But when Davis arrived at St.
Joseph Regional Health Center in Bryan, she learned that her son
also had broken bones in his hip, pelvis, legs and face. He also
suffered minor liver injuries, several cracked ribs and a punctured
lung.
</P>
<P>
   Although William Davis was in critical condition Friday and on a
respirator, doctors expect him to recover fully.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surgeon said, `You don't know how lucky your son is,' ''
Cheryl Davis said during a news briefing at the hospital, about
five miles from the A&AMP;M campus. ``Considering he has tubes going
out of his body in every direction and numerous broken bones, I
guess he is.''
</P>
<P>
   William Davis has not been told that 11 fellow Aggies died in
the accident and that 27 others were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll rose to 12 when Tim Kerlee of Germantown, Tenn.,
died of his injuries Friday. John Comstock of Richardson, Texas,
was in intensive care at College Station Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The scene inside and outside St. Joseph was tense Friday as
students and parents gathered and visited the injured. For some,
the enormity of the accident was just beginning to sink in.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Shelton of Corsicana, Texas, said the tragedy hit him like
a punch in the belly. Lucas Kimmel, a freshman in Shelton's outfit
in the A&AMP;M Corps of Cadets, was among those killed. And William
Davis is among Shelton's closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two days ago, I was in the hallway talking to Lucas, going to
class with Lucas, going to chow with Lucas. Now he's gone,''
Shelton said as he kept vigil at St. Joseph. ``It's hard. Lucas is
gone, and Davis is hurt real bad in ICU.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, 18, and the throngs of fellow students and Aggie
parents assembled at St. Joseph took comfort in their numbers. The
tragedy has forged an even tighter bond for members of the
close-knit, tradition-bound A&AMP;M family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really unbelievable what's going on up there,'' said
Heather Sustman, a senior from the Houston suburb of Spring.
``People who don't even know each other are giving out hugs and
just being there for them. It's really quiet, but we are all
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Gloria Hutchinson, whose son, Chad, was among those
upgraded from critical to serious condition, are aware of the
prayers and warm wishes extended by what the couple described as
``the Aggie family.''
</P>
<P>
   Chad Hutchinson, a 19-year-old sophomore from Houston, was
working on the highest stack and crashed about 50 feet among the
tumbling logs. His parents said he recalled hearing the ``loudest
pop he's ever heard in his life,'' just before the logs collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hutchinson said his son was alert and concerned about the
other Aggies who had been working in around-the-clock shifts to
build the bonfire framework. The structure was to be set ablaze
Thanksgiving night, the eve of A&AMP;M's annual football game against
the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I visited him for the first time at 8:20 a.m. (Thursday),
he asked, `What happened? Did anybody die?' '' Bill Hutchinson
said. ``I explained to him that, yes, there were some deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   His son took the grim news ``very hard,'' Hutchinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Msgr. John Malinowski, St. Joseph's chaplain, said the people
pulling for the injured survivors are demonstrating a brand of
faith that most Sunday sermons can't match.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Texas A&AMP;M, they are very faith-oriented, and they are not
bashful about showing it,'' Malinowski said. ``That is their
strength, and I do not believe it is wavering.''

   KELLER, Texas _ In silence, 10 students encircled the flagpole
at Keller High School on Friday morning to begin a prayer vigil in
memory of Chad Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, the 1999 Keller High School valedictorian, was among 12
people fatally injured early Thursday when a towering log stack
collapsed at Texas A&AMP;M University. The students were building the
framework for the annual A&AMP;M bonfire, the highlight of preparations
for the Aggies' annual football game against archrival University
of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Keller residents tried to come to grips with the
community's loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 45 minutes, I'd estimate there were between 800 and 1,000
students around the flagpole,'' said Julie Zwahr, Keller school
district spokeswoman. ``Without saying anything, students would
simply walk up to the circle, drop their books and join hands with
the others.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was time to go to class, staff members quietly ushered
students inside, Zwahr said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the prayer vigil was conducted in silence, a community
gathering Friday night at First Baptist Church of Keller was for
people to ``process and communicate'' their feelings, said J.D.
Tomlin, student minister for the church. Powell, 19, was a First
Baptist member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, it will give a sense of God's presence through this
difficult circumstance,'' Tomlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Powell would have encouraged people to seek God's comfort during
troubled times, Tomlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he embraced his relationship with Christ was evidenced
by the way he lived his life and the way he treated others,''
Tomlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Powell distinguished himself in high school as president of the
National Honor Society and winner of numerous honors.
</P>
<P>
   Adam McGilvray said he watched Powell grow and develop during
high school and came to value his friendship. McGilvray, the
technical media specialist for the district's communications
department, said Powell was Keller High School's ``computer guru.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Powell connected because of their interest in technology
and because Powell continuously volunteered his time at the school,
McGilvray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always remember how he could put his mind to something
and make it happen,'' McGilvray said. ``If he got it in his mind to
do it, or if he needed to do it for someone else, he would do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services for Powell will be at 10 a.m. Monday at Harvest
Baptist Church, 7200 Denton Highway in Watauga, Texas. Burial will
be at Bourland Cemetery in Keller.
</P>
<P>
   The family asked that those who would like to honor Powell make
a contribution to the Chad Powell Memorial Fund at Frost Bank in
Keller. The funds will be used to build a chapel in Bridgeport,
Texas, at the Sid Richardson Scout Reservation for the Boy Scouts
of America.
</P>
<P>
   The Powell family asked that the news media not attend funeral
services or Friday night's community gathering, Zwahr said.

A MAGAZINE EXECUTIVE'S PUZZLING DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Subs to relay police statement in 2nd graf, and to clarify
suicide method and location of hospital in 15th graf)

 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kimberly Smith Jensen was known as a tough,
occasionally stubborn, boss around the offices of Mortimer B.
Zuckerman's publishing empire. In August, she had been promoted to
chief operating officer, overseeing three magazines. The
44-year-old executive, whose passion outside the office was rock
and country music, had been with the company for 15 years, playing
a key role in developing the business plan for Fast Company,
Zuckerman's fastest-growing magazine. And she was regarded as a
trustworthy manager.
</P>
<P>
   That is why her undoing is all the more mysterious. On Nov. 4,
Zuckerman and his management asked Ms. Jensen, who oversaw
management at Fast Company, The Atlantic Monthly and U.S. News and
World Report to explain what they said were missing funds under her
authority, says Ira Ellenthal, the chief executive and group
publisher for the magazines. Nine days later, she was found by a
housekeeper in a Comfort Inn in Ocean City, Md., a plastic bag tied
over her head. In a state- ment the Ocean City police said her
death was an apparent suicide. The police report said Ms. Jensen
appeared to have been dead for at least 24 hours when her body was
discovered at 12:45 p.m. on Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Ellenthal said Thomas Peck, the company's chief financial
officer, believed Ms. Jensen had siphoned substantial amounts of
money to cover personal expenses like rent and credit-card bills
and to finance a tour of a rock band she represented.
</P>
<P>
   Ellenthal did not say how much money was involved, but The Wall
Street Journal, which published an article on Friday about Ms.
Jensen's death and the investigation into it, reported that the sum
was in the tens of thousands of dollars. Ms. Jensen's annual salary
was about $250,000, another executive at Zuckerman's company said.
Peck did not return a phone call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jensen was married to Steven Fuchs, a computer specialist
who worked at a ski resort in Killington, Vt. He called the office
on Monday, Nov. 8, saying that his wife had been hospitalized after
a car accident and would not be coming to work. On Nov. 10,
Ellenthal said, Fuchs told her colleagues at work that she had
returned to her home in New York. Fuchs reported her missing to the
police on Nov. 11, two days before her body was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Before her latest promotion, Ms. Jensen had been the general
manager of Fast Company and The Atlantic Monthly, which Zuckerman
sold in September. Both have headquarters in Boston. Ms. Jensen
divided her time among Boston, New York and Killington.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a trusted person and key to The Atlantic long before
she became key to Fast Company,'' Ellenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   William Whitworth, the former editor in chief of The Atlantic
Monthly, said Ms. Jensen had thrived on work and was always
extremely busy. ``I got the impression that she had too much to do,
but sought that,'' Whitworth said. ``She liked running things.''
</P>
<P>
   She also loved rock and country music. Ms. Jensen tried to
advance the careers of a rock band based near her home in
Killington. With her backing, the band, Genghis Angus, did a
10-week cross-country tour in the fall of 1998, playing at venues
from Boston to Chicago to San Francisco to Boulder, Colo.,
according to Guy Burlage, the lead guitarist.
</P>
<P>
   Burlage said Friday, ``In no way shape or form was this any kind
of extravagant tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends said Ms. Jensen and her husband lived on a wooded
two-acre plot near the Killington ski resort, in a home built for
them by a local architect.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Ewald, a local attorney who handled the land sale for the
couple and the owner of a WEBK, a radio station that featured the
kind of artists Ms. Jensen supported, said in an interview Friday:
``She didn't have an extravagant lifestyle. She was a very normal,
down-to-earth person.''
</P>
<P>
   She had recently begun serving as the manager for Jeff Black, a
singer- songwriter who performed in Killington on Nov. 6, two days
after her meeting with Peck. The next day, she drove Black to the
airport in Providence, R.I., according to Louise Coogan, who also
manages musicians and worked with Ms. Jensen in her efforts to find
a label willing to feature Black's work.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jensen ``was working very hard at trying to get him a record
deal,'' Ewald said.
</P>
<P>
   After she dropped Black off at the Providence airport, Ms.
Coogan said, Ms. Jensen drove into the city and attempted suicide
by inhaling exhaust fumes from her car. The Ocean City police
confirmed this account, and said she was taken to a Rhode Island
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Kitselman, the leader of Genghis Angus, said Friday that
the band was paid through Ms. Jensen's music management companies,
Adrenachrome Records and Straightaway Artist Management. He added
that he found it ``unfathomable'' that she would ever ``skim money
off anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was absolutely the most ethical business person I'd ever
worked with,'' Kitselman said. ``It is totally unfathomable that
she would take money from the magazine'' to support the group.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jensen's husband, Fuchs, did not return phone calls Friday.

STUDENT WOULD HAVE APPROVED CORNEA DONATION, FAMILY SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Resending to reflect 12th death) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF PRINCE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Friends and relatives will be thrilled if the
person who receives Jerry Don Self's corneas has half his inner
vision and a tenth of his positive outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Self, 20, was among 12 people fatally injured when a bonfire log
stack fell Thursday at Texas A&AMP;M University. He was a junior
engineering student, a member of the Corps of Cadets and a mentor
to church youth.
</P>
<P>
   His family is donating his corneas and skin. Other organs were
not suitable for transplant, a family spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Self would want any usable part of his body to go to someone
else, said his brother, Michael Self, 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was any way to help another person, he would find
it,'' he said. ``He always wanted to help.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend has established a Web site in Jerry Don Self's honor.
People can post their memories at www.lamarvikings.com/tribute
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I'll get a lot of response, just so everybody can
read it and remember Jerry, and also I can print it out and give it
to his parents,'' said Chris Mycoskie, a Lamar High School graduate
who attends the University of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Beau Riley said he could fill the Web site by himself. He met
Self at Shackelford Junior High School in 1994, and the two became
close friends over the years.
</P>
<P>
   They made an odd duo.
</P>
<P>
   Riley excelled in sports. He played quarterback at Lamar High in
Arlington and is a sophomore quarterback at Howard Payne University
in Brownwood, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Self exhibited more desire than ability, Riley said. In Riley's
old football videos, Self can be seen on the sidelines, jumping,
yelling and waving his arms, showing more enthusiasm than anyone on
the field or in the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   The gangly Self saw limited playing time, but he stuck with
football and eventually started a few games before graduating in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Riley had long hair. Self's hair was high and tight. When Riley
got an earring, Self told him to ``rip it out,'' Riley said,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were so different, but they were alike in their values,''
said Riley's mother, Debbie Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Self spent so much time at the Riley house that he had his own
room and kept clothes there, the family said. He let himself in
through a back door that the Rileys kept unlocked just for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew what was in the refrigerator better than I did,''
Debbie Riley said. ``He was a like a son to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Self would strike up conversations with anybody, which Beau
Riley said amazed him. Once, they were in a convenience store at
midnight waiting to pay for snacks when a surly man walked in
wearing sunglasses and apparently looking for trouble, Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Self was reading a tabloid magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saying to myself, `Jerry, don't say anything to this
guy,' '' Riley recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Self began chuckling over a story about an ``alien kidnapping''
and showed the article to the tough guy, Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting for the guy to hit Jerry, but the guy started
laughing,'' he said. ``Jerry was about the most personable guy
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The two left for different colleges in 1997 and saw less of each
other. But they met during holidays and breaks, and the talk flowed
like old times.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said that Self's enthusiasm had only grown since he
enrolled at Texas A&AMP;M. The cadet was carrying a full load of
classes, holding two part-time jobs, helping a family in need and
working with youth at church.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was putting in overtime, doing all this for everybody,''
Riley said. ``God just called him home for early retirement. I
don't blame him. I'd want him on my team, too.''

USC, UCLA GET READY TO BUMBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So you think (begin ital)anything(end ital) can
happen when UCLA and USC get together? Throw the stat sheets out
the window and all that?
</P>
<P>
   Cut the cliches. I think we all know exactly what will happen
when these losers get together today at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)First quarter:(end ital) The Trojans, who haven't
beaten their crosstown rivals since 1990, win the coin toss and
elect to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins achieve a UCLA-USC ``first'' by getting their opening
kickoff blocked.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans achieve a UCLA-USC ``first'' of their own by getting
penalized for jumping offside before blocking the kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   After a second kick, the Trojans quickly drive to the 5-yard
line, and John Fox throws a touchdown pass to Windrell Hayes. USC
leads, 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins quarterback Ryan McCann and center James Ghezzi, each
starting his first game, mess up their first snap and the Trojans
recover the loose ball.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Chad Morton runs untouched for a 34-yard touchdown. USC
leads, 14-0.
</P>
<P>
   On the USC sideline, Morton can't help reminding teammates that
he guaranteed the Trojans would beat the Bruins this year and his
prediction is looking pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)Second quarter:(end ital) R. Jay Soward hasn't
caught a pass yet. USC fans chant ``R. Jay! R. Jay!''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett decides to call a play for Soward, but
can't find the receiver on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Soward is finally spotted behind the bench, leading fans
chanting ``R. Jay! R. Jay!''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the game, Soward takes a short pass from Fox and turns
it into a 79-yard touchdown. USC leads, 21-0.
</P>
<P>
   On the USC sideline, Morton, emboldened by the apparent accuracy
of his guarantee, predicts the Cincinnati Bengals will win the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries continue to eat away at the Bruins as broken
collarbones sideline the entire offensive line. Five-foot-9 punter
Nate Fikse is now playing tackle.
</P>
<P>
   When Fikse clears a hole with a crushing block, and DeShaun
Foster runs 63 yards for a UCLA touchdown to make it 21-7, an
ominous feeling of (begin ital)deja vu(end ital) washes over the
pro-USC crowd.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)Third quarter:(end ital) ABC discovers that only one
Nielsen household is watching the regionally televised game _ and
that ``household'' consists of a basset hound who accidentally
steps on the remote's power button while his owners are out.
</P>
<P>
   The network makes an emergency change in the announcers' booth,
replacing Charlie Jones and Dan Fouts with Regis Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA faces fourth-and-short at midfield, and coach Bob Toledo
signals ``go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that your final answer?'' asks a voice from above.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins make the first down and score on a McCann-to-Danny
Farmer pass, cutting the deficit to 21-14.
</P>
<P>
   On the USC sideline, Morton, still feeling good about his
guarantee, predicts Louie Anderson will win the 1,500 meters in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)Fourth quarter:(end ital) Fox is sacked for a short
loss on a third-down play where USC is caught holding, drawing its
25th flag of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins must decide whether to accept or decline the penalty.
They ask Regis if they can use their ``50-50'' lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   They decline the penalty and the Trojans punt.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins forge a 21-21 tie on a 12-yard run by Jermaine Lewis
with 6:34 on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   After the Trojans go three-and-out, the Bruins ride their
momentum to a go-ahead field goal with three minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   But the Trojans surge through the Bruins' injury-depleted
defense, Morton going over the 150-yard mark on the way to a
game-tying, 30-yard field goal by David Newbury at the gun.
</P>
<P>
   On the USC sideline, Morton, not beaten yet, predicts Pat
Buchanan will be elected president in 2000 thanks to a late surge
in donations by space aliens.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)Overtime:(end ital) By now injuries have claimed
UCLA's entire defensive lineup except for safety Joey Strycula.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans take advantage of the 11-on-1 situation by marching
all the way to the UCLA 3. They kick a field goal to grab a 27-24
lead.
</P>
<P>
   A PA announcement: ``Will the owners of automobiles with license
plates bearing the words `UCLA,' `Bruins' or any variation thereof,
please report to Coliseum security. You are parked illegally and
will be towed.''
</P>
<P>
   There goes the rest of UCLA's offensive team except for McCann.
</P>
<P>
   As McCann prepares to hike the ball to himself, USC fans believe
victory over UCLA is inevitable and begin celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   But USC's defense, confused by UCLA's single-man formation, lets
McCann sprint into the end zone and catch a 25-yard touchdown pass
from himself.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA escapes with an improbable ninth consecutive victory over
USC.
</P>
<P>
   Morton is spotted at an exit, handing out tickets to the
Louisiana Tech game. &QL;

 &HT;    Texas A&AMP;M president promises probe into toppled bonfire that
killed 12
 &HT;    By Laylan Copelin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Texas A&AMP;M President Ray Bowen promised
Friday an independent investigation into the cause of the collapsed
Aggie Bonfire, saying the university needed outside help to
maintain its credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation ``could not be led by someone that would be
perceived, rightly or wrongly, somehow protective of our
interest,'' said Bowen, who earlier suggested Texas A&AMP;M would
conduct the investigation itself.
</P>
<P>
   As the university received prayers and condolences from around
the country, a 12th student, Tim Kerlee of Bartlett, Tenn., died at
8 p.m. Friday at St. Joseph Regional Health Center. His family was
at his bedside. Four students remained in critical condition in
local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are with them heart and soul,'' Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen said the investigation wouldn't begin officially until
next week, but early attention focused on the bonfire's center
pole, the primary support for what was to be a 55-foot bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Thompson, the faculty bonfire adviser, said the center
pole was snapped in two or three places. Although some of the 70
students on the bonfire stack reported hearing a sharp crack,
Thompson said he still believes the center pole cracked as the
entire pile toppled. Thompson was not at the scene when the crash
occurred but he said he formed his opinion after talking to student
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen did not say who would lead the investigation, although he
said the individual would need to understand higher education,
government and big business as well as the legal, technical and
political issues involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe a former university president,'' Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would not tackle the make-up of the investigation
task force until next week, in what he said he hopes will be a
calmer climate.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday, A&AMP;M announced it had hired a company to test the
soil at the accident site. Buchanan Soil Mechanics Inc. began
taking samples Friday in case rain hit the area.
</P>
<P>
   As the last of the logs were cleared Friday and set aside as
evidence, Bowen also raised the possibility that there will be no
more bonfires after 90 years of using the blazes to mark the
football game against the University of Texas Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen said he had heard many Aggies express a desire for the
tradition to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's in the heart of everybody,'' he said. ``But at
this point of time, not understanding exactly what happened, it
would be best if we sort of left out on the table the possibility
after a full analysis we'll have to make the hard decision that
this would be the last bonfire.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's bonfire has been canceled. As university officials
began to consider the fate of future bonfires, Texas A&AMP;M released
documents that shed some light on bonfire-related injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The incomplete reports show that more students typically are
injured where the trees are cut than where the bonfire is built.
</P>
<P>
   From 1991 through 1994, 41 to 49 students reported injuries at
the cut site. Injuries at the bonfire stack ranged from seven to
27. The injuries range from heat exhaustion to the most common
injury, cutting a foot with an ax.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries, according to the reports, dropped in recent years.
From 1996 through 1998, 17 to 20 students were hurt where the trees
are cut. During that same period, the reports show one to nine
being hurt at the bonfire stack.
</P>
<P>
   Each year the reports evaluate the bonfire safety. In 1997, it
was suggested that the safety harness system used by students
stacking wood should be improved. In 1998, the evaluation reported
too many injuries due to horseplay. The reports do not indicate
what, if any, changes were made.
</P>
<P>
   Officials on Friday dealt with continued rumors about the cause
of the tragedy, and began assessing how to determine it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have all the answers to the questions,'' Bowen said.
``We're still dealing with the shock.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M officials said the video camera that provided real-time
images of the construction of the bonfire on the university's Web
site did not record the collapse. They asked anyone who might have
copied that image or eyewitnesses who might have taken photographs
or video to contact them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be important information,'' Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:25 a.m. Friday morning, almost 24 hours to the minute from
the collapse, the last of the tree trunks and smaller logs were
cleared and stacked on the polo field. Workers were fencing the
site Friday to protect the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, were at the site Friday, but only to look into the
actions of crane operators.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Brantley, the Austin area director of OSHA, said his agency
is involved only because private contractors, the crane operators,
were working at the bonfire site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to look at the operation of the crane, its rigging
and its actions,'' Brantley said. ``How many students were on an
unstable stack of wood is not our jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Brantley said he had heard the rumor that the crane hit the
stack and toppled it, but the investigation has not determined
anything yet.
</P>
<P>
   The center pole is expected to be the focus of any
investigation. The pole is actually two pine poles that are spliced
together. It is then buried 15 feet into the ground and stands 85
feet high during construction. The top of the pole was to be
sheared off when construction was complete.
</P>
<P>
   To splice the two poles, 4-foot joints are cut in each, then
they are bolted together. Thompson said 700 feet of 3/4 inch steel
cable is wrapped eight to 10 feet above and below the splice.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the damage to the center pole, which is 3 to 4
feet in diameter, was above and below where the pole is spliced
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The splice was intact,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pulleys and ropes are attached to the pole and used to lift the
logs onto the six layers of the bonfire stack. There were four
layers at the time of the collapse. Most of the fatalities,
officials said, appeared to be the people working on the higher
stacks.
</P>
<P>
   Experts, including structural engineers, also are expected to
investigate the size of the logs, the system of using bailing wire
to wrap each log to others, and other construction methods
developed over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no blueprint as such,'' Thompson said. ``The Aggie
Bonfire is really hand-down tradition from generation to
generation. There's a lot of on-the-job training. It's almost like
an apprenticeship.''
</P>
<P>
   While the crane operators are professionals and Thompson is a
faculty adviser, almost all of the other work _ from felling the
cedar and oak trees to building the stack _ is organized, managed
and overseen by students. Only four of the eventual six layers of
logs had been assembled when it toppled without warning.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation also will focus on the training and management
of the work.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who has been faculty bonfire adviser since 1990,
denied rumors that students were horseplaying at the time of the
collapse or that a crane hit the stack.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that the bonfire stack did not fall apart as it
toppled to one side. He said the heavy, redundant wire wrappings
kept the stack mostly intact: ``It didn't just fall apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson echoed the opinions of many others: ``As a former
student I'd hate to see the tradition die.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``I definitely don't want to do this again without
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time the bonfire stack has collapsed or
safety questions have been raised.
</P>
<P>
   The stack fell in 1957 and 1994. The latter, which did not
seriously injure anyone, was blamed on saturated ground from heavy
rains. Thompson said that after the investigation, lime was added
to the base to harden the ground, but the construction methods were
not changed.
</P>
<P>
   The university has not finalized plans for observances or
memorials next week, including at the football game Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, President Clinton called Bowen on Friday to
offer his condolences.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, in California for his first foreign policy
speech, opened his remarks by asking for a moment of silence ``to
ask God's blessings on those whose lives were affected at Texas
A&AMP;M.'' Spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Bush had called the university
on Thursday to ask if he should return to Texas instead of giving
Friday's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``They indicated that they felt that it was a chaotic time on
the campus and they appreciated his concern but that there really
was no reason for him to return home,'' said Hughes. ``He would
like to attend a memorial service if he is able to do so, depending
on when it is scheduled.''

   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ A Texas A&AMP;M University sophomore died
Friday night of injuries he suffered when a towering bonfire
framework collapsed Thursday, bringing the death toll in the
accident to 12.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Kerlee, a 17-year-old from Germantown, Tenn., had been in
critical condition at St. Joseph Regional Health Center since the
accident. The other 11 victims died at the bonfire site on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators plan to focus on a splintered and cracked 100-foot
center pole as they try to determine why stacks of logs for A&AMP;M's
traditional bonfire collapsed. Twenty-seven others were injured in
the accident, and two remained in critical condition Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M President Ray Bowen said the school will take the lead
in the investigation and will form a task force of engineers and
experts.
</P>
<P>
   One student who was working on the tiered log tower said the
stack seemed to be leaning slightly just before it collapsed. He
was thrown from his perch atop the first tier.
</P>
<P>
   ``One side seemed to have more weight on it,'' said Paul
Alexander Jones, a freshman who suffered minor injuries. ``I'm not
sure how that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Uneven weight distribution is one possible explanation for the
collapse, said Benjamin Kelley, dean of Baylor University's school
of engineering and computer sciences in Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question in my mind that one side of the pole was
loaded more than the other,'' Kelley said. ``Once it's not
balanced, it's like getting caught in an avalanche.''
</P>
<P>
   The engineering involved in building the multilayered stack is
complex, Kelley said. Variations in the sizes and shapes of the
logs could make it difficult to load weight evenly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Texas A&AMP;M engineering professors Friday were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Notebooks detailing specific engineering instructions for
assembling the stack are passed down from each generation of
student leaders who direct the project. Professional engineers do
not oversee their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like an apprenticeship,'' said Rusty Thompson,
the university's bonfire adviser. ``You learn the trade from the
one above you on a person-to-person basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, as the campus mourned the dead and held vigils at two
hospitals for the injured, sympathy poured in from around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush took a moment to honor the victims
before delivering a foreign policy address in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that you would join me in a moment of silence to
ask God's blessings for those whose lives were affected at Texas
A&AMP;M University,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Karen Hughes said that Bush had asked A&AMP;M officials
whether they thought it would be better for him to cancel his
speech and return to Texas. She said the officials responded that
``it was a chaotic time'' on campus and that there was no need for
Bush to visit immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The White House issued a statement from President Clinton, who
spoke with Bowen on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a heartbreaking loss,'' Clinton said. ``America stands
with the College Station community as it joins together during this
difficult time. Hillary and I offer our thoughts and prayers to the
families and friends of those who were injured or killed in this
devastating incident.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials have said the investigation will initially
focus on the spliced-together center pole, which is made of two
logs held together with bolts, steel plates, glue and steel cable.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said that cracks appear above and below the joint of
the center pole, but that it is unclear whether the cracks caused
the stack's collapse or resulted from it.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
said they don't have jurisdiction over a public university but will
investigate whether a privately contracted crane operator violated
any regulations while working on the stack.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, debate rages over whether the 90-year-old bonfire
tradition should end. Bowen said the university will not make that
decision until the investigation is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the students at the site took proper precautions to
ensure safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no horseplay. This was very serious stuff because we
knew what could happen,'' Jones said. ``Everything appeared safe
from my perspective, or I would not have climbed up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Before beginning work on the weekslong project, Jones attended a
cutting practice to learn how to chop down trees and properly pick
up logs. Assembling the stack was learned on the job, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that ensuring students' safety during such a complex
project is nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Wilson, a Texas A&AMP;M biology professor, said the university
should not sanction the bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't much supervision,'' Wilson said. ``The problem
here is responsibility. The university needs to remove itself from
its current position of responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson argues that the bonfire causes serious environmental harm
by taking thousands of trees each year. He maintains a Web site
that is highly critical of the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   A 1990 report issued by a faculty-student committee at the
university acknowledged a need for additional precautions and
called for downsizing the 55-foot structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of this attention to safety, accidents continue to
occur,'' the report says. ``An even more comprehensive safety plan
is needed, one that concentrates both on preventing accidents and
reducing the severity of injury when an accident occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   A few vocal critics of the bonfire have surfaced in recent
years, but Stephen Daniel, professor of philosophy, said most have
said little about safety.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel, who served as faculty adviser for the now-defunct
student group Aggies Against Bonfire, said most opponents
criticized the cutting of thousands of trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody thought there would be a safety issue
with the stack because the university has done a marvelous job with
that aspect of it,'' Daniel said. ``This question of safety came
completely out of the blue.'' &QL;

STAGGERED AND HIGHER TOLLS PROPOSED FOR NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Tolls on the New Jersey Turnpike would rise
significantly for the first time in a decade, but motorists who use
the E-ZPass system or avoid the peak hours would receive discounts,
under a proposed capital program to be announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The new toll structure, if adopted, would constitute the largest
introduction yet of what is known as congestion pricing, in which
rush-hour road space is treated as a scarce commodity and priced
accordingly, state and federal transportation officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed toll increases would pay over five years for $900
million in construction along the 118-mile highway. Under the plan,
which must be examined at public hearings and approved by Gov.
Christie Whitman before it takes effect, the Turnpike Authority
would raise tolls by an average of 10 percent in 2001 and then
again in 2003. The authority now generates about $350 million in
annual toll revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists who continue to pay cash would face the steepest
increases, 20 percent in 2001 and 17 percent in 2003. Drivers who
use the E-ZPass system, which after several delays is now scheduled
to begin operation on the turnpike in late May, would face
increases of no more than 8 percent and 10 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Those E-ZPass users who drive the turnpike on weekdays but not
during the peak hours of 7 to 9 a.m. and 5 to 7 p.m., however,
would see no fare increase at all in 2001 and only a 5 percent
increase in 2003. Weekend tolls would be the same as during weekday
rush hours.
</P>
<P>
   The authority is scheduled to present the plan, details of which
were first reported in The Star-Ledger and The Record of
Hackensack, on Tuesday. A spokeswoman for the Turnpike Authority,
Lynn M. Fleeger, declined to comment on it Friday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A few New Jersey Democrats assailed the proposed toll increases
Friday. One, Assemblyman Charles Zisa of Hackensack, warned it
could ``turn eastern Bergen County into a parking lot'' if
commuters felt compelled to use local roads to save money.
</P>
<P>
   But the state transportation commissioner, James Weinstein, said
the Turnpike Authority could make a strong case for the toll
increases, the first since 1991, when the rates for cars rose 70
percent and the tolls for trucks doubled. He noted that the
authority had bowed to political pressure and dropped a toll
increase scheduled for 1995, cutting costs instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has always made it clear that toll increases were
a last resort, and that before she would countenance a toll
increase, she had to be convinced the agency had tightened its
belt, and done everything possible to avoid it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, advocates for drivers accustomed to jeering at toll
increases greeted the proposal with some enthusiasm. Pam Fisher, a
lobbyist for the New Jersey Automobile Club, said she was cheered
to learn that the Turnpike Authority was planning to spend $140
million to improve bridges, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything we can do to get some repairs on our bridges will be
great for us,'' she said. ``If the funds are really needed, we're
not going to quibble about it.''

COMMENTARY: WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE A MILLIONAIRE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (CHANGES ``sex scandal'' to ``sexual revelations'' in 3rd graf) 
 (Editors: in 2nd graf, replace double parentheses with single
brackets, which cannot be transmitted on the wire)  
 (bl)  
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When historians look back at America as it rang in the momentous
year of 2000, what will they find? Y2K panic? An outbreak of
millennial spirituality? ``Prosperity with a purpose''?
</P>
<P>
   Guess again. What they are going to see instead is a country
drunk on a TV quiz show called ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
As the countdown to the new millennium intensifies, it is
impossible to exaggerate the appeal of ABC's nightly national
Vesuvius of greenbacks. Even in the few days since its success
landed it on the front page of The New York Times, the show's
numbers have continued to soar. ``The Virgin Mary, Arnold
Schwarzenegger, leprechauns _ nothing could stop ((Regis)) Philbin
and his mind-numbing multiple choice show,'' wrote Lisa de Moraes
in The Washington Post, chronicling the depleted ratings for such
other network sweeps stunts as the heavily promoted spectacular
``Mary, Mother of Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the ``Millionaire'' viewership huge, but in an era
of ``niche'' audiences, when every fractionalized demographic in
the nation is pandered to by its own cable channel, ``Millionaire''
is gathering Americans from all walks of life around the electronic
hearth in the way ``I Love Lucy'' once did. Low-attention-span kids
and surly teenagers watch. Parents watch. The elderly watch. Who
could imagine a happier ending to our long siege of White House
sexual revelations and workplace massacres? At last, a G-rated
cultural value that unites the entire American family _ greed!
</P>
<P>
   All brought to us by the wonderful world of Disney Co., which
has finally found a dirt-cheap entertainment formula that pleases
Wall Street without offending any major faith. If you can find a
link on the ABC Web page that doesn't lead to a ``Millionaire''
promotion, jokes veteran Hollywood agent Bernie Brillstein, ``the
site it takes you to has Walt Disney turning over in his grave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come to a tough moment at the end of the millennium,''
said Rosalyn Weinman, an NBC executive who holds a doctorate in
sociology. ``All the stuff our parents told us didn't come true. No
one cares if you're good. People only care if you're good-looking
and rich.'' Not that NBC won't try to get its share in a gold rush:
the network is shamelessly scrambling to bring back ``Twenty-One,''
its own notorious contribution to the 1950s quiz-show scandals. How
will the new ``Twenty-One'' be different from the old? I asked Fred
Silverman, who is readying the retread in Los Angeles. ``The first
thing,'' he replied, ``is that it is not going to be fixed.'' The
second: ``more accessible'' questions.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the '50s it was the young congressional investigator
Richard Goodwin, on his way to the Kennedy White House, who led
contestant Charles Van Doren, the star fraud of ``Twenty-One,''
into a Washington hearing room to confess to a disillusioned
nation. At my urging this week, Goodwin watched an episode of
``Millionaire'' and then sounded almost nostalgic for Van Doren,
who, though fed questions in advance, was at least a bona fide
egghead. Goodwin thought ``Millionaire'' was ``a joke'' and has no
use for its dumbed-down questions. ``In the '50s,'' he said, ``we
cited these contestants as examples of how we were intellectually
ahead of the Russians. The shows were designed to create heroes,
people to admire and look up to for their learning and knowledge.
Now they're trying to make audiences feel better about
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The return of the quiz-show craze in the late '90s, Goodwin
added, suggests a parallel between now and the '50s, another
prosperous ``time of dullness'' with ``really intense public apathy
and little ferment over public issues.'' And certainly ``Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire'' gains intellectual heft when compared with
the current political culture's debate over Al Gore's wardrobe. Yet
affluent as the '50s were, they are nothing next to our current
boom, which rivals the late-19th-century Gilded Age in terms of its
creation of fabulous wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain called the Gilded Age a time of ``money-lust.'' This
week terms like ``voyeurism'' and ``vicarious orgasms'' and
``ecstasy'' kept popping up when I canvassed people about the late
1990s appeal of ``Millionaire.'' In this sense, the new quiz shows
were a phenomenon waiting to happen; they're the giddiest
manifestations yet of a culture that offers a pornography of wealth
almost everywhere you look.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what's it like to be worth $400 million when you're 27
years old?'' asked Fortune in its cover story on ``The Young and
the Loaded,'' one recent example culled from the avalanche of media
celebrations of dot-com zillionaires. (Answer: darned good.) The
new Esquire features a first-person confession by an anonymous,
freshly minted millionaire exulting in his financial virility in
the same terms that men's magazines once celebrated sexual prowess.
</P>
<P>
   To up the ante on ``Millionaire'' the night of its debut this
month, ABC led into it with ``Annie,'' the musical about the
Depression-era orphan who finds happiness in the loving arms of the
eponymous Daddy Warbucks. ``The richest night of television!'' is
how the network promoted the double bill. Further gilding the
already gilded lily are the relentless commercials on
``Millionaire'' for eTrade, which not only invites viewers to play
the market but to enter a sweepstakes that will award a million to
the entrant who correctly guesses the Dow Jones average at year's
end.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   If this country is so rich, why are so many coveting prosperity
they already have? The answer is that most people don't have it,
and the gap between the haves and the have-nots _ and between the
haves and the middle class _ is growing. While nearly half the
country invests in stocks, 90 percent of the shares are held by the
wealthiest 10 percent of the households, according to studies cited
by The Wall Street Journal; meanwhile, stock options have pushed
the ratio of executive pay to factory-worker pay from 42 to 1 in
1980 to 419 to 1 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Aldrich Jr., the author of the memoir ``Old Money,'' said
the distribution of wealth among Americans now looks like ``the
pyramid on the dollar bill _ with the top sliced off and floating
up by the transparent eyeball.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans aren't angry about these discrepancies. Politicians
aren't vocal about them, with the fringe exception of Pat Buchanan
_ and Donald Trump, who last week announced a confiscatory tax plan
for the super-rich. Instead of getting riled, have-not and
have-not-so-much Americans are looking for their own financial
scores, especially quick scores. Las Vegas is our fastest-growing
city. Day trading and Internet betting are in the stratosphere.
According to this year's report by the federal commission on the
subject, the national explosion in state lotteries and casinos has
led Americans to spend far more on gambling per year than they do
on groceries. For children addicted to acquisitiveness but not old
enough to put cash on the table, there are chips, in the form of
Pokemon cards.
</P>
<P>
   In the corporate offices of television, where executives have to
worry about when today's hits will fade, there seems to be
unanimity about how the quiz-show fad could burn itself out. ``If
the economy tanks,'' says Dr. Weinman of NBC, ``the whole thing
falls apart. Then you have envy and jealousy.''
</P>
<P>
   She is seconded by the psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers, who in
1955 won a total of $134,000 on ``The $64,000 Question,'' until now
the only quiz show to top TV ratings for a season, and its
offshoot, ``The $64,000 Challenge.'' Reminiscing this week, Dr.
Brothers told of how she spent that long-ago windfall _ a Park
Avenue medical practice for her husband, dishwashers for the rest
of her family _ and also of how warmly the public responded to her
winnings. She feels that the same approval accrues to 1999's
quiz-show victors, at least for now. But in an economic downturn,
she fears, the masses will turn on overnight millionaires who got
``something for nothing'' and ``did no real work.''
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the quiz show scandals in the '50s, John
Steinbeck wrote a letter to Adlai Stevenson that The New Republic
published under the headline ``Have We Gone Soft?'' Steinbeck
wrote, ``If I wanted to destroy a nation, I would give it too much
and I would have it on its knees, miserable, greedy and sick. ...''
</P>
<P>
   But you'll find no such jeremiads here _ or almost anywhere.
Everyone loves Regis, the show is way more fun than Stone and Jane,
and only a millennial-eve party pooper could imagine that the
biggest bubble in the nation's history will ever burst.

RENO BLOCKS RELEASE OF EGYPTIAN JAILED FOR 3 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Attorney General Janet Reno Friday temporarily
blocked the scheduled release of an Egyptian man who had been
jailed for more than three years based on secret evidence, saying
she wanted to consider intervening in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Immigration Appeals, which reviews decisions of
immigration judges, had ordered that the man, Nasser K. Ahmed, be
released on bond at 5 p.m. Friday while it considered whether he
should be deported or granted political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   But Ahmed remained in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in
lower Manhattan after Doris M. Meissner, commissioner of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service, asked Ms. Reno to
intervene, citing ``national security implications,'' the INS said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general has the authority to review and overturn
decisions of the immigration courts, which are part of the Justice
Department. Ms. Reno said she would consider the matter and decide
on Tuesday whether to intervene formally and review Ahmed's case.
</P>
<P>
   It is highly unusual for the attorney general to intervene in
INS decisions, said Carole Florman, a Justice Department
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed's case has been widely watched as it is one of about 20 in
which the INS has jailed people of Arab descent using classified
evidence. The use of such evidence has been criticized by
Arab-American groups and civil libertarians as a violation of due
process.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Ahmed said Friday night that they would ask to meet
with Ms. Reno or submit papers to her arguing for Ahmed's release.

ARNOLDS STURMS, 87, COMPOSER AND MUSIC CRITIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Arnolds Sturms, a New York-based composer, flutist
and music critic, died Nov. 7 at the Isabella Geriatric Center in
upper Manhattan's Washington Heights. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Dobele, Latvia, and graduated with honors from
the State Conservatory of Music in Riga. He later played with the
Latvian National Opera Orchestra and became the chief of the flute
department at the state conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949 he moved to the United States. He studied composition
for four years at George Peabody College in Nashville with Roy
Harris and Philip Slates, moving to New York in 1953. It was not
until the late 1950s that Sturms began his active composing career.
His catalog of works include orchestra pieces, chamber music,
numerous instrumental sonatas and suites and more than 50 songs.
</P>
<P>
   His profile as a composer increased through a series of six
concerts of his works at Carnegie (later Weill) Recital Hall
between 1969 and 1989. Reviewing one of these events in 1989, a
program of violin music and songs, New York Times music critic Will
Crutchfield praised the music for its skill and elegance while
taking note of the composer's ``backward-looking idiom.''
Crutchfield wrote that Sturms ``has that sine qua non, an easy flow
of coherent musical ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Sturms also wrote reviews for more than 40 years for Laiks, a
Latvian newspaper in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Eleonora.

FORMER TEXAS A&AMP;M FACULTY SAY BASIC DESIGN FAULTY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ With campus life already shrouded in
grief, a 12th student died Friday as the attention of Texas A&AMP;M
University leaders turned toward the investigation into what caused
the collapse of the Aggie Bonfire that killed him and his comrades.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Kerlee, 17, of Bartlett, Tenn., died at 8 p.m. CST. He had
internal injuries, a crushed pelvis and broken arm, his parents had
said. Like many of the 10 young men and two young women who died,
he was an outstanding student in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Kerlee was in the top three of his graduating class at
Germantown High School in suburban Memphis, according to The
Commercial Appeal. And his parents, like so many other parents of
students killed or injured while building the Bonfire, viewed the
accident as a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   However, the investigation into the accident renewed old
questions about the safety of a tradition of building a 55-foot
tower of logs to set afire for an annual football rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the questions were raised years earlier by a few of
Texas A&AMP;M's own engineers. But their concerns were never addressed
and are shrugged off even now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dangerous. We knew it was dangerous from Day 1,'' said
Swiki Anderson, a consulting engineer who taught at A&AMP;M in the late
1970s and early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He now operates his own engineering firm in the neighboring city
of Bryan. Both he and professor emeritus Louis J. Thompson, who
retired in 1991 after 25 years, said they raised red flags over the
safety of the Aggie Bonfire _ Anderson to his department chairman
and Thompson with students involved in the 90-year-old tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kibler, assistant vice president for student affairs, said
he is unaware of any engineering faculty members voicing concerns
about the structure's design. He said he thinks it is somewhat
unfair for complaints to be voiced now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the point. If (the complaints) were raised 25
years ago ... I'm not sure there's relevance now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Requests by the Houston Chronicle for an interview with A&AMP;M
president Ray Bowen, a 1958 A&AMP;M graduate with a degree in
mechanical engineering, &UR;  &LR; were declined.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and Thompson said the basic design of the Bonfire is
flawed because it entails a relatively loose bunching of upright
logs.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, a retired civil engineer in College Station, said that
over the years he discussed the construction dangers and design
deficiencies with his students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept telling them it was dangerous,'' he said. ``What's
amazing to me is that it went on as long as it did.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Bonfire was too tall for the width of the base,
exceeding the standard set in the construction of buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at stacking children's blocks, it is very
difficult to stack more than 10 ... an aspect ratio of 10-to-1,''
Thompson said. ``The highest building in the world is not over
10-to-1, but they were trying to do that out there. They needed a
wider base.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides base width, he said, the log structure lacked the
``internal shear strength'' to guarantee its integrity. Groups of
logs were held together with wire and ``there wasn't anything tying
one side to the other.'' Shear strength is what prevents a beam
from splitting along its length when bent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very carefully done,'' Thompson said, ``but there was
just not enough strength. The edges were too steep.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson echoed Thompson's sentiments about the design, calling
the center-pole design ``stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bonfire is built using two telephone poles spliced together
and planted in the ground about 15 feet deep. Then layers of logs
are stacked in the shape of a wedding cake until a 55-foot height
is reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put a pine pole in the center and then ... lash all these
matchsticks together. ... Any engineer worth his or her salt has
known that (is stupid),'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an accident that's been waiting to happen,'' he added.
``Only by the love of God'' did it not happen sooner, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said that when he was on the faculty, he voiced his
concerns about safety to his department chairman on several
occasions, but, ``tradition dies hard at A&AMP;M, especially
90-year-old traditions, even when they're dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   He never took his complaints higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a paramilitary university like this, do you think you'd
ever do anything like that?'' he asked. ``Of course not.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his department chair, a retired brigadier general, never
forwarded the concerns to higher ranking university officials,
which Anderson said didn't surprise him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you speak out against things (at A&AMP;M), you're labeled as
a troublemaker ... As a matter of fact, you're vilified.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Thompson never voiced his concerns to anyone other
than students.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, I don't think the university had a lot to do
with the thing,'' he said. ``It was purely the students. I don't
know anybody at the university who had anything to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kibler, the A&AMP;M assistant vice president, said university
engineers, construction experts and others have advised students
over the years. However, he said he does not know when the last
time an engineer or construction expert reviewed the Bonfire
construction.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the advice was offered only when students sought
it from faculty or staff, and there are no construction blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   The exception was in 1994, when heavy rains caused the structure
to collapse, and the construction science faculty got involved.
Unlike Thursday's accident, no students were on top of the stack of
logs at the time and no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   But other than cosmetic changes, the Bonfire construction method
has remained unchanged since 1947. Students have handed down the
method over the years, said Kibler, who was Bonfire adviser from
1983-92.
</P>
<P>
   Outside engineering experts and others will be called in to help
with the university's investigation, said spokesman Lane
Stephenson. The probe will be headed by the University Police
Department, with assistance by others, although Stephenson said he
did not have a complete list of the other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   University Police Chief Bob Wiatt would not discuss the focus of
the probe. But students at the site when the logs came toppling
down Thursday said they heard a loud pop and that the center pole
had snapped.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 70 students were around and on top of the four tiers
of logs at the time.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects quick answers. ``This will be a long process, a
meticulous, thorough process,'' Stephenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the trauma of losing ten young men and two young women,
most A&AMP;M students and former students interviewed support
continuing the Bonfire, although there will not be one this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you have to be an Aggie to understand this,'' said
Stephenson, his voice choking with emotion and his eyes beginning
to tear. ``If you spent countless hours cutting down trees (and
helping erect it), you would understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he lay in serious condition with broken bones Friday in
St. Joseph Medical Center, Chad Hutchinson, an engineering
sophomore from Houston, would have returned to the Bonfire for more
work if he could, said his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's willing to go rebuild it in his present condition,'' Bill
Hutchinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Said John Slack of Colleyville, a senior member of the Aggie
Corps of Cadets: ``It would be a tragedy to discontinue the
Bonfire.''

'96 TEARS REMAIN WITH GALAXY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ There isn't much argument that the 1996
inaugural MLS championship game between the Galaxy and D.C. United
is the most memorable in the league's short history.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Pope's sudden-death goal in the 94th minute capped a
three-goal, 21-minute comeback in pouring rain to erase the
Galaxy's seemingly insurmountable 2-0 lead late in the game. It was
the perfect Hollywood ending _ except Hollywood's team didn't win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the game in hand,'' said Galaxy playmaker Mauricio
Cienfuegos. ``Those last 20 minutes? I don't want to think about
that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   United went on to win the championship again in 1997. The Galaxy
was swept in the first round that summer.
</P>
<P>
   United reached the MLS championship game last year, too. The
Galaxy was swept by Chicago in the Western Conference finals,
allowing the Fire the luxury of knocking off United in the
championship at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   For United defender Jeff Agoos, that come-from-behind victory in
'96 set the foundation for what followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It set a tradition and a standard for the players who wear
this uniform,'' said Agoos. ``We set a standard that we never give
up. No matter what happens, we're going to be out there battling
till the end.''
</P>
<P>
   So here they are again, finally.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy has its much-anticipated rematch with United, and
Sunday's game is back in Foxboro _ the place where things all fell
apart three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hurt; it was a devastating loss,'' said Galaxy
defender Greg Vanney, one of five Los Angeles players remaining
from that team. ``But we felt at the time we would get them back
the next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year turned into four years while United kept running the
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we learned is you can't take those opportunities for
granted,'' said Vanney. ``You never know if next year will ever
come. Four years isn't that long, but it felt like a very long time
to get back here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy's Cobi Jones said the '96 final is not brought up
that much, but it's on the minds of those who were there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things you try to put behind you,'' said
Jones. ``We have such a different team now. The players who were
there remember every detail and situation, and for them, there is a
bit of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is about starting a new tradition with the new guys.
For the guys who weren't part of '96, they're just here for one
thing _ a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   More than nine inches of rain fell during the 24-hour period
leading up to MLS Cup '96. By the time kickoff approached,
monsoon-like winds and continued showers left the field in puddles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a horrible day for soccer,'' remembered Jones. ``You
didn't know where the ball would end up. And with the field under
water, you couldn't dribble. It was just about kicking and
running.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm provided a lot of excitement for the 34,643 fans who
braved the conditions. The majority of them were D.C. fans who made
the dangerous drive hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real surprise was the number of people that were there,''
remembered Agoos. ``I remember waking up that morning and seeing a
monsoon. It became less of a soccer game and more of how to
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   United was the survivor that day.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Armas, the Galaxy's man-marker at the time, said the
toughest part was never knowing if he would get another chance.
Armas got his revenge as a member of the Fire last season.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time for Vanney, Jones, Cienfuegos, Jorge Salcedo and
Robin Fraser to get theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is now and there may never be another chance,'' said
Vanney. ``Especially for some of our older guys. We're looking
forward to doing it this time so we don't have to look back and
answer these questions anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Salcedo was traded the next season, but coach Sigi Schmid dealt
Danny Hernandez to Tampa Bay earlier this summer, reuniting Salcedo
with his old group.
</P>
<P>
   He wonders what would have happened had the Galaxy held on.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think about that all the time,'' said Salcedo. ``If we win
that game, we might have been the team in the final the next four
years instead of D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``But give D.C. a lot of credit. It takes a lot of character to
accomplish what they have. Dynasties have to start somewhere, and
theirs started with us.''
</P>
<P>
   At least this time, the forecast is much better. Rain is
expected Saturday night and Sunday morning, but it should be clear
by kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's hope so,'' said Cienfuegos.

SENATE PASSES FINAL BUDGET BILL FOR FISCAL 2000 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress adjourned Friday after the Senate approved
the final budget bill for the 2000 fiscal year containing $385
billion and covering seven government departments.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the spending package ended one of the most partisan
sessions in Congress' history. It began with the House impeaching
Clinton and the Senate acquitting him, and ended, ironically, with
Republicans giving him much of what he wanted in budget
negotiations, including money for paying back dues to the United
Nations, for supporting the Middle East peace process and for
hiring more teachers and police .
</P>
<P>
   The 74-24 vote on the 2,000-page spending package came after
Midwestern senators backed off a threat to keep the Senate in
session until their objections to federal dairy price controls had
been addressed in the final spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   The senators, led by Herb Kohl, D-Wis., gave up their filibuster
after Republican and Democratic leaders promised that their
concerns over pricing controls that favor northeastern milk
producers would be dealt with in legislation next year.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders also eased the way to a final vote by approving
an amendment offered by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W. Va., that would
allow coal mines to continue dumping wastes into nearby streams and
valleys in violation of court rulings until environmental impact
studies on the practice are completed. That measure was largely
symbolic, however, because it was sent back to the House where it
will not be taken up.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd was promised a chance to revive the issue when the 106th
Congress convenes again in January for its second session.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise over the dairy and mining problems was praised by
most lawmakers, primarily because it cleared the final obstacle
standing in the way of their departure for the Thanksgiving and
Christmas holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas called it ``the answer to
our prayers,'' noting that most senators did not relish the
prospect of remaining in session much longer.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote on the giant budget package negotiated by
Clinton and Republican leaders followed by one day a vote in the
House approving the measure by 296-135. Clinton will sign the bill,
which includes five spending measures, into law when he returns
from a European trip early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison joined fellow Republican Gramm
in voting for the compromise budget even though she said she had
``mixed feelings'' about it. She praised the fact that it keeps
faith with the commitment of both parties to keep the budget
balanced, and does not rely on Social Security surpluses to fund
other government programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time in more than 30 years that we've been
able to do that. I think that's a huge feat, and it was not easy,''
Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   But she blasted a provision of the bill that would make oil and
gas companies pay more in federal royalties for drilling on
government land if a compromise cannot be worked out with the
Interior Department by March.
</P>
<P>
   Although they sought to put the best face on the Congress'
performance for the year by touting their efforts to protect Social
Security and pay down the national debt, GOP leaders found it
difficult to hide their bitterness over the impeachment outcome as
they offered their year-end summations for reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., for example,
suggested that he was still irked by the position that most
Americans took last spring when they said in poll after poll that
Republicans should not have impeached Clinton over the Monica
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for the articles of impeachment, and I was
disappointed about a lot of what that whole situation said about
the American people's attitude about responsible conduct in the
office of the presidency,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said, however, that he did not think that th trial of
Clinton had left ``a lot of residual scars'' on Congress because
Republicans and Democrats were able to produce a number of
bipartisan bills, including a measure overhauling the financial
services industry and giving more flexibility to the states in how
they use federal education dollars.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., also said that progress
had been made in putting aside the ``bitterness'' of impeachment
and other partisan matters.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on the House floor Friday summing up the first
session of the 106th Congress, Hastert recalled how bad things were
when he was sworn in as speaker in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had members who would not even talk to each other, let
alone work with one another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said bipartisan efforts helped produce a number of measures
that strengthened defense, modernized the banking industry and
improved education.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Hastert both emphasized that the GOP stand against
tapping the Social Security Trust Fund this year to underwrite
other spending programs as Congress' most important accomplishment.
Lott called it ``monumental,'' noting that leaving the trust fund
alone would help provide debt relief of $120 billion to $150
billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tremendous fight to establish this precedent and get
it locked in. But we have succeeded in that, and that's going to
provide a definite restraint on the enlargement of federal spending
in the future, and it's going to be very good for the Social
Security system,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to next year, the two leaders said they hope to
take action on a bill expanding the rights of patients that belong
to health maintenance organizations, and reforms aimed at
preserving the long-term viability of Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they hoped to revive some kind of tax relief
bill. Clinton vetoed their 10-year, $792 billion tax cut proposal,
charging that it would primarily benefit the wealthy and be paid
for in part by tapping Social Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats criticized the GOP for dwelling on tax cuts this year
instead of taking action on a patients bill of rights, a
prescription drug benefit program for Medicare patients, and an
increase in the minimum wage. Polls showed that all three of those
items are favored by a majority of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also claimed that Republicans did everything they
could to block final action on campaign finance reforms and new gun
control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the gun control issue, Lott conceded that
Republicans had fought hard to stop new laws from being enacted,
and would again next year.

   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ A day after President Clinton and other
Western leaders confronted President Boris Yeltsin of Russia at a
meeting in Turkey, condemning his actions in Chechnya, Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas went them one better, calling for an end to
international aid to Moscow unless the Russian government stops
``killing women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot excuse Russian brutality,'' Bush said Friday morning
in the first major foreign policy speech of his campaign for the
Republican presidential nomination. ``When the Russian government
attacks civilians, it can no longer expect aid from international
lending institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the Ronald Reagan Library in the dry hills outside
Simi Valley, a suburb 40 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles,
Bush walked a fine line, balancing tough talk with more moderate
formulations. But he made it clear at the outset that he would hew
to the internationalist principles of his father and fight those in
his own party as well as those outside it who have sought ``to
build a proud tower of protectionism and isolationism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' he said, ``is the shortcut to chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   While the governor implicitly criticized those Republicans who
reject trade agreements with China and turn their backs on the
United Nations, he was more explicit in his criticism of Clinton,
accusing him without citing him by name of allowing the nation ``to
move from crisis to crisis like a cork in a current.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing Clinton's leadership unfavorably to his father, Bush
declared:
</P>
<P>
   ``Alliances are not just for crises, summoned into action when
the fire bell sounds. They are sustained by contact and trust. The
Gulf War coalition, for example, was raised on the foundation of a
president's vision and effort and integrity. Never again should an
American president spend nine days in China, and not even bother to
stop in Tokyo or Seoul or Manila. Never again should an American
president fall silent when China criticizes our security ties to
Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush delivered his 35-minute speech with considerable aplomb,
turning in a well-versed, well-drilled performance that on several
occasions rose to presidential level. He quoted Burke and Pericles
and Alexander Solzhenitzyn, and he even echoed a bit of
Churchillian rhetoric when he promised a foreign policy built upon
``idealism, without illusions; confidence, without conceit;
realism, in the service of American ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy seldom plays a central part in American
presidential campaigns. But it can prove decisive if a candidate
gives the impression that the management of the nation's affairs
overseas is beyond his reach.
</P>
<P>
   That happened to Gov. George Romney of Michigan in 1968, when he
said he had been ``brainwashed'' by American officials in Saigon,
and some Bush backers had feared that he faced similar risks. He
had called the Greeks ``Grecians'' and failed to identify important
foreign leaders when given an in-your-face pop quiz by a Boston
television reporter.
</P>
<P>
   His confident performance Friday put such fears to rest for the
moment. But Bush will face a much tougher challenge in a series of
three debates with his Republican rivals, starting in New Hampshire
on Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   They will press him, no doubt, to say more specifically than he
did Friday about what he meant when he asserted that ``American
internationalism should not mean action without vision, activity
without priority, and missions without end _ an approach that
squanders American will and drains American energy.'' Bush argued
that ``unless a president sets his own priorities, his priorities
will be set by others _ by adversaries, or the crisis of the
moment, live on CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   Few would disagree with that. The problem is defining priorities
and criteria for action, which Bush made no real attempt to do. A
president, he said simply, should extend the peace, build a united
Western Hemisphere linked by free trade, seek Middle East peace,
check the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and do it with
``patience, wisdom and strength.''

 SIMI VALLEY, Calif.: and strength.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Blackwill, a lecturer at the John F. Kennedy School of
government at Harvard University, who worked on the National
Security Council in the Bush administration, said that the governor
had concentrated heavily Friday on Russia and China because those
nations, ``not Haiti, not Somalia,'' impinged directly upon the
national interests of the United States. In fact, Bush made no
mention at all of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwill is a member of a small group counseling Bush on
foreign policy matters. It also includes Condoleezza Rice of
Stanford University, Paul Wolfowitz of Johns Hopkins University,
Robert Zoellick of Harvard, the German Marshall Fund of the United
States and Goldman, Sachs; and Richard Perle of the American
Enterprise Institute. All have served in past Republican
administrations, and several were with Bush Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two of Eurasia's greatest powers, China and Russia, are powers
in transition, and it is difficult to know their intentions when
they do not know their own futures,'' Bush told a largely invited
audience of about 400 people here. ``If they become America's
friends, that friendship will steady the world. But if not, the
peace we seek may not be found.''
</P>
<P>
   Consistency was one of Bush's main themes, especially on China.
Again without naming Clinton, he said the administration had called
the Chinese leadership ``the butchers of Beijing'' one year and
embraced the Chinese leadership as a ``strategic partner'' only a
few years later.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the governor said, he would stand up to China if
it threatened democratic nations in its region, such as Taiwan and
South Korea. He promised again to help Taiwan defend itself. And he
welcomed the idea of Chinese entry into the World Trade
Organization, while warning that ``it will take a strong
administration to hold them to their word,'' given what he termed
``China's poor record'' in honoring international agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must deal with China without ill-will, but without
illusions,'' Bush said in one of his many this-and-that statements.
China ``will be unthreatened, but not unchecked,'' he added a few
moments later.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced as ``a person who thinks for himself'' by former
Secretary of State George Shultz, who is an unofficial member of
the Bush brain trust, Bush spoke in a yearlong forum series
sponsored by the Reagan Library. Former first lady Nancy Reagan was
in the audience, as she was when Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
Bush's leading Republican rival, spoke here in September.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had many reasons to choose the Reagan Library as the venue
for his speech. California has more delegates to the Republican
convention than any other state, and Reagan went directly from two
terms as governor to the presidency without any previous Washington
experience, just as Bush is attempting to do.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Rice said, Bush wanted to contrast Reagan with
Clinton, especially with regard to the Californian's ``strength,
leadership and choosing a few goals, a few regions and
concentrating our national resources on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush won his loudest applause when he took a tough, Reaganesque
line in defense of what he called ``America's interests, America's
obligations and America's honor,'' and when he obliquely criticized
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to develop and deploy both theater and national
missile defense systems, and he ripped into the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty that the Senate recently rejected. The treaty, he said,
``does not stop proliferation, especially by renegade regimes by a
wide margin. It is not verifiable. It is not enforceable. And it
would stop us from ensuring the safety and reliability of our
nation's deterrent, should the need arise.''
</P>
<P>
   On the United Nations, he was again even-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never place U.S. troops under U.N. command, but the
U.N. can help in peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts,'' Bush
declared to warm applause at one point. ``If I am elected
president, America will pay its dues, but only if the U.N.'s
bureaucracy is reformed and our disproportionate share of its costs
is reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   There was even a slight bow to the French and their argument
that the American formula is not a one-size-fits-all model for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We value the elegant structures of our own democracy, ``the
governor said, ``but realize that, in other societies, the
architecture will vary. We propose our principles but we must not
impose our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush pre-sold his speech in telephone calls to columnists and
reporters in recent days, and his potential opponents, such as Vice
President Al Gore, had their aides calling to comment on it before
it had even been delivered. Clearly it was a big event in the
unfolding campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was put in a difficult position by Bush's call for an end
to international aid to Chechnya. Gore is closely associated with
the Russians, and he supported the administration when it held up
aid to Indonesia when its soldiers were killing people in East
Timor. It will be hard to argue that what the Russians are doing in
Chechnya is different.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing Republican criticism, the administration is reassessing
whether to announce a major resumption of American aid to Russia in
the next week or so, in the form of a half-billion dollars in loans
by the Export-Import Bank.

FOR NETS, WORSE HAS COME TO WORSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Nets knew Friday night's game against Boston would
be decided by execution and athleticism, but they were hoping that
history would play a part. Having won their last three games at the
Fleet Center, including a dramatic, final-second victory that ended
a seven-game losing streak last March, the Nets thought fate, luck
or some otherworldly force might lend them a hand.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the contest only added to the flurry of blows that the
woebegone Nets have already sustained over the first nine games of
this season. Looking superior in every way, the Celtics routed the
Nets, 109-96, before 15,201 fans, making history of New Jersey's
winning streak in Boston and putting this team into the franchise's
annals of futility.
</P>
<P>
   Now the owners of a 1-8 mark, the Nets have tied the club record
for the worst start in a season. Not since the 1977-78 season,
their second in the NBA, have the Nets started so horribly. That
squad finished 24-58 and will have its name removed from the record
books if the Nets lose Saturday night at home against the
Philadelphia 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury led the Nets with 26 points, and Keith Van Horn
added 18. Antoine Walker had 25 for the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Boston took command immediately, scoring nine of the game's
first 11 points to put the Nets in their customary first-quarter
hole. Adrian Griffin, Boston's 25-year-old rookie, who spent the
last three seasons in the Continental Basketball Association,
scored seven points in the first 2 minutes 37 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets gathered themselves and became competitive for a time,
slicing the lead to 26-25 with one minute left in the quarter. But
with an ease that suggested they had been toying with the Nets, the
Celtics pulled away to take a 51-40 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets had three problems. First, their offense went south.
After making 55 percent of their shots in the first quarter, the
Nets connected on just 6 of 26 attempts (23.1 percent) in the
second. Marbury laid low in the first period, shooting 1 for 2, but
in the second he fired seven shots, missing six. His basket was one
of only two that the Nets' starters managed in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Added to the inaccurate shooting was the fact that the Nets
could hardly secure a rebound. Dominating the backboards on both
ends of the floor, the Celtics outrebounded the Nets by 34-19 in
the first half. Griffin (eight), Vitaly Potapenko (seven) and Paul
Pierce (five) grabbed more rebounds combined than the entire Nets
team.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was the defense, which had more holes in it than
a fisherman's net. Without fear of being rejected or fouled, the
Celtics penetrated at will. There were crossover dribbles,
change-of-direction moves and spins. The way Boston's players
gracefully entered the lane, it looked choreographed. Walker dipped
and dodged for 12 points, while Griffin added 11 and Pierce seven.
</P>
<P>
   It looked to be more of the same in the third period as Boston
stretched the lead to 15 points over the first five minutes. But
Marbury almost single-handedly rallied the Nets. With his team
trailing by 14, he made a steal, then hit consecutive 3-pointers.
Van Horn followed with a dunk, and then Marbury made a dazzling
assist to Jamie Feick.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Nets were within six points and charging. Boston
held them off, but by the end of the period, the Nets had pulled to
within 81-76.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury had 14 points in the quarter, 12 from his four
3-pointers. But the joy was short-lived, as Boston surged in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' struggles have set the stage for an interesting scene
on Saturday in the Meadowlands. John Calipari, the coach dismissed
by the Nets after last season's 3-17 start, will return as an
assistant with the 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   Calipari's first appearance at Continental Arena since his
dismissal occurred during the preseason, but that was an exhibition
game when the Nets were cruising. Now, things are much different.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his dismissal in March, Calipari took most of the
blame for the club's underachievement. It is apparent now that he
was only part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the guys here in Philly are laughing about it, but I'm
trying to stay out of it,'' Calipari said Friday. ``I couldn't and
wouldn't do that. I won't undermine anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Calipari, however, did get a jolt out of the Nets' recent
decision to move Kendall Gill back to small forward. ``Oh, I
thought he had been playing out of position his whole life,'' said
Calipari, who initially moved Gill from shooting guard to small
forward in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While Calipari would not gloat, the 76ers' coach, Larry Brown,
may not be as kind. Brown stated before the season that Calipari
was done in by the Nets' president, Michael Rowe, the club's
general manager, John Nash, and Coach Don Casey, who he said
conspired to have Calipari dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' poor start has led to speculation that Casey and Nash
may be in danger of losing their jobs.

AUSSIE DOC SEEKS PILL FOR SUICIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most spies in the movies are supplied with a quick, painless
suicide pill for use in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Soon there may be such a pill in real life.
</P>
<P>
   If an Australian doctor has his way, people with terminal
illnesses will soon have access to, or be able to concoct
themselves, just such a swift, comfortable way out.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Philip Nitschke, called by some the ``Kevorkian Down
Under,'' is pursing development of a ``peaceful pill'' and has
opened death-counseling clinics in four Australian cities.
</P>
<P>
   Although vilified by Australia's medical and right-to-life
communities, Nitschke said he has counseled 44 terminally ill
people, in some cases providing do-it-yourself information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat of the death pill and the clinics are showing
opponents that this issue isn't going away,'' he said by telephone
Friday, Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suicide pill is also threatening to lawmakers, and for
good reason. If it can be formulated, it will be too late to
legislate this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nitschke will discuss his work at 1 p.m. today, Nov. 20, at the
annual meeting of Arizonans for Death with Dignity at Scottsdale's
Radisson Resort. The group is a chapter of the Hemlock Society, a
national right-to-die organization.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Wettstein of Tucson, the president of the state group,
wants to hear more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they (the clinics) are doable, I would like to see them in
Arizona,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about giving aid to the terminally ill, not to
those who are merely depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Such clinics would likely raise controversy here, as they did in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   How much?
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as the clinics were announced,'' Nitschke said,
``medical officials tried to have my medical license revoked.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the pill, he said he plans to look to the past. He is
studying sleeping-pill formulas developed by pharmaceutical
companies in the 1920s and 1930s that were rejected as too
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to soon find one that patients could make in their own
homes from easily available ingredients, thus avoiding the
involvement of the medical community and the government.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Clement of Sedona, a lawyer and author of the 1998 book
Freedom to Die, believes such backdoor approaches are becoming
necessary because Congress is moving against individual action at
the end of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal options for people who want to exercise their right
to die are looking grim,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, some religious leaders and the medical
establishment have mobilized against recent advances by the
right-to-die movement, such as successful voter initiatives in
Oregon, Clement said.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's law is the only one in the world that clearly allows
physician-assisted suicide. But Congress is likely to outlaw the
use of federally controlled drugs for that purpose. The measure
passed the U.S. House last month and is expected to clear the
Senate next year.
</P>
<P>
   This new restrictive attitude isn't limited to the United
States. Euthanasia has been common in the Netherlands, though not
specifically authorized by law. But many in that country anticipate
a law regulating euthanasia next year.
</P>
<P>
   Nitschke said that when a law allowing physician-assisted
suicide unexpectedly passed in Australia's Northern Territory in
1996, the Australian Medical Association stated that no doctor
would ever step forward to help people die.
</P>
<P>
   Then Nitschke did.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's federal government overturned the law nine months
later, despite polls showing support by 65 to 75 percent of the
public. Before the law was overturned, Nitschke helped four
terminally ill people end their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But people continued to ask him for help, he said, so he set up
clinics that dispense only advice.
</P>
<P>
   Nitschke was one of 25 right-to-die activists from around the
world in Seattle last weekend for a meeting of a new organization,
NuTech Group. The group plans to meet annually to discuss new ways
to help terminally ill people take their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   His proposed pill was the only pharmaceutical option discussed,
he said. Most of the new techniques involved masks or bags and the
breathing of gases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with recent laws limiting the rights of the terminally
ill, the issue is not dead,'' said Clement, of Sedona, who is also
a member of NuTech. ``There are people pressing on.'' &QL;

   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ The signs in this rural college town
read ``Aggieland,'' but for the faithful of Texas A&AMP;M University,
the expression is less a point on a map than a state of mind. Ask
someone to explain the fierce devotion of alumni, or the school's
arcane traditions, and the answer is often a smile or a shake of
the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the outside looking in, you can't understand it,'' said
Ian Hastings, 27, a 1995 graduate, repeating a familiar phrase.
``From the inside looking out, you can't explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase is particularly apt af- ter the collapse of a huge
structure students were building for the L Thanksgiving weekend
football bon-  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  fire. Eleven students died on
Thurs- day; another died Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   To outsiders looking in, the image of scores of students
clambering atop a 40-foot tower of logs in the early morning hours
with limited university oversight might seem unduly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   But to Aggies, as students and alumni are known, the bonfire is
a 90-year tradition that binds generations of students to one
another and to the university. Students aspire to become Red Pots
or Brown Pots, the upperclassmen who oversee the round-the-clock
construction effort. The state's lieutenant governor, Rick Perry,
and the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Henry
Cisneros, both hoisted logs in their undergraduate days. Recent
graduates often return to help out during the final week, known as
Push.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been said several times that once you're a part of A&AMP;M,
you have maroon blood,'' John Hoyle, a professor of educational
administration who has written about the university's lore, said of
the school's colors. ``You're a member of the long maroon line.''
</P>
<P>
   With the last body removed from the wreckage early Friday
morning, university officials pledged a full investigation into the
accident. A federal investigator with the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration arrived Friday. And even though the cause of
the accident had not yet been determined, the university police
announced that they would not conduct a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be an engineering determination,'' said Bob Wiatt,
public safety director for the university. ``There is no negligence
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood across campus Friday was somber as students wore white
and maroon ribbons or carried carnations and roses. Six of the 28
students injured in the accident remained hospitalized, including
one in critical condition. The hundreds of onlookers who stood
vigil for hours during the long rescue effort on Thursday had
mostly dispersed Friday, though some tearful students prayed or
simply stared at the cleared stacks of logs.
</P>
<P>
   University officials canceled this year's bonfire, which marks
the school's biggest football game against its rival, the
University of Texas. The football game is still scheduled for next
Friday at Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   The internal investigation is expected to examine the future of
the bonfire and whether changes are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the accident told rescuers they heard a loud pop or
crack just before the accident on Thursday, and officials are
expected to investigate whether the structure's 55-foot central
guide pole _ made of two huge pieces of wood joined by bolts and
heavy cable _ snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Lawson, a university spokeswoman, said officials would
first focus on consoling and healing the ``Aggie family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do is get to the bottom of what happened, and
make some decision based on that,'' Ms. Lawson said. ``To say if
we're going to change bonfire is probably premature at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Within Texas, where school rivalries are fierce, Texas A&AMP;M is
known for its almost religious adherence to traditions, some of
which are nearly a century old. For some, the gold class ring
awarded to seniors is worn for life, and Hoyle said the
indoctrination begins for with Fish Camp, where literally thousands
of incoming freshman attend a summer camp ``to learn the rituals,
the yells, to develop the friendships for life.''

   The most enthusiastic guardians of the rituals are the school's
2,000 member Corps of Cadets, a quasimilitary cadre who shave their
heads and wear uniforms to class. The most revered tradition is
Silver Taps, or Muster, the service held on the first Tuesday of
every month if a student has died during the month. Every year on
April 21, the anniversary of the battle of San Jacinto, the battle
in which Texas defeated Mexico to become a republic, alumni across
the world hold Muster to remember fallen Aggies. Last year,
officials said, alumni in 112 countries conducted the ritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent two years in Afghanistan running a medical school,''
recalled Dr. James H. ``Red'' Duke, a prominent alumnus who is
medical director of LifeFlight, the second oldest helicopter
medical program in the country. ``I had hepatitis in March of '71.
The first time I left the house I drove 90 miles to Aggie Muster in
Kabul on April 21st. There were nine Texas Aggies and nine Afghan
Aggies.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this same passion that permeates the tradition of Bonfire,
which first occurred in 1909 and until 1936 was fueled with stolen
desks, chairs and other items. Hastings, the 1995 graduate, said
his telephone rang in Dallas on Thursday morning within an hour of
the 2:28 a.m. accident and that he had arrived within five hours to
help with the rescue effort. ``My roommate said I had 47 messages
by nine in the morning,'' said Hastings, who served as a Brown Pot
while an undergraduate. ``My cell phone rang 100 times on the way
here. It's a big family.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Link, a fifth-year senior, said about 21 upperclassmen
serve as coordinators each year for harvesting trees and then
construction, 16 of whom are called Red Pots, the highest ranking,
and another five are Brown Pots. The nicknames are for the colors
of hats worn by coordinators during the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The colors are visual aids,'' said Link, a former Red Pot who
wore a T-shirt from the 1997 bonfire that read, ``Remember the
Tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got a lot of people working in a crowd, you need
to be able to stand out.''
</P>
<P>
   Link said that upperclassmen select new coordinators each year
and hand down instructions on how to build the 55-foot tiered
structure. There have been assorted minor injuries through the
years, and the structure collapsed in 1994 after heavy rains, but
no one was hurt. Link said the coordinators hold training courses
for the harvest and the construction process, and that different
work crews are scheduled 24 hours a day during Push week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a class that will teach them more than anything they
can learn on campus as far as people skills and work ethic,'' Link
said.
</P>

   But university officials, who sanction the event, say they have
exerted more oversight in recent years. A university liaison to the
project, Rusty Thompson, advises the students and officials said he
provides daily oversight. But though Thompson visited the tower
hours before the accident, detecting no problems, he was not
present when the accident occurred. Wiatt said a university police
officer was at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every student must go through a safety training program before
participating in bonfire,'' said Lane Stephenson, deputy director
of university relations. ``Safety has always been of paramount
importance, even though it is recognized that there are some
inherent risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, officials began a crackdown on alcohol use during
the project after occasional reports of drunkenness. Shannon Ensom,
21, a senior from Coppell, Tex., who served on an bonfire advisory
committee this year, said hundreds of students signed cards
pledging not to drink. The theme was, ``Don't Let Alcohol Shatter
the Tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to show everybody that that wasn't what bonfire is
about,'' she said. Stephenson said officials had heard no reports
of alcohol being involved in the accident.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether the university will exert even
greater control over the bonfire, or even cancel it, as the
University of Texas did years ago with a similar event. In a
response to a query delivered by e-mail, Cisneros spoke of the
``great esprit de corps'' and lessons of teamwork provided by the
bonfire. But the accident, he said, also made him realize the
inherent danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very graphic for me because I worked on that bonfire and
it's a huge project and just the weight of those logs and the scale
of it drives home how utterly dangerous it is when something goes
wrong,'' he said in a response left on an answering machine. ``I
guess it was always dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke, whose first bonfire came during his freshman year in 1946,
said the faithful of Aggieland ``can't redo this event but we can
learn from it. We always learn more when things are tough than when
they're going well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd give anything in the world for it not to have happened,''
he added. ``I think we have to go and figure out what's wrong,
correct it and proceed.''

ISTANBUL MEETING ENDS WITH NEW LIMITS ON ARMS, MILD STANCE ON
CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs 3rd graf to replace `province' with `republic')  
(See also EUROPE-SCENE)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ World leaders ended a 54-nation summit
meeting on European security Friday with the adoption of stiff new
limits on the size of conventional armaments in Europe, and a new
charter proclaiming that local conflicts were the legitimate
concern of all European states.
</P>
<P>
   But the main issue under discussion at the meeting of the
Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, Russia's war in
Chechnya, yielded only a call for a political settlement and
agreement on a future visit by an official of the organization
despite the criticism participants had heaped on Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   After a fiery defense of Russia's offensive against its maverick
republic by President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday, Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov said the timing of the visit by the organization's
envoy, Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek of Norway, was still to be
negotiated. Ivanov said he would be allowed to visit only areas
controlled by the Russian military, ``because we don't want him to
become a hostage.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, President Clinton declared himself encouraged by Russia's
acceptance of an organization visit and of the new charter: ``We've
got a lot of turns in the road in Chechnya before it's resolved,
but I would say that compared to how things were when we all got
here, those are the two things that I'm hopeful about.''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany called the outcome a
``respectable compromise,'' saying there had been moments when the
summit meeting seemed about to collapse. He also noted that hard
bargaining over the terms of the visit remained to be done with
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov also joined Clinton and the leaders of 28 other nations
in signing an updated agreement setting limits on conventional
weapons in Europe. But the Russian acknowledged that his country
would not meet the new limits until after its operations in the
Caucasus were concluded.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton said he would not present the accord to
the Senate until after the Russians came under the limits and the
fighting in Chechnya had ceased. Nonetheless, the new treaty was
seen as a significant adaptation to the new realities of
post-communist Europe. It cuts ceilings on tanks, combat vehicles,
artillery and combat aircraft by about half from those set in 1990,
when the goal was still to restrict the possibility of large-scale
war between NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adapted treaty will place legally binding limits on the
armed forces of every individual country that is party to it, from
the Atlantic to the Urals,'' Clinton said after the signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to expanding the original treaty from 20 nations to
30 and reducing the quantities of heavy armament, the new treaty
simplified procedures for inspection and verification. Officials
noted that the new ceilings would not have applied to the NATO
operation in Kosovo because it was mandated by the United Nations
and because Yugoslavia's membership in the Organization for
Security and Cooperation has been suspended since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia came under tough criticism throughout the meeting and
in the final declaration, which said, ``The leaders and people of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia must put the country on the path
toward democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms.'' The United States and leaders of the European Union
also held a demonstrative meeting with Serbian opposition leaders
to underscore the hope for the ouster of President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The new charter adopted by the meeting reflected the lessons of
Kosovo and other internal conflicts that have erupted since the
collapse of communism. It envisioned a new role for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in easing
tensions before they explode into war, including the possibility of
intervening not just in conflicts between states, but within
states.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have witnessed atrocities of a kind we had thought were
relegated to the past,'' the charter declared. ``In this decade, it
has become clear that all such conflicts can represent a threat to
the security of all OSCE participating states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Participating states are accountable to their citizens and
responsible to each other for their implementation of their OSCE
commitments,'' it said. ``We regard these commitments as our common
achievement and therefore consider them to be matters of immediate
and legitimate concern to all participating states.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The document envisioned rapid-response teams that could be
deployed quickly to manage crises.
</P>
<P>
   The final declaration of the meeting, however, was carefully
crafted to avoid directly challenging Yeltsin's impassioned
argument that Russia had every right to battle ``bandits and
murderers'' in its country.
</P>
<P>
   ``In connection with the recent chain of events in the North
Caucasus, we strongly reaffirm that we fully acknowledge the
territorial integrity of the Russian Federation and condemn
terrorism in all its forms,'' the document said. It also said that
``a political solution is essential, and that the assistance of the
OSCE would contribute to achieving that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the language was the
result of ``very long negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to oversell this,'' she said. ``I think that we
accomplished a lot. But this is a longer-term problem. I think that
we need to keep pushing it along. We have been given more tools to
deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   While she and European officials tried to portray Russia's
acceptance of an organization role as a step forward, the outcome
of the summit meeting was heralded in Moscow as a triumph for
Yeltsin. Clinton's remarks, expressing a measure of sympathy for
Russia's plight in Chechnya, were presented as an endorsement of
the Kremlin's policy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

</P>
<P>
   Ivanov, in an interview on Russian television, called Clinton's
remarks ``not so much a surprise as an important international
support of the resolute fight of the Russian leadership against
terrorism in the North Caucasus.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said the assault in Chechnya would continue
unchanged. Military officials said that Russian troops had
encircled about 80 percent of the capital, Grozny, and that
warplanes continued striking targets Friday, killing 150 rebels.
Those reports could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about the updated Treaty on Conventional Forces in
Europe, U.S. officials said the existing agreement had already
resulted in the destruction of more than 70,000 armaments by
participating countries. The new version was designed to reflect
the world's new political boundaries. Under the old treaty, members
of military alliances had to coordinate their military deployments
with their allies. But three members of the old Warsaw Pact _
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic _ are now members of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The new treaty also strengthens the requirement that host
countries must give consent for the deployment of foreign forces on
their territory. The language was designed to address security
concerns of several former members of the Soviet Union, including
Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   Russia agreed in the treaty to exercise restraint in its future
military deployments near the Baltic states. In signing the
agreement, Ivanov also reached agreements with Georgia and Moldova
to withdraw Russian forces from their territories in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   In refusing to submit the updated treaty for ratification until
Russia complies, Clinton sought to avoid another high-stakes
confrontation with the Senate, which last month rejected U.S.
participation in an international treaty banning nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton said it made sense to enter into the agreement now,
even with Russia in violation. Such clashes are not unprecedented.
Immediately after the treaty on conventional forces was signed in
1991, a dispute broke out over whether some forces in the Soviet
Union should be exempt. The matter was eventually settled between
Washington and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adapted treaty will enhance peace, security and stability
throughout Europe,'' the president said. ``Therefore, it is in
America's national interest to sign it now, and to lock in the
commitment of other nations to its terms. At the same time, in
order to reap the benefits, we must have confidence that there will
be real compliance.''

ST. JOHN'S UPSET BY SAMFORD, 68-60 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala.)  (mk) 
 By KEN GURNICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Playing against their former coach Fran
Fraschilla and his University of New Mexico Lobos didn't seem so
important after the St. John's men's basketball team was upset
Friday night by Samford University, 68-60, in the Cosida Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The official opener to the 1999-2000 season was a stunning
setback to the Red Storm. Perhaps looking ahead to a Saturday
matchup that might not even happen, St. John's was beaten by a team
it beat by 26 points in the opening round of last season's NCAA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Samford, last season's Trans America Athletic Conference
champion, won with better outside shooting and more aggressive
defense, exploiting St. John's lack of height inside.
</P>
<P>
   Now St. John's has a lot more to look forward to than playing
the coach the university fired after the 1997-98 season. The team
that reached the round of eight in the NCAA tournament last spring
will face the loser of the New Mexico-Dayton game here, with coach
Mike Jarvis looking to right the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Will Daniels' 17 points led a balanced Samford scoring
attack that included 16 points from forward Marc Salyers and 14
from Reed Rawlings, with 12 of those coming in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Bootsy Thornton led St. John's with 19 points, but he had
only four in the second half as Samford adjusted to shut him down.
St. John's forward Lavor Postell added 14 points and guard Reggie
Jessie had 10.
</P>
<P>
   Samford's height and aggressiveness translated into a 45-33
rebounding advantage, with Reed's 13 a game high. The Bulldogs
outshot St. John's, 44 percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's had to wait until the second game to learn whether it
would have a shot Saturday night at playing against Fraschilla.
Fraschilla departed after the 1997-98 season and was a scout for
the Knicks and a broadcast analyst last season.
</P>
<P>
   In its first season with Jarvis at the helm, St. John's easily
eliminated Samford from the first round of the NCAA tournament last
season, 69-43. But Samford, a small school from Birmingham, Ala.,
apparently erased any memory of that disaster. Playing with
confidence, Samford let St. John's know it was in for a battle
throughout a first half that saw seven lead changes.
</P>
<P>
   The game was played in the Pit, the University of New Mexico's
notorious house of horrors. But because the host Lobos were
scheduled to play in the nightcap, the arena was virtually empty
and eerily quiet when St. John's and Samford tipped off in the
first game.
</P>
<P>
   When they did, sophomore Anthony Glover was on the bench.
Glover, the 1997 New York state player of the year who sat out last
season because of academic problems, finally made his official
debut four minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
   In three minutes, Glover was tied up for one jump ball, dropped
a pass in the lane for a turnover and had the wind knocked out of
him when he took a charge by Samford's forward Rawlings, who led
his team with 12 first-half points. Glover picked up his third foul
just before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Postell scored the game's first five points, and that was the
biggest lead his team enjoyed in the first half. Samford also led
by as many as five points before taking a 31-29 advantage at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's seniors carried the offensive load. Thornton was too
quick for Samford defenders away from the ball and repeatedly found
open shots that he hit, scoring 15 points in the first half,
including two 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Storm had trouble with the outside shooting of
Samford, which hit its first three 3-point shots. Rawlings
displayed his soft outside shooting touch, but also exploited St.
John's lack of height when he wanted to work inside.
