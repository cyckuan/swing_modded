<HEADLINE> Clinton Opens Israeli-Palestinian Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
met Israeli and Palestinian leaders Thursday at the White House,
opening a summit between the two sides in a fresh round of efforts
to reach an agreement on Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
After the private meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Clinton is
scheduled to deliver a statement at the Rose Garden, setting goals
for the Israeli-Palestinian summit.
</P>
<P>
At center of the talks will be a U.S. proposal for a further
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank in exchange for
stricter Palestinian measures against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
With the approaching of a May 1999 deadline for completing a
full Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, U.S. officials told a
background briefing on Wednesday that they felt a sense of urgency
to end 19 months of stalemate over the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
After the White House opening session, Netanyahu and Arafat are
then flying to the Wye River Conference Center, a secluded resort
on Maryland's Eastern Shore about 70 miles (about 110 kilometers)
from Washington, to start formal negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The conference center, owned by the nonprofit Aspen Institute,
was chosen as the site because it is remote and comfortable and
can keep journalists away.
</P>
<P>
Washington believes sequestering Middle East leaders works in
achieving a breakthrough. In 1977, the Carter administration
brought together Israel and Egypt to the Camp David to negotiate
for about 18 days in seclusion and reached the historical Camp
David peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will go to the venue in mid-afternoon Thursday and have
dinner with Netanyahu and Arafat together at Wye, with only
Clinton returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
White House officials said Clinton was not scheduled to rejoin
the negotiators but would do so if it would help. Although there
was no timetable, the talks most likely would run through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We'd prefer not to speculate" what the U.S. hosts would do if
the goal of ending the stalemate by Sunday is not met, said State
Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
"We're prepared to be creative, to cajole," Rubin said.
"Secretary Albright is prepared to do all she can. But it will be
up to the leaders to make the hard choices necessary to put the
peace process back on track."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Arafat will discuss the proposal of Israeli
troops withdrawing from a further 13 percent of the West Bank.
Israel has controlled most of the West Bank since the 1967 war
with Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Israel wants firmer Palestinian assurances of security for
Jewish settlements in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Hunter: Union's Offer Being Positive Step </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The proposed tax on the
salaries of some free agents who sign under the "Larry Bird"
exception wasn't the deal-maker the players' union hoped it would
be.
</P>
<P>
But union executive director Billy Hunter said the owners can
no longer accuse players of not wanting to negotiate a collective
bargaining agreement that has led to them being locked out since
July 1 and resulted in the cancellation of the first two weeks of
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
"The message that we have is we are trying," said Hunter.
"We've honed something to try and salvage the season. We're
basically negotiating against ourselves, but not withstanding
that fact, we've seen fit to put forth what we consider a
positive proposal, one that addresses the concerns of the NBA
owners."
</P>
<P>
The union presented its proposal Tuesday during a session with
the league's Labor Relations Committee. It calls for the salaries
of players who sign under the Bird exception to be taxed at a 50%
rate if the average salary of their contract exceeds the average
of the league's top five salaries.
</P>
<P>
Last season, the top five average salary was 18 million U.S.
dollars a figure the union included in its proposal.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, if Michael Jordan signed another 33
million U.S. dollar contract, the tax on Chicago owner Jerry
Reinsdorf would be 7.5 million (50% of the 15 million U.S.
dollars in excess of 18 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Money collected from the luxury tax would be redistributed to
low-revenue teams, much like the system baseball adopted.
</P>
<P>
"The NBA has indicated time and again they are concerned about
the escalation and growth in Bird salaries," Hunter said. "What
we've done is specifically address that issue. We're not inclined
to see Bird go away, but we're prepared to address their
concerns, assuming it doesn't require the imposition of a hard
cap. "
</P>
<P>
The league has said it will analyze the union's proposal and
respond to it Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't expect to hear a proposal like that," NBA deputy
commissioner Russ Granik said.
</P>
<P>
NBA Commissioner David Stern said: "Under normal
circumstances, the tax system is not something we would embrace
at this late date. But I think we owe it to the fans to look at
this."

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stresses Cooperation With Israel and Arabs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot minister of commerce,
industry and tourism said Thursday that Cyprus has much to benefit
from its cooperation with Israel while stressing close ties with
Arab countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Nicos Rolandis said this at Larnaca Airport upon his return
from Israel, where he and a delegation of businessmen in tow
attended a three-day Prime Minister's Business Jubilee Summit.
</P>
<P>
The business summit, which started Tuesday, was organized by
Israeli government to boost its foreign trade and attract more
investments.
</P>
<P>
Rolandis said a trade agreement has been signed and an
agreement on avoiding double taxation is under discussion.
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot to benefit from our cooperation with Israel, but
I must say that we also cooperate with Arab countries in the
region," Rolandis said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Cypriot government, in its drive to diversify
economy, wants the island "to become a regional center, a country
accepted by all in this region."
</P>
<P>
The minister said he had a brief meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who spoke highly of achievements
Cyprus has made in all fields and its future role in the economic,
trade, tourism and high technology fields.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' relations with Israel have been enhanced since Cyprus
opens its embassy in Tel Aviv five years ago and through the
exchange of visits by high-ranking officials.

<HEADLINE> Turkey-Syria Crisis Does Not Serve People's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A world-wide Islamic
organization stressed Thursday that the current dispute between
Syria and Turkey would not serve the interest of their peoples.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the Jeddah-based Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC) said that OIC Secretary General Ezzidine Laraki
met separately on Wednesday with the Turkish and Syrian consuls in
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish consul Ugur Dogan conveyed a letter from Turkish
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem on his country's view regarding the
dispute with Syria, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The letter urged Laraki to mediate between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Dogan, Laraki underlined the need to
avoid threats between the two Muslim neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Tensions mounted recently between Syria and Turkey after they
traded accusations against each other, and Turkey reportedly
massed troops along its border with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors have long been at odds over issues including
Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), water sharing and
the Turkish-Israeli military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Syria of harboring the PKK rebels, who
have been fighting against the Turkish government since 1984 for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Syria has lashed out at Turkey, a predominantly Muslim
country, for forming a military alliance with Israel, which it
says is targeted against the Arab world, especially itself, and
undermines its bargaining position in negotiations with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Israel is still occupying Syria's Golan Heights, captured in
the 1967 Middle East war. Damascus insisted on its return as a
condition for peace with the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> FAA Urges Airlines to Replace Insulation on Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) has recommended airlines to replace the
insulation on almost all of the world's 12,000 passenger jets to
avoid fire when exposed to light heat.
</P>
<P>
As the Washington Post reported Thursday, the FAA
recommendation was made on Wednesday following the investigation
of Swissair Flight 111, which crashed off the coast of Nova
Scotia, Canada, last month.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the crash was not known, but there are indications
that some of the wreckage had been subjected to heat and possibly
a fire.
</P>
<P>
The retrofit affects almost all airliners manufactured by
Boeing, Airbus Industries, McDonnell Douglas and Fokker, the FAA
said. And the cost for the switch could total billions of U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The replacement of insulations will not disrupt flight
schedules because it would be performed during regular major
maintenance periods.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the FAA has known about the potential
flamability of jet insulation for at least two years, but it did
not consider the matter urgent until after the crash of Swissair
Flight 111.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, The Civil Aviation Administration of China strongly
recommended new tests after a Chinese Eastern MD-11 fire in
Beijing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese agency told the FAA its own tests found that the
insulation burst into flames, but the FAA brushed this off on
grounds that the tests conducted by the Chinese side were not
required by the FAA, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
After its own tests, Boeing Co. recommended last year that the
metalized Mylar insulation -- still in use on the Swissair MD-11
-- be removed from planes manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, which
Boeing acquired in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the Flight 111 crash, investigators found pieces of
metalized Mylar in the wreckage, although no burned pieces have
been found yet. But investigators are examining whether these
insulation caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
Investigators found metalized Mylar had been implicated in at
least three major aircraft fires in China, Italy and Denmark,
although no one was killed in those fires as they took place on
the ground. The insulation blankets were not a source of ignition,
but they erupted to electrical short circuits.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Kicks Off Mideast Peace Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday kicked off a new-round Middle East peace summit, calling
on Israeli and Palestinian leaders to work together for peace in
the region.
</P>
<P>
"These two people have the power to lead their nations to
peace," Clinton told reporters at the Rose Garden after meeting
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat in the Oval Office at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged the two Mideast leaders to "break the logjam"
over a U.S. proposal for a West Bank settlement.
</P>
<P>
"We must remember as we come together again that, in the end,
peace is more than a process; it is, in the end, a destination,"
Clinton said in a brief statement.
</P>
<P>
Flanked by the two leaders, Clinton said this week's
negotiations at a retreat on Maryland's Eastern Shore are being
undertaken with a sense of urgency after a year and a half of
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
"This week's talks at Wye River offer the chance for the
parties to break the logjam and finally take the next essential
steps for peace," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
With the approach of a May deadline for completing a full
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, U.S. officials said they hoped
the talks at Wye River would resolve key issues.
</P>
<P>
In his Rose Garden remarks, Clinton cautioned that both sides
must be ready to make compromises.
</P>
<P>
"As in any difficult problem, neither side can expect to win
100 percent of every point," Clinton said. "But concessions that
seem hard now will seem far less important in the light of an
accord that moves Israelis and Palestinians closer to lasting
peace."
</P>
<P>
In their Rose Garden appearance, neither Netanyahu nor Arafat
spoke. Clinton told reporters they had agreed not to take
questions yet. "For right now we think it's time to go to work,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
At the center of the talks will be a U.S. proposal for a
further withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank in
exchange for stricter Palestinian measures against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But the two parties also were to discuss releases of
Palestinian prisoners, opening an industrial park and airport in
the Gaza Strip and free-passage corridors between Gaza and the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Washington believes sequestering Mideast leaders works in
achieving a breakthrough. In 1977, the Carter administration
brought together Israel and Egypt to the Camp David to negotiate
for about 18 days in seclusion and reached the historical Camp

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Is a Good Place for Business, Says Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria is a good place to do
business, Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov said Wednesday at
the closing of the Bulgaria Investment Forum.
</P>
<P>
Increased consumption resulting from the 13-14 percent growth
in the population's income since the beginning of this year will
bring Bulgaria a lasting economic growth, Kostov said.
</P>
<P>
As 86 percent of Bulgaria's gross domestic product (GDP)
depends on consumption, he said, the increase is a guarantee for a
4.5-to-5.5-percent economic growth by the end of the year and in
coming two years.
</P>
<P>
The share of private business in the Bulgarian economy will
also increase, he said.
</P>
<P>
Data from the National Statistical Institute suggest that the
private sector accounted for 62 percent of the GDP in the second
quarter of this year, and it is expected to go up to 65 percent by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's membership of the Central European Free Trade
Agreement (CEFTA) and its agreement with Turkey on the
liberalization of trade will have a positive effect on Bulgaria's
economic development as of the beginning of next year, Kostov said.
</P>
<P>
"The liberalization of the country's customs regulations,
prompted by its CEFTA membership, will secure its entry into such
strategic markets as the Central European countries," Kostov
said.

<HEADLINE> Only One Fifths of Zambian New Voters Register </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Less than one fifths of Zambian
eligible new voters have registered to vote in the country's
forthcoming local government elections, the date for which has
not been announced.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures released by the Electoral Commision
Thursday in Lusaka, only 291,672 people registered throughout the
country during the just-ended five-week long voter registration
exercise, showing a serious shortfall to the targeted 1.5 million
new voters.
</P>
<P>
Zambia with a population of 9.6 million had 2.2 million
registered voters in 1996 before the country's general elections
in that year. And this year, the Electoral Commission expected to
register 1.5 million new voters to bring the total to 3.7 million
out of the country's 4.3 million eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, which started on August 24 and was scheduled to
end on September 13, had to be extended twice due to voter
apathy.
</P>
<P>
The Electoral Commission extended the exercise for another two
weeks to end it on September 27 in a bid to register more voters.
</P>
<P>
Bobby Bwalya, Chairman of the Electoral Commission, last month
attributed the prevailing voter apathy to the people's loss of
confidence in their elected representatives.
</P>
<P>
The local government elections which should have taken place
in 1995, have been delayed for a period of three years.
</P>
<P>
The date for the polls will be designated by the head of
state, President Frederick Chiluba. People believe it should be
some day before the rainy season comes next month.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Crisis in Nigeria to Persist Till 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria may not see an end to
the perennial scarcity of petroleum products until January next
year when the country's four refineries are expected to be put
back in shape.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Akilaja, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union
of Petroleum and Gas Workers (NUPEGW), said in Nigerian capital
Abuja Wednesday that the government had assured in a recent
meeting with NUPEGW officials that all the broken refineries
would be revitalized in the next three months, The Post Express
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The West African country has been hit by fuel crisis since
early 1997, and former Petroleum Minister Dan Etete promised
early this year that the crisis would be solved by last
September.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the Warri Refinery last week, which was the only
one functioning of four refineries in the country, has heightened
fears of a worsening of the lingering nationwide fuel scarcity.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
launched the Vitamin A food fortification logo in a bid to
enhance the people's health status in the country.
</P>
<P>
National Planning Minister Chief Rasheed Gbadamosi said in
the capital Abuja Wednesday that about 16 million Nigerians
currently suffer from Vitamin A deficiency in the country, the
Daily Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that women and children formed the most vulnerable
groups affected by vitamin deficiencies and the government had
implemented a national program to curb the trend.
</P>
<P>
To this end, he said, the Nigerian government has concluded
arrangements to fortify selected food items, namely wheat, maize,
vegetable oil and sugar with vitamin A.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Nigeria will soon adopt a national food and
nutrition policy as part of measures to improve the welfare of
Nigerians, he stated.
</P>
<P>
On the same logo launching occasion, Patrick Adebayo, Chairman
of the National Committee on Food and Nutrition, said that the
Vitamin A food fortification logo was aimed at improving the
welfare and health of Nigerians through the consumption of food
with sufficient Vitamin A content.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Mission Sent to Yugoslavia to Monitor Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has decided to send a mission to the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia to explore the Secretariat's first-hand capability
to assess what is going on in Kosovo, a U.N. spokesman said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference here
that the U.N. mission would continue to report to the 15-member
Security Council on Belgrade's compliance with its resolutions,
which demanded an arms embargo against Yugoslavia, an immediate
cease-fire and the opening of a political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The mission, headed by Staffan de Mistura who is director of
the United Nations Information Center in Rome, groups
representatives from various U.n. departments and agencies. The
mission will arrive in the region over the weekend, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
De Mistura has extensive United Nations inter-agency experience
in the field of emergency areas, the spokesman said, adding that
he has been entrusted with special tasks by successive
secretaries-general, more recently in connection with the
humanitarian assistance to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the decision at the request of a Security
Council statement last week, which came in response to what Annan
has said in his report on Kosovo -- he lacks "necessary means" to
verify Belgrade's compliance with U.N. resolutions because of no
U.N. presence on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
and U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke, at the end of marathon
talks, reached an agreement, including the president's acceptance
of 2,000 international observers and NATO reconnaissance flights
to monitor promised withdrawal of troops and the police from
Kosovo, Serbia's province of mainly ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts broke out in February in Kosovo after ethnic
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the province's population of
2 million, have been battling with Serbs for independence.

LAGOS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria may not see an end to

JOHANNESBURG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A tug-of-war has been
intensifying between the Swazi government and forces calling for a
boycott of Friday's non-party general elections, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Swazi government is urging people in the kingdom to vote,
declaring Friday a paid public holiday to enable workers to vote in
their home constituencies if they wish, SAPA quoted
unidentified Swazi sources as saying.
</P>

More than 300 canidates are preparing to contest 55 parliament seats.
</P>
<P>
However, the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions, which supports
the election boycott until political parties are unbanned, has told
its members to go to work.
</P>
<P>
Under the current Swazil constitution approved in October 1978,
the king is the top leader of Swaziland, and no party is allowed to be
established in the country, which is bordering with South Africa and
Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> HK Finance Secretary: West Supports HK's Moves in Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Western financial leaders have
expressed "outpouring understanding and support" for the Hong Kong
government's moves taken to stabilize the securities markets, said
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of China Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After what has happened in the international financial markets
lately, especially the shocking news of the Long-Term Capital
Management, financial leaders in Western countries have come up
with some new understanding on the potential harmful movements of
hedge funds, the free market economy, and the Hong Kong
government's incursion into the stock market in August, he said at
a press conference.
</P>
<P>
In the past 18 days, Tsang has visited Germany, the
Netherlands and the United States, and attended annual sessions of
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"No central bank governor or financial minister has made any
negative comment on what we've have done," he said in response to
a question.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Hong Kong Association luncheon after that, Tsang
said that British Chancellor of Exchequer Gordon Brown supported
the actions of the Hong Kong government, calling it "the right
thing and a bold decision."
</P>
<P>
"Elsewhere I have encountered similar endorsements from
bankers, business and finance ministers. I think they have taken
the pragmatic view, like we did, that it is far better to have a
market in which to invest, than to have no market at all," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Everything we have done, all the pain we have endured, has
been to protect our linked exchange rate which has served us so
well since it was introduced in 1983," he said. "I am confident
that with Hong Kong's high savings rate, tremendous
entrepreneurial spirit and deep reserves, we will be able to
adjust and restructure our economy. Indeed, we have already."
</P>
<P>
On the global front, he stressed "the pressing need to help
Brazil," which accounts for 40 percent of the total trade in Latin
America. Also, he pointed to the need for greater transparency in
international capital flows, with regard primarily to the
financial position of investment funds, especially their exposures
in different markets and the degree of their leverage, so as to
curb potential manipulative and predatory behavior.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it's important to look at what he called "the
Bretton Woods legacy in light of globalization," in terms of
building a global framework of transparency, strong financial
systems and a uniform set of rules for competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The market works, but the government has a role in maintaining
the stability and integrity in markets," he said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for U.N. Access to UNITA Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday unanimously adopted a resolution, renewing the
mandate of the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) for another
six weeks.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also demanded that the Angolan government give
the U.N. special envoy free and safe access to the rebel UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called on UNITA to "comply immediately and
without conditions" with relevant U.N. resolutions and the 1994
peace accord, known as the Lusaka Protocol, which ended two
decades of civil war in the southern African nation.
</P>
<P>
The accord has been crumbling recently with renewed fighting
between the two sides and the government's decision to negotiate
only with a group of UNITA dissidents who split with UNITA leader
Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan leadership last month prevented the U.N. special
envoy, Issa Diallo, from meeting with Savimbi, saying it couldn't
assure Diallo's safety and threatening to stop all contact with
Diallo if the meeting occurred.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution, the 15-member Security Council demanded the
government and UNITA "guarantee unconditionally the safety and
freedom of movement of the special representative of the
secretary-general and all United Nations and international
personnel."
</P>
<P>
Council members agreed to extend the mandate of the U.N.
Observer Mission until Dec. 3, and asked the U.N. chief to submit
a "comprehensive report" by Nov. 23 on the future U.N. role in
Angola. Over the past four years, the United Nations has scaled
down its peace monitoring force in Angola from 7,000 to just 800.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said that the extension of the MONUA's mandate
"provides the special representative of the secretary-general with
an additional opportunity to revive the stalled peace process."
</P>
<P>
The resolution also asked UNITA to use this time "to transform
itself into a genuine political party and to secure a legitimate
and constructive role in the Angolan political process."
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General Kofi Annan has warned that the precarious
security situation in Angola, and the crumbling of the
U.N.-mediated accord, threatened the U.N. presence there. He has
warned that the United Nations may have to withdraw entirely from
Angola by February.
</P>
<P>
The resolution asked Annan to continue to adjust the U.N.
presence as required.
</P>
<P>
UNITA fought a civil war against the government for nearly two
decades after Angola won independence from Portugal in 1975. The
1994 accord ended the fighting, but the United Nations says UNITA
has resisted implementing it, particularly by refusing to hand
over four key territories and demobilize its troops.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution, council members demanded that UNITA turn
over the territories and withdraw immediately from land it has
reoccupied through military offensives.
</P>
<P>
The council called for an investigation into reports that
Savimbi traveled outside of Angola and that UNITA forces received
military training, assistance and arms from outside Angola -- both
violations of U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The council expressed its deep concern at the continued
deterioration of the humanitarian situation and "the lack of
access by humanitarian organizations to vulnerable groups."

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder's Social Democratic Party (SPD) has rejected a call from
the ecologist Greens party for a quick shutdown of Germany's
nuclear power plants, but has agreed to accept negotiated closures
with no time limit, a German press report said.
</P>
<P>
The new government to be formed by the SPD and its most likely
coalition partner, the Greens, would try to negotiate an accord
with energy companies to phase out the country's nuclear power
plants, German press reports quoted sources at the coalition talks
between the two parties as saying.
</P>
<P>
If no accord could be reached within one year, the new
government would seek a law to force an eventual quit from nuclear
energy production.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown of nuclear power plants has been viewed as a main
sticky point at the coalition talks between the SPD and Greens.
</P>
<P>
Citing environmental harms, the Greens has been asking for a
shutdown of all 19 nuclear power plants within five years. About
one third of Germany's energy supply are now covered by nuclear
energy.
</P>
<P>
The SPD and Greens hope to wind up their coalition negotiations
within this week. If a deal could be reached, Schroeder would be
formally elected chancellor by the new parliament on October 27.

MOSCOW, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister
Zoran Lilic Thursday accused NATO of "arming the Albanian
separatists in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"NATO itself provoked tensions over Kosovo," said Lilic, who

Alexander Lukashenko and the two discussed joint measures to

"We discussed what we can do to protect our countries and
people," Lilic said.

Belgrade is ready to "defend itself with all means available
against NATO bomb and missile strikes," Lilic said.

"We know how strong NATO is, but we also know that everything
possible must be done to defend the motherland," he added.

He expressed "profound gratitude to the Belarussian president

<HEADLINE> More Power Should Be Shifted to ECB, Says CEPR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The remarkable stability of the
exchange rates of the EMU countries in a sea of financial turmoil
has led to complacency among European policymakers.
</P>
<P>
This view was expressed in a new report, entitled "Monitoring
the European Central Bank: Safe At Any Speed?", published by the
Center for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the report argued that this complacency presents
serious risks for the European Central Bank (ECB), saying these
risks result from three factors:
</P>
<P>
First, the ECB suffers from a series of faults in its design.
The consequences of these design problems are likely to surface if
the world financial crisis hits euroland;
</P>
<P>
Second, just a few weeks before the start of EMU, important
decisions about the operational procedure of the ECB have still to
be made;
</P>
<P>
Third, even under normal economic conditions, the ECB will face
problems that originate from Europe's rigid labor markets and from
the existence of 11 independent fiscal authorities.
</P>
<P>
The report believed that the ECB suffers serious faults in its
design that sooner or later will surface. This is likely to happen
when large shocks, such as the world financial crisis, hit
Euroland.
</P>
<P>
These design faults are due to a failure to put sufficient
decision making power at the center of the system, it added.
</P>
<P>
The report also argued that national central banks maintain too
much power, which weakens the ECB. This will be particularly
troublesome when quick decisions have to be made.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the problem, it said more power and
responsibilities should be shifted to the ECB at the expense of
national central banks.
</P>
<P>
Supervision should also be centralized and the responsibilities
to manage the system in crisis situations should be clearly
spelled out, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The CEPR is a network of over 400 Research Fellows based
throughout Europe, who collaborate through the center in research
and its dissemination.

JERUSALEM, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Finance Minister
Yaacov Neeman stressed on Thursday that the Jewish country's
economy is stable despite of the widespread financial crisis
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Israeli Jubilee Business Summit in Jerusalem,
Neeman said that Israel had not been affected much by the crisis
though its economy was open to the world.
</P>
<P>
Neeman said that this was attributed to the right direction of
the government's economic policy.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was organized by the government as part of
celebration activities marking the 50th anniversary of the
establishment of the Jewish state with the aim to attract
investment.
</P>
<P>
Neeman encouraged foreign companies to invest in Israel,
citing that the economic environment in Israel is good for
investment.
</P>
<P>
He also said Israel would continue its economic reform, noting
that the government would privatize more state-owned companies and
encourage the competence in the market.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 150 foreign companies from 28 counties took
part in the Jubilee Business Summit, which ended its three-day
session on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Neeman said the fact that so many important foreign
businessmen joined the meeting approved the confidence of foreign
investors in the Israeli economy.

ANKARA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said here Thursday that Turkey supports Estonia in its
effort to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference following his talks with
visiting Estonian President Lennart Meri, Demirel said that
"Turkey supports the wishes of Estonia and other Baltic countries
for becoming members of the NATO."
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a NATO member, was one of the first countries
which recognized Estonia when it gained independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Demirel pointed out that trade ties between Turkey and Estonia
have not developed as fast as their political ties, and Turkey is
ready to provide aid to Estonia in every field.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Meri expressed gratitude for Turkey's support for
Estonia's request to join the NATO, adding that despite the
geographical distance, the two countries have close relations.
</P>
<P>
He added that he and Demirel also discussed the economic
crisis in Russia.
</P>
<P>
During the welcoming ceremony for Meri who arrived here
Thursday on a three-day visit, Demirel said that Turkey
appreciated the reforms in Estonia, adding that "Turkey is one of
the leading countries who support the readiness of Estonia to

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's President-Elect Pledges Comprehensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's president-elect Emile
Lahoud Thursday pledged that he would carry out a comprehensive
reform concerning politics, administration, economic and social
affairs, in his six-year term of office.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in his public speech hours after he was
elected as president by the parliament on Thursday morning, the
official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"I know there are a lot of hopes kept in the hearts of
Lebanese people who have been longing for some changes into
administration, politics, economic and social affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I will invite all government officials to be involved in this
reform campaign which will start from the top," Lahoud added.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old general received votes from all 118 deputies
attending the session, a victory which had been expected earlier
this month when Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and his Lebanese
outgoing counterpart Elias Hrawi reached a consensus on his
selection.
</P>
<P>
With 35,000 troops deployed in Lebanon as peacekeepers, Syria
has been closely coordinating stance with its tiny neighbor on
key issues.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Syrian backing, Lahoud, himself, has gained
wide popular support due to his outstanding accomplishment in
rebuilding the dispirited army left from the 1975-90 civil war
into a non-sectarian force of some 65,000.
</P>
<P>
People have expressed the hope that the reform-minded general
will introduce drastic changes into political life which is
described by opposition parties as full of corruption,
bureaucratism and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud also stressed the necessity of an alliance with Syria in
seeking a full Israeli withdrawal from both countries, not a part
pullout or a settlement which is aimed at separating the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured Syria's Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle East
war and set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 to allegedly protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between Israel and Syria, Lebanon have been
broken off since the hardline Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu came to power in 1996.

Tourism is a multi-faceted service, he said, which brings
considerable profits, increases communications between
different nations, and offers entertainment after improving
people's standard of living.
</P>
<P>
China's tourism industry has developed a great deal in recent
years with its abundant resources and little-seen scenery. And
thanks to better living standards, people now all want to spend
holidays sightseeing, learning more about our motherland.
</P>
<P>
We should cherish this good fortune and let it play its full
role. Tourism and environmental protection are closely related,
and may be at odds, so we need to integrate them and let them
supplement each other, Li pointed out. Tourist organizers and
tourists have an obligation to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that parliamentary-level exchanges are a very
important part of national diplomacy and have broad prospects in
China which is raising its international status and improving its
economy.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the sole purpose of these exchanges is to
pursue peace and development in the world, promote
multi-polarization, and create a healthy international environment
for Chinese modernization. These exchanges are also the people's
communication, which needs the involvement of the National
People's Congress, the government, and other non-government
organizations with the NPC playing the key role.

<HEADLINE> Tax Row Settled in Somali Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 16 (Xinhua) --A settlement has been reached
over a serious row in the southern Somali port town of Kismayu
</P>
<P>
The settlement was made after General Mohamed Saeed Hirsi
Morgan of Kismayu ordered the increase of the tax by 20 percent
on all imported commodities, said reports from Kismayu Friday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the given reasons that the revenue would be used for
the improvement of the fragile security situation in Kismayu, the
businessmen had fully rejected the decree early in the week which
had brought about the closure of the port for few days.
</P>
<P>
The taxes will also affect the airport of the town where
planes carrying consignments of the narcotic green leaves known
as khat from Kenya arrive everyday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting at the seaport of Kismayu Thursday, 500 km South
of the capital, the local authorities led by General Mohamed
Saeed Hirsi Morgan, the port authority and a delegation
representing the business community have resolved that the
current rate of tax should increased by 20 percent effective from
Friday in accordance to the earlier rejected decree of General
Morgan.
</P>
<P>
According to businessmen who contacted the journalists on the
VHF radio here in Mogadishu, a compromise had been reached that
tax exemption will be made for 10 percent of the goods being
imported by the businessmen from abroad the country including the
cosmetics and building materials.
</P>
<P>
In their turn, the local authority led by General Morgan have
pledged that they will guarantee the security of the imported
goods at and inside the sea and airports premises till the road
leading to the city stores.
</P>
<P>
The authority has also pledged that they will demolish all
illegal roadblocks within and outside the town so as ensure the
smooth flow of the business in and around Kismayu.
</P>
<P>
Following the agreement, a large tax collection campaign
attended by more than 200 armed militiamen has began in the
markets, business centers and shops of the town.
</P>
<P>
The people were told that the new campaign will create them
safe environment for their business, education for their children
and the sanitation of the town.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- United Sports Fans of
America (USFANS) offered to act as something of mediator in the
NBA's labor dispute Thursday.
</P>
<P>
USFANS President Frank Stadulis, during separate meetings with
league and union officials, proposed that his group look at the
league's books and determine which teams are losing money in
hopes of ending the lockout that has led to the cancellation of
the first two weeks of the NBA season.
</P>
<P>
"At the heart of the debate is how many teams are losing mone
y, and if they are losing money, how much," he said.
</P>
<P>
NBA Commissioner David Stern has said half of the league's 29
teams are losing money, but the union says only four are in the
red.
</P>
<P>
"We will give an honest assessment of what we find," Stadulis
said. "I'm not trying to pass us off as a salary negotiator. We
just want to get the games back on."
</P>
<P>
Brian McIntyre, NBA vice president for public relations, said,
"We met with Frank and gave him an update on the status of the
lockout."

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Over 45,000 people in Andhra
Pradesh, south India, have been evacuated following heavy rains
since Thursday night and the army in the area has been ordered to
stand by to meet any emergency.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Friday that 72 people
have been killed so far in the floods spawned by the rains.
</P>
<P>
Andhra Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu reviewed the flood
situation Friday at a high-level meeting and the state government
decided to carry out the evacuation in view of the unprecedented
discharge of around 841,000 cusecs of water from Nagarjunasagar
dam into river Krishna.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PTI said, the government has sought the advice
of experts to restore generation in a local hydro power plant
which was shut down due to flooding of seven of its units Thursday
night.

<HEADLINE> Money, Leverage ride on Arbitratior's Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Two members of the
Washington Wizards, Juwan Howard and Lorenzo Williams, have more
than a biweekly paycheck hanging on a pivotal ruling Monday.
</P>
<P>
That's when arbitrator John Feerick will decide whether NBA
teams have to pay approximately 800 million U.S. dollars in
guaranteed contracts despite the current league-imposed lockout.
</P>
<P>
The union filed a grievance with Feerick on behalf of about
200 players with guaranteed contracts. Howard was due 6.5 million
U.S. dollars on July 1, a sum that represented half his salary
for the upcoming season, and Williams was owed his entire 1998-99
pay of 1.316 million U.S. dollars on the same date, according to
Williams' agent and a source with access to Howard's contract.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the league canceled the first two weeks of the
regular season and, privately, union leadership has been hopeful
a favorable ruling by Feerick will give players leverage in
bargaining.
</P>
<P>
"If he rules in favor of the owners, it's going to kill the
players," Wizards forward Tracy Murray said.
</P>
<P>
"If he rules in our favor, players will stay home for three
years from now if they know eventually they will get their
money," said Wizards guard Tim Legler.
</P>
<P>
The league was completing work yesterday on a counteroffer it
expects to deliver today to the union. The essence of the labor
dispute is player salaries, with the owners wanting to control
the growth of salaries by installing an inflexible ceiling on
team payrolls.
</P>
<P>
The union has proposed imposing a luxury tax on teams who pay
players more than $18 million a year. Its proposal would retain
the current flexible salary cap and the Larry Bird Exception, a
provision that allows teams to exceed the salary cap to re-sign
their own free agents.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, several players' agents who are
members of a union advisory council that represents 75 percent of
the players disputed an unfair labor charge that Atlanta agent
Stephen Woods made to the National Labor Relations Board on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He alleged that Hunter was giving the players false
expectations to promote union unity.
</P>
<P>
Agent Steve Kauffman, who represents three Wizards and 16
other players, said yesterday that Woods, who represents two
players, was" on an island by himself." He also said Woods's
action may have been motivated by the union's turning away his
efforts to join the 23-member Agents Advisory Council.
</P>
<P>
"That is not true at all," Woods said, "I told them I was
interested and available to join the process."

<P>
But, Li said, relying on legislation for environmental
protection is not enough, and better supervision of
law-enforcement by people's congresses, the public, and the media
is needed. Media organizations have done good work in recent years
and their success should be recognized, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has relatively limited natural resources, he said, and
government departments need to pay more attention to resource
development and to place more importance on saving resources.
</P>
<P>
China has had a campaign to deal with seriously polluted areas,
he said. For example, small paper mills and other polluters have
been shut down in the Huai River valley, where water quality has
improved as a result.
</P>
<P>
He also reminded people of the difficulties in environmental
protection. He said people's lives and economic growth all
depend on resources and how to protect the environment during
economic development and how to use resources rationally will be
another test for people, and these contradictions need to
be dealt with properly.
</P>
<P>
It also needs more investment and technical applications, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Foreign delegates to the APPCED showed great interest in the
environmental development in Guilin, he said, pointing out that
these achievements in environmental protection could not have
been made without the efforts of the people and the support of the
government, and could not be separated from increasing amounts of
input.

Li said this conference is focusing on protecting the
environment and resources and the sustainable development of
tourism, and that this is significant to China and other countries
in the Asia-Pacific region.

LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern said Friday he hoped the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to
the leaders of Northern Ireland's two main political parties would
renew the courage of all involved in achieving peace.
</P>
<P>
"I warmly congratulate John Hume and David Trimble on winning
the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize," Ahern was quoted by Reuters as saying
in a statement. "It is a deserved tribute to two of the principal
architects of the Good Friday Agreement... and I hope (the prize)
will give everyone renewed courage to go forward."
</P>
<P>
He said the prize would be a strong encouragement to the two
men's political parties and to both of Northern Ireland's
communities to "justify the faith of the international community
and ensure that the Good Friday Agreement is consolidated."
</P>
<P>
Moderate Catholic John Hume had given all his political life to
the pursuit of peace and to the building of a new society in
Northern Ireland, while Northern Ireland First Minister-designate
David Trimble deserved great credit for his leadership of the
Unionist community, he said in the statement released in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Hume and Trimble were given the prize for their work in ending
the long guerrilla war in Northern Ireland, a process crowned by
an historic accord last April.
</P>
<P>
However, Ahern said "many other individuals, parties and
groups" were involved in "the arduous search for peace," and he
singled out Trimble's Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The 'Regulations on
Protecting Forest Land in Guangdong Province', which were passed
by the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress,
will take effect on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The provincial regulations follow the national Land Management
Law and local conditions and prohibit the destruction on forests
for the purpose of cultivating land, provide stricter controls on
use of forest land, deal with ownership of forests, and control
development of forests.
</P>
<P>
Their purpose is to improve protection and management of forest
land and ensure the stable development of forests, according to
officials concerned.
</P>
<P>
Although the province issued its 'Provisions on the Management
of Forest Lands' in as early as 1992, over 73,000 hectares of
forests were used for other purposes, 50 percent of which had
obtained no official approval from local forestry departments.

<HEADLINE> German Parliament OKs Warplanes for Kosovo Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The German parliament Friday
overwhelmingly endorsed a plan of the outgoing government headed
by Chancellor Helmut Kohl to send German warplanes and troops in
case of a NATO strike to defuse the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, 14 Tornado fighter jets and 500 soldiers of
Germany will participate in a possible NATO military intervention
if Yugoslavia fails to abide by a pledge to withdraw troops from
its southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The plan was approved by a vote of 503 to 63 with 18
abstentions at a special session of the outgoing parliament, which
normally should have been out of session after the election.
</P>
<P>
The newly-elected parliament will not convene its first session
until October 26.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary approval was widely expected beforehand,
given the support both from Kohl's Christian Democratic Union
(CDU) and from Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democratic Party (SPD),
which is poised to take over power in Bonn at the end of this
month.
</P>
<P>
However, the vote has been viewed as a foreign policy test for
Schroeder's new government, which apparently finds it
uncomfortable to be involved in a possible military action even
before taking office.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the parliamentary debates on Friday,
Chancellor-elect Schroeder said he is in favor of maintaining
military threat over Belgrade, though he believes that a NATO
attack now seems unnecessary after the compromise deal reached
between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder and his most likely junior coalition partner, the
Greens, initially told NATO allies that German troops would not be
able to take part in a military intervention in Kosovo any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
A necessary parliamentary approval would be difficult to
arrange during the current transition of government, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, under pressure from Washington and NATO, which insist
that Germany's Tornado warplanes equipped with special anti-radar
systems must take part, Bonn finally agreed to convene a special
session of the outgoing parliament for a vote on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The vote is particularly a test for the Greens party, which as
a opposition party had been strongly against any foreign
deployment of German troops.
</P>
<P>
Friday's debates highlighted the old split within the Greens
between the so-called "Fundis" and "Realos," the committed
pacifists and the pragmatists.
</P>
<P>
Joschka Fischer, the pragmatic Greens leader tipped as
Germany's prospective foreign minister, called on his party
members to vote for the bill to help prevent a humanitarian
disaster in Kosovo and also to prove Germany's ability to act
under a new government.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing parliament members of the Greens, however,
resisted the call and insisted that a United Nations resolution
approving the use of force should be the precondition for any
German participation in a NATO intervention.
</P>
<P>
"A military action without a legal basis would set a dangerous
precedent," said Ludger Volmer, a Greens expert of foreign
affairs.

<P>
CAIRO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A 12-man delegation comprising
Arab members of the Israeli Knesset (parliament) arrived in Cairo
Friday for a three-day visit, the first time for such a delegation
to visit an Arab state.
</P>
<P>
In an arrival statement to newsmen, Abdul Wahab Al Darawsha,
president of the Arab Democratic Party in Israel, said he expected
the on-going Washington meetings of Israeli, Palestinian and
U.S. leaders will end with a compromise formula.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat started their talks
in Washington on Thursday. An agreement on Israel's troops
redeployment in the West Bank is widely hoped for.
</P>
<P>
Darawsha said his delegation, which came at an invitation from
the Foreign Ministry, will call upon Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak to consolidate the relationship of the Arab Israelis with
the Arabs because Egypt constitutes the gate to the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
He added that the delegation will ask for Egypt's approval to
grant Arab Israeli students admission to the Egyptian universities.
</P>
<P>
He also said the position of the Arab deputies is identical to
that of Egypt regarding the Middle East peace process, saying they
are opposed to Israeli intransigent policy towards peace.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, India Hold "Frank, Cordial" Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Secretaries of
Pakistan and India on Friday had discussions in "frank, warm and
cordial atmosphere" on issues of peace and security, a Pakistani
Foreign Office spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press briefing Friday evening, the spokesman said
that the issues discussed during the first day talks also included
confidence building measures.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman declined to disclose details of the
discussion on the measures. He said that technical experts from
the two sides are still holding discussions on the measure which
will help reduce the tension between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Shamshad
Ahmed said that the two sides were in the middle of discussions
and would continue to identify issues relating to peace and
security and confidence building.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the media prior to the first session of the talks
which were resumed after a year-long deadlock, Shamshad Ahmad said
that he was not expecting any "quick-fix solution" to the
outstanding issues including Kashmir between Islamabad and New
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad had a four-hour-long meeting with his Indian
counterpart K. Ragunath at a government guest house here Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going in for any quick-fix solution," Shamshad
said.
</P>
<P>
The neighboring Pakistan and India need to build a friendly
relationship and the talks is the first step toward that
direction, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India, following their tit-fro-tat nuclear
explosions in May this year, also need to develop a regime for
mutual restraint, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not expect results just from one meeting. We are just
initiating the process and we will try to bring the process to a
logical conclusion as soon as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no substitute for talks in seeking durable solutions
to disputes," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, the Indian foreign secretary shunned the reporters'
questions.
</P>
<P>
Friday's talks focused mainly on the issues of regional peace
and security which top the eight-point agenda agreed by the two
countries during their talks in Islamabad last June.
</P>
<P>
Talks on Saturday will be devoted solely to the Jammu and
Kashmir issue which has bedeviled the relations between the two
South Asian nations for the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
A closing session is set for Sunday morning which will be
followed by a press conference. A joint statement is expected
after the closing session.
</P>
<P>
Another round of talks will be held in New Delhi next month to
discuss other bilateral issues between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Tax Costs Double for Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A new consumer tax sought by
the Australian government will make Sydney Olympic Games
organizers double the potential cost to 200 million dollars (120
million US), it was reported today.
</P>
<P>
New South Wales Olympics Minister Michael Knight said that was
90 million dollars (54 million US) more than he estimated last
week when Treasurer Peter Costello first raised the possibility
of introducing the tax on July 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
A 10 percent Goods and Services tax (GST) would be in place
for the 2000 Games, the government indicated last week.
</P>
<P>
Knight said the Olympics should be exempt from the tax because
they were bringing in one billion Australian dollars (600 million
US dollars) additional tax revenue to Australia.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Canada Cuts Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Canada lowered its
bank rate by a quarter of one percentage point to 5.5 percent
Friday, following Thursday's quarter-point rate cuts by
U.S. Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
Major Canadian banks responded to the cut by saying that they
will lower their prime rate -- the rate charged their best
corporate customers -- to 7.0 percent from 7.25 percent effective
Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in less than a month that the Bank of
Canada cut its rate. On September 29, it lowered its short-term
rate to 5.75 percent from 6.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Bank of Canada that Thursday's action by
the Federal Reserve was taken "to sustain economic growth against
a backdrop of growing caution by U.S. lenders and unsettled
conditions in financial markets more generally."
</P>
<P>
"Given the implications of these U.S. economic and financial
market developments, and in the context of low and stable
inflation in Canada, a similar one-quarter of one percentage point
decline in Canadian short-term rates was judged appropriate," the
bank said.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Adopt More Restricted Rule over Blood Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- People who since 1980 have lived
in parts of the world with significant rates of mad-cow disease,
namely Britain, should not be allowed to donate blood in Canada, a
Canadian bioethics group said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to create undue concern, but this is the prudent
thing to do," said Burleigh Trevor-Deutsch, chairman of the Bayer
advisory council on bioethics.
</P>
<P>
The ban, if adopted by regulators, could affect hundreds of
thousand people, but it is still unclear what kind of effect it
would bring about upon blood collection, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there is no solid evidence that the human
brain-wasting condition Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), known as
"mad-human disease," is transmitted by blood or blood
products. But a new variant of CJD, believed to be contracted by
eating beef contaminated with mad-cow disease, might be
transmissible in that way theoretically.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, there were already 27 cases of CJD reported in
Britain, one in France, but none in Canada.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Star Spoils Gatien's Birthday Party (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, China, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Former world champion
Jean-Philippe Gatien had to swallow bitterness on his 30th
birthday as Chinese Ma Lin stopped his last-ditch run at the
World Cup table tennis tournament here Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Ma, 1996 Asian Cup winner, forced the
Frenchman out of the contention with a 21-19, 21-9 victory, the
second in his three Group B matches which is good enough to
secure a quarter-final berth.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese penhold player, ranked 11th in the world, joined
teammates Kong Linghui and Liu Guoliang in the last eight.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's reigning world champion Jan-Ove Waldner and world
number one Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus, and 1993 and 1997 World
Cup winner Zoran Primorac of Croatia all have booked their
quarter-final spots earlier.
</P>
<P>
Ma led 10-4, 20-17 in the first set with great serving,
crushing forehands and deft drops. But the eighth-ranked Gatien
came back strongly to save two set points before he missed an
easy kill to go one set down.
</P>
<P>
The hard-fought set win boosted Ma's morale as he turned up
heat to win the following set with a large margin.
</P>
<P>
Gatien was philosophical with his defeat.
</P>
<P>
"Ma is just better than me," said the lefthanded attacker, who
had a series of mistimed hits and inaccurate forehand loops in
the second set.
</P>
<P>
Waldner, who has been at the top for 15 years and who made his
breakthrough as a 16-year-old by reaching the 1982 European
championship final, moved into the quarter-finals by outlasting
Kalinikos Kreanga of Greece 24-22, 19-21, 21-19.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Swede, who had beaten Australia's Oceanian
champion Mark Smythe and Samsonov, trailed 14-16 in the third set
against the Greek, whose backhand can stun opponents and requires
split second timing.
</P>
<P>
Waldner levelled the score at 19-19 and then set up two easy
kills with the deceptive serves to nail the victory.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Kim Taek Soo edged out Sweden's Peter Karlsson
15-21, 21-19, 21-19 to record two wins against one loss, joining
the unbeaten Group C seed Primorac in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
"The game was so close, I was just lucky," said the
ninth-ranked Kim after the match.
</P>
<P>
German Jorg Rosskopf, who lost to Olympic champion Liu
Guoliang on Thursday, grabbed two wins Friday afternoon and
joined the Chinese fast-attacker in the last eight.
</P>
<P>
The lefthanded German, whose ferocious backhand is stronger
than many of his peer's forehand, nipped former world number one
Jean-Michel Saive of Belgium 21-19, 21-19 after crushing Canadian
Johnny Huang 21-13, 23-21.
</P>
<P>
Huang, ranked 17th in the world, withdrew from the last group
match against Liu Guoliang Friday night, citing an injury
sustained this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In the other three matches Friday night, Samsonov downed the
221st-ranked Smythe 21-14, 21-10, Kong beat African champion Ali
Saleh of Egypt 21-11, 22-20, and Primorac nipped Liu Song of
Argentina 21-17, 21-15.

<HEADLINE> Situation Of Disabled Persons In China Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- China has greatly improved the
livelihoods of the disabled over the past decade, according to
Deng Pufang, chairman of the China Disabled Persons' Federation
(CDPF).
</P>
<P>
Deng told today's opening ceremony of the Third National
Congress of the CDPF that 4.16 million disabled people have
benefited from nationwide rehabilitation programs that have helped
2.1 million cataract sufferers see again and 90,000 deaf-mute
children speak.
</P>
<P>
More than 600,000 people crippled by polio have been helped in
walking to varying extent and around 800,000 people with mental
disorders were helped to live more like ordinary people through
therapy, Deng, who is himself confined to a wheelchair, said.
</P>
<P>
Deng said the rapid development of special education has raised
the school enrollment rate of the blind, deaf and mentally-retarded
children from merely 6 percent 10 years ago to 64 percent today. And
about 1.5 million handicapped people have received professional
training.
</P>
<P>
He cited the rise in the employment of the disabled, from 50
percent to 73 percent, as a way of praising the nation's efforts
to ensure equal job opportunities for disabled people.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, artists with disabilities in China have also have
gone on performance tours in 20 countries and athletes with
disabilities won 1,291 golden medals in international sporting
events.
</P>
<P>
China is close to reaching its goal of eliminating polio
through massive immunization campaigns, and has spread the use of
iodized salt and iodine supplements among 90 million pregnant
women and infants in a further move to prevent and control birth
disorders.
</P>
<P>
More ordinary people have become involved in the activities to
help the disabled, especially since the annual National Day for
Helping the Disabled was started eight years ago, Deng said.

<HEADLINE> Flynn: Employment Key to Alleviate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- European Union Commissioner
for Employment and Social Affairs Padraig Flynn said Friday that
employment is the central task for reintegrating those living
under the poverty line back into society.
</P>
<P>
To mark the International Day Against Poverty, which falls on
October 17, Flynn stressed the need for social policies which can
not only alleviate poverty, but can also actively help integrate
those poor people back to work and society.
</P>
<P>
The recently adopted guidelines for EU member states'
employment policies in 1999 emphasize the need to make sure that
national tax, benefit and training systems actively support
employability, and that national employment policies pay special
attention to the needs of those people and groups who have
particular difficulty in accessing the labor market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to poverty in Europe, Flynn said, "poverty remains a
scourge of society in Europe as well as elsewhere in the world."
</P>
<P>
Flynn added that he would encourage a policy aimed at tackling
the causes of poverty, not only simply diminishing the poverty.
</P>
<P>
According to latest figures available, about 17 percent of
European Union's households have incomes below the poverty line.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Internet Technology China (ITC)
and Beijing Horizon Research today announced a joint effort to
develop the on-line polling business in China.
</P>
<P>
This would mean a new era in polling in China and the rapid
development of the Internet has huge market potential.
</P>
<P>
Charles Zhang, 33, CEO and President of ITC, has been recently
named one of TIME's "Top Fifty Digerati." He says that on-line
polling is characterized by high speed, reduced research
intervention, better accuracy and low cost.
</P>
<P>
Sohoo, China's most popular Internet destination, which was
developed by ITC, has opened 14 Web-based user surveys that
profile the habits, opinions, and trends of the Internet users in
China, according to Sally Shi, marketing manager of ITC.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet provides a perfect platform for highly-targeted
market analysis and Sohoo, with a total of approximately two
million user sessions a month, provides the perfect subject pool
for such research," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that, since June 29, 1998, Sohoo has had a series of
online user surveys covering everything from divorce policies to
Internet trends and reactions.
</P>
<P>
China has now 1.5 million registered Internet users, with the
number estimated to reach 5 million by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Urges Neighbors to Strengthen Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand on Friday urged
neighboring countries hit by the regional economic turmoil to form
a "fortress Asia."
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Thai Deputy Prime Minister Bichai Rattakul
at the Council of Asian Liberal and Democrats Conference hosted by
the Thai ruling Democrat Party in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Bichai said the crisis gave regional governments an "incentive"
and "justification" to undergo their economic and political
reforms in line with international norms.
</P>
<P>
"We do not wish to see a fortress Asia that turns inward, but
an Asia that stays outward-looking and contributes to the growth
of the global economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the conference were delegates from Malaysia,
Singapore, Cambodia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Myanmar, South
Korea and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Singapore political scientist Hussin Mutalib, from the National
University of Singapore, called on regional governments to adopt a
"middle ground" approach -- between extremely open and closed
stances -- to solve the economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the conference said Thailand is hosting the
meeting to help mend rifts among certain member countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) over the detention
and trial of Malaysian former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Foreign Ministry has said Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
will attend the summit and foreign ministry officials noted that
ASEAN member countries should use this opportunity to strengthen
their unity.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The "East-West Cooperation"
program to encourage cooperation between rural enterprises in the
prosperous eastern regions and backward central and western areas,
has made some progress in the past three years by taking advantage
of abundant resources and labor in central and western China,
according to Jiang Yongtao, director of the Ministry of
Agriculture's Rural Enterprise Bureau.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the Ministry of Agriculture and the
Agricultural Bank of China had defined and started 228 cooperation
programs with a total cost of 1.6 billion yuan (193 million US
dollars). When these programs are put into operation, they will
have an estimated annual output of 17 billion yuan (2.05 billion
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Last year, earnings of 208 "East-West Cooperation" pilot zones
produced 105.56 billion yuan (12.75 billion US dollars), and their
growth was 10 percent higher than the average level in the central
and western areas, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The '98 East-West Cooperation Trade Talks are scheduled for
December 4-8 in Zhumadian prefecture in central China's Henan

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Issue New State Bonds Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand will issue
new five- and seven-year government bonds worth 100 billion baht
(2.63 billion U.S. dollars) next week, the Thai News Agency
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bonds, with an 8.25-percent interest, are intended to raise
funds for refinancing costly debts of Thailand's Financial
Institutions Development Fund.
</P>
<P>
The first weekly auction of at least 10 billion baht (263
million dollars) from the new batch would probably be made on
October 22.
</P>
<P>
The relatively low coupon rate of the new bonds, compared with
the 12.75 percent interest for an earlier batch of 200 billion
baht (5.26 billion dollars) issued a few months ago, reflected
improving liquidity in the Thai money market over the past few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The last portion of the previous batch of bonds amounting to
slightly over 12 billion baht (316 million dollars) is due for
auction Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing has
called on society to lend a helping hand to some 60 million
disabled persons to allow them to enjoy equal dignity and the same
rights as ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
Li told the opening ceremony of the Third National Congress of
the China Disabled Persons' Federation (CDPF) here today that
helping the disabled is an important symbol of civilization and
social progress.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting were Jiang Zemin, Zhu Rongji, Li
Ruihuan, Hu Jintao and Wei Jianxing.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan has sent a
letter of congratulation to the Congress, which was read at the
ceremony by Kerstin Leitner, resident coordinator of the UN
System's Operational Activities for Development.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Chinese government has always placed
importance on helping people with disabilities and a host of laws
have been passed to protect their rights and interests, and
working plans, organizations, and encouragement provided.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still a tough job helping the disabled, who
account for about 5 percent of the population, he said, and urged
Party committees and governments at all levels, as well as local
disabled persons' federations, to find practical ways to improve
the living conditions of people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
CDPF Chairman Deng Pufang spoke at the ceremony, which was
attended by 540 congress delegates, 65 percent of whom have
different kinds of disabilities.
</P>
<P>
"The congress will decide major tasks of the federation in the
next five years," Deng said. China plans to basically help all
disabled people have enough food and clothing by the end of this
century, and to launch a nationwide rehabilitation project and
help some 80 percent of the disabled children to go to school and
80 percent of the handicapped adults find jobs.
</P>
<P>
The four-day congress will adopt a revised constitution and
elect new leaders of the CDPF.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland's Election Threatened by Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rains, which have
been pounding most of Swaziland for two days, were threatening to
wash away the southern African kingdom's general election Friday,
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Chief electoral officer Robert Thwala said many dirt roads in
the mountainous country were impassable, making it impossible for
people to travel to polling stations, the report said.
</P>
<P>
One bridge in the Manzini area was flooded and buses and
trucks carrying would-be voters were reportedly stuck on the dirt
roads.
</P>
<P>
Thwala said his office and the attorney-general would meet
later Friday to decide what action to take. He said voting might
be extended to Saturday to allow for voting by those affected by
the rains.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations opened at 8 a.m. (0200 GMT) Friday and were
scheduled to close at 5 p.m. (1100 GMT).
</P>
<P>
More than 300 candidates, all named by King Mswati III, are
contesting 55 of 65 seats in the Swazi House of Assembly, and the
remaining 10 members of parliament will be appointed by the king.
</P>
<P>
The House of Assembly will elect 10 senators, and the other 20
will be appointed by the king, who will also choose a prime
minister and decide on selection of other cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
Opposition groups in the country have urged a boycott of the
poll, saying the non-party election is "a farce".
</P>
<P>
Political parties are banned in the tiny, landlocked kingdom,
sandwiched between South Africa and Mozambique. King Mswati III
rules the country as an absolute monarch - the last of his
kind in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Swazi government has declared Friday a paid public holiday
and urged people to ignore boycott calls and vote.

<HEADLINE> Business On Beijing's Russian Street Suffering From Ruble Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- For tourists and businessmen of
the former Soviet bloc, the significance of Yabaolu Street on the
east side of Beijing, can hardly be overstated.
</P>
<P>
This "Russian Street" is a venue for clothing deals with
exports worth about one billion U.S. dollars to Eastern Europe and
about 800 million U.S. dollars worth to Russia each year for the
past few years, according to statistics of the Chinese embassy in
Russia and Tianjin Customs. The exports to Russia account for half
the national total.
</P>
<P>
However, the street's wildly flourishing business scene quieted
down quite a lot because of the recession in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The volume of business is down 40 percent so far this year from
last year and 12 percent of the 3,000 stalls have closed down
temporarily or permanently, according to the management committee.
</P>
<P>
Hu Aichun, owner of stall No.6, says she has sold over 100,000
wool sweaters and jeans a year since 1992 when she set up the
stall, but for the first eight months of this year she sold only
20,000 items of clothing and had almost no business in August.
</P>
<P>
Hu and her colleagues say that they hardly saw any Russians on
the street from July to September but they have seen some since
mid-September when the ruble became relatively stable.
</P>
<P>
They said that the business would definitely be worse than last
year.
</P>
<P>
Like Yabaolu, Xiushui Street, with about 400 stalls, is another
major shopping venue for Western Europeans in Beijing. And, it has
also seen markedly less business this year, with fewer people
coming and sales down.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yonghua, owner of stall No. 33, says he sold 1,300 items
of clothing a month last year but in the first nine months of this
year, he sold only 1,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
He said that his customers are mainly Western European but some
are from Russia, Southeast Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Xu Zhongqing, owner of stall No. 46, sold 700 pairs of leather
shoes a month last year but this year the figure is 400. Xu
attributes to the slack in business to shrinking tourist flow and
says that his stall was visited by at least 100 people a day last
year but now there are 40-50 people.
</P>
<P>
On weekends, he sells 20 pairs of shoes a day at the most. The
record for last year was 50-60 pairs. He says he has neither
raised nor lowered prices.

<HEADLINE> Most Israelis Hope for Agreement in U.S. Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 16 (Xinhua) -- As the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations in the U.S. entered the second day, a Gallop poll in
Israel showed Friday that about 82 percent of the Israelis want
the talks to produce an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted the result of the poll, in which 1,000
Israelis were surveyed, as showing that only 13 percent of
Israelis hope no agreement will be reached in the talks. Five
percent of those surveyed said they have no ideas.
</P>
<P>
But only a slight majority, 52 percent of those surveyed,
believed that the two sides will clinch a deal in the U.S. talks,
which started Thursday at Wye Plantation near Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration hopes the talks could result in a
new interim agreement under which Israel will pullback its troops
from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
concrete Palestinian measures to clamp down on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
About 57 percent of those surveyed in the poll favor a Israeli
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, and 30 percent oppose
this scope of redeployment, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hardliners in the Israeli coalition stepped up
their pressure Friday on Netanyahu amid reports that Israel and
the Palestinians are close to an agreement in the talks.
</P>
<P>
The National Religious Party, the extreme rightist partner in
the government, was asking Netanyahu to return from the U.S.
immediately, saying that the talks were "disconnected from
reality."
</P>
<P>
Deputy Education Minister Moshe Peled, from the coalition
party of Tzomet, also issued a statement blaming Netanyahu for
abandoning security interests of Israel, saying he was
transferring the decision on security matters to the U.S..
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Labor Party reiterated in a statement
its support for an agreement with the Palestinians, saying that it
does not recommend that Netanyahu return for the opening of the
Knesset (Parliament)'s winter session next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, dozens of Israelis living in a Jewish settlement
near the West Bank town of Ramallah blocked entrance roads to the
Palestinian-ruled town for several hours, alleging that two
settlement security officers were beaten by Palestinian police
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The settlers said the two officers were chasing stone-throwers
into Ramallah when they were stopped and beaten by Palestinian
police. They demanded the Israeli army to do "more than merely
issuing a protest to the Palestinians," asking the military forces
to impose a curfew on Ramallah, Israel Radio said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Urged to Comply with Historical Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Qian Weichang, chairman of the
China Council for Promoting Peaceful Reunification, told a panel
on the council's 10th founding anniversary today that Taiwan
Authorities should comply with the historical trend and the will
of the Chinese people and end the state of hostility across the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Qian, also vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said
that Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang Party should respond to the
proposition of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and hold
political talks to open direct mail, trade, air, and shipping
services.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the panel were Cheng Siyuan, vice-chairman of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),
and CPPCC National Committee vice-chairmen Wan Guoquan, Jing
Shuping and Luo Haocai.
</P>
<P>
The council was founded in September 1988 by non-communist
parties and other prominent people without any party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, it has received more than 10,000
compatriots and over 100 delegations from Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Macao. A Peaceful Reunification Foundation has been established,
with the financial assistance of local people and overseas
Chinese.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Allows Foreigners to Hold 100 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
allowing foreign investors to hold a 100 percent stake in the
country's commercial banks in a move that aims to speed up its
economic recovery program, according to Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia Governor Sjahril Sabirin told a House of
Representatives plenary session on amendments to Law No. 7/1992 on
the banking system on Friday that under this difficult economic
situation, the government will not restrict capital inflow.
</P>
<P>
The four factions of the House approved the amendments.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor said foreign investors who intend to
set up a new bank must cooperate with their Indonesian
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The four factions expressed the hope that the government would
give priority to allowing foreign investors to buy the shares of
Indonesian banks instead of licensing new foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
Licensing new commercial banks will only impede the
government's effort to lower the number of insolvent banks, said
spokesman for the United Development Party faction Daniel
Tandjung.
</P>
<P>
The four factions also expressed the hope that the government
would pay more attention to small-scale companies and cooperatives
in giving bank loans.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Speaker Survives Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Lower House Speaker
Ram Chandra Poudel survived Friday a motion tabled by the
opposition parties accusing him of partisan conduct.
</P>
<P>
The motion was defeated 123-55 in the 205-member house, where
Poudel's Nepali Congress (NC) and its ruling partner Communist
Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) hold a comfortable
majority.
</P>
<P>
The faction of the National Democratic Party led by former
prime minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand also threw its weight behind
the ruling parties.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) and its allies tabled the motion on
September 23, accusing the speaker of partisan conduct in
conducting voice voting on the controversial Local Autonomy Bill
on September 17. They criticized the speaker for declaring the
bill passage in the house when the opposition MPs were voicing
protest against it.
</P>
<P>
The bill has been passed in both houses of parliament and
presented to the king for approval.
</P>
<P>
In a tit-for-tat move, the ruling NC and the CPN-ML tabled a
motion against the then deputy speaker Lila Subba Shrestha from
the CPN-UML.
</P>
<P>
Poudel had refused to apologize or step down while the
opposition had rejected compromise and a proposal by the ruling
parties that both sides withdraw their motions.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Shrestha resigned last Saturday to avoid the
humiliation of forced resignation, as her party and its allies
could not garner a two-thirds majority in the Lower House to
defeat the motion against her.
</P>
<P>
Her resignation had made the house session adjourned for
several days until Bhoj Raj Joshi from the CPN-ML was elected
Wednesday to fill in the vacant post.
</P>
<P>
Under the chairmanship of Joshi, the house concluded Thursday
discussions on the motion against the speaker.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML had threatened to make all its lawmakers to resign
en masse as an ultimate measure.
</P>
<P>
But this does not necessarily mean the end of the majority
government, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
However, confrontation between the two sides is expected to
continue in parliament before its term expires in November 1999.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Star Spoils Gatien's Birthday Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, China, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Former world champion
Jean-Philippe Gatien had to swallow bitterness on his 30th
birthday as Chinese Ma Lin stopped his last-ditch run at the
World Cup table tennis tournament here Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Ma, 1996 Asian Cup winner, forced the
Frenchman out of the contention with a 21-19, 21-9 victory, the
second in his three Group B matches which is good enough to
secure a quarter-final berth.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese penhold player, ranked 11th in the world, joined
teammates Kong Linghui and Liu Guoliang in the last eight.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's reigning world champion Jan-Ove Waldner and world
number one Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus, and 1993 and 1997 World
Cup winner Zoran Primorac of Croatia all have booked their
quarter-final spots earlier.
</P>
<P>
Ma led 10-4, 20-17 in the first set with great serving,
crushing forehands and deft drops. But the eighth-ranked Gatien
came back strongly to save two set points before he missed an
easy kill to go one set down.
</P>
<P>
The hard-fought set win boosted Ma's morale as he turned up
heat to win the following set with a large margin.
</P>
<P>
Gatien was philosophical with his defeat.
</P>
<P>
"Ma is just better than me," said the lefthanded attacker, who
had a series of mistimed hits and inaccurate forehand loops in
the second set.
</P>
<P>
Waldner, who has been at the top for 15 years and who made his
breakthrough as a 16-year-old by reaching the 1982 European
championship final, moved into the quarter-finals by outlasting
Kalinikos Kreanga of Greece 24-22, 19-21, 21-19.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Swede, who had beaten Australia's Oceanian
champion Mark Smythe and Samsonov, trailed 14-16 in the third set
against the Greek, whose backhand can stun opponents and requires
split second timing.
</P>
<P>
Waldner levelled the score at 19-19 and then set up two easy
kills with the deceptive serves to nail the victory.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Kim Taek Soo edged out Sweden's Peter Karlsson
15-21, 21-19, 21-19 to record two wins against one loss, joining
unbeaten Group C seed Primorac in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
"The game was so close, I was just lucky," said the
ninth-ranked Kim after the match.
</P>
<P>
German Jorg Rosskopf, who lost to Olympic champion Liu
Guoliang on Thursday, grabbed two wins Friday afternoon
and joined the Chinese fast-attacker in the last eight.
</P>
<P>
The lefthanded German, whose ferocious backhand is stronger
than many of his peer's forehand, nipped former world number one
Jean-Michel Saive of Belgium 21-19, 21-19 after crushing Canadian
Johnny Huang 21-13, 23-21.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland's Election Threatened by Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rains, which have
been pounding most of Swaziland for two days, were threatening to
wash away the southern African kingdom's general election Friday,
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Chief electoral officer Robert Thwala said many dirt roads in
the mountainous country were impassable, making it impossible for
people to travel to polling stations, the report said.
</P>
<P>
One bridge in the Manzini area was flooded and buses and
trucks carrying would-be voters were reportedly stuck on the dirt
roads.
</P>
<P>
Thwala said his office and the attorney-general would meet
later Friday to decide what action to take. He said voting might
be extended to Saturday to allow for voting by those affected by
the rains.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations opened at 8 a.m. (0200 GMT) Friday and were
scheduled to close at 5 p.m. (1100 GMT).
</P>
<P>
More than 300 candidates, all named by King Mswati III, are
contesting 55 of 65 seats in the Swazi House of Assembly, and the
remaining 10 members of parliament will be appointed by the king.
</P>
<P>
The House of Assembly will elect 10 senators, and the other 20
will be appointed by the king, who will also choose a prime
minister and decide on selection of other cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
Opposition groups in the country have urged a boycott of the
poll, saying the non-party election is "a farce".
</P>
<P>
Political parties are banned in the tiny, landlocked kingdom,
sandwiched between South Africa and Mozambique. King Mswati III
rules the country as an absolute monarch - the last of his
kind in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Swazi government has declared Friday a paid public holiday
and urged people to ignore boycott calls and vote.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Organizers Bid to Have Exemption Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Sydney 2000 Olympics organizers
would start talks with the government in a bid to shy away from a
radical tax reform package, said an official on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the 10-percent goods and service tax(GST)
planned by the Australian government could cost the Games
organizers up to 200 million Austraian dollars (126 million
U.S.dollars), almost double the previous estimate of the effects
of the new package, due to come into force two months before the
Games kick off in September, 2000.
</P>
<P>
New South Wales state Olympics Minister Michael Knight said
the Games were exempt from income tax and wholesale sales tax
under Australia's current complicated taxation system.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters talks would soon start with the government
in an effort to have such exemptions extended to cover the GST.
</P>
<P>
"We'd effectively like to carry over the exemption we have for
wholesale sales tax and income tax, two taxes which have been in
whole or in part replaced by GST," Knight said, who is also
president of the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Sunday he wanted
the new tax in place before the Olympics to dip into the pockets
of the thousands of visitors expected for the Games.
</P>
<P>
Conservative Prime Minister John Howard promoted heavily
during the recent election campaign the urgent need for taxation
reform, basing his push for re-election on the GST.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Eyes More Jobs for Returning Female OFWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
stepping up its efforts to provide employment opportunities for
female overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who wish to return home, a
presidential press release said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The press release said the initiative is part of the programs
the Joseph Estrada administration has vowed to implement to help
erase the chronic gender bias that has barred Filipino women from
achieving genuine empowerment.
</P>
<P>
It added that President Estrada bared the initiative following
his recent state visit to Singapore, where he met with over 3,000
overseas workers and reiterated his government's commitment toward
furthering the interests of OFWs.
</P>
<P>
"Since our women are among those severely affected by the
financial crisis now gripping Asia, we have to intensify efforts
to provide for increased training and resources to increase
employment for women," the president was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We must accelerate programs to enable women to benefit fully
from our globalizing economy, while at the same time providing a
more effective social safety net to support women during economic
downturns," he said.
</P>
<P>
To support the career development of women, the government has
carried out a set of programs including requiring government
offices to submit women candidates for government positions to
ensure that women are given equal career opportunities with those
of their male counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has about 6 million overseas workers in at
least 100 countries and regions. More than half of them are female
and due to the ongoing Asian financial crisis, some of them were
sacked and have come back home.

<P>
The HSI entered the week's trading after strong gains last
week. The Index climbed back to the 9,000-point level Tuesday

1.87 percent due to profit-taking Wednesday, the index rose 130.41
points, or 1.48 percent, to finish at 8,970.42 Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Mid-Year Gems Emporium Opens in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar opened its Seventh
Mid-Year Gems Emporium here Friday to attract local and foreign
gems merchants with locally-produced gems, jade, pearl and
jewelry.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 gems merchants of 64 companies from 14 countries and
regions, mostly from China and its Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, Thailand, Japan and Malaysia, are attending
the emporium.
</P>
<P>
At the one-week state-sponsored emporium, a total of 11.34
million U.S. dollars worth of gems, jade, pearl and jewelry are
for sale at fixed prices and through competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
Local private companies put on sale 8.12 million dollars worth
of items or nearly 80 percent of the exhibited products.
</P>
<P>
The prices of the products are being reduced 5-10 percent due
to the Asian financial crisis, Deputy Minister of Mines U Myint
Thein said at a press conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
U Myint Thein, who is also chairman of the Central Committee
for holding the emporium, disclosed that the government is making
preparations to allow gems trading and transport through two
border towns -- Muse and Lwaigyai. Now gems trading is only
allowed in the capital of Yangon.
</P>
<P>
At the Sixth Mid-Year Gems Emporium in October last year a
total of 11.66 million dollars worth of gems, jade, pearl and
jewelry were put on sale.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, a well-known producer of jade, ruby and sapphire, has
been holding gems emporiums annually since 1964 with additional
mid-year ones introduced in the past six years since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar earned more than 260 million dollars from the last 35
annual and six mid-year gems emporiums.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar promulgated a new gemstone law in September 1995,
allowing local entrepreneurs to mine, produce, transport and sell
finished gemstone and manufactured jewelry at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The government also set up joint-ventures with companies from
Thailand, Malaysia and Israel for the activities.

<P>
MACAO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Cartographic and
Cadastral Department will work together with the Guangdong
Provincial State Land Department to conduct aerial photography
over Macao.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed a relevant agreement earlier this week,
according to Lei Song Fan, vice-director of the Macao department.
The State Land Department of Guangdong will make an aerial survey
of the Pearl River Delta soon.
</P>
<P>
The vice-director explained that it is not necessary for Macao
to conduct airborne cadastral survey frequently and independently,
for Macao only has a total land area of 23 square kilometers in
its one peninsula and two islands.
</P>
<P>
The survey will be carried out in bright days in late October
up to January next year. A photographical airplane will have color
pictures of Macao with a surveying scale of 1:10,000 which will
better demonstrate the overall landscape.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the Land Department of Guangdong helped Macao with the
latter's land survey for the first time, turning out
white-and-black pictures with a scale of 1:3,000.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Expresses Regret at Moody's Assessment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Friday complained to
Moody's Investor Service, U.S. credit rating agency, of its
latest assessment of the nation's economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
"It is regrettable that the recent review was based on data
before the Korean government injected funds into the banking
sector," said the Finance and Economy Ministry in a letter to
the New York-based Moody's.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, Moody's said the credit-quality outlook for South
Korean banking system remained negative despite the nation's
efforts to overhaul the ailing financial system
</P>
<P>
"The asset-quality future is bleak, liquidity remains tight,
profitability thin and, most urgently, capital is scarce," said
the U.S. rating agency.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry said the inter-bank call rate is down to
the seven percent level and corporate bond rates down to 10
percent level.
</P>
<P>
Last month, South Korea major banks' capital adequacy ratio
went up to 10-13 percent in accordance with the Bank for
International Settlements standards after the government provided
15.8 billion U.S. dollars to the banks.
</P>
<P>
The Moody's view of South Korean banks as "technically
insolvent" therefore is inaccurate and its judgement of the bad
loans in the banking system as hitting 40 percent against the
gross domestic product is also wrong, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry required the U.S. rating agency draw up a
supplementary report after conducting a fresh investigation next
month and make public its results.

BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu
Jintao told visiting Singaporean Foreign Minister Shunmugam
Jayakumar here today that China is ready to foster a
good-neighborly, mutually-trust and cooperative Sino-Singaporean
relationship oriented to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that Sino-Singaporean ties have registered smooth
progress with expanded fields of bilateral cooperation in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar, who is also Singaporean minister for law, said
Singapore-China cooperation has been moving smoothly although the
two countries forged diplomatic relations not long
before. Singapore is also ready to bring bilateral collaboration,
especially in the field of economic and trade, up to new levels,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Asian financial crises, Hu said that China, as
a responsible country, has spared no effort to help stablize the
Asian economy and ease the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
China would realize the sustained and steady growth of its
national economy through a number of measures including increasing
investment and expanding domestic demand, Hu said, pledging that
the RMB (Chinese Yuan) will not devalue.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar told Hu that Singapore and the other ASEAN nations
felt grateful for China's responsible approach in dealing with the
Asian financial crisis. The fact that China maintains the
stability of the RMB rate has played a major role in stablizing
that regional economic and financial situation.
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar conveyed an invitation from Singaporean President Ong
Teng Cheong inviting Hu to visit Singapore and Hu expressed thanks
for this.

<HEADLINE> U.N.-Sponsored Shuttle Talks Launched in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Resident Representative
Dame Ann Hercus launched her shuttle diplomacy between rival Greek
and Turkish Cypriot communities Friday with a meeting with Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement after her 50-minute meeting at the
Presidential Palace, the U.N. envoy said she will have her first
meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash next Wednesday
before another meeting with Clerides a day later.
</P>
<P>
Hercus refrained from disclosing details of the meeting. She
has said she would be pursuing her shuttle talks in absolute
confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
But press reporters here said that the U.N.-sponsored
on-island shuttle talks are aimed at breaking the deadlock on the
protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus peace talks have remained closed since Denktash
walked out of a U.N.-sponsored inter-communal talks in Switzerland
a year ago to protest against a European Union decision to start
accession talks with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced last month, after
meeting separately Clerides and Denktash in New York, that Hercus
would develop a "process for on-island contacts with both parties
with the goal of reducing tensions and promoting progress toward a
just and lasting settlement."
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led international community has been trying for
decades to reunite the island through a bi-zonal, bi-communal
federation formula, but so far no tangible results have been
achieved.

LAGOS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Inflation rate in Nigeria rose
to 7.3 percent in August from 6.6 percent in July, the Federal
Office of Statistics has said.
</P>
<P>
This is the third consecutive month that Nigeria has recorded
a rise in the inflation rate, which was put at 6.3 percent in May
and 6.4 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has recorded a remarkable achievement in the last few
years in curbing high inflation, but some believe a low inflation
rate, combined with tight fiscal policy and poor purchasing
power, might not be a good thing to the economy.
</P>
<P>
There is also a prevailing fear that the government's
announcement of a large scale increase in civil servants' salary
might spark off serious inflation.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- With next year's general
election around the corner, South Africa's biggest opposition
party, the National Party (NP), has suffered another blow when a
senior member quit it, The Star paper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Gerhard Koornhof, the NP chief whip in the National Council of
Provinces, South Africa's upper house of parliament, defected
Thursday to the United Democratic Movement (UDM), another

former NP leader in Gauteng Province, and a number of other NP
members earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Koornhof said he was inspired to enter politics by the ex-NP
leader F.W. de Klerk's speech in February 1990, but now found the
party was stagnating.
</P>
<P>
He said he was prepared to sacrifice his monthly salary of
20,000 Rand (3,500 U.S. Dollars) as an MP to become a voluntary
worker for the UDM, as he believed it was the only party that
could challenge the ruling African National Congress (ANC) for
votes from blacks.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the news, the ANC said continuing defections from
the NP meant the time had come to "blow out the candle of this
archaic party."
</P>
<P>
The NP, which governed South Africa during decades of
apartheid rule before 1994, has seen its popularity steadily
falling in the past year. Latest poll has found the party's
support sank to an all-time low of 10 percent while other
opposition parties enjoyed increasing support.

<HEADLINE> Blair Praises Northern Irish Nobel Peace Prize Winners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) - British Prime Minister Tony Blair
praised Friday the Northern Irish politicians who won the Nobel
Peace Prize, saying the award could help overcome the remaining
obstacles to peace in the area.
</P>
<P>
"There could be no more worthy winners of the Nobel peace prize
than John Hume and David Trimble," Blair said in a statement
issued by the Downing Street office.
</P>
<P>
"This is a recognition of their courage and their qualities of
leadership that were so vital to laying the road to peace," Blair
said.
</P>
<P>
Hume and Trimble were given the prize for their work in ending
the long guerrilla war in Northern Ireland, a process marked by a
historic peace accord this last April.
</P>
<P>
Blair called the Nobel award "a prize in which all the people
of Northern Ireland can feel immense pride and credit," adding
that "they more than anyone will know that the task of building
peace in Northern Ireland is not yet complete."
</P>
<P>
"But this award can serve as a spur to overcoming the remaining
difficulties as we try to build a lasting peace," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Women's Role Vital in Food Production: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Women play a central role in
Uganda's food production and they are crucial in the nutrition of
the family and population because they determine the menu for the
family, according to a Ministry of Health report.
</P>
<P>
The report carried in Friday's Monitor newspaper said Ugandan
women provide 60 percent of the labor and account for over 80
percent in food production.
</P>
<P>
They are responsible for 60 percent of planting, 70 percent of
weeding and digging, 60 percent of harvesting, 90 percent of
preparation and processing of food and 80 percent of marketing of
crops, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the female population carry out a multitude of
other domestic activities. They are majorly responsible for
looking after family welfare and collecting 90 percent of the
fire wood besides cleaning the house and doing the washing for
the whole family.
</P>
<P>
Women are also involved in income generating activities at
both formal and informal levels to supplement the family income,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said 90 percent of urban women and 50 percent of rural
women are out to supplement the family income.
</P>
<P>
Although women are the prime cultivators of basic foods, they
are physically weak and demoralized.
</P>
<P>
"Since our goal in this country is to ensure availability of
adequate food, both in quality and quantity for all people at all
times, there is urgent need to alleviate the constraints faced by
women in the production of resources and to share in the
workload," the report noted.
</P>
<P>
people are urged to pay more attention to women who are vital
instruments in solving the food crisis problems and contributing
to a healthy nation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations' Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) Regional Office for Asia and the
Pacific celebrated the 18th World Food Day here Friday by

</P>
<P>
To highlight the theme of this year's World Food Day, "Women
Feed the World", four women from China, Indonesia, the Maldives

rural communities, and has supported integration of their
interests and needs through policy advice to member countries,
programs and special activities," he said.

Meanwhile, Princess Sirindhorn in her speech called for
appropriate education for rural women, saying it will bring
benefits to all household members as well as the community.

<HEADLINE> S. Africans to Pay More for Local Phone Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africans will pay
an average of 19.2 percent more for local phone calls next year
as the state telecommunication company, Telkom, planned the third
successive annual above-inflation rate hike.
</P>
<P>
But international call rates will fall by 8.1 percent next
March, and Telkom outlined a total reduction in international
calls of 24 percent for next year, Business Day paper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
National call rates will not change, the report quoted the
company as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Telkom raised the cost of local calls by 28.4 percent last
year and by 25 percent this year. A three-minute local call
currently costs 38.6 cents (6.8 U.S. cents).
</P>
<P>
The company said the hefty increases were necessary as the low
price of local calls had not covered the real cost to Telkom.
Local calls had been subsidized by national and international
calls.
</P>
<P>
Telkom will also introduce a new call billing system from
January which will charge customers by second of talk time
instead of by metered unit. Consumers will pay a minimum charge
of 46 cents (8 U.S. cents) for all calls.
</P>
<P>
Telkom said the overall increase in telephone rates from
January would be 5.5 percent, lower than the projected inflation
rate of 8.8 percent for January 1999.

<HEADLINE> China Confident Of Meeting Economic Growth Target  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- China today reaffirmed its
confidence in meeting this year's economic growth target as more
clear signs of a recovery surface.
</P>
<P>
The country's gross domestic product grew 7.2 percent on a
yearly basis to more than 5.44 trillion yuan (about 655.8 billion
U.S. dollars) in the first three quarters of this year, up 0.2
percent from that in the first six months, the State Statistics
Bureau (SSB) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Although the growth rate for the first three quarters is 0.8
percentage points below the official target of eight percent,
economic growth is picking up month by month. The GDP growth rate
for the third quarter was 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Many officials and experts here said they are optimistic about
China's chances of meeting its economic growth target by year's
end.
</P>
<P>
"As we increase investment in basic construction, and
reconstruction of the flood-ravaged areas accelerates, the
national economy is expected to pick up considerably in the fourth
quarter and the growth target for the whole of this year is
attainable," SSB spokesman Ye Zhen said at a press conference this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
SSB figures revealed today show that China invested 503.6
billion yuan in fixed assets in the third quarter of this year, an
increase of 28.2 percent from the same period last year. This
growth rate is 14.4 percentage points higher than that for the
first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Total investment in fixed assets for the first nine months was
1.086 trillion yuan, up 20 percent from the corresponding period
last year.

<P>
The national economy has been smooth in the first nine months,
with production and investment clearly recovering in the third
quarter, Ye said, attributing the recovery to the effective
implementation of government policies to increase investment and
consumer demand and to encourage exports.
</P>
<P>
Kathie Krumm, chief economist of the World Bank Resident
Mission in China, expresses her guarded optimism about the Chinese
economy, saying "the SSB indicators revealed today clearly
indicate that a recovery of the Chinese economy has begun."
</P>
<P>
It is "technically feasible" for China to achieve this year's
economic growth target should there be continuing economic
recovery and higher growth in the fourth quarter, she said.
</P>
<P>
She added that an increase in growth in the state-owned sector
and in investment is a sign that China's public investment program
and fiscal stimulus strategy are beginning to show results and
will have a greater impact in later years.
</P>
<P>
An official study, meanwhile, shows that as the Chinese economy
improved, consumer confidence rose 1.8 points from August to 91.2
points in September.
</P>
<P>
"The rising index indicates that though the Chinese economy is
confronting unprecedented challenges, consumers are upbeat about
the economic development trends," an economist here said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Leading Newspaper Hails Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's leading newspaper Nhan
Dan Friday carried an article, hailing the new development of the
Sino-Vietnamese relations of friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The article is written by Deputy President of the Vietnam-China
Friendship Organization Dinh Nho Liem in anticipation of the
upcoming five-day official visit to China by Vietnamese Prime
Minister Phan Van Khai beginning next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Liem said the visit is a continuation of bilateral exchange
visits by leaders of Vietnam and China since the two countries
resumed normal relations in late 1991.
</P>
<P>
The author noted both Vietnam and China have worked hard to
stabilize the political situation and boost socio-economic
development so as to improve the living conditions of their
people, and gain significant achievements.
</P>
<P>
He described similarities in the two countries' renovation
policy, namely:
</P>
<P>
- To be persistent in pursuing socialism characterized by their
own specific conditions;
</P>
<P>
- To carry out a renovation and open policy to boost economic
development and stabilize the political situation;
</P>
<P>
- To effectively mobilize domestic resources while making full
use of international cooperation; and
</P>
<P>
- To continue leadership by the communist party.
</P>
<P>
During the upcoming visit to China, Prime Minister Khai and his
Chinese counterpart Zhu Rongji are expected to focus their talks
on how to boost mutual understanding and trust between the two
countries, Liem said.
</P>
<P>
He said Vietnam highly appreciates China's experience in
building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
In order to boost bilateral cooperation between the two
countries, Vietnam "has been striving to turn the Sino-Vietnamese
border into an area of peace and friendship so that the two
nations could live in independence, sovereignty, peace and
stability for their younger generations," he added.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Rise Sharply After U.S. Rate Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- An unexpected cut in U.S.
interest rates and the expectation of a similar easing here saw
the Australian stock market rise sharply Friday.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries quickly rose by two percent in morning trade
before plateauing to finish 52.1 points higher at 2,511.4 as
sellers matched buyers in trading.
</P>
<P>
The buyers were responding to the U.S. rate cut of 25 basis
points and a related 7.5 percent surge in Hong Kong morning trade.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng index gained 806.59 points to close at 9,777.01,
breaching the 9,670.45-point level it touched on May 21.
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average posted
its first gain in four trading days, advancing 285.17 points, or
2.19 percent, to close at 13,280.54.
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the intra-day position, we (the Australian
stock market) rose at the beginning, had a little bit of a glitch
there at one stage and then basically went flat out all day,"
Trevor Cain from PG Intercapital said.
</P>
<P>
Banking stocks were the obvious beneficiaries of the rate
reduction, while elsewhere gold stocks posted strong rises as the
spot price again moved above 300 U.S. dollars per ounce.
</P>
<P>
The gold bullion price in Sydney closed at 300.15 dollars an
ounce, compared with Thursday's close of 296.50.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index finished 89.4 points higher at
4,360.6, with the banking index surging three percent.
</P>
<P>
Westpac's 43.9 cents rise to 9.05 Australian dollars was the
most pronounced improvement of the major banks, followed by
National Australia Bank's 71.3 cents improvement, ANZ rose 22
cents while Commonwealth finished 44.5 cents stronger.
</P>
<P>
Insurance major AMP relatively underperformed, adding 10.3
cents. Global media group News Corp. benefited from the rate
reduction, with an expectation of a more buoyant U.S. market
improving the prospects for a successful float of its Fox assets.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications group Telstra was the top traded stock,
adding four cents on volume of 14.19 million. Building products
concern James Hardie Industries was steady at 3.15 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index closed 22.3 points higher at 1,029.9,

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Rebound in Tokyo on U.S. Interest Rate Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rebounded in Tokyo
Friday, ending a three-day string of losses thanks to the surprise
decision by U.S. monetary authorities to cut two key interest
rates to cope with a growing domestic credit crunch.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 285.17 points, or 2.19
percent, from Thursday's close to end at 13,280.54.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, advanced 26.57 points or 2.71 percent to
1,006.68.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up to an estimated 468
million shares from Thursday's 408.97 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan was the day's most heavily
traded issue.
</P>
<P>
The 0.25 percentage point cut in both the U.S. discount rate
and the federal funds target rate spurred a big rally overnight on
Wall Street, and the euphoria quickly spilled over into the Tokyo
market.
</P>
<P>
Major exporters to the United States were big winners. The good
news overseas, however, did little to wipe away the strong fears
gripping investors over Japan's economy.
</P>
<P>
With its large trade surplus, Japan clearly will benefit from
any domestic stimulus in the United States, but nonetheless, the
domestic problems in Japan are obviously still fairly large, so
that will keep the market under pressure, an analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,344 issues listed on the First Section, gainers
surpassed losers 710 to 384, with 177 issues ending unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Reaches 5-Month High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar reached
its highest level in five months Friday, climbing over the 64 U.S.
cents barrier during morning trade.
</P>
<P>
The local currency last hit such heights on May 6.
</P>
<P>
However, it relinquished its hold on 64 U.S. cents to finish
the day's trading little changed from Thursday's levels.
</P>
<P>
The market mood was bullish after the surprise cut in U.S.
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Australian debt prices also surged, finishing strongly in front
as the market brought forward its timing for a reduction in local
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts now expect a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of
Australia as a 60 percent chance by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended Friday at 63.56 U.S. cents from
63.61 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It also finished at 74.09 Japanese yen from 75.26 and 1.0279
German marks from 1.0392.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar was sharply weaker against both Japanese and
German currencies, buying 116.48 Japanese yen from 118.29 and
1.6165 German marks from 1.6332 in late local business Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve announced a reduction of 25 basis
points in both its Fed funds and its discount rates, the first
time the Fed adjusted interest rates between Open Market Committee
meetings since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed funds rate is now 5.00 percent, comparable to
official cash rates here.
</P>
<P>
The result of the move was a severe weakening of the U.S.
dollar and sent the Australian unit spiraling up to a high of
64.14 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
But, as the implications for a cut in local rates were mulled,
the market took a step back and sellers late in the day pushed the
unit back to close at its lows.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless the Australian dollar has come a fair way in the
week, gaining two U.S. cents.

TOKYO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan decided Friday to resume
its financial contributions to the construction of two light-water
nuclear reactors for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK), the Kyodo News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi told Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka to take
necessary procedures to implement the decision, the report quoted
government officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Japan suspended its financial contributions to the New
York-based Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO)
immediately after the DPRK fired August 31 a rocket, which Tokyo
maintains was a ballistic missile, over Japan into the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government plans to sign a cost-sharing agreement
with other KEDO board members -- South Korea, the United Sates and
the European Union (EU) -- as early as next week, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the construction was reportedly set at 4.6
billion U.S. dollars, with South Korea expected to shoulder 70
percent and Japan to pay one billion dollars. The United States
and the EU will share the remaining.

<HEADLINE> No Quick Solution to Pak-Indian Bilateral Issues:  Shamshad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmad Friday said that he was not expecting any
"quick-fix solution" to the outstanding issues including Kashmir
between Islamabad and New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
He was talking to reporters before entering into the first
session of peace talks, resuming after a year-long deadlock, with
his Indian counterpart K. Ragunath at a government guest house
here Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going in for any quick-fix solution," Shamshad
said.
</P>
<P>
"The neighboring Pakistan and India need to build a friendly
relationship and the talks are the first step toward that
direction," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India, following their tit-for-tat nuclear
explosions in May this year, also need to develop a regime for
mutual restraint, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not expect results just from one meeting. We are just
initiating the process and we will try to bring the process to a
logical conclusion as soon as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no substitute for talks in seeking durable solutions
to disputes," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, the Indian foreign secretary avoided the reporters
questions.
</P>
<P>
Friday's talks will mainly focus on the issues of regional
peace and security which top the 8-point agenda agreed by the two
sides during their talks last June.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also discuss Saturday the Kashmir dispute
which has bedeviled the relations between Islamabad and New Delhi
for the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
A closed session is set for Saturday after which the delegation
leaders will address a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Another round of talks will be held in New Delhi next month to
discuss other bilateral issues between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Leaders May Meet Separately at APEC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN leaders, including
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie and Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong, may have a separate meeting during the upcoming summit
of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) in Malaysia
next month.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Singapore Ambassador to Indonesia Edward Lee
 Friday following the handover of a humanitarian aid in the form
of rice and medicines to the regional government of Riau in Batam
Municipality near Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"I believe ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
leaders will meet because such a meeting has become a tradition,"
Edward Lee was quoted by Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asked when the Indonesian and Singapore leaders will meet,
Edward Lee said there is a possibility during the APEC meeting.
</P>
<P>
Since his appointment as Indonesia's third president last May,
Habibie has not met with Goh Chok Tong, despite a number of
meetings between Indonesian and Singapore ministers and senior
officials in Jakarta as well as in the island republic.
</P>
<P>
Habibie has only met with his Philippine counterpart Joseph
Estrada in Batam Tuesday during a break of the latter's visit to
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
However, Habibie's attendance at the APEC meeting has not been
decided.
</P>
<P>
"The reason has nothing to do with the situation in Malaysia.
Aside from technical considerations, Indonesia is yet to have a
vice president," Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said during a press
conference following the Habibie-Estrada meeting.
</P>
<P>
Even if Habibie decides to attend the APEC meeting, he may go
in the morning and return to Jakarta that very afternoon, Alatas
added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Leader Urges Netanyahu, Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition Labor
Party leader Ehud Barak has urged both Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to make
compromise at Wye Plantation peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In a signed article published here Friday by local daily
Jerusalem Post, Barak said "you must not be defeated in your
mission by political nay-sayers or the cynical practitioners of
violence... and Your compromise and responsibility will determine
the future of the Israeli and Palestinian people: coexistence or
war."
</P>
<P>
Barak called on Netanyahu and Arafat not to let the so-called
violence to deter their peace talks. "Terrorists can not be
allowed to dictate our policy and now is the time to take
courageous steps and show true leadership" in reaching agreements
concerning the peace process, he added.
</P>
<P>
The deadly targets of terror are non-partisan, he said, adding
that "the only way to achieve personal security for individuals,
and overall security for Israel, is to create a physical
separation from the Palestinians, thereby establishing viable
peace within security lines."
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance for a negotiated solution of
long-standing conflicts, Barak said "a settlement with the
Palestinians is an essential step toward tackling the
far-reaching dangers on our horizon."
</P>
<P>
Barak also urged Netanyahu and Arafat to decide together to
put an end to the atmosphere of hostility and fear, to resume the
mutual trust that characterized the negotiations under the former
Labor government and to usher in an environment of progress and
hopes.
</P>
<P>
Barak stated before the summit that his party will support
Natanyahu in reaching an agreement the Palestinians on Israel's
further troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Israel-Palestinian three-way summit began Thursday at
the White House and later being moved to Wye Plantation in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks Thursday, U.S. President Bill Clinton
called on Netanyahu and Arafat to make the compromises necessary
to "break the logjam" and produce a "meaningful and enduring
agreement" at their summit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai decided
late Thursday night to postpone his trip to the U.S. till
Saturday evening, saying the decision was taken in light of
sensitive security situation in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai had been scheduled to leave Israel to join Netanyahu
for the summit Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's other "kitchen cabinet" ministers including newly
appointed Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon are already at his
side.

</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown has privately
accepted that there is little chance of a referendum on
proportional representation in this parliament after evidence that
Prime Minister Tony Blair has decided to delay electoral reform
for the Commons for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>

beleaguered British farming industry.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, Thursday

<HEADLINE> More Than Half of S.Korean Foreign Reserves are Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korean foreign currency
reserve stood at 43.37 billion U.S. dollars in September this
year, but 66.2 percent, or 28.71 billion are borrowed, the
Ministry of Finance and Economy said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) topped the list of
foreign lenders with 17.99 billion U.S. dollars, followed by the
World Bank with 3.8 billion and the Asian Development Bank with
three billion.
</P>
<P>
The 3.92-billion worth of sovereign bonds issued in April this
year is also part of the foreign exchange reserve.
</P>
<P>
The remainder is from the recollection of the Bank of Korea's
loans to commercial banks, current account surplus and interest
income from the central bank's foreign currency deposits abroad.
</P>
<P>
South Korea will pay some yearly 6-8 percent interest on its
loans from the IMF, World Bank and the Asian Development Bank
while receiving 5-6 percent interest on the BOK's portfolio of
U.S. Treasury Bills and deposits in the Federal Reserve Board in
New York.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, still regarded by some analysts as vulnerable to
another currency crisis as the nation's inducement of foreign
capital has fallen far short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
It is good for the financial crisis-plagued country to increase
its foreign currency reserve through trade surpluses and foreign
direct investments, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
They proposed the government improve the environment for
foreign investment to increase its foreign currency holdings and
to make up for the outflow of capital from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts also pointed out that due to investors' low
confidence in the world market, low-cost loans from international
lending agencies is a second best option.
</P>
<P>
Last December, South Korea signed an agreement with the IMF for
a rescue loan of 58 billion U.S. dollars after it was gripped by a
financial crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of
financial institutions late last year.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Captures Major Rebels Base in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- One of the largest rebel base
in eastern Sierra Leone, Salama, was captured by a combined force
of the West African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) and the Kamajor
militia Friday after a four-day battle, a report reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
The report said 537 civilians who had been held captive were
also rescued and a large cache of arms and ammunition seized.
</P>
<P>
The battle for Salama, 16 miles from the Guinea border,
started Monday when ECOMOG and its Kamajor allies launched an
offensive with bombardment by ECOMOG fighter planes.
</P>
<P>
According to a Kamajor battalion commander John Musa, 65
rebels were killed.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to ECOMOG said the capture of Salama marks a big
set back for the Revolutionary United Front rebels as the base
had been used as a springboard to launch attacks on towns and
villages in Eastern Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
It also cuts the supply route for arms and ammunition from
neighboring countries, the report said.

<HEADLINE> 11,000 Kids Die of Malnutrition Everyday: WFP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A total of 11,000 children die
of malnutrition each day in the world and more are suffering
protein and calories deficiencies, a World Food Program (WFP)
report said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report carried on the Monitor daily,
malnutrition is a significant factor in the deaths of these
children, one child every eight seconds.
</P>
<P>
It said children are particularly affected by disasters and it
is they who endured them most. An estimated 192 million children
below the age of five suffer from protein and calories
deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
Widespread hunger exists despite the fact that there is enough
food in the world to adequately feed every man, woman and child
alive today.
</P>
<P>
Hunger afflicts one out of every seven people on earth, it
added. More than 800 million people are malnourished and
starvation threatens another 50 million victims of man-made and
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The WFP began its mission in January 1963. Today the
Rome-based food agency, the largest international food aid agency
in the world, has a staff of more than 4,000 in 76 countries.
</P>
<P>
Its expenditures amounted to 1.2 billion U.S. Dollars for
food, transport and administration. Some 2.9 million tons of food
is delivered to 199 relief operations and 163 development
activities.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Finance Budget Deficit with Forex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
decided to withdraw 1.87 billion U.S. Dollars from its foreign
exchange reserve to finance the substantial deficit expected in
the 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC)
which ended Thursday in Nigerian capital Abuja, Information and
Cultural Minister John Nwodo said there was a shortfall in
projected revenue to the tune of 34 percent, press reports said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the shortfall arose mainly from the
decrease in oil revenue, adding that the 1998 budget was
predicted on 17 Dollars per barrel but currently on 13 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
As Nigeria exports more than two million barrels of crude oil
per day, the oil price fall would cause the country a shortfall
of 1.7 billion Dollars from the total projected revenue.
</P>
<P>
Nwodo said the FEC meeting also decided to give priority to
Turn-Around Maintenance of oil refineries in the country to
ensure that all four refineries are quickly returned to normalcy.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, projected capital expenditure for
the remaining part of the year have been pruned to the tune of
250 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We have targeted projects that have not taken off at the
scheduled time and whose cash demands in the balance of the year
would never meet the projected budgetary provision," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nwodo also said the Nigerian government decried the incessant
disruption of activities of oil firms in the Niger Delta area,
adding that it can no longer afford to stand by the nation's
security and economy compromised in any way.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, serious disruptions of oil production
in the Niger Delta have led, in some cases, to disruption of oil
export by a number of multi-national companies involved in oil
activities in the area.
</P>
<P>
"Chevron is losing 105,000 barrels of crude oil per day, Shell
is losing half a million barrels per day, Cornoco and Agip are
losing substantial barrels whose statistics I do not have
presently," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister warned that any further disruption of oil
activities would be met with serious consequences of the law.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Food Assistance Indispensable to Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The assistance provided to
Uganda by the World Food Program (WFP) is indispensable to
food-sufficiency of Uganda and to the country's development in
other areas.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the Rome-based WFP said Friday that its
assistance in Uganda has focused on the development of human
resources, support to education, health, rural development and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Since it was operational in Uganda 25 years ago, WFP has
completed 62 development projects and relief operations in this
east African country at a total cost of 262 million U.S. Dollars,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Of this assistance, development accounted for 36 percent while
the rest goes to refugees, drought affected and displaced people.
</P>
<P>
The press release indicated that on-going assistance totals
64.8 million Dollars, including development (nine percent),
refugee assistance (49 percent), and support to displaced people
(42 percent).
</P>
<P>
In addition to the above-mentioned projects, WFP implements
various special operations including bridge repair, warehousing,
hiring of local transport and local food procurement, which
provide indirect support of over 31 million Dollars to the
country.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the U.N. organization has purchased an average
55,000 tons of maize, beans, sorghum and blended foods annually.
This had a positive macro-economic effect in promoting
agricultural export products and increasing foreign exchange
earnings.
</P>
<P>
Although Uganda is considered a food-sufficient country, it is
still one of the poorest countries in sub-Sahara Africa and half
of its population lives in areas where average food availability
is less than the daily requirement.
</P>
<P>
It is for this reason that the WFP had to intervene on a
number of occasions to save lives and help restore nutritional
levels, said the release.

<HEADLINE> China Looking For Fourth Quarter Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Ye Zhen, a State Statistics
Bureau spokesman, told a press conference this afternoon that
China can expect marked acceleration in economic growth in the
last three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
It has bottomed out in the past few months and the third
quarter GDP is growing 7.6 percent, despite the serious flooding
in the summer.
</P>
<P>
He said that the GDP for the first nine months was 5.4 trillion
yuan, up 7.2 percent from the same period last year, with primary
industry up 2.5 percent, secondary industry, 8.3 percent, and
tertiary industry, 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ye said that indicators show a fourth quarter contribution that
is greater than a quarter of the annual GDP and that the hundreds
of billions of yuan of government investment in fixed assets will
give a powerful push to economic growth in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a good autumn harvest of the agricultural sector
and a surging construction industry will pull the GDP growth rate
higher in the last three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Steel, cement and plate glass picked up speed in growth in the
past three months. These indicators usually rise two or three
months before accelerated economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Diet Enacts Bank Recapitalization Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Diet (parliament) on
Friday enacted a bank recapitalization bill to allow the
government to inject funds into banks through purchases of their
newly issued preferred and common shares.
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation, any bank seeking public money is
required to submit an application to an independent panel
authorized to approve or reject the request. The panel will also
set conditions for the bank to receive public funds.
</P>
<P>
The enactment of the bank recapitalization bill ended months of
political wrangling between the LDP and opposition parties over
how to fix the country's ailing banking system.
</P>
<P>
The move was backed by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) and three opposition groups. The main opposition Democratic
Party of Japan (DPJ) voted against the bill.
</P>
<P>
The upper house also voted for a second fiscal 1998
supplementary budget permitting the government to guarantee up to
43 trillion yen (about 370.6 billion dollars) that may be borrowed
by the public Deposit Insurance Corp. from the Bank of Japan to
help capital-short banks and to deal with failed banks.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation follows Monday's enactment of eight banking
reform bills, which stipulate ways to deal with failed banks and
pave the way for the government to temporarily put the troubled

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stock Market Gains Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus Stock Market ended
the week in positive territory, achieving weekly gains for the
first time in the past three weeks, a market review said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The review, issued by Cyprus Investment and Securities
Corporation Limited (CISCO), said the CISCO All-Share Index
closed Thursday at 426.8 points, improved by 2.2 points or 0.5
percent for the week.
</P>
<P>
Investment activity remained at satisfactory levels with the
daily average close to 1 million Cyprus pounds (about 2 million
U.S. dollars), the review added.
</P>
<P>
It said that following the announcement by Bank of Cyprus
(BOC) that it has officially applied for a listing on the
Athens Stock Exchange on October 8, the market reversed its
downtrend during the next two trading sessions due to the
advance in BOC's share price.
</P>
<P>
Since then the market retreated slightly, due to selling
pressures exerted mainly on the banking sector, the review added.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of transactions for this week was 4.8 million
Cyprus pounds (about 9.6 million dollars), compared to 5.6 million
pounds (about 11.2 million dollars) the week before.

<HEADLINE> Excavation Of Underground Palace to Be Broadcast Live </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Archeologists will open the
door of a newly-discovered underground palace at 12:00 tomorrow
and the whole process will be broadcast live at the same time by
China Central Television (CCTV) for the whole world to see,
sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
The palace was discovered beneath the 1,400-year-old Fa Wang
Tower in the southern part of Zhouzhi County in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
After locating the door of the palace on October 7,
archeologists and technicians worked hard to remove a lot of
rubble blocking it. The brick gateway opened onto the palace.
</P>
<P>
Four flights of steps were also exposed, going up. Then, behind
an arch, there was another piece of a gate.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have cleared 2.15 meter of the gateway behind the
arch that is about a meter towards the center of the tower
base. The outline of the palace door was just barely visible.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Debt Servicing to Double by 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is expected to disburse
about 610 million U.S. Dollars in debt servicing in the year
2002, which nearly doubles the current levels.
</P>
<P>
Peter Malambo, an economist at the Ministry of Finance
responsible for external resources, disclosed this at a press
seminar in Lusaka Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Friday quoted Malambo as saying that the
increased disbursement will be as a result of the expiry of the
grace period granted by the debtors.
</P>
<P>
The grace period of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF)/Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) for paying
back some of the debts clinched by Zambia in 1995 will expire by
the year 2001, which means Zambia has to suffer increased
disbursements in addition to other debt obligations which will
fall due by that period, said Malambo.
</P>
<P>
The disbursement will represent a marked jump in the levels of
servicing ranging from 290 million to 396 million Dollars between
this year and the year 2000, according to the economist.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is expected to service about 290 million Dollars this
year toward the country's debt stock, now estimated at 6.4
billion Dollars, but the figure will gradually increase to 350
million Dollars next year and to 392 million Dollars in the year
2000, said Malambo.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that the country has witnessed a shift from
owing the bulk of its debt to bilateral creditors to multilateral
donors.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Apparel, Textile Exposition '98 Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The three-day annual Bangladesh
Apparel and Textile Exposition (BATEXPO '98) opened here Friday to
promote the export of the country's apparel and textile products.
</P>
<P>
This specialized trade fair will definitely have a far-reaching
positive impact on the development and promotion of the country's
exports, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said at the opening
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
BATEXO '98 is the biggest exposition in the country's apparel
and textile sector since 1986 when such kind of trade was first
held.
</P>
<P>
A total of 79 firms from at home and abroad are participating
in the fair, and a good number of investors from East and Far
Eastern countries and representatives of some internationally
reputed chains of departments stores are also among the
participants.
</P>
<P>
The exposition will act as a bridge between the Bangladeshi
manufacturers and the overseas buyers, she said. "I'm sure our
manufacturers will have a chance to acquire knowledge about the
latest technical know-how which will facilitate them to improve
the quality of their products."
</P>
<P>
Present on the occasion were about 2,000 people including
ministers of finance, commerce and industries, labor and
employment, as well as representatives of related local and
foreign big corporations.
</P>
<P>
During the 3-day exposition, three seminars will be organized
to exchange views, thoughts and ideas on issues related to mutual
benefits to be shared with overseas partners in the international
textile and clothing trade.
</P>
<P>
BATEXPO '97 helped generate business worth 35.52 million U.S.
dollars from the spot orders as against 32 million dollars in
1996, and this year's BATEXPO is expected to help generate
business worth about 70 million dollars, according to Mostafa
Golam Quddus, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers
and Exporters Association, the organizer of the trade fair.
</P>
<P>
Starting in the late 1970s as a small non-traditional sector of
export, ready-made garment (RMG) sector emerged as a promising
export earning sector of the country in 1983.
</P>
<P>
The RMG sector has been growing rapidly, particularly in recent
years, with an annual growth rate of over 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are more than 2,700 garment manufacturers and
exporters in the country, with both direct and indirect employment
of nearly 1.5 million and 15 million workers respectively, of whom
90 percent are women.
</P>
<P>
The garment and apparel sector contributes as much as 73.28
percent to the country's total foreign exchange earnings, playing
a catalytic role behind generation of consequential economic
activities in the country. Bangladesh exported 3.43 billion
dollars' worth of apparel in 1997, and the export is expected to
cross 4 billion dollars this year.

today, said that China places great importance on relations with
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and supports ASEAN in
playing a positive role in international and regional affairs.
</P>
<P>

<P>
Jayakumar said that Singaporean-Chinese ties have been good,
and that there are no issues demanding a prompt solution and that
frequent exchanges of visits by the two countries' leaders have
played an important role in the smooth growth of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have close economic and trade ties and should
increase cooperation.
</P>
<P>

regional economy, development prospects in the long run are good
and that China is willing to increase economic and trade

<HEADLINE> Insect-Resistant Cotton Strain Gets Good Results in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Hebei province
reported a good cotton harvest by using insect-resistant cotton
strains imported from the United States on large tracts this year.
</P>
<P>
The province, a leading cotton grower in northern China, used
the strain on 80,000 ha of land this year. A local agronomist says
that per ha yield was 1,050 kg on average, 30 percent higher than
common strains, and profit per ha of land increased by 4,500 yuan
because of the decreased need for chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Li Ping, a local cotton grower, says that he used to regard
cotton growing as not being very profitable because he spent as
much as 4,500 yuan per ha of land only to yield 600 kg. But, he is
satisfied with the results of the insect-resistant cotton this
year, as the amount of farm chemicals applied was cut by half and
per unit output was doubled.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Inflation Rises Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's consumer
inflation rose sharply again in September as sharp hikes in
mortgage rates continued to take their toll, national media
Friday quoted Statistics South Africa figures as showing.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index growth was 9.1 percent year on year
and 1.7 percent month on month in September.
</P>
<P>
The data was well above market expectations of a 1.2 percent
month-on-month and 8.4 percent year-on-year rise.
</P>
<P>
The sharp leap of inflation rates in September was the third
straight increase in as many months. Inflation hovered between
5.0 and 5.6 percent in the first six months of 1998. It rose to
6.6 percent in July and 7.6 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
However, the market shrugged off the worse than expected
figures, as it was severely distorted by interest rates, and
preferred to focus on core inflation, which edged up to 7.7
percent last month from 7.6 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
Core inflation, which excludes mortgage rates, volatile food
items and value added tax, is the Reserve Bank's preferred
indicator of underlying inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe while headline inflation may well shoot up
to two digits, the core inflation will remain comfortably below
10 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Xie Zhenghau, director of State
Environmental Protection Administration, said here today
environmental protection is one of China's basic policies.
</P>
<P>

protecting the country's tourism resources for sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
Xie said that China has enacted six environment protection laws
and nine natural resources protection laws and has promulgated 28
administrative rules and regulations for tourism destinations,
along with 375 environmental standards to provide a preliminary
legal system that protects the tourist environment.

<HEADLINE> New System Used in 1999 Volleyball World League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A new scoring system will be
adopted for the 1999 Volleyball World League to boost spectators'
interest, it was revealed here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The World League Council approved a proposal to use the Rally
Point system, with 25 points for the first four sets and with 15
points for the decider, at a meeting here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ruben Acosta, president of volleyball's world governing body
FIVB, told the Council many countries welcome the rally points
system which was easy to understand and respect the spirit of
volleyball.
</P>
<P>
The new system was more attractive to spectators as it packed
more excitement in a shorter period. It reduced the time
difference between the shortest and longest matches, with games
rarely exceeding two hours, making it easier for TV packaging.
</P>
<P>
The 12-nation World League next year will have some new faces,
with Australia making its debut and France and Canada returning
to the fold after several years'absence.
</P>
<P>
The preliminaries will take place over six weekends between
May 28 and July 4, with the six-nation finals scheduled to be
held in Argentina July 12-17.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Rebels Split Over Civilian Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Lord's Resistance Army
(LRA), which has been fighting the Ugandan government from bases
in Sudan for more than 12 years, has reportedly split into two
over the issue of how to treat civilians in northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The break-away group, the Lord's Resistance Army-Democratic
(LRA-D), is led by Ronald Otim Komakech, a long-time war planner
for the LRA warlord Joseph Kony, New Vision paper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Komakech has opened an office in Juba in southern Sudan under
the protection of Ali Bamuze's Uganda National Rescue Front Part
Two (UNRF-II). Despite mediation efforts by the Sudanese
military, Kony and Bamuse remain violently opposed to each other.
</P>
<P>
The report said this split has caused tension among Ugandan
dissidents in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Army Spokesman Shaban Bantariza attributed the split to the
share of cash given by Sudan or the humanitarian catastrophe they
have created in northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
This is a sign of their approaching their end, the spokesman
noted.
</P>
<P>
Komakech is believed to hail from near the Gulu-Adjumani
district border. He was a soldier based in Bondo barracks in
Arua in early 1980s in the defunct Uganda National Liberation
Army.
</P>
<P>
He attracted many junior rebel officers who disagree with
Kony's ruthless treatment of civilians.
</P>
<P>
The LRA rebels have killed, maimed hundreds of abducted
civilians and defiled children.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are from different clans in northern Uganda. Rebels
belonging to one clan often retaliate if members of their clan
are targeted by rebels of another clan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese military in Juba is equally divided over this
split among the LRA rebels. Khartoum is said to be exerting
pressure on Komakech and Kony to reconcile and fight against
Uganda's government army.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Holds First Carpet Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Nepal opened here Friday a
three-day carpet fair, the first of its kind in the country, in
order to boost the export of carpets, its number one export
product.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala inaugurated the
fair, named Nepal Carpet Mart 1998, pledging that the government
is committed to assisting the private sector in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He said that market has to be diversified so as to boost the
export.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government has taken stringent measures to
stop the use of child labor in the carpet industry.
</P>
<P>
Dibya Mani Rajbhandari, chairman of the Organizing Committee,
noted on the occasion that carpet industry is the biggest sector
in terms of employment, turnover and foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 300,000 people are directly and
indirectly employed by the industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1993/94, carpet export was as high as 3.3 million square
meters. But since then, the export has declined slowly to 2.8
million square meters, said Binod Shrestha from the Organizing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said that Nepal still ranks third after Iran and India in
the world in terms of carpet export.
</P>
<P>
Rajbhandari blamed the declining export for such factors as
overproduction, decline in quality, imitation of design, unfair
competition among producers, exaggeration of alleged child labor
use and environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
He said that in order to revitalize the industry, Nepal is
trying to strengthen the existing market in Germany, where more
than 80 percent of Nepal's total carpet export goes, and explore
markets in other European countries, the United States, Canada,
Japan and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Live demonstration of carpet weaving, buyers-sellers meetings,
cultural programs and business symposia are also scheduled for the
occasion.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets Philippine House Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
National People's Congress Standing Committee, met here today with
Manuel Villar, speaker of the Philippine House of Representative.
</P>
<P>
Li welcomed Villar to the 6th General Assembly of the
Asia-Pacific Parliamentarians Conference on Environment and
Development here.
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippine parliament, which has sent a large and
high-level delegation to the conference, is demonstrating that it
values relations with China and the cause of environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
Developed and developing countries have similar though
different concerns on environmental issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries need resources for their economic
progress, which can cause conflict between exploitation and
environmental protection. By the same token, developed countries
give more importance to environmental protection for better living
quality, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that China attaches great importance to
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
China has done much work on environmental protection
legislation and a corresponding legal system which has now
basically been formed, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, China also has problems in this regard. All levels of
Chinese government and people's congresses have added
environmental and ecological protection concerns to their agendas.
</P>
<P>
Villar said the Philippine government and parliament attach
great importance to relations with China.
</P>
<P>
The delegation came to Guilin with the intention of discussing
with other participants ways of protecting the environment while
at the same time enhancing tourism, and to further the
Philippine-China relationship, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Philippines is determined to enhance
environmental protection despite its financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Guilin is a model for environmental protection, he said,
adding that the Philippine delegation has gained beneficial
experience through this visit.

<HEADLINE> Business Confidence Plunges to Two-year Low in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Business confidence has
plunged to a two-year low in India with a majority of the industry
predicting either a worsening of the situation or continuation of
the current subdued business scenario, the Confederation of Indian
Industry (CII) said in its latest survey.
</P>
<P>
What is worse is that 52 percent of the 524 CII members
surveyed foresee lower profits during the second half ending March
1999 while 34 percent expect the current trends to continue, CII
said in the 50th business outlook survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which covers various industrial sectors, reveals
that barely 16 percent of the companies surveyed are optimistic
about the general business prospects in the second half of the
financial year 1998-99 while as many as 47 percent are
pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
Indian industrial production continued to decline in August
with a growth rate of only 2.4 percent compared with 5.2 percent
the same month last year and cumulative industrial growth so far
this year (April to August) also dipped sharply to 3.5 percent
from 5.5 percent in the previous year, according to the latest
figures for index of industrial production (IIP).
</P>
<P>
The IIP released Tuesday by the Central Statistical
Organization showed that the cumulative growth in industrial
production has been declined consistently during the current
financial year from 5.4 percent in April-June to 4 percent in
April-July and the present level of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The CII survey said that major constraints in expanding output
in the next six months were identified as lack of order from
government and domestic customers, infrastructure bottlenecks,
anomalies in duty structure, political instability, international
and domestic competition and capacity constraints.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that as many as 55 percent expect their
capital investment to decline in the next six months, indicating a
suspension of expansion, modernization and diversification
activities for most companies, while 24 percent see a capital
investment of more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
As for industrial production, 25 percent projected a negative
growth in their organization's production rate in the current
fiscal year, 38 percent forecast a production growth of 0-5
percent and only 17 percent hope to grow by more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), an independent
forecaster, said Monday that growth rate of the Indian economy
would drop to 4.5 percent in 1998-99 from an earlier projection of
5 percent due to a decline in agricultural production and a
substantial slowdown in the industrial and service sectors.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures released earlier by the CII showed that the
majority of Indian industries had less than 10 percent or negative
growth rate in the first half of the current fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Slovenian Official Hails Sino-Slovenian Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Slovenia and China have made
big headway in their friendly and cooperative relations though the
two countries forged diplomatic relations not long before,
said Ernest Petric, state secretary of the Slovenian
Foreign Ministry, in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
China decided to establish diplomatic relations with Slovenia
soon after the nation won independence in 1992. Since then, a
number of agreements have been signed by the two countries to
boost bilateral cooperation in the fields of science, technology,
economy, trade and culture.
</P>
<P>
Petric, who is now in China for diplomatic consultation with
the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told Xinhua that his current China
tour has further promoted the mutual understanding and trust
between the two countries. Consultations of this kind will
continue, he added.
</P>
<P>
On his impression about China, Petric, who is visiting
China for the first time, said the country's development is even
"faster" than he had expected.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly China is not a paradise, but it is full of vitality
and hope," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Petric, who has served as ambassador to India, Nepal and
the United States, said that China is one of the most important
nations in the world and the development of China will greatly
help "reshape the world in the next century."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Slovenia's relations with the European Union,
Petric told Xinhua that Slovenia hopes to join the EU at an early
date because of its considerations of culture, economy, security
and geographic location.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Convinces Mugabe Over Congo (K): Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has convinced
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe that the armed conflict in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is due to internal political
opposition to the "one-man rule" of President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
This was achieved through numerous summits between Uganda and
Zimbabwe, Amama Mbabazi, state minister for regional cooperation,
was quoted by Friday's New Vision daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said Thursday both sides agreed that Kabila is a one-man
rule opposed by many internal political forces and needs a
negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said the state minister flew to Harare, Zimbabwe
for close-door talks with Mugabe recently.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has been accused of backing Tutsi rebels fighting
Kabila, a charge Kampala quickly denied.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean forces were invited to fight for Kabila in
mid-August, some two weeks after the eruption of the rebellion in
the vast central African country. Now Zimbabwe has more than
3,000 troops in DRC.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan forces occupy positions crucial to our defense in
eastern Congo (K) mainly because of the anticipated aggression
from Sudan, he added.

<HEADLINE> Active Undersea Volcanoes Discovered in South Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Three new active undersea
volcanoes, rocks that ooze mercury, and previously unidentified
sealife have been discovered by scientists on a joint New Zealand
and German scientific expedition along the South Pacific "Ring of
Fire" between Tonga and New Zealand, The Evening Post reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper said that during the expedition,
which finished here Thursday, scientists spent five weeks
exploring a series of undersea volcanoes about 620 kilometers
northeast of Whakatane in the Kermadec Trench and volcanic vents
around White Island.
</P>
<P>
It quoted joint chief scientist Dr. Ian Wright as saying three
active undersea volcanoes were discovered, and he expected there
were still more to find.
</P>
<P>
Just what dangers the undersea volcanoes could pose for New
Zealand is still being researched and the expedition's data could
take years to analyze, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A two-man submersible was used to study the volcanic vents,
along active fault lines, and take samples at depths of up to 200
meters.
</P>
<P>
The scientists also discovered a host of previously
unidentified sealife, including crabs, coral, anemones and
bacteria, and rocks that ooze mercury. It is "thought to be the
first discovery of its kind in the world", the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The submersible, Jago, is now on its way to explore volcanic
vents in Lake Taupo in the center of New Zealand's North Island.
This is another joint New Zealand and German scientific project.
</P>
<P>
The Jago submersible is scheduled to spend four days searching
a reef at depths of around 160 meters, taking photographs, water,
rock and gas samples. The area is believed to be the remnant of
the enormous volcano which formed the lake 2,000 years ago, the
paper said.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Reiterates Support to China's Poverty Reduction Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) has reiterated it will continue to support China's
efforts to reduce poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a press release on launching its 1998 Poverty Report faxed
here today, UNDP said that its support to China's poverty
reduction program has been concentrated on promoting innovative
and participatory approaches in some of the country's poorest
counties.
</P>
<P>
It places emphasis on microfinance schemes, environmentally
sustainable practices and the participation of women which have
been carrying out in China, the UNDP said.
</P>
<P>
China's national poverty reduction program targets at
alleviating poverty for 80 million people in seven years until the
end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, UNDP has provided aid in grants over
21 million U.S. dollars to support 16 poverty alleviation related
projects which target and reach the poor households in 48
poverty-striken counties across China.
</P>
<P>
While calling on all UN member countries to join in the task of
improving the lives of millions of people all over the world, the
UNDP release admitted that the outlook of poverty eradication is
grimmer today than it was a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis enveloping much of East Asia has shown an
unexpected resilience and is affecting millions of households in a
severe way," it says.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the financial liberalization strategy carried out
in some East Asian countries has been attributable to the
financial turmoil, UNDP said China has been able to keep its
economy growing despite a more prudent approach to financial
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
UNDP points out that poverty reduction should be the focus of
nations' whole development strategies -- of public expenditures,
investment in capital and technology,a nd of macroeconomic
policies.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Opposes Holding Summit Outside Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen said Friday he is opposed to holding the three
party summit outside Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, also vice-president of the Cambodian People's Party
(CPP), made the remarks after a regular cabinet meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the meeting it is, it should be held in our own
country, if it is about Cambodia," Hun Sen stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We are against internationalizing the Cambodia issue. Any
attempt to hold the summit outside the country is to split
Cambodia. It is meant to let one side control the border area and
the other dominate Phnom Penh. It's absolutely unacceptable," Hun
Sen added.
</P>
<P>
It was the toughest response strongman Hun Sen made so far to
opposition FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) which proposed
 calling the summit in Beijing or elsewhere outside Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to his father King Norodom Sihanouk Wednesday,
Prince Ranariddh asked the monarch to convene a summit in the
king's residence in Beijing, saying he feared for his safety in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"The FUNCINPEC request does not mean that FUNCINPEC does not
respect the independence and sovereignty of Cambodia," a FUNCINPEC
statement said. "On the contrary, we just want to find one neutral
place for the purpose of resolving this serious crisis."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen pointed out it is only a pretext of the opposition.
"You can see what has happened in Phnom Penh now, they have the
full rights. If there were intimidations as they stated, then how
can they leave and return to the country freely," he said.
</P>
<P>
The hoped-for summit, which would be the second called by King
Sihanouk since the July 26 election, is aimed at breaking the
current deadlock and coming to an agreement to form a government
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The CPP won a slim majority in the National Assembly on July
26, but lacks the two-third majority needed to form a new
government. FUNCINPEC has refused to join a new coalition unless
the CPP makes major concessions.

<P>
COLOMBO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has announced that her government has given top
priority to food security and nutrition in its program for
development.
</P>
<P>
In a message to mark World Food Day falling on Friday, the
president said that in comparison to other countries in the
region, Sri Lanka had a very rich and fertile soil and several
crops with bountiful harvests throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
The country's weather patterns, irrigation networks and
scientific agricultural policy and planning, have helped reap
maximum benefits from these natural resources, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In her message, She also said Sri Lanka had also enjoyed
satisfactory health statistics for the past few decades.
</P>
<P>
Infant mortality rates of 16 per thousand live births and low
birth weight of 24 percent are in keeping with the statistics of
developed nations and are indicative of satisfactory community
health care.
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, Sri Lanka had a high incidence of infant and
pre-school malnutrition mainly due to improper and inadequate
feeding practices and the lack of availability of low cost, high
protein complimentary food.
</P>
<P>
She added that the government was in the process of making
preparations to provide comprehensive nutrition education and
nutrition supplementation to infants, pre-school and primary
school children.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A jury ruled in favor of
Michael Jordan on Thursday in a breach-of-contract lawsuit and
awarded Jordan 50,000 U.S. dollars in compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
The Chicago's Cook County jury, also ruling on a counterclaim
Jordan filed, found the producers of "Heaven is a
Playground,"falsely informed the Bulls superstar that they had
obtained sufficient financing for the 1991 basketball movie.
</P>
<P>
The producers accused Jordan of breaking a deal to star in the
movie that ended up flopping without Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated about seven hours today to close the
lawsuit which lasted 35 days.
</P>
<P>
"I feel vindicated," Jordan said, surrounded by a crush or
reporters in the hallway outside the courtroom. "I felt like
someone was trying to attck my integrity."
</P>
<P>
Jurors said their decision hinged on the requirement that the
film producers have 3 million U.S. dollars in financing by a
certain date. The plaintiffs contended they had the money lined
up, if not actually in the bank.
</P>
<P>
Filmmakers Randy Fried and Keith Bank alleged that Jordan,
swayed by agent David Falk, was holding out for a better
opportunity than the 350,000 dollars he was to have received.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- World figure skating
champion Michelle Kwan of the United States was denied entry into
Skate America by the International Skating Union on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kwan, also U.S. three-time champion, did not originally apply
to compete at the event in Detroit from October 29 to November 1.
But she changed her mind only to be told by ISU through the U.S.
Figure Skating Association there was no place for her in the
field.
</P>
<P>
Kwan already has appeared in some ISU open competitions. The
USFSA has been pressured by the ISU, which sanctions events for
Olympic-eligble skaters, to adhere to existing rules for
participation in the Grand Prix series, which do not allow for
Kwan to cross over from one series to the other.
</P>
<P>
Skate America is the first event in the Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
"The USFSA exhausted all efforts with the ISU in an attempt to
clear the way for Michelle's participation in Skate America,"
said USFSA president James Disbrow. "The USFSA is disappointed
that the rules of the ISU have operated to prevent the reigning
world champion and one of the most popular skaters in the world
from competing in the USFSA's premier international event.
</P>
<P>
"As disappointing as this decision is to Michelle, the USFSA
and skating fans across the country, we believe we had no choice
in this matter. "
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed that I won't be allowed to compete in
Skate America," Kwan said. "It is one of my favorite events and I
was really looking forward to being there. But life goes on and
I'm still working hard and preparing for a full year of skating
competitions.

<HEADLINE> Over 10 Children Reported Missing Daily in Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 15 (Xinhua) - About 10 to 15 children, between
the ages of 1-18, are declared missing every day in Bulgaria,
according to the Bulgarian National Police Force.
</P>
<P>
Some of those children are reportedly running away from home
and others are escaping from reform schools or remand centers,
police said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation changes often," said senior police officer Major
Prodanov, "just as we find one, others are declared missing".
</P>
<P>
By October 1, police were searching for 149 minors. Of that
number 36 had disappeared for unknown reasons. The runaways from
home and reform establishments number 74 and 23,
respectively. About 11 had escaped from remand centers, where they
were typically being held for theft.
</P>
<P>
The problems created by young children who run away from home
are more difficult to solve because they can more easily fall
victim to crimes and accidents.
</P>
<P>
In 70 percent of the cases, children between the ages of 14-18,
especially girls, leave home voluntarily. Many wind up on the
streets as prostitutes. Others run away because they are abused by
their parents. These children often refuse to return to their
homes after they are found, Prodanov said.
</P>
<P>
In very few cases are the children found, Prodanov
said. Recently two missing children were found dead in Veliko
Turnovo in north Bulgaria, which upset parents nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The police have reportedly found about 86 of the missing
children, Of those, 44 were declared missing only this year, said
Major Prodanov. enditem

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Taka Devalued Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Bank, the
country's central bank, has devalued the taka by 2.97 percent
against the U.S. dollars. The devaluation will become effective on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the buying and selling rates between the
Bangladesh Bank and the authorized banks would now be 48.356 taka
and 48.65 taka respectively, and the new buying-selling middle
rate would rise to 48.50 taka from the previous 47.10 taka, a bank
announcement issued Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second devaluation of the taka since the current
1998-99 fiscal year began on July 1, and the 14th since the ruling
Awami League came to power in June, 1996, raising the price of a
dollar by 6.75 taka from 41.75 taka to 48.50 taka.
</P>
<P>
The taka was devalued by 1.7 percent against the dollar on July
5 this year.
</P>
<P>
The taka continued to remain "one of the most stable currencies
in the region" and the adjustment was necessary to "spur growth of
exports while retaining its competitive edge," the announcement
said.
</P>
<P>
The adjustment was intended to preserve the competitiveness and
continuing growth of exports "in the face of recent domestic and
external influences on the external sector position of
Bangladesh," it said, referring to the over-two-month-long flood
inundating two-thirds of the county from July to September and the
financial crisis originating last year in Southeast Asia and
having swept all over the world.
</P>
<P>
"The flexible exchange rate policy of continuing
adjustments...has enabled Bangladesh to maintain reasonable growth
and stability in the neighboring region," it added.
</P>
<P>
Hossain Zilllur Rahman, an economist at Bangladesh Institute of
Development Studies, said that it would make imports expensive
while easing the exports to some extent.
</P>
<P>
"But it was not clear why the government went for the
devaluation, as there had been no compelling grounds or reasons
for such massive adjustment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yussuf Abdullah Harun, the outgoing president of the Bangladesh
Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industries, defended the
move. "It was inevitable. The taka was overpriced vis-a-vis our
neighboring currencies. The adjustment would make the exports
competitive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Harun, however, cautioned against a possible inflation
following the devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's overall exports in the first two
months of the current 1998-99 fiscal year experienced an upward
trend against the corresponding period of the past financial year,
the official BSS news agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The total exports during the July-August period was 944.28
million dollars, a rise of 2.43 percent from the corresponding
1997-98 period.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Government Opens Talks With Rebel Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Andres Pastrana announced Wednesday that the government will open
formal peace talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC).
</P>
<P>
In an unexpected message to his people, Pastrana said "I have
taken the decision to order the demilitarization of the
municipalities of Uribe, Mesetas, Macarena, and Vista Hermosa (in
eastern) Meta province and of San Vicente (in southern) Caqueta
province."
</P>
<P>
"This measure will make way for talks between the government
and the FARC which could open the way to a consolidated and
lasting peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
The FARC, the country's largest rebel force, welcomed the move
as a "positive step" in the search for a peaceful solution to the
country's decades-long armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana also announced his recognition of the FARC as a
belligerent force, giving the rebel group a political status which
enables them to negotiate peace in a territory free of regular
troops.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,000 soldiers will withdraw from a territory of more than
42,000 square kilometers by Nov. 7. And the demilitarization is
due to remain in force for 90 days until Feb. 7, 1999.

MONTEVIDEO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The general secretariat of
the Latin American Integration Association signed agreements here
Thursday with Argentine and Brazilian companies to facilitate the
flow of commercial information.
</P>
<P>
The agreements aim at improving information distribution
process of companies about their foreign trade contained in

They will allow the association to surmount logistical
limitations for channeling information on tariffs, tariff
preferences and foreign trade of the member countries provided by
their respective competent official organizations, and to increase
the number of users in the important markets of Argentina and
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
In this way, the customers of Brazilian and Argentine companies
can consult the commercial and tariff information of the
association member countries, as well as about the agreements and
the criteria established under the 1980 Montevideo Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Association sources said that the organization is analysing the
possibility to sign similar agreements with Chilean, Colombian and

<HEADLINE> S.Korea to Eliminate Corruption Among Civil Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Republic of
Korea announced rules Thursday requiring civil servants to declare
gifts valued above a certain standard.
</P>
<P>
Those who don't declare the gifts will be punished, the
government ruled. The rule is intended to put an end to
malfeasance and corruption among middle- and lower-grade civil
servants.
</P>
<P>
The value of a gift that civil servants must declare will be
determined later, an official said. A gift valued above the
standard to be set and is not declared will be considered a bribe.
</P>
<P>
The living standard for most people has dropped since the
financial crisis hit the country. As a result, more and more
protests are being raised by people against increasing graft among
civil servants.
</P>
<P>
The government vowed recently to eliminate graft among
government employees while investigating and punishing corruption
among senior officials as well.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, middle and lower grade civil servants in positions
of power will be transferred, in turn, to other posts to avoid
graft.
</P>
<P>
Civil servants fired for graft will be severely limited in
their search for future employment.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Collapse Amid Continuing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The downward spiral in
Australian wool prices accelerated this week with prices plunging
more than five percent, a drop of more than 20 percent in about
three months.
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Market Indicator (EMI) collapsed 27 cents during
auctions at Australia's three cities of Goulburn, Melbourne and
Fremantle this week to 470 Australian cents a kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The indicator, wool's equivalent of the stock exchange's share
price index, dropped more than 20 percent since July 3, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Despite the low price, 17.4 percent of the 63,507 bales offered
for sale were passed in, adding to the already massive wool
stockpile.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Council of Wool Exporters said there appeared to
be little prospect of any immediate recovery in prices because of
turmoil in the industry and a lack of confidence in wool prices.
</P>
<P>
"Prices continue to indicate the outcome of supply and demand
factors in the market place with customers uncertain whether wool
will be cheaper again next week," the council said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Until a sufficient proportion of the trade determines that the
market has bottomed out, this sentiment will continue to exist.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the drop of wool prices to the reduced Asian
demand, particularly important Japanese buyers. Asia was the
destination for 42 percent of Australia's wool exports in the
fiscal year of 1996-1997, but sales to key Asian markets such as
China, Japan and South Korea all fell the last financial year.
China buys about 25 percent of the wool Australia exports
annually.
</P>
<P>
"The sharp appreciation of the Australian dollar against the
U.S. dollar in recent times has also not assisted."
</P>
<P>
The Council said Thursday's surprise announcement by the
Australian federal government that it wanted to privatize the
million bale wool stockpile under the control of a
government-controlled company also had thrown wool sales into
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"To say that these are turbulent times for the wool industry
would indeed be an understatement," the council said.
</P>
<P>
Sales continue in Sydney and Melbourne next week with another
64,700 bales to be offered for sale.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Government Grants Amnesty to Army Deserters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka government has
declared a three-day amnesty from October 17 to 19 for army
deserters to rejoin the security forces, according to Defense
Ministry Friday.
</P>
<P>
Following appeals by the parents of a number of deserters, the
Defense Ministry has announced the amnesty from 8 am on Saturday
through to Monday which will be the final amnesty to be granted to
deserters, the Ministry sources said.

<P>
The sources said that the army and police units had recently
launched an island-wide massive operation to arrest deserters who
had not responded to earlier amnesties declared on several
occasions. Within only a few day after the operation began, over
2100 deserters had been arrested.

The sources pointed out that the deserters who surrender during
the amnesty period, would be re-trained, re-equipped and sent to

The sources estimated the current number of deserters at nearly
25,000 by May this year. Since 1995, the army has offered

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Study of Deng Xiaoping Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The front page of today's
People's Daily features the full text of a speech by Jiang Zemin
on the study of Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a work meeting held on July 17, 1998, Jiang, general
secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), called on the entire Party to further study Deng Xiaoping
Theory and carry it out in line with the guideline of the 15th CPC
National Congress.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that by this study, officials at various
levels will make new progress in understanding Deng Xiaoping
Theory and the guideline of the 15th CPC National Congress, and
push forward reform and construction.
</P>
<P>
Adhering to the basic guideline and principles of the Party
while eliminating various forms of interference has become a
serious test for Party members, especially for leading officials
at different levels, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
He noted that various problems have cropped up among a few
Party officials, and that a common reason is that they have paid
no attention to theoretical study and did not bear in mind the
tenets of Marxism.
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked party members to study Deng Xiaoping Theory and
transform their subjective world while transforming the objective
world.
</P>
<P>
All Party members, no matter who or what official rank they
bear, must learn to accept criticism and be courageous in
self-criticism. Jiang called on Party officials to treat comrades,
the Party organization and people correctly.
</P>
<P>
He said that all Party members should carry forward the Marxist
study style of integrating theory with practice. He criticized
some officials for being content with a scanty knowledge of Deng
Xiaoping Theory, and some officials for giving the excuse of
having no time to study, but in fact they are too busy with
unnecessary social activities.
</P>
<P>
Jiang finally stressed that Party committees at all levels and
officials in particular should make sure that Party members and
Party officials are armed with Deng Xiaoping Theory and launch a new
upsurge in studying theory.

<HEADLINE> Albania Reserved on Milosevic-Holbrooke Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government Thursday
showed a reserved attitude toward the agreement reached between
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. special envoy
Richard Holbrooke on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Prela, political consultant to the Albanian prime
minister, said the Albanian government was studying the agreement,
viewing it as a step that would likely lead to a settlement of the
Kosovo crisis, the Albanian Telegraphic Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This was Tirana's first comment on the latest Kosovo peace
deal.
</P>
<P>
Prela said that the Albanian government did not believe
Milosevic would fulfill his promise, and that the Yugoslav
president was a major obstacle to the settlement of the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said he personally regarded the Milosevic-Holbrooke
agreement as an old tactic by the Serbian leaders to stall for
time.
</P>
<P>
Prela said: "If Milosevic continues to provoke the West,
Albania will back the international community's 'adventurous
actions' for military intervention."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, Albania should work together with other
Balkan countries to prevent history from repeating itself to
become once again "the European powder keg."
</P>
<P>
Prela said Albania would respect the principle of dialogue and
a step-by-step solution if Milosevic kept his promise.
</P>
<P>
The Milosevic-Holbrooke agreement, which averted a possible
military operation by NATO, guarantees the withdrawal of Serbian
security forces from Kosovo and the deployment of international
monitoring personnel in the province.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also provides for the return of ethnic Albanian
refugees and displaced people to their homes, as well as free
movement of international aid agents.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Fallen Coalition Names D'Alema for Premiership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Italy's defeated center-left
alliance has nominated Massimo D'Alema, chief of the Democrat
Party of the Left, for the premiership, acting Deputy Prime
Minister Valter Veltroni said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema is secretary-general of the Democrat Party of the Left
-- the largest party in parliament with 171 of the 630 lower house
seats and accounting for more than half of the weight of the Olive
Tree coalition.
</P>
<P>
The coalition parties have unanimously agreed to recommend
D'Alema's candidacy to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro as Romano
Prodi, leader of Olive Tree, acknowledged failure to amass enough
support to form a new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
President Scalfaro had asked Prodi to check his popularity in
parliament after Prodi's resignation from premiership on the loss
of a confidence vote in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
The crisis began when the Communist Refoundation party, which
had backed Olive Tree since the 1996 elections, decided early this
month to withdraw its crucial support for the government's 1999
budget bill.
</P>
<P>
Prodi issued a statement on Thursday after the announcement of
D'Alema's candidacy, saying: "I think that the same plan which I
tried to implement can be carried forward by Massimo D'Alema for
the rest of the legislature."
</P>
<P>
"I hope that D'Alema will quickly be able to create a stable
government and a cohesive majority, as demanded by the important
role Italy has to play and the dramatic developments in the
international economy," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Any person entering or leaving
Vietnam must make a declaration to the customs office if they are
carrying more the 3,000 U.S. dollars, the same value in other

<HEADLINE> Study: Cow's Milk May Cause Constipation in Some Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Children with chronic
constipation will fare better if they drink soy milk instead of
cow's milk, researchers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine came as a result of a recent study conducted by a group
of researchers at the University of Palermo in Sicily.
</P>
<P>
In their study, the researchers surveyed 65 children under 6
who were taken to gastrointestinal experts for chronic
constipation. Although most cases were treated with laxatives, the
underlying causes of the condition were unclear.
</P>
<P>
Knowing these children were all drinking cow's milk or
milk-based infant formula, or eating other dairy products, the
researchers decided to test their response to a switch from cow's
milk to soy milk for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
They found that 44 of the 65 children had a positive response
while drinking soy milk; their constipation either eased or
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
To confirm their findings, the researchers later switched some
of the children back to cow's milk. "In all the patients,
constipation reappeared after 5 to 10 days of the (Cow's milk)
diet," reported Dr. Guiseppe Iacono, leader of the research team.
</P>
<P>
Based on their findings, researchers now recommend that
children with constipation should consider eliminating cow's milk
from their diet for a trial period.
</P>
<P>
Experts say chronic constipation affects about 16 percent of
infants and toddlers.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Makes Preparations for Sixth ASEAN Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is making preparations
for the coming Sixth Summit of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) scheduled to be held in Hanoi, Vietnam, in
December.
</P>
<P>
At the ASEAN Steering Committee meeting here Thursday,
Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar
State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), urged the ministries
concerned to make prior arrangements for the summit in time.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, the Second ASEAN Informal Summit was
held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, attended by SPDC Chairman
Senior-General Than Shwe for the first time. On the occasion,
Myanmar joined in signing a memorandum of understanding concerning
the setting up of the ASEAN Foundation and a protocol to
implement the initial package of commitments under the ASEAN
framework agreements on services.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Foundation to promote and strengthen people-to-people
contact was reportedly formally established later in July this
year in Jakarta, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In the same month, Myanmar Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw attended
the 31st ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Manila, the Philippines, and
joined in signing the Second Protocol of the Treaty of Amity and
Cooperation and the Joint Declaration on Drug Free ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Again in October, Myanmar Minister at the Office of the
Chairman of the SPDC Brigadier-General Abel also participated in
the 30th ASEAN Economic Ministers' Meeting in Manila and joined in
endorsing the Frame Work Agreement on ASEAN Investment Area and
the Protocol on the Notification of Procedures in connection with
the Common Effective Preferential Tariff Scheme.
</P>
<P>
Since integration into the ASEAN in July last year, Myanmar has
been working closely with other ASEAN members, forming respective
committees and groups in all sectors and taking an active part in
various meetings and activities of the association.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Largest Stock Exchange to Go Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada's largest stock exchange,
the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE), announced Thursday that it plans
to become more competitive by going public.
</P>
<P>
After changing from a mutual cooperative to a profit-making
company, "the TSE will become more entrepreneurial,
customer-focused and accountable to shareholders," the exchange
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The 146-year-old TSE accounts for more than 80 percent of all
stock traded in Canada. In 1997, more than 25.7 billion shares
worth more than 275 billion U.S. dollars, or about 2 billion
dollars a day, were traded.
</P>
<P>
In the past, investment dealers controlled the TSE by buying
seats on the exchange. But such a broad ownership made it difficult
to reach consensus.
</P>
<P>
TSE's latest plan for change was prompted in large part by a
steady erosion in the exchange's two businesses: trading shares
and acting as a forum for raising money.
</P>
<P>
More and more Canadian companies are listing their shares on
U.S. exchanges to raise cash. The exchange is also losing trading
volume to internal trading by investment dealers, particularly the
bank-owned houses, and to rival companies.
</P>
<P>
TSE's transition to a public company is expected to be
completed next year.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Approves Sending of Observers to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Thursday approved the
plan to send a "verification mission" of 2,000 international
observers to the troubled Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here, the OSCE's Permanent Council also authorized
the OSCE's chairman, Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, to
travel to Belgrade on Friday to sign with Yugoslav Foreign
Minister Zivadin Jovanovic a corresponding agreement on sending
international observers to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The team of observers will verify Yugoslavia's compliance with
the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1199, which calls
for an immediate ceasefire, a withdrawal of Serb forces from
Kosovo, the return of refugees, and the start of autonomy talks
with ethnic Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the OSCE mission to Kosovo was reached between
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic on Tuesday as NATO intensified its threat to launch
large-scale air strikes on Yugoslavia over the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to initial estimates by sources with the OSCE's
Permanent Council, the OSCE's verification mission will cost up to
200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
An advance team will be sent to Kosovo this weekend and will
arrive in Yugoslavia on Saturday "to begin preparing the ground
for deployment," a statement released after the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
A second group is expected to join those dispatched this
weekend by the end of next week.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Borrow From Japan Only What It Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October (Xinhua) -- Thailand will borrow from Japan's
30-billion-U.S.-dollar fund only the amount necessary to help the
country survive the economic crisis, according to Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin will go to Japan Saturday to negotiate with Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa the terms and amount of the borrowing.
</P>
<P>
Although Japan has offered to extend loans to Thailand, as well
as other Asian countries, Thailand would be careful not to
increase its external debt burden, Tarrin was quoted Friday by the
Bangkok post as saying.
</P>
<P>
"we will borrow only as we need, and we will have to spend
every dollar we get efficiently in strengthening our economy,"
Tarrin said.
</P>
<P>
The funding could be channeled through Thai private or state
banks, instead of being in the form of loans to the government, in
order to avoid budget difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Half of the 30 billion U.S. dollars is expected to be in the
form of medium-and long-term loan, with the remainder as
short-term trade financing.
</P>
<P>
During the past 12 months, Thailand has borrowed several
billion dollars from many international financial institutions,
including structural adjustment program loans of 1.2 billion U.S.
dollars from the Asian Development Bank, 1.5 billion U.S. dollars
from the World Bank, 150 million U.S. dollars for small-scale
investment projects from the World Bank, 117.5 billion yen from
Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund as well as loans from
the 17.2-billion-U.S.-dollar bailout package sponsored by the IMF.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vows Hard Work in Opening Mideast Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
vowed to work hard to reach an agreement when he opened peace talks
between Israeli and Palestinian leaders at an eastern Maryland
retreat.
</P>
<P>
"There is hard work ahead if we are to reach an agreement...
Our entire team (is) ready to do whatever we can. We are ready to
get to work," Clinton told the opening session of the summit talks
at the Wye River Conference Center on the eastern shore of
Chesapeak Bay.
</P>
<P>
"All of us are determined to keep our energies focused on the
talks," Clinton said as he sat down with the delegations led by
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The United States wants the leaders to stay four or five days
in hopes of breaking a 19-month deadlock on the next stage of
Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories and on Israel's
security demands from the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
And it also hoped to reach an agreement to pave the way for
talks on a permanent peace deal between Israelis and the
Palestinians, which is to be completed by May 1999 under the
five-year old Oslo peace process.
</P>
<P>
Earlier at the White House, Clinton urged Netanyahu and Arafat
to "break the logjam" in peace negotiations. "Too much time has
already been lost," he said with the two leaders standing
alongside him in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called for "a genuine Israeli-Palestinian partnership
that will stand the test of time." He urged both leaders to take
the long view as they headed into negotiations and ready to make
concessions.
</P>
<P>
"As in any difficult problem, neither side can expect to win
100 percent of every point," he said. "But concessions that seem
hard now will seem far less important in the light of an accord
that moves Israelis and Palestinians closer to lasting peace."
</P>
<P>
The talks will focus on a U.S. proposal for Israel to pull back
troops from a further 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
specific Palestinian security commitments.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright will take the lead
day-to-day role at the talks, which Clinton would join whenever
necessary.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials warned that the Middle East peace process faced
a "looming disaster" unless there was speedy progress because of
the May 4 deadline for a final agreement and Arafat's threat to
declare a Palestinian state in the absence of a final accord.
</P>
<P>
The summit is modeled on the marathon Egyptian-Israeli
negotiation at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland,
in 1978 and the Bosnian peace talks at an Air Force base near
Dayton, Ohio, in 1995.

SHANGHAI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a state-level
software park began recently in Shanghai, China's leading
industrial and commercial center.
</P>
<P>
The Pudong Software Park, co-funded by the Ministry of the
Information Industry and Shanghai Municipality, plans to become a

in California in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the development of the park is in line with China's
efforts to bring modern information technology into its economy.
</P>
<P>
The park, with an area of 150,000 square meters in the Pudong
New Area, will open to outstanding software enterprises and
technicians from both home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
In addition to infrastructure, the park plans to set up a
service system mainly consisting of a software production center,
software evaluation services and training centers.
</P>
<P>
The first phase, involving at least 150 million yuan in
investment, is scheduled for completion next September. About 30
information enterprises are expected to occupy the new park.

SOFIA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A Yugoslavian diamond thief
wanted by Interpol was arrested at a Bulgarian Customs checkpoint,
the Bulgaria Interior Ministry press office said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Human Rights Activists Face Terror, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian human rights
activists have said that the murder of a volunteer rape counselor
was an act of intimidation and terror against those helping sexual
assault victims from May riots, national newspapers reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The body of Martadinata Haryono, better known as Ita, a
counselor with the Volunteers for Humanity, was found in her home
here last Friday night, with stab wounds and a slashed neck.
</P>
<P>
Ita, 18, was a member of the ethnic Chinese minority. She had
been helping other ethnic Chinese women raped during the riots.
Police have arrested a 20-year-old male neighbor Suryadi, who
claims he killed her during a bungled burglary.
</P>
<P>
Romo Sandyawan, a Roman Catholic priest who leads the
Volunteers for Humanity, said other members of his group had been
harassed and threatened by those who don't want the truth known
about the rapes.
</P>
<P>
"The assassination of Ita can't be simply parted from the
intimidation and terror that continuously shakes other members of
the Volunteers for Humanity," Sandyawan told reporters here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the team will never give up its struggle to reveal the
truth to the public, despite receiving death threats on a daily
basis.
</P>
<P>
The priest said police have overlooked many vital facts in
their investigation into Ita's murder. When the volunteer team
came to Ita's house, there were many puzzling sights.
</P>
<P>
"We saw stains of blood on the doors and windows, but no blood
in the victim's room, nor was there any blood on the staircase up
to her room," he added.
</P>
<P>
Human rights activist Munir told reporters that the public no
longer trusts police in controversial murder cases.
</P>
<P>
He said police do not bother to reveal facts, but instead
spread possibly false information that aims to discredit the
victim. For example, police invited a psychologist to publicly
claim that Ita had been sodomized for many years.
</P>
<P>
Munir said it was unusual for the police to present the suspect
to the public.
</P>
<P>
"The suspect has the right to be protected and considered
innocent until proven guilty," he added.
</P>
<P>
The public suspects police are hiding the truth, because they
have done so in the past, such as in the 1994 murder of labor
rights activist Marsinah, and the 1996 killing of outspoken
journalist Udin, said Munir.
</P>
<P>
The Volunteers for Humanity was the first organization to raise
the alarm about the systematic gang-rapes during the May riots.
The non-governmental organization reported to the National
Commission on Human Rights in July that at least 168 women and
children were raped or sexually abused during the riots in Jakarta
and other cities.
</P>
<P>
The government established a fact-finding team in July to
investigate allegations that the riots were masterminded. The team
is expected to complete its task on October 23.

<HEADLINE> Living Space in Shanghai Expanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The average per capita living
space in this densely populated city had more than doubled since
1978 due to massive housing construction.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Shanghai has built over 100 million
sq. m. of residential housing since 1978, enabling the per capita
living space to expand from 4.5 sq. m. to 9.3 sq. m. The rate of
single-household flats with complete facilities such as kitchens and
toilets has surpassed 60 percent, compared with 40 percent 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attribute the fast housing development to a
shift from the decades-old welfare housing distribution system to
a market-oriented one.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises and individuals have replaced the government as the
main source of investment. Foreign investors have also joined in
housing construction, helping foster a real estate market.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the city has invested 187.2 billion yuan
in residential housing over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Over 2.4 million sq. m. of old and simply equipped housing has
been replaced by new residential apartments with complete
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to further raise the average per capita living
space to 10 sq. m. by the year 2000, and the rate of apartments with
complete facilities to 70 percent.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: Myanmar's Gems Business Makes Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is rich with underground
mineral resources especially precious gemstones such as ruby,
sapphire, jade in addition to metals.
</P>
<P>
Formerly, the state-run Myanmar Gems Enterprise (MGE) under the
Ministry of Mines was the sole organization which undertakes
gemstone and jade mining, playing the major role in earning the
large amount of income for the state.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the market-oriented economic system
introduced in late 1988, the MGE has extended its extraction areas
from the previous Mogok and Mogaung in Kachin state to Pyinlon,
Mongshu, Lor Hsaungtauk and Sai Lian in Shan state and has
undertaken mining, processing and sale of gemstones and
manufactured items.
</P>
<P>
The MGE could promote the sale in local and foreign currencies
by holding annual gems emporiums beginning 1964 on competitive
bidding basis, adding mid-year ones starting 1992 and including
interim sales later on.
</P>
<P>
From the last 35 annual and six mid-year events, participated
on each occasion by hundreds of merchants from more than 20
countries and regions, Myanmar earned more than 260 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Beginning 1990, the Myanmar government cooperated with local
private individuals and firms for joint mining of gemstones.
</P>
<P>
In addition to permitting the local private sector to mine and
process gems in the country, the government also set up joint
ventures with companies from Thailand, Malaysia and Israel,
carrying out gems extraction and processing for sale in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Of them, the joint venture with Thailand's VES Group formed in
1993, is making progress.
</P>
<P>
Now, Myanmar is capable of putting on sale its gems and jewelry
at international jewelry shows in Israel, Singapore and China's
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar promulgated the new Gemstone Law in September 1995,
granting local entrepreneurs to mine, produce, transport and sell
finished gemstone and manufactured jewelry at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
There is also a Myanmar Gems Museum built in Yangon, the sole
museum of its kind standing as an impressive edifice in Southeast
Asia with the world's largest ruby, weighing 21,450 carats on
display among others.
</P>
<P>
It was dug from Kin village in Mogok Gemstone tract, while nine
other precious stones were designated as regal in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The government is also striving to create a systematic gem
market in the country, aimed at directly selling gems abroad in an
effort to develop its gems services.
</P>
<P>
The newly establishing gem market known as the Pinlong in
Yangon is heading for becoming a gem trade center in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Since late 1988, three new gemlands have been discovered in
Myanmar which are the Nawarat (Pyinlon), Namsa and Mongshu in
addition to the old Mogok and Mokaung.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the output value of Myanmar's
mining sector, which includes gems and jade, rose 1.5 percent in
1997-98 fiscal year which ended in March and the production of
gems and jade in the fiscal year went to 24.7 million carats and
2.7 million kilos respectively.

<HEADLINE> Serbia Reiterates Rejection to NATO Deployment in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Serbia Thursday reiterated its
firm opposition against any military deployment by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in its troubled province of
Kosovo, Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Vojislav Seselj, deputy prime
minister of the Serbian republic -- one of the two republics
making up Yugoslavia -- at a meeting with parliamentary
delegations from Russia and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Seselj said Yugoslavia highly appreciated the resolute support
by Russian and Belarus parliaments in its efforts to defend state
sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as to oppose NATO's
military intervention.
</P>
<P>
The visiting legislators said that the Kosovo issue was purely
an internal matter of Yugoslavia and that Russia and Belarus
firmly opposed the attempts by the United States and other Western
countries at military intervention in the internal affairs of a
sovereign state, which was in violation of international norms.
</P>
<P>
The delegates hailed the latest agreement between Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on
peaceful settlement of the Kosovo crisis, stressing the deal had
important significance, not only for Serbia and Yugoslavia, but
also for the security of the entire Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The flight of foreign
capital from the Brazilian stock market continues, the Folha de
Sao Paulo newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the country lost nearly 432 million U.S.
dollars Wednesday, of which 305 million dollars left through the
commercial finance market and 127 million dollars through the

<P>
Brazilian economists say the flight of foreign capital from the
country's financial market is expected to amount to 2 billion
dollars to 2.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The flight of dollars from Brazil is a result of the
international financial crisis in August and September when 12
billion dollars and 18.77 billion dollars were withdrawn
respectively from the country.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian international reserves dropped from 74 billion
dollars at the end of July to a current 45 billion dollars.

BELGRADE, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Crvena Zvezda Belgrade are to
appeal against a UEFA order that the Yugoslavian club should
play their European tie at a neutral venue because of political
tension over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Zevezda, formerly known as Red Star, was on Thursday told by
the European soccer governing body to play a UEFA Cup
second-round first-leg tie against Olympique Lyon of France on
October 20 in Bucharest because of tensions over Yugoslavia's
volatile province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Zvezda have said playing at a neutral venue would mean some
300,000 U.S. dollars shortfall in the club's ticket revenue.

lake.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Communications and the Xinjiang Production and

spite of the absence of water and the very changeable weather, Lop
Nor has an interesting saline and alkaline landscape and can
provide a sense of adventure for anyone wanting to visit. It has
already received over over 25,000 people in travel groups and

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banks Give Greater Backing to Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The banking industry in this
port city in northern China has increased its backing for local
economic growth this year, extending a total of 10.7 billion yuan
in loans in the past eight months to August, up 14 percent from
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China, the country's largest bank, plans to increase its lending
portfolio by 6.5 billion yuan this year, giving priority to 50
large enterprises producing automobiles, oil, petrochemicals,
traditional Chinese medicine, and magnetic cards.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the newly-added bank loans, these enterprises
generated nearly six billion yuan in output value in September, an
increase of six percent from a year ago and a rise of 9.5 percent
from August.
</P>
<P>
Since August, the Agricultural Bank of China branch and other
financial institutions have made more than 500 million yuan in
loans to rural and township enterprises, which are expected to
increase their revenues by more than a billion yuan in revenues
and and tax payment by 100 million yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions in Tianjin have also increased support
for overseas-funded and private enterprises with 670 million yuan
in loans in the first eight months.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investors are
sharply increasing their presence in Shenzhen, the special
economic zone in Guangdong Province, south China, official sources
said today.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year, Shenzhen approved 1,527
overseas-funded projects, involving a total contractual overseas
investment of 2.1 billion U.S. dollars. The figures represented an
increase of 22.6 percent and 78.3 percent, respectively, from one
year ago. The amount of overseas investment actually used reached
1.94 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 84.3 percent of the
year's target.
</P>
<P>
Preferential policies designed to encourage overseas investment
in high-tech industries have worked very well. In the nine months,
nearly half of the new overseas-funded projects were in high-tech
industries, with 380 million U.S. dollars in contracts.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that Shenzhen can reach its target of 2.3
billion U.S. dollars in foreign investment this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the Czech Republic
Thursday signed a 15-year contract worth 10 billion U.S. dollars
for the sale and delivery of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, Russia is to supply the Czech Republic with
seven billion cubic meters of natural gas each year, sources here
said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first long-term contract of its kind between the
two countries. All previous contracts were signed on a short-term
basis with the longest one being effective for three years.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed that the contract would be
automatically extended for another 10 years provided it was
implemented to the satisfaction of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Lacking natural gas resources, the Czech Republic has to rely
on imports to meet its domestic needs.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 90 percent of the republic's natural gas was imported
from Russia, the major supplier to the Czech Republic. Norway
provided another 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic and Russia also signed a 10-year contract
regarding Russia's transport of natural gas to Western Europe
through the Czech Republic.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Will New Round of Pak-Indian Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Will the new round of foreign
secretary level talks between Pakistan and India make a
difference?
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad and his Indian
counterpart K. Ragunath will hold their first round of formal
talks here from Friday on issues of peace and security and the
Kashmir dispute after a year-long gap.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which will last until Sunday, follow an
understanding reached between the prime ministers of Pakistan and
India when they met in New York last month on the sidelines of the
U.N. General Assembly Session.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders decided to revive the bilateral dialogue which
was stalled in September last year as both of them saw the
necessity for an environment for durable peace and peaceful
settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
A second round to discuss other bilateral issues will take
place in New Delhi from November 5-13.
</P>
<P>
The history of the bilateral negotiations between Islamabad and
New Delhi is quite depressing. All previous such parleys have so
far failed to go beyond discussing modalities and procedural
matters. The main reason is that the two sides' stances on issues
dividing them, especially the Kashmir, are seemingly
uncompromising.
</P>
<P>
The territorial dispute over the Himalayan state has rendered
all previous efforts fruitless, with Pakistan insisting the
Kashmir issue be resolved before any other agreements can be
reached. Meanwhile, despite its repeated adherence to the
principle of bilateralism, India has been reluctant to take up the
Kashmir issue. Will this time be any different?
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that there would be no dramatic
breakthrough in the Islamabad talks as all the signs show that
neither Islamabad nor New Delhi has softened their declared
positions though both the foreign secretaries hope that the
outcome of their talks would be "positive and constructive."
</P>
<P>
"India is committed to fostering friendly and peaceful
relations with Pakistan - we will conduct these talks in a serious
and purposeful manner," Indian Foreign Secretary Ragunath told
reporters upon his arrival at the Islamabad Airport Thursday
evening.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated New Delhi's stance that "there is no room for
third party involvement."
</P>
<P>
"We believe the only way to discuss our relations or to discuss
issues and also to discuss other aspects of relationship is
through a direct bilateral dialogue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad, who greeted Ragunath at
the airport, also said Pakistan enters into dialogue with India
with the sincerity of purpose in a bid to settle all outstanding
matters including the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"The drastically changed regional environment requires us to
work for durable peace and durable solutions, and for durable
solutions we have to take bold decisions in accordance with our
international and bilateral commitments."
</P>
<P>
Shamshad said the whole world is now looking at these
negotiations with the expectation that India will finally abandon
its intransigence, accept that it is in illegal occupation of
Jammu and Kashmir and agree that the Kashmiris should exercise
their right of self-determination in accordance with the U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
However, most analysts and officials here hope that the two
countries should make some tension-defusing bilateral arrangements
in the realm of peace and security and agree on parameters of
future rounds of talks between Islamabad and New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
"What is needed is the will to find a solution acceptable to
all the parties concerned, backed by a rational and realistic
approach," said Prof. Afzal Mahmood in his article carried by The
Dawn recently. "To begin with, it should be agreed upon by the two
countries how to keep the dialogue going uninterrupted."
</P>
<P>
"Because of the historical encumbrance and the complexity of
the issue involved, the Pak-Indian dialogue has to be a long drawn
out process which should be sustained long enough to produce any
results," he emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Watson Joins Villa as Gullit Starts Clear-out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Newcastle utility player Steve
Watson has joined Aston Villa for four million pounds as Ruud
Gullit begins his Newcastle overhaul.
</P>
<P>
Watson, whose fee is based on appearances, parted company with
his home-town club to sign a five-year deal at Villa Park.
</P>
<P>
There had been widespread speculation about his future for
several weeks, since it became clear that changes to the playing
staff would be made when Gullit replaced Kenny Dalglish as
manager.
</P>
<P>
The Dutchman had made it known he was prepared to let Watson
go in return for a hefty transfer fee to fund his rebuilding work
at St James' Park.
</P>
<P>
But while Southampton and Sunderland were known to be chasing
the 24-year-old England B international, Villa boss John Gregory,
armed with the proceeds from the sale of striker Dwight Yorke to
Manchester United, pounced.
</P>
<P>
Watson, who is expected to go straight into the squad for
Villa's clash with West Ham United at Upton Park on Saturday,
said: "When I was told I could leave and Villa were interested
then there was no problem joining a club at the top of the
Premier League.
</P>
<P>
"I'm amazed that Villa have already built up such a commanding
points lead so early in the season, but this is an indication of
the quality that is in the side.
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect to get into the side straight away after such
a fine start. I will have to fight for my place," Watson added.
</P>
<P>
Gregory, who has spent heavily since taking over from Brian
Little last March, said: "Steve Watson gives us a little more
experience.
</P>
<P>
"There is no guarantee that he will go straight into the team
but he appreciates the position that exists at the present time.
</P>
<P>
"I've been keen to add to my first team squad and Watson is
another quality player.
</P>
<P>
"It is far better to make these sorts of signings when the
team is winning and in such good form.
</P>
<P>
"I look upon Steve Watson as a very important addition to the
squad and he will give us a lot more strength, " he added.

<HEADLINE>   England Fans Criticise World Cup Policing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 15 (Xinhua) - The Football
Supporters' Association (FSA) slammed on Thursday the policing of
England fans during the World Cup finals in France last summer.
</P>
<P>
It also described the ticket distribution system at the
tournament in France as "disgraceful".
</P>
<P>
FSA presented a detailed report on what it called the "Fans'
View" of the finals to the British government's Football Task
Force and English soccer officials.
</P>
<P>
The findings in the 32-page report were based on information
from FSA observers at the tournament and questionnaires completed
by around 500 fans.
</P>
<P>
"The report slams the disgraceful ticket distribution system
which forced thousands of fans to pay extortionate black market
ticket prices," the FSA said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It exposes the media's role in inflaming problem situations.
It criticises the policing of England fans which punished the
vast majority of innocent fans whilst failing to deal with
troublemakers."
</P>
<P>
English fans complained before the tournament that not enough
tickets had been made available to fans outside of France.
English hooligans were involved in trouble during the tournament,
notably in Marseille.
</P>
<P>
The report contains witness statements alleging incidents of
media personnel paying both English and French fans to throw
missiles and burn flags.
</P>
<P>
"This is the most comprehensive analysis to date of the real
experiences of our supporters abroad," said Kevin Miles, the
author of the report.
</P>
<P>
"The existence of the massive black market is proof in itself t
hat the ticket system failed to put the tickets into the hands of
genuine fans who wanted to see the matches.
</P>
<P>
"Authorities need to listen to these fans if the mistakes of
this tournament are not be repeated in the future."

LONDON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- China and Malaysia are set to
stage Formula One Grand Prix races next year, according to a
provisional calendar released by the international governing body
for motor sport FIA on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
China will host the second race of the season at Zhuhai on

as Formula One begins to move away from its traditional European
hearland, with governments in European nations stamping down on
the tobacco-funded advertising that provides crucial support.
</P>
<P>
The San Marino and Hungarian Grands Prix are included on the
provisional calendar, subject to those races meeting FIA
requirements.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian race organisers have been fined one million U.S.
dollars for a track invasion by spectators after the 1998 race,
with 75 per cent suspended unless there is a similar occurrence
in the next two years.

<HEADLINE> Indian Delegation Arrives for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 15 (Xinhua) -- An eight-member delegation
headed by Indian Foreign Secretary K. Ragunath arrived here
Thursday night for bilateral talks to be opened Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Indian delegation was met at the airport by Pakistan's
Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed and other senior officials from
the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming talks on foreign secretary level will last for
three days and it will be the first formal one between the two
South Asian countries after their nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, K. Ragunath and his Pakistani counterpart
Shamshad Ahmad will discuss issues of peace and security and the
Kashmir dispute, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the two Foreign Secretaries are going to take up the
issues of peace and security including confidence building
measures, while talks on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute will be
held on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Firing across the line of control, incidents on Siachen glacier
and restraint and stabilization regime in the backdrop of nuclear
tests will come under discussion in talks, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the closing session will be held on
Sunday morning and the Indian delegation will leave for home in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan decided to resume the foreign secretary
level talks after a 13-month impasse when their prime ministers
met in New York in September on the sidelines of the United
Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion the two prime ministers stressed the necessity
for an environment for durable peace and peaceful settlement of
the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
The last round of Pak-Indian talks collapsed in New Delhi in
September last year after controversy surfaced over modalities for
discussion on eight bilateral issues including the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has expressed concern at "the nature, timing and
scale" of the military exercises India are set to carry out near
the Pak-India border, but declared that it will enter the talks
"with an open mind and the sincerity of purpose."

<HEADLINE> Olympic Bomb Charges Filed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Federal authorites charged
Eric Robert Rudolph the elusive fugitive sought in the bomb of
the Olympic park bombing of 1996 and two other Atlanta-area
terroist attacks Wedensday.
</P>
<P>
"This warrant moves us one step closer to ending a campaign of
violence," said John Magaw of the Bureau of Alcoho, Tobacco and
Firearms.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Olympics bombing, Rudolph was formally
charged in last year's attacks against a north Atlanta abortion
clinic and a local gay nightclub. Nine people were injured in
those explosions.
</P>
<P>
In Febraury, Rudolph was charged with this year's bombing of a
clinic in Birminghan. A police officer was killed and a nurse was
seriously injuired in the blast. Two people died and 100 were
injured in the Olympics bombing.
</P>
<P>
Nails and steel plates recovered from the Olympic park and
Atlanta clinic bomb sites were similar, authorites said. The
similarities helped authorities link Rudolph to the bombings,
they said. They would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
His name was added to the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list this year,
and a 1 million U.S. dollars award has been offered for
information leading to his conviction.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the new charges, federal officials solicited the
public's help in capturing Rudolph. Attorney General Janet Reno
and FBI Director Louis Freeh released a photograph showing
Rudolph in khaki shorts and a green T-shirt that investigators
believe Rudolph was wearing in Atlanda the day of the Olympics
blast.
</P>
<P>
Since January, Rudolph has been the subject of a massive
manhunt focused in Nantahala National Forest in western North
Carolina, near his hometown of Murphy.
</P>
<P>
At times as many as 200 agents beat through the rugged terrain
searching for Rudolph, an experienced outdoorsman.
</P>
<P>
"Eric Rudolph is on the run," Reno said. "Hundreds of agents
are on his tail."
</P>
<P>
Authorities fear that Rudolph is getting help, possibly from
anti-abortion sympathizers.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho opposition
parties Thursday asked leaders of South Africa, Botswana,
Mozambique and Zimbabwe to intervene following the arrest of 30
soldiers who allegedly participated in a mutiny in early
September.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted opposition alliance
spokesman Vincent Malebu as saying that the alliance had conveyed
a message to South African Security Minister Sydney Mufamady, who
led the delegation to Lesotho for multiparty talks aimed at
breaking the country's political impasse.
</P>
<P>
Mufamady's office confirmed that the minister was briefed on
the new developments in Lesotho, but gave no more details.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho's Army Chief Tanki Mothae said earlier that an
investigation into the alleged involvement of those arrested had
been launched in Maseru, the capital of Lesotho. He said it was
too early to say what charges they would face.
</P>
<P>
Junior Lesotho soldiers launched a mutiny in early September,
accusing Lesotho's Defense Force Chief Makhule Mosaken and 28
other senior army officers of being puppets of the ruling Lesotho
Congress for Democracy (LCD). Mosaken and the senior officers
were forced to resign at gun point.
</P>
<P>
The LCD was alleged by the opposition alliance to have rigged
in the May 23 general elections.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the kingdom's defense act, any person found
to have been involved in mutiny, or who intended to joint it,
could be charged with treason, punishable by death.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Civil Servants Apply for Earlier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- About 1900 Zambian civil
servants have applied for earlier retirement in response to the
Voluntary Separation Package (VSP) floated by the government last
February as part of measures to reduce the country's bloated
civil service.
</P>
<P>
The VSP was devised by the Zambian government as one of the
measures under its on-going Public Service Reform Program (PSRP)
aimed at shedding off its excess manpower.
</P>
<P>
Robert Makola, PSRP acting director of communications, told
Zambia News Agency ZANA in Lusaka Thursday that since the VSP was
floated in February this year, a total of 1903 civil servants
have responded positively.
</P>
<P>
Their applications for earlier retirement under the VSP are
currently being processed while payments for the separation
packages would start soon, said Makola.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government announced in its 1998 budget that it
was committed to reducing the civil service by about 80,000
people within three years.
</P>
<P>
The major reason for reducing the civil service is that
efficiency in the civil service is boosted through retaining a
small and manageable cadre of professional manpower that will
effectively deliver social services to the people.
</P>
<P>
According to former Finance Minister, Ronald Penza, the
current civil service in Zambia is bloated, inefficient and a
huge drain on tax payers money.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Egypt Pin Hopes on Washington Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawneh said here Thursday that Jordan and Egypt have spotted
signs that the ongoing U.S.-brokered Palestinian-Israeli summit
will yield positive results.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt have noticed a desire on both sides to resolve
their standing problems and a determination on part of the U.S. to
strike out a formula that can be acceptable to the two parties,
said Tarawneh upon his return from Cairo.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Cairo, Tarawneh met with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak on various issues, mainly the Washington summit.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh specially noted the intention of the Palestinians,
Israel and the U.S. to reach a breakthrough in the long-stalled
Middle East peace process and prepare for the final status
talks. But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh left for Cairo earlier Thursday to deliver a verbal
message from Crown Prince Hassan, the regent, to Mubarak and brief
him on Hassan's cautious optimism about the summit. Both Jordan
and Egypt have been active mediators of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Washington summit started earlier Thursday primarily for
clinching an agreement on further Israeli troops withdrawal from
the West Bank based on the U.S. peace initiative put forward early
this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal calls on Israel to withdraw its troops from
13.1 percent more of the West Bank in return for stepped-up
Palestinian crackdown on terrorism. It was aimed to reactivate the
long-stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians accepted the proposal, while Israel rejected
it citing security concerns.
</P>
<P>
However, after rounds of mediation by the concerned parties,
Israel became flexible last month and decided to convene with
the Palestinians in U.S. to hammer out a deal.

The Zambian government announced in its 1998 budget that it
was committed to reducing the civil service by about 80,000
people within three years.
</P>
<P>
The major reason for reducing the civil service is that
efficiency in the civil service is boosted through retaining a
small and manageable cadre of professional manpower that will
effectively deliver social services to the people.
</P>
<P>
According to former Finance Minister, Ronald Penza, the
current civil service in Zambia is bloated, inefficient and a
huge drain on tax payers money.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Crisis in Nigeria to Persist Till 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria may not see an end to
the perennial scarcity of petroleum products until January next
year when the country's four refineries are expected to be put
back in shape.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Akilaja, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union
of Petroleum and Gas Workers (NUPEGW), said in Nigerian capital
Abuja Wednesday that the government had assured in a recent
meeting with NUPEGW officials that all the broken refineries
would be revitalized in the next three months, The Post Express
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The West African country has been hit by fuel crisis since
early 1997, and former Petroleum Minister Dan Etete promised
early this year that the crisis would be solved by last
September.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the Warri Refinery last week, which was the only
one functioning of four refineries in the country, has heightened
fears of a worsening of the lingering nationwide fuel scarcity.
</P>
<P>
The persistent fuel crisis has taken deep toll on the nation's
economic activities as some industries are forced to shut down
operations and thousands of workers waste their times at bus
stops.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts here said that the restoration of normal
fuel supply in the country is one of the remarkable legacies
expected from the regime of General Abdulsalami Abubakar.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland's Elections Boycotted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A tug-of-war has been
intensifying between the Swazi government and forces calling for a
boycott of Friday's non-party general elections, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Swazi government is urging people in the kingdom to vote,
declaring Friday a paid public holiday to enable workers to vote in
their home constituencies if they wish, SAPA quoted
unidentified Swazi sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 canidates are preparing to contest 55 parliament seats.
</P>
<P>
However, the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions, which supports
the election boycott until political parties are unbanned, has told
its members to go to work.
</P>
<P>
Under the current Swazil constitution approved in October 1978,
the king is the top leader of Swaziland, and no party is allowed to be
established in the country, which is bordering with South Africa and
Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> Only One Fifths of Zambian New Voters Register </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Less than one fifths of Zambian
eligible new voters have registered to vote in the country's
forthcoming local government elections, the date for which has
not been announced.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures released by the Electoral Commision
Thursday in Lusaka, only 291,672 people registered throughout the
country during the just-ended five-week long voter registration
exercise, showing a serious shortfall to the targeted 1.5 million
new voters.
</P>
<P>
Zambia with a population of 9.6 million had 2.2 million
registered voters in 1996 before the country's general elections
in that year. And this year, the Electoral Commission expected to
register 1.5 million new voters to bring the total to 3.7 million
out of the country's 4.3 million eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, which started on August 24 and was scheduled to
end on September 13, had to be extended twice due to voter
apathy.
</P>
<P>
The Electoral Commission extended the exercise for another two
weeks to end it on September 27 in a bid to register more voters.
</P>
<P>
Bobby Bwalya, Chairman of the Electoral Commission, last month
attributed the prevailing voter apathy to the people's loss of
confidence in their elected representatives.
</P>
<P>
The local government elections which should have taken place
in 1995, have been delayed for a period of three years.
</P>
<P>
The date for the polls will be designated by the head of
state, President Frederick Chiluba. People believe it should be
some day before the rainy season comes next month.

<HEADLINE> Iran Continues Mediating Between Syria, Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran stepped up its mediation
efforts Thursday by sending a message to Syrian President Hafez
Al-Assad on defusing tension between Syrian and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The message of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami was conveyed
by Iran's ambassador to Syria Hussein Sheikh-El-Islam during a
reception, according to the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi met with
Turkish ambassador to Iran in Tehran, expressing his country's
desire to continue its efforts to bring about an understanding
between Turkey and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi visited the two countries earlier this month trying to
persuade leaders of the two countries to seek peaceful solution to
their dispute rather than resorting to military options.
</P>
<P>
Iran, the current chairman of the Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC), believes that any military confrontation between
the two Muslim nations will benefit enemies of the Islamic world,
especially Israel.
</P>
<P>
Tensions mounted recently between Syria and Turkey after they
traded accusations against each other, and Turkey reportedly
massed troops along its border with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors have long been at odds over issues including
Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), water sharing and
the Turkish-Israeli military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Syria of harboring the PKK rebels, who
have been fighting against the Turkish government since 1984 for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Syria has lashed out at Turkey, a predominantly Muslim
country, for forming a military alliance with Israel, which it
says is targeted against the Arab world, especially itself, and
undermines its bargaining position in negotiations with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Israel is still occupying Syria's Golan Heights, captured in
the 1967 Middle East war. Damascus insisted on its return as a
condition for peace with the Jewish state.

ATHENS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis Thursday discussed with visiting Austrian Chancellor
Viktor Klima the forthcoming informal European Union (EU) summit
which will take place in Austria later this month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their talks, Simitis said that the EU had made
great achievements towards the single market, but the question
remaining was what would follow European Monetary Union and how
Europe could intervene on an international level to secure
stability and make progress on major issues such as employment,
social policy and internal security so as to have a new European
dynamism.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Klima, whose country is currently holding the
six-month rotating EU presidency, said that the group had already
started accession negotiations with six candidate countries,
including Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission would present a progress report about
the other five candidates at the EU summit in December in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
As for Turkey's European prospects, he said that Turkey had
failed to meet the criteria for EU accession.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Invites Pakistan Premier to Visit U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has invited Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to Washington in
December to discuss the country's economic problems and the fight
against terrorism, a U.S. official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at the possibility of his coming over for an
official working visit probably the first part of December.... The
offer is there if he would like to do that," Assistant Secretary
of State Karl Defenserth told a meeting of the Defense Writers
group.
</P>
<P>
The visit would recognize steps taken by Sharif's government in
addressing concerns about the country's nuclear program and the
U.S. gratitude for Islamabad's help in apprehending suspects in
the August bombing of American embassies in east Africa.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress is expected this week to approve legislation
allowing Clinton to waive for one year sweeping sanctions imposed
on India and Pakistan for conducting nuclear tests last May that
threaten an arms race in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Also, the United States credits Pakistan with major help in
fighting terrorism, such as apprehending suspects wanted in the
August bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Last month Clinton decided to cancel a trip to India and
Pakistan tentatively set for November because U.S. officials felt
neither country had made enough progress on the nuclear issue to
warrant that kind of high-profile trip.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Congress' Approval Slipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Support for the
Republican-controlled Congress has slipped after the House of
Representatives voted to open a formal impeachment inquiry into
President Bill Clinton's conduct, said a poll released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With only three weeks before midterm elections, nearly half of
all voters surveyed said this Congress has accomplished less than
a typical Congress and most Americans could not name one
accomplishment of the Congress this year, according to a CBS/New
York Times poll.
</P>
<P>
Approval of Congress has dropped to 43 percent from a high of
56 percent in September as the House has been spending much of its
time dealing with the allegations against Clinton by special
prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Forty-eight percent of the public now
disapproves of the job Congress is doing.
</P>
<P>
The president's job approval is at 63 percent, with 70 percent
approving of his handling of the economy and 60 percent approving
of his job on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The poll suggested the president is given more credit for
trying to find a solution to the budget debate than the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Democrats have worried that Clinton's problems could hurt their
election chances this year. But the congressional race is a
statistical dead heat among likely voters, with 48 percent saying
they would support a Democratic candidate and 46 percent saying
they would back a Republican. Republican strength increases among
voters who are most intensely committed to voting, so a low
turnout election could hurt Democrats, the poll found.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 926 adults was taken Monday and Tuesday and has a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Former Burundian President Urges Warring Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The former president of
Burundi, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, has asked his country's
warring parties to seize chance of reconciliation at the on-going
peace talks, meeting sources said in Arusha Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ntibantunganya, who was toppled in 1996 by Major Pierre Buyoya
in a military coup, said that the peace talks mediated by
Tanzania's former president Julius Nyerere can bring genuine
peace to Burundi, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
"A chance for democracy and good governance is there only if
all of us seize this opportunity here," he told various parties
at the beginning of the third round of peace talks in Tanzania's
northern town of Arusha Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a closed-door session, Ntibantunganya said Burundi has been
tired of bloodshed and "the time for peace has come and we should
dedicate ourselves to that," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Contributing to the same debate, a rebel group, Frolina, has
proposed for a general amnesty and formation of a truth
commission to end the conflict in Burundi, in which more than
150,000 people have been killed since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The group's leader, Joseph Karumba, said that general amnesty
is needed to allow six million Burundians who have got fed up
with mass killings and wars to make a new start.
</P>
<P>
Karumba further said the issue of impunity needs to be
addressed as a matter of urgency, as the recall of past killings
and exchanges of accusations are obstacles to reconciliation and
dialog.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the international community should strengthen the
independence of judiciary to restore public trust in the system.
</P>
<P>
Frolina recommends a seven-point peace package to end the
ethnic civil war in Burundi, he said, adding that it includes
free choice of leaders, free political participation, fair
elections, respect for minority and equitable distribution of
power and opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Other sides from Burundi which have spoken at the session
include the National Assembly, Inkinzo, PL, PSD, ANNADE, PIT and
UPRONA.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters Thursday, Hashim Mbita, the spokesman for
Nyerere, said the meeting atmosphere is "very positive and
encouraging."
</P>
<P>
Mbita also said the first item of the agenda -- debate on
democracy and government, may wind up Friday.
</P>
<P>
The warring parties signed a cease-fire agreement in the first
round of talks in June and dwelt mainly on the genesis of the
Burundi conflict at the second round of talks in July. But
fightings have continued over the past months.

<HEADLINE> UK Creates World's First Virtual Autopsy on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Students and staff at Leicester
University, central England, have created the world's first
virtual reality autopsy website.
</P>
<P>
The pioneering development allows medical students to conduct a
virtual post-mortem with the mouse in place of the pathologist's
knife, according to a press release from the university.
</P>
<P>
The final design is based around seven autopsy files with basic
details extracted from departmental records. The images were
obtained from a wide variety of sources and do not come from the
original autopsies.
</P>
<P>
The website, http://www.le.ac.uk/pathology/teach/VA, is being
hailed as a breakthrough in computer-assisted learning for medical
students.
</P>
<P>
"As the hospital autopsy rate has dwindled, the exposure of
medical undergraduates to the post mortems as a valuable teaching
aid has diminished." said Dr Kevin West, a senior lecturer in
Pathology from the university.
</P>
<P>
"However, it is possible to use autopsy files to facilitate
learning without the traditional post-mortem demonstration and
modern information technology allows access to such material," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Dr West added that because the site has open access, whole body
images are not included and thus the voyeur is discouraged.
Students are presented with a clinical hist
 047nd may then view
the autopsy findings by clicking on the appropriate system on a
body outline.
</P>
<P>
There are opportunities to review aspects of the underlying
basic medical science and at any stage the student may propose the
cause of death. If the answer is wrong, further advice is offered.

UNITED NATIONS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic

"The aggressors against the Congo," defying international law
on armed conflicts and international civil aviation, caused the
death of 41 civilians, including women, children and four crew
members, Makonga said.
</P>

He called on the council to condemn the action, secure the
withdrawal of "enemy troops" from Congolese territory, and require
reparation to be made to the Congo state, its people, particularly
the affected families and to the airline.

LUSAKA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland, a tiny south African
country, has arrested 40 people in capital Mbabane and its
neighboring town of Manzini as part of a security operation
before the general elections to be held Friday, a report reaching

</P>
<P>
The report quoted a Swazi police spokesman as saying that most

firearms and ammunition while others were charged with
immigration offenses.
</P>
<P>
He said that the raids on houses in the country's main centers

</P>
<P>
He denied the allegations that operation is aimed at
intimidating political groups calling for a boycott of the
one-party elections and lifting a 25-year-old ban on political

LUANDA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Angolan First Lady Anna Paulo
dos Santos Thursday urged an end to the domestic war and called
on the whole society to help the women in the rural areas in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The first lady made the call at a function celebrating the
World Rural Women's Day on October 15 set by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
As the head of the National Committee for Helping Rural Women,
Mrs. Dos Santos urged that war must stop so that the suffering
women in rural Angola can rebuild their home and restore
production.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the committee which was set up in 1992 is to
seek for peace, raise the status of women and promote the
development in the rural areas of this south African country.
</P>
<P>
Women are the main labor force in both daily life and the
agricultural production, the first lady noted, adding that 90
percent of grain has been produced by them and 60 to 90 percent
of business activities are managed by them.
</P>
<P>
Women have the lowest position in the rural society, having
little opportunities of education. They suffered the most during
the civil war, she said.
</P>
<P>
Emergent programs such as loans for mini farms and education
for women should be designed immediately, the first lady pointed
out.

most of the Antarctic ice sheet is stable, scientists said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An international team of scientists, led by Professor Duncan
Wingham from University College London, UK, have found that on
average the Antarctic ice sheet was changing by less than one
centimeter in thickness each year.
</P>
<P>
The researchers used the European Space Agency's ERS satellites
to determine if the thickness of the Antarctic ice sheet changed
over the five year period from 1992 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
They were able to measure the average height change of 63
percent of the Antarctic ice sheet with an accuracy of 0.5
centimeter each year and found the majority of the ice sheet is in
balance.
</P>
<P>
"These findings make the Antarctic ice sheet look unlikely
source for the sea level rise we have observed this century."
Professor Wingham told a press conference on Thursday in London.
</P>
<P>
Using previous measurements for changes in snowfall over the
ice sheet, scientists concluded that the interior of the Antarctic
ice sheet had contributed only 1.7 centimeter to sea level rise
this century.
</P>
<P>
Sea level this century has risen 18 centimeters over the past
100 years. Previously it had been thought that Antarctica may have
raised or lowered global sea level by 14 centimeters in either
direction.
</P>
<P>
"Scientists have never really understood the role that
Antarctica has played in this century's rising sea level. Our
research makes it likely that the answer is 'very little'," said
Professor Wingham.
</P>
<P>
Th result, to be published Friday in the American journal
Science, supports the view that other sources of sea level rise,
in particular the effect of global warming on thermal expansion of
the ocean, may be larger than people have thought, Professor
Wingham said.

CAIRO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
DOHA -- The Qatari Minister of Energy and Industry Abdulla Bin
Hamad Al-Attiya has said that Qatar has taken measures to
diversify is income to reduce the impact of price fluctuation in
oil market.
</P>
<P>
He said that Qatar's strategy is based on several methods, the
foremost of which is the diversification of income sources through
investment in diverse fields other than petroleum.
</P>
<P>
According to Thursday's Arab daily "Al Hayat," the minister
further stated that the diversification activities are aimed at
increasing revenues.
</P>
<P>
He said during the 1998-2002 five-year plan, some 5 billion
U.S. dollars will be allocated to the petroleum sector, and 6.8
billion dollars to be distributed among the remaining sectors of
petrochemicals, refining and domestic gas.
</P>
<P>
Al-Attiya went on to say that the second method lies in
"raising petroleum productivity."
</P>
<P>
The third is "to avoid investment in high risk activities."
</P>
<P>
He said that a fourth method of Qatar's strategy lies in
"concluding long-term contracts for the export of liquified gas."
</P>
<P>
The minister defined the fifth method as being directed towards
"cutting operation and capital costs."

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Assist Women and Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- African governments were
urged Thursday to ratify and comply with the legislation,
conventions and treaties related to assistance and protection of
conflict-affected women and children.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in the Plan of Action adopted at the
end of a four-day African regional meeting here in Addis Ababa on
enhancing the participation of returnees, refugees and internally
displaced women and children in reconstruction, rehabilitation
and peace building.
</P>
<P>
The document said that in Africa today, there are seven
million refugees and 20 million internally displaced people who
are currently living within the borders of their own countries.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that refugee and internally displaced women
constitute the bulk of the population of any country during
conflict and of the general population after conflict, while
women and children account for about 75 percent of the refugee
and displaced populations.
</P>
<P>
"As long as a significant portion of society's population are
displaced, the conflict has not ended," the paper stressed,
adding that "there can be no hope of normalcy until the majority
of those displaced are able to reintegrate themselves into their
societies."
</P>
<P>
It noted that the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution is
expected to put a halt to the production of refugees and
internally displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
On African women's role in development, the Plan of Action
pointed out that African women dominate agricultural production
in many countries and account for 60-80 percent of the
agricultural labor force in the continent.
</P>
<P>
It added that "to enhance the participation of returnee,
refugee and internally displaced women and children in
reconstruction, rehabilitation and peace building, concrete and
practical strategies need to be adopted."
</P>
<P>
The document stressed that economic empowerment of women must
go hand in hand with women's political empowerment as political
decision-making affects and is affected by economic, social and
cultural issues.
</P>
<P>
It also appealed to OAU member states to set up a Plan of
Action Implementing Committee in each country and create national
mechanisms for implementing decisions.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Survives on Nonconfidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi survived the biggest test during his fifth term of office
vote of nonconfidence in the parliament Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
His ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) got 134 votes
in favor while the opposition managed 67, leaving six absent.
</P>
<P>
KANU takes just 113 parliamentary seats against the combined
opposition's 107. However, KANU has formed an unofficial
alliance with the opposition National Development Party (NDP)
which controls around 20 seats.
</P>
<P>
The vote, the third since Kenya's independence in 1963, came
after four and a half hours debate in the parliament over
opposition lawmaker James Orengo's motion of nonconfidence in the
government.
</P>
<P>
Orengo cited high unemployment rate, worsening poverty, tribal
clashes and embattled economy as a whole behind his motion.
</P>
<P>
Unlike ordinary motions, Orengo's was brought under the
constitution which requires actual voting by all the 221
parliamentary members who hold vote in the House. The Speaker
and the Attorney-General have no vote.
</P>
<P>
If the motion succeeded, the president would have to either
resign or dissolve Parliament within three days.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Moi dismissed the idea of sharing government
with other parties, arguing that if they want a share of power
they should join KANU.

<P>
LAGOS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
launched the Vitamin A food fortification logo in a bid to
enhance the people's health status in the country.

UNITED NATIONS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations on Thursday voted to help the Central Africa
Republic in its upcoming legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
The Council, at the same time, also decided to extend the
mandate of its peacekeeping mission in the country until February
28, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted unanimously, the Council approved the
deployment of 250 peacekeepers to six selected sites for election.
The two rounds of elections will be held on November 22 and
December 13.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA) is
composed of 1,245 troops that took over peacekeeping functions on
April 15, 1998 from an African force which was deployed there
since February 1997 with the Security Council's endorsement. But
it was unable to function beyond mid-April 1998 because France,
which had provided logistical support, withdrew its troops from
the country.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also said MINURCA personnel would be pulled out
of the country no later than February 28, 1999, and asked the U.N.
Secretary-General to begin reducing the number of troops no later
than January 15, 1999.
</P>

The resolution urged the international community to provide the
required technical, financial and logistical assistance for the
elections of the country.

<HEADLINE> Dow Shoots up 300 to Nearly 8300 after Rates Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks shot up in late
trading Thursday, following a surprise interest rates cut by the
Federal Reserve to boost U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average, seeing a 48.66 plunge in the
morning and a upturn of 110 points before the the Fed
announcement, closed 330.58 or 4.1 percent up to 8299.36.
</P>
<P>
The Fed cut the overnight rate on loans between banks, or the
federal funds rate, and the discount rate on its own loans to
banks by a quarter point each, to 5 percent and 4.75 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
It said that cautious lending and "unsettled conditions" in the
financial markets "are likely to be restraining aggregate demand
in the future".
</P>
<P>
"Against this backdrop, further easing of the stance of
monetary policy was judged to be warranted to sustain economic
growth in the context of contained inflation," it said.
</P>
<P>
The move followed a September 29 cut of a quarter point on the
overnight bank rate. The Fed was concerned about the volatile
stock prices in August when Asian financial crisis exerted
contagion effects on global bourses.
</P>
<P>
The Dow saw the third-highest jump in history following a
380.53 points gain on September 8 and a surge of 337.17 points
on October 28, 1997, a day after sinking a record 554.26.
</P>
<P>
The score on Thursday was 4.9 percent above the year's starting
point of 7908.25, but it is still over 1000 or 11.1 percent lower
than the record 9337.97 chalked on July 17.
</P>
<P>
Broader market indicators were also up, with the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index up 70.04 to 1611.01, the
Standard &AMP; Poor' 500 up 41.97 to 1047.50, the New York Stock
Exchange composite index up 19.48 to 516.46 and the American Stock
Exchange composite index up 15.65 to 598.66.

<HEADLINE> U.S. White House, Congress Reach Deal on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced the White House reached a deal with Congress Thursday
on a 500 billion U.S. dollar budget package after ironing out
differences over some major issues of education and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich said he expected a vote on
the final compromise late tonight or Friday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton conceded that his proposal for modernizing school
buildings with 5 billion dollars in targeted tax breaks had been
dropped in the budget negotiations. He said he would push for it
again next year.
</P>
<P>
Some of the more serious disagreements that were not resolved
until the end concerned the 2000 census, family planning and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
A fourth temporary spending bill had to be passed Wednesday,
this one running through Friday, to keep government agencies open
while negotiations continued on the big budget bill.
</P>
<P>
Republicans agreed to a Democratic plan announced by Clinton in
his State of the Union address in February to provide 1.1 billion
dollars to hire 100,000 new elementary school teachers. The
measure gives local communities the funds to recruit, hire and
train teachers.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration got 18 billion dollars to replenish
International Monetary Fund (IMF) resources, but with the GOP
conditions that the IMF take steps to make its operations more
open and effective.
</P>
<P>
Details also were being worked out on a near 20 billion dollars
emergency spending package that included the agriculture aid,
money for disaster victims, peacekeeping in Bosnia, the year 2000
computer problem and, at the urging of Republicans, 9.7 billion
dollars for military readiness, a national defense system and
intelligence.

<HEADLINE> Electrical Brain Stimulation Helps Parkinson's Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Electrical stimulation of
the brain can greatly improve the ability of Parkinson's disease
patients to perform everyday tasks, said a study published in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
French researchers found, in a study involving 24 patients
aged 48 to 64, with electrical stimulation to a part of the
brain called the subthalamic nucleus, patients saw a 60 percent
improvement in their motor skills and ability to perform daily
tasks when the medication was not working.
</P>
<P>
When receiving medical treatment, electrical stimulation
improved symptoms slightly and helped decrease the jerky
movements that are a side effect of drug levodopa. The average
dosage of levedopa may be cut in half, and other drugs were also
reduced or eliminated.

<HEADLINE> Report: Starr and His Contacts under Scrutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Independent counsel Kenneth
Starr is fighting renewed criticism of his past contacts with
Paula Jones' lawyers as the White House and its congressional
allies try to raise issues in the impeachment inquiry of U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Several conversations between Starr and Jones lawyer Gilbert
Davis in 1994, before Starr was appointed independent counsel to
investigate Clinton, have been added to the questions about the
prosecutor's conduct already under review by the Justice
Department as well as by Democrats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
"The revelation of these discussions between Mr. Starr and the
Jones attorneys raises several serious questions," Jim Kennedy, a
special adviser to White House counsel Charles Ruff, was quoted as
saying by the Associated Press on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jones accused Clinton in a now-dismissed federal lawsuit of
propositioning her in a Little Rock, Arkansas, hotel room in 1991,
when he was governor and she a state employee. Clinton denies the
allegation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's private attorney, David Kendall, and news
organizations have raised a variety of other issues about the way
Starr's office conducted the Monica Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
"As always, when allegations come in, we take a look at them,"
the AP report quoted an unidentified senior Justice Department
official as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Davis said he called Starr, then a private lawyer, as many as a
half-dozen times to seek his guidance on the constitutional
question of whether a sitting president is immune from lawsuits.
Starr's view was that the president was not.
</P>
<P>
The discussions were first revealed in January on CNBC's
"Rivera Live." National Public Radio focused new attention on the
contacts Wednesday, prompting Starr's office to issue a statement
in response.
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether Starr should have reported his talks with
Davis when the prosecutor sought authority from Attorney General
Janet Reno in January to expand his Whitewater criminal
investigation to the Lewinsky affair, based on an allegation that
Clinton friend Vernon Jordan was trying to find the former White
House intern a job in return for her perjured testimony.
</P>
<P>
"This office did not mislead the Department of Justice
regarding relevant facts relating to its jurisdiction, or any
expansion," the independent counsel's statement said.
</P>
<P>
In an ABC-TV interview Thursday, Reno declined to comment on
whether Starr had acted properly, saying only that "we are
reviewing all the issues at this point."
</P>
<P>
Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat and member of the
House Judiciary Committee, said the impeachment inquiry, the
Justice Department review and congressional oversight hearings all
are proper avenues for delving into Starr's conduct.
</P>
<P>
"He wired Linda Tripp before he had jurisdiction, he bullied
Monica Lewinsky, he may have set up perjury traps for the
president," said Nadler.
</P>
<P>
"Starr deserves an investigation of his own, maybe in the
context of oversight hearings next year" in the reauthorization of
the independent counsel law, said Nadler.
</P>
<P>
Justice Department officials believe that the attorney
general's only disciplinary authority over Starr is the power to
fire him for what the law describes as "good cause... or any other
condition that substantially impairs the performance of such
independent counsel's duties."
</P>
<P>
In addition, several other matters relating to Starr's inquiry
are under review at the Justice Department.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. policy-makers of
the Federal Reserve Thursday cut short-term interest rates for the
second time in less than a month.
</P>
<P>
The Fed cut two key short-term interest rates by a quarter
percentage point this afternoon, citing "growing caution by
lenders and unsettled conditions in financial markets."
</P>
<P>
It cut the federal funds overnight bank lending rate to 5
percent from 5.25 percent. It also cut the discount rate to 4.75
percent from 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Growing caution by lenders and unsettled conditions in
financial markets more generally are likely to be restraining
aggregate demand in the future," the Fed said in a statement.
"Against this backdrop, further easing of the stance of monetary
policy was judged to be warranted to sustain economic growth in
the context of contained inflation. "
</P>
<P>
The Fed reduced the overnight interest rate between banks by
0.25 percent on September 29, but left the discount rate
unchanged. The panel is scheduled to hold another meeting on
November 17 for possible reduction.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Belgrade not Complying with NATO Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday that Yugoslavia was still not in compliance with the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) demands aimed at
averting air strikes over the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and NATO's supreme allied
commander, Wes Clark, would deliver that message to Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic in a meeting in Belgrade, said White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic faces a Saturday deadline to show substantial
progress toward withdrawing Serb forces from Kosovo to avoid NATO
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously there's a range of things that need to be done to
come into compliance," Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said Yugoslavia had begun to allow humanitarian agencies
into Kosovo to begin relieving the plight of hundreds of thousands
of ethnic Albanians displaced by a Serb offensive.
</P>
<P>
"But I don't think there's anyone who believes he has come into
compliance. The message that will be delivered today is we need to
see substantial progress by the deadline," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed by U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke and Milosevic, Yugoslavia should withdraw its troops from
Kosovo under the monitoring of NATO and the Organization of
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).

<HEADLINE> Iraq Refuses to Hand Out Document Wanted by U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq would not hand over
a document U.N. arms inspectors wanted until U.N. conducted a
comprehensive review of its sanctions against Iraq, Iraq's U.N.
Envoy Nizar Hamdoon said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Hamdoon was called in by President of the United
Nations Security Council Jeremy Greenstock this afternoon to
explain the delay in handing over the document that allegedly
shows how many munition capable of being filled with chemical or
biological agents Iraq expended during its war with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Greenstock, Hamdoon
said that Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz had brought the
document with him to New York early in October in case a review
was held.
</P>
<P>
"We do not regard this document as relevant to the work of the
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), " said Hamdoon, adding
"In the context of the comprehensive review, this document could
be used in a way that would help to clarify that matter."
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon said the original version of the document was put under
seal for a later date and another stage of the disarmament
process.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Kosovo Air Monitoring Begin Quickly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) will fly its unarmed spy warplanes over Kosovo
as early as Friday to monitor an agreement aimed at ending
violence there, the Pentagon said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It's conceivable that the first mission could start as early
as tomorrow. If not tomorrow, then very shortly thereafter,"
Defense Department spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters.
</P>
<P>
U.S., British, French, German, Dutch and Russian planes are
likely to participate in the spy flights, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The air verification mission will include participants from a
number of countries, probably including Russia, although I'm not
sure that the full details have been worked out yet," he said.
</P>
<P>
Unarmed American U-2s, French Mirages, German Tornadoes,
British Canberras, Dutch P-3 Orions and a number of unmanned U.S.
"Predator" aerial drones could take part in the missions,
according to Bacon.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not know what types of Russian planes might take
part. Russia is not a member of NATO, but has offered to help with
the surveillance missions.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia had not yet complied with U.N. demands to pull out
forces from Kosovo and allow thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees
to return to their homes in the embattled province and receive
humanitarian aid, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"We have not seen significant withdrawals yet... They (Serbs)
have begun to comply, but they are far from full compliance," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said an air verification agreement to the overall
agreement by Milosevic made clear that Serbian anti-aircraft
defenses must not threaten the unarmed spy planes.
</P>
<P>
NATO will deploy its forces in Hungary to protect the
monitoring mission and spy planes.
