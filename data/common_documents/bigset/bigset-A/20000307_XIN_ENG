<HEADLINE> Prince Ranariddh Welcomes Female PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's National Assembly
President Prince Norodom Ranariddh said Monday that he is not
against Cambodia having a female prime minister in next general
election which is scheduled in year 2003.
</P>
<P>
"I want to see Cambodian women to be equal as men, and I wish
to see and support a Cambodian woman to be a prime minister," the
prince told dozens of women who paid a courtesy call to him on the
occasion of the International Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh also said Cambodian women can follow the examples of
Bangladesh and Britain where women have become prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian women represent over 52 percent of the total
population and a remarkable force in the country, as they control
85 percent of small enterprises in urban areas, constitute 60
percent of the agricultural work force and head 25 to 30 percent
of all rural households. However, they still face constraints in
all spheres of life.
</P>
<P>
At present, Cambodia has only two women ministers, four
secretaries of state, and five undersecretaries of state in the
executive body which has 24 ministries and two state secretariats,
while in the National Assembly, there are only 12 female members
out of 122, and eight out of 62 in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Women's and Veterans' Affairs (MWVA) launched a
five-year plan entitled "Neary Rattank" (Women are Precious Gems)
on March 8, 1999, aimed at promoting the status of women and
bringing women into the decision-making process at all levels.
</P>
<P>
Mu Sochua, minister of MWVA, told reporters that she will try
her best to encourage women to take more active roles in the
government to reach a minimum standard of at least 30 percent in
the whole society.

<HEADLINE> Nepali FM Denies Security Deal With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Foreign Minister Ram
Sharan Mahat Monday denied the news report that Nepal had agreed
to allow the presence of Indian security personnel at Tribhuvan
International Airport (TIA) in Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions at the Parliament, Mahat made it clear
that the Nepali government had given no approval on presence of
Indian security personnel at TIA.
</P>
<P>
"The news report is false and has no truth at all," he told the
MPs.
</P>
<P>
It is the responsibility of the government to provide security
at the Nepalese airport and Nepal is quite competent to provide
such a securtiy, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"His Majesty's government is determined to provide security in
keeping with international air safety standard at TIA," Mahat said,
adding that the existing security arrangement at the airport would
be improved according to the needs of time.
</P>
<P>
The French News Agency (AFP) Saturday quoted Indian Minister of
State for Civil Aviation Chaman Lal Gupta as saying that "Nepal
had admitted of security lapses at its international airport and
had agreed in principle to allow Indian security at the TIA."
</P>
<P>
After an Indian Airlines passenger plane was hijacked on route
from Kathmandu to New Delhi on December 24, 1999, India has
suspended its flights here on security reasons and suggested
posting security personnel at TIA, which was rejected by the
Nepali government.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Attacks U.N. For Delaying Khmer Rouge Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen Monday attacked the United Nations for intentionally delaying
the trial of former Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
"If you want to play a trick of delaying the trial with me,
please do it. I will not take the Khmer Rouge issue seriously
anymore," Hun Sen warned when taking part in rice harvest in the
eastern province of Prey Veng.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister emphasized that "whatever you (the U.N.)
want to do (to try or not to try the Khmer Rouge), I will do my
economic construction. I do not want to spend a lot of time on the
issue." Hun Sen also warned that the delay would result in the
death of some old Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
His talk, broadcast by local radios and televisions, was
apparently referring to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to whom
he had sent a letter and who has promised to send a legal team to
Cambodia for further discussions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and Cambodian government are still at odds on who will
dominate the trial proceedings. The government approved a draft
law on the issue on January 14, and forwarded it to the National
Assembly for approval.
</P>
<P>
"You must remember that Cambodia is a sovereignty country and
also the member of the United Nations. We have a legal government,
so our country's issue should be resolved by ourselves," Hun Sen
stressed.

BANGKOK, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand (BOT) will
include all troubled firms in the country into the government's
debt restructuring program by the end of 2000, a senior BOT
official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yodchai Choosri, BOT senior director for the promotion of debt
restructuring, was quoted by Thailand News Agency as saying that
the central bank is pushing for a big-step progress in the debt
restructuring program and is planning to bring all troubled firms
into the official program by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will consult with local commercial banks on
how to realize their target in debt reforms, he added.
</P>
<P>
Law amendments will also be continued to facilitate the program,
said Yodchai.
</P>
<P>
Local commercial banks have reportedly set a general target of
carrying out no less than 15,000 debt restructuring cases a month,
but progress has been slow due to failed negotiations between
banks and their troubled clients.

<HEADLINE> World AIDS Campaign Launched in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Asia's first World AIDS campaign,
which highlights the need to change social attitudes toward the
fatal disease and make men more responsible in their sexual
behavior, was launched in India on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, with a theme of "Men Make A Difference," aims to
raise awareness on the relationship between men's sexual behavior
and the spread of AIDS, and to encourage people to talk about sex
and gender issues to remove prejudice and ignorance, said Peter
Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, who is here to promote the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Piot said that more than two decades after the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) surfaced, focus has for the first
time shifted to men's role in the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Irresponsible sexual behavior of men put both men and women at
risk, he stressed, adding that men should be made aware of their
role as fathers and the potential impact of their behavior on both
their spouses and children.
</P>
<P>
Indian Health Minister N T Shanmugam pointed to the fact that
the AIDS epidemic is continuing to evolve in an atmosphere of fear,
stigma and discrimination. In 1999 alone, he said, nearly 5.6
million people, or over 15,000 a day, became infected with HIV
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
He agreed that the spread of AIDS has highlighted the need for
behavior change in both individuals and societies, particularly
among men.

Shekhar Kumar Niraj, Regional Director of Wildlife Preservation
of the South and Western Region, said Monday that they have busted
an international gang with the arrest of two persons involved in
exporting these creatures to the Gulf via Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that some 1,000 to 1,500 birds died because

<P>
The rest of the birds were rescued and were now kept in special
cages at Jijamata Ydyan Zoo in Bombay, according to the Press
Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
Niraj disclosed that a consignment of these birds was being
sent through Pakistan Airways Flight (PK-821) in cages covered
with jute to Pakistan from where they were to be exported via
Dubai to Sharjah, the main international market of these creatures.
</P>
<P>
Interrogation revealed that such illegal exports had been going
on for quite some time. These rare birds were caught from jungles
of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Karnataka by poaches who brought them
to Bombay.

<HEADLINE> Repatriation Conference Held in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam had received more than 112,
000 of its refugees from abroad under the Comprehensive Program of
Action (CPA) launched in March 1989 and basically completed in
November 1997.
</P>
<P>
The figure was given at a conference to review a decade of
receiving and re-integrating Vietnamese returnees into the
community, which opened in Vietnam's Ha Long City of Quang Ninh
province, some 150 km northeast of Hanoi, Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the conference, Vietnam's Minister of Labor, War
Invalids and Social Affairs Nguyen Thi Hang and Regional Chief
Representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) Jahanshah Assadi noted that tens of thousands of
Vietnamese illegally left the country by sea in the late 1980s as
a result of heavy war aftermath, poverty caused by natural
calamities and mis-information about a good life overseas, Vietnam
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Their departure did harm not only to their lives but also to
the country's social order and security and relations with other
nations,the officials said.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 million U.S. dollars had been poured into 1,440
minor projects of different kinds in all 61 cities and provinces
throughout the country, it was learnt at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60,000 loans were disbursed to help the Vietnamese
returnees to run business or production operations while millions
of US dollars was spent on education, training and healthcare
services.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the conference, however, acknowledged that
between 15 and 20 percent of the Vietnamese returnees still meet
with difficulties in their daily life, particularly those in flood-
prone central provinces.
</P>
<P>
They hence called for continued cooperation in appropriate
forms from the UNHCR, international organizations and foreign
governments to prevent possible unusual emigration.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pledges to Assist Mozambique in Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States pledged to
support Mozambique's reconstruction efforts in the wake of the
country's worst flood in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
U.S. ambassador to Mozambique Brian Curran said here Monday at
a press conference in Maputo, that the aids depend on the figure
the Mozambican government asks for after a final assessment of the
devastation,
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has granted 12.8 million U.S. dollars for
the victims of the flooding in southern and central part of
Mozambique so far.
</P>
<P>
Curran said as an initial show of generosity the U.S. is "ready
to cancel Mozambique's bilateral debt". However, he played down
the gesture, saying that the debt was minimal because it only
amounts to five million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Curran suggested to shift from rescue operations to relief as
the water level is receding.
</P>
<P>
Although Cyclone Gloria, currently in the Mozambique Channel,
had been downgraded to a tropical depression, prudence indicated
that "we remain in a state of alert", and consequently it would be
necessary to have more relief workers in place, he said.
</P>
<P>
A contingent of American marines will arrive on Tuesday in
Maputo and remain in the country for three to four weeks, Curran
said.
</P>
<P>
The marines will bring along six more helicopters and
fixed-wing airplanes, he added.
</P>
<P>
The 700 to 900 U.S. soldiers will be deployed in Maputo and
central port city of Beira as well as in the Hoedespruit air base
in South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Outgoing Syrian FM Meets Turkish Deputy FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Faruk Shareh, foreign minister of
the just-resigned Syrian cabinet, met here Tuesday with Turkish
Deputy Foreign Minister Ugor Zial on water issues and bilateral
ties, the Arab Syrian News Agency (ASNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Zial had held talks with his Syrian
counterpart Sulayman Haddad on water, security and trade issues.
Turkey used to oppose any talks on the water issue with Syria.
Under an accord signed in 1987 on the water issue, Turkey allows
500 cubic meters of Euphrates River to flow into Syria per second.
</P>
<P>
 Syria and Iraq have both protested against Turkish plans to
dam the Euphrates and Tigris in a vast irrigation project. A
reduced Tigris flow will go directly into Iraq, the diminished
Euphrates must supply Syria as well before reaching Iraq.
</P>
<P>
ASNA quoted sources of Turkey's embassy here as saying that the
talks may lead to a meeting between the foreign ministers of the
two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Zial and his delegation would discuss with Syrian leaders the
possibility of reaching a declaration of principles on the Syrian-
Turkish economic, political and cultural relations, the sources
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman has said recently that
Zial's visit aimed to improve ties between the two neighbors that
worsened two years ago with Turkey accusing Syria of supporting the
Turkish-banned Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) seeking to establish an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, and threatening
military action if the support continued.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was only defused after the two countries signed an
agreement in the Turkish town of Adana in October 1998, in which
Syria reiterated the PKK is an illegal party and it would not
receive any type of support from Damascus.
</P>
<P>
The strong military threat also led to the deportation of PKK
leader Abdullah Ocalan from his Syrian hideout and his eventual
arrest in Kenya in February last year.
</P>
<P>
The water issue, according to the Turkish sources, could serve
as a bridge for enhancing cooperation between Turkey and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish delegation arrived here Monday evening on a three
day visit to Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian cabinet under former prime minister Mahmoud Zouebi
resigned Tuesday and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad has named a
new prime minister. The caretaker government will continue to work
until a new cabinet is formed.

DAMASCUS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad on
Tuesday accepted the resignation of the government of Prime

<P>
Mohammed Mustafa Miro, who is currently governor of the second

As early as in March 1999 when Assad won election to a fifth

reshuffle in the country so fresh blood might be injected into the

<HEADLINE> Depleted Uranium Responsible for Iraq's Cancer: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The radioactivity from the depleted
uranium bombs used by the U.S. and British forces during the 1991
Gulf War was the main cause for the increase of Iraq's cancer
patients, an Iraqi official said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's cancer cases reached 4,341 in 1991, but the number rose
to 6,158 in 1997, and the depleted uranium has been found
responsible for the increase, said Abul-Hadi Al-Khalili, deputy
head of the Iraqi Cancer Board, while addressing a conference to
seek ways to fight the soaring cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi authorities have condemned the U.S.-led Western allies
for dropping hundreds of tons of depleted uranium bombs in the
south and other parts of Iraq and causing harm to the health of the
Iraqi people and contaminating the environment.
</P>
<P>
According to Khalili, there are more cancer patients, especially
leukemia or blood cancer patients, in southern Iraq because most of
the depleted uranium bombs were dropped there during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
There are about tens of thousands of registered cancer patients
in Iraq, but the actual number may be much higher, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq can do little to help the victims of the depleted
uranium bombs, as it is short of medical equipments to investigate
the disease, short of medicine and anesthetic drugs, he added.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the U.S. and Britain of
deteriorating the humanitarian crisis in Iraq by deliberately
blocking the contracts Iraq signed with foreign companies to buy
food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to sell limited
amount of oil and use part of the revenue to offset the impact of
the sweeping U.N. sanctions since Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the Iraqi health ministry
recently, as many as 1.28 million Iraqi people have died as a
direct result of the decade-long sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President: German FM's Visit to Iran Preludes Better Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer's just-concluded visit to Iran can be a good prelude to
better bilateral relations, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami said
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, Khatami expressed pleasure with his talks earlier in the
day with Fischer, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Fischer left the Iranian capital late Tuesday after concluding
his two-day official visit, which was aimed at mending fences and
making arrangements for Khatami's visit to Germany in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting between Fischer and his Iranian counterpart Kamal
Kharrazi, the two officials expressed their willingness to remove
obstacles to improvement of relations.
</P>
<P>
Having gone through tough periods in their relations, Tehran and
Berlin can now create a new atmosphere conducive to joint efforts
to serve the interests of the two countries, Kharrazi was quoted by
IRNA as saying after the talks.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that in light of talks between Iranian and
German officials and arrangements made for Khatami's visit to
Germany, a new chapter will be opened in bilateral ties and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the biggest importer of non-oil commodities from Iran
and one of Iran's major trading partners.
</P>
<P>
The traditional close commercial relations between the two
countries have been strained for a period of time due to incidents
including the arrest and imprisonment of a German businessman and a
Berlin court's ruling that Tehran had ordered the slaying of three
Kurdish dissident leaders and their translator in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Now the time of lack of coordination in bilateral relations is
over and German officials are hopeful of new ties with Iran,
Fischer said after his talks with Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
He stressed Berlin is interested in more cooperation and
understanding with Iran. The German government and people are eager
to welcome President Khatami to visit Germany in the near future,
Fischer added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls for World Support to End Conflicts in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- It is an ongoing process to
promote peace and development in Africa, home to most of the world
's intra-state conflicts, and a success story in this regard
requires "the sustained support and commitment of the entire
international community," a U.N. leader said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Theo-Ben Gurirab, president of the 54th General Assembly
session and Namibian foreign minister, made the statement at the
opening of the first session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the
Causes of Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and
Sustainable Development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We must strive to maintain the momentum and ensure that the
central issues become matters of deep concern that call for action
by the United Nations and the international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The imperative need to treat the political and economic
dimensions of the report will underscore the point that peace and
development are closely linked and must be tackled together
throughout," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in his report to the
Security Council and the General Assembly in April 1998, shed
light on the causes of conflicts and the promotion of durable
peace and sustainable development on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Under a resolution adopted by the General Assembly in 1999,
the Ad Hoc Working Group was set up to monitor the implementation
of recommendations contained in Annan's report and put forward by
the U.N. Economic and Social Council.
</P>
<P>
"These proposals deal with the coordination of the policies
and activities of the specialized agencies and other bodies of the
United Nations system," he said."In essence, the said proposals
emphasized the theme: 'Development of Africa: implementation and
coordination follow-up by the United Nations system of initiatives
on African development."
</P>
<P>
He voiced his belief that the Working Group will best serve
the purpose by mainly concentrating on the following four topics.
They include poverty eradication, refugee crisis, debt
cancellation and financing for development.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Court Reserves Judgement in Ex-President Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 7 (Xinhua) (C Zimbabwe's Supreme Court on Tuesday
reserved its judgement on charges against former President Canaan
Banana on 11 counts of sexual offences.
</P>
<P>
Banana was convicted by the High Court on January 18 last year
and sentenced to 12 months imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Phillip Muziri of the Attorney General's Office said there had
been ample evidence before the court to sustain both conviction
and sentence.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Banana's conduct in this matter was of highly unusual
and striking nature that it cannot simply be brushed aside on the
basis of coincidence, accident or collaboration."
</P>
<P>
He argued that Banana deserved a prison sentence for having
shown a total disregard of responsibility and a gross abuse of
power.
</P>
<P>
He urged the court to send a clear signal that should anyone
conduct themselves in a similar manner it would not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
Defence counsel Advocate Chris Andersen said Banana should be
acquitted for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
 Banana was Zimbabwean President from April, 1980 to December,
 1987.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Transportation Minister Takes Leave on harassment Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Transportation Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai announced Tuesday he will take a leave from his
post, but refused to resign on charges of sexual molestation and
attempted rape.
</P>
<P>
A criminal investigation into the charges has been launched,
Israel Radio reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some cabinet ministers have earlier urged him to step down, at
least temporarily. It is believed that Mordechai had consulted with
Prime Minister Ehud Barak about his leave decision.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reports said earlier in the day that Mordechai
called one of his staff members, a 23-year-old woman, to his office
at a night 10 days ago. Then he advanced her, forced her to ground
and began to remove her clothes, which was only stopped after the
woman burst out crying.
</P>
<P>
Outright denying the charges, Mordechai said at a news
conference Tuesday afternoon that said he wanted to tell the people
of Israel that "everything said against me today is not true, and
there is absolutely no truth in the allegations."
</P>
<P>
The charges of sexual misconduct are very serious, both
criminally and politically, and something contradictory to his
whole ethic world, personal value systems and everything he had
believed in, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said he decided to have a leave of absence, though, in
order to enable the police to conduct a "quiet" probe into the
matter, which he hoped would be carried out swiftly to uncover the
truth.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai promised he will cooperate fully with the policemen in
the inquiry, and tell the whole truth and nothing but truth about
the events. But at this point, he would not say any more publicly
to avoid influencing the probe negatively.
</P>
<P>
He concluded his emotional speech with saying that it was a
difficult day for him, his wife and his whole family.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Settler Who Killed Palestinian Gains Early Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A Jewish settler who was given
life sentence seven years ago for killing a Palestinian has gained
a early release after three times' of prison term cut.
</P>
<P>
Yoram Skolnik will be freed next month after a parole board on
Monday announced the latest four-year jail term reduction and
agreed to grant the Jewish settler a early release, the Israeli
Prison Authority (IPA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The three-member Ma'asiyahu Prison Parole Board said Skolnik has
expressed to the board regret for shooting dead the 20-year-old
Mussa Abu Sabha in March, 1993.
</P>
<P>
"We are deciding to release Yoram Skolnik early on licence and
on the additional condition that he signs in at a police station
twice a month," the IPA said in a statement, which cited
Skolnik's "good behaviour" in the jail.
</P>
<P>
Skolnik, now 31, had told the police investigators during his
trial that Mussa deserved the death and the Palestinians have to be
killed.
</P>
<P>
Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein opposed Skolnik's early
release, warning that it could trigger similar actions in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman first commuted Skolnik's sentence
to 15 years in October 1997, and his jail term was then reduced to
11 years in February 1999.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Takes Leave on Sexual Harassment Allegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Transportation Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai announced Tuesday that he would take a leave from
his post, a move taken following sexual misconduct allegations and
related police investigation.
</P>
<P>
Terming all the allegations as false and groundless, Mordechai
said at a emotional news conference that he refused to resign and
wanted to tell the people of Israel that "everything said against
me today is not true, and there is absolutely no truth in the
allegations," Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The alleged incident dominated the news in Israel a day
before International Women's Day, which said that Mordechai called
one of his staff members, a 23-year-old woman, to his office a
night 10 days ago. Then he advanced her, forced her to ground and
began to remove her clothes, which was only stopped after the woman
burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
The woman later sobbed out the event to several Knesset
(parliament) members and civil service commissioners. She was then
turned to State Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein, who
immediately ordered a police investigation.
</P>
<P>
Police questioned the woman with a lie-detector exam, which
indicated she was telling the truth. The probe team, headed by
Yossi Sedbon, commander of the Police Investigations Unit, will
begin collecting evidence on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, 55, a member of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's security
cabinet, said the charges of sexual molestation and attempted rape
are very serious both criminally and politically, and are something
contradictory to his whole ethic world, personal value systems and
everything he had believed in.
</P>
<P>
But he added that he decided, however, to take a leave of
absence until the end of the police probe so as to enable the
police to conduct a "quiet" investigation swiftly to uncover the
truth.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, also head of the six-seat Center Party in Barak's
ruling coalition, promised he will cooperate fully with the police
in the inquiry, and tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth
about the events.
</P>
<P>
But at this point, he would not say any more publicly to avoid
influencing the probe negatively, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai had said earlier that he did not want to respond to
such a "silly" matter. His wife also stated that she believed her
husband was "just not that type of person."
</P>
<P>
Officials in Barak's office said that Barak was informed of the
investigation only on Tuesday morning and he would respond at a
later stage.
</P>
<P>
The officials also clarified that a meeting between Barak and
Mordechai on Monday night had no relation with the allegations and
was dealing with other matters.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it is widely believed that Mordechai made the
decision to step down temporarily after consulting with Barak, who
was under great pressure from some cabinet ministers urging for a
suspension of Mordechai's duty at once.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami called on Mordechai to
take a leave of absence while waiting for the outcome of the
investigation. Ben-Ami said such a voluntary break would not be an
indication of guilt.
</P>
<P>
Construction and Housing Minister Yitzhak Levy, who is also
chairman of the National Religious Party, warned that if Barak did
not remove Mordechai, his party might support any no-confidence
motion against the government on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who is challenging
Mordechai's leadership in the Center Party, also urged Mordechai to
step down as party leader.
</P>
<P>
Knesset member and famous women activist Yael Dayan, from
Barak's One Israel coalition, also condemned the alleged actions of
Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
If Mordechai is convicted of sexual harassment and attempted
rape and resigns, his post will be taken over by his fellow member
in the Center Party.
</P>
<P>
Dan Meridor, currently Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee chairman, and Knesset member Roni Milo will be the two
most hopeful candidates.
</P>
<P>
A former major general of Israel Defense Forces, Mordechai
joined the Likud party in the 1996 general elections and became the
defense minister in former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
government from 1996 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, Mordechai, widely considered a moderate in the right-
wing government, was at odds with Netanyahu over a number of
issues, especially the peace process with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In the May 1999 elections, Mordechai defected to the Center
Party and ran for premiership himself. He announced to quit the
race at the last minute, which helped Barak defeat Netanyahu in the
first round by a large margin. He and his Center Party later joined
Barak's ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts are worrying that at such a critical moment in the
Israeli-Arab peace process, any instability in the split Barak
government might lead to a real political earthquake in Israel.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that three of Barak's coalition partners, the
orthodox religious Shas party, the National Religious Party and the
Yisrael Ba'aliya party, had already voted against the government in
the Knesset several times.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King in Turkey to Cement Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- King Abdullah Bin Hussein of Jordan
began his first official visit to Turkey Tuesday to boost ties
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The king was accompanied by his wife Rania, Prime Minister Abdel
Rauf Rawabdeh and a number of cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the welcome ceremony, Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel hailed the historical ties between Turkey and Jordan, and
Jordan's efforts to help establish peace and stability in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said King Abdullah has proved his ability to
successfully serve his country and the region after taking over the
throne.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is determined to work together and be in close
cooperation with Jordan for the establishment of peace in the
Middle East and for the construction of the common future in our
region," he added.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah expressed the hope that his visit will mark the
beginning of high-level contacts between officials of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his two-day visit he will exchange views
with Jordanian officials about the improvement of the bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Present at the ceremony on the Turkish side were Demirel's wife
Nazmiye Demirel, Grand National Assembly (parliament) Speaker
Yildirim Akbulut as well as other high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
Following the ceremony, Demirel and Abdullah started a private
meeting after which the two leaders would chair the inter-
delegation meetings between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Demirel and Abdullah are expected to discuss various issues,
including the Middle East peace process, water and trade.
</P>
<P>
In view of Israel's declaration that it will withdraw from south
Lebanon by July, the two leaders are likely to discuss ways to help
bolster the stalled talks on the Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-
Palestinian fronts.
</P>
<P>
Another important topic will be the water issue.
</P>
<P>
Turkey wants to sell water from its Manavgat River to Israel,
Jordan and the Palestinian areas in the first stage of a water
exportation project.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Water Minister Kamel Mahadin, who is among the king's
entourage, paid a visit to Turkey last January during which he
toured the Manavgat water facilities.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah is scheduled to spend the second day of his visit
in Turkey's largest city of Istanbul on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Turkey have enjoyed close relations for years. Late
Jordanian King Hussein, Abdullah's father, was one of Turkey's
leading friends in the Arab world, where Turkey's pro-Israel policy
was widely criticized.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Barak to Meet late Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
will meet late Tuesday to try to reopen peace negotiations between
the two sides, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Arafat's deputy Mahmoud
Abbas will also attend the meeting, the radio quoted senior Israeli
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, which will be held in a secret location,
Barak will put forward certain proposals in an attempt to persuade
the Palestinians to return to the negotiation table, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The proposals will include a further release of Palestinian
prisoners, the opening of a second "safe passage" route linking the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip and the payment of hundreds of
millions of dollars Israel owned the Palestinians in taxes and
duties.
</P>
<P>
The last meeting between the two leaders was held on February 3
at the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip. Arafat
walked out from the meeting as Barak refused to agree to transfer
the Palestinian villages around Jerusalem in the next land
handover.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Arafat gave a strong indication that he will declare
an independent Palestinian state in 2000.
</P>
<P>
He told the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) in West Bank
city of Ramallah that he will declare an independent Palestinian
state in 2000, with or without a peace agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"I declare that there is no turning back on our decision to
declaring national independence within the time ceiling that was
set by the agreements and I declare that the year 2000 is the year
for the Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital," Arafat
said. Arafat made the pledge also hours before United States
Middle East peace envoy Denis Ross was due back in the region to
try to revitalize the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on a final peace deal the two
sides would try to strike by September 13 broke down in February
due to differences over Israel's third transfer of another 6.1
percent of the West Bank territories to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister's Office made no comment on Arafat's
speech, in which he blamed Israel for the present impasse and
called for international intervention to secure a deal.
</P>
<P>
"This is the time of truth. The Israeli government should decide
and put an end to the policy of procrastination, time-wasting and
imposing dictates," Arafat added.
</P>
<P>
Barak acknowledged on Monday there are significant gaps with the
Palestinians on the nature of an agreement but said he believes the
conflict can be resolved through talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat bowed to strong Arab and international pressure last May
not to proceed with a unilateral declaration of an independent
state, fearing such a move can influence the Israeli election,
which brought Barak to power.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians have repeatedly expressed disappointment
with Barak over his procrastination and failure in implementing
signed agreements.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Announces First Buyback of Debt in 70 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Treasury Department on
Thursday will buy back a part of the national debt for the first
time in 70 years, Clinton administration officials announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The initial repurchase operation will cover only 1 billion U.S.
dollars and will be limited to 30-year bonds issued between 1985
and 1990. Treasury officials said they kept the initial operation
small in an effort to test the market response.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers had announced in January
that the government hopes to buy back up to 30 billion dollars of
the 5.7-trillion-dollar national debt this year. The
administration's budget projects that the entire 3.7 trillion
dollars of the national debt that is held by the public could be
wiped out by 2013 under current projections for budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury had said in January that no debt had been bought
by the government for at least a century. But further research
found a limited buyback as recently as 1930.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the government enjoyed its first budget surplus in 29
years and the 1999 surplus marked the first time since Dwight
Eisenhower was president in the 1950s that the government had been
able to post back-to-back annual surpluses.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, which counts elimination of soaring
budget deficits as one of its greatest achievements, has argued
that the most responsible thing to do with the surpluses is to
reduce the national debt, putting the government on a sounder
footing to deal with rising costs when the baby boom generation
begins retiring in a few years.

<HEADLINE> Swiss People to Vote on Initiative to Ban Medically-Assisted Procreation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Swiss people will vote on an
initiative to ban all medically-assisted procreation and sperm
donation on March 12, according to Swiss Radio International.
</P>
<P>
The initiative "for procreation which respects human dignity"
claims to stop all methods that might be "against nature".
</P>
<P>
Opponents of medically-assisted procreation believe that once
fertilization of a woman's egg takes place, life exists, and add
that any treatment which is not guaranteed to be successful,
therefore risks taking a human life.
</P>
<P>
But statistics indicate that many couples have successfully had
children through in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. Worldwide,
more than 600,000 babies have been born as a result of medically-
assisted procreation.
</P>
<P>
On average, two such babies are born in Switzerland every day,
said Swiss Radio International. With one in every six couples
infertile in Switzerland, the statistics show there is a demand
for such treatment.
</P>
<P>
The radio report said that the referendum is unlikely to be
adopted because it has been rejected by the government, parliament
and all major parties.
</P>
<P>
After all, 100,000 couples are unable to conceive in
Switzerland, and it is likely many will pin their hopes on
alternatives to natural procreation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Aide in Belfast Amid Fresh Moves to Break Deadlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
deputy national security adviser, James Steinberg, flew into
Belfast on Tuesday amid fresh moves to break the deadlock in
Northern Ireland's flagging peace process.
</P>
<P>
A statement on Steinberg's visit from the U.S. consulate in
Belfast said his purpose was to meet representatives of the
British and Irish governments and the political parties "to gain
their perspectives on the situation here and how to keep the peace
process moving forward."
</P>
<P>
British officials played down the visit, giving out very few
details. Steinberg has no plans to meet the press and officials
would not say which political leaders he will be seeing.
</P>
<P>
Steinberg is expected to brief Clinton on the situation before
traditional St Patrick's Day celebrations -- Ireland's national
day on March 17 -- when Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern is due
to visit the United States.
</P>
<P>
British officials stressed that Steinberg's 24-hour visit was
not a "George Mitchell-style" mission designed to bang heads
together and break the deadlock in the British province.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. senator Mitchell was instrumental in carving out
the 1998 Good Friday peace accord that sought to end 30 years of
sectarian and political strife.
</P>
<P>
In the latest bid to break the deadlock, Britain's Northern
Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson announced on Tuesday that he is
to have talks on Wednesday with Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen
and then stage round-table discussions with Northern Ireland
parties.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's tortuous peace process plunged into yet
another crisis last month when Britain suspended the province's
short-lived home-rule government on the grounds that IRA
guerrillas had given no clear commitment to disarm.

<P>
ATHENS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece's inflation in February
climbed to 2.9 percent year-on-year from January's 2.6 percent,
the National Statistics Services (NSS) announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The NSS attributed the rise in inflation to the fuel price
hikes.
</P>
<P>
Greece's annual inflation was 3.7 percent in February 1999 and
4.3 percent in the same month of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Harmonized consumer price index in the country was at 2.1
percent in February.
</P>
<P>
Greece's National Economy and Finance Minister Yiannos
Papantoniou said Tuesday that despite an unpleasant development in
international oil prices, there was no problem for Greece in
meeting the specific criterion.

On March 9, Greece will apply formally for membership of the
European Union's economic and monetary union (EMU).

<HEADLINE> EU Military Officials Discuss New Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Military officials from European
Union (EU) member states met Tuesday at the EU headquarters for
the first time to prepare for a separate European rapid reaction
force.
</P>
<P>
The officials gathered here for the first meeting of an interim
military committee set up on the basis of agreements reached by EU
leaders during their summit in Helsinki last December.
</P>
<P>
EU's security and foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, said in
a statement that "today is a truly day in the development of the
European Union".
</P>
<P>
"The Helsinki summit set out a number of essential elements for
the establishment of a European security and defense policy. As
part of that project we welcome, for the first time, a committee
of uniformed military officers to the European Union," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of military representatives of the EU member states,
one of the three EU interim bodies for European military
capabilities in the future, was also attended by a group of
military experts, who are considered as the embryo of the future
European Military Staff.
</P>
<P>
Last week, first meeting of the EU's interim Political and
Security Committee was held, which was described as the first
concrete step in setting up a Brussels-based infrastructure to
give political guidance and strategic direction to the
strengthened European Policy on Security and Defense.
</P>
<P>
The new military body is intended to operate alongside with the
interim political and security committee to oversee the creation
of the new EU force by 2003 and will try to ensure smooth
relations with NATO, the United States and the non-EU European
allies.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders have agreed to set up a crisis management force of
about 60,000 troops which would be able to deploy within two
months and stay in the field for at least one year.

<HEADLINE> Direct Losses from Disasters in 1999 Worldwide at 100 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Total losses from natural and man-
made disasters in 1999 are estimated at 100 billion U.S. dollars
excluding indirect economic losses, said the Swiss Reinsurance
Company in its latest edition of Sigma.
</P>
<P>
In the annual study, the Swiss company said that the disasters
last year took more than 105,000 lives, adding that natural
catastrophes were responsible for more than 90 per cent of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
The landslides in Venezuela (pictured) alone caused around 50,
000 fatalities, the Izmit (Turkey) earthquake 20,000 and the
tropical cyclone in Orissa (India) 15,000, said the company. Total
damages were the highest since 1995, the year of the Kobe
earthquake in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Reinsurance company said that due to its devastating
storms and earthquakes, 1999 had far-reaching effects on both
insurers and reinsurers. With a loss burden of 28.6 billion
dollars, 1999 was statistically the second most expensive year
ever for reinsurers after 1992, the year of Hurricane Andrew. It
added that the trend towards high losses that had become apparent
since 1989 was continuing.
</P>
<P>
Man-made catastrophes contributed 4.2 billion dollars to
insurance industry losses, of which half was accounted for by
industrial fires, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
Two big tunnel fires in Europe - in the Mont Blanc and the
Tauern Tunnel - caused 51 fatalities, extensive property damage
and renewed debate on security in road tunnels.
</P>
<P>
Space insurance also had a bad year with six satellite losses,
or 760 million dollars in claims, said the Swiss company. In
aviation insurance, 14 crashes were registered with 660 fatalities
and eight damaged planes on the ground, with claims totaling 600
million dollars.

<HEADLINE> World's Largest Tourism Fair to Open in Berlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The largest tourism fair in the
world, the International Tourism Exchange ITB Berlin, will open
Saturday with a focus on international tourism and electronic
commerce. 8808 exhibitors from 177 countries and territories will
be expected to take part in the exhibition. The fair continues for
five days till 15, March at the Messe Berlin in Charlottenburg.
</P>
<P>
The world tourism develops very rapidly. According to the
report of the World Tourism Organization the number of tourism
visits around the world increased by 3.2 per cent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Raimund Hosch, chairman of the board for Messe Berlin
introduced at the press conference the development of the world
tourism.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East, Central America and South America all had
quick growth in tourism by 10 per cent or more. And at the same
time tourism in Europe was remarkably fueled by a decrease in
tourist visits to Central and Eastern Europe, according to Raimund
Hosch.
</P>
<P>
Hosch stressed that Europe will remain a popular travel
destination, for example, Spain is welcomed by tourists and is the
second-highest tourist destination in the world, following the
United States.
</P>
<P>
About Berlin itself, Hosch added that Berlin had a 16.3 per
cent increase in tourism last year. Berlin's economy has also been
boosted by tourism revenues with almost 8 billion marks (nearly 4
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Hosch pointed also that many of Berlin's recent visitors made
some or all of their travel plans over the Internet. It signs a
world trend toward online travel planning. 134 companies will
represent their travel technology during the fair.
</P>
<P>
This year's ITB Fair also will focus on older travelers. There
is "incredible potential" in the over 50 set because they have
more spare time and more income. They can choose freely the travel
time, especially during the weak tourist season they can fill the
market gap.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Blames U.N. Mission, International Peace-keepers for Worse Security in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Tuesday blamed
the U.N. Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the
international peace-keeping force (KFOR) for failure to protect
Serbs and other non-Albanian civilians in the Serbian province of
Kosovo, saying that terrorists of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA) have been continuing violence against Kosovo non-Albanians
after the international civilian and military presence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The blame came as Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of
the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations, was speaking at a
press conference here. Kosovo "is now in full state of chaos,
lawlessness, terrorism and intimidation of all kinds against Serbs
and non-Albanian population," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Bernard Kouchner, head of UNMIK, argued here Monday
that the mission was mandated to work in an extremely difficult
situation, such as the lack of necessary funds and international
police for the region.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic also provided the text of his speech, originally
prepared for addressing the Security Council meeting, held Monday.
But "one permanent member," as he put it, blocked him from
delivering the speech at the Council meeting although he
previously got the permission to go ahead with the speech.
</P>
<P>
Though he stopped short of identifying the country, he simply
said, "You can guess which one."
</P>
<P>
The speech painted a "sad and sorry picture of Kosovo" since
the presence of UNMIK and KFOR nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
Within the past nine months since the presence of UNMIK and
KFOR in Kosovo in June last year, "we have been witness to
systematic violations of all key provisions of Security Council
resolution 1244," he said in the prepared speech.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted the resolution 1244 on June
10 last year, demanding full respect for the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, and security and equality for
all ethnic groups in Kosovo, and the full disarmament and
disbanding of KLA.
</P>
<P>
"KFOR has done nothing to prevent Albanians" from staging
ethnic cleansing against non-Albanians, he said.
</P>
<P>
In his prepared speech, he said that after the nine-month
presence of UNMIK and KFOR, 4,354 terrorist acts in which 910
people were killed, 802 wounded and 821 abducted, while 350
kidnapped Serbs are kept incarcerated in Albania.
</P>
<P>
More than 350,000 Serbs, Montenegrins, Muslims, Roma, Turks,
Goranci and other non-Albanians have been expelled, he said,
adding that several hundred Serbs have been detained in "labor
camps", controlled by the KLA in the villages of Maticane,
Dragaseveo and Drenica, he said, adding that these camps "are not
even accessible to the Red Cross."
</P>
<P>
During the same period, more than 50,000 houses have been
destroyed, burned or seriously damaged, he said, adding that 84
Orthodox Christian churches, monasteries and cultural-historical
shrines have been destroyed, burned or seriously damaged, and
private and public property continue to be seized.
</P>
<P>
"The Serbs and other non-Albanians, not yet expelled from
Kosovo and Metohija, have been ghettoized in small enclaves,
without a possibility to move out of them on pain of being killed,
kidnapped, terrorized," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Private Investors Urged to Promote Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Tuesday urged private investors in the country to boost exports in
order to promote industrial development.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the call when commissioning a green leaf
threshing plant of the British American Tobacco in Kampala, a
press release from the President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
Local investors were encouraged to consider exporting
locally-produced goods rather than concentrating solely on
importing. The government does not tax exports, Museveni said.
</P>
<P>
The president emphasized the partnership between government and
private investors, noting that it is necessary both for creating
jobs and widening the tax base of the country. For example, the
British American Tobacco brings into the east African country
foreign exchange inflows of over 30 million U.S. dollars per year
apart from paying taxes of a similar amount, according to the
press release.
</P>
<P>
Other investors were also urged to invest in unexploited areas
such as fruit processing and textiles.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president also cautioned policy makers against
enacting laws and regulations that would scare away foreign
investors, saying that the government would try its best to
eliminate smuggling by getting dedicated personnel to combat it.

<HEADLINE> Tuberculosis Cases Rise In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has recorded increased
cases of tuberculosis in connection with the prevalence of HIV and
AIDS in the country, World Health Organization (WHO) country
representative Deogratias Barakamfitiye said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting in commemoration of the World
Tuberculosis and Health Day held in Harare, Barakamfitiye said
officials from Zimbabwe's ministries of Health and Child Welfare
and Finance had been invited to participate in a global summit on
tuberculosis to be held in the Netherlands' capital Amsterdam from
March 22 to 24.
</P>
<P>
"The invitation is to make sure that the ministry officials
will articulate Zimbabwe's strategy to curb tuberculosis
infection," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tuberculosis accounted for 70 percent of infections in HIV/AIDS
cases. " Tuberculosis is now an epidemic but it was not at such
levels before the HIV pandemic," Barakamfitiye said.
</P>
<P>
He said tuberculosis was prevalent in mostly poor communities,
over crowded areas and usually was rampant in promiscuous
environments.
</P>
<P>
The communities needed to be educated on controlling the spread
of the infection in communities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the media to play an active role in the dissemination
of information to be able to achieve this goal.
</P>
<P>
The statistics issued by the Health Ministry indicate that
43,762 tuberculosis cases were recorded in 1997. By 1998, the
number of tuberculosis cases rose by 3,315 to 47,077 with the
disease affecting more men than women.

<HEADLINE> EU Provides Zambia $2.89M for Harbor Rehabilitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has agreed
to provide Zambia 2.89 million U.S. dollars for the rehabilitation
and further development of Zambia's southern harbor of Mpulungu.
</P>
<P>
According to an official statement issued at the signing
ceremony here Tuesday, the funds will be used for the construction
and rehabilitation of a redesigned network of roads and storage
areas, harbor sheds, customs facilities and workshop.
</P>
<P>
Mpulungu Harbor sits at a point where eight countries - Malawi,
Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Burundi,
Uganda and Kenya - come close.
</P>
<P>
It provides a northern route for trade and places Zambia in an
excellent position as the transit point for goods from the
southern part of Africa.
</P>
<P>
A good transport network is an essential factor in the
development of national and regional economies and a network which
has the capacity to improve the economies of several countries
within a region is also a pre- condition for peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government is committed to privatization and has,
on many occasions, recognized the need to liberalize the transport
sector.
</P>
<P>
EU has supported Lusaka's priorities in many sectors and it,
having grown from the principle of regional economic integration,
is actively supporting the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) in its efforts to improve the regional
infrastructure.

JOHANNESBURG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- South African manufacturing
production increased by 3.4 percent during the period from
November 1999 to January 2000, according to figures released on

total manufacturing production, which made the motor vehicle
division increased by 0.8 percent, followed by the basic chemicals
0.6 percent, the paper and paper products 0.5 percent and the
basic iron and steel products 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Youths Urged to Contribute to National Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice-President Christon
Tembo Tuesday called upon the youths, "the greatest asset of the
nation", to contribute to the national development.
</P>
<P>
The youths hold the key in the exploitation of Zambia's natural
 resources which are yet to be adequately tapped for the benefit
of society, Tembo told the Youth Exposition in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president also urged the young people to continue to
expose their enterprise to the government and the general public
so that they are encouraged to perform better and get more
opportunities to market their products.
</P>
<P>
He said the youth exposition is a shopping window which enables
the productive youth of this country to display their products.
</P>
<P>
It is important because "it is only when we see the efforts of
our young people exemplified by their products that we begin to
appreciate that the Zambian youth is indeed the greatest asset of
the nation," Tembo said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president also appeal to youth development agencies to
embark on programs which should host similar expositions at least
once a year.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is trying every
effort to put out bush fires that have been raging for weeks in
southern part of the country, an official told a news briefing
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 70,000 people and all the available logistics have
been mobilized to fire-raged areas in Bale and Borena regions,
said Kuma Demekesa, chief of the National Stirring Committee that
has been charged with the task of controlling the fires.
</P>
<P>
Kuma said the operation of putting out the fires have been
limited to the ground.
</P>
<P>
The air fighting operation would start as soon as the support
from the international community is secured, he said.
</P>
<P>
So far, fire fighters from Germany and South Africa are in
Ethiopia, preparing to help snuff out the fires.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the recurrent drought, coupled with
the high temperatures, the gust wind and the inaccessible terrain,
had aggravated the spread of the wild fire.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Donates $75,000 to Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The U. N. World Food Program
Tuesday received a $75,000 donation by the Government of Kenya to
WFP's emergency operation in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's donation will help feed the hundreds of thousands of
people affected by the massive flood waters that recently
devastated the country, WFP said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
"We greatly appreciate the Kenyan government's contribution at
a time when Kenya itself is confronted with the dire effects of
drought in large parts of the country," said Holdbrook Arthur,
WFP Regional Manager for the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The donation, which was presented by Kenya's President Daniel
Arap Moi to Arthur in Kenya's capital Nairobi Tuesday, is
expected to be put toward purchasing urgently needed food aid for
Mozambique's flood survivors, thousands of whom were stranded for
days on rooftops and in trees without food or clean water.
</P>
<P>
Currently in Mozambique, WFP, in co-ordination with other
agencies and armed forces, is overseeing a massive logistics aid
operation, including a fleet of more than 40 aircraft and 70
boats, to begin distributing food, fresh water and medicine to
more than 500,000 people.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that about 250,000 survivors are staying in over
 65 reception centers set up around the country.

<HEADLINE> Maize Deficit up in SADC Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JHANNESBURG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The latest estimate of the
maize deficit for the 1999/2000 season in the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) region stands at 2.16 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The deficit is more than three times that of the 1998/99
marketing year, when it recorded 548,000 tons, according to a SADC
Food Security Unit quarterly report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This is attributable mainly to the abnormal weather.
</P>
<P>
The region was hit by a severe dry spell and generally
below-normal cumulative rainfall in the first half of the rainy
season from October to December last year.
</P>
<P>
The January-February period this year, however, experienced
increasingly heavy rains, which have caused havoc across the
southern African region, resulting in massive loss of crops and
threatening crop yields in the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
Forecast for Malawi indicates an above average maize harvest of
2.33 million tons, which is a slight reduction over the previous
season's record output of 2.48 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Good maize harvests earlier predicted for Mozambique, South
Africa and Swaziland may have been dampened by recent flooding.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for production in Tanzania remains poor due to poor
rainfall for the region.
</P>
<P>
However, South Africa sees a maize harvest of 8.977 million
tons, a 26 percent more than last season's harvest of 7.1 million
tons due to its substantial shift from growing sunflower to maize,
the preliminary production forecast shows.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Set to Declare Independent State in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat said in the West Bank city of Ramallah
on Tuesday that he will declare an independent Palestinian state
within the year, with or without a peace agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"I declare that there is no turning back on our decision to
declaring national independence within the time ceiling that was
set by the agreements and I declare that the year 2000 is the year
for the Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital," Arafat
said in a speech to the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC).
</P>
<P>
"We are discussing with friends in the world what is the best
way for declaring our state," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat announced his plan just hours before the U.S. Middle East
peace envoy Denis Ross is due back in the region, starting a fresh
round of shuttle diplomacy to revitalize the stalled Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks broke down in February over differences on a delayed
Israeli land transfer of another 6.1 percent of the West Bank to
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side wants Israel to hand over areas east and
north of Jerusalem to them, a demand rejected by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also missed a February 13 deadline for a framework
agreement on a permanent peace deal, due to be concluded by
September 13, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister's Office made no comment on Arafat's
speech, in which he blamed Israel for the present impasse and
called for international intervention to secure a deal.
</P>
<P>
"This is the time of truth. The Israeli government should decide
and put an end to the policy of procrastination, time-wasting and
imposing dictates," Arafat added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak acknowledged on Monday there
were big gaps with the Palestinians on the nature of an agreement
but said he believed the conflict could be solved through talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat bowed to strong Arab and international pressure last May
not to proceed with a unilateral declaration of an independent
state, fearing that such a move could influence the Israeli
elections, which brought Barak to power.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians have repeatedly expressed disappointment
with Barak over his procrastination and failure in implementing
signed agreements.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Stresses Foreign Policy of Detente </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
said here on Tuesday Iran will stick to the foreign policy of
detente to develop friendly relations with all countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran's strategy is based on detente, and Iran has decided to
create an atmosphere of mutual understanding and respect with other
countries in the region and the world, Khatami said in his meeting
with visiting German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran's policy of dialog among cultures have been put
forward with the aim of creating a world free of tyranny,
injustice, discrimination, poverty, fratricide and illegitimate
domination, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
On Iran-Germany relations, the president said there is "
positive" ground for cooperation between the two countries, adding
the Iranian people's attitude toward Germany is positive due to the
lack of colonial ties with the country.
</P>
<P>
Khatami further said Iran and Germany can establish better and
more extensive ties in the fields of politics and economy.
</P>
<P>
Germany can effectively contribute to Iran's reconstruction and
development in view of its advanced facilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped cooperation between Iran and Germany at the
international level will further expand in light of Fischer's
current visit to Tehran and his upcoming visit to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Fischer arrived here Monday night for a two-day official visit
aimed at mending fences and making preparations for Khatami's visit
to Germany in the near future.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated Iran on the holding of the sixth parliament
elections on February 18.
</P>
<P>
The election, which resulted in a landslide victory of
reformists, has been admired by all countries, especially by Europe
and the United States, he told Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The German minister expressed the belief that Iran can take an
effective step toward the establishment of stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Continued democratization and industrial development in Iran
provide an opportunity for stability in the entire region as well
as the restoration of global peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for dialog among civilizations and cultures, Fischer said he
believes Iran's relations with Europe, Germany and other developed
countries can greatly contribute to the dialog.
</P>
<P>
He said his country is looking forward to welcoming Khatami
because the visit can serve as an effective step toward the
restoration and consolidation of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting with Khatami, Fischer held talks with his Iranian
counterpart Kamal Kharrazi and Parliament Speaker Nateq Nouri to
exchange views on issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the biggest importer of non-oil commodities from Iran
and one of Iran's major trading partners.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries were strained last year due
to the imprisonment of a German businessman who was sentenced to
death for an affair with an Iranian woman and a Berlin court's
ruling that Tehran had ordered the slaying of three Kurdish
dissident leaders and their translator in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The German businessman was acquitted of the charges and was
released in January.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Predicted to Hit New High in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Gas prices may hit one Canadian
dollar(about 0.69 U.S. dollars) a litre by the end of May, the
country's newspapers Tuesday quoted a U.S. energy analyst as
warning.
</P>
<P>
Prices could go as high as 2.25 to 2.30 U.S. dollars per gallon
in the United States and "we're going to see severe shortages"
carry over into Canada, bringing local prices to over one Canadian
dollar, said John Kilduff of FIMAT USA, Inc.
</P>
<P>
The senior vice-president with the New York City-based
brokerage firm made the prediction while the U.S. Energy
Department Monday forecast a price jump of 20 cents in May from
the current 1.5 U.S. dollars a gallon -- even if the world's oil
producers increase production.
</P>
<P>
Gas prices have repeatedly broken records in recent weeks in
Canada, where some worst hit communities are seeing a price of 80
cents (about 0.55 U.S. dollars) a litre.
</P>
<P>
The digits flashing in front of Canadian gas stations over the
past few days have never been higher, with an average price in
major cities ranging from 62.7 cents (about 0.43 U.S. dollars) a
litre in Calgary to 78.5 cents (about 0.54 U.S. dollars) in
Yellowknife.
</P>
<P>
Canadian industry watchers agree that Canada's prices likely
will remain high, despite last week's good news that three major
energy producing countries plan to push other oil producers later
this month to expand output.

<HEADLINE> Police Called in to Probe Federal Grant for Montreal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Police have been called in to
investigate the fate of a federal grant of 165,000 Canadian
dollars(about 113,586 U.S. dollars) intended for Montreal's
Rosemont district, the city's Gazette newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The grant was alleged to have ended up generating jobs in Prime
Minister Jean Chretien's riding.
</P>
<P>
The police inquiry came Monday after last week's forensic audit
by the Toronto firm Kroll Linquist Avey at the request of the
Human Resources Department, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
At issue is a grant awarded in December 1997 to a company known
as 3393062 Canada Inc., ostensibly to create 42 jobs in the
clothing industry in Rosemont, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
It ended up renting space instead from Confections St. Elie,
another apparel firm in Saint-Elie-de-Caxton in Chretien's riding
of St. Maurice, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
George Goldberger, president of the numbered company, has
described the switch as purely a business decision and denied
there was any political motive for the move.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Surges in Fourth Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The productivity of American
workers surged at a 6.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter of 1999,
marking the strongest jump in productivity growth in seven years,
the Labor Department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
That revised estimate pushed productivity growth for all of
last year to 3 percent, better than the government's previous
estimate of 2.9 percent and up from 2.8 percent in 1998. It was
the best showing on workers' efficiency gains since a 4.1 percent
increase in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The surge in fourth-quarter productivity, measuring the output
per hour of workers outside the farm sector, was stronger than the
5 percent annual rate of growth the Labor Department reported one
month ago. In the third quarter, productivity grew by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new fourth-quarter estimate marked the biggest leap in
productivity growth since a 7.4 percent rise at the end of 1992.
</P>
<P>
In the manufacturing sector, productivity rose 10.3 percent
during the fourth quarter, which was the highest gain since a 12.3
percent rise in the second quarter of 1982.
</P>
<P>
With productivity high, unit labor costs were restrained,
declining 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter, which was a much
larger decrease than a previous fourth quarter estimate of a 1
percent decline. The fourth quarter decline follows a 0.3 percent
drop in the third quarter and was the largest decrease since a 3.9
percent drop in the fourth quarter of 1992.
</P>
<P>
Unit labor costs for the whole year of 19999 were up 1.7
percent, down from a 2.4 percent gain in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Economists consider healthy productivity gains the key to
prosperity and rising living standards. Sizable gains means
companies can pay employees more, hold the line on prices and
still deliver increased profits to shareholders. Computers,
satellites and other technological advances are credited with
helping to boost workers' productivity.
</P>
<P>
The recent upturn in productivity since 1996 has left some
analysts believing that huge business investments in computers are
finally beginning to pay off and the country is in a new economic
era that will be marked by stronger productivity gains.

and every one of us to become responsible trustees of the Planet
and to renew our pledge to protect the amazing web of life that
sustains us," Toepfer said.
</P>
<P>
"World Environment Day gives us an opportunity to promote
people's participation in caring for the environment, and to raise

<P>
According to plan, the main event to be held in Adelaide on
June 4 will culminate with the presentation of UNEP's Global 500
awards to the individuals and organizations who have made
outstanding contributions to the protection of the environment.
</P>
<P>

 China Will Never Allow Any Splitting Activities

<HEADLINE> 2 SLA Militiamen Killed, 1 Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Two members of the Israel-allied
South Lebanon Army (SLA) were killed and another wounded in fresh
attacks mounted by Hezbollah guerrillas in early Tuesday, Lebanese
security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The SLA has confirmed that one militiaman was killed and another
wounded in guerrillas' attacks on its outpost in the west part of
the occupied zone. A third was killed in a blast in the same
region.
</P>
<P>
These were the first casualties suffered by Israeli camp since
Israeli cabinet voted unanimously on Sunday to quit south Lebanon
by July, the first anniversary of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's government.
</P>
<P>
The pullout decision, with or without an agreement with Lebanon
and its powerbroker Syria, was made amid growing Israeli public
pressure for immediate pullout and escalating Hezbollah attacks on
Israeli troops in south Lebanon, in which seven Israeli soldiers
have been killed so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Syrian- and Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, which has
been fighting since Israel carved out a border strip in 1985 to end
the Israeli occupation, has claimed responsibility for the
onslaughts.
</P>
<P>
The security sources said that Hezbollah also hit three other
outposts in south Lebanon, but caused no casualties.
</P>
<P>
The casualties have raised the fatalities of the SLA militants
to 14 and the injuries to 19 since the outset of this year.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Germany Stress Removal of Impediments to Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Germany agreed Tuesday to
further expand bilateral relations by removing impediments to the
improvement of ties, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Both Iranian Foreign Minister Khamal Kharrazi and his visiting
German counterpart Joschka Fischer expressed the ideas to reporters
at the end of their first round of talks.
</P>
<P>
"We had good talks. Mr. Fischer's visit is taking place at a
time when we should get prepared for President Mohammed Khatami's
official visit to Germany," the Iranian foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, in addition to reviewing bilateral
relations as well as political, economic and cultural issues, views
were exchanged on the preparations for Khatami's forthcoming visit.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the immense potentials as well as historical
background of cooperation between the two countries, Kharrazi
expressed the hope that a new chapter will be opened in the Iran-
Germany relations.
</P>
<P>
Fischer for his part said that Germany enthusiastically follows
developments in Iran, adding that his country was highly impressed
by Iran's recent parliamentary elections, enforcement of democracy
and its results.
</P>
<P>
The elections, held last month, led to a landslide victory of
reformists supporting President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Fischer referred to his talks with Kharrazi as "highly
constructive," adding that they discussed issues of mutual interest
as well as the existing differences of opinion.
</P>
<P>
Disarmament, peace in the Middle East, anti-drug fight and human
rights were among topics he discussed with his Iranian counterpart,
Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is a strategic and important country enjoying an important
status," Fischer said, noting that the German government is ready
to expand and strengthen relations with Iran by holding explicit
and free talks on all issues.
</P>
<P>
He said a sound Tehran-Berlin relations benefits both countries
as well as the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Fischer arrived here Monday night for a two-day official visit,
the first by a German foreign minister since 1991, his visit aims
at mending fences and making arrangements for upcoming visit of
President Khatami to Berlin, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Germany went through a tough period in their
traditional relations and it is hoped that the two countries would
be able to improve their relations, Fischer said upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the biggest importer of non-oil commodities from Iran
and one of Iran's major trading partners.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' traditionally close commercial relations have
been strained in recent years by incidents including the arrest and
imprisonment of a German businessman and a Berlin court's ruling
that Tehran had ordered the slaying of three Kurdish dissident
leaders and their translator in Berlin.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Refutes Iranian Allegation on POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has set free all Iranian
Prisoners of War (POW) under the supervision of the International
Committee of the Red Cross, an Iraqi foreign ministry spokesman
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman hit back at Abdullah Najafi, chief of the POWs
Committee of Iran, who said on Monday there are still Iranian POWs
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
These allegations uttered by Najafi and those alike are
concoction and are intended to mislead the Iranian people regarding
the number of those killed in the Iraq-Iran war, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman urged Iran to abide by the agreement
signed by both sides in January, 1998 and release all Iraqi POWs it
still holds.
</P>
<P>
The issue of POWs has been a major obstacle to the normalization
of the relations between Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Tehran maintains Baghdad is still holding some 2,800 Iranian
POWs, while Baghdad claims more than 13,000 Iraqi POWS are still
held in custody by the Iranian authorities. However, both sides
have repeatedly declared all of the POWs of the other side have
been set free.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq, which fought the eight-year-long bloody war
beginning from 1980, started to exchange POWs in recent years to
repair relations.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, Iran unilaterally declared to set free 276
Iraqi POWs and in April 1998, the two sides exchanged more than 310
Iranian POWs and 5,500 Iraqi POWs.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Women Enjoy Equal Status as Men: NTUC Leader  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Singapore union has helped women
in the country to enjoy equal status as men and strike a balance
between work and family, a senior union official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a written interview to Xinhua, Halimah Yacob, Assistant
Secretary-General of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and
Chairperson for NTUC Women's Committee, also envisaged that women
will play an increasing role in the social life and economic area
as well as in union work in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, Halimah said "generally women enjoy
equal status as men and in some cases may be even better protected
compared to men."
</P>
<P>
She cited that the current women labor participation rate hit
52.7 percent with 23 percent of employed women engaged in
managerial,professional and technical jobs.
</P>
<P>
Answering the question "if women and men enjoy equal pay for
equal work," Halimah said NTUC applies laws to protect women
workers' needs and interests and both men and women are paid the
same wages and benefits under the collective agreements which the
unions negotiate with employers.
</P>
<P>
Halimah said that the NTUC has actively been pursuing ways and
means to help women balance work and family, encouraging companies
to adopt flexible working hours or flexible benefits,organizing
seminars and bringing forth publications to help educate women on
the importance of maintaining healthy families and enhancing
communications at home.
</P>
<P>
The NTUC also runs many childcare centers to provide reasonably
priced quality child care services for working women and work with
other women organisations in order to push the women's agenda and
to influence public policies on women, she added.
</P>
<P>
Underlining that the biggest challenge today for all workers is
to ensure that they continue to remain employable, Halimah said
the NTUC has embarked on the Skills Upgrading Program and this
scheme,strongly supported by the government, has helped many
female workers particularly those in the manufacturing industry to
upgrade their skills and averted retrenchment.

<HEADLINE> Globalisation Needs Int'l Regulation: French Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Foreign Trade
Minister Francois Huwart Tuesday said here that a globalized world
economy calls for the establishment of accepted multilateral rules.
</P>
<P>
"International regulation remains at the core of the stakes of
globalized world economy," said Huwart while delivering a lecture
on the topic of globalization issues.
</P>
<P>
He said that trade liberalization should be balanced by the
reinforcement of the rules of the multilateral system.
</P>
<P>
"Economic opening must be accompanied by appropriate policies
within a stable and transparent framework of multilateral rules,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis which hit hard at some Asian countries in
1997 and 1998 was a clear proof of this, the French minister said.
</P>
<P>
Resolving the Asian crisis clearly necessitates an integrated
development framework reconciling global approach, partnership,
and coordination, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This should lead to a framework of accepted multilateral rules,
governing both trade and finance," he added.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the interest of all that a clear, stable and
transparent framework of rule be set up and be reinforced at
multilateral level," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that intensified dialogue, particularly
between Europe and Asia, is the key to bringing perceptions closer
and clearing the way for points of agreement.
</P>
<P>
The French minister arrived in Singapore on Tuesday for a two-
day visit, during which he will call on Deputy Prime Minister Lee
Hsien Loong and meet with other officials.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade relations and French companies' projects in
Singapore will be on the agenda, as well as multilateral questions
such as the WTO negotiations after Seattle.

<HEADLINE> WFP Airlifts Food, Equipment to Flood Victims in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
country office in Uganda said on Tuesday that it is airlifting
urgently needed food commodities and other equipment to Mozambique
to assist thousands of people displaced by the devastating floods.
</P>
<P>
The aid being sent to the southern African country includes 100
tons of high-energy biscuits donated by the government of Denmark,
and telecommunications equipment, a WFP official announced at a
press conference here.
</P>
<P>
In addition to food and equipment, WFP is also sending five
staff members to help the country in the relief operations. The
first airlift left Tuesday morning from Entebbe by a WFP chartered
Hercules C-130, followed by rotations during the week.
</P>
<P>
Burkard Oberle, the WFP Great Lakes Regional Manager, said: "We
have achieved a high degree of preparedness in the region and are
ready to assist our colleagues in Mozambique in the massive relief
efforts."
</P>
<P>
The tropical storms in the past few weeks, which brought
torrential rains to the southern African sub-region, have claimed
hundreds of lives and made tens of thousands of others homeless.
</P>
<P>
International humanitarian aid has poured into the country as
foreign military helicopters are roaming to pick up flood victims
from treetops or rooftops.
</P>
<P>
So far Mozambique has received a total of 20 million U.S.
dollars worth of humanitarian aid.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Plans to Host Another Round of Burundi Peace Talks: Spokeswoman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela is planning to receive in the next two or
three weeks groups close to the Burundi peace talks and travel to
Burundi or Tanzania's northern town of Arusha, Mandela's
spokeswoman said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
By saying this, the spokeswoman Zelda La Grange dismissed
recent reports that 81-year-old Mandela would quit his mediation
in the Burundi peace process because of his poor health.
</P>
<P>
La Grange said that Mandela is in "very good health" and will
press on with his mediation in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The reports were prompted after Mandela said in Nigeria at the
weekend that he might "sooner or later" not be able to continue
his political work, including that in Burundi, because of
circumstances that were beyond "our control" .
</P>
<P>
The statement had been poorly interpreted, La Grange said,
adding that Mandela "did not say he was sick or resigning ..." but
that when that time arrives he is confident the continent has many
competent young people who could complete that work.
</P>
<P>
La Grange told reporters that the ex-president was preoccupied
with busy programs which include trips to South Africa's Western
Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces scheduled for the next
few days.
</P>
<P>
Mandela last December succeeded former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere who died last October, as the chief mediator for
the Burundi peace talks aimed at ending the conflict between the
Tutsi-led Burundian government and Hutu rebels, which has claimed
some 200,000 lives since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Burundian government and opposition parties concluded their
latest round of talks Sunday in Arusha where the negotiating teams
have drafted proposals for a period of transition and integration
of Hutu rebels into the Tutsi-dominated army and government.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said Tuesday that up to 1,800 Chechen rebels are now
blocked by federal troops in the republic.
</P>
<P>
A group of at least 1,000 militants under rebel commander
Ruslan Gelayev "have been fully immobilized, blocked and besieged
by destruction for a third day" in Komsomolskoye, south of the
Chechen capital of Grozny, the Itar-Tass news agency quoted
Sergeyev as saying.
</P>
<P>
Another 800 rebels have been surrounded by federal forces in
Ulus-Kert, Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
"Our forces and skills are sufficient for eliminating the
remaining bandits and creating conditions for a peaceful life in
Chechnya," Sergeyev added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rebels trapped at the northern entrance of Argun
Gorge continued their attempts to break out of the noose thrown
around them by the federal troops, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Air and artillery attacks Monday inflicted heavy losses on the
rebels, the provisional press center of the federal force in the
North Caucasus said.
</P>
<P>
In face of mounting federal offensives, the rebels have decided
to flee the combat zone in small groups of 15-20, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Colonel General Gennady Troshev, deputy commander of
the federal forces in the North Caucasus, said up to 1,000 Chechen
rebels were destroyed in the previous three to four days.

<HEADLINE> Russian Foreign Minister Pledges Active Role in Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Tuesday that Moscow stands ready to play an active
role in the Balkans in the interest of stability and security.
</P>
<P>
"All international forces must intensify their efforts to solve
Balkan problems, including the Kosovo problem," Ivanov told
reporters following talks with Carl Bildt, the United Nations
secretary-general's envoy to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Bildt, who said he came to Moscow for political reasons, said
no peace agreement has yet been reached about Kosovo. The
situation in many parts of the region is complicated, which
hampers the work of the U.N. mission, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. thinks Security Council members should hold more
intensive talks on these problems, Bildt said, urging the United
States, Europe and Russia to cooperate more closely in developing
a working mechanism to solve the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
Russia has some 3,600 troops stationed in the Yugoslav province
as part of the 40,000-strong multinational peacekeeping force
known as KFOR.
</P>
<P>
Bildt said he and Ivanov have agreed that the U.N. should
provide more facilities to protect Kosovo minorities, both
Albanians in the north of Mitrovica and Serbs in the south, where
an intense Albanian-Serb standoff continues.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, describing the current situation in Kosovo as explosive,
called for "preventive measures" such as enlarging the U.N. police
force, cracking down on Albanian separatists and speeding up work
to formulate Kosovo's status.
</P>
<P>
"Only measures taken in these three fields can make it possible
to take the edge off the tension in the province and achieve a
proper settlement," the Russian minister said.

WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- NBA star Charles Barkley
accepted Turner's two-year deal as an NBA analyst Monday, starting
with the 2000-2001 season.
</P>
<P>
Barkley, 36, whose playing career is ending with Houston after
he ruptured his quadriceps tendon, will be an occasional studio
guest this season. He will be on TNT for tonight's 8 ET Phoenix-
Houston game.
</P>
<P>
"I met with NBC Sports Chariman Dick Ebersol a couple of time,"
Barkley said Monday. "And NBC Sports President Ken Schanzer also
was terrific. But I felt the guys at TNT really wanted me more. I
want to do movies, and to have that built in with Turner/Time
Warner's opportunities was a bonus for Turner. That's what I
really want for my future, and that gave me great confidence in
them."
</P>
<P>
Barkley might have been too expensive for NBC.
</P>
<P>
"We wish Charles well," NBC's Ebersol said. Top pay for
analysts at his network is $650,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
"Our company sold him, not the money," said Turner vice
president Greg Hughes, whose network is paying Barkley in the high
six figures.
</P>
<P>
Turner Sports President Mark Lazarus said: "We're ecstatic in
adding Charles to what we believe is the best array of talent at
any network in any sport."

Despite the emergence of some promising e-business models in
China, few turned out to be successful, due to inadequacy or
inefficiency in China's payment and sending systems.

consultation to Chinese enterprises who are determined to convert
their traditional business models into e-business ones.

<HEADLINE> Experts Have Different Views on IP Phones And Ordinary Phones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Experts from the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (CAS) have cautioned the development of the IP phone
industry because they firmly believe the installing and connecting
ordinary telephones is a far more urgent task for China's populous
country.
</P>
<P>
There are two schools of thought on the development of Internet
Protocol (IP) phones in China. One is that the IP phones will soon
make normal telephone calls a thing of the past service. The other
is that the telecom services will still be booming for the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
Experts from CAS and other government organizations pointed out
in a recent report on the rapid development of IP phones in China
and overseas that IP phones and the ordinary phones have their
advantages and disadvantages. They said that IP phones sometimes
have the time delay problem in digital service. The normal
telephone does not has such delay in voice service but it cannot
offer a combined use of other services.
</P>
<P>
Many developed countries announced that the use of digital
phone or IP phones will make ordinary telephone redundant and will
almost replace the telephones within five to ten years.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists are striving to improve their
telecommunication technology so that China will be on par with
developed countries in the near future.
</P>
<P>
However, many experts believe that in China, where only 12
percent of the population use telephones, it is more important to
spread the use of ordinary telephones rather than develop new
technology.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Gaofeng, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of
Engineering, said that to avoid big economic losses, China should
carefully consider its own telecom industry as well as overseas
counterparts before developing the IP phone industry in China.

<HEADLINE> Top Advisors Call for Developing Environmental Protection Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China faces good opportunities to develop this "sunrise"
industry, said the members of the Ninth National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
attending the on-going CPPCC session.
</P>
<P>
The environmental protection industry is estimated to generate
600 billion U.S. dollars worldwide this year, far exceeding other
sunrise industries like tourism and software, according to
Professor Shen Jiaqi of the Shandong Industrial University.
</P>
<P>
Lin Ziliang, from central Hunan Province, and Wang Zhongkang,
from southwestern Sichuan Province, called for using urban waste
to generate resources and wealth.
</P>
<P>
Luo Long, vice-mayor of Nanning, the regional capital of the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, said that accelerated
development of the environmental protection industry could bring
along enormous social results.
</P>
<P>
The 140 million tons of urban garbage in China could save 23.33
million tons of coal if used to generate electricity, or could be
turned into 150 million tons of organic fertilizer, if processed
with dejecta and straw, Luo said.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Call for Regulating Toy Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Deputies of the Shanghai
delegation to the 3rd Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress has put forth a motion calling for formulating
regulations concerning toy manufacturing and marketing.
</P>
<P>
For lucrative purposes, some toy manufacturers are selling toys
that do harm to children's physical and psychological health,
according to the motion signed by over 30 deputies.
</P>
<P>
The toys include a kind of "laser pen", used as a teaching tool,
which radiates laser spectrum that can burn retina, and faked
western-style toys, ranging from M16 rifles to AK47 Tommy guns. "
The toy guns resemble real ones, easy to stimulate kids' pugnacity,
" said Zhang Zhongli, the first NPC deputy to raise the motion.
</P>
<P>
Some other toy producers even go so far as to pack up magnetic
sticks and flying disks together with cones and instant noodles,
leaving kids that eat them vulnerable to any possible harm.
</P>
<P>
China has 380 million kids below the age of 14. The country's
toy sales is estimated at about 10 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Self-discipline, Supervision Should Go Hand in Hand to Fight Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Self-discipline should be combined
with rigid, strict supervision for building a clean and honest
government and training upright officials, said a senior Communist
Party of China (CPC) official.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee and secretary of the CPC Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection, made this call today while attending a
group discussion of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region deputies to
the Ninth National People's Congress, in session here since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party has defined the major tasks for the anti-
corruption move, involving two issues, namely, fostering upright
conduct and bringing corrupted officials into justice, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
An unhealthy Party style does direct harms to the masses of
people's interests and seriously deteriorate the relations between
officials and the masses of ordinary people, defaming the Party's
image. "Wherever unhealthy Party style prevails, there are more
offense cases and more corrupted elements."
</P>
<P>
Two lines of defense, which refers high ethical standard-Party
disciplines and strict state laws, should be erected with top
priority given to maintaining a high ethical defense line, he said.
</P>
<P>
A sound, upright Party style of work must be established with
enhanced efforts made to rely on self-discipline, extensive
education, systems, and supervision, and officials at all levels
should often be told what to do and what not to do so as to be
immune from being corrupted, He said.
</P>
<P>
"We have adopted a whole series of regulations and disciplines
in recent years, but why haven't we scored remarkable progress? An
important reason is that the Party organizations in some areas are
lax in Party education, administration, and supervision," Wei said,
pinpointing to the crux of the matter characterized with the
phenomenon of "peacemaking and philistinism" prevalent within the
Party.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Wei noted that the main stream of the ranks of
Party cadres are good, and most officials are restrict with
themselves and set high standards on their personal conduct.

<HEADLINE> Expert Proposes Countermeasures on Eve of WTO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior economic reform expert
has proposed six countermeasures to cope with foreseeable
challenges China may face when the country joins the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
According to Gao Shangquan, president of the Chinese Society of
Economic Structural Reform, WTO membership will bring four
challenges to China: a challenge to the competitiveness of some
Chinese industries and companies on the world market; a challenge
to China's administrative system; a challenge to China's
industrial structure; and a challenge to the Chinese government's
macro-economic control ability.
</P>
<P>
The six countermeasures he proposed are as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- To make a strategic readjustment of the state-owned economy,
create a micro-basis for a market economy, and increase the
competitiveness of Chinese enterprises;
</P>
<P>
-- To speed up financial reform to ensure a comparatively high
growth of the economy;
</P>
<P>
-- To speed up the development of the country's west and the
process of urbanization, in a bid to boost a coordinated
development of regional economies as well as urban and rural
economies;
</P>
<P>
-- To accelerate reform of the government's administrative
system and to establish a legal foundation for a market economy;
</P>
<P>
-- To implement the strategy of developing the nation with
science, technology and education; and
</P>
<P>
-- To continue implementing the open policy.

Hu made the call when discussing with deputies from southwest
China's Guizhou Province the government work report delivered by
Premier Zhu Rongji Sunday at the annual session of the nation's
legislature.
</P>
<P>
"There is no experience to follow or old mode to duplicate when
we develop the west under market economic conditions. Leading
officials must have a high sense of responsibility and mission,
learn from their own experience and seek a new path," said Hu,
also a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Hu also urged local officials to strengthen ties with the
people, bear in mind the principle of serving the people with all
heart, and seek every possible way to solve their problems and
help them out of difficulties.
</P>
<P>
When speaking of Guizhou, Hu said that the government strategy
to prioritize the country's west for economic development will
create precious opportunities for such regions including Guizhou,
and the province needs to seek a new path for development based on
its own natural conditions and social and economic realities.
</P>
<P>
During the discussion, deputies aired their views on topics
such as speeding up transport infrastructure, supplying electric

<HEADLINE> T-bond Issuance Won't Lead to Financial Crisis: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li Yining, member of the Standing Committee of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), said during a group discussion
of the Hunan delegation to the ongoing NPC session that China
still has some room for T-bond issuance at a time when it enjoys
sufficient material supplies and stable prices.
</P>
<P>
The majority of China's T-bonds are used for infrastructure
construction, environmental and ecological protection, science and
technology, and technical upgrading. "Those are the right
investment areas that can kick-start domestic demand and boost
economic growth," Li said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a politically stable China, with most of its
people living and working in peace and contentment, has adequate
solvency and credibility, the economist said.
</P>
<P>
China will issue another 100 billion yuan of long-term T-bonds
this year to beef up infrastructure-facelifting projects. It
issued 210 billion yuan of long-term T-bonds over the past two
years.

<HEADLINE> Victims of Chemical Weapons Protest at Germany Embassy in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- About 150 Iranian victims of
chemical weapons in the 1980-88 Iraq-Iran war staged a sit-in in
front of the German embassy in Tehran on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The victims, mostly disabled, lodged a protest to visiting
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer against German companies
which provided Iraq with chemical weapons during the war and
demanded reparations, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
A group of demonstrators, wearing anti-gas masks and clothes,
called on Fischer to join them to understand better their
sufferings.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome you to the land of withered flowers, but we demand
that you, as a responsible official, observe the boundaries of
humanity and thus close and condemn plants manufacturing chemical
weapons," said Dr. Kamran, who has to carry an oxygen mask due to
breathing problems caused by chemical wounds.
</P>
<P>
The sit-in ended when Fischer received a representative of the
protestors at the embassy, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi called for an
end to the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
In a message, Kharrazi assured the disabled that the issue will
be included in the agenda of talks with his German counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Fischer arrived in Tehran Monday night for a two-day visit,
during which he will talk with Iranian officials on bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Iranian judicial authorities demanded 24 German firms
and a number of German government officials to stand before an
Iranian court on charges of supplying chemical weapons to Iraq
during the war.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the judicial branch said that the families of
the victims and the disabled asked for compensation for their
sufferings and losses of lives.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran had collected a considerable amount of
information regarding Germany's involvement in chemical weapons
supplies to Iraq during the eight-year war.
</P>
<P>
Some 25,000 Iranians were killed and 65,000 Iranian veterans
were injured in the war with Iraq as victims of chemical bombs, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Accused of Attempted Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Police had launched
criminal investigation against Transport Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
over the charges of sexual harassment and attempted rape, Israel
Radio reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio reports, Mordechai called one member
of his staff, a 23-year-old woman, to his office in a night ten
days ago. Then he advanced her, forced her to ground and began to
remove her clothes, which was stopped after the woman burst out in
tears.
</P>
<P>
The employee later sobbed out the events to several Knesset
(Parliament) members and civil service commissioners. She was then
turned to State Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein, who
immediately ordered the launch of a police investigation.
</P>
<P>
Police questioned the young woman with a lie-detector exam,
which indicated she was telling the truth. Yossi Sedbon, the
commander of the Police Investigation Unit, is heading the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, also leader of the Center Party in the ruling
coalition, said he did not want to respond to such a silly matter.
His wife also stated that she believed her husband is not that type
of person.
</P>
<P>
The minister is expected to be summoned to police in the next
few days to present his side of the events and defend himself
against the accusation.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office said that
Barak was informed of the investigation only on Tuesday morning and
he would respond at a later stage.
</P>
<P>
The officials also clarified that the meeting between Barak and
Mordechai on Monday night had no links with the allegations and
they were dealing with other matters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some Mordechai's cabinet colleagues had urged him to
step down, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami called upon Mordechai to
leave his post temporarily while waiting for the outcome of the
investigation. Ben-Ami said such a voluntary break would not be an
indication of guilt.
</P>
<P>
Construction and Housing Minister Yitzhak Levy, who is also
chairman of the National Religious Party, warned that if Barak did
not remove Mordechai, his party might file in a no-confidence
motion against the government on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who is challenging
Mordechai's leadership in the Center Party, also urged Mordechai to
step down as party leader.
</P>
<P>
Knesset Member and famous women activist Yael Dayan, from
Barak's One Israel coalition, also condemned the alleged actions of
Mordechai in a context that Tuesday is also the International Women
Day in Israel.
</P>
<P>
As a former Israel Defense Forces major general, Mordechai
joined the Likud faction in the 1996 general elections and later
became the defense minister in former prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's government.
</P>
<P>
However, Mordechai, widely considered as a moderate in the
right-wing government, was at odds with Netanyahu over a number of
issues, especially the peace process with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Before the 1999 elections, Mordechai defected to the Center
Party and ran for premiership himself. He announced to quit the
race at the last minute, which helped Barak defeat Netanyahu in the
first round by a large margin. He and his Center Party later joined
Barak's ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Although some analysts are confident that Mordechai will be
acquitted of the accusations soon, they still worries that in such
a critical moment in the Israeli-Arab peace process, any
instability in already crumbling Barak government will lead to a
real political earthquake in Israel.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that three of Barak's coalition partners, the
orthodox religious Shas party, the National Religious Party and the
Yisrael Ba'aliya party had already voted against the government in
the Knesset several times.

<HEADLINE> Immediate Resumption of Pak-India Talks Ruled Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Foreign Minister Abdul
Sattar Tuesday said there is no proposal either by Pakistan or
India for immediate resumption of dialogue to end tension between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign minister, when talking to reporters here,
reiterated that Pakistan is prepared to take up all outstanding
issues between Pakistan and India if dialogue is resumed.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan has on several occasions expressed its
willingness to resume the stalled dialogue with India, and to
discuss all issues under the Lahore Declaration that was signed
when Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee visited Pakistan
in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sattar underlined the centrality of the Kashmir
problem in relations between the two South Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The world community and neutral observers in South Asian are
already fully aware of the fact that Kashmir is the core issue and
root cause of tension in the region, Sattar observed.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the United Nations Security Council resolution
of June 1998 calls for addressing the root cause in order to
reduce tension between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the budget announced recently by India, the
foreign minister said the massive 28 percent increase in military
spending "further signals India's belligerent intentions."
</P>
<P>
Sattar also blamed India for "proactive policy in Kashmir and
provocative actions across the Line of Control" which divides
Pakistan and Indian in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The thorny relations between Pakistan and India deteriorated
since Pakistan's military takeover in October last year. The
Indian government has ruled out possibility to resume dialogue
with the military government in Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Signs Retail Bill Into Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
signed Tuesday the retail trade bill into law in a bid to attract
more foreign investments, Philippine News Agency (PNA) said.
</P>
<P>
The new law, titled the Retail Trade Liberalization Law, allows
competition among large retailers, which will result in lower
prices and better services to consumers, the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada was quoted as saying following signing the bill that
the passage of the measure showed the Congress' commitment to help
in nation building, especially as the country faces challenges
posed by globalization.
</P>
<P>
"As we all know, globalization is upon us. We cannot afford to
weaken ourselves. We cannot afford to isolate ourselves. We cannot
afford to stay divided as a people in the midst of economic
competition among nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The retail trade bill was approved by both chambers of the
Philippine Congress in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, a foreign retailer must meet some
qualifications before engaging in business in the country,
including a minimum net worth in its parent corporation of between
50 to 200 million U.S.dollars, depending on the category of
business.
</P>
<P>
The law specifies four categories that delineate how much
foreign equity is allowed for a certain paid-up capital.
</P>
<P>
Category A includes entities with paid-up capital of less than
2.5 million dollars, and is reserved for Filipinos. Category B
includes those whose paid-up capital is between 2.5 to 7.5 million
dollars. For the first two years, foreign equity will be allowed
up to a maximum of 60 percent, but 100 percent will be allowed
after that.
</P>
<P>
Category C allows 100 percent foreign ownership of retailers
whose paid-up capital will be at least 7.5 million dollars.
Category D allows 100 percent foreign ownership of stores selling
high-end or luxury products if the minimum capital is at least 250,
000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
As an added safeguard, foreign retailers under Categories B and
C where foreign ownership is 80 percent or higher would be
required to offer their shares to the public within eight years
from the start of operations.
</P>
<P>
Qualified foreign retailers will also be barred from engaging
in activities outside their stores through mobile or rolling
stores or carts, and the use of sales representatives, door-to-
door selling,restaurants.
</P>
<P>
The retail industry was reserved for Filipinos since 1954 due
to the resentment then over the perceived dominance over the
sector by an alien minority.

<HEADLINE> India Rules Out 3rd Party Mediation on Kashmir Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- India Tuesday firmly ruled out
any mediation by the United Nations or any other third party on
the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
"We see no role for any third party, including the U.N., on the
Jammu and Kashmir issue," an Indian foreign office spokesman said
here on Tuesday when asked to comment on the alleged remarks by U.
S. President Bill Clinton that India should become a permanent
member of the U.N. Security Council if it can overcome the "main
obstacle" arising from the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that India's "legitimate claim" to
permanent membership of the U.N. Security Council was based on "a
strong objective criterion."

<HEADLINE> Floods Cost S. Africa's Northern Province $180M in Infrastructures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Northern
Province needs about 1.1 billion rand (some 180 million U.S.
dollars) to repair bridges and roads destroyed by the recent
floods, South African Press Association reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At least 150 bridges and drainage structures have been washed
away or severely damaged and about 5,000 kilometers of tar and
gravel roads will have to be rebuilt, the provincial government
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The floods have had a devastating effect on the province's road
 infrastructure, which makes children in many rural areas unable
to go to school and denies people access to shops or health and
emergency services.
</P>
<P>
The statement said measures such as the construction of
temporary pedestrian and light vehicle bridges are under way with
the help of the South African National Defense Force.
</P>
<P>
However, restoring the whole road network of the province will
require financial help from the national government which is
currently studying assessment reports on the floods damages.

<HEADLINE> WFP Targets Women in Uganda Development Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) would
target women and girls in its programs being or to be carried out
in Uganda, a WFP official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"As we recognize that women are among the most disadvantaged
groups while at the same time representing an enormous potential
for growth, it seems logical to target food aid in recovery and
development projects to women and girls," said Adrian van der
Knaap, who is in charge of gender focal programs in northern
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
In the east African country, some 800,000 internally displaced
people, refugees and drought-affected persons are benefiting from
relief food. Out of the group, 60 percent are women and girls,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
In the past one and a half years, a children-feeding program in
the country's northeastern Karimoja region has increased girl
attendance at primary schools by 25 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the northern Gulu and Kitgum districts, a two-year relief
and recovery program will be launched this April, with women and
girls as the majority of beneficiaries. The program, at a cost of
of 57 million U.S. dollars, is expected to address the widening
gender gap in the region.
</P>
<P>
A press release quoted WFP Executive Director Catherine Bertini
as saying that three-quarters of the people around the world who
need food aid because of war, natural disaster or extreme poverty
are women and children, a ratio she described as an unacceptable
reality.
</P>
<P>
She urged the international community to pay more attention to
women in their relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
By giving women more control over food and other aid, as well
as greater means to become self-sufficient, the world is taking
the most efficient route to helping families cope in any crisis,
Bertini stressed.
</P>
<P>
In Ugandan, women account for 80 percent of the labor force in
agricultural production. However, only seven percent of women own
land themselves. Besides, they do not enjoy equal status with men
and often suffer from pervasive domestic violence.

<HEADLINE> IPU Launches Online Database About "Women in Politics" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU)
is launching the online bibliographical database "Women in
Politics" at its Web site (www.ipu.org) to mark the International
Women's Day on March 8, said IPU on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The database is intended to provide an effective way of gearing
up research and access to bibliographic references to the various
aspects of women's participation in political life, said the IPU.
</P>
<P>
"Women in Politics" contains over 800 references which cover
nearly 100 countries, regularly updated to take into account new
books and articles published throughout the world. The database
is designed to be a "look-out" to spot changes in issues relating
to women's participation in politics.
</P>
<P>
"Today anyone who wants to know what has been written on the
subject of women's participation in political life is faced with a
challenge: not the challenge of the scarcity of bibliographical
references, but rather the difficulty of gaining access to a
reliable database containing a broad selection of bibliographical
references grouped by affinities," said IPU Secretary General
Anders Johnsson.
</P>
<P>
He added that the IPU has proposed to fill the gap with the
online database, "Women in Politics," which was developed with the
financial support of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
and implemented with the support of national parliaments world
wide.
</P>
<P>
"Women in Politics" offers a selection of documents including
references to legal texts (conventions, plans of action,
declarations, etc.), publications and documents from international
organizations (since 1985), publications and articles produced in
various countries by experts and researchers (since 1985) and
Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based IPU, a world organization of parliaments
created in 1889, has 139 member parliaments and five affiliated
regional parliamentary assemblies at present.

<HEADLINE> Germany Proposes New Candidate for IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Germany proposed Horst Koehler as
an option Tuesday for the post of managing director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) after withdrawing U.S.-opposed
candidate Caio Koch-Weser.
</P>
<P>
Koehler, 57, worked as deputy finance minister under Helmut
Kohl and has headed the European Bank of Reconstruction and
Development (EBRC) since July 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement that Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had
asked him if he would like to run as candidate for the IMF's top
position.
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old Koch-Weser said in a statement that he had
written a letter to Shroeder last Saturday to withdraw his
candidacy for the position.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Koch-Weser said that with a clear and definite
rejection from the United States government, it would be difficult
to reach an agreement over his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Until Sunday, Koch-Weser had insisted that he would not
withdraw and accused the United States of putting pressure on
countries to vote against him.
</P>
<P>
The United States publicly opposed his candidacy, casting doubt
over his ability and calling for a more high-profile candidate.
</P>
<P>
The IMF succession battle started when the French former head
Michel Camdessus announced his resignation months ago.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus left office on February 16 and Stanley Fischer, an
American who is currently number two at the IMF, has taken over
the helm of the organization.
</P>
<P>
The post of IMF managing director is traditionally held by a
European, while the World Bank is headed by an American. Both
organizations have their headquarters in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Zhirinovsky Registers as Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia's ultra-right Liberal
Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky was re-registered
Tuesday as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky, who regained his candidacy following a ruling
Monday by the appellate collegiate of the Supreme Court, said he
would emerge in at least third place in the elections scheduled
for March 26.
</P>
<P>
With Zhirinovsky added to the list, 12 candidates will compete
in the race to the Kremlin, but Acting Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin remains the runaway favorite, far ahead of other hopefuls in
opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Trailing in the second and third places were Communist Party
leader Gennady Zyuganov and liberal Yabloko party leader Grigory
Yavlinksy.
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky said he had participated in two presidential
elections before and that both times he picked more than 5 percent
of the votes. He was referring to the two rounds of presidential
balloting in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Considering Zyuganov and Yavlinsky as his main rivals,
Zhirinovsky said Putin is not acting firmly enough in Chechnya,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) re-
registered Zhirinovsky as a presidential candidate on Tuesday, but
CEC Chairman Alexander Veshnyakov said his commission reserves the
right to appeal the Monday ruling.
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky's previous request for registration was rejected by
the commission for failure to declare his son's apartment on his
required income statement.

<HEADLINE> France Affirms Permanence of Lebanon Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said on Tuesday that France's policy toward Lebanon is
permanent despite the controversial statement on Hezbollah made by
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in Israel last month.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with some ambassadors from Arab countries,
Vedrine said that France will continue to engage itself in efforts
to seek a solution to the Middle East conflict on the basis of a
just and balanced peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister and the Arab ambassadors also discussed
the possible resumption of the monitoring group in southern
Lebanon, which supervises a 1996 agreement signed between Israel
and Hezbollah on avoiding attacks on civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Jerusalem on February 25, Jospin said the
attacks launched by Hezbollah against Israeli troops in the
occupied security zone in southern Lebanon were "terrorist acts."
</P>
<P>
The statement by Jospin triggered widespread protest from Arab
countries as well as a violent attack upon him by Palestinians
when he visited the West Bank on February 26.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Rejects Papon's Medical Pardon Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac has
rejected a demand to release former Vichy official Maurice Papon
for health reasons, said the Elysee presidential palace on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The president of the republic was asked on December 23, 1999,
to grant a pardon for medical reasons by the lawyer of Maurice
Papon. After an investigation, the head of state has rejected the
demand for a medical pardon," said the communique of Elysee.
</P>
<P>
Papon, 89, was condemned to 10 years in jail on April 2, 1998,
by a court in Bordeaux, southwest France, for complicity in crimes
against humanity.
</P>
<P>
As a senior official of the Vichy collaboration regime during
World War II, he was responsible for deporting more than 1,600
Jews from the southwest Gironde region to Nazi death camps.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Amsterdam and Eindhoven will ban
outdoor television screens for showing matches during the European
championship finals in June for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
"With an outdoor screen, you get a very large concentration of
supporters which is a threat to public order," an Amsterdam police
spokesman said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In Eindhoven, police said the fear was the same. The city plays
host on June 12 to English fans, who have one of the worst
reputations for hooliganism.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
today extended greetings to women from all walks of life at a
grand ceremony at the Great Hall of the People to mark the 90th
anniversary of International Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Hu reviewed economic and social developments in
China in the past year, noting that despite all kinds of
challenges and difficulties at home and overseas, China's reforms
and opening up and the modernization drive have been a great
success.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the success partly to the hard work and
solidarity of women. Hu said that women in China should continue
to make contributions to fulfilling economic and social targets in
2000.
</P>
<P>
Peng Peiyun, president of the All-China Women's Federation,
said that although the Chinese women's movement has weathered all
kinds of hardships in the past century, they have made great
achievements.
</P>
<P>
Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping Theory
are guiding principles of the women's movement, said Peng, who is
also vice-chairwoman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress. Chinese women should adhere to the basic
national strategy of "equality of men and women" and improve their
overall quality.
</P>
<P>
"We are entering a new millennium which poses both
opportunities and challenge. Chinese women should make full use of
their abilities and struggle for further emancipation and
development," Peng said.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 people attended today's ceremony, including
female ministers, academics, army generals, female deputies to the
Third Session of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, and representatives
from all walks of life in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> HK Holds Seminar to Enhance WTO Awareness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has more to gain than
to fear when it comes to China's accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO), a senior Hong Kong official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Center, Chau Tak Hay, Secretary for Trade and Industry of Hong
Kong, said China's entry into the WTO will bring both challenges
and opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"Because of our knowledge of the mainland's markets, our world-
class business and financial services and our excellent
infrastructure, Hong Kong will be able to expand and enhance its
traditional role as the premier gateway to China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chau said the Hong Kong government strongly supports China's
WTO membership and looks forward to the time when China formally
takes its rightful place in the organization.
</P>
<P>
"Only then can the WTO be regarded as truly global," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chau believed the WTO has played a vital role in promoting a
fair and predictable international trading environment, since it
embodies a set of legally binding rules governing the conduct of
trade in the area of goods, services, and intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
"This is very important, as it enables economies to compete on
a level-playing field," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chau encouraged Hong Kong's businessmen and professional
community to know more about the WTO and its value.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's seminar, entitled "The WTO in the New Millennium:
Opportunities for the Business Sector," is aimed to increase Hong
Kong business and professional communities' awareness of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Experts on WTO-related issues, including Deputy Director-
general of the WTO Miguel Rodriguez Mendoza, delivered speeches on
the history of the WTO, its rules and China's WTO accession.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 participants from across the industrial and academic
fields attended the one-day seminar.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Proposing Drafting Law on Anti-monopoly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Deputies of the National People's
Congress (NPC) from the Shanghai delegation to the 3rd Session of
the Ninth NPC today submitted a motion for formulating the law on
anti-monopoly.
</P>
<P>
Various monopolizing activities have posed a major obstacle to
the growth of market economy, and the harm done by administrative
monopoly, in particular, should merit more attention. A law
concerning anti-monopoly will certainly play an indispensable role
in maintaining market competition order, according to Shanghai NPC
deputies' the motion.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputies from other delegations have also denounced
regional protectionism and trade barriers. The motion points out
that the prohibition of administrative monopoly should be defined
in the first article of the proposed law.
</P>
<P>
Administrative monopoly is the legacy of mis-use of power left
over from the system of long-term planned economy, and is
vulnerable to money-power transactions and other corrupted
practices, said Xu Zuxiong, secretary-general of the Standing
Committee of Shanghai Municipal People's Congress and the first
deputy to set forth the motion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the motion calls for halting the misuse of market
forces, guarding against and preventing economically powerful
enterprises from willfully hiking or cutting prices.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, whoever violates the proposed law will be entitled to
civil and administrative responsibilities, and to criminal
liabilities as well, the motion suggests.
</P>
<P>
China is working to enact laws and regulations for 2000 through
2010, which includes the anti-monopoly law, said Li Fei, an
official with the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongfu, director of the State Administration for Industry
and Commerce, said that practices of administrative monopoly,
forced deals and market blockade are common in China's domestic
market, and that industry and commerce administration departments
across the country will start a nationwide campaign to fight
protectionism so as to maintain fair competition.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Leader Calls for Democratic, Scientific Decision Making </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Ninth
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), emphasized the importance of consultation
prior to decision making.
</P>
<P>
"Consultation is a main function and main work method for the
CPPCC," Li said, noting that all the three generations of leaders
of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) have attached great
importance to consulting with members of CPPCC at different levels.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC leader, who is a member of the Standing Committee of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Political
Bureau, made the remarks at a panel discussion held by CPC members
on the CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Consultations are conducive to getting to know the views and
opinions of various parties, social bodies and people in different
social circles and to democratic, scientific decision making," he
said.
</P>
<P>
A smart leader is wise not because he has a better head than
others but because he is better at learning from others, Li said.
Consultation means being willing to listen to different voices, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC National Committee leader stressed that equality is
the basis for consultation and sincerity the premise. He urged CPC
members in all CPPCC organizations to develop a habit of
consulting with their non-Communist party counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Urges Exploitation of Local Advantages in Developing West China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China's top law-maker said here
today the western regions of the country need to find their
respective development orientation and concentrate on some
priority areas to achieve the goal of fast development.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, made the remark here when discussing with NPC
deputies from northwestern China's Shaanxi Province the government
work report delivered by Premier Zhu Rongji Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"To successfully implement the developing-the-west strategy,
local areas need to have a clear knowledge of their own advantages
and weaknesses first, plan well and conduct feasibility studies,
and adopt concrete measures in that regard," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The central government initiated a strategy to prioritize its
vast economically backward western areas for fast development. As
a result, the topic of developing-the-west has become a hot topic
in today's group discussion attended by deputies from Shaanxi, a
province included in the new development program.
</P>
<P>
Li suggested that Shaanxi focus on developing new and hi-tech
industries, bio-engineering and information projects, water-saving
farming and horticulture.
</P>
<P>
Li said that, while support from the central government is
important for implementing the developing-the-west strategy, hard
work on the part of the local people is what really counts.
</P>
<P>
"People in Shaanxi should work arduously and rely on themselves
to build a prosperous Shaanxi and achieve greater prosperity," Li
said.

Attending group discussions with Inner Mongolia and Zhejiang
deputies to the 9th National People's Congress, in session here
since Sunday, Li said that Jiang Zemin's recent talks on education
are not directed at individual, occasional incidents, but aim to
revitalize the Chinese nation through science and education.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, said: "
reducing the burden" of students means relieving their excessive
homework. The work of reducing students' burden itself is a
systems program involving educational concept, teaching materials,
teaching programs, teaching contents, curricular arrangements,
teaching methodology, teaching quality and efficiency, and reform
of the system of examinations and appraisals, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li called attention to some places where teaching and
organization of extracurricular activities for students have
slackened, as a result of one-sided understanding of "reducing
students' burden."
</P>
<P>
He called for creating a macro environment that is favorable to
all-round quality education for teenagers.

<HEADLINE> China to Help Out Most SOEs This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheng Huaren, minister of the state economic and trade
commission, told a press conference at the on-going Third Session
of the Ninth National People's Congress that the three-year
objective of helping out most of China's large- and medium-sized
SOEs is "definitely attainable."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the same venue, minister of labor and social
security Zhang Zuoji said that an improved social security network
has contributed a great deal to maintaining social stability.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the large- and medium-sized SOEs which were in
the red in 1997 are making profits today, according to Sheng.
</P>
<P>
The state sector has made noticeable progress in reducing debts
and improving economic efficiency in 1999. So far, 3,211 of the 6,
599 state-owned and state-holding large- and medium-sized
enterprises which were in the red in 1997 have turned loss into
profit or have eliminated deficits, Sheng said.
</P>
<P>
China's laid-off workers totaled 6.5 million at the end of last
year, with more than 90 percent of them having received basic
living allowances from the government.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned sector is expected to lay off another five
million workers this year, most of whom would be reemployed, Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
The labor and social security minister predicted that the issue
of laid-off workers as a result of SOE reforms would be resolved
in three years.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Drops Two More Bidders for Copter Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government on Monday
removed two major bidders from a list of candidates vying for a
multi-billion-U.S.-dollar attack helicopter project so as to
further cut costs and get more technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
The German-French consortium Eurocopter and the U.S. Boeing
Company, competing with their Tiger and Apache models respectively,
have been eliminated from the race for submitting "insufficient
information."
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a meeting attended by Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit, Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces Huseyin
Kivrikoglu, Defense Minister Sabahattin Cakmakoglu, Defense
Industry Undersecretary Dursun Ali Ercan and other officials.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey will produce its own helicopter but it will take
advantage of helicopter models developed by countries which have
advanced industries," Ecevit told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey will make additions on this model according to its own
needs. This is a very beneficial approach" for Turkey to establish
its own helicopter-making capacity, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase of the 4-billion-dollar project, which was
launched in 1997, 50 helicopters out of a planned 145 will be co-
produced.
</P>
<P>
The three remaining bidders, the U.S. Bell Helicopter-Textron,
Italy's Agusta and a Russian-Israeli joint venture, are now on the
short-list, said the minister, adding that their proposals will be
further reviewed to clear up some unclear points.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about when the bid winner will be
announced, Ecevit said a decision will be made after the Defense
Industry Undersecretariat completes its technical studies.
</P>
<P>
On speculations concerning the financial sources of the project,
Ecevit said there were no financing problems and Defense Industry
Undersecretariat would undertake most of the funding for the
production.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted that political considerations had no weight
in the bid and the short list was made totally objectively.
</P>
<P>
Monday's announcement came as a second short list of bidders,
thus further delaying the project under which the first delivery of
helicopter was earlier scheduled for November 2002.
</P>
<P>
The first short list of five competitors was made early last
year.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the final winner may be decided after
Turkey's religious feast on March 24 or April at the latest,
according to defense industry sources.

<HEADLINE> Productive Women's House Set up in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Women's Union (TKB) on
Monday opened the "Productive Women's House" in Trabzon, a Black
Sea province, on the eve of the International Women's Day which
falls on March 8.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal in opening Productive Women's House was to make these
women feel economically independent. We are aiming to open larger
places for our women. We are expecting the support of related
institutions while doing this," TKB Trabzon branch's Chairwoman
Hatice Sarac told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the House sent an encouraging message to
Turkish women who have been striving for years for economic
independence and participation in all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
Women in Trabzon province, henceforth, will be able to
contribute financially to their families by selling the food and
handicrafts they make at the House.
</P>
<P>
In Trabzon, women's problems were mainly caused by lack of
education because they "are not offered equal opportunities to go
to school. As a result, they cannot gain their economic
independence," she said.
</P>
<P>
Women who sell their handicrafts at this house are opening to
the society for the first time, Sarac noted. "They are forming
friendships. They are meeting their children's needs with the money
they earn here," she added.
</P>
<P>
Ikbal Ascil, a housewife who sells the desserts she makes at the
house, said she feels very happy about her economic independence. "
I am not asking any money from my husband and it is great to be
able to buy our needs with the money I earn."

</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The governments of Turkey and Japan have decided to
set up a joint energy saving center in Turkey, Turkish Daily News
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The project, part of a protocol signed in Ankara Monday, is
aimed at effectively maintaining an energy management system in the
industrial sector. Ten percent of the energy consumed by the sector
will be saved over a five-year term, equal to 2 million tons of
equivalent petroleum or 500 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure facilities for the center conclude a conference
building and a model factory where practical training in energy
saving will be provided.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's energy demand increases by 7 percent annually
compared to a domestic production surge of only 5 percent, Turkish
Daily News reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Izmir Chamber of Trade Ekrem Demirtas said Monday
that the country is increasingly dependant on imported energy. "The
share of domestic production in energy consumption decreased from
38 percent in 1998 to 35 percent in 1999."
</P>
<P>
He warned that if Turkey does not invest 5 billion U.S. dollars
each year in the energy sector by 2010, the country will be forced
to live in the dark.
</P>
<P>
DUBAI -- Dubai, an emirate of the United Arab Emirates, is eying
for developing a local industry for jewelery based on the lucrative
trade volume of 700 million U.S. dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
About 350 Dubai-based jewelery dealers purchase the luxury items
from Italy, Germany and Holland and sell them at local markets at a
price less 30 to 70 percent than in European markets.
</P>
<P>
They make about 84 million dollars or 12 percent in profits on
an annual basis. There are about 25 jewelry workshops in Dubai.

<HEADLINE> Australian Swimming Star Munz Injured in Car Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Australian swimmer Lori Munz,
gold medalist in the last Commonwealth Games, was injured after a
head-on car crash in Sydney on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic medal contender was taken to hospital in a serious
but stable condition after the accident on the New South Wales
south coast left her with severe leg injuries.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old was due to undergo surgery on both damaged
knees late Tuesday and her chances of making the May 13-20 Olympic
trials in Sydney were considered slim.
</P>
<P>
Before the accident Munz was almost a certainty of selection in
the Olympic team as a vital part of the 4x100 meters and 4x200
women's freestyle relays and possibly as an individual medley
swimmer.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Suspended over Drug Test  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- British athlete Mark Richardson has
been suspended from competition pending a disciplinary hearing
over his positive nandrolone test.
</P>
<P>
UK Athletics made the decision on Tuesday after the 400m runner
's positive random urine test last October and his appearance
before the governing body's drug advisory committee on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting considered whether there was evidence that a doping
offence took place.
</P>
<P>
The committee decided there is a case for 27-year-old
Richardson to answer and UK Athletics have therefore imposed a
suspension.
</P>
<P>
Doubts are growing over the origins of nandrolone, which has
also shown up in samples given by British runners Linford Christie
and Doug Walker.
</P>
<P>
Research by football's world ruling body FIFA found that the
amount of the substance in the body could be affected by stress.
</P>
<P>
Richardson is one of the few men ever to defeat Olympic
champion and world record holder Michael Johnson of the United
States over 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
He revealed details of the positive test last month but has
consistently protested his innocence, citing food substances as
the cause of the failed drug test.
</P>
<P>
"If it can happen to me it can happen to anyone. Athletics is
on the verge of disrepute," said Richardson when he revealed
details of the test last month.
</P>
<P>
"If I was a parent I wouldn't want my kids taking part in a
sport where they can be branded a drugs cheat when they have done
no wrong," he said.

BUCHAREST, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Gabriela Szabo, the
leading women's track athlete in the world last year, said on
Tuesday she would attempt a 1,500-5,000 meters double at the
Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"I have already signed for the 1,500 and 5,000 meter races at
this summer's Olympics," Szabo said.
</P>
<P>
Szabo said her European indoor 3,000m title was no more than "a
training step" in her preparations for the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
Szabo will spend two weeks at a Black Sea resort and another at
a mountain spa in Romania, combining mud baths with hot mineral
water showers to get back into shape, before leaving for a two-
month training spell in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"I want to build my strength in South Africa, where I plan to
run on hills and on rugged terrain, up to 35 kilometers in two
sessions every day."
</P>
<P>
Szabo, 25, who married her coach Zsolt Gyongyossy last year,
said she spends two-thirds of her time sleeping to recover her
strength.

LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Following are the teams and drivers
for 2000 F1 season:
</P>
<P>
McLaren
</P>
<P>
Mika Hakkinen: Finnish, age 31, 14 Grand Prix victories, two-
time defending drivers' champion.
</P>
<P>
David Coulthard: Scottish, age 28, six Grand Prix victories,
fourth last season 48 points.
</P>
<P>
The car: McLaren has been the quickest the last two seasons but
had reliability problems last season.
</P>
<P>
Ferrari
</P>
<P>
Michael Schumacher: German, age 31, 35 Grand Prix victories,
two-time series champion and fifth last season with 44 points.
</P>
<P>
Rubens Barrichello: Brazilian, age 27, no Grand Prix victories,
seventh last season with 21 points.
</P>
<P>

<P>
Heinz-Harald Frentzen: German, age 32, four Grand Prix

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A 306-km-long frozen section at
the lower reaches of the Yellow River has melted and another 912
km-long frozen section at the middle and upper reaches of the
river is expected to melt in a few days.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a 150-km-long icy section of the Yellow River
in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has melted, according to sources
from the water conservancy department of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
But the river still has 690-km-long sections in the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region and Shanxi Province that remain frozen.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River region was in the grips of a cold spell this
winter and ice covered a 1,208-km stretch of the river, China's
second longest, in the Inner Mongolia and Ningxia Hui autonomous
regions and Henan, Shanxi, and Shandong provinces.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to measures taken by water conservancy departments, the
frozen river has caused no serious problems this season.

BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- "The Making of A Hero" by the
Ukrainian writer Nikolai Alexiviq Ostrovsky (1904-36) has become
hugely popular in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The protagonist, Pavel Korqagin is a working class hero devoted
to his country and the revolutionary course.
</P>
<P>
A 20-episode TV adaptation of the novel is now being shown on
China's Central TV Station. The Chinese version of the novel,
published 21 times by 15 different publishing houses, has topped
Beijing's best-seller list for weeks.

<P>
"We almost sold out the novel," said a salesman with the Xidan
Book Emporium, the largest book shop in Beijing. "We have sold
nearly 200 copies in the last week."
</P>
<P>
Local press attributed the popularity of the former Soviet
Union hero to the wide respect among the Chinese for heroism and
patriotism. "For the Chinese, Pavel Korqagin is still alive," said

<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji today
participated in group discussions on the government work report he
delivered Sunday with Gansu, Fujian, Heilongjiang and Ningxia
deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC), in session here
since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During group discussions with deputies from Gansu and Ningxia,
both in northwest China, the premier talked about the strategy to
develop the country's west, saying the strategy, which has been
made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
, has drawn nationwide support and worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
He urged people in the west to seize the rare historic
opportunity and be fully prepared, ideologically, organizationally
and in action for the strategy's implementation. He also called
for a good handling of ethnic minorities-related affairs, saying
that it is an important premise and guarantee for a smooth
implementation of the strategy.
</P>
<P>
When he was with deputies from Fujian and Heilongjiang, Zhu,
who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the Communist
Party of China Central Committee Political Bureau, dwelt on
broadening the implementation of the open policy.
</P>
<P>
"Along with an acceleration of the pace of China's accession to
the World Trade Organization, the country's open policy
implementation is faced with a new situation, new opportunities
and new challenges," he said. "We should seize opportunities and
open wider to the outside world with greater courage and more
vigorous measures so as to enhance the international
competitiveness of the Chinese ecnomy and improve its resistance
against risks."
</P>
<P>
He called for continued crackdowns on economic crimes such as
smuggling and for greater efforts to foster a high ethical
standard among the people.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Researchers Develop New Anti-Cancer Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Medical researchers at the School
of Pharmacy of the Hebrew University are ready for clinical trials
on a very promising new series of non-toxic drugs that have shown
they can halt the spread of metastatic cancer cells in mice.
</P>
<P>
If the clinical trials on humans over a period of three years
prove successful, cancer patients taking the drug could continue to
lead productive lives without suffering severe side effects from
current methods of treatment, the researchers told the local daily
the Jerusalem Post Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chemotherapy is the conventional treatment against metastasis
(the process of the spreading of malignant tumor cells through the
body) and this treatment method can kill most or sometimes all of
the cancer cells, but they usually involve powerful side effects
that reduce the quality of life. But if this method can not destroy
all the cancer cells, so even one can continue multiplying and
reintroduce a cancerous growth.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to prevent metastasis, the Hebrew University
researchers focused their attention on the collagenase enzymes
secreted by the cancerous cells. These enzymes enable the cancer
cells to divide and spread in the body.
</P>
<P>
The researchers discovered substances called matrix metallo-
protease (MMP) that stop the activity of these enzymes by binding
with zinc, thus preventing the cancer cells from wandering via the
blood stream to other parts of the body.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said their formulation is built differently and
has shown no harmful side effects or toxicity in the lab. Since the
drugs would have to be taken on a permanent basis to prevent
metastasis, the lack of toxicity is an important benefit.
</P>
<P>
But the researchers said, the lack of funds may prevent the
holding of clinical test of these drugs.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Guerrillas Kill 2 Pro-Israeli Militiamen in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Hezbollah guerrillas killed two
pro-Israeli militiamen in south Lebanon on Tuesday in their first
attack since the Israeli cabinet on Sunday unanimously voted to
withdraw troops from the occupation zone by July.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here said the Hezbollah fighters ambushed a
patrol in the Hardoan area of the western sector of the Israeli
occupation zone, killing a South Lebanon Army (SLA) militiaman.
</P>
<P>
Later, a roadside bomb was detonated near another SLA patrol on
the road to the village of Houla in the same sector, killing
another SLA militiaman, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah has claimed
responsibility for the two attacks that brought the number of SLA
militiamen killed in south Lebanon to 14 this year. The guerrillas
have also killed seven Israeli soldiers since January.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet agreed on Sunday to pull out its forces from
south Lebanon by July, even if there was no peace agreement with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
self-proclaimed aim of protecting its northern territories from
cross-border guerrilla attacks. Since then, Hezbollah has been
spearheading a war of attrition to oust the Israeli occupation
forces and the Israeli-allied SLA.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah said Monday that it would not forgive the SLA
militiamen after the Israeli withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Australian Women Enjoy Gains Made over Century: Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Australian women are enjoying the
fruits of gains in health, financial security and independence
that would have been unthinkable even 20 years ago, the federal
government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Marking Wednesday's International Women's Day, Status of Women
Minister Jocelyn Newman said the first International Women's Day
of the new century was a time to take stock of all the gains women
had achieved.
</P>
<P>
She said the Howard government had put in place economic
reforms which gave women gains in employment, child care,
superannuation, assistance to families and family law.
</P>
<P>
"So tomorrow, on International Women's Day 2000, we should all
celebrate the great strides we have made for women's health,
financial security, independence and general well-being that we
are now seeing," Newman said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition women's affairs spokeswoman Jenny Macklin also said
Australian women had much to celebrate when considering the major
advances made in the 20th Century.
</P>
<P>
These included women voting for the first time in a federal
election in 1903, the election of the first woman to parliament in
1943, the principle of equal pay for equal work being adopted in
1972 and the passing of the Affirmative Action Act in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Leader Kim Beazley said International Women's Day
had a proud tradition in Australia.
</P>
<P>
"As we enter the new millennium, we can look back on many
improvements in women's lives and victories in many hard-won
fights for equal pay, equal rights and equal dignity over the past
100 years," Beazley said.
</P>
<P>
Women will rally in cities and towns across Australia Wednesday
to celebrate the International Women's Day.

LAGOS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Consultations have begun between
Nigeria and France on the possibility of canceling of the
country's 19 billion U.S. dollar debt owed to Paris Club, French
ambassador to Nigeria, Phillipe Peltier, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria Tuesday quoted the envoy as saying
in the country's capital Abuja that despite religious unrest in
the land, French businessmen were determined to "invest
substantially" in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said both parties were expecting positive results of the
negotiation on the debt reduction by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is owing 19 billion dollars to the Paris Club, of which
France is a key member. The figure accounts for about 70 percent
of Nigeria's external debts officially estimated at 28.6 billion
dollars in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The French envoy, who also said his home government was poised
to assist Nigeria in what he called "massive loot recovery" from

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Oil Workers Start Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Workers in Nigeria's oil sector
began on Monday a nationwide strike, raising fears of a possible
crisis in the oil- rich west African country, reported The
Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Long queues were noticed on Monday at filling stations in
Lagos, when the strike was launched by the Petroleum and Natural
Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) and the
National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted George Bada, Chairman of PENGASSAN Lagos
chapter as saying that the strike was in reaction to a recent
directive from the office of the Secretary to the Government of
the Federation (SGF) to transfer a section of the Department of
Petroleum Resources (DPR) to the Environment Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The SGF last October directed that the environment and safety
unit of the DPR be transferred to the Environment Ministry but
this was rejected by the workers who since then have been making
efforts to have the decision rescinded.
</P>
<P>
The workers in the DPR, who protested with placards, claimed
that they were not adequately consulted before the decision was
made, and therefore called for a reversal of the action.
</P>
<P>
The welfare of workers in Nigeria's oil sector is substantially
higher than that in other sectors.

<HEADLINE> CAAC to Add Lateral Air Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- An official with the Civil
Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said that the sector will
increase lateral air services while reducing those direct flights
on trunk lines which have a limited number of passengers.
</P>
<P>
Bao Peide, deputy director of CAAC, made the remark yesterday
while addressing an ongoing national symposium on operating
strategy for civil aviation. The symposium opened yesterday in
Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Bao explained that adjustment of the irrational structure of
air routes will help improve the efficiency of air service and
help raise economic benefits and competitiveness of airlines and
airports.
</P>
<P>
He called for greater efforts to improve the transfer
capabilities of large airports and arrange flights in a rational
way, so that different flights can be linked up.
</P>
<P>
Bao also stressed the necessity of stepping up creation of
central air service networks and their significance in China's
drive to revive its vast western regions.
</P>
<P>
Central air service networks link cities by joining various
flights at central airports and transfer passengers to continuing
routes.
</P>
<P>
The world's top 20 airlines have all introduced central air
service networks and the world's top 20 airports are all central
air service hubs.
</P>
<P>
Bao suggested that central airports in the cities of Chengdu,
Urumqi, Xi'an, and Kunming be enhanced and feasibility reports
regarding the location of new lateral airports be produced to
facilitate construction.

<HEADLINE> China Oil Products Output Continues to Mount </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- According to the latest figures
from the National Bureau of Statistics, China's oil products
output continued to increase rapidly in January.
</P>
<P>
China produced 3.3 million tons of gas, 5.33 million tons of
diesel oil, and 222,900 tons of lubricating oil in January, a rise
of 7.2, 16.5 and 1.9 percent respectively over the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Because of growing market demand and the slow increase of
production, gas and diesel oil have been in short supply on the
domestic market since the end of last year, as stocks of gas,
diesel oil, and lubricating oil declined sharply, by 13, 10 and 14.
5 percent respectively last year.
</P>
<P>
China's petrochemical and petroleum enterprises have been
working together to raise the output of oil products since the
fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Cutting exports of oil products and guaranteeing crude oil
supplies for refineries will help alleviate this difficult
situation.
</P>
<P>
High crude oil prices on the international market compelled
domestic crude oil producing enterprises to raise their factory
prices, while the stockpiling of gas in some places also caused
some market fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
But experts believe that thanks to the country's strong crude
oil producing potential, the gap will be narrowed soon following
these involved enterprises adjust their production output.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Gaining More Equality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A report released by the National
Bureau of Statistics (NBS) today shows that Chinese women are now
enjoying better life.
</P>
<P>
These days, women are receiving better education, having more
equality with men, and are playing more important roles in
political, economic, and social life, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Among the deputies to the 9th National People's Congress, women
account for 21.8 percent, one percentage point higher than the
previous session, and the proportion of women among the members of
the 9th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference has also risen to 15.5 percent, up six
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
China issued a government regulation on women in 1995, and the
status of women has improved greatly since then.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, more than 3,900 women secured positions in local
governments nationwide, ten percent more than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, more female employees are in sectors
requiring specific skills and greater knowledge, while 330 million,
or 46.7 percent, of the nation's labor force is female.
</P>
<P>
More and more girls are being educated in schools and colleges
and fewer are remaining illiterate.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the life expectancy for Chinese women climbed to
73.1 years in 1998, 3.7 years longer than men, while the mortality
rate for pregnant women declined to 56.2 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the inequality between men and women rendered
Chinese women, especially those in poor families, extremely
wretched, and the government has taken poverty relief as one key
way to improve the lives of the country's women, the bureau said.

<HEADLINE> Wrap-up of FM Spokesman's Remarks Today (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government and people
will never allow any activities aimed at splitting the country and
leading to Taiwan's independence, said Foreign Ministry spokesman
Zhu Bangzao here today at a regular press conference almost
dominated by the topics of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the government has any plan to hold military
exercises in the run-up to the Taiwan election, Zhu said the
mainland is willing to see a proper exertion of legal rights of
the Taiwan people and the expansion of economic and trade links
between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has
the obligation, the determination, and the ability to safeguard
national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Lee Tung-hui's visits abroad, Zhu said that Lee's
political activities in foreign countries in attempt to make two
Chinas, whatever his capacity is, will be rejected and condemned
by the Chinese government and Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also voiced its deep concern over Taiwan's plan to buy
Aegis destroyers from the United States, pointing out the Chinese
government and people are firmly opposed to U.S.' arms sales to
Taiwan, and U.S.' provision of any theater missile defense system
or related technology, equipment, and coordinating system to
Taiwan. Such a position of the Chinese side is steadfast, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
When it comes to the increase in China's defense budget, Zhu
noted that China's defense expenditures will not increase
significantly if no incidents that seriously threaten national
sovereignty or security take place.
</P>
<P>
China is still among the countries with the lowest per capita
defense expenditures, and the proportion of defense expenditures
against China's GDP and national financial expenditures has
actually dropped, despite the continual growth in the sum of
defense budget since the 1980s, he added.

<P>
Current budget is yet to satisfy the financial need for defense
construction and army building in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also informed the press conference of a coming security
dialogue between China and India in Beijing, the first of its kind
on the departmental level, in line with the consensus of the two
countries' foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
China and India are major countries in Asia who are responsible
for the peace and stability in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged India to implement "comprehensively and seriously
" the No.1172 resolution by the United Nations on the South Asian
nuclear issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zhu said that China hopes that relations between the
U.S. and Pakistan would improve.
</P>
<P>
When it comes to Israel's decision to withdraw from southern
Lebanon, Zhu said that China believes it will help accelerate the
process of Middle East peace talks and install peace and stability
in the region as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also reiterated today China's hope to establish ties with
the Vatican, adding the condition that Vatican should sever its so-
called diplomatic ties with Taiwan and stop interfering in China's
internal affairs, especially on the pretext of religious issues.
</P>
<P>
Zhu finally told the press conference that Kim Jong Il, general
secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee,
expressed satisfaction over Korea's relations with China, when
visiting the Chinese embassy in Pyongyang on March 5.
</P>
<P>
Zhu gave no comment on a question about the possibility of Kim'
s visit to China, but said China and Korea enjoy a tradition of
maintaining high-level exchange of visits.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, the voice of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), hails women's long struggle
for emancipation as "having written a glorious chapter of women
freedom activities."
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow's edition of the paper will carry an editorial of
congratulations to all Chinese women on the 90th anniversary of
International Women's Day, which falls tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
"The founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949
eradicated the economic and class bases which caused the
humiliation of women," according to the editorial.
</P>
<P>
It notes that the Party and government have protected women's
rights, and many women have participated in the administration of
state affairs, making great contributions to economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
"The great achievements of Chinese women's activities tells us
that women, accounting for half of the world's population, are the
propellant for social progress, as well as the creator of wealth
and cultivation," continues the editorial.
</P>
<P>
The editorial calls on governments at all levels to pay
attention to women's progress and development, and create a
favorable environment for women's progress and development.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The exchange rate of U.S. dollar against Israel's
shekel Monday dipped below the psychological level of NIS 4.000 at
one point, which is its lowest level since September 1998. The
closing representative rate was later set at NIS 4.001.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts attributed the appreciation of shekel to an inflow
of capital to Israel by foreign investment on the Tel Aviv Stock
Exchange, which requires overseas investors to convert foreign
currency into shekels.
</P>
<P>
Other ones believed the market was also reacting to the cabinet
decision to pull out of south Lebanon by July, which is seen by
many investors as a positive development.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Intel, the world's biggest chip maker, will double
its investment in Israeli hi-tech start-ups next year as part of
its global strategy, a senior manager for Intel's strategic
investments in Israel said.
</P>
<P>
Intel plans to invest in 20 to 24 Israeli start-ups in 2001
compared to only 10 in 1999, the manager said, adding that the
investment will go to such fields as communications, networks,
cordless products, security systems and development of solutions in
optical communications.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- South Korea's multinational conglomerate Hyundai
Group's is looking to expand its local subsidiary's activities
here, a marketing manager of the company told the Jerusalem Post
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the company is interested in investing in local
companies, developing product lines in new areas, and seeking to
establish joint ventures between Israeli companies and its Far
Eastern clients. He also revealed that the investment may amount to
tens of millions of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Microsoft is abusing its monopolistic power to
direct Israeli Web surfers to its new site www.msn.co.il in Israel
as a default home page, local Internet players are charging.
</P>
<P>
The site came on line just days ago, which is the official site
of Microsoft Israel, a joint venture between Microsoft and Internet
Zahav, a leading Internet service provider in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft's browser software is distributed free of charge with
a default home page, which many users either do not know that they
can change it, or do not know how to do so.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- The U.S. government would raise its aid to Yemen this
year to 30 million U.S. dollars with the delivery of 177,000 tons
of wheat, peans, milk powder, a source with the U.S. embassy here
said.
</P>
<P>
Washington also decided to offer Yemen another 4 million dollars
for training courses and scholarships, the source added.
</P>
<P>
The move came before an April visit to Washington by Yemeni
President Ali Abdullah Saleh to gear up bilateral development
cooperation and further enhance U.S. support for the Yemeni
economic reform program.

<HEADLINE> Women Comprise Majority of Medical Students in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Medicine is increasingly become a
female profession in Israel, as 50 to 60 percent of medical
students are women, an Israeli Medical expert has said.
</P>
<P>
While many bright young men who previously would have done into
medicine are now studying computers, the quality of the largely
female student body is no lower now than it was five years ago,
local daily the Jerusalem Post quoted Hebrew University Hadassah
Medical School Dean Gad Glaser as reporting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In Israel, the number of medical students that may be accepted
is set by the state according to the number of physicians currently
in practice. There is now one physician for every 200 Israelis, but
in a decade or so many doctors who immigrated from the former
Soviet Union will be reaching retirement age, and their absence
could cause a shortage of doctors then, Glaser said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the number of 18-year olds willing to sign
up for the military medical student program, in which high school
graduates go to the university to study medicine and then commit
themselves to serve for a number of years as officers of the
defense forces, has fallen to a catastrophic level.

<HEADLINE> Iran-Belgium Trade Ties May Be Hurt by Political Brawl: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Iran-Belgium economic ties may
be severely hurt by the recent row between the two countries over
the allegations leveled against former Iranian president Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani by a Belgian court, the Tehran Times daily said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry has called on the Iranian economic organs
to reconsider their trade relations with Belgium, an official of
the ministry was quoted as saying on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
A Belgian judge recently ordered police to investigate
allegations by an Iranian-born Belgian national that Rafsanjani was
responsible for kidnapping, torture, harassment and psychological
violence perpetrated between April 1983 and February 1989 in Tehran
and two other Iranian cities.
</P>
<P>
The order has invited strong protests from the Iranian
government and political factions, who termed the act as a
politically-motivated plot to tarnish Rafsanjani's image.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said the
Belgian court ruling was an insult to the Islamic republic and the
Iranian nation.
</P>
<P>
Answering a telephone call from his Belgian counterpart Louis
Michel, the minister said that the Belgian court's move was "
insulting, unjustifiable and contrary to international norms and
regulations."
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the issue does not at all represent the view of
the Belgian government, Michel said the aim of his phone call to
Kharrazi was to reiterate Brussels' interest in boosting relations
with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Michel expressed regret over the situation and said that his
government would do its best to solve the problem and inform the
Iranian government of the outcome.
</P>
<P>
Economic ties between both countries enjoyed a growing trend in
recent years, the newspaper said, adding that among the 15 member
countries of the European Union, Belgium has a great volume of
trade exchanges with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also have an active joint Chamber of Commerce.
Between the Iranian calendar years 1374 (March 1995-1996) and 1376
(March 1997-1998), Belgium was one of the five major countries
exporting goods to Iran, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Iran exports carpets, caviar, saffron, electro-motors and
minerals to Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Condemns U.S., Britain for Deliberately Blocking Irrigation Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Minister of Irrigation
Mahmoud Diyab Al-Ahmad has accused the U.S. and Britain of blocking
29 irrigation contracts Iraq signed with foreign companies under
the oil-for-food program, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the minister said that during the sixth phase of
the U.N. program, the U.S. and British delegates at the U.N.
Sanctions Committee premeditated to cripple the implementation of
the contracts under fragile pretexts, aiming to inflict more damage
and harm on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused the U.S. and Britain of impeding the
implementation of the oil-for-food deal by deliberately blocking
the approval of its contracts for purchasing humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Under the humanitarian program now in its seventh phase, Iraq is
allowed to sell certain amount of oil and use part of the revenue,
under U.N. supervision, to buy humanitarian goods for its people,
who have been under stringent sanctions ever since Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by Iraq's health ministry
recently, as many as 1.28 million people, mostly children and the
elderly, have died as a direct result of malnutrition and medical
shortages caused by the decade-long sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Cyclone Steve Creates Flood Havoc in Western Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Twice reformed Cyclone Steve
vented its anger at the northwest of the Western Australia (WA)
state Tuesday, but the category-one storm brought little fury
other than torrential rain as it crossed the coast, a spokeswoman
of the WA Fire and Emergency Services Authority said.
</P>
<P>
Flooding remained the major concern throughout the day, with
the WA Bureau of Meteorology warning there was still a chance
Steve could go out to sea, where it could gain yet another life,
the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Communities across massive areas of WA northwest watched
helplessly as water logging by the relentless rains continued.
</P>
<P>
Emergency services reported only minor storm damage and no
injuries, although a man and his wife had to be rescued after
floodwaters hemmed them in on a dirt track into an isolated
Aboriginal community.
</P>
<P>
"There's no damage - it's absolutely astounding - but there's
now a risk of flooding," she said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Targets 2010 to Meet Standards Requirement as Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is expected to meet
the condition of having at least 6,000 standards to be categorized
as a developed nation by 2010, Science, Technology and Environment
Minister Law Hieng Ding said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has now 2,803 Malaysian Standards covering various
sectors like food, engineering and information technology.
</P>
<P>
But to achieve developed nation status, Malaysia must have at
least 6,000 Malaysian Standards to be able to compete in the
international market, the minister told reporters after a function
here.
</P>
<P>
He was confident that if the Department of Standards Malaysia (
DSM) can develop 1,500 suitable standards during the Eighth
Malaysia Plan period (2001-2005), the country can achieve the goal
by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The DSM was recognized by the International Accreditation Forum
Multilateral Recognition Agreement (IAF-MRA) last September and
with the recognition, all Malaysian products which obtain ISO 9000
certification from the DSM are recognized by the 24 IAF-MRA
members including the European Union, the United States, China,
Japan and Canada, he said.
</P>
<P>
The recognition proves that the DSM is capable of handling
accreditation schemes of international standard, he said, adding
that with more standards relating to international industrial
development, more products in Malaysia would be recognized for
their quality, thus enabling the country to compete in the
international market.

<HEADLINE> Water Sprinklers Required for High-rise Buildings in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 7 (Xinhua) -- All owners of high-rise
buildings in Malaysia's capital city and its surrounding areas are
required to install water sprinklers on their buildings before
April 30 to reduce air pollution.
</P>
<P>
"With the sprinklers, we hope to ease the problem of air
pollution, especially when there's a haze," Science, Technology
and Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding said Tuesday after a
function here.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) would take
action against those who failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
Only six out of about 70 high-rise buildings in the Klang
Valley (Kuala Lumpur and its surrounding areas) has installed
sprinklers which are maintenance-free, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, all the building owners agreed to do
so at a meeting with his ministry officials Monday because the
cost was reasonable.
</P>
<P>
He said each 20-minute spray required about 3,200 liters of
water but the owners need not spray everyday as it would depend on
the weather.
</P>
<P>
The spraying would lower the temperature and clean the air
around the building, the minister said, adding that tests
conducted by the DBKL showed that the temperature could be reduced
by between 3 and 5 degrees Celsius.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Emirs and chiefs from 19 northern
states of Nigeria Monday pledged at a meeting with President
Olusegun Obasanjo to uphold the nation's unity, The Guardian, a
leading Nigerian newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They expressed grave concern over the recent crisis over the
introduction of Islamic Sharia law in some northern states and
were resolved to restore normalcy and boost confidence in the
unity of Nigerians, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The emirs, at the end of their meetings with President Obasanjo
and later with Vice President Atiku Abubakar, issued a communique.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the emirs viewed the events of the
last few days with grave concern, noting that peace and stability
are crucial to any progress and socio-economic development in any
nation.
</P>
<P>
"They therefore resolved to work together to restore normalcy
and provide confidence in the unity and brotherhood among the
people of this country," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the emirs and chiefs of the 19 northern
states appealed to the people of northern states in particular and
the country in general to live with one another in peace and
harmony.
</P>
<P>
They also called on all the communities living in the southern
states to remain in their respective places, assuring them of the
protection of the relevant authorities.
</P>
<P>
Clashes over the implementation of Sharia in certain Muslim
dominated northern states in the past several weeks have killed
hundreds of people.
</P>
<P>
The confrontations around this issue between the Muslim north
and the Christian south in the most populous African country even
threatened to disrupt the country's unity.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Pledges to Stick to its "one China" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government held
Tuesday that the Taiwan problem is China's internal affairs and
Indonesia will stick to its "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
"In this case Indonesia has a foreign policy, namely "one
China" policy, and we deem the Taiwan issue as China's internal
affairs under which we will not make any intervention on that,"
Chairman of House of Representatives Commission I on Security and
Foreign Affairs, Yasril Ananta Baharuddin told Xinhua in an
interview here.
</P>
<P>
On the recent tension between China and its province Taiwan,
he said he hoped both sides will settle their problem with their
own ways in order to avoid military action.
</P>
<P>
"We leave it up to them (the Chinese government and Taiwan
authorities) to solve their problem. And we will not meddle in
their problem, because we also oppose any intervention from
outside on our internal affairs," Baharuddin said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab said the Indonesian
government expected that China and Taiwan could ease tension prior
to the presidential election in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We always expect there will be no tension in this region, we
try to do something to ease the tension, and urge any countries in
this region to eliminate tension which will lead to conflict but
it doesn't mean that we will meddle in the internal affairs of
other countries. We expect both sides (China and Taiwan) to
arrange a reconciliation process," Shihab told reporters before
hearing with commission I.
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Director of Politics at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs Nugroho Wisnumurti also said that the Indonesian
government committed to defending its "one China" policy, hoping
there will be a peace settlement on Taiwan affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We are clear with the 'one China' policy. And we will
maintain that policy. And as to how to settle the Taiwan issue,
that is the Chinese government's business. But of course, we
expect the problem can be handled peacefully as it is important to
maintain stability in this region," Wisnumurti told Xinhua.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Government Proposes Ban on Reprocessing Nuclear Waste Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government has proposed a
ban on reprocessing nuclear waste abroad, Swiss Radio
International reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government also wants to determine whether to lay down a
time-limit for the lifespan of nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
At its weekly cabinet meeting in Bern Monday, the Swiss cabinet
decided to launch a wide-ranging consultation process on a draft
law regulating these issues. It is asking all parties concerned to
give their opinions on the proposals by June 15.
</P>
<P>
Energy Minister Moritz Leuenberger said that the government had
decided to leave open the question of whether to limit the
lifespan of nuclear power stations. He said the other option was
to let the plants operate as long as they were considered safe.
</P>
<P>
Leuenberger said the advantage of laying down a deadline was
that it would make planning easier. On the other hand, he said,
nuclear plants produce energy without emissions of greenhouse
gases.
</P>
<P>
The draft law also foresees a ban on reprocessing nuclear waste,
whether in Switzerland and abroad. It would also forbid
transporting nuclear material containing plutonium by air.

<HEADLINE> China Concerned with Taiwan's Plan to Buy U.S. Destroyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua)-- China today voiced its deep concern
over Taiwan's plan to buy Aegis destroyers from the United States.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the issue at today's routine press conference,
foreign ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said China has taken notice
of recent reports on the planned purchase.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out it is the common aspiration of all the Chinese
people including the Taiwan patriots to realize the complete
reunification of the motherland at an early date. Such a planned
purchase of the Taiwan authorities, which is against the
historical trend and futile, not only harms the relaxation of
cross-straits relations, but is also detrimental to peace and
stability of the Asia-Pacific region. It is doomed to failure, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the Chinese government and people are firmly
opposed to U.S.' arms sales to Taiwan, and U.S.' provision of any
theater missile defense system or related technology, equipment,
and coordinating system to Taiwan. Such a position of the Chinese
side is steadfast, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly demand that the U.S. strictly abide by the three
Sino-U.S. joint communiques and related commitments, and clearly
commit itself not to sell Aegis destroyers and Patriot-III anti-
ballistic system to Taiwan," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the U.S. not to do anything which would lead to
tension between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, obstruct
China's reunification cause and obstruct the steady progress of
Sino-U.S. relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy to Sudan Harry
Johnston has said that the United States is not supporting the
separation of southern Sudan, the Middle East News Agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Johnston, who concluded his three-day visit to Sudan on Monday
night, was quoted as saying that the U.S. calls for self
determination for the people of the southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of his first visit to Sudan since his
appointment last August, the envoy said that it has greatly helped
improve the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Sudan, Johnston met President Omar al-Bashir,
Foreign Minister Mustafa Othman Ismail, Sudanese ministers of
engineering affairs and of justice, chairman of the Advisory
Council for Human Rights, and leading political figures from the
rebellious south.
</P>
<P>
Mustafa Othman Ismail on Monday expressed the hope that
Johnston's visit could accelerate the normalization of ties between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Washington closed its embassy in Khartoum in February 1996 and
moved the staff to Nairobi, Kenya, in the wake of the imposition of
international sanctions on Sudan for failing to extradite
perpetrators of the abortive assassination attempt against Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
Washington, however, sent in 1997 a roving diplomatic mission to
Khartoum but such representation froze after the terrorist attack
on two U.S embassies in east Africa in August 1998, killing 12
Americans among 224 others.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, U.S warplanes bombed a chemical factory near
Khartoum thought to be owned by Osama bin Laden whom Washington
blamed for the embassy bombings and other anti-American activities.
</P>
<P>
The U.S accused Khartoum of fomenting terrorism and condemned
its policy in the protracted civil war between the government and
the southern rebels.

<P>
BANGKOK, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 200 people were rushed to
hospitals after inhaling leaked chemical gas from a plastic plant
in an industrial estate in the eastern Thailand, Thailand News
Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place late Monday night in Rayong Province,
some 200 kilometers east of Bangkok, when some problems occurred
to the power system of the plant and a blackout lasted for a few
minutes, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The blackout caused disruption in the plant's production
process and leak of the gas that spread to a nearby village.
</P>
<P>
About 184 villagers suffering from respiratory problems and
fatigue after inhaling the gas were rushed to nearby hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Some 130 returned home after having physical check while 55
still remain in the hospitals with two in serious conditions.
</P>
<P>
Rayong's deputy governor Anek Kasemsuk was quoted as saying
that the plant had pledged to take all responsibilities of the
incident and that the chemical gas was not a poison one but would
trigger fatigue and respiratory problems temporarily.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Manufacturing Sector Growth Exceeds Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The growth of Malaysia's
manufacturing sector, averaging 17.1 percent a year between 1996
and 1999, was higher than the Second Industrial Master Plan (IMP-2)
(1996-2005) target of 16 percent annually, Deputy International
Trade and Industry Minister Kerk Choo Ting said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The amount of 103.4 billion ringgit (about 27.21 billion U.S.
dollars) in investments in the past four years under review also
exceeded the IMP-2 target of 25 billion ringgit (about 6.578
billion dollars) a year in investments by 3.4 percent, he said in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Between 1996 and 1999, he said 52.2 percent of manufacturing
projects approved in Malaysia was by foreign investors and the
balance by local investors.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector created 313,614 job opportunities
during the period, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The economic crisis, in general, did not prevent IMP-2 targets
from being achieved," he said, adding the IMP-2's success can be
seen in the achievements in the manufacturing sector which
experienced a rebound on increased domestic and overseas demand.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector recorded an annual growth of 30.5
percent last year against a contraction of 13.7 percent in 1998,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The IMP-2 is a long-term plan to develop a competitive
manufacturing sector and among steps taken to put the sector on a
firm footing are easing rules on equity and export in order to
attract greater foreign investments and providing incentives to
attract high-technology and information technology companies, Kerk
said.
</P>
<P>
He said industry cluster reviews under the IMP-2 would continue
to ensure the industries remain competitive.

<HEADLINE> Burundian Negotiators Fail to Agree on Election System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- After winding up their
two-week consultations in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha last
Saturday, all four committees on Burundi conflict failed to reach
consensus on how to get a president who will lead a proposed
transitional government, Tanzania's Guardian newspaper reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There is no consensus among committee members on who will be
president for the transitional government after an agreement to
end the six-year-old civil war in Burundi is signed, the report
quoted sources among the committees as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, all parties in exile want a president
who will head the transitional government to be elected at Arusha,
the venue for Burundi peace talks. But the internal delegations
maintain that serious issues like the presidency must be left to
all Burundians inside the country.
</P>
<P>
All conclusions to be reached at Arusha should be taken back to
 Burundians so as to get their reactions before the agreement was
effected, they said.
</P>
<P>
The committee sources, however, were optimistic that the next
Arusha peace talks scheduled for April might be the last one
before the signing of a peace agreement between the Bujumbura
military government and other warring parties wishing to join the
army.
</P>
<P>
The electoral system is one of the most controversial issues
being disputed among different conflicting groups in the tiny
central African country, because it involves the majority Hutu and
the minority Tutsi agreeing to share power in such a way that
their communities are reassured.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, fighting between Hutu rebels and the
Tutsi-dominated army has killed more than 200,000 Burundians and
uprooted more than 1.2 million others.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Review Telephone Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Telephone charges in Kenya may
drop drastically once the government-run Telkom Kenya reviews its
tariffs to make them competitive as a follow-up to the 50 percent
tariff reduction on mobile telephone last September, an senior
Telkom official has said.
</P>
<P>
Telkom managing director Augustine Cheseren said Monday that
the review is focus on high traffic volume and low tariffs as
opposed to the low volume and high tariffs applied in the past,
local newspapers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the International Telecommunications
Union seminar on costs and tariffs here, Cheseren noted the cost
of providing international communications is decreasing rapidly,
therefore it is important to rationalize our tariffs if we are to
survive.
</P>
<P>
He said his company is undertaking such projects to expand its
network as the upgrading of Kericho international switch, the
second earth station in the country, and the installation of a
new international switch with a capacity of 12,000 circuits.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Minister Musalia Mudavadi for Information, Transport and
 Communication told the meeting that his government is set to
privatize Telkom Kenya where 49 percent of its shares will be
sold to a strategic investor and the remaining 51 percent will be
retained by the government.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Safaricom, a subsidiary of Telkom Kenya,
currently offering mobile services is set ot enter into a joint
venture with Vodafone Air Touch of Britain, and is expected to
compete effectively with other mobile phone operators.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Resume Food Aid to Pyongyang: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary
Mikio Aoki announced Tuesday that Japan would resume its food aid
to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) after a break
of three years.
</P>
<P>
Japan will convey the decision to ship 100,000 tons of rice to
the DPRK through the U.N. World Food Program in a second round of
talks between the two countries' Red Cross societies to be held in
Beijing on Monday, the top Japanese government spokesman told a
news conference here.
</P>
<P>
Aoki said Japan and the DPRK have also agreed in principle to
start negotiations in early April on normalizing diplomatic
relations, and resuming talks that collapsed in November 1992.
</P>
<P>
The two countries plan to hold the first round of the talks in
Pyongyang, the second in Tokyo, and the third in Beijing or
another country, Aoki said.
</P>
<P>
Aoki's announcement came after the food aid plan was approved
by Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its two coalition
partners, the Liberal Party and the New Komeito party.
</P>
<P>
Japan suspended its food aid to Pyongyang shortly after a
rocket launched by the DPRK flew over Japan and fell into the
Pacific Ocean in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK said the rocket was launched to send a satellite into
orbit, but Japan claimed that the launch was for testing a
ballistic missile.

<HEADLINE> Large Ammonite Fossil Found in South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A large piece of fossilized
ammonite, an invertebrate creature believed to have disappeared
with the dinosaur 65 million years ago, was discovered in Heyuan
County of Guangdong Province, south China.
</P>
<P>
At the 20-sq.m. excavation site, Chinese geologists announced
that they could see traces of the world as it was 200 million
years ago. The largest ammonite fossil found at this site has a
diameter of 42 cm.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists figure that these ammonoids date back 185 million
to 190 million years to the Late Jurassic Period.
</P>
<P>
Wearing beautiful chrysanthemum-like shells, ammonoids lived in
a shallow sea and were a close relative of the nautilus and
cuttlefish.
</P>
<P>
Other fossils of ancient sea plants and creatures were also
among the find. The experts said that the discovery provides
important evidence for the study of ancient geography, climate,
environment, biology, and mineral resources in southern China.
</P>
<P>
Heyuan County is one of the most important archeological
research grounds in China, where more than 1,000 fossilized
dinosaur eggs have been unearthed in recent years.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman: No Significant Growth in Defense Expenditures if Nothing Serious Happens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China's defense expenditures will
not increase significantly if no incidents that seriously threaten
national sovereignty or security take place, said a Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Bangzao made the remarks at a regular press conference when
asked to comment on the increase in China's budget for national
defense.
</P>
<P>
Though the defense budget for year 2000, which stands at 120.5
billion RMB, is a bit higher than that of last year, China is
still among the countries with the lowest per capita defense
expenditures, he said.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of defense expenditures against China's GDP and
national financial expenditures has actually dropped, despite the
continual growth in the sum of defense budget since the 1980s, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Current budget is yet to satisfy the financial need for defense
construction and army building in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The construction of national defense in China subordinates the
economic construction in the country, which is a long-term policy,
" he said, adding that the increase will mainly contribute to the
salary of the servicemen, their medical care and housing benefit,
and the living cost of troops stationed in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the central government also allocated 5.6 billion RMB
to the army to compensate for its loss as it is no longer entitled
to own companies, he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Advisory Body Offers Advices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The 3rd session of the Ninth
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) held its second plenary meeting here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting regarded as "the top-level democratic forum,"
twelve members of the committee made public speeches, in which
they offered advices on economic development and other subjects.
</P>
<P>
Noted economist Dong Fureng said that, since a proactive fiscal
policy has its limits in stimulating the economy, it is necessary
to study how to use limited fiscal funds to effectively increase
domestic demand. He suggested opening more areas to private
investment and issuing local government bonds.
</P>
<P>
Another prominent economist Gao Shangquan proposed measures to
meet challenges that would come with China's accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO). The measures include sharpening
the competitive edge of enterprises, accelerating reform in fiscal
and financial systems to ensure adequate economic growth, speeding
up the development of backward western areas, speeding up the
process of urbanization, consolidating the legal foundation for
the development of a market economy, and opening wider to the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yifu, an economist from Beijing University, expressed the
hope that measures should be taken to better attract Taiwan
investors.
</P>
<P>
Other issues spoken upon at the forum included urbanization,
utilization of water resources and agricultural restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee,
attended the meeting today.

<TEXT>
<P>
Zhu Peikang, member of the CPPCC National Committee, told a
host of Chinese and foreign reporters that the strategy is
significant for revitalizing the vast hinterland, which calls for
the mobilization of the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC and non-Communist parties, which have a contingent of
talented professionals and maintain good links with all walks of
life, can play an important role in the implementation of the
strategy, said Zhu, who is also vice-chairman of the Central
Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
Zhu called for drawing on the experience of the eastern areas
when developing the west.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question about ecological protection in western
China, Han Yingxuan, chairman of the provincial CPPCC committee of
Qinghai, in the northwest, said the strategy is aimed at
developing the region in an all-round way. Moreover, eco-
protection in the western region is of great significance to the
sustainable development of the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zongxing, vice-governor of northwestern Shaanxi Province,
said the western region should develop its agricultural sector in
accordance with local geographic and climatic conditions and
resources.
</P>
<P>
Private investment should be encouraged in developing the
western areas, said Liu Yonghao, member of the Standing Committee
of the CPPCC National Committee.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Monday that the gaps
with Syria are not large, but nevertheless there is no certainty
that Israel will be able to reach an agreement with Syria that will
bridge them.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo,
Barak also said that with the Palestinians there are significant
gaps, but that "the familiarity between the sides and the long-
standing relations" could help resolve many of them.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli security authorities suspect that an Israeli settler
from the Gaza Strip helped smuggle the members of the Hamas squad,
who were captured or killed last week in Taibeh, from Gaza through
the safe-passage route to Tulkarm in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israelis, either from the Gaza Strip or from the Negev, are
suspected of actively smuggling Palestinians without permits to
work in Israel into the country, as Israeli cars are rarely checked
at roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian National Authority Monday uncovered a
Hamas "explosives laboratory" in Tulkarm. The lab was probably used
to assemble the bombs that were given to the Hamas squad.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The High Court of Justice Monday rejected a petition filed on
behalf of three soldiers serving in the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
The soldiers' attorney asked the court to order the government
to immediately grant all the SLA members and their families
citizenship, asylum, or a promise that when Israeli troops withdraw
from Lebanon, it will allow anyone who wished to come to Israel to
do so.
</P>
<P>
However, the High Court stated in response that it will not
interfere in the political and diplomatic process and the SLA
petitioners and fellow combatants would have to rely on the
government of Israel, which has promised it would not forsake them.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The opposition Likud party Monday filed a no-confidence
motion to the Knesset (Parliament), following the announcement that
Education Minister Yossi Sarid intends to add the works of
Palestinian poets to Israel's school curriculum.
</P>
<P>
However, Sarid told reporters that "there are 100 Israeli
writers in the curriculum, and there should also have four
Palestinians. We have to know more about them." He also said
ignorance is not the best means for creating a better neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Most of the storm has focused on Sarid's decision to add works
by Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, who is known for his poem
about longing for Palestine statehood and the suffering of
displaced Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> MILF Postpones Peace Talks With Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The peace Talks between the
Philippine government and the rebel group of the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) that were supposed to begin Tuesday were
reset to a still undetermined day next week, Philippine News
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The MILF asked for the postponement of the negotiations as
fighting continued in Carmen, Cotabato province in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Mohaqher Iqbal, MILF information officer, said the renewed
armed clashes in Carmenhad already left nine of their men dead. "
But the government side also suffered heavy casualties," he
claimed.
</P>
<P>
At around 4 a.m. Sunday, suspected MILF rebels ambushed a
military jeep, killing on the spot an army major and five of his
men in a village in Carmen, a report from the MILF said.
</P>
<P>
But military officials denied the report, saying only one
soldier was slightly wounded in the attack.
</P>
<P>
The continued fighting in Carmen led the MILF to accuse once
more the government of violating the truce.
</P>
<P>
Iqbal said the talks' suspension was called for by the MILF "
because we do not know whom to talk to."
</P>
<P>
As this developed, Defense Undersecretary Orlando Soriano was
replaced by retired Southern Command chief Eduardo Batenga as
government chief negotiator to the talks.
</P>
<P>
This announcement was made by Maguindanao Governor Zacaria
Candao who stressed that the move was in consonance with President
Joseph Estrada's vision of charting a new direction for the
negotiations and at the same time hastening its finalization.
</P>
<P>
The president had earlier given government and MILF peace
brokers up to June this year to wrap up their talks.

<HEADLINE> EU Grants Tanzania $ 42 Million on Road, Tax Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 7 (Xinhua) - The European Union has agreed
to grant a total of 42 million euro (42 million U.S. dollars) to
fund Tanzania's southern transport program and Tanzania Revenue
Authority's tax administration projects.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Monday after the signing ceremony of two financing

Under the agreement, Mwanza Region Transport Program was
allocated 35 million euro to upgrade and rehabilitate a total of
2,700 kilometers of road network in the region.
</P>
<P>
The EU signed the southern regions roads rehabilitation and
upgrading program in February 1998 with Tanzania but
implementation was put on hold because of the government's
reluctance to incorporate the private sector in road management.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Fish Samples Pass EU Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The fish samples sent by Uganda
have finally passed the repeated laboratory tests of the European
Union (EU), leading to an EU declaration that Ugandan fish is fit
for human consumption.
</P>
<P>
The fish samples were sent in for test four weeks ago, said a
report by Monitor, a Ugandan newspaper on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With the declaration by the 15-member European bloc, the EU is
likely to lift the ban very soon it imposed on Ugandan fish early
last year. But the report quoted an official from Ugandan Ministry
of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries as saying that
exporters should wait for formal clearance.
</P>
<P>
The test results could help recapture the confidence of the
European market and boost the country's sluggish fish product
exports, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The EU slammed the ban on Ugandan fish after incidents of fish
poisoning which led to deaths and serious illnesses among
consumers were reported. Unhygienic conditions at the landing
sites is also said to be one of the main reasons of the ban.
</P>
<P>
The EU is the biggest buyer of Ugandan fish outside the
country. The fish ban has reportedly made the African country
lose 72 million U.S. dollars each year and forced many of the
700,000 Ugandan people who depend on fishing industry for living
to either stay idle or shift to other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Fish export is now the second largest foreign exchange earner
in Uganda, following coffee which accounts for 60 percent of the
country's total foreign exchange income.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Airways Implements Expansion Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- With passengers growing at 30
percent in last two years on African regional routes and 5-8
percent on inter- continental routes, Kenya Airways is
implementing its ambitious expansion programs.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Airways is to double passenger capacity on African
regional routes and expand at least 30 percent on European and
Middle East routes over the next three years, Tuesday's Daily
Nation newspaper quoted the airline's technical director Steve
Clarke as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The airline will buy three Boeing 767-300 ER and three Boeing
767-400 ERX between the summer 2001 through to year 2004," Clarke
announced Monday here.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, at least four Boeing 737-700 jets will join Kenya
Airways fleet between June 2001 and February 2003," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clarke also revealed that the company would replace the Airbus
301 jets in order to provide more space and better in-flight
(audio and video) entertainment systems for customers.
</P>
<P>
The airline, with a staff of 2,800, was planning for a five
percent staff recruitment annually and over 800 people would be
employed in the next five years, Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Airways, the biggest airline in the sub-Saharan Africa,
boasted an enviable safety record until one of its Airbus 310 jets
crashed off the coast of Cote d'Ivoire in January, killing 169
people on board.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is drawing
up a poverty reduction program to meet the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) conditions for qualifying for relief under the Highly
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, the Times of Zambia
newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Finance Deputy Minister Newton N'guni as
saying on Monday that the government is in the process of
organizing a national conference at which views from stakeholders
would be incorporated into the poverty reduction program.

considered for adoption," N'guni said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is awaiting an IMF mid-term review
decision on the Poverty Reduction Growth Facility which would give
the final direction that HIPC initiative would take for Zambia.
</P>
<P>
According to N'guni, the IMF wanted an interim Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper containing the government's statement of
its commitments to poverty reduction.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Seeks to Remove Obstacles for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is committed
to removing the obstacles that make the participation of women in
national matters impossible through education, Education Minister
Godfrey Miyanda has said.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks while addressing an international
 conference attended by education ministers and representatives
from nine African countries focusing on the Strategic Resource
Planning here on Monday, local media reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank's statistics released during the
conference, there had been more than 150 million children aged
between six and 11 out of school and that 60 percent were girls,
with 12 percent of them being Africans.
</P>
<P>
Inefficiencies in education management, especially in the
post-secondary sectors and in teaching staff management still
persisted and that if the current trend continued, 75 percent of
the worldwide out-of-school children will be in Africa by the year
2015, said Elizabeth Mumba, Deputy Chancellor of University of
Zambia, at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Mumba noted that increased access to school and improved
quality of education had been hindered by several factors.
</P>
<P>
She cited rising education costs, school and home based
cultural factors and the impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic as the
main hindrances for children, especially girls in Africa to secure
access to education.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the education ministers and representatives
from nine participating countries is an indication of the
commitment that the governments have been taking in the
implementation of education reforms, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the objective of the reforms is to increase
opportunities for girls to access quality education, remain in
school and be prepared to enter the labor force.

<HEADLINE> North China Province to Reconvert Farmland into Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 16,600 hectares of farmland
will be reconverted to forests this year in ten counties of north
China's Shanxi Province on the middle and upper reaches of the
Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Most of these counties are mountainous and suffer from serious
soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
With the development of agriculture, the people there basically
have enough food, and reconverting farmland into forests will not
have much negative effect on their lives, according to the
provincial government.
</P>
<P>
The province will also plant trees and grass on around 66,600
hectare of barren areas.
</P>
<P>
People who reconvert their farmland into forest will receive
subsidies and tree seedlings provided by the government.
</P>
<P>
Protecting and building the ecological environment is an
important integral part of the Chinese government's strategy of
developing the vast, economically backward western regions of the
country, according to the government work report delivered by
Premier Zhu Rongji at the opening session of the ongoing National
People's Congress.

<HEADLINE> Expert: Kidney-Nourishing Herbs Effective in Slowing Aging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Traditional Chinese kidney-
nourishing herbs can prolong life and retard aging, according to
one Chinese medical researcher.
</P>
<P>
Shen Ziyin, professor at a medical research institute attached
to Huashan Hospital in Shanghai, made a 40-year study of the
relationship between the kidneys and aging, and found that kidney
deficiency is the fundamental cause of human aging.
</P>
<P>
According to medical theory accepted internationally, aging is
closely related to the weakening or disappearance of T-lymphocyte
in the human body.
</P>
<P>
Nourishing the kidneys with traditional Chinese herbs can slow
down the decay of T-lymphocyte, thus retarding the aging process,
Shen said.
</P>
<P>
He said the concept of the kidneys in traditional Chinese
medicine includes the nervous system and the internal secretion
and immune systems.
</P>
<P>
Nourishing the kidneys will readjust the three systems and keep
them healthy and balanced to prevent disease and aging, he added.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Professor Shen made several experiments on a
group of 18-to-24-month-old rats by feeding them regularly with
two formulas of kidney-nourishing herbs.
</P>
<P>
The results showed that the cell death rate in these kidney-
reenforced rats was much lower than among their peers, and close
to that of young rats, and they are healthier than the rats who
were not given the formula.
</P>
<P>
Professor Shen said he will continue his research on the
relationship between the kidneys and aging, and provide more
scientific evidence to support his theory.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), joined a
group discussion today with Hong Kong deputies to the NPC, in
session here since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The top lawmaker, who is a member of the Standing Committee of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Political
Bureau, exchanged views with Hong Kong deputies on a number of
issues.
</P>
<P>
Li agreed with some Hong Kong deputies that inter-parliamentary
exchanges are a key component of China's diplomacy, saying that
the NPC has set up bilateral friendship groups with parliaments of
more than 50 foreign countries. To include Hong Kong deputies into
these groups is a way for them to take part in the administration
of state affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
The NPC leader also aired his views on environmental protection,
the strategy to develop the country's west in a big way, China's
accession to the World Trade Organization, the security of the
banking industry and computer networks, and reform of state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Li praised the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, headed by chief executive Tung Chee Hwa,
for its effective administration over the region since Hong Kong's
return to its motherland on July 1, 1997. The whole world has
witnessed that, in quite a short period of time, the SAR
government has got over serious economic difficulties and
maintained economic prosperity and social stability.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng encouraged Hong Kong deputies to speak out what they
want to say, discuss state affairs with other deputies and make
greater contributions to the country.

KAMPALA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Planned investment officially
licensed by Ugandan investment authority has risen to 874 million
U.S. dollars in 1999, representing a 159-percent increase over
that registered in the previous year, a report has indicated.
</P>
<P>
According to the Uganda Investment Authority (UIA) annual
report received here on Tuesday, the ratios of planned investments
versus the number of projects indicates 1999 as the best year,
which points to a growing trend toward fewer but better quality
investment in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Although only 64 projects were licensed in 1999 compared with
136 in 1998, the value of planned investments in 1999 has more
than doubled the total sum of 337 million dollars realized in
1998, the report said.
</P>
<P>
UIA was established in 1991 and has since licensed up to 2,085
projects with planned investments worth 4.7 billion dollars and

NAIROBI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- African countries cannot develop
their fledging economies unless they are freed from the crushing
foreign debt burden, said Kenyan Vice President George Saitoti on
Monday at a meeting between the World Bank officials and church
leaders from Africa.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by local newspapers as saying that the
continent's precarious financial situation has been exacerbated by
the fact that 40 percent of its export earnings are channelled
toward servicing debt.
</P>
<P>
The lifting of the debt burden should be accompanied by the
infusion of accountability and transparency in the fiscal
management of African economies, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Saitoti, corruption, HIV/AIDS, war and civil
strife, a reduction of donor funding and an outflow of foreign
investment also caused a slow-down in Kenya's economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Seoul to Issue Bonds to Stabilize Foreign Exchange Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korea announced Tuesday that
it will soon issue bonds worth one trillion won (about 893 million
U.S. dollars) to stabilize the foreign exchange market due to the
won's appreciation.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Finance and Economy Ministry said in a
statement that the timing of the issuance will be decided in light
of the bond market situation.
</P>
<P>
The ministry issued foreign exchange stabilization bonds valued
at 700 billion won (about 625 million dollars) late last month.
</P>
<P>
Owing to a large-scale influx of foreign capital into the stock
market, the South Korean government has been paying great
attention to the uncertainty of the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Foreign net purchases of stocks reached five trillion won (
about 4.5 billion dollars) this year as of last Monday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement is seen as a sign that the government will
intervene in the foreign exchange market directly.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts foresaw no continuous downward movements of the
won's exchange rate against the greenback, but said an additional
demand for three billion U.S. dollars, including two billion would
be needed to repay Daewoo's overseas creditors.

BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Recent acute solar motion may be
harmful to people, today's Beijing Morning Post cited one expert
as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Guiqing, senior staff member of the Beijing
Solar Motion Monitoring Center, solar motion is now in a peak
period, one that occurs every 11 years, and the solar wind will
have some influence on power supplies and communications systems
on earth.
</P>
<P>
"Two huge sunspot groups, each larger than the earth and
visible to the naked eye, have appeared on the surface of the Sun,
" Zhang was cited as saying.
</P>
<P>
Because the influence of solar wind on the human body has not
been scientifically determined, the newspaper said, it is better
for a person not to open to blazing sun for too long.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand PM to Push New Links with L. America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Helen Clark will leave for Chile on Thursday to attend the
inauguration of President Ricardo Lagos Escobar.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued Tuesday by the New Zealand
government, the prime minister, during her stay in Santiago, will
have discussions with Latin American leaders on how their
countries and New Zealand can cooperate more closely on a range of
issues, including disarmament, environmental issues and trade.
</P>
<P>
Helen Clark said in the press release that the inauguration
presents her with an ideal opportunity to meet not only Chile's
new president, but also a number of other important regional and
international figures, including the new presidents of Argentina
and Uruguay, the president of Brazil, ministers from other Latin
nations including Peru and Mexico, and the prime ministers of
Italy and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
"This visit offers an opportunity to advance discussions in a
number of areas. The New Zealand government is keen to bring new
momentum to international efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons. In
recent years, we have worked closely with Brazil and Mexico on
disarmament issues. I would like to discuss these issues with like-
minded leaders and ministers while in Chile, and look in
particular at how we can coordinate disarmament efforts in fora
like the United Nations," Miss Clark said.
</P>
<P>
"There are also important environmental issues before us. New
Zealand would like work closely with Latin American countries on
issues such as fisheries, whaling, and the Antarctic," she added.
</P>
<P>
Helen Clark said the attendance at President Lagos'
inauguration is a "good opportunity to begin expanding New Zealand
's existing links with Latin America, and to lay the foundations
for on-going dialogue in the future."
</P>
<P>
According to the New Zealand prime minister, the trade between
New Zealand and Chile totaled 40 million U.S. dollars in the year
from July 1998 to June 1999, and New Zealand investments in Chile
top 500 million U.S. dollars. New Zealand trade links with Latin
America have grown steadily since the mid-1990s, with New Zealand
exports rising from 295 million U.S. dollars in 1995 to 375
million U.S.dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We will look at ways in which the trading relationship with
Chile and other Latin American countries can be further encouraged,
" Helen Clark Said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand PM Calls for Nuke-Free Zone in S.  hemisphere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Helen Clark is renewing New Zealand's call to push for the
Southern Hemisphere to become a nuclear-weapons-free zone.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post Tuesday quoted the prime minister as saying
she would raise the issue of creating closer links between the
world's nuclear-free zones, which together cover most of the land
masses of the Southern Hemisphere, when she visits Chile this week.
</P>
<P>
Helen Clark said her country is interested in disarmament and
will work with other countries on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper last month reported that New
Zealand Minister for Disarmament and Arms Control Matt Robson
planned to push the idea of a Southern Hemisphere Nuclear-Weapons-
Free Zone when he attends a disarmament conference in Geneva later
this month.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand is part of the South Pacific Nuclear-Weapons-Free
Zone, as a signatory to the Treaty of Rarotonga. Other nuclear-
free zone treaties are the Treaty of Tlatelolco, covering the
Latin American and Caribbean region, the Treaty of Pelindaba,
covering the African continent, and the Treaty of Bangkok,
covering Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand has worked for some years to bring to the UN
General Assembly a resolution supporting closer links between
these zones, leading to the Southern Hemisphere becoming a nuclear-
weapons-free zone.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Launches School Internet Safety Kit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Guidance designed to prevent
school children accessing pornography and bomb recipes on the
Internet are being launched Tuesday in Auckland, the largest city
of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported Tuesday that the guidelines were developed
by a conglomerate of community and government agencies and will be
distributed to schools across the country.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for the Internet Safety Group, Liz Butterfield,
was quoted as saying the resource kit aims to keep children away
from websites containing questionable material and to make it more
difficult for paedophiles to contact children online.
</P>
<P>
Ms Butterfield said the extent of these problems in New Zealand
is not known, but since 1996 a quarter of those caught dealing in
child pornography have been adolescents.
</P>
<P>
She said most children will be able to access the Internet at
school by the end of this year and children need to know how to
use it safely.
</P>
<P>
Measures outlined in the kit include schools appointing an
Internet safety officer and the holding of Internet education
evenings for parents.

<HEADLINE> AMD Beats Intel In Commercializing 1st Gigahertz Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Computer chip maker Advanced
Micro Devices (AMD) has once again taken the lead in the ongoing
microprocessor-speed race with its powerful rival Intel by
commercializing the fastest processor ever available on the market,
AMD said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Athlon processor, which operates at one Gigahertz, or 1
billion cycles per second, will be shipped in volume to Compaq and
Gateway, AMD said.
</P>
<P>
"Attaining the 1 Gigahertz performance mark has long been a
paramount goal for producers of PC processors," said W.J. Sanders
III, AMD's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, AMD has been in fierce competition with
Intel in this field. However, despite some of the achievements,
analysts pointed out that AMD's faster chips had not been widely
available on the market.
</P>
<P>
Compaq said Monday it would sell computers with AMD's one
Gigahertz chip at prices ranging from 2,000 dollars to 3,300
dollars, with the average price around 2,499 dollars. Customers
can begin placing orders on March 9, and delivery will be within
four or five days.
</P>
<P>
Gateway said prices for one Gigahertz system would start at 2,
999 dollars. It will begin selling products in 8 to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
AMD said it also planned to ship the high-speed chips to all
other computer makers in April, with a price of 1,299 dollars in 1,
000 unit quantities.
</P>
<P>
"At a psychologically important speed level, they've beaten
Intel to the punch," said A.A. Lafountain, a semiconductor analyst
at Needham &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
"they've not only gotten out there with a working product, the
fact that they've been able to simultaneously announce volume
shipments to some leading PC vendors means that this is a far
different situation from a year ago when they either couldn't ship
the parts," Lafountain added.
</P>
<P>
Reaching the Gigahertz milestone first also adds credibility
to AMD, which investors until recently may have seen as on a
different playing field, according to Jack Geraghty of Gerard
Klauer Mattison.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, AMD was like the 'second cousin' to Intel, with
the lower quality chip," Geraghty said. "Now they've got something
ahead of Intel, same level, same pricing and can say now that they
are on an equal plane with them."
</P>
<P>
Intel provides the brainpower for nearly 90 percent of the
world's computers, but it has been locked in a race with AMD to
market faster chips.
</P>
<P>
"AMD puts the heat on Intel, and that's good for the consumer
because they get more processing power and lower prices," said
analyst David Wu at ABN Amro.
</P>
<P>
Intel says it will introduce its own Pentium III Gigahertz chip
soon though it was set not to begin shipping in quantity until
fall. The code-named "Willamette" chip, unveiled in February,
operates at a speed of at least 1.5 Gigahertz.

<HEADLINE> Study: Asia-Pacific E-Commerce Reaching Critical Mass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 6 (Xinhua) -- With more than 10 million
consumers having already bought online, and with Internet use
surging, the Asia-Pacific online retail market is reaching
critical mass, according to a report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the tremendous diversity in the region, said the report
from U.S. research firm Boston Consulting Group, the online retail
market is still highly concentrated, with the leading 25 players
in most countries accounting for more than 60 percent of overall
revenue.
</P>
<P>
Total online retail revenue in Asia-Pacific was 2.8 billion U.S.
dollars in 1999, according to the report, compared with 3.5
billion dollars in Europe and 36.6 billion dollars in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Growth potential is high, with online retail penetration of the
region's total retail sector only 0.1 percent compared with 1.2
percent in the United States. Online retail revenue in the region
is expected to reach more than 7 billion dollars in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Japan, South Korea and Australia accounted for 92 percent of

<HEADLINE> Striking Union Snubs Boeing Latest Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Striking engineers and
technicians did not return to their jobs Monday following Boeing's
imposition of part of its latest contract offer on them, according
to reports from the Seattle-based company.
</P>
<P>
Charles Bofferding, executive director of the Society of
Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), said he
did not know of any workers who went back to work.
</P>
<P>
Boeing spokesman Peter Conte also said there was no significant
increase in the number of SPEEA workers on the job Monday.
</P>
<P>
SPEEA said that while the wage move showcases the most
attractive part of Boeing's proposal, more objectionable parts are
sure to follow if enough workers return to work.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly we believe it's an attempt to implement the good
things and hold off on the not-so-good things until people come
back," union spokesman Bill Dugovich said.
</P>
<P>
SPEEA, which has struck for more than three weeks over pay and
benefits issues, stressed that it believed all of the 18,000
striking engineers and technicians had remained off the job,
despite Boeing's offer on Sunday to implement wage increases for
those who returned to work.
</P>
<P>
"We have no indication that anybody went back to work Monday,
which is a clear indication that people are tired of being bullied
and scared by this company," Dugovich said.
</P>
<P>
A Boeing spokesman indicated that the company may have to hire
more temporary workers or switch work to other areas of the
company to cope with the effects of the strike.
</P>
<P>
The wage increases were part of Boeing's last proposal that
grants a 3-percent hike to engineers over three years and
guarantees a 2-percent-annual hike for technicians. It also
increases the funds available for raises for both groups.
</P>
<P>
SPEEA says the new wages hikes were still below market levels
and did not do enough to guarantee raises for individuals. Under
the current proposal, certain groups of workers could receive big
raises while other groups get none.
</P>
<P>
"We're not coming back until they sit down at the table with us
and negotiate this contract," said Tom McCarty, a member of the
engineering negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
The union, which went on strike on February 9, has sought more
guaranteed pay raises and bonuses, like those received by
production workers represented by the Machinists, Boeing's largest
union.
</P>
<P>
SPEEA, representing engineers earning an average 63,000 dollars
a year and technical workers averaging 45,000 dollars a year, has
rejected two previous contract proposals since December.
</P>
<P>
The strike has caused snarls in Boeing's commercial jet
production and defense projects. Boeing said last Thursday it had
delayed 15 of 42 aircraft deliveries planned for February.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Continues to Slip in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Vietnam did
not pick up in the first two months of this year, the latest local
newspaper Vietnam Investment Review reported.
</P>
<P>
Just 28 foreign projects were licensed or permitted to increase
investment in the first two months of the year, according to
figures released by Vietnam's Ministry of Planning and Investment
(MPI).
</P>
<P>
New or increased investments totaled 78 million U.S. dollars,
just 19 percent of the capital registered in the first two months
of 1998, according to MPI statistics.
</P>
<P>
Newly-licensed foreign direct investment (FDI) projects in
January and February accounted for 57.6 percent of the FDI
projects licensed over the same period last year, the figures
showed.
</P>
<P>
Realized investment capital in the first two months of this
year stood at 200 million U.S. dollars, a 33 percent increase on
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Realized investments, however, totaled just 12.5 percent of
initial expectations.
</P>
<P>
The report from the MPI added that industrial production in the
foreign sector had also dropped due to the fall in overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
In response, Vietnam Investment Review said, Vietnamese
government officials promised to halt the downward slide. They
pledged to amend the law on foreign investment and hold a series
of meetings with foreign investors in order to better furnish the
investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Vietnam had 398 foreign investment projects licensed
or permitted to increase investment with the total registered
investment capital of 2.3 billion U.S. dollars, dropping by 57.45
percent against 1998.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Official on Int'l Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- "Without the presence of power
equilibrium, the international situation has assumed a unipolar
stance and a group of nations is trying to dominate the world by
using their political, economic, diplomatic and military might,"
said a high-ranking Myanmar government official.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here Monday at the opening of the Conference of Heads
of Mission of Myanmar Embassies, Permanent Missions and Consulates-
General, Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the
Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, charged that these
nations are blatantly abusing and violating norms of international
relations and are openly interfering in the internal affairs of
other nations by using human rights, democracy and other pretexts.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, who is also Chairman of Myanmar's Foreign Affairs
Policy Committee, cited instances of ignorance of the U.N. Charter
and International Law and commitment of armed aggression against
sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
"Although the western media have deliberately tried to paint a
very bleak picture of Myanmar, although some big western nations
are continuing to give pressure against Myanmar in many ways and
are interfering in the internal affairs of the country, the
reality is that the nation is not encountering unrest and
disturbances," he commented.
</P>
<P>
He objected to accept attempts at interfering in the internal
affairs of Myanmar, saying that the future of Myanmar must be
decided by Myanmar people themselves.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is now over 10 years since the western nations
have imposed economic embargo against Myanmar in order to pressure
it with the belief that it will result in the collapse of the
country's economy and that Myanmar will be forced to follow their
lead.
</P>
<P>
In fact, he pointed out, the Myanmar people become more united
in times of crisis, saying that the more pressure, the more united.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Myanmar is determined to play a more
meaningful role in the world, while maintaining the basic
principles of Myanmar's independent and the active foreign policy
including development of friendly relations with all countries in
the world.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the importance of the participation in
United Nations and other international and regional organizations
as well as the ties with neighboring countries in accordance with
the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that Myanmar would increase the momentum of external
relations and launch an effective diplomatic offensive.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Myanmar's internal affairs, Khin Nyunt said the
government has opened the door to peace to the remaining anti-
government armed groups which have not yet made peace with the
government, hoping that they will response to the peace call.
</P>
<P>
He called on all the national races in Myanmar to work together
with the union spirit and in unity for the progress and
development of the nation.
</P>
<P>
The conference is the first ever one of its kind held in
Myanmar since 1963 to review some of the main features in the
world today and their implications on Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> 3 Illegal Immigrants Freeze to Death in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Three illegal immigrants died
after being caught in a winter storm in the mountains inside of
Southern California and local authorities were searching Monday
for others at risk from the cold.
</P>
<P>
With the three deaths, a total of 16 immigrants have died so
far this year in California while illegally entering the state
along its 230-kilometer border with Mexico, according to Claudia
Smith, executive director of the California Rural Legal Assistance
Foundation, an immigrant rights group.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the three men were pulled Monday from the snow-
frosted mountains of the Cleveland National Forest, local
officials said, adding the forest, away from the east of San Diego,
has become a busy corridor for illegal immigration from
neighboring Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Sick and cold illegal immigrants stumbled out of the Laguna
Mountains all day Monday after a weekend storm dumped 15 to 20
centimeters inches of snow, they added.
</P>
<P>
Five men and four women were found suffering from hypothermia
Monday morning, and at least three other immigrants remained in
the mountains, Border Patrol spokesman Gloria Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
Thirty people as of Monday afternoon had been rescued and taken
to hospitals for treatment or evaluated while in the custody of
immigration authorities, who said local authorities were still
searching for others.
</P>
<P>
Smith blamed the latest three deaths on Operation Gatekeeper, a
U.S. border crackdown that began in 1995 and pushed illegal
immigration away from San Diego and east into the mountains and
deserts.
</P>
<P>
"It is a strategy that is going to keep killing people
regardless of search and rescue efforts," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
The Hispanic population in America is exploding, from 22.4
million in 1990 to an estimated 30.3 million in 1998. Local
officials say that some of the Hispanic population in the United
States are illegal immigrants.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Recruit 2,500 Tamil Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has issued a directive to recruit 2,500 Tamil teachers
before June in a bid to fill vacancies, a Presidential Secretariat
statement said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The president's directive follows a discovery that there were
vacancies for 4,000 Tamil teachers in government schools.
</P>
<P>
Of these 2,500 teachers, half will be sent to schools in the
Northern and Eastern provinces where the minority Tamils
concentrate and the other half to provinces where vacancies exist,
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Vacancies for Tamil teachers are expected to rise under a new
language teaching program implemented from January this year.
</P>
<P>
The National Education Commission has initiated the program as
a means of national reconciliation between Sinhalese and Tamils,
the two main ethnic groups constituting respectively 74 percent
and 18 percent of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the teaching of the mother language and
English will commence from grade 1 and the teaching of Sinhala and
Tamil to other communities from grade 3.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 17-year-old war between the
Sinhalese majority-controlled government troops and Tamil Tiger
rebels who want to carve out a Tamil state in the north and east
of the country.

<HEADLINE> Second Global Knowledge Conference Kicks off in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The second Global Knowledge
Conference (GKII) kicked off here Tuesday to explore ways to
bridge the growing information divide.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi addressed
the opening plenary of the four-day GKII Tuesday. However, the
conference will be officially opened Wednesday by Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah stressed the need for a concerted effort at forging a
sincere, smart global partnership to ensure that the new global
knowledge economy, characterized by globalization and the digital
revolution, will benefit the greatest number of people possible.
</P>
<P>
"We must endeavor to find a common understanding rooted in
fairness and equity which will put into perspective the global
transition that is taking place," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The developing world has a right to voice our skepticism about
this brave new world," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said: "While we remain at the forefront of efforts to forge
a new global understanding based on justice and equity, we also
believe that efforts must be made toward transforming our own
economy into a knowledge-based economy."
</P>
<P>
For developing countries to survive, he said they must not
merely point their fingers at the global economic system, but must
also shoulder the responsibility of building more competitive and
resilient economies.
</P>
<P>
The challenges that lie ahead for the global community are
certainly daunting but by no means insurmountable, he said, adding
what is needed to ensure the emergence of an equitable global K-
economy is the sharing of responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
The conference aims to help bring the benefits of the
information age to everyone, and to provide a forum for
participants from all over the world to examine the challenges of
harnessing information and knowledge as tools for development,
according to organizers.
</P>
<P>
The conference with a theme "Building Knowledge Societies" is
going to focus on three critical challenges: assuring universal
access to information and communications technologies (ICT),
identifying strategies and tools to help empower individuals and
communities to improve their lives at every level, and exploring
ways in which new technologies can enable more efficient,
transparent and participatory forms of governance, they said.
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the conference, a Youth Forum, a Women's
Forum and a Media Forum are being held with representatives of
each of these groups expected to input their thoughts and ideas
into the conference after deliberating on fresh opportunities and
benefits offered by wider access to information and knowledge and
its impact in the community, in education, in business and on the
quality of life.
</P>
<P>
A Knowledge Fair and study visits to enable participants to see
first hand successful ICT projects in host Malaysia are arranged
throughout the conference period.
</P>
<P>
The conference, sponsored by the government of Malaysia and the
Global Knowledge Partnership (GKP) which evolved out of the first
Global Knowledge Conference in Canada in 1997, brought together
over 1,000 participants from the public and private sectors, non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) and international bodies.
</P>
<P>
The GKP, comprising 59 member organizations including national
governments, international organizations, corporations and NGOs,
is working to improve access to ICT for people in developing
countries so that they can gain knowledge that will help them
improve their lives.

<HEADLINE> 30 Newly Elected Thai Senators to be Disqualified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 7 (Xinhua) --The Election Commission of Thailand
has put at least 30 newly elected senators on a potential
disqualification list over allegations they were involved in fraud,
which could delay the official announcement of winners until March
21.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's The Nation quoted commissioner Sawat Chotepanich as
saying that "thirty candidates face investigation for sure."
</P>
<P>
"They will be disqualified if the probe confirms allegations we
received," he added.
</P>
<P>
Most of the senators elect facing investigation won seats in
the Northeast, and some were among those who received the most
votes, according to Sawat.
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest scandals is in the Northeast province of
Nakhon Ratchasima. The commission's provincial branch has reported
that five of the eight senators elected there should be
disqualified, said Sawat.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the process to fully review the election
and scrutinize reportedly alleged frauds and irregularities to
ensure free and fair votes was underway, and was expected to be
completed and finally announced by the time the current Senate's
term ends on March 21.
</P>
<P>
As of last night, results from 76 provinces had been handed
over. The commission will consider all complaints filed against
individual candidates, who would have a chance to deny the
allegation and clear themselves.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's first democratic Senate election ended Saturday,
with an unexpectedly high voting rate.
</P>
<P>
The election is the first one since Thailand adopted
constitutional rule 68 years ago and is widely seen as first test
of the country's political reform under its 1997 constitution.
</P>
<P>
Under the new charter, senators will be elected, rather than
hand-picked by the prime minister, and will be entitled with more
substantial power than their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
So the competition for the 200 seats in the upper house turned
out to be quite fierce.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Mayon Evacuees Head Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of villagers ignored he
danger of eruptions and made their way back to their homes under
the Mayon volcano Monday, the fifth straight day of calm from the
mountain crater, the Business World said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But scientists refused to rule out the danger of further
eruptions from the 2,460-meter (8,000-foot) volcano, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
"In one to two weeks we might be able to say if the eruptions
are finished," Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine
Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Ignoring the danger of fresh eruptions and the threat of
mudflows from Mayon slopes, an estimated 8,000 villagers in the
nearby city of Guinobatan have left evacuation camps and gone back
to their villages, the press report noted.
</P>
<P>
But the report added that only those whose houses lay outside
the six-kilometer permanent danger zone from the crater were being
allowed to go back.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80,000 people fled foothill villages after the volcano
began its latest series of eruptions on February 24. There have
been no reported casualties.
</P>
<P>
Mayon killed some 70 villagers in its last major eruption in
1993. It killed 1,200 people and buried a town under flaming ash
in its deadliest blast in 1814.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Bid For Rowing, Canoeing at SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We will try to ask for a council member approval to feature
rowing and canoeing in the Games," secretary-general of KONI
Rudolf S. Warouw was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rowing and canoeing have been Indonesia's gold mine in the SEA
Games and many other international competitions.
</P>
<P>
Warouw and other KONI's officials will attend the meeting in
Kuala Lumpur from March 9 to 12.
</P>
<P>
In a letter faxed to Warouw on February 29, the Malaysian
Olympic Council secretary-general Sieh Kok Chi officially
suggested 23 sports to be featured in the biennial event.
</P>
<P>
The sports are badminton, basketball, boxing, cycling, golf,
gymnastics, hockey, karate, lawn bowling, pencak silat, sepak
takraw, shooting, soccer, squash, swimming which includes diving,
synchronized swimming and water polo, table tennis, taekwondo,
tennis, ten-pin bowling, track and field, weightlifting, wushu and

events, fencing, judo, petanque (petanque), volleyball, netball,
wrestling and waterskiing. He also said the maximum number of
sports to be staged at the Games would be 30.
</P>
<P>
"Rowing, canoeing, softball and body building will have less of
a chance to be included as too many sports in the program will be
a waste of time and money," Sieh said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
KONI vice chairman Harsuki said Indonesia would ask the
federation to stage more sports which are featured in the Olympic
Games and Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
"We are targeting the Olympic Games as the top of our athletes'
performance. We will ask the federation to eliminate the sports
which are not included in both competitions," he said.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Intensifies Infrastructure Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Nanjing, capital city of east
China's Jiangsu Province, is expected to become the fifth city
with subways after Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou,
according to deputies of the Ninth National People's Congress from
the province, who are here attending the ongoing 3rd annual

776 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Governor Ji Yunshi said his province will continue to carry out
the proactive fiscal policy this year and increase investment in
infrastructure to spur economic growth. Fixed-asset investment in
the province totaled 274.2 billion yuan (33 billion US dollars) in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu expects an annual economic growth of ten percent this

<HEADLINE> More Needy ethnic Minority People from Yunnan, Guangxi to Be Relocated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan Province and Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region in southwest and south China plan to relocate
750,000 local needy ethnic minority residents in an effort to help
them out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this end, Yunnan will invest approximately three
billion yuan (362.5 million US dollars) in the next seven years to
relocate a total of 500,000 ethnic minority locals in need,
according to Provincial Governor Li Jiating, who is here attending
an annual session of the nation's legislature as a deputy to the
Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Mainly inhabited by ethnic minorities, Yunnan had some 2.45
million people in abject poverty by 1999. And a total of 71
outlying poverty-stricken counties in the province were included
in the national program for poverty reduction, accounting for 12
percent of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is resolved to cope with the poverty problem through the
means of relocation and education. For those scattering in
secluded mountainous areas with natural environment unfit for
living, the only way out is to relocate them and settle them down
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yang Caishou, an NPC deputy from the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region and a provincial official in charge of poverty
alleviation in the region, said Guangxi plans to gradually
resettle 250,000 needy farmers in the Dashi Mountains as from next
year.
</P>
<P>
Starting from 1993, Guangxi have relocate more than 200,000
locals in want and need, who are currently adequately fed and
clothed.
</P>
<P>
The central government initiated its ambitious poverty-
reduction program in 1994, pledging to help its 80 million needy
population out of poverty in seven years, which, by the year 1999,
had been reduced to 34 million, or 4.3 percent of the total rural
residents.

<HEADLINE> China's Economic Focus Being Shifted Westward: Economists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government-initiated revitalize-the-west decision is a
strategic shift that concerns the country's modernization building,
whose obstacles lie in the west rather than in the east, said Wang
Mengkui, economist and director of the Development Research Center
under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
China turns to the west for fresh driving forces to propel its
two-decade-long, fast-paced economic growth now plagued by a
sluggish domestic market demand. An economically backward west
will not only drag the heels of the east but the country as a
whole, according to renowned economist Dong Fureng, honorary
director of the Economic Research Institute under the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
China's reform and opening-up drive started in the eastern
coastal areas, and twenty years of development have greatly
improved local economic and social conditions, and enabled a
robust national economic growth. However, it has also resulted in
a widening disparity between the east and west.
</P>
<P>
The east-west gap is an key factor that triggers off the
lukewarm domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
With the west taking off, China's east is expecting an enormous
domestic market for its products in the hinterland, observers here
said.

<HEADLINE> Initial Success for Myanmar to Cultivate Buckwheat as Opium Substitute Crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar authorities said it is now
ready to export to Japan the first container of buckwheat, a kind
of opium poppy substitute crop, harvested in the opium growing
northern Shan state of the country.
</P>
<P>
The 18 tons of buckwheat to be exported was out of the 40 tons
harvested in Kokang region in the state although most of the
buckwheat cultivations were damaged due to bad weather condition
in the last December, Deputy Minister of Progress of Border Areas
and National Races and Development Affairs Brigadier-General Than
Tun told the press here Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The export of buckwheat from Myanmar is believed to show the
world community that the country is committed to eradicate opium
poppy cultivation by cultivating buckwheat as a substitute crop.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Japan agreed in 1992 to substitute opium poppy with
buckwheat in Myanmar's northern Shan state and it was realized
only in 1997 with 1.62 hectares of the crop trial cultivation
conducted in the state's Tarshwetang area. It was found out to be
the one of superior quality after laboratory analysis was carried
out in Japan.
</P>
<P>
In August 1998, Japan provided four tons of buckwheat seeds to
Myanmar farmers who cultivated 81 hectares in the Kokang region.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's cultivation area of
poppy substitute crops such as sugarcane and buckwheat stood at 4,
916 hectares in 1999 while it was 5,898 hectares in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fire Haze at Danger Level in Sumatra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Haze from forest fires raging in
Indonesia's Sumatra island has passed hazardous levels, said
Muhammad Alamsyah, head of the Sumatra Environmental Impact
Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said schools were opening late, children were being kept
indoors and supplies of essential smoke masks were running out.
</P>
<P>
"The pollution level has passed 300 in Pekanbaru (capital of
Riau province) and around the Caltex oil well. Protection masks
should be a 'must-wear' during this condition," Alamsyah was
quoted by the Indonesian Observer Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
A reading higher than 300 on Indonesia's Air Pollutant Standard
index is regarded as "hazardous." Normally, healthy air rates
below 50.
</P>
<P>
Alamsyah said that as of Monday, 212 hotspots had been located
in Riau. The haze is the strongest in the morning and normally
begins to clear after 09:00 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Khodijah Nurhadi, another official at the agency, said the body
had recommended a state of emergency be declared around Pekanbaru.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the haze was blowing toward Singapore and
Malaysia, and officials said the smoke level appears to be on the
rise.
</P>
<P>
"Satellite pictures have indicated some increase in the fires
in central Sumatra. We've seen some smoke blowing toward
peninsular Malaysia and Singapore," Singapore Meteorological
Service spokesman Wong Teo Suan was quoted by the Indonesian
Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Singapore monitors Indonesia forest fires by satellite as part
of a regional cooperation program.
</P>
<P>
Smoke pollution from illegal land-clearing fires in Indonesia
has become an annual problem during the region's mid-year dry
season.
</P>
<P>
The situation was disastrous in 1997, when thick haze caused
health problems and hurt tourism in Singapore and parts of
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 fires destroyed about 5 million hectares of forest in
the country with an economic loss of about 4 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Tension Grows Between Guatemala, Belize  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Relations between Guatemala
and Belize have deteriorated over territorial disputes, reports
reaching here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan Foreign Minister Gabriel Orellana said Belize was "
playing with fire," referring to its military maneuvers at the
border.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala, which demands Belize give back 12,000 square
kilometers of land, wants the land controversy to be settled by an
international tribunal of justice, to which Belize is opposed.
</P>
<P>
Belize canceled a meeting between the two sides scheduled for
February 25 and 26 in Miami, the United States, following
Guatemala's detention of three soldiers and a policeman from
Belize at the borders.
</P>
<P>
Orellana insisted that Belize prepared this border incident to
frustrate the meeting in Miami.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan Embassy in Belize was attacked with a bomb a
week ago, damaging some buildings in the embassy.
</P>
<P>
A former British colony, Belize declared independence in 1991,
which was recognized by the Guatemalan government of President
Jorge Serrano Elias in 1993 but "ignored by subsequent Guatemalan
heads of state."
</P>
<P>
The territorial dispute between Guatemala and Belize has its
origin in a border accord signed in 1859 between Guatemala and
Britain.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Fight Violation of Intellectual Property Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian government has vowed to
take resolute measures to protect intellectual property rights and
fight piracy.
</P>
<P>
Although Ukraine has signed a series of international
conventions on the protection of intellectual property rights, it
still lacks effective management and supervision in this field,
said Deputy Prime Minister Ykola Zhulynsky here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Piracy of audio-video products and computer software is rampant
in his country, Zhulynsky said at the first meeting of the
Intellectual Property Rights Protection Committee, which was
established in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has joined international pacts such as "The Bern
Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works," "
The Universal Copyright Convention" and "The Convention for the
Protection of Producers of Phonograms against Unauthorized
Duplication of their Phonograms," according to the deputy prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign companies and individuals have taken legal actions
against the violation of their intellectual property rights by
Ukrainian enterprises. The illegal practice has triggered off
discontent from Ukraine's trading partners and damaged the
country's image, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed strengthening legislation to protect
intellectual property rights and combat piracy.
</P>
<P>
The committee is composed of three working teams responsible
respectively for giving legal advice, crackdown on piracy and
market supervision.

<HEADLINE> Chile Preparing to Try Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President-elect Ricardo
Lagos said Monday that one of his duties is to create conditions
to put life-long senator Augusto Pinochet on trial.
</P>
<P>
In his statement carried on Monday's Brazilian weekly "Veja,"
Lagos stressed Chile's sovereign right to put him on trial, saying
judge Juan Guzman is now preparing 60 charges against Pinochet for
violations of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The judge asked a court Monday to strip General Pinochet of
immunity so he could be tried for the killings of 53 people and
the disappearance of 19 others shortly after his 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
Any prosecution against Pinochet would first require stripping
his immunity as a senator-for-life, Lagos said.
</P>
<P>
Guzman has already indicted several other military officers,
including two generals, in the same case.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet is now resting at his heavily-guarded Santiago
residence. He returned home Friday after a 16-month detention by
Britain, escaping the attempt of a Spanish judge to bring him to
trial.
</P>
<P>
Britain released him after ruling he was mentally and
physically unfit to stand trial.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Simplifies Entry-Exit Procedures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- It has become much easier for
foreigners and local citizens in northeast China's Liaoning
Province to enter and leave China with the introduction of the new
entry-exist regulations.
</P>
<P>
Cheol Gon Yu, a director of the LG Group of the Republic of
Korea, was among the first four foreigners in the province to get
a permanent residence certificate from the local public security
bureau since the new regulations were enacted as of February 29.
</P>
<P>
According to the new rules, foreigners who make contributions
to China's technological and cultural development will be granted
a PRC "green card".
</P>
<P>
And no visa procedures nor charges are needed within the next
five years when they go abroad. Their spouses and children are
also welcomed to settle down in China.
</P>
<P>
Also, foreign engineers, traders and investors who take part in
trade negotiations with China's large and medium-size state-owned
enterprises can get the visa upon arrival at Dalian, Dandong, or
Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
For Taiwanese investors engaged in business for more than five
years in Liaoning province will be granted free entry and exit
visas for five years.
</P>
<P>
Economic development with foreign countries has seen a steady
rise of exit-entry visas in the last few years. The new
regulations will be a great convenience for people both at home
and abroad, said Zhuang Min, vice-deputy of the local public
security bureau.
</P>
<P>
Engineers and managers in local state-owned enterprises can
apply for passports if only they provide application forms, ID,
and evidence that they are working in China when they go to Hong
Kong or Macao for business.
</P>
<P>
ID cards, enterprises' confirmation and a fixed deposit of 50,
000 yuan (about 6,000 U.S. dollars) are the only documents
required when Chinese citizens want to travel abroad.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 370,000 foreigners visited Liaoning
Province last year. Eight thousand of these foreigners came on
business. In contrast, 130,000 Chinese citizens went abroad for
personal reasons.

<HEADLINE> Australia and China To Tackle Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China and Australia are joining
efforts to tackle the problem of desertification in Alxa League,
in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Australia has donated 12.5 million Australian dollars (about
791,000 U.S. dollars) and the China's central and local
governments have invested the equivalent amount in RMB.
</P>
<P>
Alxa, located in the western part of the autonomous region has
an area of 270,000 square kilometers. The region is the most
serious desertized region in the country.
</P>
<P>
Desert in the region is moving southeastward at about 20 meters
a year threatening railways, salt lakes and arable land. And some
70 million cubic meters of mud and sand are washed into the Yellow
River every year.
</P>
<P>
Sand storms during Spring affects northwest and north China
including Beijing. Alxa and neighboring regions suffer economic
losses of over one billion yuan (120 million U.S. dollars) each
year. And even some 20,000 herdsmen would become "ecological
refugees" as local people term it.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Australian program is scheduled to restore the oasis,
recycle resources, and plant grass and trees to prevent sand
storms.
</P>
<P>
When the project is completed in 2015, three green belts are
expected to be built and help reduce agricultural and industrial
losses by 190 million yuan (about 22.8 million U.S. dollars)
annually.
</P>
<P>
The Alxa League has spent 330 million yuan (about 40 million U.
S. dollars) over the past decade to spread tree seedlings and
grass seeds by air along the desert.

<HEADLINE> Singletons More Intelligent: Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Singletons in China are more
intelligent than those with siblings, according to a ten-year
research project carried out by the Anhui University of Medical
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Six researchers at the university analyzed 43 environmental
factors which affect children most, and concluded that the family
is the leading factor influencing a child's intelligence.
</P>
<P>
They said singletons have advantages over other children
because parents of the former spend 2.7 hours a day teaching their
children, while those of the latter only spend one hour.
</P>
<P>
One-child families tend to be better off economically, thus
giving the child better opportunities to learn music, dancing and
swimming, and to go on trips. All this is said to be favorable to
the development of intelligence.
</P>
<P>
However, researchers also warn that parents not spoil their
only child, as this will adversely affect talent and development.
</P>
<P>
China introduced the policy of one-child families in the late
1970s.

<HEADLINE> Ill Giant Panda Being Treated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Veterinarians in southwest China's
Sichuan Province are doing their best to prolong the life of a 16-
year-old giant panda who was diagnosed with skin cancer last year.
</P>
<P>
This was the world's first known case of skin cancer in a giant
panda.
</P>
<P>
The panda, named "Le Le," was found to have developed skin
cancer while at the Shanghai Safari Park.
</P>
<P>
Since Le Le returned to the Wolong Nature Preserve last June,
Chinese veterinarians have gathered from all over the country with
30-40 secret recipes handed down for generations, and have
concocted special medicines for Le Le. However, so far it has
produced very little effect.
</P>
<P>
The preserve also invited three experienced veterinarians from
Liaoning and Jiangsu provinces and experts from the Unites States
to treat Le Le's disease.
</P>
<P>
Some American experts advised a mercy killing for the panda,
but the preserve insisted on trying to save its life and is now
doing rehab therapy.
</P>
<P>
The panda breeder Chen Renwu is spraying the panda with
antiseptic disinfectant twice a day, and Le Le is anaesthetized
each week while medicine is administered.
</P>
<P>
Chen also picks up fresh arrow bamboo, the panda's favorite
food, from a nearby mountain and provides Le Le with milk, apples,
and eggs and sugar everyday.
</P>
<P>
However, Le Le has a bad temper because of his severe pain, and
walks to and fro in his den, roaring now and then, at which time
not even the breeder dare to approach.
</P>
<P>
Chen predicts that Le Le will live for at least two or three
more years.

<HEADLINE> Rural Women in China Involved in High-tech Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Over one million rural women in
the city of Maoming, one of China's largest fruit and vegetable
bases in Guangdong Province, have increasingly involved themselves
in high-tech agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1970s, a great number of men in the rural areas
have moved to cities or township enterprises as a result of
agriculture restructuring, said a local agricultural official. Now
the city's rural women are shouldering a bigger role in farming,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The rural women are also striving to upgrade their education
while participating in production, the official said, and the city
has set up 602 special schools providing diversified training
programs on agricultural technology for women. So far, more than
800,000 rural women have received such training, and 6,000 have
become qualified agriculture technicians.
</P>
<P>
After mastering at least one practical skill, the rural women
have shown great ability and have made great achievements in a
variety of agricultural fields, such as crops farming, fruit
planting, and poultry breeding.
</P>
<P>
To date, the women have 2.4 million mu (160,000 ha) of crops
bases, 2.6 million mu (173,000 ha) of orchards, and one million mu
(124,000 ha) of vegetables. At the same time, they are feeding
more than three million pigs and 150 million chickens.

<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China's insurance market is in
need of qualified supervisory staff as the country is preparing
for the WTO entry, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Wu Xiaoping, vice chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory
Commission (CIRC), was quoted by today's China Daily as saying
that the domestic market will become closely linked to the
international market, and the supervisory systems will be affected
by international norms if China enters the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"Such a change will require more qualified staff and
supervisory personnel."
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks at a seminar on international insurance
here, which is organized by Lloyd's of London and the Chartered
Insurance Institute (CII).
</P>
<P>
The CII has been offering professional qualification
certificates and related examinations in China in the past decade
and bears close relations with Chinese insurance institutions.
</P>

The seminar is designed to introduce British supervisory
expertise to China.

GENEVA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- FIFA's executive committee will
discuss its position on the banned steroid nandrolone when it
meets March 23-24, world soccer's governing body said in Zurich,
Switzerland on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, FIFA said that it "has not decided to strike
nandrolone off the list of prohibited substances."
</P>
<P>
On Friday, FIFA said a study it commissioned found that, under
physical stress, men's bodies can produce nandrolone "in a
quantity that is such that the threshold value of two nanograms
per milliliter of urine could be produced by the athlete himself."
</P>
<P>
It is not yet scientifically clear how much nandrolone the body
could produce, spokesman Andreas Herren said.
</P>
<P>
The world's leading IOC-accredited drug control laboratories
last month restated the validity of their nandrolone tests.

<HEADLINE> WBA Poised to Strip Lewis of Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Undisputed heavyweight champion
Lennox Lewis of Britain could lose his WBA title when the
sanctioning body rules on his next title defense.
</P>
<P>
Lewis is scheduled to defend his WBC and IBF belts against
Michael Grant on April 29 in New York. The WBA has told Lewis he
must fight its No. 1 contender, Johnny Ruiz, in his next mandatory
defense before taking other fights.
</P>
<P>
At a 4-1/2 hour hearing in a hotel ballroom in Philadelphia on
Monday, WBA officials heard testimony from a half-dozen witnesses,
including promoter Don King, regarding Lewis's failure to make his
next mandatory defense against Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
"Fight or vacate the crown," King, who represents several WBA
contenders, said in describing what he claims to be Lewis's only
choice under association rules. "That's what the deal is today, as
we speak."
</P>
<P>
WBA Championships Committee Chairman Elias Cordova of Panama
later said that seven committee members would reach a decision on
whether to strip Lewis of its crown "within a few days."

<HEADLINE> Senior WHO Official to Help Reconstruct Health Services in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) has named a senior WHO
official to head the new health administration there.
</P>
<P>
As head of the Office of Health, Dr Jim Tulloch, Director of
the Child and Adolescent Health Program at World Health
Organization (WHO)headquarters, will oversee the reconstruction
and organization of health services in East Timor in the lead-up
to independence,according to a WHO press release here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I am both honored by the confidence placed in me by the WHO
Director-General, and looking forward to the challenge which
rebuilding a health system will entail," said Dr Tulloch.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only around 20 East Timorese doctors remain in the
country to serve a population of approximately 800,000 people, WHO
said. Only one of the doctors is a specialist. Two top priorities
will be to train more people to work in primary health care and to
obtain the services of specialized doctors until local doctors are
sufficiently trained.
</P>
<P>
The newly-appointed health authority, in consultation with UN
agencies, has outlined the following as their near-term priorities:
</P>
<P>
- Re-building and rehabilitation of healthcare facilities;
</P>
<P>
- Re-establishing of basic health services throughout the
country;
</P>
<P>
- Ensuring the supply of essential drugs and immunization
services;
</P>
<P>
- Training and support for East Timorese health personnel; and
</P>
<P>
- Maintaining the communicable disease surveillance system
instituted by WHO since September 1999 and improving disease
prevention and control.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the short-term priorities, there is a need to
start to develop health policy, to decide on health financing
mechanisms and to establish legislation and regulations related to
health.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Blames U.N. Mission, Int'l Peace-Keepers for Worse Security in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Tuesday blamed
the U.N. Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the
international peace-keeping force (KFOR) for failure to protect
Serbs and other non-Albanian civilians in the Serbian province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia said that terrorists of the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA) have been continuing violence against Kosovo non-
Albanians after the international civilian and military presence
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The blame came as Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of
the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations, was speaking at a
press conference here. Kosovo "is now in full state of chaos,
lawlessness, terrorism and intimidation of all kinds against Serbs
and non-Albanian population," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Bernard Kouchner, head of the UNMIK, argued here
Monday that the mission was mandated to work in an extremely
difficult situation, such as the lack of necessary funds and
international police for the region.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic, who attended the Monday closed-door session at the
Security Council, complained at the press conference that Kouchner
did not mention Yugoslavia's sovereignty or that more than 350,000
Serbs, Romas and other minorities "were the victims of the policy
of ethnic cleansing and genocide under the U.N. flag."
</P>
<P>
Many minorities in Kosovo have been the victims of terrorist
attacks by ethnic Albanians, who make up a majority of the
province's population.
</P>
<P>
Also at the press conference, Jovanovic provided the text of
his speech, originally prepared for addressing the Monday Council
meeting. But "one permanent member," as he put it, blocked him
from delivering the speech at the Council meeting although he
previously got the permission to go ahead with the speech.
</P>
<P>
Though he stopped short of identifying the country, he simply
said, "You can guess which one."
</P>
<P>
The speech painted a "sad and sorry picture of Kosovo" since
the presence of the UNMIK and the KFOR nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
Within the past nine months since the presence of the UNMIK
and the KFOR in Kosovo in June last year, "we have been witness to
systematic violations of all key provisions of Security Council
resolution 1244," he said in the prepared speech.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted resolution 1244 on June 10
last year, demanding full respect for the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, security and equality for all
ethnic groups in Kosovo, and the full disarmament and disbanding
of the KLA.
</P>
<P>
The "KFOR has done nothing to prevent Albanians" from staging
ethnic cleansing against non-Albanians, he said.
</P>
<P>
In his prepared speech, he said that after the nine-month
presence of the UNMIK and the KFOR, 4,354 terrorist acts in which
910 people were killed, 802 wounded and 821 abducted, while 350
kidnapped Serbs are kept incarcerated in Albania.
</P>
<P>
More than 350,000 Serbs, Montenegrins, Muslims, Roma, Turks,
Goranci and other non-Albanians have been expelled, he said,
adding that several hundred Serbs have been detained in "labor
camps," controlled by the KLA in the villages of Maticane,
Dragaseveo and Drenica. He said that these camps "are not even
accessible to the Red Cross."
</P>
<P>
During the same period, more than 50,000 houses have been
destroyed, burned or seriously damaged, he said, adding that 84
Orthodox Christian churches, monasteries and cultural-historical
shrines have been destroyed, burned or seriously damaged, and
private and public property continue to be seized.
</P>
<P>
"The Serbs and other non-Albanians, not yet expelled from
Kosovo and Metohija, have been ghettoized in small enclaves,
without a possibility to move out of them on pain of being killed,
kidnapped, terrorized," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Includes Pakistan in South Asia Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will include Pakistan in his trip to South Asia later this month,
the White House said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The White House announced Clinton's visit to India and
Bangladesh last month, but did not mention Pakistan because of the
military takeover last October. Until now the White House has
dismissed any reports about Clinton's possible stop over Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
On Monday a National Security Council spokesman, when asked
about Pakistani newspaper reports that Clinton will stop at an air
base near Islamabad after leaving Bombay on March 25, denied such
a plan, saying: "No decision had been made."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, however, made the announcement on
Tuesday. And observers here say the United States still wants to
keep its balance strategy in South Asia while criticizing Pakistan
's military rule.
</P>
<P>
A White House statement said Clinton would discuss with
Pakistan's Chief Executive Gen Pervez Musharaf a return to
civilian government.
</P>
<P>
"The president will address issues of common concern including
the speedy return to democratic rule, the need to fight terrorism,
the need to ease tensions in the subcontinent, and he feels by
going he can most effectively deliver this message," a White House
official said.
</P>
<P>
And the White House statement said Clinton's decision to
include Pakistan in his South Asia trip "reflects the importance
of making efforts to continue dialogue with an important nation of
the region."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's travel to South Asia starts on March 20. The White
House did not immediately say when his visit to Pakistan would
take place or where Clinton would talk with Pakistan's leader
Musharaf.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Panel Set Up to Weigh Peace Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations set up
a new panel here Tuesday to weigh peace operations in an apparent
bid to boost the international community's role in maintaining
peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced at a press conference
the start of the eight-men panel, which is named Study on United
Nations Peace Operations.
</P>
<P>
The new institution, chaired by Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi, is
assigned to reviewing the problems facing the U.N. peace
operations and offering recommendations to better the missions.
</P>
<P>
"We must not promise too much, or raise expectations higher
than are justified by the will of governments to act. But we must
do whatever we can to raise the standards of international
behavior and responsibility," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
A number of U.N. peace-keeping operations like that in Rwanda
failed for various reasons and the U.N. chief said the
international community must do its utmost not to allow horrors,
especially "appalling failures" by the United Nations, ever to
happen again.
</P>
<P>
"I think we can only hope to succeed in that, if we have a
very clear idea of what has been wrong up to now. We need a clear
set of recommendations on how to do better in future in the whole
range of U.N. activities in the area of peace and security," Annan
said.
</P>
<P>
The group is mandated to deal with specific problems such as
what kind of forces are needed in peace operations, what are the
conditions in which different kinds of mission are appropriate,
what to do when circumstances change and large numbers of
civilians are in danger of being massacred, according to the
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
They are also entrusted with the task of studying how to have
the right structure for the U.N. Secretariat and proper planning
and organization with clear lines of command, control,
accountability and cooperation between those carrying different
mandates.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, the secretary-general's former special envoy in
Afghanistan, said that his panel would start its work immediately
and its first meeting would be held on March 23.
</P>
<P>
Other panel members include Brian Atwood, former head of the
United States Agency for International Development, Dame Ann
Hercus of New Zealand, Annan's former special representative in
Cyprus, Richard Monk of Britain who was involved in the
International Police Force in Bosnia and General Klaus Naumann,
former chief of the German defense staff and former chairman of
the military committee of NATO.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also announced that he was sending a U.N. team
to Cambodia next week to discuss the issue of a tribunal to try
the Khmers Rouges who have been accused of genocide and other
violations of international humanitarian law in that country.
</P>
<P>
He also said that his envoy Homann-herimberg was in Moscow
this week in an attempt to reach a formal agreement with the
Russian authorities on humanitarian action inside Chechnya and
negotiate the details for implementing it. U.N. High Commissioner
for Human Rights Mary Robinson is going to visit the area next
month.

<P>
OTTAWA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Canada exported a record 3.7
billion Canadian dollars (about 2.5 billion U.S. dollars) worth of
fish and seafood products in 1999, the government announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This is the second year in a row we have achieved a record
high," said Minister of Fisheries and Oceans Herb Dhaliwal in a

</P>
<P>
The minister hailed the country's success in "building a strong
foundation" on conservation so as to be able "to take full
advantage of international market opportunities."
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of Canada's fishery products were exported
to the United States, Japan and the European Union in 1999,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Exports to the United States increased by 21 percent from 2.14
billion Canadian dollars (about 1.47 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998
to last year's 2.58 billion (about 1.78 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The United States remained the No.1 buyer of Canada's fish and
seafood products, while exports to the European Union increased by
nine percent in 1999, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Dhaliwal is at the International Boston Seafood Show to promote
Canada's seafood industry, which is the world's sixth-largest with
business in more than 100 countries.

<P>
According to National Superintendancy of Customs
Administration of Peru, trade between Peru and EU reached last
year 2.56 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Europe is the destination of 25.4 percent of Peruvian exports,
and represents 15.4 percent of imports of this South American
country.
</P>
<P>
EU's main markets for Peruvian exports last year were Britain (
560 million dollars), Germany (246 million), Spain (179 million),
Belgium (149 million) and Portugal (20 million ).
</P>
<P>
Britain's main position is due to the growth of exports of
Peruvian gold. In the case of Belgium and The Netherlands, it's
thanks to the favorable condition of entry ports and distributing
of merchandise.
</P>
<P>
Main export sectors of Peru to European Union in 1999 were
minig (843.582 million dollars), agroindustry (311.788 million
dollars), fishing (214. 614 million dollars), textiles and thread
(82.924 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> U.S. Colorado Governor Signs Gun-Control Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"What we've done is we've balanced the public's need to try to
keep firearms out of the hands of criminals with the private right
to purchase a firearm," Owens said.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which took effect immediately, restores the authority
of the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to conduct criminal
background checks on people attempting to buy guns from federally
licensed firearms dealers.
</P>
<P>
The law was among a group of bills proposing stricter gun
regulation that Owens endorsed in the wake of the Columbine High
massacre, the worst school shooting attack in U.S. history, and
other gun-related violence. Fifteen people were killed at the
suburban school, including the two teen-age gunmen.
</P>
<P>
The measure signed Tuesday might not have prevented the
Columbine tragedy, Owens said, but it would have prevented the
killings of three girls last August by their father who then died
in a shootout with police.
</P>
<P>
However, some gun-rights groups have criticized the law as too
restrictive on law-abiding citizens, but Owens said it was a good
compromise.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Says Kosovo Serbs Suffer Genocide Under U.N. Flag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Tuesday said
that the U.N. operation in Kosovo, the Yugoslav province, is the
only one where the U.N. flag "has been used and abused" by local
Albanian terrorists and separatists to commit ethnic cleansing and
genocide against Serbs and other non-Albanians in the province.
</P>
<P>
Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission
to the United Nations, told a press conference here that after the
presence of the U.N. Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (
UNMIK) and the international peace-keeping force (KFOR) in June
last year, violence and attacks against Serbs and other non-
Albanian residents have been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
"This is the only case in the history of peace-keeping
operations of the United Nations that the U.N. flag has been used
and abused for committing the heinous policy and practices of
ethnic cleansing and genocide against other national groups than
Albanians," he said.
</P>
<P>
The briefing at the closed-door session of the U.N. Security
Council by Bernard Kouchner, head of UNMIK, and General Klaus
Reinhardt, commander of the NATO-led KFOR, failed to focus on
important issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
There had been no mention during the briefing of "ethnic
cleansing, no mention of genocide, no invitation by Dr. Kouchner
to visit the camps of the 350,000 exiled Serbs, Romas and others,"
who "are now displaced persons throughout Serbia and Montenegro,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Within the nine months since the deployment of UNMIK and KFOR,
"more than 4,400 terrorist acts have been perpetrated by the
Albanian terrorists and other Albanian groups," he said.
</P>
<P>
Instead of discussing these issues, Kouchner and Reinhardt
said of the lack of necessary funds and international personnel to
police the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has been accusing both UNMIK and KFOR of the
failure to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia and to honor the Security Council resolution 1244,
adopted on June 10 last year.

<HEADLINE> Canada Sees Strongest Industrial Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Canada registered 86.8 percent of
full capacity of its industries in the fourth quarter of last year,
the strongest since the country last saw its boom in 1987 and 1988,
Statistics Canada reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was also the fifth consecutive quarter for a record of
strong industrial capacity, a combined result of business
investment, export and consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
Among the best were the sectors of logging and forestry,
construction and some manufacturers, which all had a utilization
rate of over 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
Electrical and electronics manufacturers reached 92.1 percent
of their full capacity, up 4.4 percentage points from the third
quarter, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Transportation equipment industries were at 93 percent of their
full, though 1.4 points lower than the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The primary metals group was put at a utilization rate of 94
percent and rubber products industries at 96.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Women Harshly Affected by Globalization: SACP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG , March 7 (Xinhua) -- Globalization has increased
job losses and poverty among women, thus entrenching gender
inequality, the South African Communist Party (SACP) said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization has exploited gender inequalities and deepened
and reinforced them in several ways," SACP spokesman Mazibuko Jara
said in the party's message to mark International Women's day
which falls on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Globally, over the last two and half decades governments have
slashed budgets for health care, education and pensions.
</P>
<P>
"These measures have thrown millions of women back into the
invisible realm of private, unpaid reproductive labor," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Poverty Hearings held by the South African
Non-Governmental Organizations and Civic Organizations in 1998
showed that women were employed in the most exploitative jobs
because of their low education and skills levels, and that it was
difficult for them to access land.
</P>
<P>
Their subservient status also made them more susceptible to
contracting HIV-Aids than men because they have little say in
their reproductive health.
</P>
<P>
Women, especially unemployed women in rural areas, townships
and informal settlements experienced the worst effects of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Economic dependence in turn traps women in abusive domestic
relationships.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa also faces an increasing scourge of violence
against women with limited access to justice and support," said
Jara, adding that the SACP's program this year included a campaign
to curb violence against women.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that all of us act against violence against
women. The SACP calls on South African men to take steps to stop
violence against women," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Finalize Mines Sale Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
completed all issues in the Privatization of mines of Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) and an agreement to sell three of
the mines will be reached with Anglo American Corporation (AAC) by
mid this month, said a government minister here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Katele Kalumba said that the government is
finalizing discussions with AAC and a team has already been sent
to London to study the deal.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba said the government has already written to AAC
representative Jack Holmes telling him that it has met the
conditions and it is now only waiting for a response from the AAC.
</P>
<P>
A technical team will arrive next week from London, which will
insure that the mines are sold off properly, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
AAC has deferred scheduled signing of the final take-over
agreement of Zambia's copper mines citing administrative and legal
hitches as the reason.
</P>
<P>
Two sides signed heads of agreement last December under which
the assets of three big ZCCM mines -- Nchanga Division, Konkola
Division and Nampundwe Mine -- will be sold to AAC.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has been making efforts in recent years
to privatize the copper mines to attract foreign investment and
advanced technology and management to revive the ailing mining
industry.

<HEADLINE> Rawlings Optimistic about Oil Discovery in Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 7, (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry John
Rawlings on Tuesday painted a bright picture of prospects of a
major oil discovery in Ghana and appealed to exploration companies
to redouble their efforts, Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"I urge companies which are already working here to continue
their efforts diligently because the signs of good potentials are
there," said the President at the opening of the Fifth Oil and Gas
Conference at the Accra International Conference Centre.
</P>
<P>
The conference, organized by the Ghana National Petroleum
Corporation, has brought together major players in the oil and gas
industry to talk about exploration, production, trade and finance.
</P>
<P>
President Rawlings said almost all of Ghana's offshore area is
 currently licensed to companies that have committed themselves to
 significant levels of investment.
</P>
<P>
Also pleasing is the interest now being shown in the country's
deep waters following the successes in finding giant oil fields in
deep waters off the coast of Nigeria, Angola as well as Equatorial
Guinea and across the Atlantic in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
"I would also like to invite more investors to join in these
exploration activities," he said.

<HEADLINE> Intel Offers Free PCs to Employees Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corporation announced
Tuesday a new benefit program to offer free Pentium III desktop
PCs and unlimited access to each of its more than 70,000 workers
worldwide by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The program "will help employees and their families participate
fully in the information revolution and take advantage of the
educational and e-commerce opportunities on the Internet," the
world's largest chip maker said.
</P>
<P>
Intel's new benefit program follows similar initiatives
launched earlier this year by Delta Airlines and Ford Motor Co.
But Intel provides more extensive system packages and Internet and
service support than previous corporate offerings.
</P>
<P>
As part of the new program, Intel said, employees will receive
systems based on high-end microprocessor and hardware
configurations. Its home PC program will allow employees to have
secure access to information about corporate benefits programs,
training and communications via PCs and the Internet for employees
and family members.
</P>
<P>
"An Internet-savvy workforce supports our mission to be the
preeminent building block supplier to the worldwide Internet
economy," said Craig Barrett, Intel's president and CEO, in a
statement announcing the program. "We see these employer-based
program as a positive trend illustrating the importance of
technology literacy to us all."
</P>
<P>
Intel said that the program will be offered on an ongoing basis
and employees will get periodic "refreshes" to ensure their
hardware and software stay current. Workers will also have the
option to upgrade their systems, peripherals devices and
connectivity by contributing to the price of the system.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua's government stressed
Tuesday it has full sovereignty over San Juan river, natural
border about 180 kilometers between Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
"Nicaragua has every right to impose control and regulation
measures over San Juan river, whether these are of migratory
nature, sanitary, customs, jurisdictional, security or for
protection of resources and ecology," said Vice Foreign Minister
Jose Adan Guerra at a press conference.
</P>

The diplomat made the statement after the current border
conflict with its Southern neighbor, Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
The conflict began 18 months ago, when Managua's authorities
decided to forbid the navigation of armed Costa Rican guards in
waters of San Juan river.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, San Jose requested mediation of the Organization
of American States (OAE).
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica's Foreign Minister Roberto Rojas sent on March 3 a

asking for the naming of a special envoy to mediate in this
situation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warns OPEC on High Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
warned the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
that their members could face sliding demand and eventually less
revenue if oil prices remain at the current high level.
</P>
<P>
U.S. crude futures closed sharply higher in fever-pitch trading
on Tuesday, leaping 1.95 U.S. dollars per barrel, or 5 percent, to
close at 34.13 dollar a barrel. The price was the highest since
November 1990, three months after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC is scheduled to meet on March 27 to decide whether to
increase production to offset a shortage that now stands at more
than two million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I want oil prices to go down some, but the producing
countries should want them to go down some, too," Clinton told
reporters at a White House news conference. "What we want are
stable oil prices that aren't too high."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said oil producing countries must understand that high
prices will hurt them in the longer-term.
</P>
<P>
Two outcomes are likely, he said. "You will either have a big
drop in demand from (high) oil prices ... and it will cut the
revenues of the oil- producing countries below where they would
have been if they'd maintained stable prices at a lower level,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"Or, you will have a lot of non-OPEC members, who aren't
subject to their agreement, start increasing their production,
taking market share away from them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson was to meet on
Tuesday with the oil minister of Qatar, a tiny Gulf producer that
is an OPEC member and a traditional U.S. ally.Richardson also made
a secret trip to Miami on Monday for a quickly-arranged meeting
with the Venezuelan energy minister.
</P>
<P>
Richardson expressed confidence that prices would stabilize
soon after OPEC meets.
</P>
<P>
"What we expect between now and the end of March, when OPEC
meets, is there will be more volatility," said Richardson, who
recently returned from a ten-day diplomatic mission to oil
producers.
</P>
<P>
"After OPEC has increased production, and we're working very
hard that that production be increased sizably and in a timely
fashion, I think you will see a stability in gasoline prices," he
told the NBC's Today Show.
</P>
<P>
But oil traders and analysts are less certain about a sizable
increase in OPEC output, pointing to a deep rift between so-called
price hawks and other members who favor pumping more oil to calm
the market.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the U.S. government said retail gasoline prices
could soar to 1.80 dollars a gallon this summer if OPEC agreed to
increase production by only a modest amount. That would be more
than 65 cents a gallon higher than last summer.
</P>
<P>
World crude oil prices could rise to above 35 dollars a barrel
within a few weeks if OPEC delays any output hike until the fourth
quarter, according to the new U.S. government forecast.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
fell below 10,000 for the second time over two weeks Tuesday as
investors were worried about profits in industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
The Dow closed down 374.47 at 9,796.03. The blue chip index
lost 400 points in late trading before edging higher just before
the closing.
</P>
<P>
On February 25, the industrials closed down 230.51 at 9,862.12,
slipping below the psychological 10,000 mark for the first time
since the index finished above the five digital milestone on March
29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 35.66 at 1,355.62 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell 57.01 at 4,847.84.
</P>
<P>
The market plunged after Procter &AMP; Gamble, a consumer goods
company, warned that the company's earnings in the second half of
its fiscal year will fall sharply, missing its own estimates and
analysts' expectations, because of higher costs of pulp and raw
materials. The warning sparked fears among investors that other
industrial companies might have same troubles with their earnings.
</P>
<P>
While the Dow spiraling lower, the Nasdaq index also slipped on
profit-taking. Analysts said the composite's gains this year have
left it vulnerable to investors eager to collect some profits.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index crossed 5,000 during the trading today before
retreating. With a big loss, the index is still up about 19
percent this year, compared with a loss of about 16 percent for
the Dow index in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 15.45 at 588.57 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 5.42 at 1,016.94. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 6.16 at 595.47.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin oh
the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,104 down, 982 up and 422
unchanged.

NYSE volume increased to 1.30 billion shares from 1.03 billion
in the previous session, according to preliminary calculations.

<P>
JERUSALE, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat started fresh talks late
Tuesday in an apparent effort to revive the stalled peace talks
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said the meeting took place near the
central Israeli town of Lod and was also attended by Palestinian
Parliament Speaker Ahmed Qureia and Israeli Foreign Ministry David
Levy.
</P>
<P>
Israel radio said Barak would put forward certain
"confidence-building measures" in an attempt to convince the
Palestinians to return to the negotiating table.

The proposals will include a further release of Palestinian
prisoners, the opening of a second "safe passage" route linking the

millions of dollars Israel owe the Palestinians in taxes and
duties.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks were deadlocked early

<HEADLINE> U.S. Parties Hold Super Tuesday Primaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Republican and Democratic
parties in the United States held primaries and caucuses in 16
states and territories on Super Tuesday, a day that may settle the
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
On the Republican side, Texas Governor George W. Bush waged a
coast-to-coast campaign to crush his rival Senator John McCain's
political insurgency Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bush, the son of former President George Bush, was favored in
polls to win at least seven of the 13 Republican contests while
Arizonan Senator McCain was strong in five New England states
accounting for 102 of the 613 delegates.
</P>
<P>
Bush, whose staff is already raising money and drawing up
battle plans for November, said he was prepared for a tough
campaign against Vice President Al Gore and his Clinton
administration allies.
</P>
<P>
At stake in the Super Tuesday balloting were 613 delegates,
more than half the total needed for Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
In the Democratic race, Gore battled former New Jersey Senator
Bill Bradley in Super Tuesday primaries from Maine to California.
</P>
<P>
In all, the two rivals were on ballots in 15 states and
American Samoa, competing in primaries and caucuses with 1,315
delegates at stake in a virtual nationwide primary.
</P>
<P>
California was the biggest of the contests, offering 367
delegates and a political foothold in a state critical to the
party's effort to hold the White House in November.
</P>
<P>
The vice president sought a sweep of all the party contests
Tuesday, as rival Bill Bradley seemed ready to leave the race
unless he did surprisingly well.
</P>
<P>
Bradley described Tuesday as "take-off day" for his lagging
campaign. Polls showed Gore heading for victory in all 16
Democratic primaries and caucuses.
</P>
<P>
Gore flew home to await the results in his home state of
Tennessee, where his political career began more than two decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
In an early but significant show of support and solidarity,
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton cast her first vote for Gore as
resident of New York.
</P>
<P>
Gore built his delegate advantage by beating Bradley in the
leadoff Iowa caucuses in January, then scored victory again in the
nation's first primary in New Hampshire in February.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Clarity on Kosovo Political Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Tuesday called for clarity of the future political status of
Kosovo, a Serbian province, saying he and the Security Council
would take up the contentious issue shortly.
</P>
<P>
Annan told a press conference, "We are operating in a very
ambiguous operation, in a limbo, because the future, the political
outline has not been defined."
</P>
<P>
Annan's remarks echoed a statement at the Security Council
Monday by Bernard Kouchner, head of the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), who told the 15-nation
Council at a closed briefing that time had come to open a debate
on the political future of the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
However, Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the
Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations, told a press conference
Tuesday that Yugoslav, as the host and a sovereign country, has
the right to demand full respect for its sovereignty and
territorial integrity, stipulated by Security Council resolution
1244, adopted on June 10 last year.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. operation in Kosovo is the only one where the U.N.
flag "has been used and abused to commit ethnic cleansing and
genocide," said the senior Yugoslav diplomat. "This is the only
case in the history of peace-keeping operations of the United
Nations that the U.N. flag has been used and abused for committing
the heinous policy and practice of ethnic cleansing and genocide
against other national groups than Albanians."
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic, who attended the Monday Council briefing, said that
there had been no mention at the briefing of "ethnic cleansing, no
mention of genocide, no invitation by Dr. Kouchner to visit the
camps of the 350,000 exiled Serbs, Romas and others."

<HEADLINE> Peru, EU to Promote Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Peru is looking for the strengthening
of its trade with the European Union (EU), said the authorities of
this South American country.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Superintendancy of Customs
Administration of Peru, trade between Peru and the EU reached 2.56
billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Europe is the destination of 25.4 percent of Peruvian exports,
and represents 15.4 percent of imports of this South American
country.
</P>
<P>
The EU's main markets for Peruvian exports last year were
Britain (560 million dollars), Germany (246 million dollars),
Spain (179 million dollars), Belgium (149 million dollars) and
Portugal (20 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Britain's main position is due to the growth of exports of
Peruvian gold. In the case of Belgium and the Netherlands, it's
thanks to the favorable condition of entry ports and distributing
of merchandise.
</P>
<P>
Main export sectors of Peru to the European Union in 1999 were
mining (843.582 million dollars), agro-industry (311.788 million
dollars), fishing (214. 614 million dollars), plus textiles and
thread (82.924 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Among Peruvian exports to the EU predominate raw material and
products with scant added value.
</P>
<P>
Experts are recommending the strengthening of Peru's exports,
the promotion of alliances between Peruvian producers and European
entrepreneurs, and greater technology and industrialization.

<HEADLINE> Car Sales In Britain Fall On Price Uncertainty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- New car sales in Britain fell in
February to 73,735 - 12.3 percent lower than in the same month in
1999, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
(SMMT).
</P>
<P>
The motor trade is pinning its hopes on March's "W"plate
lifting total new car registrations above the previous March's 370,
060.
</P>
<P>
This also suggests that consumers may be waiting to see if
prices fall following the publication of the government's
Competition Commission report into the new car market which is
expected in a few weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
The commission has been holding an investigation into car
prices after a host of top-name manufacturers were accused of "
price-fixing" - preventing dealers offering discounts beyond a set
level.
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline, the motor industry remained upbeat, as the
figures were better than forecast. "We forecast 70,000
registrations for February but actually secured 73,735," said SMMT
chief executive Christopher Macgowan.
</P>
<P>
The industry was confident that March 2000 sales of the new W-
registration cars would exceed the March 1999 total of 370,060,
Macgowan said.

<HEADLINE> BAT Profits Nearly Double On Rothmans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Profits at British American Tobacco
(BAT), the world's second largest cigarette company, jumped 86
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The company markets brands such as Lucky Strike, State Express
555 and now Rothmans, reported pre-tax 1999 profits of 1.371
billion pounds after 738 million pounds a year earlier on turnover
up 25 percent at 21.7 billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
BAT announced that the growth in profits was boosted by a seven-
month contribution from Rothmans, which was overtaken by the
company last year.
</P>
<P>
The takeover of Rothmans created a global tobacco group, second
in size only to Philip Morris, which makes Marlboro.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the Rothmans merger, we made a major advance in
1999," BAT chairman Martin Broughton said. But he expressed "
disappointment" that its success has yet to be reflected in its
share price.
</P>
<P>
Its shares have underperformed the benchmark UK share index,
the FTSE, by 20.3 percent in the past 12 months.On Monday, they
closed at 274p after a setting a high of 675p in January 1999.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asks Congress to Quickly Pass Gun Control Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clinton made the call in the wake of the fatal shooting of a 6-
year-old girl by a classmate in Michigan State on February 29. A
day later, a gunman killed two people and critically wounded three
others in Pennsylvania State.
</P>
<P>
He chided lawmakers for failing to meet to work out the
differences between the House and Senate versions of a juvenile
justice bill since last summer, saying that "American people have
waited long enough" for new protections.
</P>
<P>
"I know the gun lobby is cranking up pressure on Congress again,
" Clinton said. "But when first-graders shoot first graders, it's
time for Congress to do what's right for America's families."
</P>
<P>
He challenged Congress to produce final legislation for his
signature by April 20, the first anniversary of the massacre at
Columbine High School in Colorado State. Fifteen people were
killed at the suburban school, including the two teen-age gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, lamenting last week that 13 children are killed by
guns every day in America, sought the meeting with congressional
leaders to "break the logjam" on legislation to require gun safety
locks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton wants to require safety locks on guns, ban the import
of large-capacity ammunition clips and require background checks
before buying a weapon at gun shows. The House and Senate have
passed separate versions of the bill but have not come together on
a compromise.
</P>
<P>
The statistics, culled from the Juvenile Offenders and Victims
1999 national report, found that since 1980, one in four murders
of juveniles involved a juvenile offender. Nearly 38,000 juveniles
were murdered between 1980 and 1997.

<HEADLINE> Experts Meet to Assess Environmental Impact of Cyanide Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A team of international experts met
here Tuesday to start preparing a scientifically-based,
independent report on the environmental impact of the cyanide
spill which occurred at the site of the gold and silver producing
company in Romania on January 31.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva meeting follows the mission by the United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP) and the U.N. Office for Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in response to a request for an
emergency evaluation by the governments of Romania, Hungary and
Yugoslavia, according to the United Nations Office at Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The team, consisting of 16 experts from seven countries,
finished its sampling on March 5 on the Danube in Yugoslavia. The
experts carried out a rapid two-week assessment from the spill
site in Northwest Romania. Some 800 kilometers downstream through
the Lapus ,Somes and Tisza rivers, they collected water, sediment
and soil samples in specific sites all the way to the Danube delta.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the mission carried out from February 26 to
March 6 will be the basis for a joint UNEP/OCHA report, which is
expected to come out by late March or early April.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Parties Hold Super Tuesday Primaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Republican and Democratic
Parties in the United States held primaries and caucuses in 16
states and territories on Super Tuesday, a day that may settle the
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
On the Republican side, Texas Governor George W. Bush waged a
coast-to-coast campaign to crush his rival Senator John McCain's
political insurgency Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bush, the son of former President George Bush, was favored in
polls to win at least seven of the 13 Republican contests while
Arizonan Senator McCain was strong in five New England states
accounting for 102 of the 613 delegates.
</P>
<P>
Bush, whose staff is already raising money and drawing up
battle plans for November, said he was prepared for a tough
campaign against Vice President Al Gore and his Clinton
administration allies.
</P>
<P>
At stake in the Super Tuesday balloting were 613 delegates,
more than half the total needed for Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
In the Democratic race, Gore battled former New Jersey Senator
Bill Bradley in Super Tuesday primaries from Maine to California.
</P>
<P>
In all, the two rivals were on ballots in 15 states and
American Samoa, competing in primaries and caucuses with 1,315
delegates at stake in a virtual nationwide primary.
</P>
<P>
California was the biggest of the contests, offering 367
delegates and a political foothold in a state critical to the
party's effort to hold the White House in November.
</P>
<P>
The vice president sought a sweep of all the party contests
Tuesday, as rival Bill Bradley seemed ready to leave the race
unless he did surprisingly well.
</P>
<P>
Bradley described Tuesday as "take-off day" for his lagging
campaign. Polls showed Gore heading for victory in all 16
Democratic primaries and caucuses.
</P>
<P>
Gore flew home to await the results in his home state of
Tennessee, where his political career began more than two decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
In an early but significant show of support and solidarity,
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton cast her first vote for Gore as
resident of New York.
</P>
<P>
Gore built his delegate advantage by beating Bradley in the
leadoff Iowa caucuses in January, then scored victory again in the
nation's first primary in New Hampshire in February.

CARACAS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
said Tuesday he will meet with his Colombian counterpart, Andres
Pastrana, on May 4 in Bogota instead of April 4 as previously
announced.
</P>
<P>
Chavez declared that it was a mistake made by Venezuelan
Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel in announcing the meeting
date of the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
The leader said that there had no agenda for the meeting as
the date was set just Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, the Colombian Foreign Ministry also announced
that the two presidents will have a meeting in Bogota on April 4
to evaluate the bilateral integration process.
</P>
<P>
At that meeting they will evaluate the relations between both
countries, the reactivation of border trade and the development of
the peace process in Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide PC Demand Expected to Grow in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Unit volume in the worldwide
PC market in the first quarter of 2000 is expected to grow 20
percent year over year, according to forecast data released
Tuesday by U.S. market research firm International Data
Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
But with the traditionally slower first quarter in full swing,
IDC said, PC shipments are expected to decline 9 percent from the
fourth quarter 1999.
</P>
<P>
"With Y2K fears largely over and the introduction of Microsoft
Windows 2000," IDC said, "businesses will start picking up the
pace of upgrades." The research firm expects the commercial market
to show more robust growth this year than last, starting with a
pickup in demand this quarter.
</P>
<P>
Asia-Pacific and Japan will lead the way in PC sales for the
quarter with 32 percent growth each over the first quarter last
year, according to IDC's forecast. Both Asia-Pacific and Japan
will continue to benefit from strong consumer demand as price
points decline and interest in new desktop designs increase;
consumer growth will top 68 percent and 45 percent in the region
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, IDC expects first quarter growth to reach
20 percent. Western Europe's growth is pegged at 10.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, the key to vendor growth this quarter is
related to the strategic alignment with growing consumer and small
business segments. In addition, positioning in the U.S. and Asia-
Pacific markets will be especially important. Finally, IDC found
solid Internet strategies and the ability to deliver portable PCs
in volume will also be keys to growth.
</P>
<P>
There were a total of 113 million PC shipments worldwide in
1999, according to IDC data. Compaq and Dell were on top of all
vendors, respectively capturing 13.9 percent and 10.5 percent
worldwide market share.

PARIS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- France said Tuesday that it backs
the candidacy for the seat of general director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) by Horst Koehler, the current
president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development

Agence France-Presse quoted sources of the French government as

</P>
<P>
Koehler, who was a close associate of former German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, has contacted Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder over the
candidacy after the United States rejected another German
candidate, Caio Koch-Weser, as soon as he was nominated as the
European candidate for IMF leadership Monday.
</P>

French President Jacques Chirac had a telephone conversation
with Schroeder last Saturday over the European candidate for IMF
leadership to replace Frenchman Michel Camdessus.
