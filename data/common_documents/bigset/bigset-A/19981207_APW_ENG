East Timorese separatists mourn victims of Indonesian invasion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ About 2,000 pro-independence activists
rallied peacefully Monday in disputed East Timor on the 23rd
anniversary of the territory's invasion by Indonesian troops.
	   A United Nations envoy, meanwhile, met prominent figures in
Dili, the seaside capital of East Timor, in an effort to promote
U.N.-sponsored peace talks on the former Portuguese colony.
	   In another protest, about 100 East Timorese students blocked
traffic and chanted demands for a referendum on independence
outside the U.N. headquarters in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
	   The group chanted pro-independence slogans and waved rebel
flags. Police later stopped them from marching to the U.S. Embassy.
	   ``We want to show the world that most East Timorese people want
to be separate from Indonesia,'' protester Mariano Lopez said.
	   In Dili, demonstrators prayed for those killed in the 1975
invasion of East Timor, which unleashed a long-running guerrilla
war. After several months of relative calm, sporadic fighting has
resumed in recent weeks.
	   A few activists hoisted rebel flags after a Mass at Santa Cruz
cemetery, where Indonesian troops fired on separatists in 1991,
drawing international condemnation.
	   A national fact-finding commission found at least 50 people were
killed and dozens were missing. Independent sources and human
rights activists put the death toll at about 200.
	   Many students at East Timor University, a center of
anti-Indonesian activism, did not demonstrate Monday because they
had exams.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 but the United Nations has
never recognized the Southeast Asian nation as the administering
power. U.N. officials are currently sponsoring peace talks between
Indonesia and Portugal, East Timor's former colonial master.
	   U.N. envoy Tamrat Samuel flew to Dili this past weekend for
talks with key players in East Timor. He has met students, human
rights activists, government and military officials and Roman
Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, co-winner of the 1996 Nobel peace
prize.
	   Samuel was scheduled to return to Jakarta on Tuesday. The U.N.
chief's personal representative for East Timor, Jamsheed Marker, is
expected to visit Dili later this month.
	   After years of human rights abuses, Indonesia softened its
stance on East Timor after former President Suharto's authoritarian
rule ended in May.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has offered a measure of
autonomy in exchange for recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over
the territory's 800,000 people.

Singapore facing more cases of rare rat urine disease
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A rare disease spread by rat urine that caused
an epidemic in Thailand is on the rise in Singapore, health
officials said Monday.
	   Leptospirosis _ a bacterial infection that can lead to jaundice,
meningitis, as well as kidney and liver complications _ infected 14
people during the first eight months of 1998, according to the
Ministry of Health.
	   Last year, a total of 9 people were infected, while only 7
contracted the disease in 1996, the ministry added. Four people
have died from leptospirosis during the last five years.
	   Although the numbers are relatively small, the trend has caught
the attention of environment and health workers in Singapore.
	   A recent epidemic in the northern Thai province of Phrae killed
at least nine people and put about 100 in the hospital, convincing
authorities there to offer a bounty on rats.
	   The bacteria is present in the organs of rodents, frogs, rabbits
and snakes, and victims often contract the disease after contact
with contaminated water.
	   Patients normally develop high fever, severe headache, muscle
pains and sometimes enlarged livers, symptoms often mistaken for
the flu. If detected early, the illness is easily treated.
	   Singapore's environment ministry has stepped up its checks for
rats, reported The Straits Times. Although the city-state is known
for its generally tidy streets and clean conditions, rats can be
frequently seen at night in outdoor food centers and older
neighborhoods.
	   Last year, the ministry conducted 138 inspections for the
disease-carrying rodents, but had already checked 211 locations
during the first nine months of this year, the newspaper reported.

Perry discusses North Korea's nuclear issue with Seoul officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ William Perry, the newly appointed
U.S. government point man on North Korea, met Monday with South
Korea's foreign minister to discuss a growing dispute over a
suspected North Korean nuclear weapons site.
	   Foreign Ministry officials confirmed that the luncheon meeting
between Perry and Hong Soon-young focused on the suspected North
Korean facility, but they refused to disclose details.
	   Perry, a former U.S. defense secretary, arrived Sunday for a
three-day visit that will include talks with President Kim Dae-jung
and other top government officials. He was scheduled to fly to
Tokyo on Tuesday, then to Beijing the next day.
	   Ministry officials said Perry explained to Hong about a firm
U.S. demand for access to a suspected underground nuclear facility
under construction at Keumjang-ri, 40 kilometers (25 miles)
northeast of the North's main nuclear complex at Youngbyon.
	   Washington officials warn that North Korea's refusal of the U.S.
demand could lead to a collapse of a 1994 nuclear accord, under
which the North's communist government promised to abandon its
suspected nuclear weapons program.
	   U.S. spy satellite photographs taken early this year showed
thousands of North Korean workers burrowing in a mountainside at
the site, raising suspicion that the facility may be
nuclear-related.
	   While claiming that the facility is for civilian use, North
Korea has offered to allow a one-time inspection of the site, but
only if the United States pays it dlrs 300 million for having made
``false'' accusations. Washington has refused to do that.
	   In Monday's meeting with Perry, Hong supported the U.S. demand
for unlimited access to the suspected site, but he also stressed
the importance of Seoul's policy of engagement with Pyongyang's
communist government, officials said.
	   South Korean officials worry that renewed tension on the
peninsula could hurt their economy which is showing signs of
recovery after a year of deep recession, thanks in part to a dlrs
58 billion bailout by the International Monetary Fund. So Seoul has
been trying hard to be included in talks with Pyongyang.
	   Perry's visit comes as U.S. and North Korean officials are
negotiating terms of an outside inspection of the suspected weapons
site. A two-day meeting in New York last week appeared to make
little progress toward that goal. But the negotiations were to
resume in Washington on Monday.
	   Before freezing its suspected nuclear weapons program under the
1994 accord, North Korea was believed to have extracted enough
plutonium to make one or two atomic bombs.

Report: Indonesia's Bakrie and Brothers sell stock to pay debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's PT Bakrie and Brothers has
sold more than half its stake in satellite-based mobile phone
system Iridium LLC to U.S. insurance giant American International
Group to pay off some foreign debt, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted Bakrie and Brothers, which has interests
in plantations, telecommunications, finance and steel
manufacturing, as saying that the sale is part of an attempt to
overhaul the company's finances.
	   Indonesian conglomerate Bakrie and Brothers has been negotiating
with its creditors to restructure dlrs 1.2 billion in debts.
	   Without disclosing the value of the transaction, the company
said the sale proceeds covered its foreign debt due this year,
according to the report.
	   The company said earlier that dlrs 250 million debt is due this
year.
	   Iridium, based in Washington D.C., has developed a global
wireless communication network that enables subscribers to
communicate using handheld telephones and pagers virtually anywhere
in the world.
	   Bakrie invested in Iridium in May 1997, when it bought 7.5
million shares for around dlrs 100 million.
	   Bakrie and Iridium, together with Japan's IDD Corp. have formed
a joint venture to provide Iridium's services to the South Pacific
region.
	   Indonesia was hit hard by Asia's financial meltdown and is
enduring its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Many businesses are now trying to negotiate deals with foreign
creditors to overcome massive debt problems.

China set to put democracy campaigner on trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Speeding up a campaign to stamp out a would-be
political opposition party, Chinese authorities will put one of its
leading organizers on trial next week, a rights group reported
Monday.
	   Court officials in east China's Hangzhou city notified Wang
Youcai's wife on Monday that his trial on charges of ``inciting the
overthrow of state power'' will be held Dec. 17, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China reported.
	   Detained a month ago, Wang was only formally arrested on Nov.
30, part of a concerted effort to silence the leadership of the
China Democracy Party.
	   That same day, two other prominent dissidents and party
organizers, Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin, were taken into custody. Like
Wang, they have been accused of crimes under China's vague state
security law.
	   China's Communist Party leaders have repeatedly used the law,
revised last year, to punish high-profile dissidents.
	   Authorities appear to be moving with haste against the three
dissidents. To arrest and try Wang in what would be 18 days is
unusual, especially in such a politically sensitive case.
	   The Information Center called the speed proof that Chinese
leaders have already decided to convict Wang.
	   Wang's wife, Hu Jiangxia, hurriedly hired a lawyer, and they
were to meet with Wang on Monday, the Information Center said. It
added that Hu also appealed to court authorities to conduct a
public trial.
	   Administrators at the Hangzhou No. 1 Intermediate People's Court
did not immediately answer telephone inquiries about the trial and
the charges.
	   Cases of subversion are usually tried behind closed doors. A
court in Shanghai, 150 kilometers (90 miles) north of Hangzhou,
barred all but Lin Hai's lawyers from attending the computer
entrepreneur's subversion trial on Friday. He was accused of
sending 30,000 Chinese e-mail addresses to an Internet democracy
magazine.
	   Wang Youcai rose to prominence as a student leader of the
democracy demonstrations based in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in
1989. Put on the 21 most-wanted list by the government in its
crackdown, Wang served two years in prison.
	   He boldly announced the formation of the China Democracy Party
on June 25, the day President Bill Clinton arrived in China for the
first visit by a U.S. president in nine years.
	   Police waited until Clinton's departure before moving against
Wang. Of the 12 party organizers detained in the first wave of
arrests, Wang spent the longest in custody, over seven weeks. He
was taken away again two months later, on Nov. 2. Police never
notified his wife where he was being held and why.
	   Fellow party organizers, Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin, started their
open dissent in the seminal Democracy Wall movement of the late
1970s.
	   Xu spent 12 years in prison, much of it in solitary confinement,
and when his parole ended late last year he took up a role as an
adviser and coordinator for many democracy campaigners.
	   Xu said last month he only became directly involved in efforts
to set up the China Democracy Party when another prominent
dissident dropped out.
	   A member of Xu's circle, He Depu, said Monday he was beaten over
the weekend for campaigning for a seat in one of Beijing's district
legislatures.
	   It was the second time he claimed he was beaten campaigning at
the Beijing Information Engineering College, part of his
constituency. Local election officials have told He his campaign is
illegal, but he said they have refused requests to inform him in
writing.

Australia gets own edition of People's daily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Chinese People's Daily, which
boasts a readership 20 times the size of Australia's population, is
about to gain another couple of thousand readers -- by publishing
in Australia daily.
	   The move was hailed Monday as a bridge between the two nations,
and welcomed by Foreign Minister Alexander Downer for giving
Australians a ``direct window'' on developments in the world's most
populous nation.
	   But few will be able to walk across the bridge or see through
the window -- the Communist Party broadsheet will not be printed in
English.
	   Its initial run will be limited to 2,000 copies, allowing
Chinese Australians to read the People's Daily on the same day it
is published in China.
	   Its cover price is 80 Australian cents (U.S. 50 cents), and it
expects to operate at a loss for at least a year.
	   Sydney businessman Li Min Ma, publisher and agent for the
Australian edition, said it would rely on advertising for profits.
	   The paper's overseas editions are read by 200,000 people in 80
countries, mostly in the United States.
	   But its 400 million readers in China make it one of the 10
largest circulation dailies in the world.
	   Monday's edition carried a full-page report on Australia with a
photo of the Sydney Harbor Bridge to illustrate its theme of
bridging the Australia-China relationship.
	   It carried other photos of kangaroos, koalas, and the beach at
Surfers Paradise.
	   Monday's page one stories included the Asian Games, an
anti-corruption campaign and an article on cloning.
	   Downer said all areas of Australia's relationship with China had
made ``real strides'' and he looked forward to the possibility of a
visit from President Jiang Zemin soon.
	   He noted that China was Australia's fifth largest trading
partner, with bilateral trade totaling almost 10 billion Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 6.2 billion).

Report: China's hard-hit textile industry misses goal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's textile industry lost 3.6 billion yuan
(dlrs 430 million) in the first 10 months of this year, despite
laying off half a million workers, the official China Daily
reported Monday.
	   State-owned textile factories are suffering from a decline in
exports as a result of the Asian financial crisis and a sluggish
and glutted domestic market.
	   Textiles have been one of the hardest sectors to revive in
nationwide reforms of debt-ridden, overstaffed state industries.
	   Bankruptcies helped hold losses to 3.6 billion yuan (dlrs 430
million) between January through October, 1.3 billion yuan (dlrs
160 million) less than in the first 10 months of 1997, the China
Daily reported, citing the State Bureau of Textile Industry.
	   About 100,000 more textile workers are scheduled to lose their
jobs by the end of the year. Most textile workers are women who do
not have other job skills.
	   Textile exports dropped 5.26 percent in the first nine months of
the year compared with the same period last year. The newspaper
quoted Du Yuzhou, director of the State Textile Bureau, as saying
state companies were trying to export more to European and American
markets and improve efficiency.

Seven dead, 36 hurt in retirement home; three dead in Paris
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Fire broke out in a retirement home outside Paris
before dawn Monday, killing seven people and injuring 36 others, 10
seriously, authorities said.
	   The blaze began at about 4 a.m. (0300 GMT) in Livry-Gargan in
the northern working-class suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis,
firefighters said.
	   In a northern Paris neighborhood, another fire left three people
dead and 13 hurt, three seriously, firefighters said.
	   That blaze broke out at about 3 a.m. (0200 GMT), and 150
firefighters with 43 trucks took an hour to knock it down, the
officials said on customary anonymity.
	   The fire, in the 9th district near Montmartre, began in a
staircase and spread to the fourth, fifth and sixth floors,
officials said.
	   The cause of both blazes was under investigation.

World's tallest telecommunications tower gets go-ahead in Melbourne

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The world's tallest tower -- if you
count the communications antenna on top -- is to be built in
Melbourne, nudging out Toronto's CN Tower by just over 19 1/2 feet
(six meters).
	   The CN Tower in Toronto, Canada has laid claim to the world's
tallest structure since it was built in 1976 and stands at 1,815
feet (553.3 meters), including its communications antenna.
	   But under international rules measuring buildings, antennas do
not count toward the height of the building.
	   Purists who spurn antennae on their skyscrapers consider the
1,483-foot (452-meter) Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, completed
in 1996, the world's tallest building.
	   Chicago's Sears Tower, at 1,450 feet (442 meters), held the
title from 1973 until 1996.
	   Victorian state Premier Jeff Kennett announced Monday that the
Grollo tower concept had won the bid for the Docklands site on
Melbourne's western fringe.
	   He said the Grollo Group had four months to prove its financial
capacity and to satisfy conditions set by the Docklands Authority.

Shares in Hong Kong surge on rate cuts, Wall Street rebound
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Shares in Hong Kong surged early Monday, lifted
by unexpected rate cuts in both Hong Kong and China and a sharp
rebound on Wall Street Friday.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index soared more than 300 points when
the market opened Monday. It continued to edge up, ending the
morning session 415.82 points, or 4.2 percent, higher at 10,378.96.
The index lost 0.8 percent on Friday.
	   After the market closed Friday, leading Hong Kong banks
announced they were cutting their prime lending rate, reserved for
the most creditworthy customers, to 9.25 percent from 9.50 percent.
	   The interest rate cut is good news for the property and bank
sectors because more potential homebuyers could afford mortgages to
buy new flats.
	   Shares in big developers surged early Monday. Cheung Kong
Holdings was up 2.50 Hong Kong dollars to 55.75, while Sun Hung Kai
Properties Ltd. gained 3.50 to 58.75.
	   Banking shares also soared, with market heavyweight HSBC
Holdings rising 8.50 to 194.50. Shares in some smaller local banks,
which write most of the mortgages, gained as much as 9.1 percent.
	   Mainland China also reduced interest rates by 0.5 percent on
average effective Monday, lifting China-related shares on the Hong
Kong stock exchange.
	   Felix Ngai, vice president at Sun Hung Kai Commodities Ltd.,
said the market is likely to remain strong for one or two days
because ``there's room for an interest rate cut in the U.S.''
	   On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 135.46 points
to 9,016.14.

Dalai Lama notes anniversary of Universal Declaration of Human
</HEADLINE>
Rights &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The Dalai Lama said Monday he was
encouraged that worldwide celebrations were planned for the 50th
anniversary of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.
	   ``People everywhere have come to realize the great importance
and value of human rights,'' the Tibetan Buddhist leader said in a
statement released from Dharmsala, the northern Indian town where
he has lived in exile since fleeing his homeland following a failed
anti-Beijing uprising in 1959.
	   The Dalai Lama, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize, has led a
campaign seeking greater autonomy for Tibet within China, and
accused China of trying to smother the Tibetans' language and their
distinct way of life and worship. Beijing denies the charges and
says the Dalai Lama is trying to split China.
	   ``Some governments have contended that the standards of human
rights laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are
those advocated by the West and do not apply to Asia and other
parts of the Third World because of differences in culture, social
and economic development,'' the Dalai Lama said Monday, without
directly mentioning China. ``I do not share this view and I am
convinced that the majority of ordinary people do not support it
either.''
	   The U.N. human rights declaration adopted Dec. 10, 1948 declares
``all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights,''
and that their basic rights include that of life, economic
well-being and freedom of expression.

World's tallest telecommunications tower gets go-ahead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS currency conversion; ADDS that antenna on top extends
height of building, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The world's tallest tower _ if you
count the communications antenna on top _ is to be built in
Melbourne, nudging out Toronto's CN Tower by just over 19 1/2 feet
(six meters).
	   The CN Tower in Toronto, Canada has laid claim to being the
world's tallest structure since it was built in 1976 and stands at
1,815 feet (553.3 meters), including its communications antenna.
	   But under international rules measuring buildings, antennas do
not count toward the height of the building.
	   Purists who spurn antennae on their skyscrapers consider the
1,483-foot (452-meter) Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, completed
in 1996, the world's tallest building.
	   Chicago's Sears Tower, at 1,450 feet (442 meters), held the
title from 1973 until 1996.
	   Victorian state Premier Jeff Kennett announced Monday that the
Grollo tower concept had won the bid for the Docklands site on
Melbourne's western fringe.
	   He said the Grollo Group had four months to prove its financial
capacity and to satisfy conditions set by the Docklands Authority.
	   The 1,837-foot (560-meter) obelisk, estimated to cost up to 1.5
billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 930 million), will include
120 floors of apartments, a luxury hotel and offices.
	   Even though its main structure _ solar power collectors and
mechanical rooms _ would stop at the 1,640-foot (500-meter) level,
that would be higher than the Petronas Towers.
	   As tall as it may be, Grollo's obelisk will not be the most
imaginative edifice ever considered for Melbourne.
	   A developer once proposed a huge kangaroo-shaped building, which
would have included a helicopter landing pad in the pouch area.

Young princesses dance on stage for charity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie made their stage
debut in a surprise performance to raise money for a children's
charity.
	   The daughters of Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen
Elizabeth II, and his ex-wife Sarah, Duchess of York, danced with
the Natalie Vincent Ballet School at London's Theatre Royal on
Sunday night to support the charity, Children in Crisis.
	   Princesses Beatrice, 10, and Eugenie, 8, were dressed in
matching pink tops, blue skirts and ballet shoes. Their hair was
tied back with white tinsel. Program officials said the girls had
been practicing for a couple of months to perfect the group dance.
	   ''It was genuinely their idea,'' said presenter Jeremy Beadle.
``It's the first time the two princesses and their friends have
ever performed in public.''
	   The show also included a family concert of Christmas carols.
Officials hoped to raise 100,000 pounds (dlrs 160,000) for the
charity, which the duchess helped found in 1993.

Defense attorney for cult guru arrested on suspicion of hiding

 &UR; Eds: EDITS thruout to CLARIFY charges &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ An attorney for the doomsday cult guru accused in
the 1995 gassing of the Tokyo subway has been arrested on charges
of obstructing the seizure of income, police said Monday.
	   Yoshihiro Yasuda, 51, was arrested Sunday on suspicion of
conspiring to hide rent income of 200 million yen (dlrs 1.7
million), police said.
	   That money would have been seized by a government
debt-collecting agency as collateral for borrowings from housing
loan companies, they said.
	   Chungli Sun and his son Naoki, who borrowed the money, are
suspected of hiding the rent income to prevent it from being
seized, Kyodo News agency reported. They were arrested in October,
police said.
	   Yasuda allegedly instructed the tenants of two Tokyo buildings
to pay the rent into bank accounts of companies affiliated with
Sun's real-estate company in 1993, rather than directly to the
company itself, Kyodo said.
	   That was an illegal attempt to hide the money, said a spokesman
for the Tokyo Police Department, on condition of anonymity.
	   If convicted of the charges, Yasuda faces a maximum penalty of
two years in prison or a fine of 500,000 yen (dlrs 4,000).
	   Yasuda is a defense attorney for Shoko Asahara, 43, who is on
trial on charges of masterminding the nerve gas attack on the Tokyo
subway that killed 12 people and injured thousands.
	   Other lawyers for Asahara said Yasuda's arrest would hurt their
work.
	   ``We cannot condone the acts of the police and prosecutors,''
lawyer Osamu Watanabe was quoted as saying by Kyodo News service.
``Mr. Yasuda is the heart of our work. It's really tough without a
skipper.''
	   Japanese trials generally take a long time to reach a verdict. A
trial as complex and serious as Asahara's is expected to take
years.
	   Masses of soured loans from housing loan companies called
``jusen'' are a major part of the bad debt problem plaguing the
Japanese economy.

Report: Woman follows Thai premier during Asian Games torch run
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai Airways stewardess who
reportedly has a crush on Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, chased him
while he ran through Bangkok carrying the Asian Games' torch, The
Nation newspaper reported Monday.
	   The stewardess, Jittiporn Apibalpuwanart, made headlines last
year when she engaged in an altercation with Chuan's bodyguards
after taking a seat next to the prime minister on a Thai Airways
flight.
	   The bodyguards complained to airline management, saying she had
annoyed the prime minister. Jittiporn insisted she was Chuan's
friend and knew his mother well.
	   Chuan had to issue several denials to the press that he had a
relationship with the woman.
	   The Nation reported that Jittiporn waited for Chuan on Sunday
outside the Supreme Court. The prime minister was one of several
prominent Thais who ran in a relay, carrying the torch to the main
stadium for the opening ceremony of the 13th Asian Games, being
hosted by Bangkok.
	   As the prime minister passed the Supreme Court, his bodyguards
prevented Jittiporn from getting near him, so she ran after him on
the sidewalks, The Nation said.
	   Chuan finished his run at the Royal Hotel by handing the flame
to the Olympic Committee of Asia chairman, and then dashed into his
car to return to his office.

After weeks of illness, Yeltsin returns to work
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two weeks after he was hospitalized with
pneumonia, President Boris Yeltsin returned to work in the Kremlin
Monday morning, a presidential spokesman said.
	   Yeltsin almost disappeared from sight when he entered a
government hospital Nov. 22 with pneumonia, the latest in a long
string of health problems in recent years for the Russian leader.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said during the weekend
that Yeltsin was feeling better and would return, adding that the
president was ``still the most influential politician in the
country, no matter what is said about it.''
	   Many of Yeltsin's opponents claim he hasn't been seriously
involved in national affairs for a long time and is no longer fit
to lead.
	   Despite calls for his resignation, Yeltsin and his doctors
insist that the president will serve out his term, which ends in
2000.
	   Presidential aides said last week that doctors were having a
hard time persuading Yeltsin to rest and recover completely from
his illness. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov appealed to Yeltsin to
stay in hospital and complete his recovery.

Police raid violent area arresting 25 suspected militants
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZAHID HUSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Police and paramilitary Rangers swept
through troubled neighborhoods of southern Karachi and arrested 25
suspected ethnic militants Monday following a weekend of violent
protests.
	   The men were arrested in Liaqatabad neighborhood in the heart of
this violent port city, said police spokesman Fazi Uzman. Uzman
told The Associated Press that police uncovered a hidden room he
called ``a torture cell.''
	   Police believe it was run by militant members of the Muttaheda
Qami Movement (MQM), a group that claims to represent Indian Muslim
immigrants to Pakistan after the Asian subcontinent gained its
independence from Britain in 1947.
	   Several years ago the MQM split into rival factions that
routinely clash. Their bitter feuding has turned entire
neighborhoods in Karachi, a bustling city of 14 million people,
into battlefields.
	   On Sunday one person was killed and eight people wounded,
including four policemen, said police and eyewitnesses. Militants
hurled hand grenades at a police station and fired rocket launchers
at policemen.
	   ``Lots of people just left the area and those who remained
behind hid inside and listened to the constant gunfire,'' said
Raheel Ahmed, 35, a resident of the area.
	   The day-long violence was to protest a decision last month by
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to impose federal rule in the troubled
province. He dismissed the government, ordered the governor to rule
and brought in the army to set up military courts that would try
suspected terrorists.
	   Mutilated bodies of MQM members are routinely found in Karachi,
often hidden in garbage bins and empty fields. Some carry notes
identifying the victims as rivals or police informers.
	   Kunwar Khalid Younis, spokesman for the MQM's largest faction
led by exiled leader Altaf Hussein, denied accusations that his
activists were involved in torture.
	   ``It's just not true ... it's easy to put a knife in a room and
say this is a torture cell,'' he said.
	   Younis, whose faction is the dominant political group in
Karachi, has accused Sharif's government of trying to erode the
MQM's support.
	   The MQM is demanding recognition in Pakistan as a fifth ethnic
group like Punjabis, Pathans, Baluch and Sindhis. The MQM has
accused successive governments of discrimination.

India out cheaply in first tour match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAPIER, New Zealand (AP) _ Northern Districts held the upper
hand Monday on the opening day of a four-day cricket match after
bowling out India for 103 at McLean Park.
	   Northern Districts was 121 for one at stumps with captain Craig
Spearman unbeaten on 65 and Mathew Sinclair not out 28.
	   India made a disastrous start to the match when it crumbled to
20 for five, including the loss of star batsman Sachin Tendulkar
for five.
	   Saurav Ganguly and wicketkeeper Nayan Mongia brought some
respectability to the score with a sixth-wicket partnership of 46,
but once they were dismissed the tourists folded quickly.
	   Ganguly top-scored with 37 in 138 minutes, with Mongia, who made
21, and Venkatesh Prasad, with 14, the only other players to make
double figures.
	   Andrew Penn led Central's bowling effort with 4-43 off 16 overs
while fellow new-ball bowler David Blake claimed three wickets and
Michael Mason two, including that of Tendulkar. (djp)

	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Six Gulf Arab leaders
gathered for their annual summit Monday, facing oil prices at
historic lows and a show of force from giant neighbor Iran in the
form of Gulf naval maneuvers.
	   For the first time, the summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council
is being attended by leaders outside the group. South Africa's
President Nelson Mandela and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
arrived in Abu Dhabi late Sunday.
	   Annan flew in from Libya, where he met with Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi to try to arrange the trial of two suspects in the
1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, that
killed 270 people.
	   ``We are well on the way to resolving the problem,'' Annan told
U.S. Secretary Madeleine Albright by telephone on Sunday, according
to a U.N. statement.
	   Annan has been trying to get Libya to accept a U.S.-British plan
to try the two suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the
Netherlands. Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for
failing to surrender the men for trial.
	   Mandela and Annan were apparently invited to raise the summit's
profile. The Gulf leaders were arriving Monday for the evening
opening of the summit.
	   Summit host, the United Arab Emirates, said Sunday that trying
to stabilize erratic oil prices, which are hovering at 12-year lows
of between dlrs 10 and dlrs 11, will be the main topic of
discussion at the GCC.
	   Emirates' Information Minister, Sheik Abdullah bin Zayed Al
Nahyan, told reporters in Abu Dhabi that that ``oil be an important
topic ... one of the top issues that will be discussed'' at the
summit.
	   The Gulf oil producers have been hit hard by the sharp drop in
prices. The GCC states _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman
and the Emirates _ control about half of global oil reserves. Oil
exports account for some 75 percent of their revenues.
	   Relations with Iran, their giant neighbor across the Gulf, have
been troubled since Tehran annexed three Gulf islands in 1992. The
fly-speck but strategic islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunbs and
Lesser Tunbs are also claimed by the Emirates
	   Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, deputy commander of the
Emirates armed forces, said last week that ``continued illegal
Iranian occupation of these islands'' and Iran's military power
``constitute a source of major tension,''
	   As a show of force ahead of the summit, Iran's navy and its
elite Revolutionary Guards, began five days of naval maneuvers
Friday.
	   Some 50,000 men and dozens of warships were taking part in the
exercises, which extended from the Gulf to the Strait of Hormuz and
into the Gulf of Oman. Among the dozens of such Iranian exercises
held each year, on is nearly always during a GCC summit.
	   Annan was expected to brief Gulf leaders on Security Council
sanctions on Iraq. Some GCC members, such as the Emirates, favor
lifting the sanctions to end the suffering of Iraq's people.
	   But Kuwait, whose invasion by Iraq triggered the sanctions in
1990, and Saudi Arabia, which Iraq attacked in the subsequent Gulf
War, insist that the sanctions remain until Baghdad complies with
U.N. resolutions. These call for Iraq to eliminate its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   According to Emirates officials and Western diplomats, who
insisted on anonymity, the summit was also to discuss American and
British efforts to overthrow Saddam Hussein and the U.S. plan to
set up a ``shield'' of missile batteries in the region.
	   One diplomat said the GCC states were less negative about the
shield plan than when it was presented in October. But he said the
GCC remains wary of any plan to oust Saddam, fearing it could
plunge the region into chaos and set a dangerous precedent.

Female jockey dies after race fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australia's first female Aboriginal
jockey, Leigh-Anne Goodwin, died Monday from injuries sustained in
a race fall at a country meeting at the weekend.
	   Goodwin, 27, suffered severe head injuries when she fell from
her mount Bachelor King in the Class 1 Handicap at Roma, in western
Queensland state, on Saturday.
	   She was airlifted to Royal Brisbane Hospital, where she died
Monday after family members asked doctors to switch off
life-support medical equipment, Australian Broadcasting corp. radio
reported.
	   Queensland chief racing steward Steve Railton said it appeared
Bachelor King had broken a leg during the race. An inquiry is
underway.
	   The death is being mourned by the Australian racing industry.
	   ``It leaves you in a state of shock, that you are not going to
see that person anymore,'' said leading Queensland jockey Mick
Pelling.

Dollar up against yen, Tokyo stocks close higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, midafternoon dollar, bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar gained against the yen Monday as
traders scrambled to cover short, or oversold, positions. Japanese
stock prices closed moderately higher.
	   The dollar bought 118.92 yen at midafternoon, up 0.60 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 118.95
yen on Friday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 83.52 points,
or 0.57 percent, to close the day at 14,723.49. On Friday, the
average closed down 57.11 points, or 0.39 percent.
	   The U.S. currency had dipped early in the morning on a Japanese
media report that U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin had
expressed a desire to resign. But the dollar later recovered as
traders covered short positions.
	   ``Without reports in other media (on Rubin's possible
resignation), traders bought back dollars,'' said Kazuhito
Furukawa, a trader at Nippon Credit Bank.
	   Analysts said, however, that concerns about a new bout of
financial troubles in Brazil were capping the dollar's rise.
	   During Friday trading in New York, the dollar moved around the
mid-119 yen level following the release of strong U.S. economic
data, but the currency slipped back later on some worries about
sluggish South American economies.
	   The Labor Department said Friday the U.S. jobless rate fell to
4.4 percent in November, the lowest since April and May, when the
unemployment rate dipped to a 28-year low of 4.3 percent.
	   On the stock market, internationally known blue chips led early
gainers in Tokyo after investors were cheered by Friday's gain of
136.46 points, or 1.5 percent, in the Dow Jones industrial average.
	   The Dow advanced on the strong employment report, which provided
fresh evidence of resiliency in the U.S. economy.
	   Traders said, however, that activity was light as investors
continued to monitor developments in the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party's efforts to solidify a coalition with the opposition Liberal
Party.
	   A coalition is expected to lead to new economic stimulus
measures, as the Liberal Party favors tax reforms to boost the
economy.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 4.28 points or 0.38 percent, to 1,125.00. The TOPIX
closed down 8.17 points, or 0.72 percent, on Friday.
	   Volume was low Monday, with an estimated 239.68 million shares
changing hands on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
compared to 344.53 million shares Friday. Advances outnumbered
declines 696 to 402, while 179 issues were unchanged.
	   The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond rose to
1.055 percent from Friday's finish of 1.045 percent, driving its
price down to 106.43 yen from 106.58 yen.

Iran's riders to compete on horses borrowed from Indonesian team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Iran's riders are borrowing horses from
the Indonesian team to compete in the Asian Games after their own
horses were sent back by the games' veterinary commission,
organizers said Monday.
	   After learning that Indonesia had three reserve horses available
for borrowing, Iran decided Saturday to send its five riders, who
have arrived at the competition site at an army cavalry base in
Saraburi province, an hour's drive north of Bangkok.
	   Only three riders will compete and only in the show jumping.
	   ``The Iranian riders have shown the high spirit of athletes.
They want to take part even though they have to ride another team's
horses and they told me that they want to have a good time and the
horses to have fun,'' said Siraya Chunekamrai, president of the
Veterinary Commission.
	   Late last month, Iran brought in three horses from the United
States and European countries for the games but they were sent back
because they lacked the required vaccination against diseases
peculiar to East Asia.
	   The Iran Equestrian Federation's senior official said the horses
sent to Bangkok lived in areas where the diseases in question had
been eradicated for some 20 years.
	   ``They are among the best and the most beautiful in the world.
If they were allowed to enter the games, they would be a sure bet
to win the championship,'' Brig. Gen. Moradian, the federation's
deputy head, told Iran's official Islamic Republic news agency.
	   However, Siraya said, ``we could not let Iran's horses in
because it would break the rule and could affect other horses' good
health.''
	   Since this is the first time the Asian Games have allowed riders
to bring their own horses to the competition, Thailand has taken on
the responsibility of providing a veterinary team to guarantee that
all horses will return home in good health.
	   The equestrian competition starts Tuesday with the dressage
portion of the three-day event. Riders from 13 nations, with 109
horses in all, are competing in three events _ the three-day event,
show jumping and dressage.
	   Though the riders are Asians, most of their horses came from
Europe and the United States and need special care to acclimatize
them to the tropical heat, Siraya said.
	   The cavalry base has been made into a virtual sanitary zone,
with all local horses and livestock previously housed there removed
seven months ago.
	   The base has ordered people to avoid stopping nearby while
transporting horses and other livestock during the games, Siraya
added.
	   While all the competition horses look healthy and fit, Siraya
worries about Thailand's tropical humidity and heat as foreign
horses are tending to get exhausted easily and sweat profusely.
	   ``The competition will start tomorrow but I am very concerned
about the weather because its effects might reduce the ability of
good horses. We have prepared our team to be ready for any accident
that might occur during the games,'' the veterinarian said.
	   Two ambulances with 50 volunteer veterinarians and workers with
cranes and harnesses are standing by.
	   ``We do not expect accidents, but preparation is the best
thing,'' said Siraya.

 &UR; Coyotes 3, Canucks 3 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Vancouver, British Columbia, Chris McAllister's goal 8:53
into the third period lifted the Vancouver Canucks to a 3-3 tie
with the Phoenix Coyotes.
	   Canucks goalie Garth Snow had 43 saves, including 20 in the
first period, as the Canucks (10-13-3) extended their unbeaten
streak to three (1-0-2).
	   McAllister's goal was the second of his career goal and first in
almost a year.
	   Jeremy Roenick scored twice and Teppo Numminen had three assists
as the Coyotes (15-3-3) blew a third-period lead for only the
second time this season, with both games ending in ties.
	   The Coyotes outshot the Canucks 24-0 over a 17:09 span that
ended when Vancouver captain Mark Messier fired a shot 6:50 into
the second period.
 &UR; Mighty Ducks 2, Sharks 1
	   In San Jose, California, Marty McInnis' power-play goal with
goal with 10:13 remaining gave the Anaheim Mighty Ducks a 2-1
victory over the San Jose Sharks, ending a five-game winless
streak.
	   Anaheim salvaged a win out of a six-game road trip that began
0-4-1, and also snapped a seven-game winless streak against the
Sharks.
	   Steve Shields, the backup to Mike Vernon, has allowed only two
goals in six of his seven starts but has won only one of those
games.
	   San Jose's Owen Nolan scored his second goal of the season,
first since Oct. 22, with a power-play score on a deflection of
Bill Houlder's shot in the second period.

Eleven injured in a clash between rival Indonesian political groups
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Eleven people were injured when
supporters of rival political parties clashed in an Indonesian
town, a news report said Monday.
	   Fighting broke out on Sunday in Brebes, about 250 kilometers
(150 miles) east of the capital, Jakarta, between followers of the
ruling Golkar Party and the Indonesian Democratic Party, or PDI,
who are loyal to opposition figure Megawati Sukarnoputri, the
newspaper Kompas reported.
	   PDI supporters in three trucks and on hundreds of motorcycles
rode through the town and burned Golkar flags, the report said.
They then assembled outside a sports stadium where about 7,000
Golkar supporters were holding a rally, it said.
	   The two groups clashed at the stadium's gates before the fight
was broken up by police, the newspaper reported.
	   Some 19 vehicles were damaged during the clash, it said.
	   Also on Sunday, Megawati, the eldest daughter of Indonesia's
founding President Sukarno, staged a rally in Jakarta where she
called on her supporters not resort to violence.
	   Her plea comes as the world's fourth most populous nation
prepares for a Parliamentary election on June 7 amid growing
economic and social turmoil.
	   The election date was announced last week as part of a package
of political reforms put forward by Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie.

General strike greets Indian prime minister in Kashmir

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Groups opposed to Indian rule in Kashmir
shut down the state's capital for the second day Monday with a
general strike called to protest a visit by the prime minister.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, meanwhile, was 180
kilometers (110 miles) north of Srinagar visiting Tundar, a border
area that has been heavily damaged by Pakistani shells in the
almost routine exchanges of fire between India and Pakistan.
	   Shops were closed and only a few private cars defied the general
strike call in Srinagar on the last day of Vajpayee's two-day
visit, his first to the state since taking office earlier this
year.
	   Sunday, police said explosives hidden in a public toilet
shattered windows of houses and hotels less than three kilometers
(two miles) from the state governor's guest house where Vajpayee
was staying. The small explosion was a reminder militants can still
disrupt life in Srinagar, though the government has declared the
uprising largely subdued.
	   The militants say Muslim-majority Kashmir should not be part of
India, which is predominantly Hindu and officially secular. Several
groups are fighting Indian forces, with some demanding independence
and others union with officially Islamic Pakistan. More than 15,000
people have been killed in the fighting in the last nine years.
	   India accuses Pakistan of arming and training the militants, but
Pakistan says it lends them only moral support. The two countries
have fought two wars over the Himalayan territory in the past 51
years and still regularly skirmish across the Kashmir border. India
controls two-thirds of Kashmir and Pakistan the rest; both
countries claim all of Kashmir.
	   In an arrival statement Sunday in Srinagar, Vajpayee said India
would never give up its claims on Kashmir.
	   ``Kashmir is not merely a piece of land for us in India,''
Vajpayee said. ``Kashmir is one of the best symbols of India's
ancient civilization and modern nationhood.''

Police disperse and injure 60 protesters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Baton-swinging police injured at least
60 people trying to hold a rally of poor village women that was
banned because of threats from Islamic extremists in eastern
Bangladesh, officials said Monday.
	   The violence occurred Sunday in a soccer stadium in
Brahmmanbaria, 50 miles ( 80 kilometers ) east of Dhaka, local
police said in a telephone interview on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The rally was sponsored by private development groups that
provide loans to help poor village women start small businesses.
The agencies planned to gather thousands of poor women to showcase
their programs.
	   The celebration was opposed by conservative Islamic clerics, who
accuse the voluntary agencies of encouraging Muslim women to take
on roles outside the family.
	   Authorities said they banned the rally after the clerics vowed
to attack the women and planned a simultaneous Islamic conference
at the same venue.
	   On Sunday, police used batons to scatter several hundred men and
women, who gathered in defiance of the ban.
	   ``It's a shame that police are protecting the fundamentalists
who oppose women's empowerment,'' said Kazi Farooq Ahmed, president
of the Association of Development Agencies in Bangladesh.
	   Bangladesh has more than 1,000 agencies who offer loans as small
as 4,000 takas (dlrs 100) to more than 4 million poor village women
for small businesses such as running small grocery stores. Most of
the funds come from Western countries.
	   Predominantly Muslim Bangladesh is officially secular.

Japanese teen arrested on charges of stabbing schoolmate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A 15-year-old boy was arrested on attempted murder
charges after allegedly stabbing a schoolmate to vent his
frustrations about having to study for exams, Japanese police said.
	   The 14-year-old victim, who was stabbed several times in the
back with a knife, was hospitalized with one of her lungs
punctured, police said.
	   The suspected assailant, who was being held at a police station
in the city of Osaka, told police he had become enraged at the
sight of someone having fun and reacted by attacking the girl near
the entrance of their junior school gym, police said.
	   The boy had bought the knife about a month ago, they said.
	   Although low by Western standards, the number of juveniles
committing murder, rape and other serious crimes in Japan jumped to
2,263 in 1997, up 51 percent from the year before. The number rose
an additional 10 percent during the first half of this year.
	   Strict gun laws have limited the number of crimes committed with
firearms in Japan, but the use of knives has become more popular in
recent years among juvenile delinquents.

Female jockey dies after race fall

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from family, background, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Young mother Leigh-Anne Goodwin
became the fourth Australian woman jockey to die as a result of
injuries sustained in a race fall when her family made the
agonizing decision to switch off artificial life support machines
Monday.
	   Goodwin, 27, suffered severe head and internal injuries when she
fell from her mount Bachelor King in the Class 1 Handicap at Roma,
in western Queensland state, on Saturday. She had been wearing a
skull cap and safety vest.
	   She was airlifted 244 miles (400 kilometers) to Brisbane, but
less than 48 hours after the crash it became clear Goodwin would
not regain consciousness.
	   Goodwin had previously made clear her desire not to linger on
life support, family members said.
	   ``Just let me go,'' she'd told her parents, Mark and Barbara
Goodwin.
	   She did not want her eight-year-old son Payden to remember her
lying lifeless on a hospital bed for a prolonged period.
	   ``She always told me that if she did have a fall and anything
did happen the life support was to be switched off as soon as
possible,'' Goodwin's sister Germima said.
	   ``She didn't want to be laying there like that. She doesn't want
her son to remember her like that.''
	   Goodwin became the first female Aboriginal jockey to ride a city
winner in Australia after she rode her father's horse Getelion to
victory at Eagle Farm in September.
	   Apprentice Heidi McNiech died from head injuries sustained in a
fall at Warwick racetrack in Queensland last July. Lianne Crooke
died after an accident at Brisbane's Doomben track in 1992. Iris
Neilson died following a spill in the New South Wales town of
Lismore in 1988.
	   A total of 58 jockeys have died as a result of falls since 1933
in Australia.
	   Thoroughbred Racing Board chief steward Ray Murrihy said there
was no evidence that women riders were more at risk than men.
	   ``Women compete at the highest level in many sports, the days of
arguing against women competing in contact or high risk sports are
long gone,'' Murrihy said.

Gulf leaders gather for annual summit, oil is major issue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be lead after summit opening at 1600 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Six Gulf Arab leaders
gathered for their annual summit Monday, facing oil prices at
historic lows and a show of force from giant neighbor Iran in the
form of Gulf naval maneuvers.
	   For the first time, the summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council
is being attended by leaders outside the group. South Africa's
President Nelson Mandela and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
arrived in Abu Dhabi late Sunday.
	   Annan flew in from Libya, where he met with Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi to try to arrange the trial of two suspects in the
1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, that
killed 270 people.
	   ``We are well on the way to resolving the problem,'' Annan told
U.S. Secretary Madeleine Albright by telephone on Sunday, according
to a U.N. statement.
	   Annan has been trying to get Libya to accept a U.S.-British plan
to try the two suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the
Netherlands. Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for
failing to surrender the men for trial.
	   Mandela and Annan were apparently invited to raise the summit's
profile. The Gulf leaders were arriving Monday for the evening
opening of the summit.
	   Summit host, the United Arab Emirates, said Sunday that trying
to stabilize erratic oil prices, which are hovering at 12-year lows
of between dlrs 10 and dlrs 11, will be the main topic of
discussion at the GCC.
	   Emirates' Information Minister, Sheik Abdullah bin Zayed Al
Nahyan, told reporters in Abu Dhabi that ``oil will be an important
topic ... one of the top issues that will be discussed'' at the
summit.
	   The Gulf oil producers have been hit hard by the sharp drop in
prices. The GCC states _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman
and the Emirates _ control about half of global oil reserves. Oil
exports account for some 75 percent of their revenues.
	   Relations with Iran, their giant neighbor across the Gulf, have
been troubled since Tehran annexed three Gulf islands in 1992. The
fly-speck but strategic islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunbs and
Lesser Tunbs are also claimed by the Emirates
	   Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, deputy commander of the
Emirates armed forces, said last week that ``continued illegal
Iranian occupation of these islands'' and Iran's military power
``constitute a source of major tension,''
	   As a show of force ahead of the summit, Iran's navy and its
elite Revolutionary Guards, began five days of naval maneuvers
Friday.
	   Annan was expected to brief Gulf leaders on Security Council
sanctions on Iraq. Some GCC members, such as the Emirates, favor
lifting the sanctions to end the suffering of Iraq's people.
	   But Kuwait, whose invasion by Iraq triggered the sanctions in
1990, and Saudi Arabia, which Iraq attacked in the subsequent Gulf
War, insist that the sanctions remain until Baghdad complies with
U.N. resolutions. These call for Iraq to eliminate its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   According to Emirates officials and Western diplomats, who
insisted on anonymity, the summit was also to discuss American and
British efforts to overthrow Saddam Hussein and the U.S. plan to
set up a ``shield'' of missile batteries in the region.
	   One diplomat said the GCC states were less negative about the
shield plan than when it was presented in October. But he said the
GCC remains wary of any plan to oust Saddam, fearing it could
plunge the region into chaos and set a dangerous precedent.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with confirmation from Nissan, details of
agreement

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Nissan Motor Co. and electronics giant
Hitachi Ltd. have agreed to strengthen their ties by jointly
developing advanced technology for cars and auto components, the
companies announced Monday.
	   The cooperation will include developing technology to create the
next generation of environmentally-friendly vehicles and
intelligent transport systems, Nissan said in a statement.
	   The companies hope to produce an automated driving system
sometime after 2000 and also plan to collaborate on cutting-edge
brake systems, the statement said.
	   Hitachi is considering buying shares in Unisia JECS Corp., a
Nissan affiliate, to become the auto parts supplier's
second-largest stockholder in order to facilitate the partnership.
	   Japanese media reported Nissan and Hitachi aim to gain a
competitive edge in advanced car technologies through the
arrangement.
	   Financially-strapped Nissan hopes to reduce costs, while
Hitachi, Japan's largest electric machinery maker, plans to bolster
its presence in the auto components field, the reports said.
	   Many Japanese automakers have been forming strategic alliances
with domestic rivals and overseas car makers as Japan's recession
and economic woes in Asia push down profits.

invasion
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES 5th graf with the arrest of two protesters.
 &UR; By ANDI JATMIKO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ About 2,000 pro-independence activists
rallied peacefully Monday in East Timor on the 23rd anniversary of
the territory's invasion by Indonesian troops.
	   A United Nations envoy, meanwhile, met prominent figures in
Dili, the seaside capital of East Timor, in an effort to promote
U.N.-sponsored peace talks on the former Portuguese colony.
	   In another protest, about 100 East Timorese students blocked
traffic and chanted demands for a referendum on independence
outside the U.N. headquarters in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
	   The group chanted pro-independence slogans and waved rebel
flags. Hundreds of police later stopped them from marching to the
U.S. Embassy.
	   Two protesters were arrested after they scuffled with officers
as they tried to break through a police line about 200 meters
(yards) from the embassy.
	   ``We want to show the world that most East Timorese people want
to be separate from Indonesia,'' protester Mariano Lopez said.
	   In Dili, demonstrators prayed for those killed in the 1975
invasion of East Timor, which unleashed a long-running guerrilla
war. After several months of relative calm, sporadic fighting has
resumed in recent weeks.
	   A few activists hoisted rebel flags after a Mass at Santa Cruz
cemetery, where Indonesian troops fired on separatists in 1991,
drawing international condemnation.
	   A national fact-finding commission found at least 50 people were
killed and dozens of others were missing. Independent sources and
human rights activists put the death toll at about 200.
	   Many students at East Timor University, a center of
anti-Indonesian activism, did not demonstrate Monday because they
had exams.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 but the United Nations has
never recognized the Southeast Asian nation as the administering
power. U.N. officials are currently sponsoring peace talks between
Indonesia and Portugal, the former colonial master.
	   U.N. envoy Tamrat Samuel flew to Dili this past weekend for
talks with key players in East Timor. He has met students, human
rights activists, government and military officials and Roman
Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, co-winner of the 1996 Nobel peace
prize.
	   Samuel was scheduled to return to Jakarta on Tuesday. The U.N.
chief's personal representative for East Timor, Jamsheed Marker, is
expected to visit Dili later this month.
	   After years of human rights abuses, Indonesia softened its
stance on East Timor after former President Suharto's authoritarian
rule ended in May.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has offered a measure of
autonomy in exchange for recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over
the land of 800,000 people.

Arab League says it expects positive response soon from Libya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - The head of the Arab
League said Monday he expects a positive response from Libya on a
proposed trial of two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am
airliner over Scotland.
	   Esmat Abdel-Meguid said that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
told him earlier Monday that the Libyans still wanted some issues
clarified. He did not say what they were.
	   Annan is in Abu Dhabi to attend a summit of the Gulf Cooperation
Council that opens Monday. He arrived from Jerba, Libya, where he
met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to try to arrange the trial
of the two suspects in the bombing of Pan Am 103, which killed 270
people.
	   ``I got the impression that Mr. Annan had positive meetings in
Tripoli. There are still outstanding issues, but we are optimistic
that they will solved,'' Abdel-Meguid said, speaking before the
opening of the summit.
	   ``The Arab League is ready to cooperate to find a solution,
giving guarantees to our Libyan brothers,'' he said, without
specifying what the guarantees were.
	   Annan spoke to U.S. Secretary Madeleine Albright from his plane
on route to Abu Dhabi Sunday, a statement from his spokesperson
said.
	   ``We are well on the way to resolving the problem,'' he told her
about his discussions in Libya, the statement said.
	   ``The secretary-general noted that the Libyans had their own way
of consulting within their own reality and that they would
determine how to consult their people for a decision on the
Lockerbie issue,'' the statement said.
	   Libya People's Congress, or parliament, is scheduled to meet
Tuesday to discuss the two suspects wanted for the bombing over
Lockerbie, Scotland. Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992
for failure to turn the men over for trial.
	   In Abu Dhabi Monday, Annan also met with South Africa's
President Nelson Mandela and Azzedine Laraki, secretary-general of
the Saudi-headquartered Organization of the Islamic Conference, who
are both attending the summit.
	   The three-day summit opens Monday. Mandela and Annan are the
first leaders outside the group to attend the annual summit, which
first met in 1981. They were apparently invited to add luster to
the meeting.
	   The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and
the United Arab Emirates in a political, economic and defense
alliance.
	   GCC officials said Annan was not expected to mention his
discussions in Libya in an address to the six Gulf leaders Monday.

Thai sporting goods firm says pirates eating into profits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A leading Thai sporting goods
manufacturer says counterfeiters are reducing his company's profits
from Asian Games-related products, the Bangkok Post reported
Monday.
	   Monchai Chokepaibulkit, deputy managing director of Football
Thai Sporting Goods, said his company will lose 300 million baht
(dlrs 833,000) of profits because of fake goods from the games,
according to the Post.
	   FBT, the largest sporting goods company in Thailand, holds the
official license for Asian Games products and souvenirs.
	   Monchai told the paper that many people were choosing to buy the
pirated goods because they were cheaper. FBT's costs were higher
because it had to pay licensing fees, he said.
	   Still, the company expects to gross 1.5 billion baht (dlrs 41.6
million) in sales during the two-week Olympic-style event that
opened Sunday in Bangkok.
	   Thailand is known as a center for counterfeiting of all types.
Fake designer clothing, Rolex watches, pirated books, computer
software, movies and music are all openly sold here. Even forged
passports and other documents can be bought with little problem.
	   The United States recently removed Thailand from its
Intellectual Property Piracy Watchlist, but said the country must
still do more to crack down on rampant counterfeiting.

Hong Kong's leader says economic recovery still some time away
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Despite the recent rebound in Hong Kong's stock
and property markets, economic recovery is probably not just around
the corner, the territory's leader cautioned Monday.
	   ``Full recovery, unfortunately, may still be some time away as
far as Hong Kong is concerned,'' chief executive Tung Chee-hwa
said, speaking at a luncheon with French businessmen.
	   Tung called on Japan to take the lead in lifting the region out
of the financial malaise which first hit Asia a year ago and has
thrown Hong Kong's once-robust economy into recession.
	   ``The economic recovery of Japan is essential for us all to move
out of this difficult economic situation,'' he said.
	   Hong Kong's economy contracted 7 percent in the third quarter
this year, and is expected to contract by 5 percent for the entire
year. Unemployment is at a record 5.2 percent.
	   Despite the grim economic data, stock and property prices have
recovered slightly in recent weeks as threats that Asia's financial
contagion would spread to other parts of the world seem to have
subsided.
	   Echoing comments from other leaders in Asia, Tung also
reiterated a call for better monitoring of hedge funds' speculative
activities, which have been blamed for ushering in the collapse of
many regional currencies.
	   Tung called for more transparency from the hedge funds, but did
not offer any specific reform proposals.

Hong Kong hopeful of breaking 12-year Asian gold medal drought
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with snooker hope defeated &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Armed with an Olympic windsurfer, tiny
Hong Kong has its best chance in years of breaking a 12-year
drought in Asian Games gold medals.
	   The former British colony of 6.6 million people, which was
reintegrated into China last year, has won only one Asian Games
gold ever _ in bowling in 1986. At these Asian Games in Bangkok, it
had hopes of as many as five golds, Hong Kong delegation chief Pang
Chung said Monday. After he spoke, however, one of its gold hopes
was beaten.
	   Hong Kong's leading medal contender is windsurfer Lee Lai-shan.
Lee, known affectionately in Hong Kong as ``San San,'' won in
Atlanta in 1996, clinching Hong Kong's first gold medal in 44 years
of Olympic competition.
	   Hong Kong also had gold medal hopes for snooker player Marco Fu,
the 1997 ISBF World Snooker Champion, who reached the final of his
first professional tournament in October.
	   But Fu lost in the round of 16 Monday, falling 5-3 to Malaysia's
Ooi Chin Kay.
	   Pang, the delegation head, said Hong Kong also has chances in
women's rowing, in the Chinese martial art of wushu and in cycling,
although he conceded that Kazakstan was also ``very strong'' in
that event.
	   He said Hong Kong's 297-member delegation was ``the biggest and
also the strongest'' the territory has ever sent to an Asian Games.
``We are a force,'' Pang said.
	   Hong Kong won 12 medals _ all silver and bronze _ at the last
Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994.
	   Despite its July 1, 1997, handover to Chinese rule, Hong Kong
still competes separately from the mainland, under the title ``Hong
Kong, China.''

Yeltsin fires most top aides on his first working day after

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Yeltsin firing his aides. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Coming back to work with a bang, President Boris
Yeltsin fired most of his top aides on Monday in his first working
day at the Kremlin after a two-week hospitalization with pneumonia.
	   Yeltsin dismissed Chief of Staff Valentin Yumashev and his
deputies Yuri Yarov, Mikhail Komissar and Yevgeny Savostyanov, a
Kremlin spokesman said.
	   Nikolai Bordyuzha, former secretary of the presidential security
council, was appointed the new chief of staff, while the other
posts remain vacant.
	   The Kremlin had no immediate comment on the sudden dismissals.
	   Yeltsin has a habit of unexpected and often unexplained
dismissals. The latest round of dismissals could reflect his
unhappiness over the way some aides handled his recent
hospitalization and their unusual candidness about the president's
health.
	   Yumashev and other Kremlin aides openly said that Yeltsin is too
weak to handle day-to-day affairs or to make foreign trips and
suggested he leave control of the economy to Prime Minister Yevgney
Primakov.
	   Yeltsin insists he has no serious health problems and that he
remains in control of the government.
	   Yeltsin had all but disappeared from sight when he entered a
government hospital Nov. 22 with pneumonia, the latest in a long
string of health problems in recent years for the Russian leader.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said during the weekend
that Yeltsin was feeling better and would return, adding that the
president was ``still the most influential politician in the
country, no matter what is said about it.''
	   Many of Yeltsin's opponents claim he hasn't been seriously
involved in national affairs for a long time and is no longer fit
to lead.
	   Despite calls for his resignation, Yeltsin and his doctors
insist that the president will serve out his term, which ends in
2000.
	   Presidential aides said last week that doctors were having a
hard time persuading Yeltsin to rest and recover completely from
his illness. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov appealed to Yeltsin to
stay in hospital and complete his recovery.

Tennessee's No. 1 in AP poll, by a landslide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD ROSENBLATT  &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Tennessee's No. 1, and there's no doubt about
it.
	   The Volunteers, the only unbeaten team to survive a wild weekend
of upsets, were the unanimous choice as the top team in The
Associated Press' Top 25 final regular-season college football
poll.
	   And now it's on to the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4 for a matchup with
No. 2 Florida State with the national championship on the line.
	   Tennessee (12-0) capped off a perfect season Saturday night with
a 24-14 victory over Mississippi State in the Southeastern
Conference title game. The Vols received all 70 first-place votes
and 1,750 points from the sports writers and broadcasters on the AP
panel.
	   It was the first time this season that one team collected every
first-place vote.
	   Florida State (11-1) was the biggest winner after losses by
Kansas State and UCLA, ranked 2-3 last week, even though the
Seminoles didn't play. Florida State moved up two spots and
finished the regular season where they were ranked in the
preseason_ at No. 2.
	   Ohio State (10-1) didn't play, either, but moved up to No. 3,
while Kansas State (11-1) fell to No. 4, Arizona (11-1) moved up to
No. 5 and UCLA (10-1) dropped to No. 6.
	   In the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, Tennessee moved up to No.
1, followed by Florida State, Ohio State, Kansas State and Arizona.
	   Kansas State was beaten 36-33 in double overtime by Texas
A-and-M in the Big 12 Conference title game and UCLA was stunned by
Miami 49-45 at the Orange Bowl.
	   Since 1965, when the AP began a poll after the bowl games, every
No. 1 team winning a postseason game has won the national title.
	   Top-ranked teams are 15-15 in bowl games since '65. In 1974,
Oklahoma did not play in a bowl game, and in 1966 and '67, the AP
did not have a poll after the bowls.
	   Florida (9-2) remained No. 7, followed by No. 8 Texas A-and-M
(11-2), No. 9 Wisconsin (10-1) and No. 10 Tulane, at 11-0 the only
other major college unbeaten team.
	   Arkansas (9-2) was No. 11, followed by No. 12 Georgia Tech
(9-2), No. 13 Virginia (9--2), No. 14 Nebraska (9-3), No. 15
Michigan (9-3), No. 16 Air Force (11-1), No. 17 Notre Dame (9-2),
No. 18 Syracuse (8-3), No. 19 Georgia (8-3) and No. 20 Texas (8-3).
	   Air Force beat Brigham Young 20-13 on Saturday in the Western
Athletic Conference title game.
	   Oregon (8-3) was No. 21, followed by No. 22 Penn State (8-3),
No. 23 Missouri (7-4), No. 24 Miami (8-3) and No. 25 Mississippi
State (8-4).
	   Tennessee, ranked 10th in the preseason poll, took over the No.
1 spot from Ohio State on Nov. 8, a day after the Buckeyes lost to
Michigan State 28-24.
	   The AP will announce its national champion on Tuesday, Jan. 5,
the day after the Fiesta Bowl. The Fiesta Bowl winner automatically
becomes No. 1 in the coaches' poll.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In a startling turnaround, a key
witness whose allegations form the bulk of the sex charges against
Malaysia's jailed former No. 2 leader denied Monday that he was
ever sodomized by the ex-deputy prime minister.
	   Azizan Abu Bakar, who once worked as the driver of former deputy
premier Anwar Ibrahim's wife, had testified Anwar repeatedly forced
him into sodomy, a crime in this predominantly Muslim nation.
	   But when the trial resumed Monday after a weekend recess, the
driver told his cross-examiner in court that he had not been
sodomized.
	   Anwar is currently on trial for four counts of abuse of power.
He will be tried later on another charge of corruption and five
charges of committing illegal sex acts.
	   He has denied any wrongdoing, calling the charges part of a
high-level conspiracy to ruin his political career.
	   If the defense successfully discredits Azizan's testimony, it
could be a crushing blow for prosecutors, who have based the most
serious charge of illegal sex acts primarily on the basis of the
driver's accusations.
	   Taken aback at Azizan's retraction, defense attorney Christopher
Fernando repeated his question as a hushed silence fell on the
courtroom and everyone in attendance strained to hear the answer.
	   ``I put it to you that Anwar Ibrahim did not sodomize you and
that is why you visited him between 1992 and 1997.''
	   Azizan replied: ``Yes.''
	   Fernando then asked the court interpreter to repeat the query in
the Malay language so that there would be no doubt that Azizan
understood and that Judge Augustine Paul recorded the response.
	   The answer remained the same.
	   Surprisingly, Fernando did not press him with more questions and
prosecutors did not react.
	   Azizan's accusations have related to events in 1992 when he was
employed by Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail. He told the court last
week that shame and guilt kept him from making Anwar's alleged
repeated homosexual acts public.
	   But he did so when prompted in 1997 by Ummi Hafilda Ali, who
herself has separately accused Anwar of sleeping with her brother's
wife. Her brother was a former secretary of Anwar.
	   Azizan and Ummi retracted their accusations earlier, but at the
trial they said they were arrested and coerced by police, allegedly
at Anwar's behest, to sign retractions.
	   On Monday, Azizan said he continued to visit Anwar's house
because he was fond of his children.
	   ``I only wanted to visit his children because the children were
close to me when I was their driver.''
	   He also had said he was not angry with Anwar, but only about
being forced to have sex with him.
	   During cross-examination last week, Azizan wavered in his
testimony, prompting the defense lawyer's accusations that his
story was inconsistent and contradictory.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar on Sept. 2, saying
he had determined his one-time protege was morally unfit for
office. The sacking led to demands for political reforms and
massive anti-government protests in the normally placid Southeast
Asian capital.

Hong Kong's Fu becomes second favorite to tumble in early snooker

action &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Another snooker favorite tumbled out of
the Asian Games competition Monday, as Hong Kong's Marco Fu Ka-Chun
fell to Malaysia's Ooi Chin Kay in the men's singles round of 16.
	   Thailand's James Wattana had lost 5-1 Sunday to Hong Kong's Chan
Kwok Ming as snooker made its Asian Games debut.
	   In Monday morning's round of 16, Chan steamrollered Japan's
Shinya Egashira 5-0.
	   Ooi's hard-fought 5-3 victory over Fu elicited a rare burst of
cheers from the crowd, which otherwise greeted good shots with
brief polite applause.
	   Ooi said later he thought he and his opponent both were not at
their best, choosing instead to play a cautious game with a lot of
saving.
	   He described Fu, the only player to hold the world senior and
junior amateur titles concurrently, as ``very good and very calm.''
	   ``He is a world class player and I used all my experience to
beat him,'' Ooi said.
	   Chan said he did not feel he played up to his standard, but that
Japan's Egashira did not give him any pressure.
	   Despite his sterling performance so far, he declined to predict
his chances, saying only that he would try his best.
	   A second Malaysian also advanced Monday, when Sam Chong beat
Hung Chung-ming of Taiwan 5-2.
	   In the morning's longest match, running more than four hours,
Keith E Boon Aun of Singapore beat Guo Hua of China 5-4.
	   In other matches, Shokat Ali of Pakistan defeated Alok Kumar of
India 5-3, Yashin Merchant of India beat China's Pang Weiguo 5-1,
Al Jokar Mohammed of the United Arab Emirates bested Kuwait's Walid
Al Hatem 5-0, and Alhashemi Mohammed of the United Arab Emirates
defeated Baidandorj Batsukh of Mongolia 5-1.
	   The quarterfinals were to be played later Monday.

Former Vietnamese army officer killed during illegal logging
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A former Vietnamese army officer was
killed by forest inspectors in Khanh Hoa province while
transporting illegal timber, a local government official said
Monday.
	   Capt. Nguyen Van Thai, 33, died on the way to a hospital
Saturday night after a stray bullet hit him, an official from the
Song Cau forest control bureau said.
	   Thai, who had been dismissed from an army unit, drove into
barriers and had tried to hit the two forest inspectors as they
signaled for his car to stop, the official said.
	   One of the inspectors shot out a tire on Thai's Russian-made
car, and a stray bullet hit the former army officer in the back, he
said, adding that Thai's companion was unharmed.
	   The official said Thai had been found illegally transporting
timber in the past, and three sheets of timber were discovered in
his car.
	   The Vietnamese government has banned timber logging and timber
exports as massive logging has exhausted its forests.

Thorpe hurts back in tour match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A dejected Graham Thorpe trudged
from the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Monday clutching his
troublesome back in a severe blow to England's bid to win cricket's
Ashes.
	   Thorpe retired hurt as England enjoyed batting practice against
Victoria state on the third day of the four-day fixture.
	   At stumps, England was 207-5 in its second innings, a lead of
280 runs.
	   John Crawley (68), Mark Ramprakash (33) and Alec Stewart (36)
all played aggressively while paceman Ashley Gilbert claimed two
wickets in his first- class debut.
	   A day after fielding athletically and without obvious
discomfort, Thorpe scratched around the ground for 40 minutes
Monday to make just one run from 29 balls.
	   He retired hurt at drinks about 75 minutes before stumps.
	   The key lefthander suffered a recurrence of the injury that
forced him to
	   miss England's second-test loss to Australia in Perth.
	   England enters the third test in Adelaide starting Friday in the
knowledge Australia needs only one more win in the five-match
series to retain the symbolic Ashes urn.
	   Team manager Graham Gooch said the recurrence obviously placed
Thorpe in doubt for the Adelaide test.
	   ``He had to play in this game to prove his fitness . . . what
has happened now has got to cast doubt over his involvement in that
(Adelaide test) game,'' Gooch said.
	   England physiotherapist Wayne Morton said Thorpe felt stiffness
in his lower back 20 minutes before batting.
	   ``He really has a feeling of not being very safe in his back,''
Morton said. ``It limits him to where he is unable to move.'' (djp)

Most seats for St. Petersburg elections go to runoffs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DMITRY LOVETSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Most local legislative seats up for
grabs in Russia's second largest city of St. Petersburg will go to
runoffs after an election that was marred by bomb threats and
complaints of voter fraud.
	   Officials said Monday that just six of 50 seats were decided in
Sunday's election for the St. Petersburg legislative assembly,
while the rest will go to runoffs scheduled for December 20.
	   The six seats were all held by incumbent assembly deputies.
Candidates must get more than 50 percent of the vote to win in the
first round or the top two vote winners face each other in a second
round.
	   Liberals took a prominent lead in the first round of voting,
with 22 members of the liberal Yabloko party and nine people from
various other reform-minded parties still in the race.
	   Ten communists, as well as the city's former police chief, a
movie actress and the author of a tell-all book about the former
mayor of St. Petersburg are also still in the running.
	   Observers were eager to see how the elections would reflect
public reaction to rising crime in St. Petersburg, as well as the
Nov. 20 killing of Galina Starovoitova, a member of the Russian
parliament who supported a liberal bloc of candidates in the
elections.
	   Starovoitova supporters speculated she was killed so that her
faction, Northern Capital, would fare poorly in the election. Her
death, however, may have had the opposite effect, rallying liberal
voters.
	   In addition, hitmen have killed a legislative aide, a
high-ranking city official and a prominent banker in the last two
months.
	   Dirty politics in St. Petersburg were reflected in the
elections, which were marred by violence, racial slurs against
Jewish candidates and complaints of ballot box stuffing.
	   The City Electoral Commission also reported complaints of voter
bribery, and bomb threats forced the temporary closure of three
stations.
	   Still, voter turnout was high by Russian standards _ around 40
percent.

French scientist confirms Myanmar primate fossil find as world's
</HEADLINE>
oldest

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A team of French researchers confirmed on
Monday that fossils remains of a primate found last month in
central Myanmar are about 40 million years old, which they say
makes them the oldest in the world.
	   ``The fossilized anthropoid primates found in the Pondaung
region of central Myanmar are the oldest so far discovered,'' said
Jean Jacques Jaeger, leader of the team of paleontologists from
Montpellier University in France.
	   Jaeger said the oldest African primate fossils date back 33
million years.
	   Human beings are believed to have evolved from primitive
primates. The find sheds new light on when primates may have first
emerged. Previously, scientists believed they emerged at least 3
million years later in Asia.
	   Col. Than Tun of Myanmar's Office of Strategic Studies said that
the fossils, discovered by a joint Myanmar-Japanese team in late
November, were the jaw and teeth of monkey-like pondaungia and
amphipithecus primates.
	   ``The discovery of Pondaungia primate's complete lower jaw is an
important finding for the research and may help to solve the
challenging problem of the origin of anthropoids,'' Jaeger said.

Samaranch cautions news Australian leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ International Olympic Committee
president Juan Antonio Samaranch spoke of his ``100 percent''
support for the structure of Sydney's 2000 Summer Games organizing
committee Monday after a new Australian political leader demanded
change.
	   Kerry Chikarovski, who replaced Peter Collins as leader of the
New South Wales opposition party Monday, said she wanted the roles
of committee president and state government Olympics Minister to be
separated.
	   Labor Party member Michael Knight has both jobs but his fate
will be decided at a state election in March. Knight's dual role
has been the subject of much controversy in the host city. While
Collins said he opposed the dual role, he never confirmed the
situation would change if the conservatives take power.
	   ``We don't believe that the minister for the Olympics should be
the president of SOCOG (the committee). What we need to do is look
at the legal ramifications of doing that,'' Chikarovski said in
Sydney.
	   Samaranch, speaking at the Asian Games in Bangkok, said the
situation was essentially an internal matter, but gave a strong
indication of his position.
	   ``It's up to them but if they ask me for advice I would like
them to hold the same format as there is now,'' Samaranch said.
	   ``This closeness we have now through the government and the
organizing committee through Minister Knight is a very good one.
These days, for the success of the games, the organizing committee
must be very, very close to the government. This solution you have
in Sydney I support 100 percent.''
	   The IOC has always backed the arrangement and is happy with
Knight's performance in both roles.
	   Chikarovski also accused state premier Bob Carr of playing
politics with the games.
	   ``What really disappoints me with the premier is that he's taken
ownership of the Olympics,'' Chikarovski said.
	   Meanwhile, Samaranch said he was not concerned about renewed
calls for a boycott of the games by Aboriginal Australians.
	   ``I don't think there will be a boycott because all Australians
are very much interested in the success of the games,'' Samaranch
said.
	   The threat of boycotts was raised in some areas after SOCOG
failed to promote an Aboriginal representative to the executive
board to replace Rod McGeoch, who made an acrimonious departure
last month.

World War II bomb explodes, killing four Filipinos

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A World War II-vintage bomb dug up
from under a house exploded Monday in a central Philippine city,
killing the house's owner and three others, police said.
	   Police said carpenters digging a hole to install a septic tank
found the bomb 15 days ago under the house in Tacloban City, but
did not report it to authorities.
	   The owner of the house called three friends Monday to try to
open the bomb, hoping they could sell the gunpowder inside, a
police investigator said.
	   The 1,000-pound bomb went off as the men were tinkering with it,
instantly killing them and destroying the house.
	   U.S. and Japanese bombs still turn up around the country more
than 50 years after the end of World War II.
	   Tacloban, 575 kilometers (360 miles) southeast of Manila, is in
Leyte province, where U.S. forces heavily bombarded Japanese
occupation troops in the final days of the war.

Beijing gives low-key assessment of Taiwan election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In a low-key response to Taiwan's weekend
elections, China said Monday it respected the desire of Taiwanese
people for autonomy but opposed any moves toward independence.
	   A statement issued by the government's top office for Taiwan
affairs was China's first reaction to the Nationalist Party's win
in legislative and mayoral elections on Saturday.
	   ``We fully respect the lifestyles of the Taiwan compatriots and
their desire and right to be the masters of their own house. At the
same time we oppose Taiwan's breakaway forces and using democracy
as an excuse to engage in activities to split the country,'' the
statement said.
	   The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, or Cabinet,
added: ``We welcome visionary people in Taiwan to work hard to
promote unification of the motherland.''
	   China and Taiwan separated in 1949 after a civil war between the
Communists and the Nationalists. Beijing claims the island as a
rebel province, demands eventual reunification and vows to meet any
declaration of independence with military force.
	   The Nationalists stand for eventual reunification with a
democratic China, while the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
at least nominally supports independence.
	   In the elections, Nationalist challenger Ma Ying-jeou defeated
DPP incumbent Chen Shui-bian as mayor of the capital city, Taipei.
The Nationalists also held onto the legislature, taking 123 of 225
seats, compared to the 70 won by the DPP.
	   Chinese newspapers on Monday paid little attention to Saturday's
elections. The People's Daily, the Communist Party's main
newspaper, ran a brief story about the election results on an
inside page.
	   All references to the titles of mayors and legislators were in
quotation marks, a standard practice which underscores Beijing's
refusal to acknowledge a separate government in Taiwan.
	   The state-run Yangcheng Evening News in a brief commentary
decried the influence of money in the elections, a typical
criticism from Beijing of Taiwan's democracy.
	   The newspaper said the election made it possible to ``see
through'' Taiwan's ``so-called democratic politics.'' It did not
provide examples of how money may have distorted election results.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin also taking personal control over justice
ministry and tax police in new graf 8, NEW details throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Coming back to work with a bang, President Boris
Yeltsin fired most of his top aides on Monday in his first working
day at the Kremlin after a two-week hospitalization with pneumonia.
	   Yeltsin dismissed Chief of Staff Valentin Yumashev and his
deputies Yuri Yarov, Mikhail Komissar and Yevgeny Savostyanov, a
Kremlin spokesman said.
	   Nikolai Bordyuzha, the secretary of the presidential security
council, was appointed the new chief of staff, while the other
posts remain vacant. Bordyuzha, who will serve in both posts, was
chief of the Border Guards before his appointment to the post
earlier this year.
	   The Kremlin had no immediate comment on the sudden dismissals.
	   Yeltsin has a habit of unexpected and often unexplained
dismissals. The latest round of dismissals could reflect his
unhappiness over the way some aides handled his recent
hospitalization and their unusual candidness about the president's
health.
	   The Russian media has said that the passive and defeatist aides
were further eroding Yeltsin's power. The dismissed aides handled
the workings of the Kremlin and the president's routine and had
considerable influence.
	   Yumashev and other Kremlin aides openly said that Yeltsin is too
weak to handle day-to-day affairs or to make foreign trips and
suggested he leave control of the economy and other current affairs
to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   On Monday, Yeltsin also took personal control of the justice
ministry and tax police _ two key government structures previously
under Primakov's command. The move was clearly aimed at
strengthening Yeltsin's authority, although its immediate
implications remain unclear.
	   Yeltsin insists he has no serious health problems and that he
remains in control of the government.
	   Yeltsin had all but disappeared from sight when he entered a
government hospital Nov. 22 with pneumonia, the latest in a long
string of health problems in recent years for the Russian leader.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said during the weekend
that Yeltsin was feeling better and would return, adding that the
president was ``still the most influential politician in the
country, no matter what is said about it.''
	   Many of Yeltsin's opponents claim he hasn't been seriously
involved in national affairs for a long time and is no longer fit
to lead.
	   Despite calls for his resignation, Yeltsin and his doctors
insist that the president will serve out his term, which ends in
2000.
	   Presidential aides said last week that doctors were having a
hard time persuading Yeltsin to rest and recover completely from
his illness. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov appealed to Yeltsin to
stay in hospital and complete his recovery.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Phannarong Kongsamut gave host Thailand
its first gold medal of the Asian Games with victory in the men's
mountain bike downhill race at Kaoyai Rimthan Resort on Monday.
	   Japan's Sachiko Kamakura and Mami Masuda swept the top two
places in the women's race later.
	   Kongsamut won the men's race in 3 minutes, 43.13 seconds.
Takashi Tsukamoto of Japan won silver in 3:44.79 with Brian Cook of
Hong Kong third in 3:57.65.
	   In the women's race, Kamakura won by more than 17 seconds,
finishing in 4:26.49. Masuda was second in 4:44.15, and Taiwan's
Chen Ju-miao took the bronze in 4:54.18.
	   For mountain biking's Asian Games debut, the downhill races were
run near Khao Yai National Park, Thailand's first and one of its
largest. The park is rich forest habitat for wild elephants and
tigers.

Report: Chiang Kai-shek's grandson may run for vice president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The ruling Nationalist Party's victory in
Taiwan's weekend elections could further boost the political career
of John Chang, the party's secretary general and grandson of late
leader Gen. Chiang Kai-shek, a local report said Monday.
	   The China Times Express reported that Chang, who took over
control of the party following its defeat in local elections last
year, may be named Vice President Lien Chan's running mate in
Taiwan's presidential election in 2000.
	   Chang did not comment on the report when he visited Gen.
Chiang's tomb on Monday in Tsehu, a secluded suburb 18 miles (30
kms) south of Taipei.
	   The illegitimate son of the late Nationalist President Chiang
Ching-kuo, Chang is a former foreign minister and vice premier.
	   Gen. Chiang led his Nationalist followers to Taiwan in 1949
after losing a civil war in China. He was succeeded by his son,
Ching-kuo, after his death in 1975.
	   In Saturday's elections, the Nationalists maintained control of
the national legislature, taking 123 of 225 seats, compared to just
70 won by the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party.
	   Voters also chose Nationalist Ma Ying-jeou to replace incumbent
Chen Shui-bian of the DPP as mayor of Taipei.
	   The outcome defied earlier predictions that the 104-year-old
Nationalist Party would do badly because of scandals and corruption
and it reflected public acceptance of the party's pledge to carry
out reforms.
	   Analysts also attributed the party's success to Chang's efforts
to mobilize factional support, naming capable candidates and
putting on a lively campaign to change its stern image.
	   Chang said the election victory reaffirmed the party's
conviction that it will win the presidential election in 16 months.

Report: Outlook gloomy for Singapore's beleaguered electronics
</HEADLINE>
industry

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Despite recent expectations that Singapore's
long-suffering electronics industry is nearing recovery, local
manufacturers fear the downturn will last another half year, a
newspaper reported Monday.
	   Recent indications that a global electronics slump was abating
may have caused premature optimism in Singapore, reported The
Business Times.
	   Sentiment among investors in Singapore stocks and in the local
business community has improved recently, due in part to increased
optimism in regional markets and government initiatives to slash
business costs.
	   The hard-disk drive industry, a major part of Singapore's vital
manufacturing sector, has also enjoyed a burst of demand after a
prolonged slump.
	   But the continuing Asian crisis and persistent torpor in many
foreign electronics markets have begun to weigh heavily again on
Singapore's industry, the newspaper said.
	   Many Singapore-based electronics manufacturers see little growth
during the first half of 1999, according to the business daily.
	   They cited a tenacious global slump in demand for computer
chips, which also form a significant portion of Singapore's
electronics output, it said.
	   There has also been less pickup in overall electronics demand
during this year's Christmas season than expected, the report said.
	   Singapore's economy relies primarily on its manufacturing
output, and electronics account for about 70 percent of non-oil
domestic exports in this trade-driven Southeast Asian business hub.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES 5th graf with release of arrested protesters.

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ About 2,000 pro-independence activists
rallied peacefully Monday in disputed East Timor on the 23rd
anniversary of the territory's invasion by Indonesian troops.
	   A United Nations envoy, meanwhile, met prominent figures in
Dili, the seaside capital of East Timor, in an effort to promote
U.N.-sponsored peace talks on the former Portuguese colony.
	   In another protest, about 100 East Timorese students blocked
traffic and chanted demands for a referendum on independence
outside the U.N. headquarters in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
	   The group chanted pro-independence slogans and waved rebel
flags. Hundreds of police later stopped them from marching to the
U.S. Embassy.
	   Two protesters were arrested after they scuffled with officers
as they tried to break through a police line about 200 meters
(yards) from the embassy. They were later released after the
demonstrators agreed to disperse.
	   ``We want to show the world that most East Timorese people want
to be separate from Indonesia,'' protester Mariano Lopez said.
	   In Dili, demonstrators prayed for those killed in the 1975
invasion of East Timor, which unleashed a long-running guerrilla
war. After several months of relative calm, sporadic fighting has
resumed in recent weeks.
	   A few activists hoisted rebel flags after a Mass at Santa Cruz
cemetery, where Indonesian troops fired on separatists in 1991,
drawing international condemnation.
	   A national fact-finding commission found at least 50 people were
killed and dozens of others went missing. Independent sources and
human rights activists put the death toll at about 200.
	   Many students at East Timor University, a center of
anti-Indonesian activism, did not demonstrate Monday because they
had exams.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 but the United Nations has
never recognized the Southeast Asian nation as the administering
power. U.N. officials are currently sponsoring peace talks between
Indonesia and Portugal, the former colonial master.
	   U.N. envoy Tamrat Samuel flew to Dili this past weekend for
talks with key players in East Timor. He has met students, human
rights activists, government and military officials and Roman
Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, co-winner of the 1996 Nobel peace
prize.
	   Samuel was scheduled to return to Jakarta on Tuesday. The U.N.
chief's personal representative for East Timor, Jamsheed Marker, is
expected to visit Dili later this month.
	   After years of human rights abuses, Indonesia softened its
stance on East Timor after former President Suharto's authoritarian
rule ended in May.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has offered a measure of
autonomy in exchange for recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over
the land of 800,000 people.

Spain's jobless figure drops to 11.03 for November
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Jobless claims in Spain fell to 11.03
percent of the active population in November from 11.11 percent in
October, the Labor Ministry said Monday.
	   The ministry said it was the lowest jobless rate registered for
the month since 1981. At the end of November, a rounded 1.80
million people had filed for unemployment insurance, basically
unchanged from October, the ministry said.
	   The ministry said that while the number of jobless in November
rose by 826 people from October, the percentage was lower for
November given changes in the overall size of the workforce.
	   Analysts watch the statistics institute's quarterly unemployment
data more closely than the ministry's monthly jobless-claims
figures believing it gives a better idea of the total number of
people out of work, rather than just those eligible for benefits.
	   Recent quarterly figures put unemployment at just over 19
percent.

Dollar up against yen in Tokyo, Japanese stocks close higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with late dollar, bond, other details.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Continued optimism about the outlook for the U.S.
economy sent the dollar higher against the yen on Monday. Japanese
stock prices closed moderately higher.
	   The dollar bought 118.96 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.64
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
level of 118.95 yen on Friday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 83.52 points,
or 0.57 percent, to close the day at 14,723.49. On Friday, the
average closed down 57.11 points, or 0.39 percent.
	   The U.S. currency had dipped early in the morning on a Japanese
media report that U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin had
expressed a desire to resign. But the dollar later recovered as
traders covered short positions.
	   ``Without reports in other media (on Rubin's possible
resignation), traders bought back dollars,'' said Kazuhito
Furukawa, a trader at Nippon Credit Bank.
	   Analysts said that with a lack of other market-moving news,
traders pushed up the dollar on the strength of data released in
Washington last week showing the continued resilience of America's
economic boom.
	   The Labor Department said Friday the U.S. jobless rate fell to
4.4 percent in November, the lowest since April and May, when the
unemployment rate dipped to a 28-year low of 4.3 percent.
	   ``The focus shifted from the report to the relatively good U.S.
jobs data released Friday,'' Furukawa said.
	   During Friday trading in New York, the dollar moved to the
mid-119 yen level following the release of strong U.S. economic
data, but the currency slipped back later on some worries about
sluggish South American economies.
	   Lingering concerns about a new bout of financial troubles in
Brazil blunted the dollar's rise Monday in Tokyo trading as well,
traders said.
	   The dollar ranged between 118.23 yen and 119.27 yen in Monday's
trading.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices were buoyed by
Friday's gain of 136.46 points, or 1.5 percent, in the Dow Jones
industrial average. The Dow advanced on the strong employment
report, which provided fresh evidence of strength in the U.S.
economy.
	   Traders said, however, that activity was light as investors
continued to monitor developments concerning the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party's efforts to solidify a coalition with the
opposition Liberal Party.
	   The coalition was expected to lead to new economic stimulus
measures, as the Liberal Party favors tax reforms to boost the
economy.
	   But in Parliament on Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi declined to say if he would honor an agreement forged with
the Liberals to cut taxes by 10 trillion yen (dlrs 84.06 billion).
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section rose 4.28 points, or 0.38 percent, to close at 1,125.00.
The TOPIX fell 8.17 points, or 0.72 percent, on Friday.
	   Volume was low Monday, with an estimated 239.68 million shares
changing hands on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
compared to 344.53 million shares Friday. Advances outnumbered
declines 696 to 402, while 179 issues were unchanged.
	   The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond rose to
1.060 percent from Friday's finish of 1.045 percent, driving its
price down to 106.38 yen from 106.58 yen.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Six years after leading a bloody coup
attempt, Hugo Chavez rode a wave of fierce public discontent to win
Venezuela's presidency by the largest margin in 40 years.
	   The lower classes that Chavez championed celebrated wildly in
the streets after Sunday's victory. Across the country, they honked
horns, set off fireworks and shouted ``Chavez! Chavez!'' Many
donned the winner's trademark red beret.
	   Terrified by his fiery populist rhetoric, Chavez's opponents had
branded the cashiered lieutenant colonel a dictator-in-waiting,
poised to impose a socialist regime.
	   Chavez tried Sunday evening to salve the wounds of a divisive
campaign that often took on overtones of class warfare.
	   ``I don't have even a millimeter of hate or rancor in my
heart,'' he told tens of thousands of supporters, some of them
fighting off tears, in downtown Caracas.
	   Standing above a 90-foot (30-meter) Venezuelan flag, the former
army paratrooper vowed ``to rebuild the country'' and call a
referendum to rewrite the constitution. But he also declared
himself a fiscal conservative and said he would streamline
Venezuela's bloated bureaucracy.
	   In a two-hour news conference, Chavez, 44, also offered to work
with ``willing and able'' politicians from Venezuela's two
traditional parties, the center-left Democratic Action and the
center-right COPEI.
	   Both parties, blamed by most Venezuelans for squandering the
world's largest oil reserves outside the Middle East, withdrew
their candidates last week to rally behind Henrique Salas Romer,
the Yale-educated former state governor Chavez defeated handily
Sunday.
	   With 78 percent of the votes counted, Chavez had 56.5 percent to
39.5 percent for Salas, according to official results, and turnout
was high for Venezuela at 65 percent.
	   Jubilant supporters poured into the streets to celebrate what
they considered a triumph of the masses over a political elite that
has failed to ease poverty and eradicate corruption.
	   On Nov. 8, Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition won a
plurality of Congress in Nov. 8 regional elections, erasing the
traditional parties' political dominance.
	   At his news conference, Chavez said the post-election euphoria
reflected more than a personal victory.
	   ``In truth, I'm not Chavez. Chavez is a national feeling. Chavez
is a project,'' he told reporters, repeatedly invoking dictums from
independence leader Simon Bolivar.
	   He acknowledged, however, that there could be no quick fix for
Venezuela's problems: plummeting living standards and corruption
are deeply ingrained in government and business.
	   ``I don't believe the Venezuelan people think I am a messiah,
some kind of magician,'' he said.
	   Chavez said he would not impose exchange controls or other
radical economic measures, as his opponents have claimed. He said,
however, that he would seek to restructure Venezuela's dlrs 21
billion foreign debt, which eats up 30 percent of the national
budget.
	   The president-elect also promised to cut government spending,
seek ways to increase the minimum wage, currently at dlrs 1.75, and
end rampant tax evasion.
	   In 1992, Chavez led a failed coup attempt by 15,000 rebel
soldiers. Dozens of people died in the attempt, though the actual
number was never clear. Jailed, he was pardoned two years later.
	   The United States denied Chavez a visa last year, but a
victorious Chavez said he expected tensions with Washington to
subside by the time he takes office Feb. 2.
	   Venezuela is the number one exporter of oil to the United
States.
	   The Chavez victory was ``fueled by rabid discontent, the violent
fall of our currency, the rise in the cost-of-living and the hunger
in millions of Venezuelan homes,'' commented ex-President Carlos
Andres Perez, whom Chavez had tried to overthrow in 1992.
	   Many considered Chavez's rise a red warning flag for Latin
America, where the gulf between rich and poor is the widest of any
region in the world.
	   An economic crisis caused by a 12-year low in oil prices has
made making ends meet all but impossible for most Venezuelans,
whose living standards have been in steady decline for more than 15
years.
	   Chavez's militaristic rhetoric terrified upper crust Venezuela,
and many wealthy people have fled to Miami.
	   ``He's a crazy man on the loose, a communist,'' said Elena
Alamos, an elderly woman casting her vote in Caracas's upper-class
Altamira district.

Russia's Defense Ministry will owe 25 billion rubles on Jan 1.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Defense Ministry will owe weapons makers
and others more than 25 billion rubles (dlrs 1.25 billion) by Jan.
1 for maintenance of the country's weapons arsenal, a news report
said Monday.
	   Over half of that sum will be the ministry's debt for weapons
maintenance and purchases, said Col. Gen. Anatoly Sitnov, the head
of the armament department of the armed forces, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   The Defense Ministry will owe another 7.8 billion (dlrs 350
million) for research and development, and 3 billion (dlrs 150
million) for repairs, he said.
	   Sitnov also said a preliminary draft of the government's defense
spending in 1999, at 90 billion rubles (dlrs 4.5 billion), would
not be nearly enough to train troops or purchase spare parts and
fuel.
	   ``Modernization or purchased of advanced hardware are out of the
question with this budget draft,'' he said, according to Interfax.
	   Sitnov called for the government to dedicate 3.5 percent of the
Gross Domestic Product to military spending. The proposed 1999
draft calls for military spending of 2.6 percent.
	   Russia's military has suffered heavy funding cuts since the
collapse of the Soviet Union. Much of its equipment is out-of-date
or doesn't work properly, and soldiers often receive inadequate
training and endure atrocious living conditions.

Government lawyers said to be ``careful'' in investigating Suharto
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's attorney general shrugged
off accusations on Monday that he has been too soft on former
President Suharto, saying he needs to be extra careful in his
investigation of corruption allegations against the ex-leader.
	   Attorney General Andi Mohammad Ghalib, who plans to question
Suharto on Wednesday, said the retired president had not been named
as a suspect despite mounting calls by student protesters and
others that he be tried for alleged graft and human rights abuses.
	   ``We have to be careful and not carelessly say that he is a
suspect,'' Ghalib told a committee of lawmakers in Parliament.
	   ``We should not be careless, otherwise (our investigations)
could be reversed,'' he said.
	   Suharto, 77 was forced to quit last May after a wave of protests
and riots. Since then, his opponents, including students activists,
have demanded that he be prosecuted.
	   Suharto has denied accusations that he illegally enriched
himself, his family and cronies during his 32-year rule.
	   Earlier this year Forbes magazine estimated Suharto's wealth at
dlrs 4 billion. However, he has flatly denied claims that he has
stashed a fortune away in foreign bank accounts.
	   Ghalib questioned Suharto several months ago during an earlier
investigation that failed to find any evidence against the former
president.
	   Suharto's successor and onetime protege, President B.J. Habibie,
last week ordered Ghalib to step up his investigation after a new
wave of student protests in the capital city.
	   In a written submission to Parliament, Ghalib said Suharto had
handed over seven charitable foundations worth dlrs 530 million
that were established during his three decades in power.
	   Also, Ghalib's office has checked about 70 banks in Indonesia
and found five bank accounts in Suharto's name worth 23.3 billion
rupiah (dlrs 3.1 million).
	   He said Suharto owned about 10 hectares of land in the capital
city, Jakarta, 30 hectares in Yogayakarta and 265,984 hectares of
forest on the island of Borneo.
	   ``Currently, we are investigating whether those assets were
acquired illegally,'' Ghalib said.

At least 10 killed in fighting in southern Somali port town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ At least 10 people were killed and
more than 15 wounded in clashes between rival militiamen in the
southern Somali port town of Merca, reports from the town said
Monday.
	   Fighting between rival subclans of the Habar Gidir clan erupted
Sunday in downtown Merca, about 100 kilometers (65 miles) south of
the capital Mogadishu, forcing markets in the area to close and
continuing into the night, according to witnesses contacted by VHF
radio.
	   Three people were killed and five wounded during an early
exchange between the rival Eyr and Sa'ad subclans, which control
different parts of Merca, witnesses said.
	   Later in the evening, fighting intensified around the hospital,
where a prominent militiaman was being treated for wounds suffered
earlier in the day. Another seven people, including at least one
woman bystander were killed and 10 wounded, the reports said.
	   A U.N. World Food Program ship, which was off-loading food aid
at the Merca port at the time, was not affected by the fighting,
witnesses said. An agency spokesman could not immediately be
reached Monday.
	   It was unclear what sparked Sunday's clashes, but it may have
been connected to clashes between the same factions two months ago
at Shalambod, a town 15 kilometers (10 miles) north of Merca.
	   Sunday's fighting followed the visit Saturday of an
international peace delegation which included Italy's ambassador to
Somalia. The port town is a large export-import hub for Italian
businessmen.
	   The delegation's visit to Merca angered faction leaders
controlling Mogadishu, who had expected the international
representatives to pay respects to them in the capital before going
to other towns.
	   Faction leaders Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Hussein Mohamed Aidid,
former rivals who joined forces recently to set up a municipal
administration for Mogadishu, announced Saturday that the
delegation was unwelcome and ordered it to leave.
	   It was unclear whether the delegation was still in Merca Sunday,
or if their visit had anything to do with the outbreak of
hostilities.
	   Aidid belongs to the Habar Gidir clan.
	   A demonstration of Aidid and Ali Mahdi supporters in Mogadishu
Sunday burned Italian flags and accused Italian Ambassador
Francesco Shortino of undermining efforts to reunite the formerly
divided capital.
	   Somalia has been wracked by clan fighting and civil war since
faction leaders collaborated in 1991 to oust President Mohamed Siad
Barre, but afterwards turned on each other.
	   Somalia has since been without a central government, and carved
into faction-controlled fiefdoms protected by fighting militiamen.

Samaranch opposes joint bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ International Olympic Committee
president Juan Antonio Samaranch said Monday it was too late for
Poland and Slovakia to consider a joint bid to stage the 2006
Winter Olympics.
	   A clearly surprised Samaranch was unaware of Polish news reports
Sunday saying Polish and Slovak Olympic committees had raised the
prospect of a joint bid on Sunday.
	   ``Poland and Slovakia together? It's too late,'' Samaranch said
at a news conference at the Asian Games.
	   ``We have six bids from Europe and we will be meeting about it
next week. Now to change the bids would be too late.''
	   The decision to put in a joint bid is an effort to appease
ecologists who fear damage to Poland's national mountain reserve.
	   They have protested against plans to cut thousands of fir trees
in the southern Tatra National Park to groom slopes for the
Olympics. That opposition was among the main concerns of the IOC
evaluation commission that visited Poland last month.
	   Poland's favorite skiing resort, Zakopane, near the country's
southern border with Slovakia, is bidding to stage the 2006 Winter
Olympics. As part of Sunday's agreement, Slovakia's Chopok
mountain, also in the Tatra range, would be the site of the
downhill, according to a Polish news report. The report said
Zakopane is ready to share some other events with Slovakia.
	   The report would put Slovakia in contention for three of the six
bids.
	   But Slovakia is supposedly supporting a bid from Poprad Tatry.
The other four candidates are Helsinki, Finland; Sion, Switzerland;
Turin, Italy; and a joint bid of Klagenfurt in Austria, Planica in
Slovakia and Tarvisio in Italy.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Despite recent expectations that Singapore's
long-suffering electronics industry is nearing recovery, local
manufacturers fear the downturn will last another half year, a
newspaper reported Monday.
	   Recent indications that a global electronics slump was abating
may have caused premature optimism in Singapore, reported The
Business Times.
	   Sentiment among investors in Singapore stocks and in the local
business community has improved recently, due in part to increased
optimism in regional markets and government initiatives to slash
business costs.
	   The hard-disk drive industry, a major part of Singapore's vital
manufacturing sector, has also enjoyed a burst of demand after a
prolonged slump.
	   But the continuing Asian crisis and persistent torpor in many
foreign electronics markets have begun to weigh heavily again on
Singapore's industry, the newspaper said.
	   Many Singapore-based electronics manufacturers see little growth
during the first half of 1999, according to the business daily.
	   They cited a tenacious global slump in demand for computer
chips, which also form a significant portion of Singapore's
electronics output, it said.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Despite the recent rebound in Hong Kong's stock
and property markets, economic recovery is probably not just around
the corner, the territory's leader cautioned Monday.
	   ``Full recovery, unfortunately, may still be some time away as
far as Hong Kong is concerned,'' chief executive Tung Chee-hwa
said, speaking at a luncheon with French businessmen.
	   Tung called on Japan to take the lead in lifting the region out
of the financial malaise which first hit Asia a year ago and has
thrown Hong Kong's once-robust economy into recession.
	   ``The economic recovery of Japan is essential for us all to move
out of this difficult economic situation,'' he said.
	   Hong Kong's economy contracted 7 percent in the third quarter
this year, and is expected to contract by 5 percent for the entire
year. Unemployment is at a record 5.2 percent.
	   Despite the grim economic data, stock and property prices have
recovered slightly in recent weeks as threats that Asia's financial
contagion would spread to other parts of the world seem to have
subsided.
	   Echoing comments from other leaders in Asia, Tung also
reiterated a call for better monitoring of hedge funds' speculative
activities, which have been blamed for ushering in the collapse of
many regional currencies.
	   Tung called for more transparency from the hedge funds, but did
not offer any specific reform proposals.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Nissan Motor Co. and electronics giant
Hitachi Ltd. have agreed to strengthen their ties by jointly
developing advanced technology for cars and auto components, the
companies announced Monday.
	   The cooperation will include developing technology to create the
next generation of environmentally-friendly vehicles and
intelligent transport systems, Nissan said in a statement.
	   The companies hope to produce an automated driving system
sometime after 2000 and also plan to collaborate on cutting-edge
brake systems, the statement said.
	   Hitachi is considering buying shares in Unisia JECS Corp., a
Nissan affiliate, to become the auto parts supplier's
second-largest stockholder in order to facilitate the partnership.
	   Japanese media reported Nissan and Hitachi aim to gain a
competitive edge in advanced car technologies through the
arrangement.
	   Financially-strapped Nissan hopes to reduce costs, while
Hitachi, Japan's largest electric machinery maker, plans to bolster
its presence in the auto components field, the reports said.
	   Many Japanese automakers have been forming strategic alliances
with domestic rivals and overseas car makers as Japan's recession
and economic woes in Asia push down profits.

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The world's tallest tower _ if you
count the communications antenna on top _ is to be built in
Melbourne, nudging out Toronto's CN Tower by just over 19 1/2 feet
(six meters).
	   The CN Tower in Toronto, Canada has laid claim to the world's
tallest structure since it was built in 1976 and stands at 1,815
feet (553.3 meters), including its communications antenna.
	   But under international rules measuring buildings, antennas do
not count toward the height of the building.
	   Purists who spurn antennae on their skyscrapers consider the
1,483-foot (452-meter) Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, completed
in 1996, the world's tallest building.
	   Chicago's Sears Tower, at 1,450 feet (442 meters), held the
title from 1973 until 1996.
	   Victorian state Premier Jeff Kennett announced Monday that the
Grollo tower concept had won the bid for the Docklands site on
Melbourne's western fringe.
	   He said the Grollo Group had four months to prove its financial
capacity and to satisfy conditions set by the Docklands Authority.
	   The 1,837-foot (560-meter) obelisk, estimated to cost up to 1.5
billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 930 million), will include
120 floors of apartments, a luxury hotel and offices.
	   Even though its main structure _ solar power collectors and
mechanical rooms _ would stop at the 1,640-foot (500-meter) level,
that would be higher than the Petronas Towers.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's textile industry lost 3.6 billion yuan
(dlrs 430 million) in the first 10 months of this year, despite
laying off half a million workers, the official China Daily
reported Monday.
	   State-owned textile factories are suffering from a decline in
exports as a result of the Asian financial crisis and a sluggish
and glutted domestic market. Textiles have been one of the hardest
sectors to revive in a nationwide reforms of debt-ridden,
overstaffed state industries.
	   Bankruptcies helped hold losses to 3.6 billion yuan (dlrs 430
million) between Jan.-Oct., 1.3 billion yuan (dlrs 160 million)
less than in first 10 months of 1997, the China Daily reported,
citing the State Bureau of Textile Industry.
	   About 100,000 more textile workers are scheduled to lose their
jobs by the end of the year. Most textile workers are women who do
not have other job skills.
	   Textile exports dropped 5.26 percent in the first nine months of
the year compared with the same period last year. The newspaper
quoted Du Yuzhou, director of the State Textile Bureau, as saying
state companies were trying to export more to European and American
markets and improve efficiency.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney had reinforced its position as
the finance capital of Australia with France's largest bank
deciding to expand its headquarters in the city, New South Wales
state Premier Bob Carr said Monday.
	   Banque Nationale du Paris (BNP) last week leased 107,600 square
feet (10,000 square meters) in the Castlereagh Street office tower
as the site for its expanded Australian headquarters, Carr said.
	   ``Sydney is indisputably the finance and business capital of
Australia and New South Wales controls more financial assets than
the rest of Australia put together,'' Carr said.
	   ``Sydney is the only city in Asia whose markets are still
operating as the European markets begin and has the second biggest
futures market in Asia.''
	   Carr said the New South Wales economy had continued to attract
international investment despite the Asian economic crisis.
	   BNP was the longest established foreign bank in Sydney,
operating in Australia since 1881.
	   Since January 1997, the bank had increased its Australian work
force from 360 to 560, with almost 450 of those jobs in New South
Wales, Carr said.

Philippine leader forms anti-smuggling task force
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
has ordered the creation of a powerful task force to combat
large-scale smuggling and customs fraud, officials said Monday.
	   Smuggling has become rampant because large swaths of the
country's extensive coastline are virtually unguarded. The
Philippine navy and coast guard are among Asia's most poorly
equipped.
	   Corruption is also rampant at Manila's customs bureau.
	   Estrada signed an executive order establishing the Presidential
Anti-Smuggling Task Force, which will include officials from the
police, military intelligence, finance and the internal revenue
bureau, the officials said.
	   It will be headed by a deputy director of the National Bureau of
Investigation and supervised directly by Estrada's office.
	   Estrada also ordered the creation of special teams of government
prosecutors and investigators to speed up prosecution of suspected
smugglers.
	   In July, Estrada formed a special task force against organized
crime, mainly to curb widespread kidnappings, drug trafficking, car
theft, illegal logging, gun running, counterfeiting, and bank
fraud. That task force has had limited success so far.
	   Estrada, who took office June 30, promised to make law and order
a cornerstone of his six-year term.

At least 10 killed in fighting in southern Somali port town

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ At least 10 people were killed and
more than 15 wounded in clashes between rival militiamen in the
southern Somali port town of Merca, reports from the town said
Monday.
	   Fighting between rival subclans of the Habar Gidir clan erupted
Sunday in downtown Merca, about 100 kilometers (65 miles) south of
the capital Mogadishu, forcing markets in the area to close and
continuing into the night, according to witnesses contacted by
radio.
	   Three people were killed and five wounded during an early
exchange between the rival Eyr and Sa'ad subclans, which control
different parts of Merca, witnesses said.
	   Later in the evening, fighting intensified around the hospital,
where a prominent militiaman was being treated for wounds suffered
earlier in the day. Another seven people, including at least one
woman bystander were killed and 10 wounded, the reports said.
	   It was unclear what sparked Sunday's clashes, but it may have
been connected to clashes between the same factions two months ago
at Shalambod, a town 15 kilometers (10 miles) north of Merca.

Yemen: Amicable solution to border dispute with Saudi possible
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Yemen has not given up hope for an ``amicable and
peaceful'' solution for its border dispute with Saudi Arabia, its
foreign minister said in remarks published Monday.
	   ``We have not yet reached the point of despair ... or a closed
door,'' Abdul-Qader Bajamal, who also serves as deputy premier,
told Kuwait's Al-Siyassah daily.
	   ``There is still hope for reaching an amicable and peaceful
solution'' before having to resort to arbitration, the Yemeni
official said.
	   Yemen, on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula, has long contested
Saudi Arabia's claim to three Red Sea islands and parts of the
Empty Quarter, a vast desert region with potentially lucrative oil
fields. The two nations have yet to demarcate their border.
	   Frustrated by lack of progress in talks, Yemen has said it would
consider seeking international arbitration.
	   But Bajamal said that while arbitration would ``close the files
of the past,'' an amicable solution reached by the two sides
themselves would ``lay the foundations for the future.''
	   Fighting has occasionally erupted along the 2,000-kilometer
(1,300-mile) frontier between the two countries.

Netanyahu: Can't stop Clinton from visiting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, reflecting
growing Israeli unease over U.S. President Bill Clinton's upcoming
visit, suggested Monday that the trip was entirely at the
initiative of the American leader.
	   ``What am I going to tell him, not to come _ don't come? I can
prevent him from coming?'' Netanyahu asked rhetorically in an
interview on army radio. ``We're not accustomed to refusing someone
who wants to come.''
	   The United States has repeatedly said Clinton's planned stop in
the Gaza Strip, the first by a sitting U.S. president, is not
intended as an endorsement of Palestinian statehood aspirations,
but the Palestinians see it as a powerful boost to their
sovereignty hopes.
	   On Monday, speaking to reporters in Gaza, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat hailed the upcoming trip as ``historical and great.''
	   The presidential visit to Israel and the Palestinian lands is
meant to encourage both sides to stick to the timetable set out in
the Wye River accords signed in October.
	   However, Netanyahu said Clinton's trip ``has value only if he
strengthens the Palestinian fulfillment of their obligations''
under the agreement.
	   In recent weeks, Israel and the Palestinians have accused one
another of failing to live up to various provisions, and Israel has
threatened to hold off on a scheduled Dec. 18 troop pullback.
	   Palestinians, for their part, are angry over stepped-up Jewish
settlement activity in the West Bank and Israel's failure to free
hundreds of so-called security prisoners, jailed for anti-Israel
activity.
	   Israel released the first 250 of a promised 750 Palestinian
prisoners last month, but they were mainly criminals, not security
prisoners as the Palestinians have demanded.
	   In response, Palestinians have been staging protests that have
repeatedly boiled over into violent street clashes. More
demonstrations were taking place in several West Bank towns on
Monday.
	   Also, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners were continuing a hunger
strike begun over the weekend.
	   The controversy over Clinton's visit also comes as Netanyahu is
trying to quell a potential parliamentary rebellion. Opposition
from within the coalition to Israel's ceding of West Bank land has
forced Netanyahu to seek new allies to prop up his government.
	   A vote on early elections was possible later Monday, but the
prime minister's opponents may not push the issue forward if they
lack the votes.
	   Netanyahu has been sparring publicly with his former foreign
minister, David Levy, who considered rejoining the shaky governing
coalition in exchange for the finance minister's job.
	   The prime minister said the two couldn't agree on economic
principles and that he wouldn't sacrifice Israel's economy to
coalition politics.
	   The Clinton visit has added to tensions within the government.
At Sunday's Israeli Cabinet meeting, a shouting match broke out
over it, according to Israel radio.
	   ``Who invited President Clinton to the Gaza Strip?'' Silvan
Shalom, the science minister, reportedly yelled at Netanyahu.
Netanyahu said it had been Clinton's idea, not his.
	   In Gaza, Clinton is to be on hand for a meeting at which
Palestinians will reaffirm the nullifaction of clauses in their
national charter calling for Israel's destruction.

Two top South Korean conglomerates agree on dlrs 10 billion swap
</HEADLINE>
deal
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By KYONG-HWA SEOK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Samsung, South Korea's second-largest
conglomerate, said Monday it would swap its fledgling automobile
subsidiary for Daewoo Group's home appliance businesses.
	   The dlrs 10 billion deal was the highlight of plans announced by
the heads of the nation's top five conglomerates to sharply pare
the number of affiliates that each controls.
	   In all, the Samsung, Hyundai, Daewoo, LG and SK groups said they
would spin off at least 130 of their 264 subsidiaries in a move to
raise some 20 trillion won (dlrs 16.6 billion).
	   If successful, the sales, mergers and swaps would allow each of
the giant groups to lower debt levels to twice their equity by the
end of l999. Some now have debt almost six times equity.
	   The announcement came after leaders of the five conglomerates
met with President Kim Dae-jung, who has been pressing them for
months to restructure their bloated, overlapping empires.
	   Analysts generally hailed the announcement, but some questioned
whether the conglomerates can find buyers for many of their
money-losing affiliates.
	   Some of those affiliates have been kept afloat for years only
through cross-funding and debt guarantees by other businesses
within their group.
	   ``To reduce the debt-capital ratio, they have to sell a huge
amount of assets or increase their capital drastically in a short
period of time,'' said Yoon Kun-young, an economics professor at
Yonsei University.
	   ``Only foreign investors have that much money and I don't think
they would just rush to buy everything in the market.'' he said.
	   Except for the announced swap between Samsung and Daewoo,
Monday's announcement contained nothing new beyond a pledge by the
conglomerates to carry out the restructuring.
	   They have made similar promises in the past, but backed away
from taking action. The government said it will closely monitor
enforcement this time.
	   If the conglomerates fail to make good on their pledges,
government-controlled creditor banks will call in loans and cut off
credit, officials said.
	   With dlrs 2.7 billion in 1997 sales, Daewoo Electronics Co. is
South Korea's No. 2 home appliance maker after Samsung Electronics.
It runs 28 assembly plants in England, Poland, France, Mexico and
other countries.
	   Daewoo Motor Co., South Korea's No. 2 auto maker, will take over
Samsung Motors, the nation's newest and smallest car manufacturer.
The swap will leave the country with but two auto makers, Daewoo
and Hyundai Motors, which recently absorbed bankrupt Kia Motor
Corp.
	   ``The swap is extra good news to boost foreign investors'
confidence in the battered South Korean economy,'' said On Ki-sun,
an analyst at Dongwon Securities Co.
	   ``South Korea's overcrowded car industry and electronics
industry will slim down to become more competitive in the domestic
and international markets,'' On added.
	   Even before the announcement, sentiment was bullish on the
Korean stock market, buoyed by a decision by Moody's Investors
Services Inc. last week to upgrade South Korea's won-denominated
bonds by three steps.
	   Moody's move also raised hope that South Korea's sovereign
rating may be upgraded soon as well from junk to investment grade.
	   At the day's end, share prices skyrocketed 4.9 percent to 514.52
points, the second highest so far this year after a 521.62 point
surge on March 21.
	   ``The restructuring, especially the swap deal between Samsung
and Daewoo, has influenced the market very positively. I believe it
will further help attract foreign investors to the market,'' said
Cho Woo-kyu, an analysts at Shinhan Securities Co.
	   A restructuring of South Korea's ailing conglomerates, or
chaebol, was a key condition of a dlrs 58 billion bailout of the
country's economy by the International Monetary Fund last year.
	   South Korea's chaebol thrived on cozy relations with past
military governments under a system of cross-funding and cross-loan
payment guarantees among subsidiaries.
	   That system allowed a single chaebol to control 40 to 60
cross-funded subsidiaries, making everything from computer chips to
cars, ships and garments.
	   But about a dozen conglomerates collapsed under mounds of bad
bank loans last year, fueling the nation's financial crisis.
	   A typical case of such reckless expansion was Samsung's entry
into South Korea's already saturated car market in 1996. With an
annual capacity of 80,000 cars, the company already has run up a
dlrs 2 billion deficit.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Cesar Baldaccini, the sculptor best-known for
compressing cars into huge blocks of twisted steel, has died of
cancer at his Paris home, French media reported early Monday. He
was 77.
	   Cesar, as the artist is known, died at his home on Sunday,
French radio and television said.
	   The sculptor ``was a man who didn't see any difference between
life and creativity itself,'' Pierre Restany told French television
LCI.
	   Born Jan. 1, 1921 in Marseille, Cesar studied at the Beaux-Arts
schools in his native city as well as in Paris. He quickly sought
to differentiate himself from his instructors by using auto bodies
and scrap metal.
	   A member of the New Realism movement, Cesar created ``compressed
automobiles,'' and he ``sculpted'' other objects by striking them
with a sledgehammer.
	   Cesar also created the statuette used as France's Oscar to award
the country's cinema greats. The award, first given in 1976, is
called the Cesar.
	   ``He always had this way of starting from nothing to rebuild the
world,'' said former Culture Minister Jack Lang, speaking on Europe
1 radio.
	   President Jacques Chirac, paying homage to the artist, said in a
statement that Cesar's art was both ``demanding'' and ``insolent.''
	   Calling Cesar a friend, the president added that his death ``is
an immense loss for our culture, for our country and also for those
who loved him.''
	   Funeral arrangements were pending.

 &UR; CUBA: Cuba says Castro `criticisms' of Mexico were misinterpreted &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cuba is trying to quell a diplomatic row with
Mexico, saying reporters misinterpreted Fidel Castro when they
quoted him as saying Mexicans traded in their historic heroes for
Mickey Mouse.
	   The Mexican Foreign Relations Ministry had demanded Friday that
Cuba explain criticism of Mexico's relationship with the United
States, which Mexico City newspapers had attributed to Castro.
	   The daily El Universal reported that the Cuban president had
said Mexico was turning its back on poor Latin American nations and
that many Mexicans would sooner be able to say who Mickey Mouse was
than name the father of their country.
	   A statement from the Cuban Embassy in Mexico said Castro's
comments, made Wednesday ``in a discreet and familiar environment''
during a gathering of Latin American economic leaders in Cuba, had
been taken out of context and ``absolutely misinterpreted.''
	   The statement said Castro's comment about Mickey Mouse, a
popular cartoon character, was not a criticism of Mexicans but a
remark on the overwhelming cultural dominance of the U.S.
entertainment industry.
	   If many Mexican children were asked to name their country's
founders ``it is possible that many of them would not know, but
they would instead know who is Mickey Mouse, who are all of the
principal characters of the animated cartoons coming from the
United States; and the same thing occurs in the rest of Latin
America,'' Castro said.
 &UR; HAITI: Haitian-American killed on trip
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A Haitian-American from Boston who
returned to his home island for a vacation was shot and killed by
robbers who took his shoes, the victim's sister says.
	   Rulx ``JJ'' Damas, 33, of Boston's Dorchester section, was
killed in the attack while driving with his father and girlfriend
in the Santos area near the capital of Port-au-Prince on Thursday,
according to his sister Melissa Damas.
	   A Haitian security official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, confirmed that the killing occurred, but provided few
details.
	   Rulx Damas' girlfriend, Esther Gaugette, and his father,
Francois Damas, survived by lying on the ground and playing dead,
Ms. Damas said.
	   Gaugette described the attack in a phone call to a Boston
television station: ``I just heard somebody tap on the window. They
started breaking windows. They were shooting at the car,'' she
said. ``I thought JJ was pretending he was dead. I didn't realize
he was shot.''
	   Ms. Damas said the robbers then looted the car.
	   ``They took everything,'' she said. ``My father has diabetes.
They took his insulin, I mean, what can you do with insulin? They
took the shoes off my brother's feet.''
	   Frico Damas, the victim's brother, said that it took an
ambulance more than an hour to arrive. His father and girlfriend
have been put up in a hotel by officials with the U.S. Embassy
while they try to leave the country, she said.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Eighth electric worker dies
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ An electric worker has died while
handling a line in the southern Puerto Rican town of Yauco,
bringing to eight the number of linemen killed while repairing
hurricane-damaged lines.
	   Alexander Sinigaglia Gonzalez, 36, died Saturday while trying to
lift a downed 110-volt line, police said Sunday.
	   His colleague, Javier Huerta Vega, 27, tried to help Sinigaglia
and suffered severe burns. Huerta remained in a Yauco hospital in
critical condition Sunday. Three other workers were unhurt.
	   Yauco and other southern communities were worst hit by Hurricane
Georges on Sept. 21, and many pockets are still without
electricity. Last week, the city of Ponce said it was dedicating
its city festival this year to electric workers who have died while
repairing lines.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Water and sewer utility workers to strike in Puerto
Rico
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ About 5,000 water and sewer workers
in Puerto Rico say they will stage a 24-hour strike Monday to
protest a breakdown in negotiations for a new labor contract.
	   The workers are demanding a new contract before a private
company, Professional Services Group, takes over most management of
the government's Aqueduct and Sewer Authority in January. The
company already handles the the utility's customer service
department.
	   The agency said Sunday most disruptions would be in requests for
service and repair of water lines.
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello has called the strike an attempt to disrupt
campaigns just before a Dec. 13 vote on Puerto Rico's future
relationship with the United States.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Television station sues over campaign ad
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A Puerto Rican television station
is suing Gov. Pedro Rossello's party over footage of a news
reporter in an advertisement advocating U.S. statehood for the
island.
	   WAPA-TV Televicentro, San Juan's Channel 4, claims the ad
implies that reporter Luis Guardiola endorses U.S. statehood in an
upcoming vote on Puerto Rico's relationship with the United States.
	   It filed suit against Rossello's New Progressive Party on Friday
in San Juan Superior Court, the San Juan Star newspaper reported.
Lawyers are asking a judge for an order to stop running the ad.
	   The Dec. 13 vote asks Puerto Ricans to choose between statehood,
independence, independence with treaty ties to the United States,
continued commonwealth or ``none of the above,'' a protest vote.
	   The ad shows an interview with San Juan mayor Sila Calderon in
which she calls it ``absurd'' for opponents of statehood to vote
for ``none of the above.'' Calderon has since changed her mind.
	   Guardiola is shown interviewing her, then summarizing her
comments during a newscast.
	   WAPA claims the ad used its footage, logo and trademark without
permission. It claims its newscast's commercial value depends on
not being affiliated with any political party, and that the ad
implies Guardiola supports the statehood position.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Dominican immigrant among 32 Rhodes scholars
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A list of 32 Americans winning Rhodes
scholarships Saturday includes a Dominican immigrant, officials
say.
	   Winner Jose D. Vargas of Gaithersburg, Maryland is a senior at
Loyola College of Maryland who emigrated to this country from the
Dominican Republic with his family before he entered high school.
Vargas developed his deep interest in science while learning
English;
	   Rhodes scholarships provide two or three years study at the
University of Oxford in England. The Rhodes scholarships, oldest of
the international study awards available to American students, were
created in 1902 by the will of Cecil Rhodes, British philanthropist
and colonial pioneer.
	   With the selections announced late Saturday, 2,854 American
students have won Rhodes scholarships since the first selection in
1903. The 32 recipients were chosen from 909 applicants endorsed by
310 colleges and universities. Ninety-six applicants from 67
colleges and universities reached the final stage of the
competition.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Barreling downhill near a park where
elephants and tigers roam, mountain bike racer Phannarong Kongsamut
gave host Thailand its first gold medal of the 13th Asian Games
Monday.
	   The hosts gained a second gold in the team event of women's air
rifle shooting, putting them into a tie with Japan for the early
gold medals lead.
	   Japan gained its two from a victory Monday in the women's
mountain bike race and a near-world record Sunday in the women's
marathon, the games' first gold medal race.
	   Asian powerhouse China had just two bronzes so far, but was
likely to gain gold in the swimming pool and the gymnastics hall
later Monday.
	   South Korea's Kim Jung-mi edged Thailand's T. Pupiromchaikul
498.6 to 496.6 for gold in individual women's air rifle shooting,
and her team took silver behind the Thais, 1,178 to 1,171.
	   Kongsamut won the men's mountain bike race in 3 minutes, 43.13
seconds, with Takashi Tsukamoto of Japan second in 3:44.79 and
Brian Cook of Hong Kong third in 3:57.65.
	   In the women's race, Sachiko Kamakura and Mami Masuda gave Japan
a 1-2 sweep, although Kamakura was more than 17 seconds ahead in
4:26.49. Taiwan's Chen Ju-miao took the bronze in 4:54.18.
	   For mountain biking's Asian Games debut, the downhill races were
run near Khao Yai National Park, Thailand's first and one of its
largest. The park is rich forest habitat for wild elephants and
tigers.
	   Snooker, also making its games debut, lost its second favorite
in two days Monday. After the defeat Sunday of Thailand's James
Wattana, Malaysia's Ooi Chin Kay beat Hong Kong's Marco Fu Ka-Chun
5-3 Monday. Fu is the only player to hold the world senior and
junior amateur titles concurrently.
	   But Hong Kong's Chan Kwok Ming, the man who ousted Wattana,
moved into the quarterfinals by beating Japan's Shinya Egashira
5-0.
	   For the equestrian events, Iran's riders are borrowing horses
from the Indonesian team to compete here after their own horses
were sent back by the games' veterinary commission because they
lacked the required vaccinations.
	   After learning that Indonesia had three reserve horses available
for borrowing, Iran decided Saturday to send its five riders, who
have arrived at the competition site at an army cavalry base in
Saraburi province, an hour's drive north of Bangkok.
	   Only three riders will compete and only in the show jumping.
	   ``The Iranian riders have shown the high spirit of athletes.
They want to take part even though they have to ride another team's
horses and they told me that they want to have a good time and the
horses to have fun,'' said Siraya Chunekamrai, president of the
games' Veterinary Commission.

	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - The head of the Arab
League said Monday he expects a positive response from Libya on a
proposed trial of two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am
airliner over Scotland.
	   Esmat Abdel-Meguid said that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
told him earlier Monday that the Libyans still wanted some issues
clarified. He did not say what they were.
	   Annan is in Abu Dhabi to attend a summit of the Gulf Cooperation
Council that opens Monday. He arrived from Jerba, Tunis, after a
meeting in Libya Saturday with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to try
to arrange the trial of the two suspects in the bombing of Pan Am
103, which killed 270 people.

General strike greets Indian prime minister in Kashmir

	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Groups opposed to Indian rule in Kashmir
shut down the state's capital for the second day Monday with a
general strike called to protest a visit by the prime minister.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, meanwhile, was 180
kilometers (110 miles) north of Srinagar visiting Tundar, a border
area that has been heavily damaged by Pakistani shells in the
almost routine exchanges of fire between India and Pakistan.
	   Shops were closed and only a few private cars defied the general
strike call in Srinagar on the last day of Vajpayee's two-day
visit, his first to the state since taking office earlier this
year.
	   Sunday, police said explosives hidden in a public toilet
shattered windows of houses and hotels less than three kilometers
(two miles) from the state governor's guest house where Vajpayee
was staying. The small explosion was a reminder militants can still
disrupt life in Srinagar, though the government has declared the
uprising largely subdued.
	   The militants say Muslim-majority Kashmir should not be part of
India, which is predominantly Hindu and officially secular. Several
groups are fighting Indian forces, with some demanding independence
and others union with officially Islamic Pakistan. More than 15,000
people have been killed in the fighting in the last nine years.
	   India accuses Pakistan of arming and training the militants, but
Pakistan says it lends them only moral support. The two countries
have fought two wars over the Himalayan territory in the past 51
years and still regularly skirmish across the Kashmir border. India
controls two-thirds of Kashmir and Pakistan the rest; both
countries claim all of Kashmir.
	   Vajpayee said India would never give up its claims on Kashmir.
	   ``We will thwart all such attempts by our adversaries until the
last breath,'' he was quoted as saying in Tundar, 180 kilometers
(110 miles) north of Srinagar, capital of Indian-held Kashmir
state. ``We will guard our borders at all costs. We will not allow
even an inch of our land to go ....''

Shares in Hong Kong surge on rate cuts, Wall Street rebound
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES thruout with closing figures.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong surged Monday,
boosted by unexpected rate cuts in both Hong Kong and China and a
sharp rebound on Wall Street Friday.
	   The blue chip Hang Seng Index rose 465.68 points, or 4.7
percent, closing at 10,428.82. On Friday, the index had lost 83.01
points.
	   Turnover amounted to 6.22 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
797 billion), up from Friday's 4.51 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 578 million).
	   On Friday, leading Hong Kong banks announced they were cutting
their prime lending rate, the rate reserved for their most
creditworthy customers, to 9.25 percent from 9.50 percent.
	   The interest rate cut came as good news for the property and
bank sectors because it was expected to spur purchases by potential
homebuyers attracted to cheaper mortgage offers.
	   Mainland China also reduced interest rates by 0.5 percent on
average effective Monday, lifting China-related shares on the Hong
Kong stock exchange.
	   ``The rate cut in Hong Kong and China, and the sharp rise on
Wall Street are all good news for the local market,'' said Peter
Lai, a director at OCBC Securities (HK) Ltd.
	   On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 135.46 points
to 9,016.14.
	   Among property stocks, Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 3.25 Hong
Kong dollars to 58.50, and Cheung Kong rose also rose 3.25 dollars
to 56.50.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings rose 10.00 dollars to
196.00, and Hang Seng Bank rose 4.00 dollars to 69.25.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa rose 3.25 dollars to 55.00, and
Swire Pacific ``A'' rose 36.30.

Philippine peso falls sharply; stocks end mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso fell sharply
against the dollar in heavy trading Monday, as participants
continued to buy the U.S. currency on the belief it had been
oversold in recent trading, dealers said.
	   Stocks were mixed at the end of a volatile session with thin
trading.
	   Traders said Monday's dollar buying was prompted by speculation
that the dollar was oversold at any level below 39 pesos.
	   The dollar averaged 39.313 pesos for the day, up 1.1 percent
from Friday's average of 38.880 pesos. It traded in a range of
39.130 pesos to 39.420 pesos.
	   Traders noted that market players started to lower their offer
rates for the dollar in afternoon trading, with the dollar last
traded at 39.210 pesos.
	   Weaker regional currencies also weighed on the peso, traders
said.
	   The central bank was not active in the spot market. It held its
overnight borrowing and lending rates at 13.375 percent and 15.375
percent, respectively.
	   On the stock market, the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange
Index rose 11.72 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,834.36. But decliners
outnumbered gainers 53 to 37, while 49 issues were unchanged.
	   Traders said the market opened on a relatively strong note, but
immediately gave way to profit-taking, especially on blue-chip
stocks, which were among the top gainers Friday. On Friday the
index rose 15.61 points, or 0.9 percent.
	   Other issues, however, attracted some bargain-hunters who took
their cue from the 136.46-point gain posted by the Dow Jones
Industrial Average Friday.
	   ``Trading was very volatile, but there was hardly any volume.
Everybody is still uncertain of the direction the market will take
in the near term,'' said Fitzgerald Aklan, assistant vice president
for institutional sales of Orion-Squire Securities Inc.
	   The B shares of the country's top power distributor, Manila
Electric Co., were among the most actively traded issues, rising 7
pesos, or 6.1 percent, to 121 pesos.
	   Aklan said the shares rose on speculation following a newspaper
report Monday that said Filipino-Chinese tycoon Lucio Tan, chairman
of Philippine Airlines, is eying taking control of Meralco.
	   The weak peso also contributed to the mixed performance of
Manila shares, traders said.`

Members of international counterfeiting ring arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) - Three members of an international ring
trying to market dlrs 5 million in counterfeit U.S. dollars were
arrested while a fourth believed to be an American managed to
escape, police said Monday.
	   The three arrested were identified as Abdulnasser Lutfi Hanafi,
28, a Sudanese; Charles Odiri, 26, a Nigerian; and Ibrahim Ali
Khaled, 33, a Lebanese.
	   They were arrested Sunday in the resort of Maameltein, 25 miles
(15 miles) north of Beirut, after a car chase in which shots were
fired in the air and two policemen were slightly injured, a police
official said, speaking under customary condition of anonymity.
	   The fourth man escaped. An American passport found in his hotel
room had the name Tony Scott, 36, of Chicago, police said. They
said dlrs 5 million in expertly printed, forged U.S. 100 dollar
bills were found in the room.
	   The English-language newspaper The Daily Star said
anti-counterfeit officers from the U.S. Embassy in Nicosia, Cyprus,
were flying in Monday to help in the investigation.

Sequel to last year's Soros vs. Mahathir clash

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ It's time for Part II of Malaysia
vs. George Soros.
	   It premiered over the weekend, slightly more than one year after
the first vitriolic show when the international financier was
singled out by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad as the villain
behind Malaysia's economic woes.
	   Now Soros has angered not only Malaysian officials but also some
opposition members of Parliament by favoring Mahathir's
resignation.
	   The sequel started when Soros told a U.S. audience last week
that Malaysians should turn against their prime minister because
his policies are aimed at benefiting himself and his cronies.
	   ``I think what needs to happen is he (Mahathir) needs to be
removed from power,'' Soros said at the Johns Hopkins University.
	   On Monday, when an opposition legislator asked a question about
Soros' remarks in Parliament, a government minister called Soros a
Jew commenting about a predominantly Muslim nation.
	   ``I'm very disappointed that an MP from an Islamic party does
not believe in a Muslim prime minister and is more inclined to
believe in Soros, a Jew whom we know is always looking for means to
destroy us,'' said Mohd. Nazri Aziz, a minister in Mahathir's
office, according to the national news agency Bernama.
	   Last year, Mahathir villainized Soros, blaming his ``Jewish
agenda'' for Malaysia's turmoil in its financial markets. Mahathir
later denied he had made anti-Semitic remarks.
	   On Monday, major pro-government, English-language papers carried
long articles containing statements against Soros, the 68-year-old
financier and philanthropist who often promotes democracy and open
societies.
	   ``What Soros did to the Asian economies was as cruel as what
Adolf Hitler did in Europe,'' said Sanusi Junid, the chief minister
of the northern state of Kedah, according to the Star newspaper.
	   Another official compared Soros to U.S. Vice President Al Gore,
who criticized Mahathir's government during last month's
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit in Malaysia.
	   ``First it was Al Gore and now it is Soros. Obviously they are
frustrated with our stabilizing economy because this is not what
they want to see,'' said Chan Kong Choy, the junior Cabinet
minister for energy and communications.
	   The remarks worried the Malaysian opposition, who felt it could
become convenient for Mahathir, 72, to band them together with
Soros and Gore as people who were opposed to his 17-year-rule and
thereby weaken the opposition's struggle.
	   ``Soros has no understanding of psychology, and he should keep
his mouth shut if he wants to see Dr. Mahathir and (Mahathir's)
Barisan Nasional government toppled,'' said Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat
of Parti Islam SeMalaysia, the only opposition leader to head a
state.
	   The party, together with several liberal opposition groups, is
campaigning for Mahathir's removal in the wake of the public outcry
over the firing and imprisonment of vice prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim in September.
	   Anwar, who started a reform movement to oust Mahathir, is being
tried on charges of illegal sex and corruption. He has accused
Mahathir of firing and falsely accusing him because the prime
minister was threatened by his growing popularity.
	   ``Since we have also been calling for Dr. Mahathir to step down,
it is as if we are bowing to or following the demands of Soros,''
said Nik Abdul Aziz.

Members of international counterfeiting ring arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Three members of an international ring
trying to market dlrs 5 million in counterfeit U.S. dollars were
arrested while a fourth believed to be an American managed to
escape, police said Monday.
	   The three arrested were identified as Abdulnasser Lutfi Hanafi,
28, a Sudanese; Charles Odiri, 26, a Nigerian; and Ibrahim Ali
Khaled, 33, a Lebanese.
	   They were arrested Sunday in the resort of Maameltein, 25 miles
(15 miles) north of Beirut, after a car chase in which shots were
fired in the air and two policemen were slightly injured, a police
official said, speaking under customary condition of anonymity.
	   The fourth man escaped. An American passport found in his hotel
room had the name Tony Scott, 36, of Chicago, police said. They
said dlrs 5 million in expertly printed, forged U.S. 100 dollar
bills were found in the room.
	   The English-language newspaper The Daily Star said
anti-counterfeit officers from the U.S. Embassy in Nicosia, Cyprus,
were flying in Monday to help in the investigation.

Yeltsin fires during a brief visit from hospital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin returning to hospital &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Briefly returning to work with a bang, President
Boris Yeltsin fired most of his top aides on Monday during a quick
trip to the Kremlin.
	   Yeltsin immediately returned to the government hospital where he
has been for the past two weeks. Aides said the president was
continuing treatment for pneumonia.
	   Yeltsin dismissed Chief of Staff Valentin Yumashev and his
deputies Yuri Yarov, Mikhail Komissar and Yevgeny Savostyanov, a
Kremlin spokesman said.
	   Nikolai Bordyuzha, the secretary of the presidential security
council, was appointed the new chief of staff, while the other
posts remain vacant. Bordyuzha, who will serve in both posts, was
chief of the Border Guards before his appointment to the post
earlier this year.
	   The Kremlin had no immediate comment on the sudden dismissals.
	   Yeltsin has a habit of unexpected and often unexplained
dismissals. The latest round of dismissals could reflect his
unhappiness over the way some aides handled his recent
hospitalization and their unusual candidness about the president's
health.
	   The Russian media has said that the passive and defeatist aides
were further eroding Yeltsin's power. The dismissed aides handled
the workings of the Kremlin and the president's routine and had
considerable influence.
	   Yumashev and other Kremlin aides openly said that Yeltsin is too
weak to handle day-to-day affairs or to make foreign trips and
suggested he leave control of the economy and other current affairs
to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   On Monday, Yeltsin also took personal control of the justice
ministry and tax police _ two key government structures previously
under Primakov's command. The move was clearly aimed at
strengthening Yeltsin's authority, although its immediate
implications remain unclear.
	   Yeltsin insists he has no serious health problems and that he
remains in control of the government.
	   Yeltsin had all but disappeared from sight when he entered a
government hospital Nov. 22 with pneumonia, the latest in a long
string of health problems in recent years for the Russian leader.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said during the weekend
that Yeltsin was feeling better and would return, adding that the
president was ``still the most influential politician in the
country, no matter what is said about it.''
	   Many of Yeltsin's opponents claim he hasn't been seriously
involved in national affairs for a long time and is no longer fit
to lead.
	   Despite calls for his resignation, Yeltsin and his doctors
insist that the president will serve out his term, which ends in
2000.
	   Presidential aides said last week that doctors were having a
hard time persuading Yeltsin to rest and recover completely from
his illness. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov appealed to Yeltsin to
stay in hospital and complete his recovery.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A fire broke out in a retirement home outside Paris
before dawn Monday, killing seven people and injuring 36 others, 10
seriously, authorities said.
	   The blaze began at about 4 a.m. (0300 GMT) in Livry-Gargan in
the northern working-class suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis,
firefighters said.
	   In a northern Paris neighborhood, another fire left three people
dead and 13 hurt, three seriously, firefighters said.
	   That blaze broke out at about 3 a.m. (0200 GMT), and 150
firefighters with 43 trucks took an hour to knock it down, the
officials said on customary anonymity.
	   The fire, in the 9th district near Montmartre, began in a
staircase and spread to the fourth, fifth and sixth floors,
officials said.
	   The cause of both blazes was under investigation.
	   According to the all-news television station LCI, the nursing
home fire may have been started by a short circuit in an electric
bed. The source of that information was not immediately known.
	   Health Minister Bernard Kouchner visited the town hall at
Livry-Gargan to meet with local officials.
	   The mayor of the town, Alain Calma, said on LCI that the nursing
home was built in 1965, before new building standards were set. A
commission is to examine whether the building is in conformity with
current norms, he said.

Arab League says it expects positive response soon from Libya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more Abdel-Meguid comments in grafs 6-8 &QL; 
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The head of the Arab
League said Monday he expects a positive response from Libya on a
proposed trial of two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am
airliner over Scotland.
	   Esmat Abdel-Meguid said that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
told him earlier Monday that the Libyans still wanted some issues
clarified. He did not say what they were.
	   Annan is in Abu Dhabi to attend a summit of the Gulf Cooperation
Council that opens Monday. He arrived from Jerba, Tunis, after a
meeting in Libya Saturday with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to try
to arrange the trial of the two suspects in the bombing of Pan Am
103, which killed 270 people.
	   ``I got the impression that Mr. Annan had positive meetings in
Tripoli. There are still outstanding issues, but we are optimistic
that they will solved,'' Abdel-Meguid said, speaking before the
opening of the summit.
	   ``The Arab League is ready to cooperate to find a solution,
giving guarantees to our Libyan brothers,'' he said, without
specifying what the guarantees were.
	   Abdel-Meguid said that he also discussed with Annan the
importance of lifting U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   He felt a serious willingness from Annan to help solve problems
facing the Arab world, including the Israeli occupation of southern
Lebanon and the sanctions against Libya and Iraq.
	   ``We trust him and what he is doing and what his conscience
dictates to him,'' Abdel-Meguid said, referring to Annan.
	   Annan spoke to U.S. Secretary Madeleine Albright from his plane
on route to Abu Dhabi Sunday, a statement from his spokesperson
said.
	   ``We are well on the way to resolving the problem,'' he told her
about his discussions in Libya, the statement said.
	   ``The secretary-general noted that the Libyans had their own way
of consulting within their own reality and that they would
determine how to consult their people for a decision on the
Lockerbie issue,'' the statement said.
	   Libya People's Congress, or parliament, is scheduled to meet
Tuesday to discuss the two suspects wanted for the bombing over
Lockerbie, Scotland. Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992
for failure to turn the men over for trial.
	   In Abu Dhabi Monday, Annan also met with South Africa's
President Nelson Mandela and Azzedine Laraki, secretary-general of
the Saudi-headquartered Organization of the Islamic Conference, who
are both attending the summit.
	   The three-day summit opens Monday. Mandela and Annan are the
first leaders outside the group to attend the annual summit, which
first met in 1981. They were apparently invited to add luster to
the meeting.
	   The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and
the United Arab Emirates in a political, economic and defense
alliance.
	   GCC officials said Annan was not expected to mention his
discussions in Libya in an address to the six Gulf leaders Monday.

Hungary expects to be admitted to NATO in March
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary will be given membership in
NATO in March, Defense Minister Janos Szabo was cited as saying on
Monday.
	   ``According to the latest reports we have, Hungary will be a
full member of NATO in March,'' Szabo said, according to state
radio.
	   There was no word from Poland and the Czech Republic _ the other
two former Soviet bloc nations expected to join the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization next year. But with membership for all three
considered a package, the Hungarian announcement indicated that the
other two would also be offered full NATO status in March.
	   The three had been expected to be given full membership in April
at a Washington ceremony marking the organization's 50th birthday.
Szabo's announcement appeared to confirm speculation that the date
would be changed to avoid slighting Russia, which also will be
attending the anniversary ceremonies.
	   Moscow opposes expansion of NATO and is particularly against its
former allies becoming members.

Key witness raises doubts about testimony in Anwar trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details.
 &UR; By R. MAGESWARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In a startling turnaround, a key
witness whose allegations form the bulk of the sex charges against
Malaysia's jailed former No. 2 leader denied Monday that he was
ever sodomized by the ex-deputy prime minister.
	   Azizan Abu Bakar, who once worked as the driver of former deputy
premier Anwar Ibrahim's wife, had testified Anwar repeatedly forced
him into sodomy, a crime in this predominantly Muslim nation.
	   But when the trial resumed Monday after a weekend recess, the
driver told his cross-examiner in court that he had not been
sodomized.
	   Anwar is currently on trial for four counts of abuse of power.
He will be tried later on another charge of corruption and five
charges of committing illegal sex acts.
	   He has denied any wrongdoing, calling the charges part of a
high-level conspiracy to ruin his political career.
	   If the defense can discredit Azizan's testimony, it could be a
crushing blow for prosecutors, who have based the most serious
charge of illegal sex acts primarily on the basis of the driver's
accusations.
	   Taken aback at Azizan's retraction, defense attorney Christopher
Fernando repeated his question as a hushed silence fell on the
courtroom and everyone in attendance strained to hear the answer.
	   ``I put it to you that Anwar Ibrahim did not sodomize you and
that is why you visited him between 1992 and 1997.''
	   Azizan replied: ``Yes.''
	   Fernando then asked the court interpreter to repeat the query in
the Malay language so that there would be no doubt that Azizan
understood and that Judge Augustine Paul recorded the response.
	   The answer remained the same.
	   Surprisingly, Fernando did not press him with more questions and
prosecutors did not react.
	   Azizan's accusations have related to events in 1992 when he was
employed by Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail. He told the court last
week that shame and guilt kept him from making Anwar's alleged
repeated homosexual acts public.
	   But he eventually did so when prompted in 1997 by Ummi Hafilda
Ali, who herself has separately accused Anwar of sleeping with her
brother's wife. Her brother was a former secretary of Anwar.
	   Azizan and Ummi retracted their accusations last year, but at
the trial they said they were arrested and coerced by police,
allegedly at Anwar's behest, to sign retractions.
	   On Monday, the driver said he had signed a second retraction in
August because he was forced to by Anwar's supporters. But Azizan
did not complain to the police about it until Anwar was fired, he
had said, because he was scared.
	   But a meeting with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad about 10 days
before Anwar was fired emboldened him to go public with his
accusations, Azizan said.
	   ``I also gained confidence after meeting the honorable prime
minister who said he would carry out a thorough investigation,'' he
said.
	   Azizan said he continued to visit Anwar's house because he was
fond of his children.
	   ``I only wanted to visit his children because the children were
close to me when I was their driver,'' he said.
	   During cross-examination last week, Azizan wavered in his
testimony, prompting the defense lawyer's accusations that his
story was inconsistent and contradictory.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar on Sept. 2, saying
he had determined his one-time protege was morally unfit for
office. The sacking led to demands for political reforms and
massive anti-government protests in the normally placid Southeast
Asian capital.
	   Anwar's case attracted international attention when he first
appeared in court with a black eye and bruises from a police
beating.
	   On Monday, Azizah Ismail, Anwar's wife, demanded that a
government report on the probe into his beating be made public by
the attorney general's office.
	   The report was submitted by the police to the attorney general,
the government's chief judicial officer, several weeks ago. but has
yet to be publicly released.

U.S. health secretary backs Lebanon's new administration

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of Health and Human
Services Donna Shalala on Monday gave America's strong backing to
Lebanon's new president, saying his government was full of
``promise and enthusiasm.''
	   Shalala's statement of support for the new government could help
allay fears of investors nervous about the fate of the postwar
reconstruction process after the sudden political changes of the
last week.
	   The Lebanese-American official, making her second trip to this
country in 25 years, held talks Monday with President Emile Lahoud
and said she delivered a message from U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   ``I transmitted to him the president's strong support for him
and for his new government (and) how impressed we were with his
Cabinet appointments,'' Shalala told reporters after the meeting
with Lahoud at the presidential palace in suburban Baabda.
	   ``For us, Lebanon has always had economic and strategic
importance,'' she said, adding that she will be reporting back to
Clinton on developments in the country of her ancestors.
	   Lahoud, the army commander, was unanimously elected by
Parliament in October after winning support from the public for his
promises to clean up corruption and the backing of Syrian President
Hafez Assad, who holds sway over Lebanese politics. Lahoud was
inaugurated Nov. 24.
	   Last week he appointed Salim Hoss, a U.S.-educated economist
widely respected for his integrity, as prime minister. The previous
premier, businessman Rafik Hariri who launched Lebanon's
multibillion dollar reconstruction program, quit unexpectedly in an
apparent power struggle with the assertive Lahoud.
	   Seeking to calm investors' fears, Hoss picked mostly new faces _
respected economists, businessmen and judges _ to serve in his
Cabinet. That effectively rid the government of most of the civil
war militia officials for the first time since the 1990 end of the
15-year conflict.
	   ``Everything that I heard and seen so far in Lebanon will lead
me to report to the (U.S.) president how much promise and
enthusiasm there is for this new government,'' Shalala said.
	   In her comments Sunday, Shalala said there has been ``much
improvement'' in security conditions in the country. She is on the
fourth day of a visit that has taken her to northern and eastern
Lebanon.
	   In the eastern Bekaa Valley, which had been off-limits to
Americans because of its reputation in the 1980s as stronghold of
anti-Western Islamic militants, Shalala attended Sunday Mass at a
Maronite Catholic church and toured the Roman ruins at Baalbek.
	   Shalala arrived in Lebanon on Friday aboard a U.S. military
helicopter that flew from the neighboring island of Cyprus to the
fortified U.S. Embassy compound outside Beirut. Beirut airport,
once known for its hijackings, remains off-limits to American
officials.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ High-voltage electricity killed a miner
in southern Bulgaria officials said Monday.
	   Feizi Shekirov, 31 was killed Sunday by 6,000 volts of
electricity at a generator unit in the Burieva mine near the town
of Madan, 300 kilometers (188 miles) southeast of Sofia.

Yeltsin fires key aides during a brief visit from hospital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kremlin reaction, new details throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Briefly returning to work with a bang, President
Boris Yeltsin fired most of his top aides on Monday during a quick
trip to the Kremlin and assumed personal control of two key
government agencies.
	   After just three hours at his office, Yeltsin returned to the
government hospital where he has been for the past two weeks. The
Kremlin shakeup removed several top aides who had publicly
questioned the president's health in recent weeks.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said the president would
remain in the hospital while he continued to be treated for
pneumonia. Asked when Yeltsin would be released, Yakushkin said it
would depend on the treatment and how long it took the president to
recover.
	   Yeltsin dismissed Chief of Staff Valentin Yumashev and his
deputies Yuri Yarov, Mikhail Komissar and Yevgeny Savostyanov.
	   Nikolai Bordyuzha, the secretary of the presidential security
council, was appointed the new chief of staff, while the other
posts remain vacant. Bordyuzha, who will serve in both posts, was
chief of the Border Guards before his appointment to the security
post earlier this year.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin had dismissed the aides because he was
not satisfied with their work. The president was particularly
unhappy over the Kremlin's handling of several recent incidents of
political extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist
deputy in the Russian parliament, he said.
	   ``That undermines confidence in the president, and in the
government as a whole and that is inadmissible in the current
difficult economic situation,'' the spokesman said.
	   Yeltsin has a habit of unexpected and often unexplained
dismissals. The latest round of dismissals was thought to reflect
Yeltsin's unhappiness over the aides' unusual candidness about his
health in recent weeks.
	   Yumashev and other Kremlin aides openly said that Yeltsin is too
weak to handle day-to-day affairs or to make foreign trips and
suggested he leave control of the economy and other current affairs
to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   The Russian media has said that the passive and defeatist aides
were further eroding Yeltsin's power. The dismissed aides handled
the workings of the Kremlin and the president's routine and had
considerable influence.
	   On Monday, Yeltsin said he will oversee the justice ministry and
tax police _ without replacing the actual heads. The move appeared
aimed at strengthening Yeltsin's authority at a time when there is
growing public unhappiness about endemic crime in Russian society.
	   A top democratic lawmaker, Galina Starovoitova, was murdered
last month in St. Petersburg in an apparent contract killing. Her
unexplained death outraged and shocked many Russian politicians and
ordinary people.
	   Yeltsin insists he has no serious health problems and that he
remains in control of the government.
	   Yeltsin had all but disappeared from sight when he entered a
government hospital Nov. 22 with pneumonia, the latest in a long
string of health problems in recent years for the Russian leader.
	   Many of Yeltsin's opponents claim he hasn't been seriously
involved in national affairs for a long time and is no longer fit
to lead.
	   Despite calls for his resignation, Yeltsin and his doctors
insist that the president will serve out his term, which ends in
2000.
	   Presidential aides said last week that doctors were having a
hard time persuading Yeltsin to rest and recover completely from
his illness. Primakov had appealed to Yeltsin to stay in hospital
and complete his recovery.

Samaranch backs China's decision to bid for 2008
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's doping scandals would not count
against its chances of becoming host for the 2008 Olympic Games,
International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch
said Monday.
	   Samaranch said the IOC took a positive view of China's moves to
fight doping.
	   ``I will say that maybe China is today one of the countries
fighting with all their strength against doping and that is quite
important to us,'' Samaranch said. ``We think the fight against
doping in China is a real example.''
	   China announced earlier this year, through world swimming
governing body FINA, that it would impose life bans on any athlete
testing positive for steroids.
	   China lost the bid to hold the 2000 Summer Games to Sydney,
Australia. It was considered a front-runner, with Samaranch then
defending the country's drug record.
	   Since that vote was taken, in 1993, China has been involved in
several doping scandals.
	   The worst came at the Asian Games in Hiroshima in 1994, when 11
athletes tested positive for steroids. Seven of those were
swimmers, and the tests came after the women's swim team sparked
drug rumors with its dominance at the Rome world championships.
	   Since then, the swimmers were below par and low key at the 1996
Olympics but were involved in further scandals in Perth, Australia,
earlier this year when six members were sent home in disgrace from
the world championships.
	   Samaranch was careful to avoid suggestions that he favored
Beijing's bid ahead of other candidates for 2008. The declared
candidates so far are Toronto, Canada, and Osaka, Japan. Bids are
expected from previous candidates Istanbul, Turkey; Seville, Spain;
and Buenos Aires, Argentina. Samaranch also mentioned Cairo, Egypt,
and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, as possible contenders.
	   A Chinese bid would have a major impact on the race for both the
2008 and 2012 Olympics.
	   China would be a major challenger to Toronto, considered the
2008 front-runner. That would be welcomed by the United States,
which is planning a bid for 2012. The United States would have
little chance of persuading the IOC to take the games to North
America twice running.
	   ``There is nothing in the rules about where the games must go,''
Samaranch said Monday.
	   ``As president of the IOC, if there are seven, eight or nine
candidates they all have the same value to me. Beijing bid for 2000
and I think that gave them good experience for how to bid again.
Maybe it was a good lesson.''
	   Human rights campaigners opposed the Beijing bid in 1993 but did
not sway many IOC members to vote against the Chinese. If China is
tackling the sports drugs problems, there seems little movement on
human rights there.
	   The government announced Sunday it had executed two white collar
criminals for smuggling computers, pagers and other electronic
goods into the country.
	   Olympic committees have until February 2000 to officially bid
for the 2008 Games. The decision will be made in 2001.

Norwegians hurt in car accident in Iraq off home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A Norwegian journalist hurt in a car
accident in Iraq last week left for home Monday on a flight that
also carried the body of his cameraman, who was killed in the
crash.
	   Anders Saether, a correspondent for Norway's TV2, left Amman
aboard a commercial flight to Bergen via Amsterdam, the Norwegian
Embassy said.
	   Saether, 30, left Iraq hours after the accident last Wednesday
and was admitted to an Amman hospital with whiplash, bruises and a
twisted ankle.
	   The body of his cameraman, Knut Andre Danielsen, arrived in
Jordan Sunday from Iraq. Danielsen, 33, was killed in last
Wednesday's accident in which a four-wheel drive taxi ran off a
desert highway and overturned five times.
	   Their Jordanian taxi driver was also hurt in the crash 350
kilometers (210 miles) east of the Iraqi capital Baghdad. The
desert highway is one of the few ways into Iraq because air travel
is banned to Iraq under U.N. sanctions.
	   The two Norwegians were sent to Iraq by TV2 to produce a feature
film on the plight of Iraqis under the sanctions, imposed following
the August 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
	   Danielsen's body was expected to be buried this week in his
hometown of Bergen.

Virenque says he will quit cycling over doping scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French cyclist Richard Virenque, maintaining he
never took banned drugs, says he will quit the sport because a
doping scandal is keeping him from finding a new team.
	   The former member of the disgraced Festina team, was quoted as
saying that it would be impossible to keep up his cycling career in
the light of the continuing scandal, French media reported Monday.
	   ``He (Virenque) has the impression that he is leaving a job
unfinished and he wants to apologize to his supporters. He would
like to keep making them dream, but it is not possible anymore,''
said the statement by Virenque, issued in the third person.
	   The statement issued late Sunday said that cycling teams were
not willing to hire Virenque because of the scandal.
	   The Festina team fell into disgrace when its masseur was
arrested driving a team car loaded with illegal drugs at the start
of last summer's Tour de France. Team officials later described
systematic drug use by the team to enhance performance.
	   However, Virenque has consistently denied being among those who
took drugs.
	   Virenque's wife told French radio Sunday that she still has hope
her husband will be asked to return to Festina or to join a new
cycling team.
	   ``If a team offered him a place right now he would go, because
cycling is his life's goal,'' Stephanie Virenque told France Info
radio.
	   Willy Voet, in an interview published last week in the daily
France-Soir, said Virenque and Herve regularly took EPO, or
erythropoietin, and other drugs.
	   Medical tests suggest cyclists on the Festina team took banned
drugs, judicial sources said last week citing a judge's report.
	   Three Festina officials have been put under formal
investigation, one step short of being formally charged: Voet; team
doctor Eric Ryckaert; and sporting director Bruno Roussel.

Kim proposes package deal to resolve North Korea's nuclear issue

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean President Kim Dae-jung on
Monday proposed a ``package deal,'' in which the United States
would provide economic and diplomatic benefits to North Korea in
exchange for access to a suspected nuclear weapons site, officials
said.
	   Kim made the proposal during a meeting with William Perry, the
newly appointed U.S. government policy coordinator on North Korea.
The former U.S. defense minister arrived Sunday on a three-nation
Asian tour, which includes stops in Tokyo and Beijing.
	   ``I think all problems related to North Korea should be tackled
in a package deal,'' chief presidential spokesman Park Ji-won
quoted Kim as telling Perry.
	   ``I hope for normalization of relations between the United
States and North Korea, and I think it's time to think about
lifting economic sanctions against North Korea,'' the spokesman
further quoted Kim as saying.
	   Perry reportedly promised to consider Kim's proposal.
	   The deal was apparently aimed at ending a stalemate involving
North Korea's refusal to accept a U.S. demand for inspections of
the suspected underground nuclear facility under construction at
Keumjang-ri, 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of the North's main
nuclear complex at Yongbyon.
	   Washington officials warn that North Korea's intransigent stance
could lead to a collapse of a 1994 nuclear accord, under which the
North's communist government promised to abandon its suspected
nuclear weapons program in return for aid.
	   U.S. spy satellite photographs taken earlier this year showed
thousands of North Korean workers burrowing into a mountainside at
the site, raising suspicion that the facility may be
nuclear-related.
	   While claiming that the facility is for civilian use, North
Korea has offered to allow a one-time inspection of the site, but
only if the United States pays it dlrs 300 million for having made
``false'' accusations.
	   Washington has spurned the offer.
	   In a rare statement issued last week, North Korea's military
denounced the U.S. demand as a ``declaration of war.''
	   On Monday, the North's Foreign Ministry said its diplomats have
little leeway to resolve the situation, because the dispute has
developed into military confrontation.
	   Kim told Perry on Monday that he believes North Korea is taking
a hard-line stand because it has become weak, the spokesman said.
	   The South Korean leader told Perry that even if the North's
suspicious facility was proven to be nuclear-related, that alone
should not trigger sanctions because it is still four or five years
away from completion, according to the spokesman.
	   ``The policy of engagement with North Korea should not be
abandoned. I believe it will succeed. North Korea will eventually
cooperate because they know they will lose if they start war,'' the
spokesman quoted Kim as saying.
	   Also Monday, Perry met with South Korean Foreign Minister Hong
Soon-young and Unification Minister Kang In-duk to discuss the
nuclear issue. They said Perry plans to return to Seoul after
traveling to Tokyo and Beijing.
	   South Korean officials worry that renewed tension on the
peninsula could hurt their economy, which has shown signs of
recovery after a year of deep recession, thanks in part to a dlrs
58 billion bailout by the International Monetary Fund.
	   Perry's visit comes as U.S. and North Korean officials are
negotiating terms of an outside inspection of the suspected weapons
site. A two-day meeting in New York last week appeared to have made
little progress toward that goal. But the negotiations were to
resume in Washington on Monday.
	   Before freezing its suspected nuclear weapons program under the
1994 accord, North Korea was believed to have extracted enough
plutonium to make one or two atomic bombs.

In Israel, less-than-enthusiastic welcome shaping up for Clinton
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 3 with parliament speaker saying he'll
boycott Clinton events to protest no Knesset visit. &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, reflecting
growing Israeli unease over U.S. President Bill Clinton's upcoming
visit, suggested Monday that the trip was entirely at the
initiative of the American leader.
	   ``What am I going to tell him, not to come _ don't come? I can
prevent him from coming?'' Netanyahu asked rhetorically in an
interview on army radio. ``We're not accustomed to refusing someone
who wants to come.''
	   In another sign of tensions arising from the trip, the speaker
of Israel's parliament, Dan Tichon, said he intended to boycott
Clinton-connected events to protest the fact that the president did
not plan to address the Knesset.
	   Clinton's visit to Israel, which begins Saturday, is to be
coupled with a stop in the Gaza Strip, the first by a sitting U.S.
president.
	   The United States has repeatedly said the trip is not intended
as an endorsement of Palestinian statehood aspirations, but the
Palestinians see it as a powerful boost to their sovereignty hopes.
	   On Monday, speaking to reporters in Gaza, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat hailed the upcoming trip as ``historical and great.''
	   The presidential visit to Israel and the Palestinian lands is
meant to encourage both sides to stick to the timetable set out in
the Wye River accords signed in October.
	   However, Netanyahu said Clinton's trip ``has value only if he
strengthens the Palestinian fulfillment of their obligations''
under the agreement.
	   In recent weeks, Israel and the Palestinians have accused one
another of failing to live up to various provisions, and Israel has
threatened to hold off on a scheduled Dec. 18 troop pullback.
	   Palestinians, for their part, are angry over stepped-up Jewish
settlement activity in the West Bank and Israel's failure to free
hundreds of so-called security prisoners, jailed for anti-Israel
activity.
	   Israel released the first 250 of a promised 750 Palestinian
prisoners last month, but they were mainly criminals, not security
prisoners as the Palestinians have demanded.
	   In response, Palestinians have been staging protests that have
repeatedly boiled over into violent street clashes. More
demonstrations were taking place Monday in several West Bank towns.
	   Also, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners were continuing a hunger
strike begun over the weekend.
	   The controversy over Clinton's visit also comes as Netanyahu is
trying to quell a potential parliamentary rebellion. Opposition
from within the coalition to Israel's ceding of West Bank land has
forced Netanyahu to seek new allies to prop up his government.
	   A vote on early elections was possible later Monday, but the
prime minister's opponents may not push the issue forward if they
lack the votes.
	   Netanyahu has been sparring publicly with his former foreign
minister, David Levy, who considered rejoining the shaky governing
coalition in exchange for the finance minister's job.
	   The prime minister said the two couldn't agree on economic
principles and that he wouldn't sacrifice Israel's economy to
coalition politics.
	   The Clinton visit has added to already-simmering tensions within
the government. At Sunday's Israeli Cabinet meeting, a shouting
match broke out over it, according to Israel radio.
	   ``Who invited President Clinton to the Gaza Strip?'' Silvan
Shalom, the science minister, reportedly yelled at Netanyahu.
Netanyahu said it had been Clinton's idea, not his.
	   In Gaza, Clinton is to be on hand for a meeting at which
Palestinians will reaffirm the nullifaction of clauses in their
national charter calling for Israel's destruction.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) - Three members of an international ring
trying to market dlrs 5 million in counterfeit U.S. dollars were
arrested while a fourth believed to be an American managed to
escape, police said Monday.
	   The three arrested were identified as Abdulnasser Lutfi Hanafi,
28, a Sudanese; Charles Odiri, 26, a Nigerian; and Ibrahim Ali
Khaled, 33, a Lebanese.
	   They were arrested Sunday in the resort of Maameltein, 25 miles
(15 miles) north of Beirut, after a car chase in which shots were
fired in the air and two policemen were slightly injured, a police
official said, speaking under customary condition of anonymity.
	   The fourth man escaped. An American passport found in his hotel
room had the name Tony Scott, 36, of Chicago, police said. They
said dlrs 5 million in expertly printed, forged U.S. 100 dollar
bills were found in the room.
	   The English-language newspaper The Daily Star said
anti-counterfeit officers from the U.S. Embassy in Nicosia, Cyprus,
were flying in Monday to help in the investigation.

Kosovo Albanian negotiator: U.S. plan totally unacceptable
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. peace efforts in Kosovo
suffered a setback on Monday, with the chief ethnic Albanian
negotiator reportedly rejecting a draft for the future of the
majority ethnic Albanian province of Serbia.
	   Fehmi Agani, head of the Kosovo Albanian negotiating team, said
the latest version of the American peace plan was ``totally
unacceptable,'' Glas, a Belgrade-based daily, reported.
	   Agani did not elaborate why the plan, presented by American
envoy Christopher Hill, was unacceptable for his side. Ethnic
Albanian negotiators were expected to come up with an official
reaction later Monday.
	   Details of the newest version of the plan have not been made
public. The American diplomat has been trying to hammer out a peace
formula acceptable to both independence-minded ethnic Albanians and
the Serb government, which wants to keep control over the province.
	   But Hill's efforts so far have been fruitless with the two sides
unable to agree on a compromise formula. Although a de-facto cease
fire generated by an agreement to end a government crackdown in
Kosovo has reduced bloodshed, there are fears that Kosovo will
again explode in fierce fighting unless a political solution is
found by spring.
	   Clashes earlier this year pitting an alliance of Yugoslav army
and Serb police forces against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army claimed hundreds of lives and made more than a
quarter of a million people homeless. Serbia is the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   A previous version of the U.S. draft was rejected by Serbia
because it gave the republic almost no control over Kosovo. But
that formula was cautiously greeted by ethnic Albanian negotiators
and the guerrillas gave a mixed response, with one faction not
ruling it out as an interim solution, and the other rejecting it.
	   ``We had some objections to the previous version too, but this
one is totally unacceptable,'' Agani told Glas. ``It is obvious
that Hill offers one solution after talking to us and another after
talking to (Serbian president Milan) Milutinovic.''
	   It was not clear what changes were made to the previous draft,
but Agani's criticism suggested the reworked version gave Serbia
more authority in Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who make up more than 90 percent of Kosovo's
population, overwhelmingly seek independence from Serbia.

ASEAN police chiefs gather in Singapore to tackle cross-border
</HEADLINE>
crime

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Southeast Asian police chiefs predicted Monday
that drug trafficking, piracy of copyrighted materials and computer
fraud will probably be the biggest regional cross-border crimes in
the next century, Singapore's state-run television reported.
	   The police representatives have gathered in Singapore for a
two-week conference to strengthen ties within the regional grouping
and discuss collective strategies to deal with cross-border crimes.
	   Senior police officers from the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations recommended the creation of a joint framework linking their
respective operations to combat rising trans-boundary crime, the
report said.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.
	   In Singapore, authorities have arrested 15 drug smugglers at
various border checkpoints during the first nine months of 1998,
more than double last year's figures, said the report.

Most seats for St. Petersburg elections go to runoffs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING
 &UR; By DMITRY LOVETSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Most local legislative seats up for
grabs in Russia's second largest city of St. Petersburg will go to
runoffs after an election that was marred by bomb threats and
complaints of voter fraud.
	   Officials said Monday that just six of 50 seats were decided in
Sunday's election for the St. Petersburg legislative assembly,
while the rest will go to runoffs scheduled for December 20.
	   The six seats were all held by incumbent assembly deputies.
Candidates must get more than 50 percent of the vote to win in the
first round or the top two vote winners face each other in a second
round.
	   Liberals took a prominent lead in the first round of voting,
with 22 members of the liberal Yabloko party and nine people from
various other reform-minded parties still in the race.
	   Ten communists, as well as the city's former police chief, a
movie actress and the author of a tell-all book about the former
mayor of St. Petersburg are also still in the running.
	   Observers were eager to see how the elections would reflect
public reaction to rising crime in St. Petersburg, as well as the
Nov. 20 killing of Galina Starovoitova, a member of the Russian
parliament who supported a liberal bloc of candidates in the
elections.
	   Starovoitova supporters speculated she was killed so that her
faction, Northern Capital, would fare poorly in the election. Her
death, however, may have had the opposite effect, rallying liberal
voters.
	   In addition, hitmen have killed a legislative aide, a
high-ranking city official and a prominent banker in the last two
months.
	   Dirty politics in St. Petersburg were reflected in the
elections, which were marred by violence, racial slurs against
Jewish candidates and complaints of ballot box stuffing.
	   The City Electoral Commission also reported complaints of voter
bribery, and bomb threats forced the temporary closure of three
stations.
	   Still, voter turnout was high by Russian standards _ around 40
percent.

ScottishPower announces merger with Pacificorp
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ScottishPower cq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ ScottishPower PLC on Monday announced an agreed
4.7 billion pound (dlrs 7.8 billion) merger - widely seen as a
takeover _ of the U.S. electricity utility Pacificorp.
	   The new group, which will reportedly be the world's largest
multi-utility group, will be based in Glasgow and will retain the
SocttishPower name and its primary listing in London, the company
said.
	   Its U.S. head office will be in Portland, Oregon.
	   If approved, the deal would be the first time a foreign company
as acquired a U.S. utility.
	   The merger is expected to close late next year.
	   Under the terms of the deal, each Pacificorp share will be
exchanged for 0.58 American Depository Receipts or 2.32 ordinary
shares of ScottishPower.
	   ScottishPower chairman Murray Stuart will become chairman of the
new group. Alan Richardson, power systems managing director at the
Scottish utility, will become chief executive officer of
Pacificorp.
	   The value of the new company, the British Broadcasting Corp.
said, will be 12 billion pounds (dlrs 19.9 billion).
	   Pacificorp shareholders will own around 36 percent of the new
company, and ScottishPower shareholders 64 percent.
	   In a statement, ScottishPower said that _ before writing off the
value of goodwill over a period _ the takeover was expected to
improve share earnings from the first full year after the deal
closed.
	   ``ScottishPower believes that it will create significant value
for shareholders by transferring to Pacificorp its proven skills in
improving customer service and delivering cost efficiencies,'' the
statement said.
	   However, ScottishPower shares dropped in early trading falling
29 pence (48 cents), or 4.3 percent, to 646 pence (1072 cents).
	   ScottishPower supplies gas, water, electricity and phone
services to 5 million British homes.
	   Pacificorp Chairman Keith McKennon said the deal will help the
company concentrate more effectively on its core electricity
business.
	   London stockbroker Williams De Broe downgraded ScottishPower to
``hold'' from ``buy'' on news of the merger.
	   Utilities analyst Nigel Hawkins expressed concern about
PacifiCorp's finances.
	   ``PacifiCorp's underlying earnings per share have been falling
over the last 18 months and the market may need some reassurance
over this,'' said Hawkins.
	   ScottishPower has tried twice before to make a deal with an
American company. Its previous attempts _ with Florida Light and
Power, and then Cinergy, foundered on disagreements about
management.

Fifteen people die in traffic accidents as roads ice over
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Fifteen people died over the weekend
in car accidents after freezing rain turned roads around the
country into sheets of ice, a police official said Monday.
	   Hundreds of cars were damaged and 88 other victims were
seriously injured, said Col. Ioan Palalau of the Romanian traffic
police. The normal average weekend traffic death toll is two or
three people.
	   Freezing rain began Friday and the government ordered all five
major highways out of the capital temporarily closed. Temperatures
Monday hovered around -6 C (21 F) in Bucharest.
	   Bucharest's emergency hospital reported treating more than 150
fractures the last 48 hours caused by people falling on icy
sidewalks and roads.
	   Roads all over the country remained blanketed by ice, despite
efforts by authorities to melt it with salt and sand.
	   ``It's hard to fight it. What we melt during the day freezes
over at night,'' Palalau said.
	   Private television stations showed dozens of cars skidding on
treacherous roads and policemen sliding and falling as they
directed traffic.
	   It was coldest in the northeast Moldova region, where
temperatures dropped to -15C (5F).

Portugal: China has no plans for early movement of troops into
</HEADLINE>
Macau

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China is not considering moving soldiers into
Macau before Portuguese colonial rule ends in just over a year,
Portugal's ambassador to Beijing said Monday.
	   China plans to garrison troops in Macau after the Dec. 20, 1999,
handover to mark the ``symbolic presence'' of Beijing's sovereignty
after 500 years of Portuguese rule, Ambassador Pedro Catarino said.
	   Unlike Britain's return last year of Hong Kong, China has not
asked to bring troops in before ``zero hour,'' Catarino told the
Foreign Correspondents Club of China.
	   Also unlike Hong Kong _ the large, bustling financial center
across the Pearl River Delta from Macau _ preparations for the
Portuguese colony's transfer have been relatively smooth so far,
the ambassador said.
	   Disputes over greater democracy in Hong Kong marred negotiations
between Beijing and London in the final years before the July 1,
1997, handover.
	   The debate and Beijing's decision to station People's Liberation
Army troops in the territory also created unease among many Hong
Kong residents.
	   Still, Catarino said a number of issues still have to be
resolved in the 377 days before Portugal hands Macau and its
450,000 residents over to Beijing.
	   Chief among its concerns is maintaining the rule of law in
Macau. Finding qualified local residents to fill the judiciary will
be difficult, and Beijing and Lisbon have not settled on a court of
final appeal for the territory, the ambassador said.
	   Asia's financial turmoil _ which started soon after the Chinese
flag was raised over Hong Kong _ has made Beijing anxious about
Macau's financial assets, Catarino said.
	   He said Macau is turning over a land fund worth 8 billion Hong
Kong dollars (over dlrs 1 billion) and adding 2.8 billion Hong Kong
dollars (dlrs 360 million), a previous budget surplus, for next
year's budget.
	   China's legislature also has not approved a citizenship law
covering the 10,000 Macau residents of Portuguese or mixed
ancestry, he added.
	   Ultimately, Portugal worries that Macau's distinctive culture
will be overwhelmed by massive, overpopulated China, especially if
Beijing promotes a nationalistic Chinese identity like it did in
Hong Kong, the ambassador said.
	   ``It is essential through day-to-day practices and
decision-making that the uniqueness of Macau will be preserved so
that the territory will not become unrecognizable in the web of the
Pearl River Delta,'' said Catarino.

Van Exel wants to play in Europe, will sue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The weekend passed with hardly anyone noticing
that David Stern managed to keep Latrell Sprewell out of the NBA
for one year, after all.
	   Now, Nick Van Exel is suing to get out.
	   Van Exel, who wants to play in Europe and stay there even if the
lockout ends, plans to file suit against the NBA, USA Basketball
and FIBA later this week, his agent said.
	   Van Exel and several other plaintiffs, including Marcus Camby of
the New York Knicks, allege that the NBA and USA Basketball will
not give clearance to FIBA, the sport's world governing body, for a
player to continue playing under a European League contract if his
NBA team wants him back after the lockout.
	   Van Exel, traded in June from the Los Angeles Lakers to the
Denver Nuggets, has one year left on his NBA contract for about
dlrs 2.1 million, which means he has lost about dlrs 700,000 in
salary. Agent James Bryant has received offers from two or three
teams overseas, and said Van Exel would make about dlrs 2 million
and then return as a free agent for the 1999-2000 NBA season.
	   ``Nick wants to work this year,'' said Bryant, who has not yet
decided where the lawsuit will be filed. He said Cincinnati, where
the contract was signed, was a possibility.
	   Monday will be the fourth day since the last collective
bargaining session was held, and neither side has shown an urgency
to schedule another one.
	   The season, if there ever is one, cannot begin until mid-January
at the earliest.
	   More than 100 players took part in a conference call Sunday to
discuss the state of negotiations. A union spokesman said the call
lasted about an hour and 15 minutes and several players expressed
their willingness to sit out the entire season rather than accept
an unfavorable labor agreement.
	   Monday, a news conference will be held in Manhattan to announce
an exhibition game to be held Dec. 19 in Atlantic City, televised
on cable by Showtime, featuring members of all four Dream Teams _
the 1992 and 1996 Olympic teams and the 1994 and 1998 World
Championship teams.
	   Van Exel's lawsuit comes after FIBA voted Dec. 2 to repeal the
rule limiting European League teams to two foreigners per roster.
The change will take effect next season.
	   Stern testified last summer at the guaranteed contracts
arbitration hearing before arbitrator John Feerick that all NBA
players are technically free agents during the lockout, but all
contracts would go back into effect once the lockout ended. More
than 220 players are signed for the 1998-99 season and another 200
are free agents.
	   NBA chief legal officer Jeffrey Mishkin declined comment on Van
Exel's suit, but said the league had no objection to players going
overseas as long as they return if the lockout ends.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Three members of an international ring
trying to market dlrs 5 million in counterfeit U.S. dollars were
arrested while a fourth believed to be an American managed to
escape, police said Monday.
	   The three arrested were identified as Abdulnasser Lutfi Hanafi,
28, a Sudanese; Charles Odiri, 26, a Nigerian; and Ibrahim Ali
Khaled, 33, a Lebanese.
	   They were arrested Sunday in the resort of Maameltein, 25 miles
(15 miles) north of Beirut, after a car chase in which shots were
fired in the air and two policemen were slightly injured, a police
official said, speaking under customary condition of anonymity.
	   The fourth man escaped. An American passport found in his hotel
room had the name Tony Scott, 36, of Chicago, police said. They
said dlrs 5 million in expertly printed, forged U.S. 100 dollar
bills were found in the room.
	   The English-language newspaper The Daily Star said
anti-counterfeit officers from the U.S. Embassy in Nicosia, Cyprus,
were flying in Monday to help in the investigation.

Ukrainian authorities cut off Russian fleet's telephones
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEVASTOPOL, Ukraine (AP) _ A Ukrainian telephone company shut
off lines to Russia's Black Sea fleet in the Crimean port of
Sevastopol because the fleet hasn't paid its bills, fleet officials
said Monday.
	   According to the state-owned Ukrtelecom company, the fleet owed
more than 500,000 hryvna (dlrs 146,000) in unpaid bills as of Nov.
30.
	   The company shut down lines to the fleet commander's deputies,
top aides and senior staff officers, the independent UNIAN news
agency reported.
	   Russia can no longer fully finance the fleet, which has become
the city's largest single debtor. It owes about 10.6 million hryvna
(dlrs 3 million) for electricity, water and heat, city authorities
say.
	   Russia rents naval bases in Sevastopol in Ukraine, a mostly
ethnic Russian city on the Crimean Peninsula, under a 1996 deal on
dividing the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet. The status of
Sevastopol _ which Russian nationalists argue should belong to
Russia _ has spoiled relations between the two countries since the
1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The cash-poor city government has already cut off electricity
and heat to some of the fleet's bases, prompting angry appeals from
fleet commander Vladimir Komoedov.
	   Komoedov has warned that the city's measures might lead to new
tension, but city authorities insist that no politics are involved.
	   Fleet officials, however, point out that the Sevastopol populace
and enterprises owe some 4.4 million hryvna (dlrs 1.28 million) in
unpaid telephone bills alone.

surge

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed higher Monday,
with key indexes in Hong Kong and Seoul surging nearly 5 percent.
	   Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 465.68 points, or 4.7
percent, to close at 10,428.82 on the back of unexpected rate cuts
in both Hong Kong and China and a sharp rebound on Wall Street on
Friday.
	   Leading Hong Kong banks have cut their prime lending rate, the
rate reserved for their most creditworthy customers, to 9.25
percent from 9.50 percent.
	   Mainland China also reduced interest rates by 0.5 percent on
average effective Monday, lifting China-related shares on the Hong
Kong stock exchange.
	   ``The rate cut in Hong Kong and China, and the sharp rise on
Wall Street are all good news for the local market,'' said Peter
Lai, a director at OCBC Securities (HK) Ltd.
	   On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 135.46 points
to 9,016.14.
	   Share prices on the Seoul Stock Exchange also surged on expected
plans by the heads of the nation's top five conglomerates to
sharply pare the number of affiliates that each controls.
	   After the market closed, the Samsung, Hyundai, Daewoo, LG and SK
groups said they would spin off at least 130 of their 264
subsidiaries in a move to raise some 20 trillion won (dlrs 16.6
billion).
	   The main Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 23.81 points, or
4.9 percent, to 514.52.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 83.52
points, or 0.57 percent, to close the day at 14,723.49. On Friday,
the average closed down 57.11 points, or 0.39 percent.
	   Share prices were buoyed by Friday's gain on Wall Street, but
trading was light as investors continued to monitor developments
concerning Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party's efforts to
solidify a coalition with the opposition Liberal Party.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar was quoted at 118.96 yen in late afternoon
trading, up 0.64 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its
late New York level of 118.95 yen on Friday.
	   Bucking the trend was the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, where
prices were dragged down by profit-taking and concern over the
abuse of power trial of former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   The Malaysian bourse's key Composite Index fell 12.48 points, or
2.4 percent, to 514.78.
	   The Thai market was closed for a holiday.
	   Most other Asian markets closed higher.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices rose sharply as investors responded
positively to the sweeping victory by the ruling Nationalist Party
in weekend elections. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index

Kosovo Albanian negotiator: U.S. plan totally unacceptable
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. peace efforts in Kosovo
suffered a setback on Monday, with the chief ethnic Albanian
negotiator reportedly rejecting a draft for the future of the
majority ethnic Albanian province of Serbia.
	   Fehmi Agani, head of the Kosovo Albanian negotiating team, said
the latest version of the American peace plan was ``totally
unacceptable,'' Glas, a Belgrade-based daily, reported.
	   Agani did not elaborate why the plan, presented by American
envoy Christopher Hill, was unacceptable for his side. Ethnic
Albanian negotiators were expected to come up with an official
reaction later Monday.
	   Details of the newest version of the plan have not been made
public. The American diplomat has been trying to hammer out a peace
formula acceptable to both independence-minded ethnic Albanians and
the Serb government, which wants to keep control over the province.
	   But Hill's efforts so far have been fruitless with the two sides
unable to agree on a compromise formula. Although a de-facto cease
fire generated by an agreement to end a government crackdown in
Kosovo has reduced bloodshed, there are fears that Kosovo will
again explode in fierce fighting unless a political solution is
found by spring.
	   Clashes earlier this year pitting an alliance of Yugoslav army
and Serb police forces against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army claimed hundreds of lives and made more than a
quarter of a million people homeless. Serbia is the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   A previous version of the U.S. draft was rejected by Serbia
because it gave the republic almost no control over Kosovo. But
that formula was cautiously greeted by ethnic Albanian negotiators
and the guerrillas gave a mixed response, with one faction not
ruling it out as an interim solution, and the other rejecting it.
	   ``We had some objections to the previous version too, but this
one is totally unacceptable,'' Agani told Glas. ``It is obvious
that Hill offers one solution after talking to us and another after
talking to (Serbian president Milan) Milutinovic.''
	   It was not clear what changes were made to the previous draft,
but Agani's criticism suggested the reworked version gave Serbia
more authority in Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who make up more than 90 percent of Kosovo's
population, overwhelmingly seek independence from Serbia.

Government forces kill 60 rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Government forces killed
60 rebel militia men in a clash in the southern rebel stronghold of
Ntadi, a government statement said Monday.
	   At least three government soldiers were also killed during the
Saturday fight which occurred after the rebels tried to ambush the
troops, the statement said.
	   Troops have since been deployed to the region to beef up
security, the state news agency reported Monday.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed and conflicting
reports of the incident spoke of much higher casualties on the
government side.
	   Ntadi, about 175 km (100 miles) from Brazzaville is close to
Mindouli where the same rebels, known as the ``Ninjas,'' gunned
down 45 worshipers about two weeks ago.
	   The killings are the latest in a growing number of attacks on
civilian and government targets in the southern Republic of Congo.
	   Dozens of officials have been killed over the past few months,
news reports say.
	   The Ninjas have links to former Prime Minister Bernard Kolelas,
a sometime-ally of ousted president Pascal Lissouba.
	   Both fled the country after Lissouba was defeated by President
Denis Sassou Nguesso in a five month civil war last year, but the
Ninjas have resisted disarmament and are waging a campaign against
Sassou-Nguesso's government.
	   Since his take over, Sassou-Nguesso has outlawed all militia
groups including his own Cobras.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, reflecting
growing Israeli unease over U.S. President Bill Clinton's upcoming
visit, suggested Monday that the trip was entirely at the
initiative of the American leader.
	   ``What am I going to tell him, not to come _ don't come? I can
prevent him from coming?'' Netanyahu asked rhetorically in an
interview on army radio. ``We're not accustomed to refusing someone
who wants to come.''
	   In another sign of tensions arising from the trip, the speaker
of Israel's parliament, Dan Tichon, said he intended to boycott
Clinton-connected events to protest the fact that the president did
not plan to address the Knesset.

Japan considers how to deal with Greenpeace interference in
</HEADLINE>
whaling &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) _ Four Greenpeace activists chained
themselves to two Japanese whaling ships Monday to prevent their
departure from port in New Caledonia.
	   Two protesters chained themselves to the harpoon and anchor of
the catcher vessel Kyo Maru while two others attached themselves to
the factory vessel Nisshin Maru.
	   Defending its actions, Greenpeace said that the Japanese
scientific whaling program was a sham and an insult to science.
	   The Nisshin Maru, the mother ship, was undergoing repairs at
Noumea for engine trouble suffered when the ship caught fire last
month.
	   The fleet was due to return to Japan on Monday for further
repairs before resuming whaling in Antarctic waters in early 1999.
	   Greenpeace said the protesters would remain chained to the
vessels until there was a clear message from Japan that they would
not go whaling this season.
	   The environmental organization said Japan had consistently
ignored the internationally recognized Southern Ocean Whale
Sanctuary declared in 1994 by the International Whaling Commission.
	   The environmental group also described Japan's whaling campaign
as ``commercial whaling draped in the cloak of science.''
	   The Japanese whaling ships, which left Japan on Nov. 6, hope to
catch 440 minke whales this hunting season around Antarctica, the
same number caught last year.

Environmental group dumps asphalt to protest planned fifth runway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAARLEM, Netherlands (AP) _ Environmental activists dumped a can
of asphalt in the garden of the Dutch transportation minister's
home Monday to protest plans to expand Amsterdam's Schiphol
Airport.
	   Activists with the group Green Front staged the action in front
of Transport Minister Tineke Netelenbos' house in this western
city, saying the blacktop was symbolic of plans to build a fifth
runway.
	   Environmental groups fiercely oppose plans to enlarge Schiphol,
already one of Europe's busiest airports, contending any expansion
would only worsen noise pollution from low-flying jets.
	   The Dutch government, which owns 76 percent of the airport, is
expected to outline its view of Schiphol's future by the end of the
year.
	   In addition to plans for a fifth runway to handle growing
traffic, the airport and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines want to build a
satellite airport on a manmade island in the North Sea off the
Dutch coast.

Gunman surrenders after nine-hour hostage drama
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with police confirming surrender, no harm
to hostage. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HASTINGS, New Zealand (AP) _ A gunman who held police SWAT team
members at bay for more than nine hours surrendered Monday after
taking a woman hostage in the downtown office of the local member
of Parliament.
	   The man, only identified as a 50-year-old welfare beneficiary
who has pestered local legislators over a legal grievance, walked
from the building with his arms extended in front of him to be met
by a ring of armed police.
	   ``Everything's back under control, the offender has given
himself up and is in custody,'' Senior Sgt. Mike Wilkinson told The
Associated Press.
	   Electorate secretary Jan Woodhall, held hostage at the point of
a shotgun throughout the day, came out of the building about 10
minutes later with a policewoman and was driven away.
	   The gunman's surrender came after several hours of telephone
talks with police negotiators. Earlier the man tried to telephone
prominent people including Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and Labor
opposition leader Helen Clark. Neither took the calls.
	   Member of Parliament Rick Barker was not at his office in
Hastings at the time the drama began mid-morning.
	   Police evacuated people working in surrounding buildings, and
half a dozen blocks were cordoned off in the rural town on the east
coast of New Zealand's north island.
	   Barker has a court order preventing the armed man, who is known
to him as a frequent letter writer with a number of grievances,
from pestering him.
	   Independent legislator Neil Kirton said all the members of
Parliament in the region had been severely harassed by the man.
	   He said the man's harassment related occasionally to his court
conviction
	   for benefit fraud.
	   ``But it went much broader than that. He saw a great conspiracy
under every government and arm of state. The language he uses is
just appalling. He wades in to everyone with the most vile of
comments,'' Kirton said.
	   Hastings is about 160 miles (260 km) northeast of Wellington,
the capital, and 220 miles (355 km) southeast of Auckland.
	   The incident is believed to be the first armed one involving a
member of Parliament since 1996, when a woman was arrested with an
air pistol at Parliament trying to get to the office of former
Prime Minister David Lange.
	   The Asian woman claimed to be an illegitimate daughter of
Britain's Queen Elizabeth II.
	   The gas-operated air pistol was found in her bag after she was
stopped by security staff while trying to get a pass into
Parliament House.

Samaranch praises Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ International Olympic Committee
president Juan Antonio Samaranch gave Bangkok a glowing report
Monday for its work as host of the Asian Games.
	   That's not surprising, considering Samaranch wanders the globe
bestowing compliments on Olympic committees like a proud father.
	   Samaranch, who called the organizational nightmare of Atlanta
1996 a ``most exceptional'' Olympics, had high praise for the
regional games, which are in their 13th edition here.
	   ``I watched the opening ceremony last night and I was really
surprised. Surprised because the opening ceremony was really one of
the best I have seen in my life,'' said Samaranch, who has seen
plenty. ``It was full of art and good taste and I'm very pleased to
honor today the organizing committee of the games, the Thai Olympic
Committee and the Olympic Council of Asia.''
	   Samaranch took a tour around the athletes' village and venues
Monday after spending the night at a colorful and entertaining
opening ceremony.
	   Throughout Bangkok there are signs of an economic crisis that
has curbed construction and squeezed the budget for these games.
	   Pillars stand in line, waiting for the highway to be placed on
top. The tennis court has hard concrete instead of seats, and the
direct journey from main press center to center court is through
scrubland.
	   As in Atlanta, the results system is poor, but in an improvement
the bus drivers seem to know where they are going. In many ways it
is the patchwork games, especially compared to the excellent
performance of Kuala Lumpur, host to the recent Commonwealth Games
in a similar economic climate.
	   The current Asian Games have some 6,000 athletes from 41 nations
competing for 377 gold medals in 36 sports.
	   ``At this moment, the Asian Games, maybe, I will say maybe, is
the most important sports competition after the Olympic Games,''
Samaranch said.

China set to put democracy campaigner on trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 10 grafs to UPDATE with details of indictment,
court officials comment; picks up 8th graf pvs `Cases of ... '
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Speeding up a campaign to stamp out a would-be
political opposition party, Chinese authorities will put one of its
leading organizers on trial next week for subversion, a rights
group reported Monday.
	   Court officials in Hangzhou city gave Wang Youcai's wife an
indictment Monday identifying him as a ringleader of the China
Democracy Party and outlining five charges he will face at trial
Dec. 17, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China reported.
	   The principle charge accuses Wang of linking up with overseas
forces to ``incite the overthrow of state power'' and is punishable
by 10 years to life in prison, the Hong Kong-based Information
Center said.
	   Detained a month ago, Wang was only formally arrested on Nov.
30, part of a concerted effort to silence the leadership of the
opposition party.
	   That same day, two other prominent dissidents and party
organizers, Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin, were taken into custody. Like
Wang, they have been accused of crimes under China's vague state
security law. China's Communist Party leaders have repeatedly used
the law, revised last year, to punish high-profile dissidents.
	   Authorities appear to be moving with haste against the three
dissidents. To arrest and try Wang in what would be 18 days is
unusual, especially in such a politically sensitive case. The
Information Center said the speed was proof that Chinese leaders
have already decided to convict Wang.
	   Wang's wife, Hu Jiangxia, hurriedly hired a lawyer, and they
were to meet with Wang on Monday, the Information Center said.
	   The indictment charged Wang with calling for the overthrow of
the Communist Party by writing in the China Democracy Party
manifesto that opposition politics was the only way ``to eliminate
tyranny,'' the Information Center said.
	   The indictment also accused Wang of organizing a July 10 meeting
of party supporters, using computer e-mail to send party literature
abroad and accepting dlrs 800, mostly in Chinese currency, from
overseas to buy a computer, the group said.
	   Administrators at the Hangzhou No. 1 Intermediate People's Court
said they knew nothing about the charges against Wang or the trial
date.
	   Cases of subversion are usually tried behind closed doors.
	   Wang Youcai rose to prominence as a student leader of the
democracy demonstrations based in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in
1989. Put on the 21 most-wanted fugitives list by the government in
its crackdown, Wang served two years in prison.
	   He boldly announced the formation of the China Democracy Party
on June 25, the day President Bill Clinton arrived in China for the
first visit by a U.S. president in nine years.
	   Police waited until Clinton's departure before moving against
Wang. Of the 12 party organizers detained in the first wave of
arrests, Wang spent the longest in custody, over seven weeks. He
was taken away again two months later, on Nov. 2. Police never
notified his wife where he was being held and why.
	   Fellow party organizers, Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin, started their
open dissent in the seminal Democracy Wall movement of the late
1970s.
	   Xu spent 12 years in prison, much of it in solitary confinement,
and when his parole ended late last year he took up a role as an
adviser and coordinator for many democracy campaigners. Xu said
last month he only became directly involved in efforts to set up
the China Democracy Party when another prominent dissident dropped
out.
	   A member of Xu's circle, He Depu, said Monday he was beaten over
the weekend for campaigning for a seat in one of Beijing's district
legislatures.
	   It was the second time he claimed he was beaten campaigning at
the Beijing Information Engineering College, part of his
constituency. Local election officials have told He his campaign is
illegal, but he said they have refused requests to inform him in
writing.

Relatives of kidnapped Serbs to organize ``march of peace''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Relatives of 40 Serbs missing from a
town in southwestern Kosovo announced they would organize a ``march
of peace'' toward a stronghold of ethnic Albanian rebels they hold
responsible.
	   At a news conference in the Kosovo capital of Pristina, Serbs
from Orahovac whose relatives disappeared earlier this year
appealed for international help in finding their loved ones.
	   ``We will go barehanded to Dragobilje because we believe our
kidnapped are there,'' said Ranko Djinovic, whose brother had
disappeared. He was referring to a Kosovo Liberation Army
stronghold northeast of Orahovac.
	   About 200 Serbs have disappeared in Kosovo and are believed to
have been abducted by the rebels. The rebels have released some of
their hostages following mediation by international officials.
	   The Serb march from Orahovac to Dragobilje will be held on
Dec.10, starting at noon. Djinovic called on all institutions in
Kosovo to halt their work in support of the march.

Despite internal discord over details, EU remains upbeat on

expansion &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The EU foreign ministers sought to keep
the European Union's expansion drive alive Monday by trying to
sound welcoming to newcomers yet without committing to any specific
entry dates.
	   Hampering the EU is a disagreement on how to fund a
near-doubling of the ranks and how fast to expand the union, issues
that will dominate a two-day summit opening Friday in Vienna.
	   Even so, the foreign ministers planned to send the EU leaders an
upbeat report declaring efforts to bring Cyprus and 10 East
European nations and, possibly, Malta into the EU in the next
decade are well on track.
	   Negotiations opened this fall with Cyprus, Hungary, Poland, the
Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia and preliminary talks with
slower-track candidates Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and
Bulgaria.
	   The EU refuses to set firm entry dates to ensure candidates keep
up their reform efforts to get in shape for EU membership.
	   The first newcomers won't likely join until 2004 or 2005.
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are generally expected to
get in first.
	   The Netherlands, Germany, France and Italy have second thoughts
about admitting a divided Cyprus.
	   Germany and France oppose accelerating talks with Lithuania,
Latvia and Slovakia _ slow-trackers which the EU head office says
do better than expected to get ready for membership.
	   Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden and France insist that
ahead of enlargement, the EU must get a grip on spending.
	   These countries want the EU budget to rise until 2006 only in
line with inflation from this year's level of 85 billion European
currency units (dlrs 100 billion).
	   But Spain and other southerners want the EU to continue to be
generous with special aid for them. They fear losing money to
finance the entry of Cyprus and other candidates and want
membership fees raised.
	   The European Commission has proposed to link EU spending to
economic growth which would add some 20 billion ecu (dlrs 23.6
billion) to the budget by 2006.
	   But Germany and others say they already pay far more into the EU
than they get back and want to limit their net contributions.
Germany's net payment is some 22 billion marks (dlrs 13 billion) a
year.
	   Complicating the money debate is Britain's refusal to give up an
annual rebate which it has been getting since 1984.
	   Worth 2.6 billion pounds (dlrs 4 billion) this year, that rebate
was granted to offset London's net payment but its EU partners want
it to go arguing Britain is much better off now than 14 years ago.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook sounded defiant, saying,
``It is not going to change ... We are going to keep it.''
	   Germany, which assumes the EU presidency Jan. 1, wants to clinch
a budget reform deal by March.
	   Key to that is a major overhaul of EU agricultural spending.
Subsidies for EU farmers still eat up half of the budget. The
European Commission has proposed cuts of up to 30 percent in
subsidies, which just about every government opposes.

Ex-attorney general attacks FBI agent's evidence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo GEV101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark,
testifying in defense of a reputed Russian mafia godfather, said
Monday that the Geneva court should ignore evidence submitted last
week by a retired FBI agent.
	   ``The statements of the former FBI agent which deal with matters
and facts alleged to have occurred in the Russian Federation in my
opinion have no evidentiary value whatsoever,'' Clark said.
	   Appearing as a defense witness for Sergei Mikhailov, Clark told
the Geneva correctional court that the testimony of Robert Levinson
last Thursday would never have been allowed in an American court.
	   ``There is nothing to support any basis for knowledge on the
part of Mr. Levinson as to the matters about which he testified. He
has never said that he went to Russia and personally witnessed
anything.''
	   Mikhailov is charged with being a member in a criminal
organization. Swiss prosecutors allege he is head of the
Solntsevskaya organization based in Moscow.
	   Levinson said that as a special agent of the U.S. Federal Bureau
of Investigation he spent four years looking into the activities of
the Russian mafia and worked on the case against Vyacheslav
Ivankov, whom a New York court last year sentenced to nearly 10
years in prison on charges including extortion.
	   Levinson said unnamed sources had told him that Mikhailov had
been personally in charge of two ``combat brigades'' specializing
in assassination, and that his organization had taken over
businesses in a number of American cities.
	   Clark said the files on which Levinson based his testimony were
certain to contain ``general information, gossip, reports from the
media and deliberately planted misinformation.''
	   Speaking outside the court, Clark denied that it was strange
that Americans were fighting it out in a Swiss court.
	   ``What I find extremely strange is that American FBI agents
testify in Swiss courts about Russians and their actions in Russia.
What do they know?'' he said.
	   During Clark's time with the administration of President Lyndon
Johnson in the 1960s, the number of cases brought against organized
crime figures increase sixfold, but he said it was not odd that he
was now appearing for the defense.
	   ``The purpose of both is to find the truth, and it is a healthy
society where you can change from one side to the other and an
unhealthy society where you can't, if you are looking for the
truth,'' said Clark.
	   The trial of Mikhailov, 40, is now into its second week. If
convicted he faces a maximum of seven-and-a-half years in prison.

Top Bosnian Serb in custody pleads innocent to genocide charges
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The top Bosnian Serb war crimes
suspect in U.N. custody _ a general accused of overseeing the 1995
massacre of thousands of Muslims _ pleaded innocent Monday to
genocide charges.
	   At his arraignment before the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, Gen.
Radislav Krstic also pleaded innocent to crimes against humanity
and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions.
	   Krstic, arrested last week by U.S. members of the NATO
peacekeeping force in Bosnia, is the most senior Serb military
officer to be tried for atrocities during the Bosnian war.
	   A trial date was not immediately set Monday for Krstic, who is
being held in the U.N. court's high-security cell block outside The
Hague. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment.
	   Krstic, wearing a green suit, white shirt and tie, was allowed
to remain seated as he entered his pleas. His lawyer, Nenad
Petrusic, told presiding Judge Claude Jorda of France that Krstic
was suffering from serious injuries which made it difficult for him
to stand up. Krstic reportedly lost part of his right leg after
stepping on a mine in 1994.
	   The 50-year-old general leaned forward and listened carefully as
his indictment was read. It alleges the offenses occurred following
the Serb takeover of the U.N. ``safe haven'' of Srebrenica in
eastern Bosnia in July 1995.
	   According to the indictment, forces under Krstic and Bosnian
Serb wartime military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic ``either expelled or
killed'' most members of the enclave's Bosnian Muslim population,
using automatic weapons, hand grenades and other weaponry.
	   Krstic planned and assisted in the ``preparation or execution of
a planned and organized mass execution of thousands of captured
Bosnian Muslim men,'' reads the indictment, which was issued in
October and made public only last week. It had been kept secret so
he wouldn't be prompted to flee.
	   The killings, described in the indictment as ``wide-scale and
organized,'' allegedly occurred in several locations in and around
the enclave, including a warehouse and schools.
	   Soldiers under Krstic's command used heavy equipment to bury the
victims in mass graves. When the international community learned of
the killings, Krstic and his units dug up the bodies and
transferred them to other graves, the indictment alleges.
	   Krstic is believed to be a close associate of Mladic and former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, the tribunal's top two
suspects. Both have been indicted for the massacres at Srebrenica;
both remain at large.
	   The tribunal was established in 1993 by the U.N. Security
Council to prosecute genocide and war crimes stemming from the
armed clashes in the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.

Philippine Airlines says it needs dlrs 150 million in capital to
</HEADLINE>
recover
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Ailing Philippine Airlines said
Monday it needs dlrs 150 million in new capital and a drastic
reduction in its operations to recover from years of huge financial
losses.
	   PAL submitted a rehabilitation plan Monday to Manila's corporate
watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission, calling for new
capital, a cut in its workforce, elimination of more than half of
its fleet, and the abandonment of unprofitable routes.
	   The plan must be approved by the SEC and the airline's local and
foreign creditors, to whom it owes dlrs 2.1 billion.
	   Antonio Ocampo, chairman of a five-man committee that prepared
the plan, said it will provide ``a strong platform for the airline
to recover and become profitable.''
	   PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept. 23 following labor
disputes and mounting losses worsened by Asia's financial crisis.
It then began negotiations with a prospective investor, Cathay
Pacific Airways, but the Hong Kong carrier announced last week it
was pulling out of the talks.
	   President Joseph Estrada said he still hopes he can convince
officials of the two companies to resume negotiations.
	   If the proposed rehabilitation plan is approved, local
investors, including PAL chairman and chief stockholder Lucio Tan,
will invest dlrs 90 million of the dlrs 150 million needed by the
airline, PAL said in a statement.
	   The rest would be provided within six months by a still
undetermined ``strategic partner,'' the airline said.
	   Although the talks with Cathay Pacific collapsed, the plan says
PAL should continue seeking a partner, preferably a foreign airline
that could provide capital and management expertise.
	   The 136-page plan also calls for the downsizing of PAL's fleet
from 53 to 22 aircraft, abandonment of unprofitable routes, and a
reduction of workers from 12,986 to 8,589. Some of these have
already been undertaken by PAL.
	   PAL could resume payments to its creditors if the plan is
approved, the airline said. The SEC has allowed the carrier to stop
payments on its debt pending a decision on the survival plan.

Italian president holds court for language students
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, a former magistrate, held court Monday for students of
Italian, fielding questions on leadership, asylum-seekers -- and
the corruption of his native tongue.
	   On the second day of an official visit to Australia, the first
time an Italian head of state has visited here in 10 years,
Scalfaro spent more than an hour addressing Italian students and
their teachers.
	   Unwinding in the informal atmosphere of a University of
Melbourne lecture hall, he took time out from a busy schedule to
answer questions about what makes a good leader, Italy's future in
a united Europe and the creep of English words and phrases into the
language.
	   Italian professors at the talk said later they were impressed
with Scalfaro's open and relaxed attitude, saying he was
surprisingly outspoken on issues such as opening borders to
refugees.
	   ``He said, `How can he in Melbourne speak out and say Italy
should deny asylum-seekers asylum in Italy and work in Italy when
Australia has opened its arms to so many Italians?''' La Trobe
University Italian Studies chair John Gatt-Rutter said.
	   The 80-year-old president, who leaves Tuesday for Canberra on
the second stage of his weeklong visit, also attended an Italian
Chamber of Commerce and Industry gathering, and an official state
reception hosted by Victoria state Premier Jeff Kennett.
	   The reception was attended by an enthusiastic crowd of about 300
Italian community and business leaders, including Bruno Grollo,
whose plans for the world's tallest tower received the green light
from the government Monday.
	   In another boost to the morale of the Italian community, Kennett
used the occasion to announce a change of name for a square on
Melbourne's Lygon Street Italian precinct, from Argyle Square to
Piazza Italia, and the establishment of an Italian cultural
think-tank.
	   After dining out at top Italian restaurant Scusa Mi last night,
the president was planning a quiet night tonight at Government
House, where he is the guest of Victoria's Italian-born Governor,
Sir James Gobbo, a spokeswoman said.
	   He is accompanied on his trip by an official delegation of 18 --
diplomatic, military and judicial affairs counsellors as well as
his personal physician and interpreter -- and about the same number
of journalists.

Hard-line party wins Turkish Cypriots elections

 &UR; EDS: RECASTS throughout with initial results, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Dervis Eroglu, prime minister in the
breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, was declared the
winner Monday in parliamentary elections in a show of approval for
the government's hard-line stance in efforts to reunify the divided
island.
	   According to initial results, Eroglu, 60, clinched 40.3 percent
of the votes, winning 24 of 50 seats in Parliament in Sunday's
voting, the Turkish Cypriot news agency TAK reported. It was not
clear if he would be able to govern alone or would have to form a
coalition with another party.
	   ``It is a victory for our national cause,'' said Rauf Denktash,
president of the breakaway state. ``The victory of a majority that
is loyal to Turkey, and determined to keep the Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus living, should be a nice message to the world.''
	   The elections were marred by a row between Denktash and an
opposition center-left party. Denktash has accused the party of
trying to undermine the Turkish Cypriot cause by favoring the
island's membership in the European Union.
	   Denktash contends Cyprus' membership in the EU would amount to
the island's integration with EU-member Greece and opposes entry
before Turkey is made a member of the EU.
	   The tensions increased when Denktash openly called on voters to
vote for center-right parties _ including one led by his son,
Serdar Dentash _ which he regards as loyal to Turkey.
	   Serdar Denktash' Democrat Party got 22.6 percent of the votes
and is likely to take 13 of the parliamentary seats, while the
center-left Republican Turkish Party got 13.3 percent with only 6
seats.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkey sent in troops
after a coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece. The
Turkish Cypriots declared their own state in 1983 but it is only
recognized by Turkey.
	   Numerous United Nations efforts to reunify the island have
failed. Denktash is now demanding international recognition for his
state before talks can resume.
	   Turkish Cypriot opposition parties complained that the election
would be dominated by the large number of settlers from the Turkish
mainland who have been given voting rights.
	   A recent report by the European Union Commission put the number
of recent settlers at 111,000 out of a population of 200,000.
Opposition parties say about half the candidates are settlers.
	   More than 87 percent of the some 121,000 eligible voters turned
up at voting stations on Sunday.

expansion &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The EU foreign ministers sought to keep
the European Union's expansion drive alive Monday by trying to
sound welcoming to newcomers without committing to any specific
entry dates.
	   Hampering the EU is a disagreement on how to fund a
near-doubling of the ranks and how fast to expand the union, issues
that will dominate a two-day summit opening Friday in Vienna.
	   Even so, the foreign ministers planned to send the EU leaders an
upbeat report declaring efforts to bring Cyprus and 10 East
European nations and, possibly, Malta into the EU in the next
decade are well on track.
	   Negotiations opened this fall with Cyprus, Hungary, Poland, the
Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia and preliminary talks with
slower-track candidates Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and
Bulgaria.
	   The EU refuses to set firm entry dates to ensure candidates keep
up their reform efforts to get in shape for EU membership.
	   The first newcomers won't likely join until 2004 or 2005.

Trapped U.N. peacekeepers evacuated from areas of fighting in
</HEADLINE>
Angola

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The United Nations has evacuated 14 of its
peacekeepers who were trapped by fighting between the army and the
rebel group UNITA in two towns in central Angola, a U.N. spokesman
said Monday.
	   The peace monitors _ a Swede, a Brazilian, a Senegalese, and 11
Indians _ are due to arrive in the capital Luanda within 24 hours,
spokesman Hamadoun Toure said in a statement.
	   Toure said the men were withdrawn Sunday from the UNITA
strongholds Andulo and Bailundo, about 290 kilometers (180 miles)
southeast of Luanda, and taken to Huambo, 200 kilometers (125
miles) southwest of Andulo.
	   ``They are all well. Their morale is high, they are in good
health and good spirits,'' Toure said.
	   The peacekeepers will fly from Luanda to their home countries,
according to Toure.
	   Andulo and Bailundo, where the UNITA leadership is based,
reportedly are under attack by government forces in the latest
fighting to threaten the crumbling 1994 peace pact between the two
sides.
	   The government accused UNITA of using the peacekeepers as human
shields to ward off attack. In a statement Friday, the U.N.
Security Council said it would hold UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi
personally responsible for the safety of the monitors.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ has yielded control of most of the
country it once held to the government, but the group has refused
to relinquish its last strongholds despite U.N. pressure.
	   Continuing hostility between the two sides has hindered
implementation of the peace deal, and no progress has been made
since June.
	   The government says UNITA has about 30,000 armed men hidden in

Seven Afghan smugglers killed in Iran, 1.5 tons of drugs seized
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Seven Afghan drug traffickers were killed
during clashes with police in the northeastern Khorasan province,
the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday.
	   During the clashes, which occurred over the past two days,
police arrested another seven Afghan drug smugglers and seized some
1.5 metric tons (1.65 tons) of narcotics, the agency said.
	   The drugs seized included 1,386 kilos (3,049 pounds) of opium
and 106 kilos (233 pounds) of heroin, the agency said.
	   Large drug hauls are common in Iran, which lies along a route
used by smugglers in neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan to
transport drugs such as opium, hashish and heroin to Gulf Arab
states and beyond.
	   Drug smugglers face the death penalty under Iranian law.
Hundreds have been hanged since the law was passed nine years ago.

Government lawyers said to be ``careful'' in investigating Suharto
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to emphasize that Suharto to be question on Wednesday

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's attorney general said
Monday he would question former President Suharto this week over
corruption allegations, but stressed he needs to be extra careful
in his investigation of the ex-leader.
	   Attorney General Andi Mohammad Ghalib said he would quiz Suharto
on Wednesday.
	   However, he told a committee of lawmakers in Parliament that
Suharto had not been named as a suspect despite mounting calls by
student protesters and others that he be tried for alleged graft
and human rights abuses.
	   ``We have to be careful and not carelessly say that he is a
suspect,'' he said.
	   Suharto, 77, was forced to quit last May after a wave of
protests and riots. Since then, his opponents, including students
activists, have demanded that he be prosecuted.
	   Suharto has denied accusations that he illegally enriched
himself, his family and cronies during his 32-year rule.
	   Earlier this year Forbes magazine estimated Suharto's wealth at
dlrs 4 billion. However, he has flatly denied claims that he has
stashed a fortune away in foreign bank accounts.
	   Ghalib questioned Suharto several months ago during an earlier
investigation that failed to find any evidence against the former
president.
	   Suharto's successor and onetime protege, President B.J. Habibie,
last week ordered Ghalib to step up his investigation after a new
wave of student protests in the capital city.
	   Meanwhile, the attorney general's office plans to question
former trade and industry ministers Mohamad ``Bob'' Hasan and Tunky
Ariwibowo on Tuesday, an official said.
	   Barman Zahir, spokesman for the office, said it would quiz
timber tycoon and close Suharto associate Hasan about involvement
in seven charitable foundations linked to the former president.
	   Zahir said the attorney general's office will also question
Hedianto, the secretary of Suharto's Dharmais charitable
foundation.
	   Tunky would be asked about his role in a so-called ``national
car'' project, through which Suharto's son Hutomo ``Tommy'' Mandala
Putra was licensed to import cars from Korea's Kia Motors Corp.
through his PT Timor Distribusi National, without having to pay
import tariffs.
	   In a written submission to Parliament, Ghalib said Suharto had
handed over the seven charitable foundations worth dlrs 530 million
that were established during his three decades in power.
	   Also, Ghalib's office has checked about 70 banks in Indonesia
and found five bank accounts in Suharto's name worth 23.3 billion
rupiah (dlrs 3.1 million).
	   He said Suharto owned about 10 hectares of land in the capital
city, Jakarta, 30 hectares in Yogyakarta and 265,984 hectares of
forest on the island of Borneo.
	   ``Currently, we are investigating whether those assets were
acquired illegally,'' Ghalib said.

Cyclone Thelma intensifies; Darwin warned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ The most severe cyclone since Cyclone
Tracy, which almost wiped out Darwin in 1974, is slowly moving
toward the territorial capital Monday night.
	   Cyclone Thelma's outer edge was expected to hit the Top End
capital Tuesday afternoon, the Bureau of Meteorology warned.
	   ``Very destructive'' winds of up to 135 mph (220 kph) were
expected to lash Bathurst and Melville islands, 62 miles (100 km)
north of Darwin, on Tuesday.
	   A 40-year-old office cleaner on Melville Island said she and her
family were listening to the radio and television and were prepared
to evacuate if the cyclone hit.
	   ``It's very bad, the wind and the seas, they are very rough and
the rain she is very strong,'' said the woman, who gave her name
only as Mrs. Woimaenirri.
	   ``We are sitting here with both the radio and the television on
just waiting to see if we must go to the sports and rec (hall)''
for shelter.
	   ``That's where we went during Tracy but this is not as bad but I
am a little bit scared.''
	   Mrs. Woimaenirri said she still remembered Cyclone Tracy as a
teen-ager, watching ``trees and tins and tin sheds all flying
around.''
	   Since Cyclone Tracy -- a category four cyclone with winds
measured at 134 mph (217 kph) before the measuring instruments
broke -- all but destroyed Darwin on Christmas Eve 1974, only four
cyclones have directly affected Darwin.
	   Cyclone Tracy killed 66 people and damaged 95 percent of
Darwin's houses.

Trapped U.N. peacekeepers evacuated from areas of fighting in
</HEADLINE>
Angola &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The United Nations has evacuated 14 of its
peacekeepers who were trapped by fighting between the army and the
rebel group UNITA in two towns in central Angola, a U.N. spokesman
said Monday.
	   The peace monitors _ a Swede, a Brazilian, a Senegalese, and 11
Indians _ are due to arrive in the capital Luanda within 24 hours,
spokesman Hamadoun Toure said in a statement.
	   Toure said the men were withdrawn Sunday from the UNITA
strongholds Andulo and Bailundo, about 290 kilometers (180 miles)
southeast of Luanda, and taken to Huambo, 200 kilometers (125
miles) southwest of Andulo.
	   ``They are all well. Their morale is high, they are in good
health and good spirits,'' Toure said.
	   The peacekeepers will fly from Luanda to their home countries,
according to Toure.
	   Andulo and Bailundo, where the UNITA leadership is based,
reportedly are under attack by government forces in the latest
fighting to threaten the crumbling 1994 peace pact between the two
sides.
	   The government accused UNITA of using the peacekeepers as human
shields to ward off attack. In a statement Friday, the U.N.
Security Council said it would hold UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi
personally responsible for the safety of the monitors.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ has yielded control of most of the
country it once held to the government, but the group has refused
to relinquish its last strongholds despite U.N. pressure.
	   Continuing hostility between the two sides has hindered
implementation of the peace deal, and no progress has been made
since June.
	   The government says UNITA has about 30,000 armed men hidden in
the bush of the vast southwest African nation.
	   The civil war broke out following Angola's 1975 independence
from Portugal, and some 500,000 people were killed in the fighting.

Russian ruble plunges further, World Bank team arrives for talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A team of experts from the World Bank arrived in
Moscow for more loan talks Monday as the battered Russian ruble
continued to slip, heading for a record low since financial crisis
hit Russia in August.
	   The World Bank experts were to reconsider the terms of a earlier
promised dlrs 1.5 billion loan for structural reform, as well as a
dlrs 800 million social reform credit and a dlrs 800 million loan
to streamline the ailing coal industry, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The team will make recommendations to the World Bank board of
directors later this month, when it discusses its strategy on
Russia.
	   The loans are part of an IMF-led dlrs 22.3 billion bailout
package that was agreed upon before economic crisis forced the
government to devalue the ruble and put a 90-day moratorium on
foreign debt Aug. 17.
	   Meanwhile, the ruble plunged again in trading Monday, closing at
20.4 to the dollar, down 0.8 from Friday. The ruble sold for more
than 20 to the dollar for a couple of days shortly after the
country's economic crisis hit in mid-August before making a modest
comeback.
	   The currency remained relatively stable through most of the
autumn, trading at around 16 to the dollar before resuming a steady
fall at the end of last month. The ruble was at about 6 to the
dollar before the crisis.
	   With Russian financial markets virtually wiped out by the
crisis, the ruble has become the main indicator of economic
confidence. Its fall reflects fears that the government will flood
the economy with a lot of new cash to pay its huge debts _ a move
that is certain to trigger high inflation.
	   The Cabinet of Prime Minister Yevegny Primakov has said it may
have to print large amounts of money if international lenders,
including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, don't
release the loan package agreed last summer and put on hold after
the crisis hit.
	   In talks last week, the IMF urged Russia to provide a realistic
budget for next year as a key condition for resuming loans, but
showed no sign that it would free the money any time soon. IMF
experts have criticized the government's tax collection targets as
overly optimistic and criticized its economic blueprint for being
overloaded with state interference.
	   Until the IMF acts, other foreign lenders are unlikely to give
Russia the infusion of cash it needs to pay workers, pensioners and
foreign creditors.

At least 10 killed in fighting in southern Somali port town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with WFP saying ship unaffected, adds details on
delegation visit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ At least 10 people were killed and
more than 15 wounded in clashes between rival militiamen in the
southern Somali port town of Merca, reports from the town said
Monday.
	   Fighting between rival factions of the Habar Gidir clan erupted
Sunday in downtown Merca, about 100 kilometers (65 miles) south of
the capital Mogadishu, forcing local markets to close, according to
witnesses contacted by VHF radio.
	   Three people were killed and five wounded during an early
exchange between the rival Eyr and Sa'ad subclans, which control
different parts of Merca, witnesses said.
	   Later in the evening, fighting intensified around the hospital,
where a prominent militiaman was being treated for wounds suffered
earlier in the day. Another seven people, including a woman
bystander, were killed and 10 wounded, the reports said.
	   A U.N. World Food Program ship, which was off-loading food aid
at the Merca port, was not affected by the fighting, the agency
said Monday.
	   It was unclear what sparked Sunday's clashes, but it may be
connected to fighting between the same factions two months ago at
Shalambod, a town 15 kilometers (10 miles) north of Merca.
	   Sunday's fighting followed Saturday's visit of an international
peace delegation which included Italy's ambassador to Somalia. The
port town is a large export-import hub for Italian businessmen.
	   The delegation had planned to go to Mogadishu to meet with Ali
Mahdi Mohamed and Hussein Mohamed Aidid, former rivals who joined
forces recently to set up a municipal administration for Mogadishu,
and also with their opponents Hussein Hajji Bod and Ali Osman Atto
to try to iron out differences between the factions.
	   The delegation decided at the last minute to land in Merca after
assessing security at the north Mogadishu airstrip was
insufficient, according to an international aid worker who asked
not to be identified.
	   Aidid, a Sa'ad, and Ali Mahdi, took offense and told the
delegation to leave Somalia, which it did the same day.
	   Aid agencies use the Merca airstrip as a transit point since it
is more secure than north Mogadishu, bringing foreign currency into
Merca and upsetting the Mogadishu administration.
	   A demonstration of Aidid and Ali Mahdi supporters in Mogadishu
Sunday burned Italian flags and accused Italian Ambassador
Francesco Shortino of undermining efforts to reunite the formerly
divided capital.
	   Somalia has been wracked by clan fighting and civil war since
faction leaders collaborated in 1991 to oust President Mohamed Siad
Barre, but afterwards turned on each other.
	   Somalia has since been without a central government, and carved
into faction-controlled fiefdoms protected by fighting militiamen.

Top Bosnian Serb in custody pleads innocent to genocide charges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo planned &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The top Bosnian Serb war crimes
suspect in U.N. custody _ a general accused of overseeing the 1995
massacre of thousands of Muslims _ pleaded innocent Monday to
genocide charges.
	   At his arraignment before the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, Gen.
Radislav Krstic also pleaded innocent to crimes against humanity
and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions.
	   Krstic, arrested last week by U.S. members of the NATO
peacekeeping force in Bosnia, is the most senior Serb military
officer to be tried for atrocities during the Bosnian war.
	   A trial date was not immediately set Monday for Krstic, who is
being held in the U.N. court's high-security cell block outside The
Hague. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment.
	   Krstic, wearing a green suit, white shirt and tie, was allowed
to remain seated as he entered his pleas. His lawyer, Nenad
Petrusic, told presiding Judge Claude Jorda of France that Krstic
was suffering from serious injuries which made it difficult for him
to stand up. Krstic reportedly lost part of his right leg after
stepping on a mine in 1994.
	   The 50-year-old general leaned forward and listened carefully as
his indictment was read. It alleges the offenses occurred following
the Serb takeover of the U.N. ``safe haven'' of Srebrenica in
eastern Bosnia in July 1995.
	   According to the indictment, forces under Krstic and Bosnian
Serb wartime military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic ``either expelled or
killed'' most members of the enclave's Bosnian Muslim population,
using automatic weapons, hand grenades and other weaponry.
	   Krstic planned and assisted in the ``preparation or execution of
a planned and organized mass execution of thousands of captured
Bosnian Muslim men,'' reads the indictment, which was issued in
October and made public only last week. It had been kept secret so
he wouldn't be prompted to flee.
	   The killings, described in the indictment as ``wide-scale and
organized,'' allegedly occurred in several locations in and around
the enclave, including a warehouse and schools.
	   Soldiers under Krstic's command used heavy equipment to bury the
victims in mass graves. When the international community learned of
the killings, Krstic and his units dug up the bodies and
transferred them to other graves, the indictment alleges.
	   Krstic is believed to be a close associate of Mladic and former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, the tribunal's top two
suspects. Both have been indicted for the massacres at Srebrenica;
both remain at large.
	   The tribunal was established in 1993 by the U.N. Security
Council to prosecute genocide and war crimes stemming from the
armed clashes in the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.

Gunman surrenders after nine-hour hostage drama

<TEXT>
	   HASTINGS, New Zealand (AP) _ A gunman who held a police SWAT
team at bay for more than nine hours, surrendered Monday after
taking a woman hostage in the downtown office of the local member
of Parliament.
	   The man, only identified as a 50-year-old welfare beneficiary
who has pestered local legislators over a legal grievance, walked
from the building with his arms extended in front of him to be met
by a ring of armed police.
	   ``Everything's back under control, the offender has given
himself up and is in custody,'' Senior Sgt. Mike Wilkinson told The
Associated Press.
	   Electorate secretary Jan Woodhall, held hostage at the point of
a shotgun throughout the day, came out of the building about 10
minutes later with a policewoman and was driven away.
	   The gunman's surrender came after several hours of telephone
talks with police negotiators. Earlier the man tried to telephone
prominent people including Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and Labor
opposition leader Helen Clark. Neither took the calls.
	   Member of Parliament Rick Barker was not at his office in
Hastings at the time the drama began mid-morning.
	   Police evacuated people working in surrounding buildings, and
half a dozen blocks were cordoned off in the rural town on the east
coast of New Zealand's north island.
	   Barker has a court order preventing the armed man, who is known
to him as a frequent letter writer with a number of grievances,
from pestering him.
	   Independent legislator Neil Kirton said all the members of
Parliament in the region had been severely harassed by the man.
	   He said the man's harassment related occasionally to his court
conviction for benefit fraud.
	   ``But it went much broader than that. He saw a great conspiracy
under every government and arm of state. The language he uses is
just appalling. He wades in to everyone with the most vile of
comments,'' Kirton said.
	   Hastings is about 160 miles (260 km) northeast of Wellington,
the capital, and 220 miles (355 km) southeast of Auckland.
	   The incident is believed to be the first involving firearms and
a member of Parliament since 1996, when a woman was arrested with
an air pistol at Parliament trying to get to the office of former
Prime Minister David Lange.
	   The Asian woman claimed to be an illegitimate daughter of
Britain's Queen Elizabeth II.
	   The gas-operated air pistol was found in her bag after she was
stopped by security staff while trying to get a pass into
Parliament House.

ScottishPower announces merger with PacifiCorp

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ ScottishPower PLC on Monday announced an agreed
4.7 billion pound (dlrs 7.8 billion) merger - widely seen as a
takeover _ of the U.S. electricity utility PacifiCorp.
	   The new group, which will reportedly be the world's largest
multi-utility group, will be based in Glasgow and will retain the
ScottishPower name and its primary listing in London, the company
said.
	   Its U.S. head office will be in Portland, Oregon.
	   If approved, the deal _ expected to close late next year _ would
be the first time a foreign company has acquired a U.S. utility.
	   The merger must, however, get past a U.S. law limiting foreign
ownership of electricity distribution.
	   It needs approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and some U.S. state utility
companies.
	   Under the terms of the deal, each PacifiCorp share will be
exchanged for 0.58 American Depository Receipts or 2.32 ordinary
shares of ScottishPower.
	   ScottishPower said if the deal goes ahead it will return 500
million pounds (dlrs 830 million) to its investors in a share
buyback.
	   ScottishPower chairman Murray Stuart will become chairman of the
new group. Alan Richardson, power systems managing director at the
Scottish utility, will become chief executive officer of
PacifiCorp.
	   The value of the new company, the British Broadcasting Corp.
said, will be 12 billion pounds (dlrs 19.9 billion).
	   PacifiCorp shareholders will own around 36 percent of the new
company, and ScottishPower shareholders 64 percent.
	   In a statement, ScottishPower said that _ before writing off the
value of goodwill over a period _ the takeover was expected to
improve share earnings from the first full year after the deal
closed.
	   ``ScottishPower believes that it will create significant value
for shareholders by transferring to PacifiCorp its proven skills in
improving customer service and delivering cost efficiencies,'' the
statement said.
	   However, ScottishPower shares dropped, falling 29 pence (48
cents), or 4.3 percent, to 646 pence (1072 cents).
	   ScottishPower supplies gas, water, electricity and phone
services to 5 million British homes and has some 15,000 employees.
	   PacifiCorp, the third largest utility west of the Mississippi,
has 1.4 million customers in seven states and about 10,000
employees. It is the holding company for Pacific Power and Utah
Power.
	   PacifiCorp Chairman Keith McKennon said the deal will help the
company concentrate on its core electricity business.
	   London stockbroker Williams De Broe downgraded ScottishPower to
``hold'' from ``buy'' on news of the merger.
	   ``PacifiCorp's underlying earnings per share have been falling
over the last 18 months and the market may need some reassurance
over this,'' said analyst Nigel Hawkins.
	   Both companies have tried before to make a trans-Altlantic deal.
	   ScottishPower's previous attempts _ with Florida Light and
Power, and then Cinergy, foundered on disagreements about
management. In May, PacifiCorp lost a bid to acquire Britain's
Energy Group PLC.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A house fire in a Ukrainian village killed
a 6-year-old girl and left three other children hospitalized, the
Emergency Situations Ministry reported Monday.
	   Sunday's fire in Iverska, a village in the eastern Donetsk
region, was caused by a faulty homemade heater, the ministry said.
	   Unusually cold winter weather hit Ukraine early this year,
prompting some residents to use homemade heating devices to warm
their houses because of often erratic energy supplies.

Choi's two goals lift South Korea over archrival Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In a clash between the 2002 World Cup
co-hosts, veteran striker Choi Yong-soo scored two unanswered goals
Monday to lift South Korea over archrival Japan, opening the second
round of Asian Games soccer competition.
	   Choi's goals, added to his four from the first round, briefly
tied him with Farj Laheeb of Kuwait as the top Asian Games goal
scorer. But Laheeb moved back ahead later in Monday's second Group
J match against the United Arab Emirates.
	   Waving flags and banging gongs, Bangkok's large South Korean
community turned out in noisy droves at the Rajamangala National
Stadium, site of Monday's lavish opening ceremonies.
	   ``Although you see some Koreans saying, `Japan, go to hell,'
when they see the Japanese crowds waving their flags, I don't think
it's because of ill feelings,'' said one of them, Lee Yong-chan,
35, a businessman.
	   ``It's more of a competitive feeling you have toward an
opponent,'' Lee said.
	   The Korean side, which included a share of World Cup veterans,
dominated the midfield with a quick pace and inventive tactics.
Midfielder Yoo Sang-chul set up a pair of shots that narrowly
missed in the first five minutes.
	   Japan's midfielder Shunsuke Nakamura, supported by Shinji Ono,
almost single-handedly dragged the young side back into the match.
	   But French coach Philippe Troussier's under-21s _ seeking
experience for the 2000 Olympics _ found a hard lesson under the
hot Bangkok sun.
	   ``My players are exhausted from the traveling,'' Troussier said
after the match.
	   ``In the first round, they had to travel to Trang province and
in the second round, the stadium and the athletes village are quite
far apart, so my athletes had little time to rest,'' he added.
	   Nakamura was one of the few bright spots for Japan. He lofted a
free kick over the Korean wall about two meters in front of
flailing keeper Kim Byung-ji, which Masihiro Koga barely missed
punching home. Japan missed such chances to finish all afternoon.
	   Korean playmaker Choi Sung-yong then started opening up the
weaknesses on the Japanese right. Choi had a goal lined up in the
31st minute when keeper Yuta Minami dragged him down in the goal
area, setting up a penalty.
	   Choi Yong-soo fired it home, putting South Korea ahead 1-0. Ono
lost a chance to equalize off a free kick in the 45th minute with a
blistering shot off the cross bar.
	   In the first minute of the second half, Choi Yong-soo took a
shot from the penalty area that bounced off the cross bar, into the
far post and then into the net past the pirhouetting Minami.
	   He nearly had a hat trick six minutes later when he took a
diving header off a low cross by Yoo Sang-chul, but Minami caught
it.
	   The South Koreans dominated the rest of a generally sloppy
match, with Japan creating few chances and the Koreans content to
sit on their lead.
	   ``The environment of Thailand is hot and humid,'' said Korea's
coach, Huh Jung-moo. ``My players needed a few days in order to
adapt to it, and now they are used to it.''
	   Group J is the toughest of the four groups that emerged from the
original 23-team field. Japan faces Kuwait on Wednesday, while
South Korea takes on the United Arab Emirates. The top two sides
will advance to the quarterfinals.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Khmer Rouge guerrilla commanders,
who surrendered in the jungles of Cambodia last week, traveled to
Phnom Penh on Monday and met government leaders they have spent
decades trying to vanquish.
	   The surrender of rebel chief of staff Khem Ngun and seven other
generals on Friday dealt the final blow to the Maoist movement that
killed nearly 2 million Cambodians during its 1975-79 rule.
	   The guerrillas have waged civil war against successive Cambodian
governments ever since.
	   Still at large, however, are Ta Mok _ known as ``the Butcher'' _
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, the sinister trio of leaders who
oversaw the field commanders and their guerrillas.
	   The Cambodian government and the United States have said they
want the three captured and tried for genocide and crimes against
humanity.
	   At a press conference on Monday, Khem Ngun insisted he severed
contacts with the three in April after government troops overran
their stronghold of Anlong Veng.
	   ``I don't know where to find them,'' Khem Ngun said. ``I've been
in the jungle a long time and I know that it is very difficult to
find one or two people in the jungle.''
	   Khem Ngun and four other rebel generals met with political and
military representatives of Prime Minister Hun Sen, the man they
have spent years denouncing as an illegitimate leader controlled by
neighboring Vietnam.
	   Although he has been negotiating with the Cambodian military
since May, Khem Ngun said the formation of Hun Sen's new coalition
government late last month and the international recognition it has
received convinced the guerrillas to give up their fight.
	   ``This is the final end that will bring about peace for
development,'' he said. ``There will be no more (military)
struggle, only a struggle to solve social and economic issues,
raise Cambodians' living standards and build more schools and
hospitals.''
	   Khem Ngun said 20,000 rebel civilians and soldiers _ a number
military analysts say is likely inflated _ will soon be integrated
into mainstream Cambodian society. Most of the people living under
the Khmer Rouge were forced into refugee camps in neighboring
Thailand when Anlong Veng fell to the government.
	   A team of legal experts appointed by the United Nations visited
Cambodia last month to assess evidence for a possible international
tribunal against the Khmer Rouge leaders.
	   Youk Chhang, director of a U.S.-funded center that has cataloged
evidence against the Khmer Rouge, says enough documentation was
left behind by the guerrillas in 1979 to prove members of the
movement's inner circle committed crimes against humanity.
	   Capturing Ta Mok and the others should not be difficult if a
serious effort is made, Youk Chhang said.
	   ``I don't think they can hide. They are in touch with society
either in Cambodia or Thailand,'' he said.
	   Hun Sen's resolve to bring the Khmer Rouge to justice, however,
was called into question last week when he proposed a trial be held
in Cambodia using the local legal code so the rebels could be tried
in absentia.
	   Hun Sen's spokesman Prak Sokhon said Monday that the government
remained committed to bringing Ta Mok, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea
to trial.
	   ``The three cannot escape prosecution by the court, which the
prime minister said should be a Cambodian court assisted by the
international community,'' he said.
	   Prak Sokhon did not mention Ieng Sary, the Khmer Rouge deputy
prime minister who defected to the government in 1996 with
thousands of guerrillas, severely weakening the movement.
	   Ieng Sary received amnesty from King Norodom Sihanouk, but the
king said the pardon did not cover any international attempt to
bring him to justice.

Top Bosnian Serb in custody pleads innocent to genocide charges

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The top Bosnian Serb war crimes
suspect in U.N. custody _ a general accused of overseeing the 1995
massacre of thousands of Muslims _ pleaded innocent Monday to
genocide charges.
	   At his arraignment before the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, Gen.
Radislav Krstic also pleaded innocent to crimes against humanity
and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions.
	   ``I plead not guilty,'' Krstic, 50, said calmly and clearly as
each charge was read out.
	   Krstic, arrested last week by U.S. members of the NATO
peacekeeping force in Bosnia, is the most senior Serb military
officer to be tried for atrocities during the Bosnian war.
	   A trial date was not immediately set Monday for Krstic, who is
being held in the U.N. court's high-security cell block outside The
Hague. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment.
	   Krstic, wearing a green suit, white shirt and tie, was allowed
to remain seated as he entered his pleas. His lawyer, Nenad
Petrusic, told presiding Judge Claude Jorda of France that Krstic
was suffering from serious injuries which made it difficult for him
to stand up. Krstic lost part of his right leg, reportedly after
stepping on a mine in 1994.
	   Petrusic described Krstic's health as ``truly, seriously
imperiled,'' and said there was a chance of gangrene where the limb
was amputated.
	   Asked by Jorda how he felt, Krstic said: ``As well as can be
expected on the whole, but I am tired after the arrest.
Exhausted.'' Krstic also complained that there was no heating in
his U.N. cell and that he was receiving no therapy for his injured
leg.
	   His indictment accuses him of involvement in atrocities that
occurred following the Serb takeover of the U.N. ``safe haven'' of
Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia in July 1995. Prosecutor Brenda Hollis
said she would likely call between 50 and 70 witnesses at the
trial, which is expected to last for months.
	   According to the indictment, forces under Krstic and Bosnian
Serb wartime military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic ``either expelled or
killed'' most members of the enclave's Bosnian Muslim population,
using automatic weapons, hand grenades and other weaponry.
	   Krstic planned and assisted in the ``preparation or execution of
a planned and organized mass execution of thousands of captured
Bosnian Muslim men,'' reads the indictment, which was issued in
October and made public only last week. It had been kept secret so
he wouldn't be prompted to flee.
	   The killings, described in the indictment as ``wide-scale and
organized,'' allegedly occurred in several locations in and around
the enclave, including a warehouse and schools.
	   Soldiers under Krstic's command used heavy equipment to bury the
victims in mass graves. When the international community learned of
the killings, Krstic and his units dug up the bodies and
transferred them to other graves, the indictment alleges.
	   Krstic is believed to be a close associate of Mladic and former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, the tribunal's top two
suspects. Both have been indicted for the massacres at Srebrenica;
both remain at large.
	   The tribunal was established in 1993 by the U.N. Security
Council to prosecute genocide and war crimes stemming from the
armed clashes in the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.

was suffering from serious injuries which made it difficult for him
to stand up. Krstic lost part of his right leg, reportedly after
stepping on a mine in 1994.
	   Petrusic described Krstic's health as ``truly, seriously
imperiled,'' and said there was a chance of gangrene where the limb
was amputated.
	   Asked by Jorda how he felt, Krstic said: ``As well as can be
expected on the whole, but I am tired after the arrest.
Exhausted.'' Krstic also complained that there was no heating in
his U.N. cell and that he was receiving no therapy for his injured
leg.
	   His indictment accuses him of involvement in atrocities that
occurred following the Serb takeover of the U.N. ``safe haven'' of
Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia in July 1995. Prosecutor Brenda Hollis
said she would likely call between 50 and 70 witnesses at the
trial, which is expected to last for months.
	   According to the indictment, forces under Krstic and Bosnian
Serb wartime military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic ``either expelled or
killed'' most members of the enclave's Bosnian Muslim population,
using automatic weapons, hand grenades and other weaponry.
	   Krstic planned and assisted in the ``preparation or execution of
a planned and organized mass execution of thousands of captured
Bosnian Muslim men,'' reads the indictment, which was issued in
October and made public only last week. It had been kept secret so
he wouldn't be prompted to flee.
	   The killings, described in the indictment as ``wide-scale and
organized,'' allegedly occurred in several locations in and around
the enclave, including a warehouse and schools.
	   Soldiers under Krstic's command used heavy equipment to bury the
victims in mass graves. When the international community learned of
the killings, Krstic and his units dug up the bodies and
transferred them to other graves, the indictment alleges.
	   Krstic is believed to be a close associate of Mladic and former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, the tribunal's top two
suspects. Both have been indicted for the massacres at Srebrenica;
both remain at large.
	   The tribunal was established in 1993 by the U.N. Security
Council to prosecute genocide and war crimes stemming from the
armed clashes in the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.

Cuban Interior Ministry Museum a tribute to Cold War espionage

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Poisoned cigars, poisoned pills and a poisoned pen
were just a few of the killing gadgets that figured in the CIA's
unsuccessful schemes to do away with Fidel Castro and his communist
government.
	   Those sinister devices and many more are described in Havana's
Interior Ministry Museum, a tribute to four decades of spying and
plotting against Castro's rule _ and to the Cuban fascination with
Cold War espionage.
	   Inside the yellow mansion on a broad residential avenue of
Havana, glass cases are filled with confiscated spy paraphernalia:
tiny radios and decoders, hidden microphones and miniature cameras,
Thompson machine guns and C-4 plastic explosives.
	   While many Americans might consider the espionage museum a
fascinating Cold War artifact, most Cubans see it as testimony to
practices that still persist.
	   In September, there was little surprise on this side of the
Florida Straits when U.S. authorities in Miami accused 10 people of
spying for Cuba.
	   Castro, in an interview with CNN, said the most surprising thing
about the case was ``that the most spying country in the world is
accusing the most spied-upon country in the world of espionage.''
	   He admitted Cuba has sent a few of its own to spy in what it
considers enemy territory, ``to infiltrate counterrevolutionary
organizations to inform us about activities that are of great
interest to us.''
	   Some such agents are honored at the Interior Ministry Museum.
One glass case contains a bloodstained shirt displayed like a
religious relic. ``Manuel Lopez de la Portilla, 1940-1960,'' the
sign reads. ``Killed July 16, 1960, when his identity was
discovered by a counterrevolutionary group.''
	   The museum recognizes as a martyr Rogelio ``Pao'' Iglesias
Patino, who died in 1983 at age 47 when his boat sank as he
traveled to the United States ``to fulfill a mission within the
columns of the enemy.''
	   The walls of the museum are lined with painted portraits of him
and scores of other men and women who died protecting Cuba's
communist state.
	   They include two young diplomats who were kidnapped from the
Cuban embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and killed, two security
agents who died when a bomb exploded at the Cuban embassy in
Lisbon, Portugal, and an agent who was killed in a dynamite blast
at the Cuban commercial office in Montreal.
	   Below the photographs are the displays: tiny cameras disguised
as disposable plastic lighters, a tin of Hershey's Cocoa stuffed
with detonator capsules, black metal decoders for deciphering
messages printed in a series of tiny baffling numbers legible only
with a magnifying glass.
	   ``Despite the dozens of known acts against the revolutionary
leaders of Cuba by the CIA and its innumerable bands that were in
its service, not one leader of the Revolution has been
assassinated,'' a large blue sign declares proudly.
	   It wasn't for lack of trying.
	   The museum describes dozens of unsuccessful schemes dreamed up
to assassinate Castro.
	   One display tells of a plot in which CIA agents sent a
hypodermic needle disguised as a pen to a major in the Cuban army.
The plot, never carried out, called for the major to fill the
contraption with poison and use it to assassinate Castro.
	   Another display shows scuba diving equipment, machine guns and
pistols seized from an anti-Castro group that penetrated Cuba by
sea.
	   With that kind of history, Cubans have long been fascinated with
espionage _ especially by the United States against their country.
	   Among the books sold at the open-air market at Old Havana's
Plaza de Armas are titles such as ``The Secret Assasination Report:
CIA Targets Fidel,'' and ``The Secret War: CIA Covert Operations
Against Cuba, 1959-62.''
	   While U.S. authorities say Cubans are paranoid, the Cubans say
they are merely realistic.
	   In August, authorities in the Dominican Republic tightened
security shortly before a visit by Castro after receiving reports
about a plot against his life.
	   Around the same time, a U.S. grand jury in San Juan, Puerto
Rico, indicted seven Cuban exiles on charges of plotting to kill
Castro last year during a Latin American summit in Venezuela.
	   Meanwhile, in Havana, a Salvadoran man awaits trial in a series
of bombings of luxury hotels last year, including one that killed
an Italian tourist.
	   As long as such violent schemes and suspected spying continue,
the Cuban government will use all methods _ including spying _ to
protect itself, Castro told CNN.
	   ``We are subjected to ferocious and total espionage,'' he said.

Heavy snow isolates Swedish city
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo available &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Some 70,000 residents of the city of
Gaevle were virtually isolated on Monday after about a meter (3.2
feet) of snow fell overnight and stiff winds formed it into
towering drifts.
	   The Swedish national meteorological service said the 93
centimeters (36 inches) of snow that fell on the coastal city 160
kilometers (100 miles) north of Stockholm was more than it ever has
gotten in the entire month of December.
	   There were no immediate serious injuries reported, but the local
hospital reported a stream of people coming in with broken bones
and other injuries from falls.
	   The national railway SJ cancelled all trains running through
Gaevle, a main junction point, to the north of Sweden until at
least midday Tuesday.
	   The snow significantly lessened in Gaevle around noon on Monday,
as the storm system moved to the southwest. The main part of the
storm was expected to skirt Stockholm, where four days of moderate
but consistent snow has caused traffic snarls and delays of an hour
for planes taking off from the capital's airports.

Railroad chief says strike makes company, clients suffer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The head of France's state-run railroad, hobbled by
strikes for an eleventh day, issued a call to employees to end the
walkout because, he said, it hurts both clients and the company.
	   Louis Gallois, speaking at a news conference, said the 1999
budget of the SNCF foresees stable employee roles for the first
time in 17 years.
	   Gallois said he is not yet in a position to provide personnel
figures, but said that in 1999 there will be for the first time in
17 years ``stability in the number of personnel.''
	   Striking conductors are demanding an additional 600 employees.
	   ``Conductors are demanding more personnel. We have indicated
that in 1999 conductors' jobs will very likely be on the increase
compared to 1998,'' Gallois said, referring to a decision made last
week. No figures have been announced.
	   ``It is time to bring an end to this issue, because the SNCF and
its clients ``are suffering,'' Gallois said.
	   Gallois added that the SNCF foresees a balanced budget in 1999,
after a 1998 deficit likely to exceed the expected 500 million
francs (about dlrs 89 million). The exact figure was not expected
for two months.
	   The Sunday newspaper, Le Journal du Dimanche, reported that the
strike will help inflate 1998 losses to an estimated 700 million
francs (dlrs 125 million).
	   The strike was in effect Monday in 17 out of 23 regions, sparing
the Eurostar to London, the Paris-Brussels route and most Paris
region trains, among others.
	   The issue of job strength was likely to be at the center of a
round table discussion Monday and Tuesday between railroad unions
and officials. The strike, however, is not formally entered into
the agenda of the previously planned ``conference on the
conductors' profession.''

Cyclone Thelma intensifies; Australian city residents warned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ The most severe cyclone since Cyclone
Tracy, which almost wiped out the city of Darwin in 1974, has begun
to slowly move toward the coast of Australia, officials said
Monday.
	   Cyclone Thelma's outer edge was expected to hit the northern
coast of Australia Tuesday afternoon, the Bureau of Meteorology
warned.
	   ``Very destructive'' winds of up to 135 mph (220 kph) were
expected to lash Bathurst and Melville islands, 62 miles (100 km)
north of Darwin, on Tuesday, the bureau said.
	   A 40-year-old office cleaner on Melville Island said she and her
family were listening to the radio and television and were prepared
to evacuate if the cyclone hit.
	   ``It's very bad, the wind and the seas, they are very rough and
the rain she is very strong,'' said the woman, who gave her name
only as Mrs. Woimaenirri.
	   The woman said she still remembered witnessing Cyclone Tracy as
a teen-ager, watching ``trees and tins and tin sheds all flying
around.''
	   Since Cyclone Tracy _ a category four cyclone with winds
measured at 134 mph (217 kph) before measuring instruments broke _
all but destroyed Darwin on Christmas Eve 1974, only four cyclones
have directly hit the city.
	   Cyclone Tracy killed 66 people and damaged 95 percent of
Darwin's houses.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's tiny Liu Xiuhua set a world
record with a snatch of 83.5 kilograms Monday on her way to the
Asian Games gold medal for 48-kilogram division women's
weightlifting.
	   Liu won the gold with a total of 187.5. Myammar's Kay Thi Win
took the silver with 182.5 and Indonesia's Sri Indriyani the bronze
with 180.
	   Liu started with a lift of 80 kilograms in the snatch, and under
the rules, her next lift should have been 2.5 kilograms heavier.
	   She chose instead to go for 83.5 to break the world mark of 83.0
set by China's Li Zhuo on Sept. 16. She succeeded on her second
try.
	   In the total, however, she was credited with only the 82.5 she
was supposed to have tried next.
	   ``I am happy at last even though I should have done better in
clean and jerk,'' she said through an interpreter.
	   Her best at that specialty was 105. She failed at 115.

Philippine Airlines says it needs dlrs 150 million to recover
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Estrada remarks in 7th graf and comment from
lawmaker in 13th-14th grafs.
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Ailing Philippine Airlines said
Monday it needs dlrs 150 million in new capital and a drastic
scaledown of its operations to recover from years of huge financial
losses.
	   PAL submitted a rehabilitation plan Monday to Manila's corporate
watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission, calling for an
injection of capital, a reduction in its workforce, a downsizing of
its fleet, and the abandonment of unprofitable routes.
	   The plan must be approved by the SEC and the airline's local and
foreign creditors, to whom it owes dlrs 2.1 billion.
	   Antonio Ocampo, chairman of a five-man committee that prepared
the plan, said it will provide ``a strong platform for the airline
to recover and become profitable.''
	   PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept. 23 following labor
disputes and mounting losses worsened by Asia's financial crisis.
It then began negotiations with a prospective investor, Cathay
Pacific Airways, but the Hong Kong carrier announced last week it
was pulling out of the talks.
	   President Joseph Estrada said he still hopes he can convince
officials of the two companies to resume negotiations. He said he
is planning to meet PAL and Cathay officials this week.
	   ``I hope we'll be able to settle all these. We won't allow PAL
to close because many would be affected,'' Estrada said, adding he
was against a government bail-out of the carrier.
	   If the proposed rehabilitation plan is approved, local
investors, including PAL chairman and chief stockholder Lucio Tan,
will invest dlrs 90 million of the dlrs 150 million needed by the
airline, PAL said in a statement.
	   The rest would be provided within six months by a still
undetermined ``strategic partner,'' the airline said.
	   Although the talks with Cathay Pacific collapsed, the plan says
PAL should continue seeking a partner, preferably a foreign airline
that could provide capital and management expertise.
	   The 136-page plan also calls for the downsizing of PAL's fleet
from 53 to 22 aircraft, abandonment of unprofitable routes, and a
reduction of workers from 12,986 to 8,589. Some of these have
already been undertaken by PAL.
	   PAL could resume payments to its creditors if the plan is
approved, the airline said. The SEC has allowed the carrier to stop
payments on its debt pending a decision on the survival plan.
	   Joey Salceda, a lawmaker and formerly one of the country's top
financial analysts, said the survival plan will not likely allow
PAL to fully recover due to stiff competition from other
international airlines and the continuing financial difficulties
that dampen businesses worldwide.
	   ``It would buy a little time for PAL, say six months. But that
is only prolonging the agony,'' he said.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed higher Monday,
with key indexes in Hong Kong and Seoul surging nearly 5 percent
after their banks cut interest rates. Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang
Seng Index rose 465.68 points, or 4.7 percent, to close at
10,428.82 on the back of unexpected rate cuts in both Hong Kong and
China and a sharp rebound on Wall Street on Friday. Share prices on
the Seoul Stock Exchange also surged on expected plans by the heads
of the nation's top five conglomerates to sharply pare the number
of affiliates that each controls. The main Korea Composite Stock
Price Index rose 23.81 points, or 4.9 percent, to 514.52. Tokyo's
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 83.52 points, or 0.57
percent, to close at 14,723.49. Meanwhile, the dollar was quoted at
118.96 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.64 yen from late Friday
in Tokyo. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Samsung, South Korea's second-largest
conglomerate, said Monday it would swap its fledgling automobile
subsidiary for Daewoo Group's home appliance businesses. The dlrs
10 billion deal was the highlight of plans announced by the heads
of the nation's top five conglomerates to sharply pare the number
of affiliates that each controls. In all, the Samsung, Hyundai,
Daewoo, LG and SK groups said they would spin off at least 130 of
their 264 subsidiaries in a move to raise some 20 trillion won
(dlrs 16.6 billion). If successful, the sales, mergers and swaps
would let each of the giant groups lower debt levels to twice their
equity by the end of l999. The announcement came after conglomerate
leaders met with President Kim Dae-jung, who has been pressing them
to restructure their bloated, overlapping empires. Analysts
generally hailed the announcement, but some questioned whether the
conglomerates can find buyers for many of their money-losing
affiliates. (SKOREA-CONGLOMERATES)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The battered Russian ruble continued to slip
Monday, heading for a record low since financial crisis hit Russia
in August. The ruble plunged again Monday, closing at 20.4 to the
dollar, down 0.8 from Friday. A team of experts from the World Bank
also arrived in Monday in Moscow to discuss the terms of an earlier
promised dlrs 1.5 billion loan for structural reform, as well as a
dlrs 800 million social reform credit and a dlrs 800 million loan
to streamline the ailing coal industry, the Interfax news agency
reported. The loans are part of an IMF-led dlrs 22.3 billion
bailout package that was agreed upon before economic crisis forced
the government to devalue the ruble and put a 90-day moratorium on
foreign debt Aug. 17. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The world's tallest tower _ if you
count the communications antenna on top _ is to be built in
Melbourne, nudging out Toronto's CN Tower by just over 19 1/2 feet
(six meters). The CN Tower in Toronto, Canada has laid claim to the
world's tallest structure since it was built in 1976 and stands at
1,815 feet (553.3 meters), including its communications antenna.
But under international rules measuring buildings, antennas do not
count toward the height of the building. Purists who spurn antennae
on their skyscrapers consider the 1,483-foot (452-meter) Petronas
Towers in Kuala Lumpur, completed in 1996, the world's tallest
building. Victorian state Premier Jeff Kennett announced Monday
that the Grollo tower concept had won the bid for the Docklands
site on Melbourne's western fringe. The 1,837-foot (560-meter)
obelisk, estimated to cost up to 1.5 billion Australian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 930 million), will include 120 floors of apartments, a
luxury hotel and offices. (AUSTRALIA-TALLEST TOWER)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Nissan Motor Co. and electronics giant
Hitachi Ltd. have agreed to strengthen their ties by jointly
developing advanced technology for cars and auto components, the
companies announced Monday. The cooperation will include developing
technology to create the next generation of environmentally
friendly vehicles and intelligent transport systems, Nissan said in
a statement. The companies hope to produce an automated driving
system sometime after 2000 and also plan to collaborate on
cutting-edge brake systems, the statement said. Japanese media
reported Nissan and Hitachi aim to gain a competitive edge in
advanced car technologies through the arrangement. Many Japanese
automakers have been forming strategic alliances with domestic
rivals and overseas car makers as Japan's recession and economic
woes in Asia push down profits. (JAPAN-HITACHI-NISSAN)

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Six years after leading a bloody coup
attempt, Hugo Chavez rode a wave of fierce public discontent to win
Venezuela's presidency by the largest margin in 40 years. The lower
classes that Chavez championed celebrated wildly in the streets
after Sunday's victory. Across the country, they honked horns, set
off fireworks and shouted ``Chavez! Chavez!'' Many donned the
winner's trademark red beret. Terrified by his fiery populist
rhetoric, Chavez's opponents had branded the cashiered lieutenant
colonel a dictator-in-waiting, poised to impose a socialist regime.
With 78 percent of the votes counted, Chavez had 56.5 percent to
39.5 percent for Salas, according to official results, and turnout
was high for Venezuela at 65 percent. (VENEZUELA-ELECTIONS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Briefly returning to work with a bang, President
Boris Yeltsin fired most of his top aides on Monday during a quick
trip to the Kremlin and assumed personal control of two key
government agencies. After just three hours at his office, Yeltsin
returned to the government hospital where he has been for the past
two weeks where he was being treated for pneumonia, a spokesman
said. The Kremlin shakeup removed several top aides who had
publicly questioned the president's health in recent weeks. Yeltsin
dismissed Chief of Staff Valentin Yumashev and his deputies Yuri
Yarov, Mikhail Komissar and Yevgeny Savostyanov. (RUSSIA-YELTSIN)
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ New satellite images providing the first
close-up views of Mars' north pole show it is a thick ice cap wider
than France but much smaller than previously thought. Planetary
scientists said Sunday that the ice cap revealed by the Mars Global
Surveyor is made of water ice. But even with Mars' very cold
climate, it is only half the size of the ice cap covering Greenland
and only 4 percent of the Antarctica's combined ice sheets. The new
three-dimensional images were discussed at the American Geophysical
Union meeting in San Francisco. The data will be published Friday
in the journal Science. (SCI-US MARS)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In a startling turnaround, a key
witness whose allegations form the bulk of the sex charges against
Malaysia's jailed former No. 2 leader denied Monday that he was
ever sodomized by the ex-deputy prime minister. Azizan Abu Bakar,
who once worked as the driver of former deputy premier Anwar
Ibrahim's wife, now says Anwar did not force him into sodomy, a
crime in this predominantly Muslim nation. Anwar is currently on
trial for four counts of abuse of power. He will be tried later on
another charge of corruption and five charges of committing illegal
sex acts. He has denied any wrongdoing, calling the charges part of
a high-level conspiracy to ruin his political career.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Speeding up a campaign to stamp out a would-be
political opposition party, Chinese authorities will put one of its
leading organizers on trial next week for subversion, a rights
group reported Monday. Court officials in Hangzhou city gave Wang
Youcai's wife an indictment Monday identifying him as a ringleader
of the China Democracy Party and outlining five charges he will
face at trial Dec. 17, the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China reported. The principle charge accuses
Wang of linking up with overseas forces to ``incite the overthrow
of state power'' and is punishable by 10 years to life in prison,
the Hong Kong-based Information Center said. (CHINA-DISSIDENTS)

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japanese swimmer Yasuko Tajima trounced
China's world record holders Chen Yan and Wu Yanyan to claim the
women's 400-meter medley gold medal at the Asian Games Monday.
	   China won the opening two swim golds and was expected to take
the third with event record holder Chen and 200-meter medley record
holder Wu in the field.
	   But Tajima, third behind Chen in the event at this year's world
championships, finished in 4 minutes, 39.92 seconds, well ahead of
Wu (4:46.74) and Chen (4:47.34).
	   Chen set the world record at 4:34.79 last year and backed it up
by winning the world title in Perth in January.
	   She got a poor start in the butterfly Monday and was fourth
after 100 meters but headed into the final 100 meters of freestyle
in second. But Tajima, 17, increased her margin from four seconds
as Chen struggled down the stretch, unable to stop Wu from taking
silver.
	   Dual world championship medalist Shan Ying gave China a good
start to the battle for 32 golds when she powered to victory in the
100-meter freestyle in an outside lane.
	   Shan, who claimed bronze medals in the 50- and 100-meter double
at the Perth world meet earlier this year, was second-slowest
qualifier for the final and had to win from Lane 1.
	   She turned in front at 50 meters and finished in 56.20 seconds.
China's Chao Na and Japan's Sumika Minamoto, the fastest qualifier,
had a dead heat for silver in 56.39 seconds.
	   China is returning to the Asian Games four years after a drugs
scandal in Hiroshima, Japan. China won a remarkable 25 of 32 golds
in 1994 but seven of its swim team and 11 athletes overall were
found later to have used steroids. China also dominated its home
games in Beijing in 1990 with 20 golds.
	   After six team members were sent home in disgrace from the Perth
meet, China has claimed its team is free of drugs for this event.
All swimmers were tested before leaving for Bangkok, according to
Chinese press reports. Medley swimmer Xiong Guoming is back after
he was one of the seven who returned a positive test in Hiroshima.
	   China was on an early path to another Asian Games triumph as
Zeng Qiliang followed Shan's win with victory in the men's
100-meter breaststroke.
	   Zeng, who won the silver medal at the Perth world championships
behind Olympic champion Frederick Deburghgraeve of Belgium,
outclassed his rivals Monday. He finished in 1 minute, 2.32 seconds
for a comfortable win over Japan's Akira Hayashi (1:02.55) and
Malaysia's Elvin Chia (1:03.09).

Canadian minister at opening of new Budapest airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Transport Minister David Collenette of
Canada and his Hungarian counterpart Kalman Katona inaugurated a
new airport facility Monday, marking Canada's biggest investment in
this former communist country.
	   The prime contractor for building Ferihegy 2B was the Canadian
Commercial Corporation, a government agency, and the work was
executed by the Aiport Development Corp. of Toronto, best known for
their work on Pearson International.
	   The Royal Bank of Canada was the leading financial backer of the
dlrs 120 million (Canadian) project.
	   The new airport, designed to handle up to five million
passengers annually, will start operations Dec. 12, taking over the
function of the old airport which will be closed for a major
facelift.
	   ``This will be an excellent reflection of Hungary's modern,
dynamic image,'' Collenette said.
	   The two ministers signed a bilateral Air Transport Agreement,
which will allow a direct air link between the two countries
starting next spring.

European group SEMA replaces IBM as Olympic technology provider
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The IOC on Monday appointed the
little-known European computer group Sema as the chief Olympic
information and technology sponsor for 2001 to 2008.
	   The French-English company will take over from U.S. giant IBM,
which ends its 38-year partnership with the International Olympic
Committee at the 2000 Sydney Games.
	   The IOC described the eight-year deal with Sema as the biggest
sports-related information technology contract ever awarded. While
the IOC decline to disclose figures, the deal is believed to be
worth around dlrs 220 million.
	   Sema will head a consortium of three companies in the IOC's new
Olympic Information Technology Group. The companies will provide
the computer technology and results systems for the summer games of
2004 and 2008 and winter games of 2002 and 2006.
	   The Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in 2002 will be the first
games operating under the new technology arrangement.
	   Under the deal, Sema will become a partner in the IOC's TOP
corporate sponsorship program starting Jan. 1, 2000. TOP sponsors
pay around dlrs 40 million for exclusive Olympic advertising
rights.
	   The IOC said Sema will provide the systems integration,
operations management and applications delivery for the Olympics.
The company will also help develop the IOC's Internet sites.
	   IOC marketing director Michael Payne said the partners for venue
results management and for computer hardware will be announced in
early 1999. The Swiss watchmaker Swatch is favored to win the
results contract, with Compaq and Sun Microsystems in the running
for the hardware deal.
	   Payne said the three companies will contribute around dlrs 500
million in cash and value-in-kind services to the games as part of
their partnership, with the IOC and organizing committees putting
up around dlrs 200 million for the installation and maintenance of
the new system.
	   The contract with Sema will be signed Saturday in Lausanne by
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and Sema chief executive
officer Pierre Bonelli.
	   Payne said Sema was chosen ahead of several other companies,
including EDS and Arthur Andersen.
	   Sema is a relatively anonymous European computer services and
defense technology firm employing 16,500 people. The high-profile
tie-in with the Olympics should put the company on the world map.
	   Sema provided information systems at the 1992 Barcelona Games
and has been involved in other sports events such as the 1994 World
Cup, the 1996 European Soccer Championship and the 1998
Commonwealth Games.
	   ``It's not a very well known brand name but they come to the
table with a tremendous amount of knowledge and understanding,''
Payne said. ``The IOC's primary decision was to ensure we had the
best technology solution and to create as risk-free a scenario as
possible.''
	   IBM was roundly criticized for failures in the computer results
system at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
	   The IOC and IBM parted ways in an acrimonious split earlier this
year when negotiations broke down over a new eight-year deal.
	   The IOC said IBM's demands to be paid hundreds of millions of
dollars for its services would bankrupt organizing committees in
Salt Lake and other host cities. IBM wanted local Olympic
organizing committees to share the technology costs.
	   IBM executives were upset by an IOC decision to seek a more
profitable sponsorship deal for internet services and sites at
upcoming games, a role IBM held in the past two Olympics, at Nagano
and Atlanta.

Russia, Iraq claim sanctions against Baghdad could be lifted soon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Iraq's Tariq Aziz and Russia's foreign minister
said Monday that the Arab nation was again cooperating with U.N
weapons inspectors and that sanctions relief should be granted
soon.
	   Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, maintains regular ties with
Russia, which is sympathetic to Baghdad and supports the early
lifting of the comprehensive U.N. sanctions.
	   ``We believe that soon the sanctions will be lifted,'' Russia's
Foreign Minister Ivan Ivanov told a news conference after meeting
Aziz. ``We are approaching the end of a long process.''
	   Despite Ivanov's optimism, there are no signs that the United
States and Britain, the leading proponents of sanctions, are
prepared to ease their stance following repeated showdowns with
Iraq.
	   Iraq agreed to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors
last month after a confrontation that nearly led to military
strikes by the United States.
	   Aziz said he hoped that ``lawful and objective inspections''
could take place next month. And he again criticized the U.N.
Security Council for failing to end the embargo that was placed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``For more than seven years Iraq has been following through on
its obligations, but the Security Council hasn't been meeting its
obligations,'' Aziz said. ``This is unacceptable.''
	   While offering Iraq moral support, Russia has insisted that
Baghdad comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 687, which
calls for the dismantling of all weapons of mass destruction, the
main condition for ending the sanctions.
	   ``We are calling for the full implementation ... which should
lead to the lifting of the oil embargo,'' Ivanov said.
	   Aziz was to meet Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov later
on Monday.
	   Primakov, a fluent Arabic speaker who has known Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein for years, has mediated on several occasions when
Iraq and the United Nations were in the midst of a confrontation.
	   Iraq wants the embargo lifted so it can resume exporting oil at
full capacity and rebuild its shattered economy. It is permitted
limited oil exports at present to buy food and medicine.
	   Russia, meanwhile, is owed billions of dollars by Iraq and wants
to help rebuild the country's oil industry when the sanctions are
lifted.
	   However, world oil prices are already sagging due to an oil
glut, and if Iraq increased its exports it could push prices even
lower.

Ex-communists seeks amnesty for guards, others convicted in unified
</HEADLINE>
Germany &QL; 
 &UR; By THOMAS SCHMOLL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's main governing and opposition parties
united Monday against calls by ex-communists to grant amnesty to
former East German officials convicted of such crimes as killing
citizens as they tried to flee the communist state.
	   Such an amnesty would demonstrate disrespect for former East
German activists whose peaceful demonstrations led to the fall of
the Berlin Wall in 1989, Volker Beck, a Greens legal expert, was
quoted Monday as saying in the Berliner Morgenpost.
	   As part of a proposed amnesty law, an ex-communist Party of
Democratic Socialism lawmaker, Evelyn Kenzler, has called for
compensation payments of 600 marks (dlrs 350) for every month that
former East German soldiers, border guards and officials serve in
German jails.
	   The party has long argued against trying officials and the
rank-and-file for enforcing what was then East German law,
including the shoot-to-kill orders on the border. The federal
Constitutional Court, Germany's nation's highest, ruled in 1996
that the trials legal because Wall shootings violated human rights.
	   To date, some 80 trials of border guards and former leaders have
produced hundreds of convictions on charges relating to shootings
at the border with West Germany. Authorities say up to 1,000 East
Germans died trying to flee to the West during the nearly 30 years
of the Wall.
	   PDS parliamentary leader, Gregor Gysi, on Monday said amnesty
would help foster reconciliation between eastern and western
Germany, but that it should only apply to those who were acting
under orders.
	   ``A soldier who shot at someone trying to flee who had already
surrendered would also have been guilty under East German law,''
Gysi said in a telephone interview.
	   Such a law, however, appeared unlikely to get anywhere, with
both governing parties, the Social Democrats and the Greens, as
well as the opposition Christian Democrats and the Free Democrats
swiftly denouncing the idea.
	   The Social Democrats said the proposal showed a ``contempt for
basic law.''
	   The proposal only hardened suspicions by some that the party has
not fully embraced democracy. ``The PDS is and remains a wolf in
sheep's clothing,'' said Free Democratic vice chairwoman Cornelia
Pieper.

Impeachment commission says Yeltsin not guilty of destroying
</HEADLINE>
military &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A parliamentary commission seeking to impeach
Russian President Boris Yeltsin decided Monday he was not directly
responsible for the collapse of the country's military, a news
report said.
	   Lawmakers had accused Yeltsin of underfunding the armed forces,
which don't have the money to maintain equipment, modernize
technology or properly train soldiers because of the country's
economic problems.
	   Commission members had said throughout the proceedings that they
probably would not be able to prove that Yeltsin purposely sought
to destroy the military, and as a result, his role in its collapse
would not constitute an impeachable offense.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin, who has been hospitalized with pneumonia
over the last two weeks, surfaced briefly at the Kremlin on Monday
to fire his chief of staff and other aides. He then returned to the
hospital.
	   The commission, which is drawing up articles of impeachment, has
already said Yeltsin committed three impeachable offenses:
instigating the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, illegally
sending troops and tanks against his foes in the previous
parliament in 1993, and launching the unsuccessful war in
separatist Chechnya.
	   Any impeachment motion is unlikely to remove Yeltsin. It would
need a two-thirds majority in the upper and lower houses of
parliament, as well as approval by the pro-Yeltsin Constitutional
and Supreme Courts.
	   The impeachment commission will meet in mid-December to discuss
the fifth and final impeachment article, which accuses Yeltsin of
genocide, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The commission will try to determine whether Yeltsin was
responsible for a deterioration in Russia's living standards since
the Soviet Union fell that includes a greater incidence of disease
and a lower birth-rate and life expectancy, Commission Chairman
Vadim Filimonov told ITAR-Tass.

Britain helps out Malaysians studying at U.K. universities

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Britain granted financial
assistance totaling 1.6 million ringgit (dlrs 400,000) to the
Malaysian Trust Council for use in sponsoring 102 Malaysian
students' studies in Britain, a news report said Monday.
	   British High Commissioner (ambassador) Graham Fry formally
presented a check for the aid, saying his country was the first to
extend help to Malaysian students facing financial difficulties
arising from the current economic downturn in the Southeast Asian
country, state-run Bernama news agency reported.
	   There are about 1,700 Malaysian Trust Council-sponsored students
studying abroad in Britain this year.
	   The aid money will allow several students who had planned to
cancel their stay in Britain to continue studying there, the report
said.

NATO parliamentarians meets Egyptian officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Legislators from NATO and Egypt opened a
three-day meeting Monday aimed at promoting cooperation in issues
including terrorism and the elimination of nuclear weapons in the
Middle East.
	   The seminar was the first by a special committee of the North
Atlantic Assembly, the alliance's parliamentary arm, held outside
its headquarters. The committee deals with Mediterranean non-NATO
states.
	   The legislators will discuss Egypt's concerns about terrorism,
nuclear weapons, the Middle East peace process, the migration of
labor and economic development.
	   At the opening session, Egyptian Parliament Speaker Fathy Serour
urged the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to
increase cooperation in preventing terrorism and to stop offering
political asylum to terrorists.
	   Serour also complained about the West's passiveness toward
Israel's possession of a nuclear arsenal, which he said threatened
regional security.
	   He called on NATO members to deal with ``the problem of mass
destructive weapons with one scale'' _ a reference to the greater
attention paid to Iraq's weaponry than to Israel's nuclear
capabilites.
	   Serour also urged the NATO countries to help push forward the
Middle East peace process and to start an economic partnership that
would bring more investment to Egypt. He also asked that the rights
of laborers who migrated legally to NATO countries be protected.
	   Legislators from other Mediterranean countries including Israel,
Jordan and the Palestinians also attended the meeting.
	   The seminar's conclusions will be issued Tuesday, though it
formally closes Wednesday.

Parliament to pass law granting privileges for state officials

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Set to tighten their grip on power,
Serbian lawmakers met Monday to pass a law granting state officials
lifelong privileges, including high salaries, paid servants and
security.
	   The law, drafted by supporters of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, has been criticized by opposition parties and
independent media since it comes amid worsening economic situation
in the country.
	   Despite fierce criticism, the law is expected to be passed by
the deputies from Milosevic's Socialist Party and allied
ultranationalists and neo-Communists.
	   The 250-seat assembly will also adopt the 1999 budget and a
series of measures imposing enormous taxes for various utilities,
including private cars, mobile phones and weapons.
	   The cash-strapped government is hoping to accumulate some 6
billion dinars (dlrs 600,000) by the move, reported Belgrade VIP
news digest.
	   The laws are certain to put further financial strain on Serbia's
impoverished citizens with the country's average salary about dlrs
50 and unemployment reaching some 50 percent.
	   Despite growing poverty, Milosevic and his government have so
far faced little unrest. The workers have avoided street protests
led by the opposition. Critics accuse Milosevic and his aides of
accumulating wealth while destroying Serbia's economy in the past
decade of their rule.
	   In his opening speech, Premier Mirko Marjanovic praised
government achievements in the past year, blaming the hardship on
international isolation of Serbia and the additional costs to
finance police crackdown in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian rebels
have been fighting for independence.
	   One fourth of the 1999 budget, or 21.5 billion dinars (dlrs 2.1
billion), will go to financing police, the main pillar of
Milosevic's decade-long rule in Serbia. The rest will go to social
programs, education and other costs.
	   Under the law on ``the rights and obligations'' of the state
officials, such people as the president, parliament speaker, prime
minister and others will receive salaries 10 to 20 times the
national average.
	   The president of Serbia will enjoy benefits such as a special
residence provided by the government. He will travel free of charge
and have lifelong pension worth 85 percent of the salary as active
president.
	   After his mandate expires, the president will be granted three
paid servants, a car and an administrative clerk. His wife also
will enjoy benefits.
	   Other Serbian officials would have similar privileges, which
also include personal bodyguards for the official, his family and
house. The law is likely to be implemented retroactively, for the
period since 1990 when Milosevic was president of Serbia.
	   Milosevic became president of Yugoslavia, which includes Serbia
and Montenegro, in July 1997.
	   ``There is no end to the arrogance and greed of the authorities,
and their cruel scoffing of millions of impoverished citizens,''
the opposition Serb Democratic Party said in a statement. ``The law
... is really a law on enriching the state officials.''

Yeltsin fires key aides during a brief visit from hospital

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Briefly returning to work with a bang, President
Boris Yeltsin fired most of his top aides on Monday and assumed
personal control of two key government agencies during a surprise
foray into the Kremlin.
	   After just three hours at his office, Yeltsin returned to the
government hospital where he has been for the past two weeks. The
Kremlin shakeup removed several top aides who had publicly
questioned the president's health in recent weeks.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin was quoted by
presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin as telling the stupefied
aides.
	   The president will remain in the hospital as long as necessary
to fully recuperate from pneumonia, Yakushkin said. He refused to
say when Yeltsin will be released, adding that it would depend on
the treatment.
	   Yeltsin dismissed Chief of Staff Valentin Yumashev and his
deputies Yuri Yarov, Mikhail Komissar and Yevgeny Savostyanov.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff, while the
other posts remain vacant. Bordyuzha, who will serve in both posts,
was chief of the Border Guards before his appointment to the
security post earlier this year.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin had dismissed the aides because of their
failure to stem crime or respond to several incidents of political
extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist deputy in
the Russian parliament.
	   ``That undermines confidence in the president and in the
government as a whole, and that is inadmissible in the current
difficult economic situation,'' the spokesman said.
	   Yeltsin has a habit of unexpected and often unexplained
dismissals. The latest round of ousters was also thought to reflect
his unhappiness over the aides' unusual candidness about his health
in recent weeks.
	   Yumashev and other Kremlin aides openly said that Yeltsin is too
weak to handle day-to-day affairs or to make foreign trips and
suggested he leave control of the economy and other current affairs
to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   The Russian media has said that the passive and defeatist aides
were further eroding Yeltsin's power. The dismissed aides handled
the workings of the Kremlin and the president's routine and had
considerable influence.
	   ``The president wanted to show who is the boss,'' Alexander
Shokhin, the head of the moderate, pro-government Our Home Is
Russia parliament faction, told reporters. ``He's like a lion who
licked his wounds and now roared at those who thought he was
already out of the game.''
	   Ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky praised the president for
cleaning the Kremlin of what he described as corrupt, weak
``slime,'' while Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov added his support.
	   Communists have long assailed the aides fired by Yeltsin, but
their No. 2, Valentin Kuptsov, criticized Yeltsin anyway. ``After
every illness or holiday of the president we always expect
inexplicable personnel reshuffling,'' he said.
	   In his brief flurry of activity, Yeltsin also said he would
begin overseeing the justice ministry and tax police _ without
replacing the actual heads. The move is aimed at stepping up fight
against endemic corruption and other crime, Yakushkin said.
	   A top democratic lawmaker, Galina Starovoitova, was murdered
last month in St. Petersburg in an apparent contract killing. Her
unexplained death outraged and shocked many Russian politicians and
ordinary people.
	   Yakushkin denied that the move reflected Yeltsin's
dissatisfaction with Primakov's handling of the agencies, saying it
was intended to simply streamline the government. ``In the current
situation, the government must be like one fist,'' he added.
	   Yeltsin all but disappeared from sight when he entered a
government hospital Nov. 22 with pneumonia, the latest in a long
string of health problems in recent years for the Russian leader.
	   Many of Yeltsin's opponents claim he hasn't been seriously
involved in national affairs for a long time and is no longer fit
to lead.
	   Despite calls for his resignation, Yeltsin and his doctors
insist that the president will serve out his term, which ends in
2000.
	   Also Monday, Yeltsin replaced the head of a government
communications agency and set up a panel intended to streamline
Russia's arms trade.

China's men defend Asian Games gymnastics title

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's male gymnasts eclipsed the
competition from South Korea and Japan on Monday in defending their
team title at the Asian Games, opening what threatens to be another
Chinese takeover of the gymnastics competition.
	   A jubilant South Korea won a tight contest with Japan for
silver, defending its runner-up title from the last Asian Games in
Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994.
	   Theirs was a fascinating duel. Japan led South Korea after the
first discipline by more than half a point. But South Korea clawed
its way back with a strong showing in the vault, its second
discipline, only to drop back later in the competition.
	   The South Koreans went into the last round trailing the Japanese
by close to half a point. But minutes later, with a strong showing
on the pommel horse while Japan stumbled on the floor, they had
fought their way back again to secure the silver with 225.750
points to 225.375 for Japan, once again the bronze medalist.
	   China's team of veterans and newcomers led from its opening
discipline, the vault. Showing greater power, speed, strength,
consistency and technique than the other teams, the Chinese
finished with 230.200 points, nearly a five-point cushion over the
second-place Koreans.
	   The team competition will be used to select qualifiers for the
all-around and individual events.
	   The competitions to find the best all-around men and women
gymnasts take place Wednesday, with the individual apparatus
championships the next day.
	   China will be looking for a clean sweep of the team titles when
its powerful squad of diminutive teen-age girls battles to retain
the women's team title Tuesday.
	   The team includes four veterans of the squad that captured
bronze at last year's World Championships and two relative
newcomers, including 16-year-old Xu Jing from Beijing, who stands
just 1.43 meters (4 feet, 8 1/4 inches) tall and weighs just 35
kilograms (77 pounds).
	   China's women swept all the gold at Hiroshima, led by gymnast Mo
Huilan, who swept all four individual apparatus titles.
	   Team coach Qian Kui said the squad had no one of Mo's quality
and replied, ``It's very hard so say,'' when asked whether China's
women were expected to sweep again.
	   The team veterans include Kui Yuanyuan, who won a World
Championship gold in 1996 on the floor, and bronze on balance beam
at the 1997 worlds; Meng Fei, silver medalist on the uneven bars at
last year's worlds; Liu Xuan, a beam bronze medalist at the 1996
worlds and a gold medal winner, again on beam, at this year's World
Cup in Sabae, Japan; and 17-year-old Bi Wenjing, who got bronze on
the uneven bars at the 1997 worlds and a gold in the same event at
the World Cup.

Clashes over prisoners continue; hunger strikes expands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANA BUDEIRI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Clashes over the release of
Palestinian prisoners spread throughout the West Bank Monday, and a
prisoners' group said its hunger strike would continue until Israel
releases all its Palestinian prisoners.
	   The Palestinian Prisoners Association urged Palestinians to
stage an ``intefadeh'' _ or uprising _ until all Palestinian
prisoners are released, Palestinian legislator Fares Kadoura told
protesters in the Palestinian-controlled town of Ramallah.
	   ``The Palestinians in Israeli jails announce that our revolution
has started,'' Kadoura said, reading from a statement.
	   Israel released 250 Palestinian prisoners last month out of 750
promised it the U.S.-brokered Wye River accords, signed in October.
	   Palestinians are angry that most of those released were accused
of common crimes and want Israel to release ``security prisoners''
_ those detained without trial under prevention of terror measures.
	   Kadoura, who is a member of the team negotiating the prisoners
release with Israel, said that a hunger strike begun last week by
hundreds of prisoners had now spread to all four Israeli jails and
among all 3,000 Palestinian prisoners.
	   Prisons Authority spokeswoman Orit Messer-Harel said she knew of
only 514 prisoners striking at two prisons since Friday. There had
been no health problems so far, she said.
	   Israel would not heed the protests, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said.
	   ``They want to impose on Israel to release murderers,'' he said
on a tour of an archaeological dig in Jerusalem's Old City. ``I
don't free murderers.''
	   He did not address demands for the release of others not accused
of being involved in killings, including members of banned militant
groups.
	   In recent weeks, Israel and the Palestinians have accused one
another of failing to live up to various provisions, and Israel has
threatened to hold off on a scheduled Dec. 18 troop pullback. That
could poison next week's planned visit to the region.
	   Clashes took place in at least five West Bank locations,
including some controlled by the Palestinian Authority. Most
injuries were minor.
	   Stone-throwing protesters ambushed Israeli vehicles in Abu Dis,
a village east of Jerusalem. One Israeli in a pick-up truck fired
on the protesters, wounding one of them in the thigh.
	   The driver of the pick-up truck said his passenger _ whom he
would not identify _ opened fire because they felt their lives were
in danger.
	   ``Suddenly 100-200 Arabs with big stones surrounded us around
the car,'' the driver, who would only give his name as Michael,
told Associated Press Television. ``They want to kill us.''
	   The wounded Palestinian was later listed in moderate condition
in hospital.
	   In the city of Nablus in the northern West Bank, 200 Palestinian
riot police clashed with about 3,000 protesters demanding that the
Authority increase pressure on Israel to release the prisoners.
	   One prisoner's mother, Jazer Hamami, accused the Palestinian
police of being more brutal than the Israelis.
	   ``When the Israeli soldiers were here, none of them beat
women,'' she said.

French magistrate questions Kurdish leader in Rome
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Kurdish rebel leader detained in Rome was
questioned Monday by a French magistrate investigating extortion
attempts against Kurdish residents in France.
	   The magistrate flew to Rome to interrogate Abdullah Ocalan, who
heads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has been fighting
for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
	   The Italian news agency ANSA said the French magistrate was
investigating efforts by the PKK to shake down Kurds in France.
	   Ocalan has been detained in Italy since arriving from Moscow
Nov. 12. Turkey, which considers him a terrorist responsible for
thousands of deaths, has demanded his extradition, but Italy has
refused because he could face the death penalty.
	   Germany has also issued warrants for Ocalan on terrorist
charges, but has declined to seek his extradition fearing it could
cause unrest in the country's 2-million-strong Turkish community.
	   Italy is now seeking support from its European allies for some
sort of international tribunal to try him.

Ukrainian opposition activists protest Swiss arrest of their

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Dozens of Ukrainian opposition party
activists and lawmakers demonstrated Monday near the Swiss Embassy
in Kiev to protest the arrest of their leader in Switzerland on
money-laundering charges.
	   The protesters, from the centrist Hromada movement, held
placards that read: ``Hands off the leader of Hromada!'' and
``Switzerland, stop playing political games!''
	   Hromada chief and former Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko, 45, who
is now a lawmaker in the Ukrainian parliament, was detained last
Wednesday as he drove from France into Switzerland. Swiss
authorities charged him in a money-laundering scheme on Friday.
	   According to investigating Judge Laurent Kasper-Ansermet, a
``relatively large'' sum of money had been seized in Geneva in
connection with the charges against Lazarenko.
	   Last month, Swiss federal police announced that Switzerland was
helping Ukrainian authorities track down money Lazarenko allegedly
stashed in Swiss banks. Switzerland has handed over some bank
documents to Ukraine, and investigations are underway in several
Swiss states.
	   Ukrainian authorities are already investigating whether
Lazarenko and other Hromada leaders have been involved in
corruption.
	   Lazarenko was prime minister from 1996 to 1997, and was
dismissed by President Leonid Kuchma. Critics say Lazarenko reaped
huge profits from the distribution of natural gas supplies in the
former Soviet republic when he served as prime minister, but he and
his allies deny the charges.
	   Lazarenko says the authorities want to discredit him before
presidential elections in October 1999, and he has even accused
Kuchma's close entourage of plotting to kill him.
	   Lazarenko's party fared well in parliamentary elections this
year and he was widely considered a top contender in the future
presidential race. His arrest appears to deal his chances a severe
blow.
	   Several Hromada legislators from among Monday's protesters met
with the Swiss ambassador, presenting the embassy with a letter
that said Lazarenko's arrest was a ``planned action of reprisal
against a politician whose party is in the opposition,'' the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Lazarenko's initial term of arrest is eight days. A hearing is
expected this week and Kasper-Ansermet, the judge, has said he
would ask to detain the Ukrainian politician until trial.
	   An investigator from Switzerland was expected to arrive in
Ukraine Monday for meetings with his Ukrainian counterparts
investigating Lazarenko's case, said Tetiana Zadorozhna, one of the
protesting legislators.

Baby delivered on train station platform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ A baby was delivered on a crowded train
platform in suburban Bombay as loads of coomunters gingerly stepped
around a group that gathered to help the mother, a local newspaper
reported Monday.
	   First aid was given to the woman after she delivered a healthy
baby boy Friday and she was later admitted to a hospital, Bandra
station master Karegar confirmed Monday.
	   Ammaji Varli, 28, was on the way to the hospital with her
husband when labor pains forced her to disembark at Bandra. Women
commuters rushed to cover Varli with their shawls to shield her
from the rush of harried commuters, Mid-Day newspaper reported.
	   A nurse who alighted at the same station took charge, while a
beautician, also on the platform, provided the scissors needed to
cut the umbilical cord after a tea stall owned dipped them in
boiling water.
	   ``Though this is my third child, it is a morning I will never
forget .... I wish I could know who the people were who helped me
out,'' Varli told the newspaper.
	   The mother and son were discharged from the hospital Monday.

SAfrica's National Party challenges voter rules in court
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The National Party that until
1994 denied nonwhites the right to vote on Monday filed a court
challenge against voters registration rules, saying they favor the
ruling party.
	   The party is asking the Cape High Court to declare
unconstitutional a requirement that all voters must have a
bar-coded identity document in order to register to vote in next
year's elections.
	   ``No law of Parliament can come along and prescribe an
administrative procedure which has the effect of disenfranchising
millions,'' said party leader Marthinus van Schalkwyk. ``This
amounts to gerrymandering.''
	   Bar-coded identification books were first introduced in 1986.
But only about 65 percent of whites, the bulwark support of
opposition parties, have the proper documents, compared to 80
percent of blacks.
	   Many blacks rushed to obtain the new papers to replace their
apartheid-era documents after white rule started disintegrating in
1990. Many whites carry pre-1986 documents that have no expiration
date.
	   The court was expected to hear the case on Thursday, said Jan
Bosman, spokesman for the National Party that governed during
decades of white minority rule.
	   Another opposition party, the tiny mostly white Democratic
Party, also plans to challenge the process in court in Pretoria on
Wednesday.
	   In the country's first all-race elections in 1994, which marked
the end of apartheid and swept the African National Congress to
power, people simply had to show up at any polling station and
produce any identity document.
	   The creation of a national voters roll, which also requires
voters to register at specific stations, is seen as a maturing of
South Africa's fledgling democracy.
	   But it got off to a shaky start over the past ten days. Initial
plans to register 24.7 million voters over one three-day weekend at
the end of November were changed in the face of administrative and
funding problems.
	   Extra civil servants and soldiers were drafted to help register
voters, and registration in half of the country was delayed until
this past weekend.
	   The Independent Electoral Commission also plans to add more days
to register in the New Year.
	   By Monday morning, about 6.3 million names were recorded in
computerized voter rolls, with an additional three million
registrations expected from outlying districts.
	   No date has been set for the election, expected to be sometime
after May 1.

Rivalry between World Cup co-hosts evident in Korea-Japan match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHN SUN JOO &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ When it comes to history, Korea and
Japan have plenty of the bitter kind they need to put behind them
to serve as co-hosts for soccer's World Cup in 2002.
	   On Monday, they nearly _ but not quite _ succeeded during South
Korea's 2-0 victory in a second-round Asian Games opener.
	   The large South Korean and Japanese expatriate communities in
Bangkok turned out to support their sides, but the Koreans were
better prepared, clad in uniforms, banging gongs and drums and
waving flags.
	   They split into three main groups to cover all sides of the
stadium, drowning out any cheers that the Japanese might have
tried.
	   ``Although you can see some Koreans saying, `Japan, go to hell'
when they see Japanese crowds waving their flags, I don't think
it's because of ill feelings,'' summed up Lee Yong-chan, 35, a
Korean businessman.
	   ``It's more of a competitive feeling toward an opponent,'' Lee
said.
	   The Koreans expressed confidence they would win _ and they did,
off star striker Choi Yong-soo's two goals. They said to a man that
they harbored no ill feelings toward Japan, which brutally
colonized their country between 1910 and 1945.
	   Relations between the countries have often been strained since
the end of World War II, though the passions have cooled somewhat
as the wartime generation passes on.
	   Most in the crowd Monday were youngsters. For them, the prospect
of being co-hosts for a World Cup in four years sparks deeper
feeling than bad will toward Japan.
	   Monday's game was just another soccer match _ and the desire to
win, against whomever, was total.
	   ``We have to win,'' said Kim Seung-joo, 25, a student. ``I don't
have ill feelings toward Japan. I just want the Korean team to do
their best.''
	   Businessman Lee was worried that the Asian economic crisis,
which has hit South Korea especially hard, would undermine the Cup.
	   Thailand, another recession-hit country, was barely able to
organize the Asian Games, an Olympic-style event bringing together
6,000 athletes from 41 countries.
	   ``I think it's going to be like this Asian Games _ we won't be
ready,'' Lee said. ``You can't get anything without investment, yet
that's exactly what we're trying to do.''

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ For the second day in a row,
astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour on Friday for liftoff on
NASA's first space station construction flight.
	   ``Let's go do this,'' said commander Robert Cabana.
	   ``Amen,'' replied a launch controller.
	   Rain and cloudy skies were once again a threat. But NASA was
confident the master alarm in Endeavour's cockpit would behave; it
went off with just 4{ minutes to go in the countdown Thursday,
forcing a delay.
	   NASA has only five minutes or less each day to launch Endeavour
in order to meet up with the first space station part, which was
put in orbit two weeks ago by the Russians. The shuttle contains
the second station component.
	   The master alarm blared and red lights flashed just before the
shuttle was to lift off early Thursday. By the time controllers
traced the problem to a momentary drop in hydraulic pressure and
decided to press ahead, it was too late _ they had missed the
cutoff by a second or two.
	   ``Sure, it's frustrating,'' said Bill Readdy, shuttle program
director and a veteran shuttle commander. ``But we do things right.
We do things by the book, and we're not going to cut any corners
even if it means just shaving a second or two.''
	   The six astronauts crawled out of the shuttle, and two threw up
their hands. Cabana held up his thumb and index finger a half-inch
apart: ``We were that close.''
	   The problem was confined to one of Endeavour's three hydraulic
pressure units. The pressure dropped just long enough to trigger
the alarm, evidently because of a sensitive switch, then returned
to normal. NASA engineers spent the day examining the problem, but
found nothing wrong with any of the systems and were confident it
would not reoccur.
	   Endeavour's flight is already a year late because of a cash
crunch in Russia, one of NASA's partners in building the
international space station. The one-day delay cost NASA about
$600,000, mostly in fuel and overtime pay.
	   Aboard Endeavour is an American-made connecting passageway named
Unity. The astronauts will use the shuttle robot arm to capture the
Russian space station piece and attach it to Unity. Then, two
spacewalkers will hook up all the electrical connections and cables
between the two cylinders, and attach handrails and tools for
future crews.
	   Until the alarm sounded, it looked as though the weather would
be the only problem. Rain and clouds moved in from the Atlantic 1{
hours before liftoff, but drifted away with minutes to spare.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other dignitaries from
around the world had gathered in the drizzle to see Endeavour and
its crew off.
	   ``Here we have 16 countries cooperating on a venture to the
future,'' said Albright, who was expected back for Friday's
attempt. ``This is a good investment.''

Turkmenistan suspends death penalty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Turkmenistan has declared a moratorium on the
death penalty, a news agency reported, making it the latest former
Soviet republic to eliminate execution.
	   Turkmenistan Foreign Minister Boris Shikhmuradov revealed the
decision Thursday at a conference of Europe's security and human
rights watchdog, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, in Oslo, Norway, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Turkmenistan may still hand down death sentences until the death
penalty is formally repealed, Shikhmuradov said. In the meantime,
no prisoners in this impoverished central Asian nation will be
executed.
	   Russia also declared a moratorium on the death penalty in 1996,
but its efforts to formally outlaw it have been stymied by the
opposition-dominated parliament. Ukraine, Azerbaijan and other
ex-Soviet states also have suspended it.
	   The OSCE is opening an office in Turkmenistan early next year.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ All 18 crew members of a Russian fishing vessel
were rescued Friday after their boat sank in freezing waters off
the eastern island of Sakhalin, a news report said.
	   The Sputnik fishing boat was covered with a thick layer of ice,
and that apparently contributed to its sinking, said Konstantin
Sviridov, the duty captain at the Vladivostok maritime rescue
center.
	   The crew members were picked up by other Russian boats fishing
in the area and taken Sakhalin's southwest port of Nevelsk, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

<TEXT>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Space shuttle Endeavour and a crew
of six blasted off Friday on NASA's first space station
construction flight, lighting up the pre-dawn sky on their way to
orbit.
	   It was the second launch attempt in as many days.
	   ``Let's go do this,'' said commander Robert Cabana.
	   ``Amen,'' replied a launch controller.
	   This time, the master alarm in Endeavour's cockpit behaved. It
went off with just 4{ minutes remaining in Thursday's countdown,
forcing a delay. The weather also cooperated, despite forecasters'
earlier call for rain.
	   Columbia lifted off at 3:35 a.m. with the second component of
the international space station just seconds after the first part,
placed in orbit two weeks ago by the Russians, soared over Cape
Canaveral. The full moon gleamed as the chase began.
	   The shuttle, which reached orbit after a smooth 8-minute ride,
is to meet up with the Russian component on Sunday.
	   On Thursday, the master alarm blared and red lights flashed just
before the shuttle was to lift off. By the time controllers traced
the problem to a momentary drop in hydraulic pressure and decided
to press ahead, it was too late _ they had missed the cutoff by a
second or two.
	   ``Sure, it's frustrating,'' said Bill Readdy, shuttle program

Five Americans, one Russian on first construction mission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AM-PM-Space Station &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Five Americans and one Russian are on NASA's first
station-construction flight. A brief look at each:
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Commander Robert Cabana has wanted to help build a space station
ever since he joined NASA in 1985.
	   NASA's target date, back then, was 1992. ``This is a chance to
finally get started,'' he says.
	   Cabana, 49, a Minneapolis-born Marine colonel and former test
pilot, became captivated with flying at age 5. His family took him
to the Smithsonian to see the planes of the Wright brothers and
Charles Lindbergh, and ``it's something that just stuck with me.''
	   This is his fourth space flight. Between his third and fourth
missions, he served as chief of the astronaut corps.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Pilot Rick Sturckow gave up race car driving to become a pilot
and, ultimately, an astronaut.
	   The space rookie from Lakeside, Calif., drove a Camaro in
stock-car races throughout his home state before joining the
Marines in 1984. NASA tapped him 10 years later.
	   ``Yeah, I've jumped in a race car every once in a while just to
kind of get the blood pumping,'' says the 37-year-old major. ``We
still fly high-performance jets, the T-38s. It's not the greatest
thing in the world, but you know it's not the worst, either.
They're still enough to keep you awake.''
	   A veteran of Operation Desert Storm _ he flew 41 combat missions
_ Sturckow couldn't wait to see how the shuttle compared with an
F-18.
	   He's trained as a backup spacewalker in the rare event one of
the two designated spacewalkers becomes ill or is hurt.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Nancy Currie has what the crew considers to be the toughest job:
Using the shuttle robot arm to lash the two space station pieces
together.
	   She'll have to rely on a computerized vision system because the
two components are too big to see out the window. The task, she
says, makes her feel like ``the whole weight of the program'' is on
her shoulders. Her 11-year-old daughter's advice? ``Be careful out
there, Mom.''
	   Currie, 39, an Army lieutenant colonel with a Ph.D. in
industrial engineering, worked as a helicopter instructor pilot
before joining NASA in 1987 to work on the shuttle training
aircraft. NASA picked her as an astronaut in 1990; this is her
third spaceflight.
	   She is from Troy, Ohio.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Jerry Ross got honorary membership in the ironworkers' union
after he tested space station construction back in 1985. Now, he'll
do it for real.
	   As the crew's lead spacewalker, Ross will attach electrical
connectors and cables between the first two station parts. He says
the three spacewalks will be ``a heck of a lot more fun'' than his
steel mill and highway construction work back in his college days.
	   ``If you design the job right, it's easier work. If we don't,
then we pay for it in spades,'' says Ross, 50, an Air Force colonel
from Crown Point, Ind.
	   Ross will have seven spacewalks to his credit by flight's end,
making him NASA's most experienced spacewalker. He's also one of
NASA's most seasoned space fliers; this is his sixth mission since
becoming an astronaut in 1980.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   James Newman says being assigned as a spacewalking construction
worker earned him points with his father-in-law, a civil engineer.
	   ``He's glad to have a son-in-law who's in the construction
business,'' he says, emphasizing the last two words.
	   Newman, 42, a physicist and three-time space flier from San
Diego, has one spacewalk to his credit and will have three more by
flight's end. This is his third shuttle mission but his first with
children at home. He and his wife have a 2-year-old boy and
10-month-old girl, which made launch day tougher than ever.
	   ``I recognize the risk,'' he says, ``but this is what I have
wanted to do for a long, long time.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev is getting a sneak preview.
	   He's scheduled to move into the international space station in
early 2000. After that mission kept getting delayed _ the
five-month stint should have begun in May _ he was added to this
flight so the crew could benefit from his knowledge of Russian
station hardware.
	   Krikalev, 40, is the crew's most experienced spaceman. He flew
to Mir twice, spending a total of 15 months there in the late 1980s
and early 1990s. And in 1994, he became the first Russian to fly on
a NASA shuttle.
	   He says it will be sad to see Mir replaced by the international
space station.
	   ``But sometimes to build something, you need to replace old
things with new,'' he notes. ``Some old shoes could be very
convenient, but you need to change shoes from time to time.''

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Space shuttle Endeavour and a crew
of six blasted off Friday on NASA's first space station
construction flight, lighting up the pre-dawn sky on their way to
orbit.
	   It was the second launch attempt in as many days.
	   ``Let's go do this,'' said commander Robert Cabana.
	   ``Amen,'' replied a launch controller.
	   This time, the master alarm in Endeavour's cockpit behaved. It
went off with just 4{ minutes remaining in Thursday's countdown,
forcing a delay. The weather also cooperated, despite forecasters'
earlier call for rain.
	   Columbia lifted off at 3:35 a.m. with the second component of
the international space station just seconds after the first part,
placed in orbit two weeks ago by the Russians, soared over Cape
Canaveral. The full moon gleamed as the chase began.
	   The shuttle, which reached orbit after a smooth 8-minute ride,
is to meet up with the Russian component on Sunday.
	   On Thursday, the master alarm blared and red lights flashed just
before the shuttle was to lift off. By the time controllers traced
the problem to a momentary drop in hydraulic pressure and decided
to press ahead, it was too late _ they had missed the cutoff by a
second or two.
	   ``Sure, it's frustrating,'' said Bill Readdy, shuttle program
director and a veteran shuttle commander. ``But we do things right.
We do things by the book, and we're not going to cut any corners
even if it means just shaving a second or two.''
	   The six astronauts crawled out of the shuttle, and two threw up
their hands. Cabana held up his thumb and index finger a half-inch
apart: ``We were that close.''
	   The problem was confined to one of Endeavour's three hydraulic
pressure units. The pressure dropped just long enough to trigger
the alarm, evidently because of a sensitive switch, then returned
to normal. NASA engineers spent the day examining the problem, but
found nothing wrong with any of the systems and were confident it
would not reoccur.
	   Endeavour's 12-day flight is already a year late because of a
cash crunch in Russia, one of NASA's partners in building the
international space station. The one-day delay cost NASA about
$600,000, mostly in fuel and overtime pay.
	   Aboard Endeavour is an American-made connecting passageway named
Unity. The astronauts will use the shuttle robot arm to capture the
Russian space station piece and attach it to Unity. Then, two
spacewalkers will hook up all the electrical connections and cables
between the two cylinders, and attach handrails and tools for
future crews.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other dignitaries from
around the world gathered again to see Endeavour and its crew off.
	   ``Here we have 16 countries cooperating on a venture to the
future,'' said Albright. ``This is a good investment.''

President vetoes law allowing partial release of secret files
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ President Aleksander Kwasniewski on Friday
vetoed a law passed by parliament that would allow victims of
communist-era repression to see their secret police files.
	   Under the law, an Institute of National Remembrance would be set
up to collect communist files from 1944-89, as well as documents of
Stalinist and Nazi crimes. The institute would make the files
available to victims of the totalitarian regimes and reveal who
informed on them.
	   Kwasniewski, a former communist, argued that a court, not the
commission, should decide who was a victim. He also wanted all
citizens to have access to the files, not just victims, according
to presidential lawyer Ryszard Kalisz.
	   The bill now goes back to parliament, where the powerful Sejm
chamber can override Kwasniewski's veto if it approves the measure
by more than a 60 percent majority.
	   Nine years after toppling communist rule, Poland still grapples
with the question of dealing with the oppressive regime that kept
secret police files on many people, especially those suspected of
anti-government activity.
	   Another bill that requires government officials, judges and
others to declare if they ever worked for or collaborated with the
former security service took effect last week. Anyone making a
false declaration can lose their job.
	   The issue of disclosing the past is divided along political
lines, with former communists now at the vanguard of the leftist
political parties saying dredging up such information will cause
problems while rightists from the anti-communist opposition push to
reveal all.
	   In particular, the rightists such as leaders of the Solidarity
movement that heads the governing alliance warn former government
agents could be controlled or blackmailed by criminal gangs or
foreign intelligence.
	   But leftists have their own warning: the files are incomplete,
with many of them destroyed, and any information in them might be
inaccurate due to the uncontrolled work of the Security Service,
which was disbanded in 1990.
	   That could cause chaos, they say, such as the ouster of the
government of Prime Minister Jan Olszewski in 1992 after a list it
compiled of alleged communist collaborators was leaked.
	   ``I have a feeling ... that there will be a lot of harm,'' said
Jozef Oleksy, an ex-communist who was forced to resign as prime
minister in 1996 under allegations put forward by the secret
service that he was a KGB informer.
	   After several months, a military prosecutor cleared Oleksy of
any wrongdoing.
	   ``The accusation is printed in big letters on front pages while
... the apology either never gets printed or it is published in a
very narrow circulation,'' he said.
	   But Solidarity founder Lech Walesa, the first post-communist
president, said the present generation must pay the price for
Poland's tragic past.
	   ``There will be victims, but you cannot settle this problem
without victims,'' he said. Enduring the controversy now would end
all speculation and ``mud slinging,'' he argued.

Russian inflation to top 70 percent this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Inflation has gone up more than 65 percent so far
this year and is expected to top 70 percent by the end of the year,
the government said Friday.
	   Russian inflation had been coming down after years of soaring
prices and was expected to be in single digits this year until the
country's economic crisis hit in August.
	   Prices skyrocketed in August and September, but have begun to
level off in recent months.
	   Inflation was up 65.3 percent for the first 11 months of this
year, the State Statistics Committee said Friday, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   Inflation has been running at about 5 percent a month for the
past two months, and the final figure for the year is expected to
be a bit over 70 percent.
	   The government is urgently seeking foreign assistance to help
ease its cash shortage. But no assistance is likely in the near
future, and the government has warned that it may have to begin
printing money, which could lead to a new round of uncontrolled
inflation.
	   Russia suffered from hyperinflation in the early 1990s, but the
rate was down to 11 percent last year.

Yeltsin plans to meet officials in hospital, no word on release
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin planned to meet government
officials Friday in the hospital where he's been treated for
pneumonia for nearly two weeks, his spokesman said.
	   Spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin wouldn't say when Yeltsin would be
discharged from the government hospital where he was admitted on
Nov. 22. Other aides said this week that the president may return
to work at the Kremlin on Monday, but there was no sign that the
president was about to be released.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, one of Russia's most prominent
politicians and a likely presidential candidate, said the
president's frequent ailments have weakened the government.
	   ``The president is ill indeed and he can work effectively only
for a small part of his working time,'' Luzhkov said in an
interview with Germany's ARD television on Thursday night. ``All of
us feel the absence of the president.''
	   However, ``even the fact that the president is in place is a
certain stabilizing factor for the society,'' Luzhkov said in
remarks that were also carried by the Interfax news agency. ``There
is no reason to see the president's health problem as equal to the
danger of the country's collapse.''
	   Yeltsin's bout of pneumonia is his second in as many years and
the latest in a string of illnesses that have eroded his authority
and raised doubts about his ability to serve out a term that ends
in 2000.
	   Ruslan Orekhov, head of the presidential legal department,
dismissed speculation that Yeltsin's was growing weaker and that
the president employs a machine, rather than his own hand, to sign
official documents.
	   ``The facsimile (machine) is never used on presidential
orders,'' Orekhov told the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, adding that
it's only used on occasion to sign routine documents.
	   Orekhov also denied allegations that documents presented to
Yeltsin are typed in extra large letters to make them easier to
read.
	   At several public ceremonies, Yeltsin has signed documents in an
extremely slow and laborious manner, but Orekhov said this was
merely a personal habit, not a sign of his weakness.

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Space shuttle Endeavour and its crew
of six blazed a brilliant trail into orbit Friday, taking off on
the first construction flight of the international space station.
	   ``Let's go do this,'' said commander Robert Cabana, who along
with his crew waited a full year for this day.
	   ``Amen,'' a launch controller replied.
	   The entire sky flashed when Endeavour's boosters ignited at 3:35
a.m. The shuttle shone like a bright star and was visible for more
than seven minutes as it sped out over the Atlantic and up the East
Coast.
	   About one minute later, Endeavour was cruising in orbit, bound
for a Sunday rendezvous with the first space station component
launched by the Russians. The component had just passed over Cape
Canaveral when the shuttle blasted off. The full moon gleamed as
the chase began.
	   Endeavour is carrying Part 2, an American-built connecting
passageway that the astronauts will attach to the piece that
preceded them into orbit by two weeks.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was among the dignitaries
from around the world who returned for Endeavour's second launch
attempt. The first, on Thursday, was scrapped when the master alarm
in the shuttle cockpit went off with just 4{ minutes remaining in
the countdown. This time, the alarm behaved.
	   Another alarm sounded, however, soon after Endeavour reached
orbit. One of three hydraulic power units overheated, and the
pilots switched to a backup controller to cool it before shutting
down each unit as planned. Mission Control said engineers were
looking into the problem but did not expect it to impact the 12-day
flight.
	   Albright congratulated the launch team after witnessing her
first shuttle launch.
	   ``In foreign policy, we have our version of launches and we
don't get it right the second time often, so all my admiration to
you,'' she said. She also plugged the space station: ``As secretary
of state, all day long I deal with disputes on the ground,
countries that can't get along, and it's great to look at this
space station endeavor.''
	   Sixteen countries have teamed up to build the outpost in the
sky, one year late in the making because of a cash crunch in Russia
that has stalled work on a crucial control module.
	   Forty-three more U.S. and Russian launches will be needed over
the next five years to haul up space station parts. And 162
spacewalks will be required to put all the pieces together and keep
them maintained; the first three are slated for Endeavour's flight.
	   Once the first two components are connected with the help of
Endeavour's robot arm and thrusters _ the hardest job of the
mission, according to the crew _ Jerry Ross and James Newman will
go out to join all the electrical connections and cables by hand.
They'll also attach handrails and other tools for future crews.
	   ``The missions don't get any easier than ours,'' Cabana said of
the assembly flights to come. ``Many of them are a lot more
difficult so it's a learning experience.''
	   Astronauts won't be back to the fledgling station, once it's
released from Endeavour, until May 1999. And astronauts and
cosmonauts won't move in until early 2000; that's assuming the
Russians launch their oft-delayed and still unfinished command
module next summer. NASA has funneled $60 million to the Russians
to ensure its completion, and millions more may be needed.
	   The bailout irks Ralph DeGennaro, executive director of the
politically independent group Taxpayers for Common Sense. He said
in a statement following Thursday's postponement that ``NASA should
not just delay but actually cancel the most costly manned space
program in the history of humankind.''
	   As for the one-day delay, which cost NASA $600,000, engineers
traced the alarm to a sensitive switch in Endeavour's hydraulic
power system.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A lack of goodwill in Kosovo threatens the
``very difficult'' mission of unarmed foreign observers sent by the
European diplomatic alliance, Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek
said Friday.
	   Geremek, the outgoing chairman of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, called the Kosovo mission a crucial step
for the Vienna-based organization that seeks to quell conflict
throughout Europe.
	   ``The success of the mission seems now to be blocked by a lack
of goodwill of all participants,'' he told a news conference after
returning from an OSCE conference in Oslo, Norway. ``The mission
faces a very difficult task.''
	   The 2,000-strong OSCE mission, still being set up, will try to
verify if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is complying with
agreements he reached with U.S. envoys and the OSCE to halt
violence in Kosovo and start political negotiations.
	   Under the agreements, Milosevic has removed some Yugoslav troops
and Serb police from the restive Serb province where the ethnic
Albanian majority seeks independence.
	   A crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists that began in
February led to fighting that killed hundreds and forced 300,000
people from their homes. Fearing a humanitarian catastrophe, NATO
threatened air strikes on Milosevic's forces in October to force
him to agree to halt his offensive and allow international
organizations to feed and shelter displaced people.
	   Most of the refugees have returned to their homes or villages,
but sporadic violence by ethnic Albanian guerrillas and Serb and
Yugoslav forces continues. In the latest incidents, Yugoslav border
guards killed eight ethnic Albanians on Thursday.
	   Efforts by U.S. diplomats to start political talks have stalled,
though some progress occurred this week when the ethnic Albanian
guerrillas softened their demand for independence by accepting the
principle of an interim period of autonomy.
	   Geremek, a veteran of Poland's Solidarity movement that ousted
communist rule in 1989, called the shift by the rebels a positive
sign.
	   He called Kosovo ``the biggest challenge for the OSCE and also
the biggest chance to show that it is a necessary organization in
Europe.'' While the humanitarian crisis has been avoided, he said
``everything or almost everything is still to be done'' in building
trust and democratic institutions in the region.
	   Asked about Poland's role as the OSCE revolving chairman for the
past year, Geremek said the experience raised Poland's profile and
prestige in the changing political climate of Europe.
	   Poland will next year join the Czech Republic and Hungary as the
first three former Soviet bloc countries to join NATO, their former
enemy.
	   ``Thanks to the OSCE chairmanship, Poland enters NATO as a
country with an important position,'' he said. ``It has become an
attractive political partner.''

Seventy percent of budget goes to army
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Parliament passed next year's
federal budget, which allots 70 percent of expenditures to the
Yugoslav army, the daily Danas reported Friday.
	   The budget of 15,8 billion dinars (dlrs 1,58 billion), adopted
Thursday, is 63.5 percent higher than the 1998 budget. After years
of international sanctions and military campaigns against
non-Serbs, the Yugoslav economy is in ruins.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has used the army to back
Serbs against other ethnic groups in the region several times over
the past decade, most recently against militant ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
	   His government has allotted around 60 to 70 percent of the
federal budget to the military in recent years, apparently in an
attempt to ensure loyalty and lessen complaints of underfunding
from ranking officers.
	   Milosevic is particularly interested in keeping generals happy
in the wake of a recent purge of officials critical of his
policies, including Gen. Momcilo Perisic, the army chief of staff.
	   The parliament session was boycotted by pro-reformist
legislators from Montenegro, which makes up Yugoslavia along with
larger Serbia. The legislators oppose Milosevic's appointment of
Momir Bulatovic as Yugoslav premier after Bulatovic was ousted as
Montenegro's president in elections last year.

Russian ruble tumbles, inflation to top 70 percent this year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ruble lower, industrial production down 5 percent
this year, ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian ruble tumbled again Friday, trading at
about 20 to the U.S. dollar and threatening to hit its lowest point
since the country's economic crisis struck in August.
	   The ruble's latest slide is an ominous sign for the government,
which desperately wants to stabilize the economy as Russia heads
into the difficult winter months.
	   With President Boris Yeltsin hospitalized, and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov still struggling to implement a recovery plan, the
economy continues to founder and remains vulnerable to additional
shocks.
	   The government is urgently seeking foreign help, but
International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus came and left
this week without giving any signal that a frozen loan package will
be released soon.
	   With the country's financial markets essentially wiped out by
the economic crisis, the value of the ruble is one of the leading
indicators of economic confidence, and it is again on the decline.
	   After stabilizing temporarily at about 16 to the dollar, it has
been falling in recent days. The rate set by the Moscow Interbank
Currency Exchange was 19.6 on Friday, and in street trading it took
more than 20 rubles to purchase one U.S. dollar.
	   The ruble dipped below 20 to the dollar shortly after the
country's economic crisis hit in August, then made a modest
comeback. The ruble was at about 6 to the dollar before the crisis.
	   Meanwhile, the government announced that inflation has gone up
more than 65 percent so far this year and is expected to top 70
percent by year's end.
	   Russian inflation had been coming down after years of soaring
prices and was expected to be in single digits this year until the
country's economic crisis hit.
	   If the government does not receive foreign assistance soon, it
is expected to start printing more rubles to pay off millions of
workers and pensioners who haven't received their money for months.
	   But the additional money is almost certain to push inflation
higher and would risk bringing back the hyperinflation that Russia
suffered during the early 1990s.
	   Russia's problems could get worse next year when its dlrs 17.5
billion dollar foreign debt falls due. Several officials have
already said the country won't be able to meet these payments and
have called for creditors to set new terms for payment.

Ukraine's president proposes floating rate for national currency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma has ordered the
government to study the possibility of allowing the national
currency to float freely as of next year, a news report said
Friday.
	   In another development, the country's inflation was 3 percent in
October, down from 6.2 in October, officials said.
	   Overall inflation so far in 1998 has amounted to 16.2 percent,
but 13 percent of that increase has come in the past three months,
the State Statistics Committee said.
	   In a special resolution, Kuchma told the Cabinet and the
National Bank to consider abandoning the present trading band for
the currency, the hryvna, and replace it with a floating rate as of
Jan. 1, the independent Ukrainian News agency said.
	   The order came two weeks after Kuchma began speaking in favor of
softer monetary policies _ including lifting currency controls and
printing more money _ to allow the government to ease its mounting
debt burden.
	   The National Bank has worked to keep the hryvna stable since
November at 3.4 to the U.S. dollar, within a government-set trading
band of 2.5 to 3.5 to the dollar.
	   The stabilization followed two months of financial turmoil,
caused in part by the economic crisis in neighboring Russia. The
hryvna fell sharply, forcing the government to widen the old
trading band of 1.8 to 2.25 to the dollar.
	   The National Bank managed to temporarily stabilize the markets
in the past two months with the imposition of various currency
controls. But the bank has warned repeatedly that the stability was
too fragile to permit looser monetary policies in the near future.
	   National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko said recently that the
financial situation in Russia, Belarus and Moldova _ Ukraine's
major trade partners _ continued to worsen.
	   However, Ukraine urgently needs to raise several hundred million
dollars to keep the 1998 budget deficit at 2.5 percent of gross
domestic product. That's one of the main requirements set by the
International Monetary Fund for the disbursement of a recently
approved dlrs 2.2 billion loan.
	   The Cabinet's chronically lax tax collection and failure to
implement reforms needed to boost economic activity have led
government leaders to suggest printing money and devaluing the
hryvna to avoid a deeper crisis.
	   The government so far has made ends meet by not paying wages,
pensions and social spending debts, which Kuchma said currently
total 8.5 billion hryvna (dlrs 2.5 billion), or 40 percent of next
year's projected budget revenues.

President vetoes law allowing partial release of secret files

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A longstanding political dispute over how
to confront Poland's bitter past rekindled Friday when President
Aleksander Kwasniewski vetoed a bill that would open secret police
files to victims of communist-era repression.
	   The issue pits former communists like Kwasniewski against the
anti-communist Solidarity movement that now heads a governing
coalition, extending their decades-old conflict that shaped Polish
history and toppled communist rule nine years ago.
	   Passed by parliament on Sept. 22, the bill would create an
Institute of National Remembrance to collect communist files from
1944-89, as well as documents of Stalinist and Nazi crimes. The
institute would make the files available to victims and reveal who
informed on them.
	   It also would empower the institute to launch investigations to
establish those responsible for persecution or political murders.
	   Kwasniewski argued the law would give too much power to the
institute managing the files. He also said all Poles, not only
victims of totalitarian regimes, should be allowed to see their
records.
	   The veto sends the law back to parliament, which could override
it with a 60 percent majority in the powerful Sejm chamber. But the
governing coalition headed by Solidarity lacks enough seats to
guarantee an override, and officials said Friday they would prepare
a new bill.
	   ``This decision shows that the president wants to block the
truth about our history of the time when millions of our
compatriots were being persecuted,'' said Solidarity chairman
Marian Krzaklewski.
	   Others charged that Kwasniewski, leader of a reformed communists
party until forced to relinquish the post after his 1995 election
victory over Solidarity founder Lech Walesa, was reluctant to go
against the wishes of his leftist colleagues.
	   But Kwasniewski's lawyer said the president might prepare his
own draft of the law.
	   In October, Kwasniewski signed another law that requires
government officials, judges and others to declare if they ever
worked for or collaborated with the former security service. Under
the law, which took effect last week, those making false
declarations can lose their job.
	   The question of confronting more than four decades of
totalitarian rule puts pressure on Poland's political fault line,
with Solidarity continuing to criticize decades of communism and
leftists with roots in the totalitarian rule unable to openly
accept blame for past policies.
	   Solidarity leaders, who push for disclosing the truth, say
secret files should be open to ensure historical justice and make
sure criminals of the past no longer hold power, even if that
forces out top political leaders.
	   They also warn that former agents hiding their past could be
controlled or blackmailed by criminal gangs or foreign governments.
	   Former communists, who now form the largest opposition bloc, say
the files are incomplete and unreliable, a result of uncontrolled
work by the dreaded Security Service of the communist era.
	   Some also argue opening the files could cause political turmoil,
like the first attempt to deal with the matter. In 1992, the
rightist government of Jan Olszewski was toppled on a no-confidence
vote after releasing an unconfirmed list of alleged communist
agents.
	   ``There will be a lot of harm,'' said Jozef Oleksy, an
ex-communist who was forced to resign as prime minister in 1996 due
to allegations that he was a Moscow informer.
	   A military prosecutor eventually cleared Oleksy of any
wrongdoing.
	   ``The accusation is printed in big letters on front pages while
... the apology either never gets printed or it is published in a
very narrow circulation,'' he said.
	   Walesa, however, called Kwasniewski's decision ``a mistake'' and
said secret files should be opened as soon as possible to clear the
political scene.
	   ``There will be victims, but you cannot settle this problem
without victims,'' he said. Enduring the controversy now, he
argued, would end all speculation and ``mud-slinging.''

Yeltsin meets prime minister in hospital, no word on release

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin meeting Primakov in hospital. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, who remains hospitalized
with pneumonia, met Friday with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
the Kremlin said.
	   No details of their meeting were immediately released, and
presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin wouldn't say when Yeltsin
will be discharged from the government hospital where he was
admitted on Nov. 22.
	   Other aides said this week that the president may return to work
at the Kremlin on Monday, but there was no sign that the president
was about to be released.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, one of Russia's most prominent
politicians and a likely presidential candidate, said the
president's frequent ailments have weakened the government.
	   ``The president is ill indeed and he can work effectively only
for a small part of his working time,'' Luzhkov said in an
interview with Germany's ARD television on Thursday night. ``All of
us feel the absence of the president.''
	   However, ``even the fact that the president is in place is a
certain stabilizing factor for the society,'' Luzhkov said in
remarks that were also carried by the Interfax news agency. ``There
is no reason to see the president's health problem as equal to the
danger of the country's collapse.''
	   Yeltsin's bout of pneumonia is his second in as many years and
the latest in a string of illnesses that have eroded his authority
and raised doubts about his ability to serve out a term that ends
in 2000.
	   Ruslan Orekhov, head of the presidential legal department,
dismissed speculation that Yeltsin's was growing weaker and that
the president employs a machine, rather than his own hand, to sign
official documents.
	   ``The facsimile (machine) is never used on presidential
orders,'' Orekhov told the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, adding that
it's only used on occasion to sign routine documents.
	   Orekhov also denied allegations that documents presented to
Yeltsin are typed in extra large letters to make them easier to
read.
	   At several public ceremonies, Yeltsin has signed documents in an
extremely slow and laborious manner, but Orekhov said this was
merely a personal habit, not a sign of his weakness.

Responding to crisis, Russia delivers food, fuel to needy areas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia launched operations Friday to bring food
and fuel to needy outposts in the far northeast, where the
country's economic crisis has made a hard life even harder for many
people.
	   More than 30 tons of food were delivered to three places in the
Chukotka Peninsula, including Wrangel Island, where three
filmmakers were airlifted to safety earlier in the week after they
ran out of food.
	   Villagers on the island have also been running low on supplies,
and a helicopter brought one ton of vegetables to the village of
Ushakovsky as part of a larger arctic airlift, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   A fuel tanker left the southeastern port of Nakhodka with more
than 15,000 tons of fuel that it was taking to two ports on the
Chukotka Peninsula, one of many places in the northeast where fuel
supplies have become critically low as a result of the economic
crisis.
	   ITAR-Tass said the tanker Samotlor is expected to reach the
ports of Egvenkinot and Providence in a week, but will have to wait
for an icebreaker to lead it into port.
	   In the southeastern territory of Primorsky, officials announced
a program to stockpile food reserves to protect people from the
effects of potentially steep price increases. Inflation is expected
to be over 70 percent this year.
	   In other signs of tough economic times:
	   _ Several hundred teachers in northern city of Arkhangelsk, who
have been on strike since Nov. 12, picketed the mayor's office and
city administration, demanding wages that haven't been paid for up
to five months, ITAR-Tass said.
	   _ Ambulance crews in the Ural Mountains city of Nizhny Tagil
held a two-hour warning strike during which they responded only to
extreme emergencies. They are demanding wages that haven't been
paid for four months.

Russian ruble tumbles, inflation to top 70 percent this year

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian ruble tumbled again Friday, trading at
about 20 to the U.S. dollar and threatening to hit its lowest point
since the country's economic crisis struck in August.
	   The ruble's latest slide is an ominous sign for the government,
which desperately wants to stabilize the economy as Russia heads
into the difficult winter months.
	   With President Boris Yeltsin hospitalized, and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov still struggling to implement a recovery plan, the
economy continues to founder and remains vulnerable to additional
shocks.
	   Primakov said the government would not attempt to fix the ruble
rate, and would continue to let dollars circulate freely in Russia.
He acknowledged that the crisis had left the government with few
good options.
	   ``The government has found it has less room to maneuver in these
conditions than it had a year or two ago,'' Primakov told a session
of the World Economic Forum in Moscow.
	   He blamed previous governments for the country's economic
turmoil and said a lack of stability, as well as the loss of
confidence in the country's future had jeopardized economic reform
efforts.
	   Primakov's government is urgently seeking foreign help, but
International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus came and left
this week without giving any signal that a frozen loan package will
be released soon.
	   With the country's financial markets essentially wiped out by

indicators of economic confidence, and it is again on the decline.
	   After stabilizing temporarily at about 16 to the dollar, it has

	   The ruble dipped below 20 to the dollar shortly after the
country's economic crisis hit in August before making a modest
comeback. The ruble was at about 6 to the dollar before the crisis.
	   Meanwhile, the government announced that inflation has gone up

EU: Better Cuba ties only possible if Havana improves rights
</HEADLINE>
record &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - In a statement directed as much at
Havana as Washington, the European Union said Monday relations with
Cuba won't improve unless that country improves its human rights
record.
	   The EU foreign ministers said in a statement they want to help
Cuba become a pluralist democracy but that Havana showed no
interest in that.
	   The statement was a twice-annual report the EU agreed to carry
out as part of a challenge in recent years of U.S. law punishing
European companies for doing business in Cuba.
	   The Europeans argued the Helms-Burton act violated international
trade law, denied being soft on Cuba and pledged to step up
monitoring of human rights there.
	   The EU ministers reaffirmed their wish ``to become a partner
with Cuba with a view to progressively and irreversibly opening up
the Cuban economy.''
	   However, they added, ``It will only be possible to cooperate
fully with Cuba if the situation improves as far as human rights
and fundamental freedoms are concerned,''
	   EU relations with Cuba remain remain tenuous. The best the EU
has been able to do for Cuba this year is granting the country
observer status in negotiations between the EU and 71 developing
countries.

Parliament urges Moscow city to restore statue of dreaded police

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament's lower house on Wednesday gave final
approval to a resolution calling on the Moscow city government to
resurrect a statue of the infamous Soviet secret police chief Felix
Dzerzhinsky.
	   The Communist-dominated State Duma voted 255-102 to urge the
city officials to return the statue of Dzerzhinsky to the spot it
occupied for decades on the Lubyanka Square in front of the old KGB
headquarters. They said it would be a ``symbol of the fight against
crime in Russia.''
	   But Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the liberal Yabloko faction, said
Dzerzhinsky symbolized ruthless political repression, and the
resolution showed that today's Communists had not changed their
attitudes from the Soviet era.
	   ``It's now clear that all Communist talk about being a new,
reformed party is a cynical lie,'' Yavlinsky said on Echo Moscow
radio.
	   ``If they come to power in Russia, they would use the same
methods this man (Dzerzhinsky) used _ physical extermination of
their opponents. Their ideal of justice is summary executions in
the basements.''
	   The Duma's resolution is non-binding, and the city legislative
must approve all decisions on monuments.
	   The Communists are the leading faction in parliament, but are
much less influential in the Moscow city parliament, which may
block the move to restore the statue.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov hasn't yet commented on the Duma's
move. Luzhkov, a leading presidential hopeful, has often criticized
the Communists.
	   The towering bronze statue of ``Iron Felix,'' head of the first
secret police organization in the Soviet era, was a major Moscow
landmark during Soviet times.
	   It was toppled by pro-democracy protesters in 1991 and has since
languished with other Soviet-era statues in a city park.
	   The statue stood on Lubyanka Square, and human rights groups
have used the spot in recent years to hold vigils to honor the
millions of victims of Soviet repressions.
	   Yabloko suggested on Friday that a monument to victims be put on
Lubyanka instead of Dzerzhinsky's statue, but the proposal failed
to pass.
	   Yabloko members also proposed an end to the state financing of
Vladimir Lenin's embalmed body and his mausoleum on Red Square. But
the motion was overwhelmingly defeated.
	   Yuri Nikiforenko, a Communist lawmaker, assailed Yabloko for
trying to block a ``scientific experiment to preserve Lenin's
body.''
	   Oleg Morozov, the leader of a moderate Russia's Regions faction,
urged his colleagues to stop ``trying to rewrite history.''
	   ``This political necrophilia isn't improving the image of our
parliament,'' he said.

Kosovo rebels reject political compromise; new shootouts erupt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with rebels rejecting interim status, new
border shootings; No pickup &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo rebels refused Friday to
accept anything short of complete independence, rejecting a
U.S.-proposed settlement as new border shootings put dangerous
strains on the province's fragile peace.
	   Escalating violence in Kosovo, including a shootout Friday that
killed a woman in the province's second-largest city, has lent new
urgency to American-led efforts to get Serbs and ethnic Albanians
to agree on a plan for Kosovo's future. Thirteen ethnic Albanians
have been reported killed this week.
	   But the Kosovo Liberation Army dealt diplomacy a setback by
declaring it would not accept any peace deal short of independence
_ dismissing recent signals that it was ready to support a U.S.
proposal.
	   The ethnic Albanian guerrillas said in a statement distributed
in Pristina that they would not accept any political solution
``which would harm the ideals of our people toward independence, or
which would cement, even temporarily, an imposed joint life in an
anti-Albanian, anti-democratic'' system.
	   A KLA political representative signaled last week the rebels
were ready to postpone complete independence, but the KLA said on
Friday it was ``undeterred'' in its fight for an independent state.
	   The rebels said they issue a detailed response later to a
revised American-backed plan, which was distributed to the Serb and
ethnic Albanian sides this week. It calls for an interim political
status for Kosovo.
	   Dozens of people have died in sporadic clashes since an Oct.
12-brokered peace agreement brought a halt to seven months of
fighting in the secessionist province, which is overwhelmingly
ethnic Albanian.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova renewed his call
for international military intervention in the wake of the latest
violence.
	   ``NATO ground troop deployment would provide a greater sense of
security,'' he said at a news conference.
	   A reported clash Friday in the western town of Pec raised the
death toll from the last three days alone to 13 _ all ethnic
Albanians.
	   The Serb-run Media Center said six people also were wounded in a
shootout that erupted after a man and woman attacked a Serb
policeman guarding Pec's hospital. The two reportedly shot and
wounded the policeman, who then fired his automatic rifle and also
injured five bystanders.
	   The Serb center said the female attacker was killed by other
guards while her partner escaped.
	   In another reported incident, Yugoslav border guards reportedly
shot at 10 ethnic Albanians who tried to cross illegally into
Yugoslavia from Albania and allegedly fired at the guards first.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is assembling a force of 2,000 unarmed international verifiers in
Kosovo, declined to single out Serb forces or Kosovo rebels for the
rising violence.
	   The OSCE mission, still being set up, will try to verify
Yugoslavia's adherence to agreements Belgrade reached with U.S.
envoys and the OSCE to halt violence in Kosovo and start political
negotiations.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 were left
homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a
crackdown in February against rebels who demand independence for
Kosovo.

Demonstrators press ahead with protests in Ukrainian port city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEVASTOPOL, Ukraine (AP) _ Dozens of medical workers
demonstrated Friday for back wages at the main government building
in this port city, the latest in a series of almost daily protests
over the past two months.
	   The doctors, along with teachers and pensioners, are demanding
overdue money that has been delayed for more than a year in some
cases.
	   Demonstrators are also angry with energy problems that have left
residents without electricity and heat supplies for several hours
every day.
	   ``How are we supposed to live and work? What do the authorities
think they are doing?'' said Olena Shevelo, director of a
Sevastopol hospital.
	   ``Can you imagine the stress a doctor is subjected to when he
cannot even afford to pay transpiration fees to get to work?'' she
said.
	   During the Soviet era, Sevastopol enjoyed preferential status as
the home port for the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet, which is now
divided between Ukraine and Russia.
	   The continuing economic decline in both countries has left their
governments unable to finance many social needs, and support has
been cut sharply for Sevastopol and its naval bases.
	   Many of the 400,000 people in the city worked at enterprises
linked to the fleet.
	   ``The city today is in an extremely terrible state, and the
situation is such that it could even lead to spontaneous riots,''
said Sevastopol Mayor Vasyl Parkhomenko.
	   He said city authorities had warned the national government in
Kiev about the tense situation in Sevastopol, to little effect. The
city has received only 15 percent of the money it needs to cover
its energy bills and pay salaries, Parkhomenko said.

Yeltsin meets prime minister in hospital, no word on release

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin, who remains hospitalized with
pneumonia, met Friday with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who
advised the president to make a full recovery before returning to
the Kremlin.
	   Primakov told the president, who is known to be a restless
patient, not to rush his return to work, said presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin.
	   Yeltsin was admitted to the hospital on Nov. 22 _ almost two
weeks ago _ and Yakushkin declined to say when he might be
released.
	   Other aides said this week that the president may return to work
at the Kremlin on Monday, but Yakushkin refused to confirm that.
	   ``The president is eager to come back to work at the Kremlin as
early as tomorrow, but doctors don't recommend that,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin has been handling paper work and talking to officials
this week. ``Boris Nikolayevich is in a very energetic mood,''
Yakushkin said.
	   Meanwhile, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, one of Russia's most
prominent politicians and a likely presidential candidate, said the
president's frequent ailments have weakened the government.
	   ``The president is ill indeed and he can work effectively only
for a small part of his working time,'' Luzhkov said in an
interview with Germany's ARD television on Thursday night. ``All of
us feel the absence of the president.''
	   However, ``even the fact that the president is in place is a
certain stabilizing factor for the society,'' Luzhkov said in
remarks that were also carried by the Interfax news agency. ``There
is no reason to see the president's health problem as equal to the
danger of the country's collapse.''
	   Yeltsin's bout of pneumonia is his second in as many years and
the latest in a string of illnesses that have eroded his authority
and raised doubts about his ability to serve out a term that ends
in 2000.
	   Ruslan Orekhov, head of the presidential legal department,
dismissed speculation that Yeltsin's was growing weaker and that
the president employs a machine, rather than his own hand, to sign
official documents.
	   ``The facsimile (machine) is never used on presidential
orders,'' Orekhov told the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, adding that
it's only used on occasion to sign routine documents.
	   Orekhov also denied allegations that documents presented to
Yeltsin are typed in extra large letters to make them easier to
read.
	   At several public ceremonies, Yeltsin has signed documents in an
extremely slow and laborious manner, but Orekhov said this was
merely a personal habit, not a sign of his weakness.

Kosovo Albanians appeal for more help amid escalating violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Kosovo Albanians' political
leader pleaded anew for international military intervention Friday
after the worst breach of an informal cease-fire in the troubled
province.
	   Ibrahim Rugova's appeal came with Kosovo's de-facto truce under
dangerous new strain following the killings of 12 ethnic Albanians
in the previous two days, including eight shot by Yugoslav border
guards.
	   The escalating violence lends added urgency to American-led
diplomatic efforts to reach a political settlement on Kosovo's
status. A day after U.S. envoy Christopher Hill appealed to Serb
officials to accept a revised peace plan, U.S. State Department
officials presented the changes to ethnic Albanian officials Friday
in Kosovo's capital, Pristina.
	   Rugova had no immediate reaction to the revised plan, the
specifics of which were not released. But the Albanian leader
renewed his call for more international assistance in ending
hostilities in Kosovo, where dozens have died in sporadic clashes
since an Oct. 12 U.S.-brokered peace agreement.
	   ``NATO ground troop deployment would provide a greater sense of
security,'' he said at a news conference.
	   The 12 shooting deaths of ethnic Albanians since Wednesday is
``a sign that we need a special security force which will protect
citizens and stop violence in Kosovo,'' Rugova said.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 were left
homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a
crackdown last February against rebels who demand independence for
Kosovo, which is populated overwhelmingly by ethnic Albanians.
	   Bloodshed abated _ but did not end _ after Milosevic agreed on a
cease-fire and promised U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke Oct. 12 to end
the Kosovo campaign and begin political negotiations.
	   The agreement, which staved off threatened NATO airstrikes,
allowed for 2,000 unarmed international monitors to patrol Kosovo,
with NATO flying verification missions overhead.
	   A commander of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, meanwhile,
disputed the Yugoslav army's report that eight ethnic Albanians
shot dead Thursday near the Albanian border were guerrillas.
	   The commander, who gave his name as Sylemetaj, said in Velika
Krusa that the victims were refugees returning to that village in
southwestern Kosovo. Six were students and most were from a single
family clan, the Hotis, he said.
	   Western officials who visited the shooting site said it appeared
the Albanians had stumbled on the army unexpectedly, raising
questions about the army account that the victims were armed rebels
who had fired on them first.
	   The border shootings took place one day after three ethnic
Albanians were gunned down in their car in Pristina, killings the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army blamed on Serbia's secret police.
Another ethnic Albanian was shot dead Wednesday while traveling on
a main Kosovo road.
	   Retaliation by the KLA to those shootings would represent a
grave threat to the already-fragile de-facto truce.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is assembling the force of 2,000 verifiers, said the shooting
incidents appeared unrelated and were unlikely to ``represent a
dramatic change in the security situation in the short term.''
	   Hill is spearheading international efforts to get the Serbs and
Albanians to reach agreement on Kosovo's future status before the
tense Serbian province explodes in new fighting.
	   Ethnic Albanians still insist on independence for Kosovo, while
Serbs reject any plan that would not keep it within Kosovo.
	   A proposal to give Kosovo some form of self-rule for an interim
period until a permanent solution can be found has gained backing
among both Rugova's moderate political bloc and the KLA in recent
days.

Russian ruble tumbles, inflation to top 70 percent this year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos MOSB109-110 &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian ruble tumbled today, trading at about
20 to the U.S. dollar and threatening to hit its lowest point since
the country's economic crisis struck in August.
	   The ruble's latest slide is an ominous sign for the government,
which desperately wants to stabilize the economy as Russia heads
into the difficult winter months.
	   With President Boris Yeltsin hospitalized, and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov still struggling to implement a recovery plan, the
economy continues to founder and remains vulnerable to additional
shocks.
	   Primakov said the government would not attempt to fix the ruble
rate and would continue to let dollars circulate freely in Russia.
He acknowledged the crisis had left the government with few good
options.
	   ``The government has found it has less room to maneuver in these
conditions than it had a year or two ago,'' Primakov told a session
of the World Economic Forum in Moscow.
	   He blamed previous governments for the country's economic
turmoil and said a lack of stability, as well as the loss of
confidence in the country's future, had jeopardized economic reform
efforts.
	   Primakov's government is urgently seeking foreign help, but
International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus came and left
this week without giving any signal that a frozen loan package will
be released soon.
	   With the country's financial markets essentially wiped out by
the economic crisis, the value of the ruble is one of the leading
indicators of economic confidence.
	   After stabilizing temporarily at about 16 to the dollar, it has
been falling in recent days. The official rate was down from 18.8
on Thursday to 19.6 today, and in street trading it took more than
20 rubles to purchase one U.S. dollar.
	   The ruble dipped below 20 to the dollar shortly after the
country's economic crisis hit in August, before making a modest
comeback. The ruble was at about 6 to the dollar before the crisis.
	   Meanwhile, the government announced inflation has gone up more
than 65 percent so far this year and is expected to top 70 percent
by year's end.
	   If the government does not receive foreign assistance soon, it
is expected to start printing more rubles to pay off millions of
workers and pensioners who haven't received their money for months.
	   But the additional money is almost certain to push inflation
higher and could bring back the hyperinflation that Russia suffered
during the early 1990s.
	   Primakov, meanwhile, met with Yeltsin in the hospital today and
advised him to make a full recovery before returning to the
Kremlin, the president's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said.
	   Yeltsin was admitted to the hospital on Nov. 22, and Yakushkin
declined to say when he might be released.

Protesters force the access to government headquarter square
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) _ About 10,000 workers and students
marched Friday to the government headquarters in this former Soviet
republic to protest falling living standards and months without
pay.
	   Workers broke into the square by force after police tried to
block them on grounds the gathering was unauthorized. A policeman
fainted in the struggle.
	   There were no reports of other incidents.
	   The General Federation of Unions organized the protest. Union
head Ion Godonoga said the state owes some one billion lei (dlrs
100 million) in salaries, grants and pensions.
	   Government officials, who refused to talk to the trade unionists
Friday, had offered last week to pay state employees salary arrears
in food and free public services, but unions refused the offer.
	   Several similar protests took place in other cities around the
country of 4.4 million Friday.
	   Communism ended in 1991 after Moldova declared independence
following the breakup of the Soviet Union.
	   Moldova's lagging economy follows Russia, its main trading
partner, in a downturn. Moldova's average monthly salary is 330 lei
(dlrs 33).

World Bank upset by Ukrainian parliament's suspension of projects
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo KIV101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The World Bank is worried that the
Ukrainian parliament has suspended many of the bank's projects in
this former Soviet republic, a bank official said Friday.
	   Several of the projects have never gotten off the ground because
parliament failed to ratify them, said the bank's director for
Ukraine and Belarus, Paul Siegelbaum.
	   The list of suspended projects expanded this week despite a
visit by a World Bank delegation to Kiev, Siegelbaum said during a
meeting with President Leonid Kuchma, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   The leftist-dominated legislature on Tuesday failed to ratify a
deal with the World Bank on providing risk guarantees for foreign
creditors, its third unsuccessful attempt to approve the agreement.
	   The vote came the same day a World Bank delegation arrived in
Ukraine to review current projects and discuss new loans for the
next 18 months.
	   Siegelbaum said parliament could jeopardize another dlrs 140
million in energy loans unless Ukraine's Constitutional Court
revokes the legislators' recent ban on raising utility tariffs,
which the World Bank has insisted is necessary for quicker reform
of the energy sector.
	   The loan could be provided by the end of the year if the
country's highest court overturns the ban, Siegelbaum added.
	   Speaking at a meeting with Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko
later Friday, Siegelbaum said the World Bank intends to channel
most of its aid to reforming Ukraine's energy and agriculture
sectors and supporting private businesses.
	   The World Bank suspended cooperation with Ukraine in March
following the International Monetary Fund's decision to freeze aid
to Ukraine because of stalled economic reforms.
	   The IMF finally approved a dlrs 2.2 billion loan in September
after the government took reform steps, and the World Bank resumed
its cooperation as well, granting dlrs 950 million in loans for
several projects.
	   Ukraine had already received more than dlrs 1.5 billion from the
World Bank since it became a member in 1992.

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Space shuttle Endeavour and its crew
of six blazed a brilliant trail into orbit today, taking off on the
first construction flight of the international space station.
	   ``Let's go do this,'' said commander Robert Cabana, who along
with his crew waited a full year for this day.
	   ``Amen,'' a launch controller replied.
	   The entire sky flashed when Endeavour's boosters ignited at 3:35
a.m. The shuttle shone like a bright star and was visible for more
than seven minutes as it sped out over the Atlantic and up the East
Coast.
	   Eight minutes into the flight, Endeavour was cruising in orbit,
bound for a Sunday rendezvous with the first space station
component launched by the Russians. The component had just passed
over Cape Canaveral when the shuttle blasted off. The full moon
gleamed as the chase began.
	   Endeavour is carrying Part 2, an American-built connecting
passageway that the astronauts will attach to the piece that
preceded them into orbit by two weeks.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was among the dignitaries
from around the world who returned for Endeavour's second launch
attempt. The first, on Thursday, was scrapped when the master alarm
in the shuttle cockpit went off with just 4{ minutes remaining in
the countdown. This time, the alarm behaved.
	   Another alarm sounded, however, soon after Endeavour reached
orbit. One of three hydraulic power units overheated, and the
pilots switched to a backup controller to cool it before shutting
down each unit as planned. Mission Control said engineers were
looking into the problem but did not expect it to impact the 12-day
flight.
	   Albright congratulated the launch team after witnessing her
first shuttle launch.
	   ``In foreign policy, we have our version of launches and we
don't get it right the second time often, so all my admiration to
you,'' she said. She also plugged the space station: ``As secretary
of state, all day long I deal with disputes on the ground,
countries that can't get along, and it's great to look at this
space station endeavor.''
	   Sixteen countries have teamed up to build the outpost in the
sky, one year late in the making because of a cash crunch in Russia
that has stalled work on a crucial control module.
	   Forty-three more U.S. and Russian launches will be needed over
the next five years to haul up space station parts. And 162
spacewalks will be required to put all the pieces together and keep
them maintained; the first three are slated for Endeavour's flight.
	   Once the first two components are connected with the help of
Endeavour's robot arm and thrusters _ the hardest job of the
mission, according to the crew _ Jerry Ross and James Newman will
go out to join all the electrical connections and cables by hand.
They'll also attach handrails and other tools for future crews.
	   ``The missions don't get any easier than ours,'' Cabana said of
the assembly flights to come. ``Many of them are a lot more
difficult so it's a learning experience.''
	   NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin expects ``some white-knuckled
times'' over the next several years.
	   ``This is going to be tough and we're going to have problems''
Goldin said today. ``But we have to go where exactly we want to
be.''
	   Astronauts won't be back to the fledgling station, once it's
released from Endeavour, until May 1999. And astronauts and
cosmonauts won't move in until early 2000; that's assuming the
Russians launch their oft-delayed and still unfinished command
module next summer. NASA has funneled $60 million to the Russians
to ensure its completion, and millions more may be needed.
	   The bailout irks Ralph DeGennaro, executive director of the
politically independent group Taxpayers for Common Sense. He said
in a statement following Thursday's postponement that ``NASA should
not just delay but actually cancel the most costly manned space
program in the history of humankind.''
	   As for the one-day delay, which cost NASA $600,000, engineers
traced the alarm to a sensitive switch in Endeavour's hydraulic
power system.

Russian ruble tumbles, inflation to top 70 percent this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian ruble tumbled again Friday, trading at
about 20 to the U.S. dollar and threatening to hit its lowest point
since the country's economic crisis struck in August.
	   The ruble's latest slide is an ominous sign for the government,
which desperately wants to stabilize the economy as Russia heads
into the difficult winter months.
	   With President Boris Yeltsin hospitalized, and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov still struggling to implement a recovery plan, the
economy continues to founder and remains vulnerable to additional
shocks.
	   Primakov said the government would not attempt to fix the ruble
rate, and would continue to let dollars circulate freely in Russia.
He acknowledged that the crisis had left the government with few
good options.
	   ``The government has found it has less room to maneuver in these
conditions than it had a year or two ago,'' Primakov told a session
of the World Economic Forum in Moscow.
	   He blamed previous governments for the country's economic
turmoil and said a lack of stability, as well as the loss of
confidence in the country's future, had jeopardized economic reform
efforts.
	   ``In such conditions, the crisis can become permanent,'' he
said. ``But the worst consequences of the crisis aren't the fall of
the ruble, or the drop in production, but a total crisis of
confidence between creditors and debtors, owners and managers, the
government and the population.''
	   Primakov's government is urgently seeking foreign help, but
International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus came and left
this week without giving any signal that a frozen loan package will
be released soon.
	   The country's financial markets have been largely wiped out by
the economic crisis, which hit Russia in August after first
ravaging many Asian economies last year.
	   In this environment, the value of the ruble is one of the
leading indicators of economic confidence, and it is again on the
decline.
	   After stabilizing temporarily at about 16 to the dollar, it has
been falling in recent days. The official rate was down from 18.8
on Thursday to 19.6 on Friday, and in street trading it took more
than 20 rubles to purchase one U.S. dollar.
	   The ruble dipped below 20 to the dollar shortly after the
country's economic crisis hit in August before making a modest
comeback. The ruble was at about 6 to the dollar before the crisis.
	   Meanwhile, the government announced that inflation has gone up
more than 65 percent so far this year and is expected to top 70
percent by year's end.
	   Russian inflation had been coming down after years of soaring
prices and was expected to be in single digits this year until the
country's economic crisis hit.
	   If the government does not receive foreign assistance soon, it
is expected to start printing more rubles to pay off millions of
workers and pensioners who haven't received their money for months.
	   But the additional money is almost certain to push inflation
higher and would risk bringing back the hyperinflation that Russia
suffered during the early 1990s.
	   Russia's problems could get worse next year when its dlrs 17.5
billion dollar foreign debt falls due. Several officials have
already said the country won't be able to meet these payments and
have called for creditors to set new terms for payment.

Chief U.N. weapons inspector in Russia to discuss Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Visiting chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler discussed the Iraqi crisis with top Russian officials
Friday, Russian news reports said.
	   Butler, who heads the U.N. Special Commission charged with
making sure Iraq dismantles its weapons of mass destruction, met
with Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk, who oversees Iraq
and other Mideast countries.
	   Butler was scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
later Friday, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Russian government has staunchly opposed the use of force
against Iraq and called for a peaceful solution, while urging Iraq
to fully cooperate with U.N weapons inspectors.
	   Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is expected to arrive in
Moscow on Sunday for a four-day visit that will include a meeting
with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, the Russian Foreign Ministry
said in a statement Friday.
	   On Thursday, Aziz accused U.N. weapons inspectors of providing
enemy intelligence agencies with information obtained from its
weapons searches. Aziz called on U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to stop such contacts.
	   Aziz and the Russians will discuss the situation in Iraq,
``particularly in the context of a comprehensive review by the U.N.
Security Council of the fulfillment of its resolutions by
Baghdad,'' the statement said.
	   The U.N. weapons inspectors must certify that Iraq has complied
with U.N. resolutions calling for the dismantling of the country's
nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and long-range missiles
before the Security Council can lift crippling economic sanctions
imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Baghdad has accused the Special Commission of working on behalf
of the United States to prolong the sanctions.
	   Iraq's recent refusal to cooperate with weapons inspectors
prompted the United States and Britain to threaten a military
strike. Responding to the threat, Iraq agreed Nov. 14 to resume
cooperation with weapons inspectors.
	   Moscow, which is owed billions of dollars from Iraq in debt left
over from Soviet times, is generally sympathetic to the Arab nation
and has called for an early lifting of the sanctions.

Yeltsin meets prime minister in hospital, no word on release
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with no date set for Yeltsin's return to work in 5th

presidential functions in grafs 11-14. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin, who remains hospitalized with
pneumonia, met Friday with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who
advised the president to make a full recovery before returning to
the Kremlin.
	   Primakov told the president, who is known to be a restless
patient, not to rush his return to work, said presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin.
	   Yeltsin was admitted to the hospital on Nov. 22 _ almost two
weeks ago _ and Yakushkin declined to say when he might be
released.
	   Other aides said this week that the president may return to work
at the Kremlin on Monday, but Yakushkin refused to confirm that.
	   ``The president is eager to come back to work at the Kremlin as
early as tomorrow, but doctors don't recommend that,'' Yakushkin
said. ``Doctors are not setting any timetables'' for Yeltsin's
return to work.
	   Yeltsin has been handling paper work and talking to officials
this week. ``Boris Nikolayevich is in a very energetic mood,''
Yakushkin said.
	   Meanwhile, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, one of Russia's most
prominent politicians and a likely presidential candidate, said the
president's frequent ailments have weakened the government.
	   ``The president is ill indeed and he can work effectively only
for a small part of his working time,'' Luzhkov said in an
interview with Germany's ARD television on Thursday night. ``All of
us feel the absence of the president.''
	   However, ``even the fact that the president is in place is a
certain stabilizing factor for the society,'' Luzhkov said in
remarks that were also carried by the Interfax news agency. ``There
is no reason to see the president's health problem as equal to the
danger of the country's collapse.''
	   Yeltsin's bout of pneumonia is his second in as many years and
the latest in a string of illnesses that have eroded his authority
and raised doubts about his ability to serve out a term that ends
in 2000.
	   Primakov has taken over day-to-day economic management,
occasionally replaced Yeltsin in meetings with foreign leaders, and
otherwise kept a high profile _ prompting speculations that the
premier has effectively become acting president.
	   Yakushkin again denied such suggestions Friday.
	   ``Any transfer of the main presidential functions to Primakov is
out of the question,'' Yakushkin said. ``The president still
handles foreign policy, is still in charge of defense and security
agencies.''
	   ``True, specific economic work is handled by Primakov, and
sometimes it so happens, due to various reasons, that Primakov
replaces the president on the international arena,'' he said,
adding that Primakov is merely making full use of his powers as
prime minister.
	   Ruslan Orekhov, head of the presidential legal department,
dismissed speculation that Yeltsin was growing weaker and that the
president employs a machine, rather than his own hand, to sign
official documents.
	   ``The (machine) is never used on presidential orders,'' Orekhov
told the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, adding that it's only used on
occasion to sign routine documents.
	   Orekhov also denied allegations that documents presented to
Yeltsin are typed in extra large letters to make them easier to
read.
	   At several public ceremonies, Yeltsin has signed documents in an
extremely slow and laborious manner, but Orekhov said this was
merely a personal habit, not a sign of weakness.

Kosovo Albanians appeal for more international help
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's leading ethnic Albanian
politician today called for international military intervention
after the killings of 12 people this week put the province's
fragile truce in jeopardy.
	   Ibrahim Rugova said the presence of international troops would
help bring peace to Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians are fighting for
independence from Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   The killings of ethnic Albanians, including eight shot by
Yugoslav border guards on Thursday, put a new strain on the
de-facto truce, which took hold after Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic agreed in October to pull troops back to avoid NATO
airstrikes.
	   Hundreds of people have died and up to 300,000 have been left
homeless since Milosevic launched a crackdown in February against
rebels in Kosovo, which is populated overwhelmingly by ethnic
Albanians.
	   ``NATO ground troop deployment would provide a greater sense of
security,'' Rugova said at a news conference. The shootings are ``a
sign that we need a special security force which will protect
citizens and stop violence in Kosovo,'' he added.
	   U.S. State Department officials presented a revised peace plan
to ethnic Albanian officials today in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, a
day after U.S. envoy Christopher Hill appealed to Serb officials to
accept the changes.
	   A commander of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, meanwhile,
disputed the Yugoslav army's report that the eight ethnic Albanians
shot by guards near the Albanian border were guerrillas.
	   The commander, who gave his name as Sylemetaj, said from Velika
Krusa that the victims were refugees returning to the village in
southwestern Kosovo.
	   Western officials who visited the shooting site said it appeared
the Albanians had stumbled on the army unexpectedly, raising
questions about the army account.
	   On Wednesday, three ethnic Albanians were gunned down in their
car in Pristina, killings the KLA blamed on Serbia's secret police.
Another ethnic Albanian was shot dead Wednesday while traveling on
a main Kosovo road.
	   Retaliation by the KLA to those shootings would represent a
grave threat to the truce.
	   A proposal to give Kosovo some form of self-rule for an interim
period until a permanent solution can be found has gained backing
among both Rugova's moderate political bloc and the KLA in recent
days.
	   ``It's a sign we are ready to compromise to stop the violence
and make peace in Kosovo,'' Rugova said.

Summers, Talbott to Moscow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With the Russian ruble tumbling and President
Boris Yeltsin's health uncertain, the Clinton administration is
sending a group of economics and foreign policy specialists to
Moscow for consultations.
	   A State Department announcement said the trip next week was part
of a regular pattern of talks with Russian government officials.
There was no hint of any anxiety over the slide of the ruble, which
coincides with the onset of difficult winter months and a desperate
effort by the Kremlin to stabilize the economy.
	   Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott plan to head the U.S. delegation for the
talks in Moscow Dec. 10-12. With them will be Leon Fuerth, who
assists Vice President Al Gore on foreign policy issues.
	   In Moscow, Yeltsin is hospitalized and Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov is struggling to implement a recovery plan. There was no
immediate word whether Summers and Talbott would meet with Yeltsin.
	   President Clinton made it clear on his own trip to Moscow three
months ago that Russia should not expect any additional economic
assistance unless it adopted at least a rudimentary system of
banking and loan payments.
	   Since then, Talbott, who plays a key role in making U.S. policy,
warned that Western oil companies would not invest in long-term
projects unless Russia adopted a clear tax system, secured property
rights and showed a willingness to take disputes to international
arbitration.
	   Talbott said the industry would need investments of close to $15
billion a year just to return to Soviet-era production levels.
	   He said Primakov was operating without a realistic budget or a
credible system for collecting taxes. ``Economic decline carries
with it the danger of political drift, turmoil and even crackup,''
he said.
	   Along with hard times has come an intensification of support for
hard-line nationalists and communists.
	   Still, the Clinton administration plans to go ahead with further
meetings of a joint U.S.-Russian commission on cooperation in
economics and technology. One purpose of the talks next week is to
lay the groundwork for the next meeting, the announcement said.

Ukraine's parliament gives initial approval to election bill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Friday gave
preliminary approval to a bill on presidential elections.
	   The bill allows political parties to nominate candidates, or
individuals to nominate themselves, but bars anyone else _ such as
industrial groups or lobbying organizations, who have been active
in previous campaigns _ from putting forth a candidate.
	   Ukraine's next presidential elections are scheduled for next
October.
	   Deputies in the 450-seat legislature voted 249-15 to approve the
first reading of the law.
	   The document requires a turnout of more than 50 percent of
eligible voters to validate the results. A candidate needs to be
supported by more than a half of the voters who cast their ballots
to become a winner in the first round.
	   A simple majority of voters and no voter turnout margin are
required for the second round, between the two best performers from
the first round.
	   Every nominated candidate must collect 1 million signatures _
among Ukraine's 35 million eligible voters _ to be on the ballot.
	   The bill approved Friday is to pass two more readings before
final approval.
	   President Leonid Kuchma, in office since 1994, has said he would
seek second presidential term.
	   He faces a growing army of contenders, which already includes
influential former parliament speaker Oleksandr Moroz and former
Prime Minister Yevhen Marchuk. As many as a dozen candidates are
expected to take part.
	   However, analysts expect no quick approval for the presidential
elections law. They have predicted divisions among supporters of
Kuchma and those of other candidates over the law's key provisions,
depending on whether they're seen to favor the incumbent or his
challengers.

Death toll from Armenian sanitarium explosion rises to 11
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ The death toll from an explosion at a
children's wing of an Armenian resort rose to 11 on Friday, as
rescuers found seven more bodies, including three children.
	   Investigators believe the explosion may have been cause by a gas
leak.
	   Twelve people, two of them children, were wounded in the blast
Thursday in a cafeteria at the resort, the State Emergency
Department said. Four adult victims were found Thursday and
rescuers continued to search through rubble Friday.
	   The children's sanitarium in Dzhermuk _ a well-known mineral
water resort 150 kilometers (90 miles) southeast of Armenia's
capital, Yerevan _ housed children accompanied by their mothers.
	   Forty-two people were in the building at the time of the blast,
though it was unclear how many were in the cafeteria.
	   Armenia's President Robert Kocharian and Prime Minister Armen
Darbinian have sent condolences to the victims' families.

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Space shuttle Endeavour and its crew
of six blazed a brilliant trail into orbit Friday, taking off on
the first construction flight of the international space station.
	   ``Let's go do this,'' said commander Robert Cabana, who along
with his crew waited a full year for this day.
	   ``Amen,'' a launch controller replied.
	   The entire sky flashed when Endeavour's boosters ignited at 3:35
a.m. The shuttle shone like a bright star and was visible for more
than seven minutes as it sped out over the Atlantic and up the East
Coast.
	   Eight minutes into the flight, Endeavour was cruising in orbit,
bound for a Sunday rendezvous with the first space station
component launched by the Russians. The component had just passed
over Cape Canaveral when the shuttle blasted off. The full moon
gleamed as the chase began.
	   Endeavour is carrying Part 2, an American-built connecting
passageway that the astronauts will attach to the piece that
preceded them into orbit by two weeks.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was among the dignitaries
from around the world who returned for Endeavour's second launch
attempt. The first, on Thursday, was scrapped when the master alarm
in the shuttle cockpit went off with just 4{ minutes remaining in
the countdown. This time, the alarm behaved.
	   Another alarm sounded, however, soon after Endeavour reached
orbit. One of three hydraulic power units overheated, and the
pilots switched to a backup controller to cool it before shutting
down each unit as planned. Mission Control said engineers were
looking into the problem but did not expect it to impact the 12-day
flight.
	   Albright congratulated the launch team after witnessing her
first shuttle launch.
	   ``In foreign policy, we have our version of launches and we
don't get it right the second time often, so all my admiration to
you,'' she said. She also plugged the space station: ``As secretary
of state, all day long I deal with disputes on the ground,
countries that can't get along, and it's great to look at this
space station endeavor.''
	   Sixteen countries have teamed up to build the outpost in the
sky, one year late in the making because of a cash crunch in Russia
that has stalled work on a crucial control module.
	   Forty-three more U.S. and Russian launches will be needed over
the next five years to haul up space station parts. And 162
spacewalks will be required to put all the pieces together and keep
them maintained; the first three are slated for Endeavour's flight.
	   Once the first two components are connected with the help of
Endeavour's robot arm and thrusters _ the hardest job of the
mission, according to the crew _ Jerry Ross and James Newman will
go out to join all the electrical connections and cables by hand.
They'll also attach handrails and other tools for future crews.
	   ``The missions don't get any easier than ours,'' Cabana said of
the assembly flights to come. ``Many of them are a lot more
difficult so it's a learning experience.''
	   NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin expects ``some white-knuckled
times'' over the next several years.
	   ``This is going to be tough and we're going to have problems''
Goldin said Friday. ``But we have to go where exactly we want to
be.''
	   Astronauts won't be back to the fledgling station, once it's
released from Endeavour, until May 1999. And astronauts and
cosmonauts won't move in until early 2000; that's assuming the
Russians launch their oft-delayed and still unfinished command
module next summer. NASA has funneled $60 million to the Russians
to ensure its completion, and millions more may be needed.
	   The bailout irks Ralph DeGennaro, executive director of the
politically independent group Taxpayers for Common Sense. He said
in a statement following Thursday's postponement that ``NASA should
not just delay but actually cancel the most costly manned space
program in the history of humankind.''
	   As for the one-day delay, which cost NASA $600,000, engineers
traced the alarm to a sensitive switch in Endeavour's hydraulic
power system.

Czech activists protest pig farm on former Roma concentration camp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Renowned Nazi hunter Simon
Wiesenthal is among those demanding the removal of a pig farm from
the site of a World War II concentration camp for the Roma people,
Czech media reported Friday.
	   Wiesenthal, Prague Rabbi Karold Sidon and more than 100 others
sent a letter to the government last week calling for the
demolition of the pig farm built by the former communist regime and
privatized in 1994.
	   ``We regard the ... pig farm at the site as a desecration of a
monument to the victims as well as an insult to humanity,''
protester Pavel Theiner told the CTK news agency.
	   ``The government has 30 days,'' said Cenek Ruzicka, a descendant
of one of the victims of the concentration camp which held solely
Roma, or Gypsies, in the southern Czech Republic.
	   ``If they do nothing we will put strong pressure on them,'' he
said.
	   More than 300 Roma died in 1942 and 1943 in the camp near the
town of Pisek, 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Prague. Other
Roma were sent to Auschwitz.
	   Government spokesman Libor Roucek said the Cabinet was aware of
the activists' concerns and will examine the issue.
	   ``The government realizes how sensitive the issue is, but we
have to consider the (pig farm) owners' rights as well,'' Roucek
said, ``eventually some sort of removal will probably take place.''
	   A caretaker administration that governed the country for six
months before 1998 elections decided to remove the farm, but had no
time to enact the promise.

Russia criticizes arrest of Serb general accused of war crimes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia on Friday criticized the arrest by NATO-led
troops of a Serb general accused of war crimes, saying the case
should have been handled without NATO interference.
	   Arrests and trials of any suspects accused of war crimes in
Bosnia should be settled ``only via direct cooperation between the
Bosnian sides themselves and the International Tribunal on the
former Yugoslavia,'' the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a
statement quoted by the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies.
	   Gen. Radislav Krstic was seized by U.S. members of the NATO
peacekeeping force on Wednesday. He is the most senior Serb
military officer arrested so far in the effort to bring to trial
Bosnians accused of war crimes.
	   A U.N. indictment said Krstic commanded the soldiers who
executed thousands of Muslims and dumped them in mass graves.
	   Krstic arrived late Thursday in The Hague, where the Yugoslav
war crimes tribunal will try him for genocide, war crimes, crimes
against humanity and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions.
	   ``Russia has never objected to the fair punishment of people who
had committed war crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina,'' the Russian
Foreign Ministry's statement read.
	   But the ministry urged ``all parties to the international
settlement to act reasonably and cautiously, avoiding steps that
are apt to aggravate the situation and are fraught with unfavorable
consequences for the promotion of the peace process.''
	   The U.N. indictment alleges that troops under Krstic's command
committed offenses after the rebel Serb takeover of the U.N. safe
haven of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia in July 1995.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian ruble tumbled today, trading at about
20 to the U.S. dollar and threatening to hit its lowest point since
the country's economic crisis struck in August.
	   The ruble's latest slide is an ominous sign for the government,
which desperately wants to stabilize the economy as Russia heads
into the difficult winter months.
	   With President Boris Yeltsin hospitalized, and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov still struggling to implement a recovery plan, the
economy continues to founder and remains vulnerable to additional
shocks.
	   Primakov said the government would not attempt to fix the ruble
rate and would continue to let dollars circulate freely in Russia.
He acknowledged the crisis had left the government with few good
options.
	   ``The government has found it has less room to maneuver in these
conditions than it had a year or two ago,'' Primakov told a session
of the World Economic Forum in Moscow.
	   He blamed previous governments for the country's economic
turmoil and said a lack of stability, as well as the loss of
confidence in the country's future, had jeopardized economic reform
efforts.
	   Primakov's government is urgently seeking foreign help, but
International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus came and left
this week without giving any signal that a frozen loan package will
be released soon.
	   The Clinton administration is sending a group of economics and
foreign policy specialists to Moscow for consultations next week.
The State Department said the trip was part of a regular pattern of
talks with Russian officials.
	   With the country's financial markets essentially wiped out by
the economic crisis, the value of the ruble is one of the leading
indicators of economic confidence.
	   After stabilizing temporarily at about 16 to the dollar, it has
been falling in recent days. The official rate was down from 18.8
on Thursday to 19.6 today, and in street trading it took more than
20 rubles to purchase one U.S. dollar.
	   The ruble dipped below 20 to the dollar shortly after the
country's economic crisis hit in August, before making a modest
comeback. The ruble was at about 6 to the dollar before the crisis.
	   Meanwhile, the government announced inflation has gone up more
than 65 percent so far this year and is expected to top 70 percent
by year's end.
	   If the government does not receive foreign assistance soon, it
is expected to start printing more rubles to pay off millions of
workers and pensioners who haven't received their money for months.
	   But the additional money is almost certain to push inflation
higher and could bring back the hyperinflation that Russia suffered
during the early 1990s.
	   Primakov, meanwhile, met with Yeltsin in the hospital today and
advised him to make a full recovery before returning to the
Kremlin, the president's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said.
	   Yeltsin was admitted to the hospital on Nov. 22, and Yakushkin
declined to say when he might be released.

Parliament urges Moscow city to restore statue of dreaded police

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ It inspired, even comforted, Communists, and
terrified democrats and human rights activists.
	   The statue of infamous Soviet secret police chief Felix
Dzerzhinsky loomed before the KGB headquarters until it was toppled
by euphoric pro-democracy protesters in 1991. Seven years after
Russia became a democracy, the Communist-dominated Russian
parliament formally approved a measure Friday calling for the
statue's resurrection.
	   The measure passed 255-102 after two heated debates that
reflected the chasm between those who champion the Soviet collapse
and the Communists and other hard-liners who view the Soviet era
fondly _ and bitterly lament Russia's post-Soviet decline.
	   The document says the restored statue would be a ``symbol of the
fight against crime in Russia.''
	   Crime has become a major problem in post-Soviet Russia, with
official corruption, organized crime, murders and violent robberies
a pervasive part of life. Russians, including many who do not
support the Communists, are deeply unhappy about the lawlessness
and several political parties have tried to harness that
discontent.
	   ``Replacing the statue will reassure the nation,'' Nikolai
Kharitonov, leader of the Communist-allied Agrarian Party, said
when the measure was first proposed Wednesday.
	   Russia's beleaguered reformers see Dzerzhinsky as a criminal
himself.
	   ``Dzerzhinsky was one of the most horrible butchers in history,
with a multitude of innocent victims on his conscience,'' said
lawmaker Yuri Rybakov, a member of the Russia's Democratic Choice
party. ``How can we possibly reinstate his statue?''
	   The Duma's resolution, which is non-binding, urges the Moscow
city government to restore the monument. But the city legislature _
where Communists are far less influential than they are in the
national parliament _ must approve all such decisions.
	   Moscow's powerful Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a leading presidential
hopeful, said Friday he opposed restoring the statue _ but also
said he had opposed its initial removal.
	   ``We will not look very good if we stand before the world as a
system that takes down monuments, then restores them, then takes
them down again and restores them again,'' he was quoted by the
Interfax news agency as saying.
	   The towering bronze statue of ``Iron Felix,'' head of the first
secret police organization in the Soviet era, was a major Moscow
landmark for decades.
	   In one of the most enduring images of the defeated hard-line
coup against Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev in August 1991,
five giant cranes pulled down the 14-ton statue. Thousands of
onlookers cheered and clambered over the prone monument, denouncing
the KGB's role in decades of repression.
	   The statue has since languished with other Soviet-era statues in
a city park.
	   Lyubyanka Square is now used by human rights groups for vigils
to honor the millions of victims of Soviet rule. Relatives of
victims of Soviet-era purges whose remains were never found use the
square as a symbolic gravesite, bringing flowers every year.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Friday
that the president didn't take the parliament's decision seriously
as a legal document. But ``on an emotional level it is difficult to
expect a person who spearheaded democratic reforms to support a
monument'' that for many people symbolizes political repression,
Yakushkin said.
	   Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the liberal Yabloko faction, said
Friday: ``It's now clear that all Communist talk about being a new,
reformed party is a cynical lie.''
	   ``If they come to power in Russia, they would use the same
methods this man (Dzerzhinsky) used _ physical extermination of
their opponents. Their ideal of justice is summary executions in
the basements.''
	   Yabloko members also proposed an end to the state financing of
Vladimir Lenin's embalmed body and his mausoleum on Red Square. The
motion was overwhelmingly defeated.

Russian ruble tumbles, Primakov warns of `permanent' crisis

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The sinking ruble headed toward its lowest level
since a financial meltdown this summer, and Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov warned Friday that the country's reforms were imperiled by
the shrinking economy.
	   Primakov's government desperately wants to stabilize the economy
as Russia heads into the difficult winter months. But with
President Boris Yeltsin hospitalized and Primakov struggling to
implement a recovery plan, the economy is still foundering and
susceptible to additional shocks.
	   ``If there is no social and economic stability in Russia ...
then any (further) reforms are out of the question,'' Primakov told
a session of the the World Economic Forum, a Swiss-based
organization.
	   Primakov stressed that the government was still committed to
market reforms, and noted that it had not intervened to fix the
ruble rate or restrict the flow of dollars, as some had suggested.
	   But he acknowledged that the loss of confidence in the economy
had given the government little room to maneuver.
	   ``In such conditions, the crisis can become permanent,'' he
said. ``But the worst consequences of the crisis aren't the fall of
the ruble, or the drop in production, but a total crisis of
confidence between creditors and debtors, owners and managers, the
government and the population.''
	   Russia is urgently seeking foreign help, but International
Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus came and left this week
without giving any signal that a frozen loan package will be
released soon.
	   Until the IMF acts, other foreign lenders are unlikely to give
Russia the infusion of cash it needs to pay workers, pensioners and
foreign creditors.
	   The country's financial markets have effectively been wiped out
by the economic crisis, which hit Russia in August after first
ravaging many Asian economies last year.
	   In this environment, the ruble is one of the leading indicators
of economic confidence, and it is again on the decline. Many blame
its fall on concerns that the government is printing money to pay
huge wage debts _ a move almost certain to push up inflation.
	   After stabilizing for a few weeks at about 16 to the dollar, the
ruble has been falling in recent days. The official rate was down
from 18.8 on Thursday to 19.6 on Friday, and in street trading it
took more than 20 rubles to purchase one U.S. dollar.
	   The ruble dipped below 20 to the dollar shortly after the
country's economic crisis hit in August before making a modest
comeback. The ruble was at about 6 to the dollar before the crisis.
	   Meanwhile, the government announced that inflation is up more
than 65 percent so far this year and is expected to top 70 percent
by year's end.
	   Russian inflation had been coming down after years of soaring
prices and was expected to be in single digits this year until the
country's economic crisis hit.
	   If the government does not receive foreign assistance soon, it
has said it would print more rubles to pay off millions of workers
who haven't received their money for months.

Russia's strategic forces to receive new nuclear missiles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's strategic missile forces will be equipped
with 10 new Topol-M ballistic nuclear missiles before the end of
the year, a senior official said Friday.
	   ``Literally today or tomorrow, the last missile manufactured
this year goes to the location site,'' First Deputy Prime Minister
Yuri Maslyukov told the staff of Moscow's Heat Engineering
Institute.
	   The Topol-M is the first new ballistic nuclear missile to be
deployed by Russia in several years and is intended to form the
country's main nuclear deterrent. It is a relatively small, rugged
missile designed to be fired from trucks or other vehicles, making
it difficult for potential enemies to succeed with a first strike
in a nuclear confrontation.
	   The missile force has been struggling to maintain its
effectiveness at a time when the military lacks funds and equipment
because of the country's economic crisis. The force's older
missiles are wearing out rapidly and only a few Topols have been
built as replacements.
	   Defense spending will equal 3.5 percent of gross domestic
product in 1999, Maslyukov was quoted by the ITAR-Tass news agency
as saying. He added that once the economic crisis abates, Russia
may be able to start manufacturing about 40 Topol missiles each
year. So far, the crisis has shown no sign of ending.
	   Russian military commanders have devoted much of their limited
funding to maintaining the nuclear forces, one of the few factors
that boosts Moscow's claim to be a global power. The government
insists more money must be found to modernize the nuclear forces
despite the economic crisis.
	   Maslyukov said Russia needs to get rid of huge stockpiles of
aging or outdated weapons _ and therefore should ratify the START
II arms reduction treaty with the United States.
	   ``We have nearly 6,000 warheads, but in the face of powerful
countermeasures, only hundreds of them will hit enemy targets. In
this light, ratification is a way to reduce the surplus, to
concentrate what little resources we have on the most important
projects,'' Maslyukov said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   START II, which was signed in 1993, would halve Russian and
American nuclear arsenals to about 3,500 warheads each. The U.S.
Senate ratified it in 1996, but the Communist-led opposition in the
Russian parliament has balked.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's cash-strapped missile forces have designed a
cheap method for getting rid of old nuclear missiles _ by launching
them.
	   The Scalpel missiles would be launched without nuclear warheads,
and their trajectory would be calculated so that they use up all
their fuel and then burn in the atmosphere, missile force press
service said, according to Interfax.
	   However, the service life of the missiles has expired, and
engineers are no longer sure whether the missiles will accurately
follow their programmed trajectory.
	   Storing the missiles is dangerous and expensive, the missile
force said.

3 die in explosion at Russian army depot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ At least one explosion rocked an army storage
depot in Russia's Ural Mountains on Friday, killing three men, news
reports said.
	   Another man was injured but rejected medical aid and fled, Lt.
Gen. Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, chief of staff for the Urals military
district, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying. Police
were searching for the man.
	   One of the dead was a retired colonel and the other two were
civilians who worked as guards at the depot in Yekaterinburg, about
1,500 kilometers (900 miles) east of Moscow.
	   The cause of the explosion was unclear. Earlier reports said
several blasts ripped through a repair shop at the depot that
contained bags of gunpowder.

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ President Alexander Lukashenko has
unexpectedly merged three of his government ministries under one
roof and appointed his adviser to head them, the presidential press
service said Friday.
	   Lukashenko ordered that the Foreign Economic Ministry and the
ministry for relations with former Soviet republics be incorporated
into the Foreign Ministry, Belarusian state television reported,
citing presidential press service.
	   The heads of the three ministries have been fired. Lukashenko
appointed his foreign policy adviser and ex-KGB officer Ural
Latypov to head the expanded Foreign Ministry.
	   Lukashenko, an eccentric and authoritarian leader, gave no
reason for what his decree called a ``reorganization'' of the
government.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A passenger plane was hijacked Friday in southern
Russia, Russia's NTV television reported.
	   The hijackers' demands were unclear. The plane was traveling
from the Siberian city of Omsk to the southern Russian city of
Krasnodar.
	   Dozens of riot troops, fire engines and police gathered at the
Krasnodar airport, NTV said.
	   No other details were immediately available.
	   Airport security has worsened in Russia since the Soviet Union
fell apart in 1991. Hijackers have targeted domestic flights a

Chief U.N. weapons inspector in Russia to discuss Iraq

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.N. inspectors may finish reviewing Iraq's
weapons programs within weeks, Russia's foreign minister said
Friday after talks with the chief U.N. inspector.
	   ``It is hard to talk about breakthroughs,'' Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov said, according to the Interfax news agency. But ``we
can claim with confidence that we are at the end of the road.'' He
did not elaborate.
	   Visiting chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler discussed
the Iraqi crisis with Ivanov and other top Russian officials
Friday.
	   The Russian government has staunchly opposed the use of force
against Iraq, while urging Iraq to fully cooperate with U.N weapons
inspectors.
	   Ivanov called his two-hour meeting with Butler ``very
constructive.''
	   Butler, who heads the U.N. Special Commission charged with
making sure Iraq dismantles its weapons of mass destruction, also
met with Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk, who oversees
Iraq and other Mideast countries.
	   Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is expected to arrive in
Moscow on Sunday for a four-day visit that will include a meeting
with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, the Russian Foreign Ministry
said in a statement Friday.
	   On Thursday, Aziz accused U.N. weapons inspectors of providing
enemy intelligence agencies with information obtained from its
weapons searches. Aziz called on U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to stop such contacts.
	   Aziz and the Russians will discuss the situation in Iraq,
``particularly in the context of a comprehensive review by the U.N.
Security Council of the fulfillment of its resolutions by
Baghdad,'' the statement said.
	   The U.N. weapons inspectors must certify that Iraq has complied
with U.N. resolutions calling for the dismantling of the country's
nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and long-range missiles
before the Security Council can lift crippling economic sanctions
imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Baghdad has accused the Special Commission of working on behalf
of the United States to prolong the sanctions.
	   Iraq's recent refusal to cooperate with weapons inspectors
prompted the United States and Britain to threaten a military
strike. Responding to the threat, Iraq agreed Nov. 14 to resume
cooperation with weapons inspectors.
	   Moscow, which is owed billions of dollars from Iraq in debt left
over from Soviet times, is generally sympathetic to the Arab nation
and has called for an early lifting of the sanctions.

A toppled statue to rise again in Moscow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos MOSB113,NY191 &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGELA CHARLTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The statue of Soviet secret police chief Felix
Dzerzhinsky loomed before KGB headquarters for years, inspiring
Communists and terrifying human rights activists until it was
toppled by euphoric pro-democracy protesters in 1991.
	   Some lawmakers want to raise him up again.
	   Seven years after Russia became a democracy, the
Communist-dominated parliament approved a measure Friday calling
for the resurrection of the statue that had been a major Moscow
landmark since the 1940s.
	   The measure passed 255-102 after two heated debates that
reflected the chasm between those who championed the Soviet
collapse and the Communists and other hard-liners who view the
Soviet era fondly _ and bitterly lament Russia's post-Soviet
decline.
	   The document says the restored statue would be a ``symbol of the
fight against crime in Russia.''
	   Crime has become a major problem in post-Soviet Russia, with
official corruption, organized crime, murders and violent robberies
a pervasive part of life. Russians of all persuasions are deeply
unhappy about the lawlessness and several political parties have
tried to harness that discontent.
	   ``Replacing the statue will reassure the nation,'' Nikolai
Kharitonov, leader of the Communist-allied Agrarian Party, said
when the measure was proposed Wednesday.
	   Russia's beleaguered reformers see Dzerzhinsky as a criminal
himself.
	   ``Dzerzhinsky was one of the most horrible butchers in history,
with a multitude of innocent victims on his conscience,'' said
lawmaker Yuri Rybakov, a member of the Russia's Democratic Choice
party. ``How can we possibly reinstate his statue?''
	   The Duma's resolution, which is non-binding, urges the Moscow
city government to restore the monument. But the city legislature _
where Communists are far less influential _ must approve all such
decisions.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a leading presidential hopeful, said
Friday that he opposed restoring the statue _ just as he had
opposed its initial removal.
	   ``We will not look very good if we stand before the world as a
system that takes down monuments, then restores them, then takes
them down again and restores them again,'' he was quoted by the
Interfax news agency as saying.
	   It was not known how many city lawmakers supported the project.
	   The towering bronze statue of ``Iron Felix'' honored the man who
was head of the first secret police organization in the Soviet era.
	   In one of the most enduring images of the failed hard-line coup
against Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991, five giant
cranes pulled down the 14-ton statue. Thousands cheered and
clambered over the prone monument, denouncing the KGB's role in
decades of repression.
	   The statue has since languished with other Soviet-era statues in
a city park.
	   Lyubyanka Square, where the statue used to stand, is now used
for vigils to honor the millions of victims of Soviet rule.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, said
Friday that the president didn't take the parliament's decision
seriously.
	   ``It is difficult to expect a person who spearheaded democratic
reforms to support a monument'' that for many symbolizes political
repression, Yakushkin said.
	   Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the liberal Yabloko faction, said the
measure showed the Communists' true colors.
	   ``It's now clear that all Communist talk about being a new,
reformed party is a cynical lie,'' he said. ``If they come to power
in Russia, they would use the same methods this man used _ physical
extermination of their opponents. Their ideal of justice is summary
executions in the basements.''
	   But Yabloko members also proposed ending state funding for
Vladimir Lenin's embalmed body and his mausoleum on Red Square _ a
motion that was overwhelmingly defeated.

Summers, Talbott to Moscow

 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With the Russian ruble tumbling and President
Boris Yeltsin's health uncertain, the Clinton administration is
sending economics and foreign policy specialists to Moscow for
consultations with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and his economic
advisers.
	   ``It's no secret we are concerned about the situation in
Russia,'' State Department deputy spokesman James Foley said
Friday, adding that the United States will support Russia only if
it grapples with its problems.
	   Such reforms as a modern banking system, payments to creditors
and a fight against inflation will top the U.S. agenda, Foley said.
	   Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott plan to head the U.S. delegation for the
talks in Moscow Dec. 10-12. With them will be Leon Fuerth, who
assists Vice President Al Gore on foreign policy issues.
	   A State Department announcement said next week's trip was part
of a regular pattern of talks with Russian government officials.
	   In Moscow, Yeltsin is hospitalized and Primakov is struggling to
implement a recovery plan. Foley said he did not expect a meeting
with Yeltsin.
	   President Clinton made clear when he traveled to Moscow three
months ago that Russia should not expect any additional economic
assistance unless it adopted at least a rudimentary system of
banking and loan payments.
	   Talbott, meanwhile, warned a month ago that Western oil
companies would not invest in long-term projects unless Russia
adopted a clear tax system, secured property rights and showed a
willingness to take disputes to international arbitration.
	   Russian industry needs outside investments of close to $15
billion a year just to return to Soviet-era production levels,
Talbott told a conference at Stanford University.
	   Primakov was operating without a realistic budget or a credible
system for collecting taxes, he said, adding: ``Economic decline
carries with it the danger of political drift, turmoil and even
crackup.'' Hard-line nationalists and communists have gained
support during Russia's hard times.
	   Still, the Clinton administration plans to proceed with further
meetings of a joint U.S.-Russian commission on cooperation in
economics and technology.

Russian ruble tumbles, Primakov warns of `permanent' crisis
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian ruble sunk toward its lowest level
since a financial meltdown this summer, prompting Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov to warn Friday that the country's reforms are
being imperiled by its shrinking economy.
	   Primakov's government desperately wants to stabilize the economy
as Russia heads into the difficult winter months. But with
President Boris Yeltsin hospitalized and Primakov struggling to
implement a recovery plan, the economy is still foundering and
susceptible to additional shocks.
	   ``If there is no social and economic stability in Russia ...
then any (further) reforms are out of the question,'' Primakov told
the World Economic Forum, a Swiss-based organization.
	   Primakov stressed that the government was still committed to
market reforms and noted that it had not intervened to fix the
ruble rate or restrict the flow of dollars, as some had suggested.
	   But he acknowledged that the loss of confidence in the economy
had given the government little room to maneuver.
	   ``In such conditions, the crisis can become permanent,'' he
said. ``But the worst consequences of the crisis aren't the fall of
the ruble, or the drop in production, but a total crisis of
confidence between creditors and debtors, owners and managers, the
government and the population.''
	   Russia is urgently seeking foreign help, but International
Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus came and left this week
without giving any signal that a frozen loan package will be
released soon.
	   Until the IMF acts, other foreign lenders are unlikely to give
Russia the infusion of cash it needs to pay workers, retirees and
foreign creditors.
	   Next week, senior U.S. officials including Deputy Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott plan will be in Moscow for long-planned talks on economic
and other topics Dec. 10-12.
	   Russia's financial markets have effectively been wiped out by
the economic crisis, which hit in August after first ravaging many
Asian economies last year.
	   In this environment, the ruble is one of the leading indicators
of economic confidence. Many blame its renewed fall on concerns
that the government is printing money to pay huge wage debts _ a
move almost certain to push up inflation.
	   After stabilizing for a few weeks at about 16 to the dollar, the
ruble has been falling in recent days. The official rate was down
from 18.8 on Thursday to 19.6 on Friday, and in street trading it
took more than 20 rubles to purchase one U.S. dollar.
	   The ruble dipped below 20 to the dollar shortly after the
country's economic crisis hit in August before making a modest
comeback. It stood at 6 to the dollar before the crisis.
	   Meanwhile, the government announced that inflation is up more
than 65 percent this year and is expected to top 70 percent by
year's end.
	   Russian inflation had been coming down after years of soaring
prices and was expected to be in the single digits this year until
the economic crisis hit.
	   If the government does not receive foreign assistance soon, it
says it will have to print more rubles to pay off millions of
workers who haven't received their salaries for months.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A passenger plane that had reportedly been
hijacked landed safely in southern Russia on Friday, emergency
officials said.
	   Security agents combed the plane for explosives, and all the
passengers disembarked, said Vasily Yurchuk, spokesman for Russia's
Emergencies Ministry.
	   The airport in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar had
apparently received a phone threat saying there was a bomb aboard
the plane, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Dozens of riot troops, fire engines and police gathered to meet
it when it landed Friday night, Russia's NTV television reported.
	   But Yurchuk said no hijacker was found on the plane.
	   The plane was traveling from the Siberian city of Omsk to
Krasnodar.
	   Airport security has worsened in Russia since the Soviet Union
fell apart in 1991. Hijackers have targeted domestic flights
several times, but in most cases have given up after negotiating
with authorities.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A passenger plane that had reportedly been
hijacked landed safely in southern Russia on Friday, emergency
officials said.
	   Security agents combed the Tu-154 for explosives and searched
all the passengers, but found no bomb and no hijacker, said a
police spokesman in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar.
	   The airport in the Siberian city of Omsk, where the plane
departed from, received a phone threat saying there was a bomb
aboard the plane after it was airborne, the spokesman said. He
would not give his name.
	   Dozens of riot troops, fire engines and police gathered at the
Krasnodar airport to meet the plane when it landed Friday night,
Russia's NTV television reported.
	   It was unclear how many passengers were aboard or whether they
knew of the bomb threat.
	   Airport security has worsened in Russia since the Soviet Union
fell apart in 1991. Hijackers have targeted domestic flights
several times, but in most cases have given up after negotiating
with authorities.

Chief U.N. weapons inspector in Russia to discuss Iraq

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ U.N. arms inspectors may finish reviewing Iraq's
weapons programs within weeks, Russia's foreign minister said
Friday after talks with the chief U.N. weapons inspector.
	   ``It is hard to talk about breakthroughs,'' Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov said, according to the Interfax news agency. But ``we
can claim with confidence that we are at the end of the road.'' He
did not elaborate.
	   Richard Butler, who heads the U.N. Special Commission that is
charged with ensuring Iraq dismantles its weapons of mass
destruction, discussed the Iraqi crisis with Ivanov and other top
Russian officials Friday.
	   The Russian government has staunchly opposed the use of force
against Iraq, while urging the nation to fully cooperate with U.N
weapons inspectors.
	   Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is expected to arrive
Sunday in Moscow for a four-day visit that will include a meeting
with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, the Russian Foreign Ministry
said Friday.
	   Aziz and the Russians will discuss the situation in Iraq,
``particularly in the context of a comprehensive review by the U.N.
Security Council of the fulfillment of its resolutions by
Baghdad,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
	   The U.N. weapons inspectors must certify that Iraq has complied
with U.N. resolutions calling for the dismantling of the country's
nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and long-range missiles
before the Security Council can lift crippling economic sanctions
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   The Iraqi government has accused the weapons inspectors of
working on behalf of the United States to prolong the sanctions.
	   Iraq's recent refusal to cooperate with inspectors prompted the
United States and Britain to threaten a military strike. Iraq
agreed Nov. 14 to resume cooperation with weapons inspectors.
	   Moscow, which is owed billions of dollars from Iraq in debt left
over from Soviet times, is generally sympathetic to the Arab nation
and has called for an early lifting of the sanctions.

Documentary marking Solzhenitsyn's 80th birthday canceled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian television station canceled plans Friday
to air a documentary marking the 80th birthday of Nobel laureate
and Soviet dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn after he objected.
	   The film, called ``The Chosen One,'' was to air on Russia's RTR
television Friday, the 25th anniversary of the first publication of
his renowned work ``The Gulag Archipelago.''
	   But less than two hours before its scheduled broadcast, the
station announced on its evening news that it had canceled the
showing.
	   RTR said it had sent Solzhenitsyn a copy of the tape for review,
but Solzhenitsyn said he had not seen the film and didn't want it
to air without his approval.
	   Russia's other two main television stations have also prepared
documentaries to mark his birthday, which is Dec. 11.
	   The ORT television station showed the first part of its
documentary, ``The Knot,'' on Friday. NTV will show its film, ``The
Life of Solzhenitsyn,'' next week.
	   Solzhenitsyn's works ``One Day in the Life of Ivan
Denisovitch,'' ``The Gulag Archipelago'' and ``Cancer Ward'' laid
bare cruelties and repressions of the Soviet system.
	   ``The Gulag Archipelago'' was first published in Paris in 1973,
and Solzhenitsyn was arrested and expelled from the Soviet Union
the following year. He lived in Vermont for 18 years, then returned
to Russia in 1994.
	   He enjoyed much more influence as a dissident than he does
today. He is fiercely critical of post-Soviet Russia, but many find
his proposed solutions to be overly conservative, nationalistic or
irrelevant.
	   He won the Nobel prize for literature in 1970.

 &UR; Eds: To UPDATE with Talbott interview, INSERTS 3 grafs after 5th

 &UR; With AM-Russia-Economy &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC;

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With the Russian ruble tumbling and President
Boris Yeltsin's health uncertain, the Clinton administration is
sending economics and foreign policy specialists to Moscow for
consultations with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and his economic
advisers.
	   ``It's no secret we are concerned about the situation in
Russia,'' State Department deputy spokesman James Foley said
Friday, adding that the United States will support Russia only if
it grapples with its problems.
	   Such reforms as a modern banking system, payments to creditors
and a fight against inflation will top the U.S. agenda, Foley said.
	   Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott plan to head the U.S. delegation for the
talks in Moscow Dec. 10-12. With them will be Leon Fuerth, who
assists Vice President Al Gore on foreign policy issues.
	   A State Department announcement said next week's trip was part
of a regular pattern of talks with Russian government officials.
	   ``We are going to listen, as well as to explain,'' Talbott told
The Associated Press. ``We want very much to take advantage of this
opportunity to hear from the prime minister and key members of his
economic team how they see the situation and the challenge.''
	   Talbott said Russian leaders faced a ``profound dilemma,''
needing international support while recognizing ``they've got to
have an economic structure in place'' to attract investments.
	   At the same time, Talbott spoke positively about Russia's
future: ``Russia is a country with immense potential. Look at how
far they have come in a relatively short period of time against
immense odds.''
	   In Moscow, Yeltsin is hospitalized and Primakov is struggling to
implement a recovery plan. Foley said he did not expect a meeting
with Yeltsin.
	   President Clinton made clear when he traveled to Moscow three
months ago that Russia should not expect any additional economic
assistance unless it adopted at least a rudimentary system of
banking and loan payments.
	   Talbott, meanwhile, warned a month ago that Western oil
companies would not invest in long-term projects unless Russia
adopted a clear tax system, secured property rights and showed a
willingness to take disputes to international arbitration.
	   Russian industry needs outside investments of close to $15
billion a year just to return to Soviet-era production levels,
Talbott told a conference at Stanford University.
	   Primakov was operating without a realistic budget or a credible
system for collecting taxes, he said, adding: ``Economic decline
carries with it the danger of political drift, turmoil and even
crackup.'' Hard-line nationalists and communists have gained
support during Russia's hard times.
	   Still, the Clinton administration plans to proceed with further
meetings of a joint U.S.-Russian commission on cooperation in
economics and technology.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two people have been reported missing at sea in
the Russian Far East, a news agency reported Saturday.
	   A ferryboat passenger was reported missing Friday while the
vessel Sakhalin-7 crossed the Tatar Strait in the Khabarovsk
territory, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   A search for the missing passenger was called off after 24
hours, the Vladivostok marine rescue center said, according to
ITAR-Tass.
	   A seaman on the fishing trawler Oboyan disappeared Friday while
the craft was en route to Russia from Japan, the news agency said.
A search was being conducted by other fishing boats in the region.

Russia's second city holds election marred by violence, dirty
</HEADLINE>
tactics &QL; 
 &UR; By ALICE LAGNADO &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ St. Petersburg was at the
forefront of this country's democracy movement a decade ago, but as
it heads into city elections Sunday, its politics are now
considered as dirty and deadly as anywhere in Russia.
	   Last month's killing of Galina Starovoitova, the country's most
prominent female politician, drew international condemnation and
focused attention on St. Petersburg, a city that has failed to meet
its high expectations in the post-Soviet era.
	   The run-up to the election has been marred by several contract
killings of politicians and leading businessmen, beatings and
drive-by shootings against candidates and frequent reports of dirty
tricks by campaigners.
	   ``Five years ago we could hardly imagine that elections to the
St. Petersburg Legislative Assembly would include threats,
blackmail and assault,'' the head of Russia's Federal Security
Service, Vladimir Putin, said in an interview with the newspaper
Peterburgsky Chas Pik.
	   Boris Nemtsov, the former first deputy premier, recently visited
the city and called it ``the crime capital of Russia.''
	   In this atmosphere, 587 candidates are competing for 50 seats in
the city assembly. Unlike many cities in Russia, where the city
legislature has little power, this body could be quite influential.
	   A new city charter, introduced this year after a bitter battle,
calls for the legislature to be a full-time body with extensive
powers.
	   Gov. Alexander Yakovlev _ the city's mayor despite his title _
strongly opposed the new charter, which curtails his clout.
	   Yakovlev is not on the ballot and has not been actively
campaigning for individual candidates. But critics say the powerful
Yakovlev has contributed to the mean-spirited atmosphere
surrounding the election.
	   Prominent liberal politicians opposed to Yakovlev have found
that people who share the same name were mysteriously proposed as
candidates. This has been done in an attempt to confuse voters and
take away votes from liberals.
	   For example, when voters go to the polls, there will be two
``Sergei Belyayevs'' on the ballot. Voters may be hard-pressed to
determine which one is the well-known liberal and which one is the
anonymous decoy candidate.
	   In addition, anti-Semitic leaflets have been handed out asking
citizens not to vote for Jewish candidates, and one candidate's
posters were defaced with slurs against Jews.
	   There have also been multiple reports of attempts to bribe
voters.
	   Pensioners have reportedly been taken on ``free excursions'' _
bus rides with presents and free vodka _ which end at a polling
station where the retirees are told that the trip was sponsored by
a certain candidate whom they were asked to vote for.
	   St. Petersburg's 3.7 million voters seem fed up with the city's
crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance, but it's
not clear that they will turn out in large numbers.
	   St. Petersburg, which is Russia's second-largest city after
Moscow, had seemed a likely candidate for prosperity in the
post-Soviet era.
	   It's been a liberal, Westward-leaning city ever since the
Russian Czar Peter the Great built it from scratch at the beginning
of the 18th century and dubbed it the country's ``window on the
West.''
	   St. Petersburg produced many of the country's democratic
reformers and free-market economists in the late 1980s and early
1990s, but the city has languished since then.
	   The murder of Starovoitova seemed to symbolize much of what's
gone wrong. No one has been arrested for the Nov. 20 killing of
Starovoitova, who was a member of the national legislature and was
not on Sunday's ballot.
	   But her movement, Northern Capital, was based in St. Petersburg
and is expected to make a solid showing. She was an outspoken
critic of political corruption, and the Russian media has
speculated that she was killed by political opponents.

Russia's foreign trade shrinking after crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's foreign trade is shrinking as a result of
the economic crisis it could take up to four years to return to
last year's level, the minister for trade said Saturday.
	   Trade Minister Georgy Gabunia told an international economic
forum that Russia's foreign trade turnover was currently at the
1995 level, and will amount to 83-84 percent of the trade level of
1997, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   He blamed the decline on the economic crisis, which hit Russia
in August and has clogged the banking system, and the crisis in
Asian economies last year.
	   Gabunia said even when the situation stabilizes, foreign trade
will grow at just 3-4 percent a year, and return to the 1997 levels
only in 2002 or 2003.
	   He said that in order to strengthen Russia's role in world
trade, the government must change customs legislation and simplify
import and export procedures to attract investors.

Russian patriarch calls for abolition of death penalty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church
Saturday called for the abolition of the death penalty in Russia.
	   Patriarch Alexy II told the Interfax news agency that Russia
``must finally arrive at the rejection of the death sentence.''
	   He said the church had always opposed the death penalty, despite
a surge in crime and ``the horrible sadistic murders which sometime
occur here.''
	   Russia promised to scrap the death penalty in January 1996 when
it joined the Council of Europe, a human rights organization.
Nonetheless, 92 people were executed before Yeltsin imposed a
moratorium on executions later that year.
	   Officials said this week that Russia may rescind its pledge to
ban capital punishment because of the country's soaring lawlessness
and crime.
	   Alexy, responding to the suggestion that the death penalty be
restored, said, ``it would be impermissible to return to the tragic
past which we went through in the 20s and 30s,'' the Interfax
report said.
	   With only a moratorium on executions, Russian courts have
continued handing down death sentences and about 1,000 people are
now on death row, according to the Amnesty International human
rights group.

Spokesman says Yeltsin ready to return, but doesn't say when
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin is ready to return to
work, his spokesman said Saturday, nearly two weeks after the
president was hospitalized with pneumonia.
	   What spokesman Dmitri Yakushkin didn't say, however, was exactly
when Yeltsin will return.
	   Since his hospitalization on Nov. 22, Yeltsin has hovered in the
deep background of Russia's political discourse, largely unseen and
unheard. His place at the center of national affairs has been taken
by his prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov.
	   In announcing Yeltsin's imminent return, Yakushkin tried to
restore some luster to the president's image, depicting him as an
active, well-connected executive even from his hospital bed _ an
image few Russians are likely to believe anymore.
	   Speaking on Echo Moscow radio, Yakushkin said Yeltsin ``remains
the most influential politician in the country, no matter what is
said about it.'' He noted that the president remains in control of
the device that would authorize a nuclear strike.
	   He described Yeltsin as someone who is ``full of energy, speaks
very brightly and works a lot.'' A desk in his hospital room is
heaped with working papers, and Yeltsin keeps fully abreast of
events in the country, the spokesman said.
	   He remarked that alcoholic beverages, for which the president is
known to have a weakness, are ``absolutely prohibited'' in the
hospital.
	   ``The president does not think about his early resignation,''
Yakushkin said. He added, that Yeltsin ``is closely watching sharp
or insulting statements made by certain politicians concerning his
actions.''
	   ``The president remembers all of them,'' Yakushkin said.
	   If true, that would attest to a powerful memory, since Yeltsin
has been insulted or slighted by a wide array of political figures
lately, from the Communist opposition to his own former allies in
the political center.
	   Many have urged his resignation, but Yeltsin has remained
adamant that he will remain in office until the end of his term in
2000.
	   The Kremlin had said last week that Yeltsin was expected back at
work on Monday, but Yakushkin has declined to confirm that or say
when the president will be released from the hospital.
	   Primakov visited Yeltsin on Friday and urged him to stay in the
hospital until he was better.

Aide to slain lawmaker says he wasn't carrying bag of cash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A young aide wounded in the attack that killed a
prominent Russian lawmaker denied Saturday that he was carrying a
bag of cash at the time of the shooting, a Russian news agency
reported.
	   Ruslan Linkov, recuperating in a St. Petersburg hospital, said
there had been reports suggesting he was carrying a bag of cash for
Galina Starovoitova when she was killed.
	   ``There was a can of caviar in that bag for her parents ... her
personal belongings and a book in English on interethnic
relations,'' Linkov told Echo Moscow radio, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency. ``There was nothing else in it.''
	   Starovoitova, one of the country's most outspoken liberal
political figures and a potential presidential candidate, was
killed Nov. 20 as she and Linkov walked up the stairs to her
apartment in St. Petersburg.
	   Police have announced no major breakthroughs in the case, but
many believe the motive was political and may have been connected
to Sunday's elections in St. Petersburg.

Russia's second city holds legislative elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Polls open 0500 gmt and close at 1900 gmt. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ More than 500 candidates Sunday
vied for 50 Legislative Assembly seats in an election preceded by
contract killings, beatings of candidates and and dirty tricks by
campaigners.
	   A total of 577 names were on the ballot and observers predicted
that none of the candidates would get the 51 percent of the vote
needed to win a seat in the assembly, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said. A second round of balloting was likely to be held Dec. 20, it
said.
	   In early morning voting, few residents were seen casting
ballots.
	   St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, was at the
forefront of this country's democracy movement a decade ago, but as
it headed into the elections, its politics appeared as dirty and
deadly as anywhere in Russia.
	   There have been several attacks on prominent figures, including
politicians and businessmen.
	   Last year, the city's deputy governor was gunned down on a
central St. Petersburg street. In the past two months, hitmen have
claimed the lives of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city
official and a prominent banker.
	   Last month's killing of Galina Starovoitova, the country's most
prominent female politician, drew international condemnation and
focused attention on St. Petersburg's crime problems.
	   Boris Nemtsov, the former first deputy premier, recently visited
the city and called it ``the crime capital of Russia.''
	   Unlike many cities in Russia, where the city legislature has
little power, the assembly could be quite influential. A new city
charter calls for the legislature to be a full-time body with
extensive powers.
	   Alexander Yakovlev, the city's mayor, strongly opposed the new
charter, which curtails his clout. He is not on the ballot, but
critics say he has contributed to the mean-spirited atmosphere
surrounding the election.
	   Opponents of Yakovlev have found that people with the same name
were mysteriously proposed as candidates. This has been done in an
attempt to confuse voters and take away votes from liberals.
	   In addition, anti-Semitic leaflets have been handed out asking
citizens not to vote for Jewish candidates, and one candidate's
posters were defaced with slurs against Jews.
	   There have also been multiple reports of attempts to bribe
voters.
	   St. Petersburg's 3.7 million voters seem fed up with the city's
crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance, and
election officials predicted that only 35 percent of the electorate
would turn out for Sunday's polling, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Some 5,000 police were deployed to ensure law and order during
the balloting, the news agency said. Before polls opened, police
examined 1,500 polling stations, looking for explosives or other
items that could disrupt voting, it said.

Russia keeps espionage investigation open on former Qualcomm
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; hofonmw &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ An attorney claims Russian officials are
extending their investigation into former Qualcomm engineer Richard
Bliss, who was briefly jailed last year on an espionage charge.
	   Russian officials informed the U.S. State Department that they
plan to continue their investigation for at least another four
months, Bliss' attorney Kim Roberts said Friday.
	   ``This means that Richard Bliss continues to be classified as a
spy and this matter is still hanging over his head,'' Roberts said.
	   Bliss, 30, went to the city of Rostov-on-Don, about 600 miles
south of Moscow, to install a phone system for the San Diego-based
Qualcomm Inc., a wireless communications company.
	   Russian authorities charged him with espionage because they said
he took land surveys of restricted sites using illegal satellite
receivers and brought the equipment into the country without
disclosing it to customs inspectors.
	   Bliss said he relied on Qualcomm to secure the correct permits
for the Global Positioning Systems equipment, which the company
told him to transport into the country in his suitcase.
	   GPS equipment is commonly used to make land surveys for cellular
phone systems, using satellites to pinpoint locations on the
Earth's surface.
	   While using the equipment, Bliss said he was followed by Russian
authorities, who later confiscated the equipment and jailed him as
a suspected American spy.
	   After pressure from Vice President Al Gore and the State
Department, Russian officials released Bliss after 12 days in jail
on the promise he would return to Russia for trial, if necessary.
He faces 20 years in prison, if convicted.
	   Last month, Bliss resigned from Qualcomm and sued the company
for negligence. He contends the company failed to file the proper
paperwork for the satellite equipment and didn't work hard enough
at helping him getting the charge dropped.
	   Qualcomm spokeswoman Christine Trimble has said the company
continues to work with Russian officials to get the charges
dropped, which they believe will happen soon.
	   The company also believes Bliss sued the company in ``an
opportunistic demand for money,'' Trimble said. The lawsuit seeks
unspecified damages, but Bliss' attorneys tried to negotiate a
settlement of $1 million with Qualcomm before filing the lawsuit,
she said.

After weeks of illness, Yeltsin returns to work
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two weeks after he was hospitalized with
pneumonia, President Boris Yeltsin returned to work in the Kremlin
Monday morning, a presidential spokesman said.
	   Yeltsin almost disappeared from sight when he entered a
government hospital Nov. 22 with pneumonia, the latest in a long
string of health problems in recent years for the Russian leader.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said during the weekend
that Yeltsin was feeling better and would return, adding that the
president was ``still the most influential politician in the
country, no matter what is said about it.''
	   Many of Yeltsin's opponents claim he hasn't been seriously
involved in national affairs for a long time and is no longer fit
to lead.
	   Despite calls for his resignation, Yeltsin and his doctors
insist that the president will serve out his term, which ends in
2000.
	   Presidential aides said last week that doctors were having a
hard time persuading Yeltsin to rest and recover completely from
his illness. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov appealed to Yeltsin to
stay in hospital and complete his recovery.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Coming back to work with a bang, President Boris
Yeltsin fired most of his top aides on Monday in his first working
day at the Kremlin after a two-week hospitalization with pneumonia.
	   Yeltsin dismissed Chief of Staff Valentin Yumashev and his
deputies Yuri Yarov, Mikhail Komissar and Yevgeny Savostyanov, a
Kremlin spokesman said.
	   Nikolai Bordyuzha, former secretary of the presidential security
council, was appointed the new chief of staff, while the other
posts remain vacant.
	   The Kremlin had no immediate comment on the sudden dismissals.
	   Yeltsin has a habit of unexpected and often unexplained
dismissals. The latest round of dismissals could reflect his
unhappiness over the way some aides handled his recent
hospitalization and their unusual candidness about the president's
health.
	   Yumashev and other Kremlin aides openly said that Yeltsin is too
weak to handle day-to-day affairs or to make foreign trips and
suggested he leave control of the economy to Prime Minister Yevgney
Primakov.
	   Yeltsin insists he has no serious health problems and that he

Yeltsin fires key aides during a brief visit from hospital

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Briefly returning to work with a bang, President
Boris Yeltsin fired most of his top aides on Monday during a quick
trip to the Kremlin and assumed personal control of two key
government agencies.
	   After just three hours at his office, Yeltsin returned to the
government hospital where he has been for the past two weeks. The
Kremlin shakeup removed several top aides who had publicly
questioned the president's health in recent weeks.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said the president would
remain in the hospital while he continued to be treated for
pneumonia. Asked when Yeltsin would be released, Yakushkin said it
would depend on the treatment and how long it took the president to
recover.
	   Yeltsin dismissed Chief of Staff Valentin Yumashev and his
deputies Yuri Yarov, Mikhail Komissar and Yevgeny Savostyanov.
	   Nikolai Bordyuzha, the secretary of the presidential security
council, was appointed the new chief of staff, while the other
posts remain vacant. Bordyuzha, who will serve in both posts, was
chief of the Border Guards before his appointment to the security
post earlier this year.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin had dismissed the aides because he was
not satisfied with their work. The president was particularly
unhappy over the Kremlin's handling of several recent incidents of
political extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist
deputy in the Russian parliament, he said.
	   ``That undermines confidence in the president, and in the
government as a whole and that is inadmissible in the current
difficult economic situation,'' the spokesman said.
	   Yeltsin has a habit of unexpected and often unexplained
dismissals. The latest round of dismissals was thought to reflect
Yeltsin's unhappiness over the aides' unusual candidness about his
health in recent weeks.
	   Yumashev and other Kremlin aides openly said that Yeltsin is too
weak to handle day-to-day affairs or to make foreign trips and
suggested he leave control of the economy and other current affairs
to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   The Russian media has said that the passive and defeatist aides
were further eroding Yeltsin's power. The dismissed aides handled
the workings of the Kremlin and the president's routine and had
considerable influence.
	   On Monday, Yeltsin said he will oversee the justice ministry and
tax police _ without replacing the actual heads. The move appeared
aimed at strengthening Yeltsin's authority at a time when there is
growing public unhappiness about endemic crime in Russian society.
	   A top democratic lawmaker, Galina Starovoitova, was murdered
last month in St. Petersburg in an apparent contract killing. Her
unexplained death outraged and shocked many Russian politicians and
ordinary people.
	   Yeltsin insists he has no serious health problems and that he
remains in control of the government.
	   Yeltsin had all but disappeared from sight when he entered a
government hospital Nov. 22 with pneumonia, the latest in a long
string of health problems in recent years for the Russian leader.
	   Many of Yeltsin's opponents claim he hasn't been seriously
involved in national affairs for a long time and is no longer fit
to lead.
	   Despite calls for his resignation, Yeltsin and his doctors
insist that the president will serve out his term, which ends in
2000.
	   Presidential aides said last week that doctors were having a
hard time persuading Yeltsin to rest and recover completely from
his illness. Primakov had appealed to Yeltsin to stay in hospital
and complete his recovery.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Briefly returning to work with a bang, President
Boris Yeltsin fired most of his top aides on Monday and assumed
personal control of two key government agencies during a surprise
foray into the Kremlin.
	   After just three hours at his office, Yeltsin returned to the
government hospital where he has been for the past two weeks. The
Kremlin shakeup removed several top aides who had publicly
questioned the president's health in recent weeks.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin was quoted by
presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin as telling the stupefied
aides.
	   The president will remain in the hospital as long as necessary
to fully recuperate from pneumonia, Yakushkin said. He refused to
say when Yeltsin will be released, adding that it would depend on
the treatment.
	   Yeltsin dismissed Chief of Staff Valentin Yumashev and his
deputies Yuri Yarov, Mikhail Komissar and Yevgeny Savostyanov.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff, while the
other posts remain vacant. Bordyuzha, who will serve in both posts,
was chief of the Border Guards before his appointment to the
security post earlier this year.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin had dismissed the aides because of their
failure to stem crime or respond to several incidents of political
extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist deputy in
the Russian parliament.
	   ``That undermines confidence in the president and in the
government as a whole, and that is inadmissible in the current
difficult economic situation,'' the spokesman said.
	   Yeltsin has a habit of unexpected and often unexplained
dismissals. The latest round of ousters was also thought to reflect
his unhappiness over the aides' unusual candidness about his health
in recent weeks.
	   Yumashev and other Kremlin aides openly said that Yeltsin is too
weak to handle day-to-day affairs or to make foreign trips and
suggested he leave control of the economy and other current affairs
to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   The Russian media has said that the passive and defeatist aides
were further eroding Yeltsin's power. The dismissed aides handled
the workings of the Kremlin and the president's routine and had
considerable influence.
	   ``The president wanted to show who is the boss,'' Alexander
Shokhin, the head of the moderate, pro-government Our Home Is
Russia parliament faction, told reporters. ``He's like a lion who
licked his wounds and now roared at those who thought he was
already out of the game.''
	   Ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky praised the president for
cleaning the Kremlin of what he described as corrupt, weak
``slime,'' while Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov added his support.
	   Communists have long assailed the aides fired by Yeltsin, but
their No. 2, Valentin Kuptsov, criticized Yeltsin anyway. ``After
every illness or holiday of the president we always expect
inexplicable personnel reshuffling,'' he said.
	   In his brief flurry of activity, Yeltsin also said he would
begin overseeing the justice ministry and tax police _ without
replacing the actual heads. The move is aimed at stepping up fight
against endemic corruption and other crime, Yakushkin said.
	   A top democratic lawmaker, Galina Starovoitova, was murdered
last month in St. Petersburg in an apparent contract killing. Her
unexplained death outraged and shocked many Russian politicians and
ordinary people.
	   Yakushkin denied that the move reflected Yeltsin's
dissatisfaction with Primakov's handling of the agencies, saying it
was intended to simply streamline the government. ``In the current
situation, the government must be like one fist,'' he added.
	   Yeltsin all but disappeared from sight when he entered a
government hospital Nov. 22 with pneumonia, the latest in a long
string of health problems in recent years for the Russian leader.
	   Many of Yeltsin's opponents claim he hasn't been seriously
involved in national affairs for a long time and is no longer fit
to lead.
	   Despite calls for his resignation, Yeltsin and his doctors
insist that the president will serve out his term, which ends in
2000.
	   Also Monday, Yeltsin replaced the head of a government
communications agency and set up a panel intended to streamline
Russia's arms trade.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ More than 500 candidates Sunday
vied for 50 Legislative Assembly seats in an election preceded by
contract killings, beatings of candidates and and dirty tricks by
campaigners.
	   A total of 577 names were on the ballot and observers predicted
that none of the candidates were likely to get the 51 percent of
the votes cast needed to win a seat in the assembly, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said. A second round of balloting was likely to be held
Dec. 20, it said.
	   Alexander Vishnyakov, head of Russia's Central Election
Commission, predicted that at least 25 percent of the electorate
would vote by the end of the day, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Vishnyakov, in St. Petersburg to observe the elections, said
that so far, there had been ``no serious irregularities,'' in the
balloting.
	   Preliminary election results were expected early Monday.
	   St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, was at the
forefront of this country's democracy movement a decade ago, but as
it headed into the elections, its politics appeared as dirty and
deadly as anywhere in Russia.
	   There have been several attacks on prominent figures, including
politicians and businessmen.
	   Last year, the city's deputy governor was gunned down on a
central St. Petersburg street. In the past two months, hitmen have
claimed the lives of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city
official and a prominent banker.
	   Last month's killing of Galina Starovoitova, the country's most
prominent female politician, drew international condemnation and
focused attention on St. Petersburg's crime problems.
	   Boris Nemtsov, the former first deputy premier, recently visited
the city and called it ``the crime capital of Russia.''
	   Unlike many cities in Russia, where the city legislature has
little power, the assembly could be quite influential. A new city
charter calls for the legislature to be a full-time body with
extensive powers.
	   Alexander Yakovlev, the city's mayor, strongly opposed the new
charter, which curtails his clout. He is not on the ballot, but
critics say he has contributed to the mean-spirited atmosphere
surrounding the election.
	   Opponents of Yakovlev have found that people with the same name
were mysteriously proposed as candidates. This has been done in an
attempt to confuse voters and take away votes from liberals.
	   In addition, anti-Semitic leaflets have been handed out asking
citizens not to vote for Jewish candidates, and one candidate's
posters were defaced with slurs against Jews.
	   There have also been multiple reports of attempts to bribe
voters.
	   St. Petersburg's 3.7 million voters seem fed up with the city's
crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance, and
election officials predicted that only 35 percent of the electorate
would turn out for Sunday's polling, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Some 5,000 police were deployed to ensure law and order during
the balloting, the news agency said. Before polls opened, police
examined 1,500 polling stations, looking for explosives or other
items that could disrupt voting, it said.

Russia won't drop charges against Bliss
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; lonaakm1-oa &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONGVIEW, Wash. (AP) _ The Russian government has decided to
continue its investigation of former Longview resident Richard
Bliss on espionage charges, his lawyer says.
	   A State Department spokesman said that agency has learned from
the Russian prosecutor that the investigation will be extended for
another four months, lawyer Kim Roberts told The Daily News.
	   ``This means that Richard Bliss continues to be classified as a
spy and this matter is still hanging over his head,'' Roberts said.
	   Bliss said Friday his disappointment was tempered because he had
not expected the charges to be dropped.
	   ``There was never any indication of it,'' he told the newspaper.
If convicted, he faces 20 years in jail.
	   Bliss, 30, was arrested and charged with spying a year ago while
installing a cellular telephone system in Rostov-on-Don, a city
about 600 miles south of Moscow.
	   He was an employee of San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc. at the time,
but has since quit the company and sued it, alleging that Qualcomm
knowingly sent him to Russia with illegal satellite equipment.
	   Russian authorities said he took land surveys of restricted
sites using illegal satellite receivers he brought into the country
without customs clearance. He was jailed for 12 days before the
State Department pressured the Russian government for his release
last Christmas.
	   He has alleged that Qualcomm is more interested in protecting
its business interests in Russia than in clearing his name.
	   ``Qualcomm has said that they have been pressuring the Russians
to drop this case. The facts are that they haven't done diddly,''
said Martha Murphy, a Bliss spokeswoman.
	   When Bliss left Russia, his Russian lawyer told him that the
country's law requires prosecutors to try him or drop the charge
within 18 months _ a period that ends May 25.
	   But Bliss thinks otherwise.
	   ``There's a difference of opinion whether this has an ending at
all,'' he said.
	   He said he plans to return to college full time, using
retirement funds to cover the cost.
	   Over the Christmas holiday he will visit Longview to see his
father, Cowlitz PUD engineer Robert Bliss, and stepmother Lu Bliss.

Iraq's Aziz in Moscow for talks on U.N compliance

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz arrived in
Moscow Sunday for talks focusing on Iraq's compliance with the U.N.
Security Council resolutions in return for the lifting of
sanctions.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk told the Interfax news
agency Sunday that Russia will reiterate the ``need for Baghdad's
carrying out the measures detailed in the pertinent resolutions.''
	   Posuvalyuk said Aziz would meet on Monday with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
	   ``Russia's task is to stave off a new crisis around Iraq, to
continue a constructive solution of all remaining questions and to
remove tension in the Gulf zone,'' Ivanov said on the eve of Aziz'
visit, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Aziz and the Russians will discuss the situation in Iraq,
``particularly in the context of a comprehensive review by the U.N.
Security Council of the fulfillment of its resolutions by
Baghdad,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement Friday.
	   Russia has staunchly opposed the use of force against Iraq,
while urging it to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors. The
Iraqi government credited Russian diplomacy for helping end
peacefully last month's crisis over U.N. inspections.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons
of mass destruction before the Security Council will lift sanctions
imposed in 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait. The sanctions limit the
sale of oil, ban air travel and bar other financial dealings.
	   Iraq has long accused the inspectors of working on behalf of the
United States to prolong the sanctions.
	   The two sides will also discuss the participation of Russian
companies in the U.S. ``oil for food'' program, Posuvalyuk said.

 &UR; Russia's second city holds election marred by violence, dirty

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ St. Petersburg was at the
forefront of this country's democracy movement a decade ago, but as
it heads into city elections Sunday, its politics are now
considered as dirty and deadly as anywhere in Russia.
	   Last month's killing of Galina Starovoitova, the country's most
prominent female politician, drew international condemnation and
focused attention on St. Petersburg, a city that has failed to meet
its high expectations in the post-Soviet era.
	   The run-up to the election has been marred by several contract
killings of politicians and leading businessmen, beatings and
drive-by shootings against candidates and frequent reports of dirty
tricks by campaigners.
	   ``Five years ago we could hardly imagine that elections to the
St. Petersburg Legislative Assembly would include threats,
blackmail and assault,'' the head of Russia's Federal Security
Service, Vladimir Putin, said in an interview with the newspaper
Peterburgsky Chas Pik.
	   Boris Nemtsov, the former first deputy premier, recently visited
the city and called it ``the crime capital of Russia.''
	   In this atmosphere, 587 candidates are competing for 50 seats in
the city assembly. Unlike many cities in Russia, where the city
legislature has little power, this body could be quite influential.
	   A new city charter, introduced this year after a bitter battle,
calls for the legislature to be a full-time body with extensive
powers.
	   Gov. Alexander Yakovlev _ the city's mayor despite his title _
strongly opposed the new charter, which curtails his clout.
	   Yakovlev is not on the ballot and has not been actively
campaigning for individual candidates. But critics say the powerful
Yakovlev has contributed to the mean-spirited atmosphere
surrounding the election.
	   Prominent liberal politicians opposed to Yakovlev have found
that people who share the same name were mysteriously proposed as
candidates. This has been done in an attempt to confuse voters and
take away votes from liberals.
	   For example, when voters go to the polls, there will be two
``Sergei Belyayevs'' on the ballot. Voters may be hard-pressed to
determine which one is the well-known liberal and which one is the
anonymous decoy candidate.
	   In addition, anti-Semitic leaflets have been handed out asking
citizens not to vote for Jewish candidates, and one candidate's
posters were defaced with slurs against Jews.
	   There have also been multiple reports of attempts to bribe
voters.
	   Pensioners have reportedly been taken on ``free excursions'' _
bus rides with presents and free vodka _ which end at a polling
station where the retirees are told that the trip was sponsored by
a certain candidate whom they were asked to vote for.
	   St. Petersburg's 3.7 million voters seem fed up with the city's
crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance, but it's
not clear that they will turn out in large numbers.
	   St. Petersburg, which is Russia's second-largest city after
Moscow, had seemed a likely candidate for prosperity in the
post-Soviet era.
	   It's been a liberal, Westward-leaning city ever since the
Russian Czar Peter the Great built it from scratch at the beginning
of the 18th century and dubbed it the country's ``window on the
West.''
	   St. Petersburg produced many of the country's democratic
reformers and free-market economists in the late 1980s and early
1990s, but the city has languished since then.
	   The murder of Starovoitova seemed to symbolize much of what's
gone wrong. No one has been arrested for the Nov. 20 killing of
Starovoitova, who was a member of the national legislature and was
not on Sunday's ballot.
	   But her movement, Northern Capital, was based in St. Petersburg
and is expected to make a solid showing. She was an outspoken
critic of political corruption, and the Russian media has
speculated that she was killed by political opponents.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz arrived in
Moscow Sunday for talks focusing on Iraq's compliance with the U.N.
Security Council resolutions in return for the lifting of
sanctions.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk told the Interfax news
agency Sunday that Russia will reiterate the ``need for Baghdad's
carrying out the measures detailed in the pertinent resolutions.''
	   Posuvalyuk said Aziz would meet on Monday with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
	   During his four-day stay, Aziz will also visit the Russian
Foreign Relations Institute and hold several meetings with members
of parliament's International Affairs Committee, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   ``Russia's task is to stave off a new crisis around Iraq, to
continue a constructive solution of all remaining questions and to
remove tension in the Gulf zone,'' Ivanov said on the eve of Aziz'
visit, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Aziz and the Russians will discuss the situation in Iraq,
``particularly in the context of a comprehensive review by the U.N.
Security Council of the fulfillment of its resolutions by
Baghdad,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement Friday.
	   Russia has staunchly opposed the use of force against Iraq,
while urging it to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors. The
Iraqi government credited Russian diplomacy for helping end
peacefully last month's crisis over U.N. inspections.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons
of mass destruction before the Security Council will lift sanctions
imposed in 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait. The sanctions limit the
sale of oil, ban air travel and bar other financial dealings.
	   Iraq has long accused the inspectors of working on behalf of the
United States to prolong the sanctions.
	   The two sides will also discuss the participation of Russian
companies in the U.S. ``oil for food'' program, Posuvalyuk said.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ More than 500 candidates competed
Sunday in a down-and-dirty city election that was overshadowed by
the shooting death of a leading liberal politician.
	   Voter turnout was high by Russian standards, with 28 percent of
the voters casting ballots by early evening. But despite the strong
interest, nobody was expected to win outright. With so many
candidates vying for seats in the municipal legislature, runoffs
were considered certain in most or all races.
	   The election captured nationwide interest, mainly because of the
Nov. 20 killing of Galina Starovoitova, a member of the Russian
parliament who was pushing a liberal bloc of candidates in the St.
Petersburg elections.
	   Some of Starovoitova's supporters have suggested she was killed
to prevent her faction, Northern Capital, from doing well in the
election. It seemed possible, however, that it would have the
opposite effect of rallying her followers.
	   The election was considered important because the municipal
legislature in St. Petersburg has been given enhanced powers under
a new city charter, and will have a much stronger voice in city
affairs than similar bodies elsewhere in Russia.
	   Perhaps because of those stakes, the campaign was marred by
dirty tricks, violence and threats of violence.
	   Alexander Yakovlev, the city's mayor, strongly opposed the new
charter, which curtails his clout. He was not on the ballot, but
critics said his supporters contributed to the mean-spirited
atmosphere surrounding the election.
	   Yakovlev's opponents found that people with names identical to
theirs mysteriously wound up on the ballot in an apparent attempt
to confuse voters and take away votes from liberals.
	   In addition, anti-Semitic leaflets were handed out asking
citizens not to vote for Jewish candidates, and one candidate's
posters were defaced with slurs against Jews.
	   There were multiple reports of attempts to bribe voters.
	   On election day, three polling stations were briefly closed
after someone telephoned bomb threats to local authorities. No
bombs were found.
	   St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, was at the
forefront of the country's democracy movement a decade ago, but
much of its sense of itself as a progressive, Western-oriented city
has faded, at least in terms of city politics.
	   As it headed into the elections, St. Petersburg appeared at
least as dirty and deadly as anywhere in Russia.
	   Last year, the city's deputy governor was gunned down in the
city center. In the past two months, hitmen have claimed the lives
of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city official and a prominent
banker.
	   Last month's killing of Starovoitova, the country's most
prominent female politician, drew international condemnation and
focused attention on St. Petersburg's crime problems.
	   On Sunday, authorities said a businessman from the nearby city
of Novgorod was shot and killed in a St. Petersburg apartment
building by someone using a small-caliber pistol equipped with a
silencer _ the typical weapon of the city's contract hitmen.
	   Local prosecutors said the crime was unrelated to the election,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Boris Nemtsov, the former first deputy premier, recently visited
St. Petersburg and called it ``the crime capital of Russia.''
	   St. Petersburg's 3.7 million voters seem fed up with the city's
crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance. But it
wasn't clear how that would play itself out in terms of voting.
	   Preliminary election results were not expected until sometime
Monday.

Russian nuclear fuel to be shipped to Armenia soon

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will deliver nuclear fuel for an Armenian
power plant on Friday, Nuclear Minister Yevgeny Adamov told a news
agency.
	   Adamov had previously said that Russia would supply the fuel,
even though Armenia had not paid for previous deliveries and is
unlikely to do so soon. He said Russia had agreed to help for
political reasons.
	   Adamov told ITAR-Tass on Sunday that the fuel would be flown to
Armenia on Friday. He spoke in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, where
he had gone to observe the 10th anniversary of Armenia's
devastating earthquake.
	   The fuel will be used by the Medzamor nuclear power plant, which
produces 40 percent of the Armenia's power.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A widow who is accused of killing her husband, a
prominent Russian lawmaker, has been examined by psychiatrists and
found sane, her daughter and son-in-law said Sunday.
	   Tamara Rokhlin confessed last summer to shooting and killing her
husband, retired Gen. Lev Rokhlin, a fierce critic of President
Boris Yeltsin. She has been charged with murder.
	   Her daughter and son-in-law, who were interviewed on television
Sunday, reiterated previous statements that Tamara Rokhlin had only
confessed because of a threat against her children, according to
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Her children maintain that the killing was politically motivated
and that their mother had nothing to do with it.

of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city official and a prominent
banker.

crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance. But it
wasn't clear how that would play itself out in terms of voting.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Despite the strong interest in
legislative elections that were overshadowed by the shooting death
of a leading liberal politician, nobody was expected to win
outright and runoffs were considered certain in most races.
	   More than 500 candidates competed Sunday in St. Petersburg's
city election.
	   Turnout was high by Russian standards, with 38 percent of
eligible voters casting ballots. But with so many candidates vying
for seats in the municipal legislature, runoffs were expected in
most if not all races.
	   The election captured nationwide interest, mainly because of the
Nov. 20 killing of Galina Starovoitova, the country's most
prominent female politician and a member of the Russian parliament
who was pushing a liberal bloc of candidates in the St. Petersburg
elections.
	   Some of Starovoitova's supporters have suggested she was killed
to prevent her faction, Northern Capital, from doing well in the
election, although it could have the opposite effect of rallying
her followers.
	   Preliminary election results were expected later Monday.
	   The election was considered important because the municipal
legislature in St. Petersburg has been given enhanced powers under
a new city charter, and will have a much stronger voice in city
affairs than similar bodies elsewhere in Russia.
	   Perhaps because of those stakes, the campaign was marred by
dirty tricks, violence and threats of violence.
	   Alexander Yakovlev, the city's mayor, strongly opposed the new
charter, which curtails his clout. He was not on the ballot, but
critics said his supporters contributed to the mean-spirited
atmosphere surrounding the election.
	   Yakovlev's opponents found that people with names identical to
theirs mysteriously wound up on the ballot in an apparent attempt
to confuse voters and take away votes from liberals.
	   In addition, anti-Semitic leaflets were handed out asking
citizens not to vote for Jewish candidates, and one candidate's
posters were defaced with slurs against Jews.
	   There were several reports of attempts to bribe voters. Police
said they arrested three people who were offering 25 rubles to 50
rubles (dlrs 1.25 to dlrs 2.50) in exchange for votes for specified
candidates, ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   On election day, three polling stations briefly were closed
after someone telephoned bomb threats to local authorities. No
bombs were found.
	   St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, was at the
forefront of the country's democracy movement a decade ago, but
much of its sense of itself as a progressive, Western-oriented city
has faded, at least in terms of city politics.
	   As it headed into the elections, St. Petersburg appeared at
least as dirty and deadly as anywhere in Russia.
	   Last year, the city's deputy governor was gunned down in the
city center. In the past two months, hitmen have claimed the lives
of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city official and a prominent
banker.
	   St. Petersburg's 3.7 million voters seem fed up with the city's
crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance. But it
wasn't clear how that would play itself out in terms of voting.

Russia's Defense Ministry will owe 25 billion rubles on Jan 1.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Defense Ministry will owe weapons makers
and others more than 25 billion rubles (dlrs 1.25 billion) by Jan.
1 for maintenance of the country's weapons arsenal, a news report
said Monday.
	   Over half of that sum will be the ministry's debt for weapons
maintenance and purchases, said Col. Gen. Anatoly Sitnov, the head
of the armament department of the armed forces, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   The Defense Ministry will owe another 7.8 billion (dlrs 350
million) for research and development, and 3 billion (dlrs 150
million) for repairs, he said.
	   Sitnov also said a preliminary draft of the government's defense
spending in 1999, at 90 billion rubles (dlrs 4.5 billion), would
not be nearly enough to train troops or purchase spare parts and
fuel.
	   ``Modernization or purchased of advanced hardware are out of the
question with this budget draft,'' he said, according to Interfax.
	   Sitnov called for the government to dedicate 3.5 percent of the
Gross Domestic Product to military spending. The proposed 1999
draft calls for military spending of 2.6 percent.
	   Russia's military has suffered heavy funding cuts since the
collapse of the Soviet Union. Much of its equipment is out-of-date
or doesn't work properly, and soldiers often receive inadequate
training and endure atrocious living conditions.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Yeltsin returning to hospital &LR;  &QL; 

<TEXT>
 &UR; Yeltsin fires most top aides on his first working day after
illness &LR;  
	    &UR; From AP-Reuters &LR;  &QC; 
	   MOSCOW (CP) _ President Boris Yeltsin returned to work today
with a bang, firing most of his top aides after a two-week
hospitalization for pneumonia.
	   On his first day back at the Kremlin, Yeltsin dismissed chief of
staff Valentin Yumashev and his deputies Yuri Yarov, Mikhail
Komissar and Yevgeny Savostyanov, a Kremlin spokesman said.
	   Nikolai Bordyuzha, secretary of the presidential security
council, was appointed new chief of staff, while the other posts
remained vacant. Bordyuzha will serve in both posts.
	   After about three hours at work in the Kremlin, Yeltsin returned
to hospital, his spokesman said.
	   Dmitry Yakushkin told reporters the 67-year-old president would
stay in hospital until he finished a course of medical treatment
for pneumonia.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin's blitz appearance in the Kremlin _
between 8:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. _ was prompted by fears his
administration was showing a lack of commitment in fighting
corruption, political extremism and regional separatism amid a
bitter economic crisis. 
	   The Kremlin had no explanation for the sudden dismissals, a move
common under Yeltsin's leadership. They could reflect the
president's unhappiness over the way some aides handled his recent
hospitalization and their unusual candidness about his health.
	   The Russian media has said the passive and defeatist aides were
further eroding Yeltsin's power. With their intimate knowledge of
the workings of the Kremlin and the president's routine, they had
considerable influence.
	   Yumashev and other Kremlin aides had openly called Yeltsin too
weak to make foreign trips or to handle daily affairs of state and
suggested he leave economic control to Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
	   Yeltsin today also took personal control of the Justice Ministry
and tax police _ two key government structures previously under
Primakov's command. The move was clearly aimed at strengthening
Yeltsin's authority, although its immediate implications were
unclear.
	   Yeltsin insists he has no serious health problems and that he
remains in control of the government.
	   Yeltsin had all but disappeared from sight when he entered a
government hospital Nov. 22 with pneumonia, the latest in a long
string of health problems.
	   Despite calls for his resignation by opponents concerned about
his health, Yeltsin and his doctors insist he will serve out his
term, which ends in 2000.
	   Yakushkin said during the weekend that Yeltsin was ``still the
most influential politician in the country, no matter what is said
about it.''
	   Presidential aides said last week that doctors had difficulty
persuading Yeltsin to rest and recover completely. Primakov
appealed to Yeltsin to stay in the hospital until he had fully
recovered.

Ukrainian authorities cut off Russian fleet's telephones
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEVASTOPOL, Ukraine (AP) _ A Ukrainian telephone company shut
off lines to Russia's Black Sea fleet in the Crimean port of
Sevastopol because the fleet hasn't paid its bills, fleet officials
said Monday.
	   According to the state-owned Ukrtelecom company, the fleet owed
more than 500,000 hryvna (dlrs 146,000) in unpaid bills as of Nov.
30.
	   The company shut down lines to the fleet commander's deputies,
top aides and senior staff officers, the independent UNIAN news
agency reported.
	   Russia can no longer fully finance the fleet, which has become
the city's largest single debtor. It owes about 10.6 million hryvna
(dlrs 3 million) for electricity, water and heat, city authorities
say.
	   Russia rents naval bases in Sevastopol in Ukraine, a mostly
ethnic Russian city on the Crimean Peninsula, under a 1996 deal on
dividing the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet. The status of
Sevastopol _ which Russian nationalists argue should belong to
Russia _ has spoiled relations between the two countries since the
1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The cash-poor city government has already cut off electricity
and heat to some of the fleet's bases, prompting angry appeals from
fleet commander Vladimir Komoedov.
	   Komoedov has warned that the city's measures might lead to new
tension, but city authorities insist that no politics are involved.
	   Fleet officials, however, point out that the Sevastopol populace
and enterprises owe some 4.4 million hryvna (dlrs 1.28 million) in
unpaid telephone bills alone.

Russian ruble plunges further, World Bank team arrives for talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A team of experts from the World Bank arrived in
Moscow for more loan talks Monday as the battered Russian ruble
continued to slip, heading for a record low since financial crisis
hit Russia in August.
	   The World Bank experts were to reconsider the terms of a earlier
promised dlrs 1.5 billion loan for structural reform, as well as a
dlrs 800 million social reform credit and a dlrs 800 million loan
to streamline the ailing coal industry, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The team will make recommendations to the World Bank board of
directors later this month, when it discusses its strategy on
Russia.
	   The loans are part of an IMF-led dlrs 22.3 billion bailout
package that was agreed upon before economic crisis forced the
government to devalue the ruble and put a 90-day moratorium on
foreign debt Aug. 17.
	   Meanwhile, the ruble plunged again in trading Monday, closing at
20.4 to the dollar, down 0.8 from Friday. The ruble sold for more
than 20 to the dollar for a couple of days shortly after the
country's economic crisis hit in mid-August before making a modest
comeback.
	   The currency remained relatively stable through most of the
autumn, trading at around 16 to the dollar before resuming a steady
fall at the end of last month. The ruble was at about 6 to the
dollar before the crisis.
	   With Russian financial markets virtually wiped out by the
crisis, the ruble has become the main indicator of economic
confidence. Its fall reflects fears that the government will flood
the economy with a lot of new cash to pay its huge debts _ a move
that is certain to trigger high inflation.
	   The Cabinet of Prime Minister Yevegny Primakov has said it may
have to print large amounts of money if international lenders,
including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, don't
release the loan package agreed last summer and put on hold after
the crisis hit.
	   In talks last week, the IMF urged Russia to provide a realistic
budget for next year as a key condition for resuming loans, but
showed no sign that it would free the money any time soon. IMF
experts have criticized the government's tax collection targets as
overly optimistic and criticized its economic blueprint for being
overloaded with state interference.
	   Until the IMF acts, other foreign lenders are unlikely to give
Russia the infusion of cash it needs to pay workers, pensioners and
foreign creditors.

Russia, Iraq claim sanctions against Baghdad could be lifted soon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Iraq's Tariq Aziz and Russia's foreign minister
said Monday that the Arab nation was again cooperating with U.N
weapons inspectors and that sanctions relief should be granted
soon.
	   Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, maintains regular ties with
Russia, which is sympathetic to Baghdad and supports the early
lifting of the comprehensive U.N. sanctions.
	   ``We believe that soon the sanctions will be lifted,'' Russia's
Foreign Minister Ivan Ivanov told a news conference after meeting
Aziz. ``We are approaching the end of a long process.''
	   Despite Ivanov's optimism, there are no signs that the United
States and Britain, the leading proponents of sanctions, are
prepared to ease their stance following repeated showdowns with
Iraq.
	   Iraq agreed to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors
last month after a confrontation that nearly led to military
strikes by the United States.
	   Aziz said he hoped that ``lawful and objective inspections''
could take place next month. And he again criticized the U.N.
Security Council for failing to end the embargo that was placed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``For more than seven years Iraq has been following through on
its obligations, but the Security Council hasn't been meeting its
obligations,'' Aziz said. ``This is unacceptable.''
	   While offering Iraq moral support, Russia has insisted that
Baghdad comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 687, which
calls for the dismantling of all weapons of mass destruction, the
main condition for ending the sanctions.
	   ``We are calling for the full implementation ... which should
lead to the lifting of the oil embargo,'' Ivanov said.
	   Aziz was to meet Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov later
on Monday.
	   Primakov, a fluent Arabic speaker who has known Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein for years, has mediated on several occasions when
Iraq and the United Nations were in the midst of a confrontation.
	   Iraq wants the embargo lifted so it can resume exporting oil at
full capacity and rebuild its shattered economy. It is permitted
limited oil exports at present to buy food and medicine.
	   Russia, meanwhile, is owed billions of dollars by Iraq and wants
to help rebuild the country's oil industry when the sanctions are
lifted.
	   However, world oil prices are already sagging due to an oil
glut, and if Iraq increased its exports it could push prices even
lower.

Impeachment commission says Yeltsin not guilty of destroying
</HEADLINE>
military &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A parliamentary commission seeking to impeach
Russian President Boris Yeltsin decided Monday he was not directly
responsible for the collapse of the country's military, a news
report said.
	   Lawmakers had accused Yeltsin of underfunding the armed forces,
which don't have the money to maintain equipment, modernize
technology or properly train soldiers because of the country's
economic problems.
	   Commission members had said throughout the proceedings that they
probably would not be able to prove that Yeltsin purposely sought
to destroy the military, and as a result, his role in its collapse
would not constitute an impeachable offense.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin, who has been hospitalized with pneumonia
over the last two weeks, surfaced briefly at the Kremlin on Monday
to fire his chief of staff and other aides. He then returned to the
hospital.
	   The commission, which is drawing up articles of impeachment, has
already said Yeltsin committed three impeachable offenses:
instigating the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, illegally
sending troops and tanks against his foes in the previous
parliament in 1993, and launching the unsuccessful war in
separatist Chechnya.
	   Any impeachment motion is unlikely to remove Yeltsin. It would
need a two-thirds majority in the upper and lower houses of
parliament, as well as approval by the pro-Yeltsin Constitutional
and Supreme Courts.
	   The impeachment commission will meet in mid-December to discuss
the fifth and final impeachment article, which accuses Yeltsin of
genocide, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The commission will try to determine whether Yeltsin was
responsible for a deterioration in Russia's living standards since
the Soviet Union fell that includes a greater incidence of disease
and a lower birth-rate and life expectancy, Commission Chairman
Vadim Filimonov told ITAR-Tass.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Returning to work for a mere three hours, Boris
Yeltsin fired most of his top aides today and said he was assuming
control of two key government agencies. The shakeup removed several
aides who had publicly questioned the Russian president's health.
	   Afterward, Yeltsin went back to the government hospital where he
has been staying for the past two weeks.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin was quoted by
presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin as telling the aides.
	   The 67-year-old president will remain in the hospital as long as
necessary to fully recuperate from pneumonia, Yakushkin said.
	   Yeltsin dismissed Chief of Staff Valentin Yumashev and his
deputies Yuri Yarov, Mikhail Komissar and Yevgeny Savostyanov.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff, while the
other posts remain vacant. Bordyuzha, who will retain his
presidential security council post, formerly was chief of the
Border Guards.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin dismissed the aides because of their
failure to stem crime or respond to several incidents of political
extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist deputy in
the Russian parliament.
	   ``That undermines confidence in the president and in the
government as a whole, and that is inadmissible in the current
difficult economic situation,'' the spokesman said.
	   Yeltsin has a habit of unexpected and often unexplained
dismissals. The latest round also was thought to reflect his
unhappiness over the aides' unusual candidness about his health.
	   Yumashev and other Kremlin aides openly had said that Yeltsin is
too weak to handle day-to-day affairs or to make foreign trips and
suggested he leave control of the economy and other affairs to
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   The Russian media have suggested that the aides _ who had
considerable influence since they handled the workings of the
Kremlin and the president's routine _ were eroding Yeltsin's power.
	   ``The president wanted to show who is the boss,'' Alexander
Shokhin, the head of the pro-government Our Home Is Russia faction,
told reporters. ``He's like a lion who licked his wounds and now
roared at those who thought he was already out of the game.''
	   Ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky praised the president for
ridding the Kremlin of what he described as corrupt, weak
``slime,'' and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov added his support.
	   ``After every illness or holiday of the president we always
expect inexplicable personnel reshuffling,'' said Communist Party
official Valentin Kuptsov.
	   In his brief flurry of activity, Yeltsin also said he would
begin overseeing the justice ministry and tax police _ without
replacing the actual heads. The move is aimed at stepping up fight
against endemic corruption and other crime, Yakushkin said.
	   A top lawmaker, Galina Starovoitova, was slain last month in St.
Petersburg in an apparent contract killing. Her death outraged and
shocked many Russians.
	   Yeltsin all but disappeared from sight when he entered a
government hospital Nov. 22 with pneumonia, the latest in a string
of health problems.
	   Many of Yeltsin's opponents claim he hasn't been seriously
involved in national affairs for a long time and is no longer fit
to lead.
	   Despite calls for his resignation, Yeltsin and his doctors
insist that the president will serve out his term, which ends in
2000.

 &UR; WEEKLY FARM: Russian crisis drives down U.S. dark meat prices &QL; 
 &UR; By JANELLE CARTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Farm Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Economic troubles in Russia, where dark meat
of the chicken is widely popular, are pushing down prices for
drumsticks and thighs in U.S. supermarkets.
	   So far, however, the plunging prices have failed to lure large
numbers of health-conscious Americans away from their preferred
lean chicken breasts.
	   ``Until the Russian crisis began, Russia was a very good
complementary market,'' said Richard Lobb, spokesman for the
National Broiler Council. But now, he said, ``the importers in
Russia are having trouble coming up with the dollars to pay for
imports.''
	   Last year, Russia bought 925,000 tons of dark-meat chicken
valued at more than $700 million. This year growers expected
Russian buys of dark meat that would reach an estimated 1 million
tons.
	   But the country's financial collapse has brought its purchases
to a near standstill.
	   The result: Dropping dark meat prices for Americans.
	   ``This has led to a real windfall for American consumers,'' Lobb
said.
	   In recent weeks, leg quarters have sold in some parts of the
country for as low as 49 cents a pound, he said.
	   At a local Safeway grocery store in Upper Marlboro, Md., a
Washington suburb, leg quarters were selling last week at 99 cents
a pound. Prices were similar at other Washington area stores, not
so inexpensive as elsewhere but still significantly cheaper than
the $1.50 a pound and more that people were paying for chicken
breasts.
	   ``We have definitely seen a drop in the price at the wholesale
and retail level. Prices are about 28 percent down,'' Giant
supermarket spokesman Barry Scher said Friday. He added that stores
report more shoppers are taking advantage of the lower prices.
	   ``I've noticed a big markdown in chicken prices,'' said
Gaithersburg, Md., resident Nikki Cooper, who found a five-pound
bag of leg quarters last week for less than a dollar a pound.
``I've always liked dark meat, but these prices make it even
better.''
	   There was a time when Americans preferred dark meat, Lobb said.
``Thirty years ago the situation was just the opposite, and the
companies could not sell all of the white meat,'' he said.
	   In the time since, however, Americans have come to love chicken
breasts, which are lower in fat and easier to cook.
	   ``The hottest product has been the skinless boneless breast,''
Lobb said.
	   For now, the chicken industry plans to wait out the Russian
crisis by trying to develop quick and tasty dark-meat recipes in
hopes of luring more U.S. sales.
	   ``If we could find something that would do for thighs and
drumsticks what Buffalo wings did for wings,'' Lobb said, ``we'd be
in good shape.''

 &UR; AP Television Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Marina Kovalyov's mother lives in Brooklyn now.
But like many immigrants, her heart is elsewhere.
	   The people and places of her native Russia are never far from
her thoughts. Letters and phone calls keep her in touch with her
homeland and, for several hours a day, so does the television.
	   The Kovalyov family subscribes to a TV service that beams
Russian programming into their home _ political gossip and local
news, old movies from the Soviet era, even some of the blue rock
videos that make babushkas cluck in dismay at decadent youth.
	   It's provided by the Ethnic-American Broadcasting Co., a small
company that hopes to grow quickly by appealing to the homesickness
of America's newest citizens.
	   About 70,000 people, almost all of them in the nation's biggest
cities, already pay between dlrs 9 and dlrs 25 a month for a window
into their old world. EABC also offers Arabic, Indian, Chinese,
Filipino, Greek, Italian and Ukrainian programming.
	   The company was founded as a radio station in 1987 by a Russian
emigre, Pavel Paley. He methodically expanded into television,
adding customers by wiring one apartment building at a time.
	   An investment banker, David Moro, bought the company in 1991 and
began expanding it beyond the Russian community.
	   ``What attracted me to this business was the amazing loyalty to
the viewers that this service had,'' Moro said. ``It was an
umbilical cord connecting them to the culture and language in their
home country. And just as important, it became the voice of their
community here.''
	   In addition to the shows lifted from television back home,
EABC's channels also provide two hours of daily programming with
news about immigrant communities and advice on how to pass an
American citizenship test.
	   Nostalgia programming _ old movies and vintage television series
_ are most popular among EABC viewers. They're also insatiable news
watchers, and EABC will frequently telecast specials like election
day coverage from overseas.
	   The company has acquired programming from such services as
Italy's Ciao TV, the Egyptian Satellite Channel, Network Asia from
India and Pakistan and ECom, a 24-hour Chinese language channel.
One of the only ethnic groups EABC has not tried to reach are
Hispanics, who already have the well-established Univision and
Telemundo networks.
	   Kovalyov, who runs the Russian-American Arts Foundation in New
York, said her mother and mother-in-law watch most of EABC's
programming in her family. Both women are in their 70s. While they
appreciate the channel, Kovalyov said she wished EABC spent more
time helping Russian immigrants learn about their new country.
	   ``There are many people who are not that interested in what's
going on in Russia,'' she said. ``We belong here. We came here.''
	   It's basically the same argument that rages over bilingual
education in schools: Do these services help or hinder assimilation
into a new culture?
	   Moro said the integration of immigrants into the American
mainstream is irresistible, and his service does nothing to stand
in its way. Most of EABC's new clients are already three or five
years in America, he said. Young families want it more for their
older relatives than for themselves.
	   ``What we help do is keep alive their culture and language in
the broadcast medium,'' he said. ``There's a richness and a wealth
to that that would be unfortunate to lose.''
	   Moro has had to spend much of his time developing a distribution
system. EABC's channels are not widely disseminated like broadcast
signals or through cable. Instead, subscribers need to buy their
own satellite dish or live in a building where special receiving
equipment has been installed.
	   Moro's 250 employees are a mix of the technically and culturally
savvy. After all, someone needs to understand why rock videos that
would never be shown in America are perfectly acceptable to a
Russian audience.
	   It's not an easy combination, though. During the World Cup, Moro
took the advice of American-born staff members believed pre-empting
much of the ethnic programming for a month to show soccer would pay
off in extra advertising revenue. Many of his Russian programmers
quit in disgust after unsuccessfully arguing that viewers would be
angry about losing their regular shows.
	   ``It was a lousy business decision,'' Moro conceded. ``Our
subscribers were furious with us.''
	   EABC is building a corporate headquarters in Fort Lee, New
Jersey, and expects to operate 20 separate channels by the time it
opens next spring. The company also hopes to boost its dlrs 25
million in revenue to several hundred million dollars within five
or six years. They cite the 4.8 million immigrants who have come to
the United States since the early 1990s as an untapped market.
	   That's still relatively small, compared to the nearly 70 million
cable TV subscribers in the U.S., and is one of the reasons EABC
has the market largely to itself.
	   Moro said the audience makes up for in dedication what it lacks
in size. Statistics show his customers are far less likely than
cable viewers to give up the service.
	   ``They really view us as a resource,'' he said. ``It forges a
loyalty and a commitment to the company.''

Russia has cheap way to get rid of old missiles _ launch them
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's cash-strapped missile forces have
designed a cheap way of getting rid of old nuclear missiles _
launching them.
	   The Scalpel missiles would be launched without nuclear warheads,
and their trajectory would be calculated so that they use up all
their fuel and then burn in the atmosphere, the missile force press
service said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   However, the service life of the missiles has expired, and
engineers are no longer sure whether the missiles will accurately
follow their programmed path.
	   Continued storage of the missiles is dangerous and expensive,
the missile force said.

Monument to Lenin unveiled in Murmansk region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A monument to Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin was
unveiled in a northern Russian town Saturday, a news agency
reported.
	   The ceremony in the central park of Polyarnye Zori, a town in
the Murmansk region, reversed the usual post-Soviet pattern of
tearing such statues down.
	   Mikhail Antropov, head of the local Communist Party, told the
Interfax news agency that the monument would ``remind future
generations of the great accomplishments of the leader of the world
proletariat.''
	   Every town in the Soviet Union had a Lenin monument _ and
usually more than one _ but thousands were toppled following the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
	   The unveiling of the new monument may be an effort by the
Communist Party to take advantage of disgust with the current
government and nostalgia for the relative economic stability of the
Soviet era. Aside from the elderly, however, few Russians want to
see a restoration of the Soviet state.
	   In Moscow, the State Duma on Friday recommended the restoration
of a statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, head of the first secret police
organization in the Soviet era.
	   The statue loomed before the KGB headquarters in central Moscow
until it was toppled by euphoric pro-democracy protesters in 1991.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ More than 500 candidates Sunday
vied for 50 Legislative Assembly seats in an election preceded by
contract killings, beatings of candidates and and dirty tricks by
campaigners.
	   A total of 577 names were on the ballot and observers predicted
that none of the candidates would get the 51 percent of the vote
needed to win a seat in the assembly, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said. A second round of balloting was likely to be held Dec. 20, it
said.
	   Initial voter turnout was low, with only 2.57 percent of the
city's registered voters casting ballots by midday, the Interfax
news agency said. Preliminary election results were expected early
Monday.
	   St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, was at the
forefront of this country's democracy movement a decade ago, but as
it headed into the elections, its politics appeared as dirty and
deadly as anywhere in Russia.
	   There have been several attacks on prominent figures, including
politicians and businessmen.
	   Last year, the city's deputy governor was gunned down on a
central St. Petersburg street. In the past two months, hitmen have
claimed the lives of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city
official and a prominent banker.
	   Last month's killing of Galina Starovoitova, the country's most
prominent female politician, drew international condemnation and
focused attention on St. Petersburg's crime problems.
	   Boris Nemtsov, the former first deputy premier, recently visited
the city and called it ``the crime capital of Russia.''
	   Unlike many cities in Russia, where the city legislature has
little power, the assembly could be quite influential. A new city
charter calls for the legislature to be a full-time body with
extensive powers.
	   Alexander Yakovlev, the city's mayor, strongly opposed the new
charter, which curtails his clout. He is not on the ballot, but
critics say he has contributed to the mean-spirited atmosphere
surrounding the election.
	   Opponents of Yakovlev have found that people with the same name
were mysteriously proposed as candidates. This has been done in an
attempt to confuse voters and take away votes from liberals.
	   In addition, anti-Semitic leaflets have been handed out asking
citizens not to vote for Jewish candidates, and one candidate's
posters were defaced with slurs against Jews.
	   There have also been multiple reports of attempts to bribe
voters.
	   St. Petersburg's 3.7 million voters seem fed up with the city's
crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance, and
election officials predicted that only 35 percent of the electorate
would turn out for Sunday's polling, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Some 5,000 police were deployed to ensure law and order during
the balloting, the news agency said. Before polls opened, police
examined 1,500 polling stations, looking for explosives or other
items that could disrupt voting, it said.

Russian complaints underscore tension at Christian assembly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD N. OSTLING &QC;

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A Russian Orthodox Church delegate
complained on Sunday that a council representing hundreds of
millions of non-Catholic Christians is dominated by liberal Western
policies, and said members of his church were being isolated.
	   The Rev. Hilarion Alfeyev, who is leading a five-person Russian
delegation at the World Council of Churches assembly in Zimbabwe's
capital, said the possibility of Orthodox Church delegates walking
out was not a threat, but ``an outcry of pain.''
	   ``We do no want to leave, but we want the WCC radically
transformed,'' he said.
	   The Orthodox churches of Bulgaria and the Georgian republic have
already quit the council, and senior Russian Orthodox Church
officials are not attending the assembly.
	   The council has a total constituency of 350 to 450 million
non-Catholic Christians. The assembly, with 960 delegates from 112
countries, is the WCC's highest deliberative body.
	   Alfeyev said his church is the largest in the WCC, putting its
membership at more than 100 million.
	   ``Many Protestant churches have adopted the tendencies of
liberal western society,'' Alfeyev said. ``The WCC agenda is
dominated by a western Protestant ethos....We are becoming more and
more isolated.''
	   Orthodox leaders have said many in the council take too liberal
a stance on key issues including homosexuality and the inclusion of
women clergy.
	   Dozens of Orthodox delegates agreed Sunday night that leaders of
their national delegations would jointly draft a petition stating
demands to help restore full Orthodox participation.
	   Another top Eastern Orthodox leader, Albania's Archbishop
Anastasios, said Orthodox enthusiasm for the council and relations
with Protestants had deteriorated notably during his 35 years of
interchuch involvement.
	   The Orthodox pleas drew a testy response from several
Protestants at the assembly, including a bishop from Germany who
expressed irritation that the Russian had cited his church's size.
	   In remarks that drew the day's warmest applause, one of the
first generation of women priests in the Church of England, Rev.
Rose Hudson-Wilkin, also complained about the threatened walk-outs.
	   ``You say I'm bigger than you are, or we have this great
tradition. This is all about power,'' she said. ``Let's not wrap it
up in theological language.''

In Israel, less-than-enthusiastic welcome shaping up for Clinton
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 9, Netanyahu denies initiated Clinton visit;
14, more clashes; 15, hunger strike said to be expanding; 20, Levy
won't renew talks &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, reflecting
growing Israeli unease over U.S. President Bill Clinton's upcoming
visit, suggested Monday that the trip was entirely at the
initiative of the American leader.
	   ``What am I going to tell him, not to come _ don't come? I can
prevent him from coming?'' Netanyahu asked rhetorically in an
interview on army radio. ``We're not accustomed to refusing someone
who wants to come.''
	   In another sign of tensions arising from the trip, the speaker
of Israel's parliament, Dan Tichon, said he intended to boycott
Clinton-connected events to protest the fact that the president did
not plan to address the Knesset.
	   Clinton's visit to Israel, which begins Saturday, is to be
coupled with a stop in the Gaza Strip, the first by a sitting U.S.
president.
	   The United States has repeatedly said the trip is not intended
as an endorsement of Palestinian statehood aspirations, but the
Palestinians see it as a powerful boost to their sovereignty hopes.
	   On Monday, speaking to reporters in Gaza, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat hailed the upcoming trip as ``historical and great.''
	   The presidential visit to Israel and the Palestinian lands is
meant to encourage both sides to stick to the timetable set out in
the Wye River accords signed in October.
	   Netanyahu said Clinton's trip ``has value only if he strengthens
the Palestinian fulfillment of their obligations'' under the
agreement.
	   He continued to deny U.S. administration claims that he had
initiated Clinton's _ but insisted that Clinton would nonetheless
be received warmly
	   In recent weeks, Israel and the Palestinians have accused one
another of failing to live up to various provisions, and Israel has
threatened to hold off on a scheduled Dec. 18 troop pullback.
	   Palestinians, for their part, are angry over stepped-up Jewish
settlement activity in the West Bank and Israel's failure to free
hundreds of so-called security prisoners, jailed for anti-Israel
activity.
	   Israel released the first 250 of a promised 750 Palestinian
prisoners last month, but they were mainly criminals, not security
prisoners as the Palestinians have demanded.
	   In response, Palestinians have been staging protests that have
repeatedly boiled over into violent street clashes.
	   More clashes with between protesters and Israeli and Palestinian
troops took place Monday in several West Bank towns.
	   Also, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners were continuing a hunger
strike begun over the weekend. A prisoners' association said the
hunger strike now included all 3,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails,
although the Israeli Prisons Service said it knew of only 514
taking part.
	   The controversy over Clinton's visit also comes as Netanyahu is
trying to quell a potential parliamentary rebellion. Opposition
from within the coalition to Israel's ceding of West Bank land has
forced Netanyahu to seek new allies to prop up his government.
	   A vote on early elections was possible later Monday, but the
prime minister's opponents may not push the issue forward if they
lack the votes.
	   Netanyahu has been sparring publicly with his former foreign
minister, David Levy, who considered rejoining the shaky governing
coalition in exchange for the finance minister's job.
	   The prime minister said the two couldn't agree on economic
principles and that he wouldn't sacrifice Israel's economy to
coalition politics.
	   Radio reports said Monday that Levy would not renew negotiations
with Netanyahu and would support early elections.

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ The world's most elite construction
crew blazed into orbit Friday aboard space shuttle Endeavour to
begin assembling the international space station _ a complex and
risky project that could have its white-knuckle moments.
	   ``Let's go do this,'' said shuttle commander Robert Cabana,
eager to deliver the first American-made piece of the space station
after a year's delay and an exasperating, last-minute postponement
the day before.
	   ``Amen,'' launch control replied.
	   Endeavour lifted off at 3:35 a.m. with a brilliant white flash.
With that, the most massive construction project ever attempted in
space had begun: the building of a 1 million-pound outpost 250
miles above Earth.
	   On Sunday evening, after a round-the-world chase, Endeavour's
astronauts will capture Zarya, a space station piece put into orbit
by the Russians two weeks ago, and attach it to Unity, the
U.S.-built part on board the shuttle.
	   The five Americans and one Russian settled quickly into orbit
and began checking the equipment they will need to accomplish the
job. ``The crew's feeling awesome, and we're ready to go to work up
here,'' Cabana called down.
	   Forty-three more U.S. and Russian launches will be needed over
the next five years to haul up more than 100 space station parts.
And 162 spacewalks will be required for assembly and maintenance.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright joined other dignitaries
from around the world to watch the launch, and applauded the
16-nation project.
	   ``All day long I deal with disputes on the ground, countries
that can't get along, and it's great to look at this space station
endeavor,'' she said.
	   NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin acknowledged it will be
``rough'' building the space station with the Russians, whose cash
crunch had delayed Endeavour's flight for a year. Already, NASA has
funneled $60 million to the Russians to complete some crucial
equipment. Millions more will almost certainly be needed.
	   Russia's problems aside, Goldin warned of ``some white-knuckled
times'' in the years ahead. Some of the problems, in fact, will
eclipse the fire and collision aboard Mir last year, he said.
	   ``Remember: These astronauts are moving 20,000- and 40,000-pound
masses. They're not going to be able to pretrain for everything,''
he said. ``Problems could occur. Equipment could break.
Life-support systems could go down.''
	   Once Zarya and Unity are connected with the help of Endeavour's
robot arm and thruster rockets _ the hardest job of the mission _
two Endeavour astronauts will make three spacewalks to hook up all
the electrical connections and cables by hand.
	   The combined modules will jut 77 feet out of Endeavour's cargo
bay and have a mass of 70,000 pounds.
	   Zarya will provide power and propulsion. Unity is a cylindrical
passageway to which other pieces of the space station will be
attached.
	   The first attempt to launch Endeavour, on Thursday, ended after
an alarm in the cockpit went off with 4{ minutes remaining in the
countdown. A sensitive toggle switch in the hydraulic power system
was blamed.
	   Another alarm sounded within moments of Endeavour's arrival in
orbit Friday. One of three hydraulic power units had overheated,
and the pilots switched to a backup circuit.
	   NASA said engineers are confident the problem will not affect
the 12-day flight. Endeavour is due back on Dec. 15.

Utility turns on heat after demonstrators block rail line
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Utility officials resumed supplying heat and
electricity to a Moscow suburb Saturday after about 50 people
blocked railroad tracks to protest the shutting off of their
utilities, a news agency said.
	   The protest took place in the town of Scherbinka, about 3
kilometers (2 miles) south of Moscow, Interfax said. After reaching
agreement with utility officials, the demonstrators were allowed to
leave, and no arrests were reported.
	   The demonstrators' heat and electricity had been shut off
earlier in the day. During the protest, they allowed long-distance
passenger trains to pass but halted other trains, Interfax said.
	   Utility shutoffs have become common in parts of Russia this
winter, as the country's economic crisis exacerbates an already
serious problem of nonpayment for many utility services.
	   Interfax reported that heating and electricity supplies were
expected to resume Tuesday in the far northeastern Kamchatka
Peninsula if two tankers carrying fuel oil arrive on schedule.
	   Kamchatka has been without heat since Nov. 30.

Most seats for St. Petersburg elections go to runoffs

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Most local legislative seats up for
grabs in Russia's second largest city of St. Petersburg will go to
runoffs after an election that was marred by bomb threats and
complaints of voter fraud.
	   Officials said Monday that just six of 50 seats were decided in
Sunday's election for the St. Petersburg legislative assembly,
while the rest will go to runoffs scheduled for December 20.
	   The six seats were all held by incumbent assembly deputies.
Candidates must get more than 50 percent of the vote to win in the
first round or the top two vote winners face each other in a second
round.
	   Liberals took a prominent lead in the first round of voting,
with 22 members of the liberal Yabloko party and nine people from
various other reform-minded parties still in the race.
	   Ten communists, as well as the city's former police chief, a
movie actress and the author of a tell-all book about the former
mayor of St. Petersburg are also still in the running.
	   Observers were eager to see how the elections would reflect
public reaction to rising crime in St. Petersburg, as well as the
Nov. 20 killing of Galina Starovoitova, a member of the Russian
parliament who supported a liberal bloc of candidates in the
elections.
	   Starovoitova supporters speculated she was killed so that her
faction, Northern Capital, would fare poorly in the election. Her
death, however, may have had the opposite effect, rallying liberal
voters.
	   In addition, hitmen have killed a legislative aide, a
high-ranking city official and a prominent banker in the last two
months.
	   Dirty politics in St. Petersburg were reflected in the
elections, which were marred by violence, racial slurs against
Jewish candidates and complaints of ballot box stuffing.
	   The City Electoral Commission also reported complaints of voter
bribery, and bomb threats forced the temporary closure of three
stations.
	   Still, voter turnout was high by Russian standards _ around 40
percent.

Ex-attorney general attacks FBI agent's evidence

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark,
testifying in defense of a reputed Russian crime boss, today urged
a Swiss court to disregard evidence submitted last week by a
retired FBI agent.
	   Appearing as a defense witness for Sergei Mikhailov, Clark told
the Geneva correctional court that an American court would never
have allowed the testimony that Robert Levinson gave last Thursday.
	   ``He has never said that he went to Russia and personally
witnessed anything,'' said Clark, who served in the Johnson
administration.
	   Mikhailov, 40, is charged with membership in a criminal
organization. Swiss prosecutors allege that he is head of the
Moscow-based Solntsevskaya organization.
	   As a special FBI agent, Levinson said he spent four years
studying Russian organized crime and worked on the case against
Vyacheslav Ivankov, whom a New York court last year sentenced to
nearly 10 years in prison on charges including extortion.
	   Levinson said unnamed sources had told him that Mikhailov had
personally commanded two ``combat brigades'' specializing in
assassination and that his organization had taken over businesses
in several American cities.
	   But Clark said that Levinson had based his testimony on
``general information, gossip, reports from the media and
deliberately planted misinformation.''
	   As attorney general, Clark oversaw a sixfold increase in the
number of cases brought against organized crime figures, yet he
said it was not strange that he now was testifying for the defense
in such a case.
	   ``It is a healthy society where you can change from one side to
the other and an unhealthy society where you can't, if you are
looking for the truth,'' Clark said.
	   Mikhailov's trial is in its second week. If convicted he faces a
maximum prison term of seven and a half years.

robot arm and thruster rockets _ the hardest job of the mission _
two Endeavour astronauts will make three spacewalks to hook up all
the electrical connections and cables by hand.
	   The combined modules will jut 77 feet out of Endeavour's cargo
bay and have a mass of 70,000 pounds.
	   Zarya will provide power and propulsion. Unity is a cylindrical
passageway to which other pieces of the space station will be
attached.
	   The first attempt to launch Endeavour, on Thursday, ended after
an alarm in the cockpit went off with 4{ minutes remaining in the
countdown. A sensitive toggle switch in the hydraulic power system
was blamed.
	   Another alarm sounded within moments of Endeavour's arrival in
orbit Friday. One of three hydraulic power units had overheated,
and the pilots switched to a backup.
	   NASA said engineers are confident the problem will not affect
the 12-day flight. Endeavour is due back on Dec. 15.

Responding to crisis, Russia delivers food, fuel to needy areas

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia launched operations Friday to bring food
and fuel to needy outposts in the far northeast, where the
country's economic crisis has made a hard life even harder for many
people.
	   More than 30 tons of food were delivered to three places in the
Chukotka Peninsula, including Wrangel Island, where three
filmmakers were airlifted to safety earlier in the week after they
ran out of food.
	   Villagers on the island have also been running low on supplies,
and a helicopter brought one ton of vegetables to the village of
Ushakovsky as part of a larger arctic airlift, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   A fuel tanker left the southeastern port of Nakhodka with more
than 15,000 tons of fuel that it was taking to two ports on the
Chukotka Peninsula, one of many places in the northeast where fuel
supplies have become critically low as a result of the economic
crisis.
	   ITAR-Tass said the tanker Samotlor is expected to reach the
ports of Egvenkinot and Providence in a week, but will have to wait
for an icebreaker to lead it into port.
	   The entire sprawling Chukotka region, including the surrounding
islands, has about 80,000 people.
	   Meanwhile, in the southeastern territory of Primorsky, officials
announced a program to stockpile food reserves to protect people
from the effects of potentially steep price increases. Inflation is
expected to be over 70 percent this year.
	   In other signs of tough economic times:
	   _ Several hundred teachers in northern city of Arkhangelsk, who
have been on strike since Nov. 12, picketed the mayor's office and
city administration, demanding wages that haven't been paid for up
to five months, ITAR-Tass said.
	   _ Ambulance crews in the Ural Mountains city of Nizhny Tagil
held a two-hour warning strike during which they responded only to
extreme emergencies. They are demanding wages that haven't been
paid for four months.

Ship rescues scores of immigrants tossed into sea near Malta

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A Russian merchant ship rescued some 50 clandestine
immigrants who were tossed by their smugglers into the sea in the
waters south of Malta, Italian state television reported Sunday.
	   The smugglers apparently panicked when they saw the Russian ship
approach Saturday night in the Mediterranean about 90 miles south
of the island and threw the illegal immigrants into the water, the
RAI state TV report said.
	   About 10 people were believed missing, RAI said, and officials
aboard an Italian naval vessel helping in the rescue said there was
little hope the search would find any survivors Sunday in the
rough, cold waters.
	   Most of the immigrants were from Africa. RAI showed the
survivors, some of them wrapped in blankets, getting off the
Russian ship which brought them to Valletta, Malta's main port on
Sunday.
	   The smugglers were likely taking the people to Sicily, RAI said.
	   Thousands of people try to slip into Italy illegally to seek
work or families in Western Europe. Italy's long, largely
unpatrolled coasts attract smugglers, who pull up to beaches during
the night and drop off the immigrants who have paid thousands of
dollars for the voyage.

	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ A Russian merchant ship rescued 52
clandestine African immigrants from rough waters south of Malta,
but navy officials said Sunday there was little hope of finding
five missing people.
	   Authorities in Valletta, where the immigrants arrived Sunday,
said the immigrants had been aboard a rickety boat for two days
without food or water. They said it was unclear whether the people
had been abandoned by smugglers or set out on their own.
	   First reports said smugglers had tossed them into the sea before
fleeing when the Russian ship turned up some 90 miles south of
Malta, but it appeared that the immigrants had jumped into the sea
in hopes of being rescued when they spotted the Russians.
	   The would-be immigrants were apparently hoping originally to
reach Sicily, reports indicated.
	   Thousands of people try to slip into Italy illegally to seek
work or families in Western Europe. Italy's long, largely
unpatrolled coasts attract smugglers, who pull up to beaches during

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ The world's most elite construction
crew blazed into orbit Friday aboard space shuttle Endeavour to
begin assembling the international space station _ a complex and
risky project that could have its white-knuckle moments.
	   ``Let's go do this,'' said shuttle commander Robert Cabana,
eager to deliver the first American-made piece of the space station
after a year's delay and an exasperating, last-minute postponement
the day before.
	   ``Amen,'' launch control replied.
	   Endeavour lifted off at 3:35 a.m. with a brilliant white flash.
With that, the most massive construction project ever attempted in
space had begun: the building of a 1 million-pound outpost 250
miles above Earth.
	   On Sunday evening, after a round-the-world chase, Endeavour's
astronauts will capture Zarya, a space station piece put into orbit
by the Russians two weeks ago, and attach it to Unity, the
U.S.-built part on board the shuttle.
	   Forty-three more U.S. and Russian launches will be needed over
the next five years to haul up more than 100 space station parts.
And 162 spacewalks will be required for assembly and maintenance.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright joined other dignitaries
from around the world to watch the launch, and applauded the
16-nation project.
	   ``All day long I deal with disputes on the ground, countries
that can't get along, and it's great to look at this space station
endeavor,'' she said.
	   NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin acknowledged it will be
``rough'' building the space station with the Russians, whose cash
crunch had delayed Endeavour's flight for a year. Already, NASA has
funneled $60 million to the Russians to complete some crucial
equipment. Millions more will almost certainly be needed.
	   Russia's problems aside, Goldin warned of ``some white-knuckled
times'' in the years ahead. Some of the problems, in fact, will
eclipse the fire and collision aboard Mir last year, he said.
	   ``Remember: These astronauts are moving 20,000- and 40,000-pound
masses. They're not going to be able to pretrain for everything,''
he said. ``Problems could occur. Equipment could break.
Life-support systems could go down.''
	   Once Zarya and Unity are connected with the help of Endeavour's
robot arm and thruster rockets _ the hardest job of the mission _
two Endeavour astronauts will make three spacewalks to hook up all
the electrical connections and cables by hand.
	   The combined modules will jut 77 feet out of Endeavour's cargo
bay and have a mass of 70,000 pounds.
	   Zarya will provide power and propulsion. Unity is a cylindrical
passageway to which other pieces of the space station will be
attached.
	   The first attempt to launch Endeavour, on Thursday, ended after
an alarm in the cockpit went off with 4{ minutes remaining in the
countdown. A sensitive toggle switch in the hydraulic power system
was blamed.
	   Another alarm sounded within moments of Endeavour's arrival in
orbit Friday. One of three hydraulic power units had overheated,
and the pilots switched to a backup.
	   NASA said engineers are confident the problem will not affect
the 12-day flight. Endeavour is due back on Dec. 15.

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ The astronauts aboard space shuttle
Endeavour spent their first full day in orbit testing equipment
they'll need to begin assembling the international space station.
	   The task starts in earnest Sunday when a Russian-built module is
connected with a U.S. part.
	   Except for a ``minor hiccup'' with a camera the astronauts will
use to view the two modules as they are attached, all systems were
working today, NASA flight director Bob Castle said.
	   ``So far, things have gone very well,'' Castle said.
	   After finally blasting off early Friday _ following a year's
delay and an exasperating, last-second postponement the day before
_ Endeavour's crew of five Americans and one Russian were eager to
get started.
	   ``The crew's feeling awesome, and we're ready to go to work up
here,'' shuttle commander Robert Cabana told Mission Control.
	   On Sunday evening, the astronauts will capture Zarya, a space
station piece put into orbit by the Russians two weeks ago, and
attach it to Unity, the U.S.-built part on board the shuttle.
	   Astronaut Nancy Currie will use a 50-foot robot arm to latch the
two pieces together. Because the two components are too big to
allow Currie to see out the shuttle window, she will have to rely
on a computerized vision system to complete the task, the mission's
most challenging.
	   Later today, Currie will use the robot arm and vision system to
unstow Unity from the shuttle's cargo bay in preparation for
Sunday's rendezvous with Zarya.
	   During a checkout of the arm and vision system Friday night, one
of the cameras that will track the parts' alignment got stuck while
panning to the left. But the camera eventually unjammed, and Castle
said he did not expect it to remain a problem.
	   ``If it died completely, we have other cameras that can do'' the
job, he said.
	   The astronauts also tested spacesuits and jet-powered backpacks
that will be needed for three spacewalks in which all the
electrical connections and cables between Zarya and Unity will be
hooked up by hand.
	   The combined modules will jut 77 feet out of Endeavour's cargo
bay and have a mass of 70,000 pounds. Zarya will provide power and
propulsion. Unity is a cylindrical passageway to which other pieces
of the space station will be attached.
	   In all, 162 spacewalks will be required to assemble and maintain
the 1 million-pound outpost. Forty-three more U.S. and Russian
launches will be needed over the next five years to haul up more
than 100 space station parts.
	   Endeavour is due back on Dec. 15. NASA officials said Friday
that a problem during liftoff with one of the shuttle's three
hydraulic power units would not affect the 12-day flight. The unit
overheated, but the pilots switched to a backup controller to cool
it.

Government set to submit budget to parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government is set to submit its draft budget
for 1999 to parliament next week along with a package of tax bills,
the legislature's speaker said Saturday.
	   Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the State Duma, said he had been
told by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov that the government will
submit the draft budget to the lower house of parliament next
Friday, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The new budget will encompass the government's approach to
tackling the worst economic crisis since the Soviet era. Primakov
has previously said that the long-awaited 1999 budget would have to
include unspecified measures to cushion the blows suffered by the
economic setbacks of August.
	   The government has been delaying a debate on next year's budget
as it struggles to find ways to come up with enough money to meet
its expenses.
	   The government announced plans last week to cut taxes as part of
its overall economic strategy. The cuts will serve as a foundation
for the 1999 budget, according to Primakov.
	   The proposed budget has already come under attack, with the
military saying that trimmed military spending could prove fatal to
the Russian army.
	   The Defense Department newspaper, Krasnaya Svezda, said Friday
that the budget envisaged 93 billion rubles (dlrs 5.1 billion) for
the military, or 2.6 of the Gross Domestic Product.
	   ``The minimum level of defense expenses has been set by
President Boris Yeltsin at 3.5 percent of the GDP,'' the newspaper
said in a front-page article. ``The army needs 133 billion rubles
(dlrs 7.4 billion).''
	   ``Such a budget will be fatal for the army,'' the newspaper
said. ``There will be enough money for food and salaries,'' it
said, but not enough to buy new weapons or carry military maneuvers
or to provide the military with vital necessities.

Astronauts poised to connect American part with Russian module
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAULINE ARRILLAGA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Astronauts on board the shuttle
Endeavour were poised Sunday to connect American's first piece of
the international space station with a Russian module in the
initial step of the five-year construction project.
	   Endeavour was expected to meet up with the Russian-built Zarya
module Sunday afternoon. Then astronaut Nancy Currie will use a
50-foot robot arm to grab hold of the 44,000-pound cylinder and
attach it to the U.S. part, called Unity.
	   The job is the trickiest of the 12-day assembly mission. Currie
must mate the two parts without a direct line of sight, using only
a computerized vision system to align them.
	   The task is so challenging that NASA flight controllers built in
extra time in the crew's schedule to allow them to move slowly and
try again if the two modules aren't assembled on the first attempt.
	   ``We're going to take our time and be careful,'' flight director
Bob Castle said. ``We are prepared for problems.''
	   In a worst-case scenario, if Zarya and Unity could not be
connected with the robot arm, the astronauts could perform a
spacewalk on Monday to help mate the components by hand, Castle
said.
	   Endeavour trailed Zarya early Sunday by 4,400 miles and was
closing in on the module by 550 miles per orbit.
	   On Saturday, in preparation for the rendezvous with Zarya,
Endeavour's astronauts hoisted the 25,000-pound Unity chamber from
the shuttle cargo bay and snapped it onto a docking ring.
	   With only an inch of clearance on either side, Currie used the
robot arm to raise Unity about 13 feet before tilting it to an
upright position above the docking ring. She then lowered the
cylinder to within a few inches of the ring, and the pilots fired
Endeavour's thrusters to move the shuttle up just enough for the
pieces to snap together.

	   ROME (AP) _ A Russian ship rescued 50 illegal immigrants from
the waters off Malta after they were thrown overboard by their

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Endeavour's astronauts captured the
first piece of the international space station on Sunday, the
Russian-made Zarya control module that had to be connected to the
Unity chamber aboard the shuttle.
	   Commander Robert Cabana steered Endeavour to within several feet
of the solar-winged module. Then Nancy Currie reached out with the
shuttle robot arm and gently latched onto it as the spacecraft
soared some 240 miles above the Kazak-Russian border.
	   ``We have Zarya,'' announced a jubilant Cabana. ``We're halfway
home for the day.''
	   The most difficult part of the mission _ stacking the two giant
cylinders _ was still ahead. The job fell to Currie, the shuttle
crane operator who had deftly hoisted and repositioned Unity in the
cargo bay on Saturday.
	   The two station pieces are so big _ 77 feet from the tip of one
to the tip of the other with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds _
that Currie and her crewmates had to rely on a computerized vision
system and camera views, rather than direct line of sight. Such a
``blind'' docking had never been attempted before.
	   Mission Control gave the six astronauts plenty of time for the
tasks.
	   ``The main thing I've tried to do for the last two years working
on this flight is make sure we have time. We have margin on
everything,'' said flight director Bob Castle.
	   Before beginning their final approach to Zarya _ Russian for
Sunrise _ the astronauts had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket
launched last month from California.
	   Mission Control ordered the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters
to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk,
putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbiting debris.
The smaller gap would have been ``probably a little too close for
comfort,'' Mission Control said.
	   The bigger worry, by far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and
capture of Zarya, and its coupling with Unity.
	   The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never before handled an
object as massive as the 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, a power and
propulsion module that was launched from Kazakhstan on Nov. 20. It
will provide all of the necessary electricity and steering for the
fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be
launched next summer.
	   Minutes after Zarya's capture, Cabana called down that two
antennas on the module were still undeployed as Russian flight
controllers had feared. The antennas must be fully deployed for
Zarya's manual docking system to work; that system won't be needed
before next summer, officials said. The only other problem was with
a Zarya battery; the astronauts took up a replacement part.
	   The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, the first American-made
component, will serve as a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for
future modules.
	   In case Zarya and Unity could not be connected with the robot
arm, two spacewalking astronauts would have to manually fit them
together. The astronauts would be going out anyway Monday to attach
electrical connectors and cables between the two components.
	   In all, three spacewalks were planned for Endeavour's 12-day
flight.
	   NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be
needed after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex.
	   Once completed, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of
1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, and house up to
seven astronauts and cosmonauts.

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Endeavour's astronauts captured the
first piece of the international space station on Sunday, the
Russian-made Zarya control module that had to be connected to the
Unity chamber aboard the shuttle.
	   Commander Robert Cabana steered Endeavour to within several feet
of the solar-winged module. Then Nancy Currie reached out with the
shuttle robot arm and gently latched onto it as the spacecraft
soared some 240 miles above the Kazak-Russian border.
	   ``We have Zarya,'' announced a jubilant Cabana. ``We're halfway
home for the day.''
	   The most difficult part of the mission _ stacking the two giant
cylinders _ was still ahead. The job fell to Currie, the shuttle
crane operator who had deftly hoisted and repositioned Unity in the
cargo bay on Saturday.
	   The two station pieces are so big _ 77 feet from the tip of one

Jury finds Russian-born writer's bloody death was suicide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) _ A Russian-born writer and
lecturer who became increasingly eccentric in her last months
battered, mutilated, choked and stabbed herself to death, a
coroner's jury has ruled.
	   After four days of testimony and five hours of deliberation, the
panel ruled Friday that Lioudmila Boukina, 47, probably died just
before her husband returned home from a trip to Vancouver.
	   Boukina's body was found in a pool of blood against her bedroom
door in the Victoria home she shared with her husband, Nicholas
Galichenko, a University of Victoria professor who found her for
about 18 hours after she died.
	   The corpse bore puncture marks to the top of the head, neck,
arms, eyelids, and abdomen, bruises around the eyes and evidence of
strangulation.
	   There was no evidence of blood anywhere except by the body,
which blocked access to the room. The windows were locked from the
inside. Under the body lay an awl, a scarf and a belt.
	   Galichenko called authorities after forcing the door to her
separate bedroom. After an investigation, police concluded she had
killed herself but the case was submitted to a coroner's inquest to
resolve any questions.

Astronauts poised to connect American part with Russian module

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Endeavour's astronauts were poised
Sunday to connect America's first piece of the international space
station with a Russian module already in orbit, but first they had
to steer clear of a piece of space debris.
	   Early Sunday morning, the astronauts fired the shuttle's
thrusters for 6 seconds to provide additional clearance between
Endeavour and a spent rocket body spotted overnight by U.S. Space
Command, a Colorado Springs-based center that tracks satellites and
space junk.
	   NASA officials said the shuttle would have come within about 1.8
miles of the rocket casing without the additional maneuver. That is
considered a safe distance, but flight controllers didn't want to
chance it. Endeavour now is expected to pass about 5 miles from the
debris.
	   Mission Control told the crew the rocket casing ``was going to
come probably a little too close for comfort ... so we opted to be
on the safe side and do this extra burn now.''
	   The casing was part of a Delta II rocket launched Nov. 6 from
California's Vandenberg Air Force Base carrying five satellites for
a new global telecommunications system, NASA officials said.
	   The additional maneuver will leave Endeavour about 20 miles
farther from the Russian-built Zarya module than initially planned
when the astronauts begin approaching it. But flight controllers
said the shuttle could easily make up that distance with no impact
to the final rendezvous.
	   Endeavour was expected to meet up with Zarya on Sunday
afternoon. Then astronaut Nancy Currie will use a 50-foot robot arm
to grab hold of the 44,000-pound cylinder and attach it to the U.S.
part, called Unity.
	   The job is the trickiest of the 12-day assembly mission. Currie
must attach the two parts without a direct line of sight, using
only a computerized vision system to align them.
	   The task is so challenging that NASA flight controllers built in
extra time in the crew's schedule to allow them to move slowly and
try again if the two modules aren't assembled on the first attempt.
	   ``We're going to take our time and be careful,'' flight director
Bob Castle said. ``We are prepared for problems.''
	   In a worst-case scenario, if Zarya and Unity could not be
connected with the robot arm, the astronauts could perform a
spacewalk on Monday to help mate the components by hand, Castle
said.
	   Endeavour trailed Zarya early Sunday by 4,400 miles and was
closing in on the module by 550 miles per orbit.
	   On Saturday, in preparation for the rendezvous with Zarya,
Endeavour's astronauts hoisted the 25,000-pound Unity chamber from
the shuttle cargo bay and snapped it onto a docking ring.
	   With only an inch of clearance on either side, Currie used the
robot arm to raise Unity about 13 feet before tilting it to an
upright position above the docking ring. She then lowered the
cylinder to within a few inches of the ring, and the pilots fired
Endeavour's thrusters to move the shuttle up just enough for the
pieces to snap together.

	   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) _ A Russian-born writer and
lecturer who became increasingly eccentric in her last months
battered, mutilated, choked and stabbed herself to death, a
coroner's jury has ruled.
	   After four days of testimony and five hours of deliberation, the
panel ruled Friday that Lioudmila Boukina, 47, probably died
shortly just before her husband returned home from a trip to
Vancouver.
	   Boukina's body was found in a pool of blood against her bedroom
door in the home she shared with her husband, Nicholas Galichenko,
a University of Victoria professor who found her for about 18 hours

	   The corpse bore puncture marks to the top of the head, neck,

	   There was no evidence of blood anywhere except by the body,

	   Galichenko called authorities after forcing the door to her
separate bedroom. After an investigation, police concluded she had
killed herself but the case was submitted to a coroner's inquest to
resolve any questions.
	   Galichenko wasn't present when the verdict was returned but will
be relieved, said his lawyer, Adrian Brooks.
	   The jury ruled that Boukina stabbed herself with the awl, which
resembles an ice pick, and died of internal hemorrhaging from a
blow to the abdomen.
	   Two days earlier, a distraught Boukina called emergency
dispatchers, asked for protection and said she feared someone was
trying to kill her.
	   She was vague about the danger but said her husband was about to
divorce her.
	   Acquaintances described Boukina in terms ranging from eccentric
to seriously disturbed and obsessed with the dark side of life,
especially in the last months of her life.
	   At the same time, friends said she would never kill herself and
couldn't believe anyone could inflict such injuries on herself.
	   During the inquest, jurors heard testimony that a bearded
stranger was seen with Boukina the day she died. The man has never
been found.
	   Coroner's counsel John Orr said the ruling doesn't necessarily
mean the case is closed as far as police are concerned.
	   ``They keep an open mind on all cases,'' Orr said. ``There are
still a few unanswered questions _ for example, the bearded man.''

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Endeavour's astronauts faced their
first hurdle Saturday in building the international space station:
hoisting the 25,000-pound Unity chamber from the shuttle cargo bay,
with only an inch of clearance on either side.
	   An even tougher job awaits them Sunday, when they pluck a much
larger Russian station component from orbit and attach it to the
U.S. piece without a direct line of sight.
	   The six shuttle astronauts have been chasing the component named
Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) since they rocketed into orbit Friday.
As of midday Saturday, they trailed the giant cylinder by 7,000
miles.
	   Astronaut Nancy Currie flexed Endeavour's 50-foot robot arm in
preparation for all the lifting; the arm has never wielded such
massive objects before. She and her crewmates also checked the
computerized vision system she'll use to line up the two station
components; they're so big she won't be able to see where they meet
by looking out the window.
	   ``It's not so much a case of how difficult it is,'' Currie
explained before the flight, ``just how careful we have to be and
how time-consuming it is.''
	   Unity, the first American-made piece of the space station, will
serve as a connecting passageway once more modules arrive over the
next few years. It's 36 feet long and 15 feet in diameter, and is
composed of 50,000 mechanical parts, 216 fluid and gas lines, and
121 electrical cables containing a mind-boggling six miles of
wiring.
	   It barely fit in Endeavour's cargo bay, widthwise; there was
only an inch to spare on either side, making Currie's job
especially difficult. The last thing she wanted to do was bump
Unity against the shuttle while lifting it from its horizontal
position and setting it upright in preparation for Sunday's
coupling with Zarya.
	   The 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, launched Nov. 20 from
Kazakstan, contains all the power and propulsion systems needed for
the fledgling space station. Without Zarya, Unity would be a
useless, empty can in orbit.
	   ``I think Sunrise is very appropriate and I think Unity is very
appropriate for the new station because it's a new beginning and
we're all bound together,'' shuttle commander Robert Cabana said
from orbit.
	   Unity cost $300 million, Zarya $240 million. The National
Aeronautics and Space Administration paid for both.
	   NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin wondered aloud after Friday's
launch whether the astronauts would pull everything off.
	   ``We've practiced with robots. We've practiced with the
shuttle,'' Goldin said. ``But now we're doing the real thing with
hardware that cost a quarter of a billion dollars. Will we pull it
off? I'm going to worry every day.''

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Endeavour's astronauts overcame
their first hurdle Saturday in building the international space
station: hoisting the 25,000-pound Unity chamber from the shuttle
cargo bay, with only an inch of clearance on either side.
	   An even tougher job awaits them Sunday, when they attempt to
pluck a much larger Russian station component from orbit and attach
it to the U.S. piece without a direct line of sight.
	   The six shuttle astronauts have been chasing the component named
Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) since they rocketed into orbit Friday.
They trailed the giant cylinder by 7,000 miles late Saturday
afternoon.
	   Astronaut Nancy Currie used Endeavour's 50-foot robot arm to
lift Unity, the first American-made piece of the international
space station. She moved the precious load slowly _ so slowly it
almost appeared at first to be motionless.
	   ``Beautiful and delicate work,'' radioed Mission Control.
	   Currie raised Unity about 13 feet before tilting it to an
upright position above a docking ring in the bay. The next, and
final, step involved latching Unity onto the ring.
	   The jointed shuttle arm, which also will be used for handling
Zarya, has never wielded such massive objects before. The two
station components are so big that Currie won't be able to see
where they meet by looking out the window; she'll rely solely on a
computerized vision system to line them up, the first
``in-the-blind'' docking attempt of its kind.
	   ``It's not so much a case of how difficult it is,'' Currie
explained before the flight, ``just how careful we have to be and
how time-consuming it is.''
	   Unity will serve as a connecting passageway once more modules
arrive over the next few years. It's 36 feet long and 15 feet in
diameter, and is composed of 50,000 mechanical parts, 216 fluid and
gas lines, and 121 electrical cables containing a mind-boggling six
miles of wiring.
	   It barely fit in Endeavour's cargo bay, widthwise; there was
only an inch to spare on either side, making Currie's job
especially difficult. The last thing she wanted to do was bump
Unity against the shuttle while lifting it from its horizontal
position and setting it upright in preparation for Sunday's
coupling with Zarya.
	   The 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, launched Nov. 20 from
Kazakstan, contains all the power and propulsion systems needed for
the fledgling space station. Without Zarya, Unity would be a
useless, empty can in orbit.
	   ``I think Sunrise is very appropriate and I think Unity is very
appropriate for the new station because it's a new beginning and
we're all bound together,'' shuttle commander Robert Cabana said
from orbit.
	   Unity cost $300 million, Zarya $240 million. The National
Aeronautics and Space Administration paid for both.
	   NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin wondered aloud after Friday's
launch whether the astronauts would pull everything off.
	   ``We've practiced with robots. We've practiced with the
shuttle,'' Goldin said. ``But now we're doing the real thing with
hardware that cost a quarter of a billion dollars. Will we pull it
off? I'm going to worry every day.''

United States to send cash and grain to Georgia

	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ The United States is offering an aid
package to Georgia that will include $5 million in cash and 35,000
tons of wheat, a Georgian presidential aide said Sunday.
	   The aid package was unveiled at a meeting between President
Eduard Shevardnadze and U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Yallovic on
Saturday, Georgian spokesman Vakhtang Abashidze told reporters.
	   The cash will be used to support social programs in Georgia, he
said.
	   Meanwhile, Georgia has asked the International Monetary Fund for
loans to help it cope with the impact of poor grain harvests, a
lack of fuel and the economic crisis in neighboring Russia.
	   Georgia's central bank ceased propping up its currency, the
lari, and let it float freely, a move supported by the IMF, said
presidential aid Teimuraz Basilia.

Endeavour closes in to capture first station part
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Capture of Zarya scheduled for 6:46 p.m. EST, docking of two
components scheduled about 8:36 p.m. EST. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCIA DUNN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Aerospace Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Endeavour and its astronauts closed
in Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space
station, the Russian-made Zarya control module that had to be
connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle.
	   Stacking the two giant cylinders 240 miles above the Earth was
considered the most difficult part of the mission. The job fell to
Nancy Currie, the shuttle crane operator who had deftly hoisted and
repositioned Unity in the cargo bay on Saturday.
	   The two station pieces are so big _ 77 feet from the tip of one
to the tip of the other with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds _
that Currie and her crewmates were going to have to rely on a
computerized vision system and camera views, rather than direct
line of sight. Such a ``blind'' docking had never been attempted
before.
	   Mission Control gave the astronauts plenty of time for the
tasks.
	   ``The main thing I've tried to do for the last two years working
on this flight is make sure we have time. We have margin on
everything,'' said flight director Bob Castle.
	   Before beginning their final approach to Zarya _ Russian for
Sunrise _ the shuttle's six astronauts had to steer clear of a
chunk of a rocket launched last month from California.
	   Mission Control ordered the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters
to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk,
putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbiting debris.
The smaller gap would have been ``probably a little too close for
comfort,'' Mission Control said.
	   The bigger worry, by far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and
capture of Zarya, and its coupling with Unity.
	   The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never before been assigned
to handle an object as massive as the 44,000-pound Zarya, a power
and propulsion module that was launched from Kazakhstan on Nov. 20.
It will provide all the necessary electricity and steering for the
fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be
launched next summer.
	   The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity will serve as a connecting
passageway, or vestibule, for future modules.
	   In case Zarya and Unity could not be connected with the robot
arm, two spacewalking astronauts would have to manually fit them
together. The astronauts would be going out anyway Monday to attach
electrical connectors and cables between the two components.
	   In all, three spacewalks were planned for Endeavour's 12-day
flight.
	   NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be
needed after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex.
	   Once completed, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of
1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, and house up to
seven astronauts and cosmonauts.

Astronauts successfully connect first two station parts

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Endeavour's astronauts connected
the first two building blocks of the international space station on
Sunday, creating a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay.
	   It was the first time that the Russian-built Zarya control
module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched. It
looked to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit.
	   ``We have capture of Zarya,'' commander Robert Cabana announced
the two pieces came together.
	   ``Congratulations to the crew of the good ship Endeavour,''
replied Mission Control. ``That's terrific.''
	   The 240-mile-high construction job began two hours earlier with
Nancy Currie's capture of Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) using the
shuttle robot arm. ``We're halfway home,'' Cabana said.
	   Then came the hard part: stacking the two giant cylinders in the
cargo bay.
	   The two station pieces are so big _ 77 feet from the tip of one
to the tip of the other with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds _
that Currie and her crewmates had to rely on a computerized vision
system and camera views, rather than direct line of sight. This was
the first time such a ``blind'' docking had ever been attempted.
	   Currie positioned the solar-winged Zarya, still on the end of
the shuttle robot arm, several inches directly above Unity. It was
slow going; she wanted and needed perfect alignment.
	   Once she was sure she had it, Cabana fired Endeavour's
thrusters, and the brief burst raised the shuttle and thereby Unity
enough for the docking mechanisms on the two station components to
snap together. The historical moment occurred above the South
Pacific.
	   The union _ intended to last the station's 15-year or more
lifetime _ set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on
Monday to attach electrical connectors and cables between the two
components.
	   Mission Control thought Sunday's work might take hours longer
than planned and gave the six astronauts plenty of time for the
tasks. But everything occurred more or less when and how it was
supposed to, aside from a piece of space junk that strayed too
close.
	   Before beginning their final approach to Zarya, the six
astronauts had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launched last
month from California.
	   Mission Control ordered the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters
to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk,
putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbiting debris.
The smaller gap would have been ``probably a little too close for
comfort,'' Mission Control said.
	   The bigger worry, by far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and
capture of Zarya, and its coupling with Unity.
	   The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never before handled an
object as massive as the 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, a power and
propulsion module that was launched from Kazakstan on Nov. 20. It
will provide all of the necessary electricity and steering for the
fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be
launched next summer.
	   Minutes after Zarya's capture, Cabana called down that two
antennas on the module were still undeployed as Russian flight

KLA accuses Serbs of ambushes, seeks more withdrawals

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo Albanian rebels accused Serb
forces Sunday of launching unprovoked attacks in the shooting
deaths of more than a dozen ethnic Albanians in the past few days.
	   They said more Serb forces must pull back in order to avoid more
violence in the tense standoff between the two sides, which have
clashed sporadically since an October peace agreement.
	   To add muscle to that agreement, the advance party of a NATO
European military force arrived Sunday in neighboring Macedonia to
be on standby to rescue, if necessary, the international civilians
trying to verify compliance with the October accord.
	   But the recent killings in Kosovo have heightened fears
full-scale combat may resume soon after halting two months ago when
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a withdrawal of
many forces from the separatist Serbian province.
	   In a statement published in the ethnic Albanian newspaper Koha
Ditore, the Kosovo Liberation Army blamed the Serbs for the
escalation of violence, saying they had attacked both villages and
KLA positions despite the cease-fire.
	   The two deadliest recent shootings _ the killings of three
ethnic Albanians by unidentified assailants in Pristina and of
eight KLA fighters by border guards on the Albanian border _ were
Serb ambushes, the rebels said.
	   They disputed the position of international officials that both
sides are to blame for the rising violence in Kosovo.
	   ``It is unacceptable for the international community to equate
the KLA with Serb forces'' and hold both responsible, the statement
said.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is coordinating an international monitoring mission in Kosovo,
condemned Kosovo violence last week but declined to single out
either side in the recent shootings.
	   Some 500 unarmed verifiers now patrol Kosovo daily _ a total
that is rising almost daily as the OSCE tries to put about 2,000 on
duty in the province.
	   Driving through tense villages in bright orange trucks, the
verifiers have brought a sense of added security for ethnic
Albanians even though they have no weapons.
	   ``Hopefully, the deployment of the OSCE verification mission
will create a new environment, a new atmosphere,'' ethnic Albanian
political Ibrahim Rugova said Friday.
	   In the Macedonian capital Skopje, four huge French Hercules
military planes with about 30 military officers and 40 tons of
equipment landed Sunday in driving wind and snow to set up the NATO
force to protect the civilian verifiers.
	   Over the next two weeks, the force will grow up to a 1,700-man
NATO mission, led by France. The force will include about 700
French, 350 British and 200 soldiers each from Italy, Germany and
the Netherlands.
	   If the Kosovo peace verifiers run into trouble, the NATO
soldiers will swiftly engage in a cross-border action from
Macedonia to extract them and bring to safety.
	   ``We are glad to be here, but I hope we have no job to do in
Kosovo,'' Lt. Col. Charles de Kersabiec told reporters.
	   In its statement Sunday, the KLA said it has urged international
officials to push for Serb withdrawals from several more positions,
including the town of Malisevo which had been a rebel stronghold.
	   The guerrillas also said the Serbs should stop patrolling some
roads so that the population feels more secure.
	   Precise details of allowed Serb deployments in Kosovo were not
specified in the October agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
	   The embattled southern province has a population of 2 million,
consisting mainly of ethnic Albanians.
	   Serbia, which is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, used force
this year to try to crush separatist rebels and keep Kosovo from
seceding. Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanian civilians,
were killed and as many as 300,000 were displaced from their homes.
	   Dozens have been killed since the October agreement. In the
latest violence, the ethnic Albanians' Council for the Defense of
Human Rights said a Serb sniper killed an Albanian Saturday in
Klina, 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Pristina.
	   In the Yugoslav capital Belgrade, a delegation of the Russian
parliament, or Duma, met Sunday with Serbian officials in a gesture
of support for the government. The delegation is headed by Sergei
Glotov, leader of the anti-NATO faction.
	   ``The (Russian) delegation confirmed its stand... supporting
peaceful solution of Kosovo (crisis) and for preserving territorial
integrity and sovereignty of Serbia and Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia'' the government's Tanjug news agency reported.

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Endeavour's astronauts connected
the first two building blocks of the international space station on
Sunday, creating a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay.
	   It was the first time that the Russian-built Zarya control
module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched. It
looked to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit.
	   ``We have capture of Zarya,'' commander Robert Cabana announced
the moment the two pieces came together.
	   ``Congratulations to the crew of the good ship Endeavour,''
replied Mission Control. ``That's terrific.''
	   The 240-mile-high construction job began two hours earlier with
Nancy Currie's capture of Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) using the
shuttle robot arm. ``We're halfway home,'' Cabana said.
	   Then came the hard part: stacking the two giant cylinders in the
cargo bay.
	   The two station pieces are so big _ 77 feet from the tip of one
to the tip of the other with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds _
that Currie and her crewmates had to rely on a computerized vision
system and camera views, rather than direct line of sight. This was
the first time such a ``blind'' docking had ever been attempted.
	   Currie positioned the solar-winged Zarya, still on the end of
the shuttle robot arm, several inches directly above Unity. It was
slow going; she wanted and needed perfect alignment.
	   Once she was sure she had it, Cabana fired Endeavour's
thrusters, and the brief burst raised the shuttle and thereby Unity
enough for the docking mechanisms on the two station components to
snap together. The historical moment occurred above the South
Pacific.
	   The union _ intended to last the station's 15-year or more
lifetime _ set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on
Monday to attach electrical connectors and cables between the two
components.
	   Mission Control thought Sunday's work might take hours longer
than planned and gave the six astronauts plenty of time for the
tasks. But everything occurred more or less when and how it was
supposed to, aside from a piece of space junk that strayed too
close.
	   Before beginning their final approach to Zarya, the six
astronauts had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launched last
month from California.
	   Mission Control ordered the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters
to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk,
putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbiting debris.
The smaller gap would have been ``probably a little too close for
comfort,'' Mission Control said.
	   The bigger worry, by far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and
capture of Zarya, and its coupling with Unity.
	   The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never before handled an
object as massive as the 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, a power and
propulsion module that was launched from Kazakstan on Nov. 20. It
will provide all of the necessary electricity and steering for the
fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be
launched next summer.
	   Minutes after Zarya's capture, Cabana called down that two
antennas on the module were still undeployed as Russian flight
controllers had feared. The antennas must be fully deployed in
order for Zarya's manual docking system to work; that system won't
be needed before next summer, officials said. The only other
problem was with a Zarya battery; the astronauts took up a
replacement part.
	   The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, the first American-made

	   It was crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not

	   In all, three spacewalks are planned for Endeavour's 12-day

The joined modules will be released from Endeavour once all of the

	   The union _ intended to last the station's 15-year or more
lifetime _ set the stage for a spacewalk by two astronauts on
Monday to attach electrical connectors and cables between the two
components. It also made NASA managers feel good about the assembly
flights to come.
	   ``Bringing these two components together in this way ... I think
is a good omen for what's coming ahead,'' said Frank Culbertson,
deputy program manager for space station operations.
	   Mission Control thought Sunday's work might take hours longer
than planned and gave the six astronauts plenty of time for the
tasks. But everything occurred more or less when and how it was
supposed to, aside from a piece of space junk that strayed too

	   Minutes after Zarya's capture, Cabana called down that two
antennas on the module were still undeployed, as Russian flight
controllers had suspected. The long, strip-style antennas must be
rolled open in order for Zarya's backup docking system to work;
that system won't be needed before next summer, officials said.
NASA was considering having Endeavour's spacewalkers pull open the
stuck antennas later in the week.
	   The only other problem was with a Zarya battery; the astronauts
took up a replacement part.
	   The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity, the first American-made
component, will serve as a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for
future modules.
	   It was crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not
be connected with the robot arm, NASA would have sent out two
spacewalking astronauts to manually fit them together.
	   In all, three spacewalks are planned for Endeavour's 12-day
flight, not only to hook up electrical connections between the two
modules but to install handrails and other tools for future crews.
The joined modules will be released from Endeavour once all of the
work is completed.
	   NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be
needed after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex.
	   Once completed, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of
1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, and house up to
seven astronauts and cosmonauts.

Two space station parts joined; astronauts' spacewalk next

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ The first two building blocks of
the international space station were firmly hooked together and
soaring high above the Earth today, awaiting a visit from two
spacewalking astronauts to attach electrical connectors and cables
between the parts.
	   During the 6{-hour spacewalk, scheduled to begin this evening,
astronauts Jerry Ross and James Newman will hook up 40 connectors
to supply power to the fledgling outpost. Newman likened the job to
construction work.
	   ``Essentially we're putting an office building together,'' he
explained.
	   Two other spacewalks are planned during the 12-day assembly
mission, to install handrails and other tools for future crews.
	   The first two space station parts _ the Russian-built Zarya
control module and American-made Unity chamber _ were connected on
Sunday, creating a seven-story tower out of the cargo bay of the
shuttle Endeavour. The joined modules will be released from the
shuttle once all of the spacewalks are completed.
	   The components were linked as Endeavour soared 240 miles over
the South Pacific.
	   Astronaut Nancy Currie used the shuttle's robot arm to grab hold
of Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) and position it several inches
directly above Unity. Then shuttle commander Robert Cabana fired
Endeavour's thrusters, raising it enough for the docking mechanisms
on the two station components to snap together.
	   ``We have capture of Zarya,'' Cabana announced the moment the
pieces came together.
	   ``Congratulations to the crew of the good ship Endeavour,''
replied Mission Control. ``That's terrific.''
	   The task took several hours because the two parts needed to be
perfectly aligned before they were joined, and the pieces are so
big _ 77-feet long with a combined mass of 70,000 pounds _ that the
astronauts had to rely on a computerized vision system and camera
views, rather than direct line of sight.
	   This was the first time such a ``blind'' docking had ever been
attempted, and Currie was credited with a flawless performance _
lining up the parts so they were only half a degree and less than
an inch off-center.
	   A problem was detected with two antennas on the Zarya module
that failed to deploy. The antennas must be unfurled in order for
Zarya's backup docking system to work. That system won't be needed
before next summer, but NASA is considering having Ross and Newman
unroll them during a spacewalk.
	   A Zarya battery also was not working properly, but the
astronauts took up a replacement part.
	   Despite the glitches, NASA officials lauded the first step of
space station assembly as a success.
	   ``This is history,'' said Frank Culbertson, deputy program
manager for space station operations. ``Bringing these two
components together in this way ... I think is a good omen for
what's coming ahead.''
	   NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be
needed to assemble the entire orbiting complex, scheduled for
completion in 2004. Once constructed, the station will have a mass
of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field and house up
to seven astronauts and cosmonauts.

Hungary expects to be admitted to NATO in March
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary will be given membership in
NATO in March, Defense Minister Janos Szabo was cited as saying on
Monday.
	   ``According to the latest reports we have, Hungary will be a
full member of NATO in March,'' Szabo said, according to state
radio.
	   There was no word from Poland and the Czech Republic _ the other
two former Soviet bloc nations expected to join the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization next year. But with membership for all three
considered a package, the Hungarian announcement indicated that the
other two would also be offered full NATO status in March.
	   The three had been expected to be given full membership in April
at a Washington ceremony marking the organization's 50th birthday.
Szabo's announcement appeared to confirm speculation that the date
would be changed to avoid slighting Russia, which also will be
attending the anniversary ceremonies.
	   Moscow opposes expansion of NATO and is particularly against its
former allies becoming members.

	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ A Russian-flagged Italian survey ship
rescued 52 clandestine African immigrants from rough waters south
of Malta, but navy officials said Sunday there was little hope of
finding five missing people.
	   Authorities in Valletta, where the immigrants arrived Sunday,
said the immigrants had been aboard a rickety wooden boat for two
days without food or water.
	   Survivors told police and military officials that their voyage
of hope had begun in various African ports where they were picked
up a ship. But after some days, the crew put them in the wooden
craft and abandoned them, the officials said.
	   When crew aboard the ship that came to their aid told them they
would be taken aboard, the immigrants, too anxious to wait, jumped
into the waters about 90 miles south of Malta and started swimming
toward the Akademia Nicolas Starakov, which then plucked them up.
	   The would-be immigrants were apparently hoping originally to
reach Sicily, reports indicated.
	   Thousands of people try to slip into Italy illegally to seek
work or families in Western Europe. Italy's long, largely
unpatrolled coasts attract smugglers, who pull up to beaches during
the night and drop off the immigrants who have paid thousands of
dollars for the voyage.

United States to send cash and grain to Georgia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ The United States is putting together an
aid package for Georgia that will include dlrs 5 million in cash
and 35,000 tons of wheat, a presidential aide said Sunday.
	   The aid package was unveiled at a meeting Saturday between
President Eduard Shevardnadze and U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Yallovic,
presidential spokemsan Vakhtang Abashidze told reporters.
	   The cash will be used to support social programs in Georgia, he
said.
	   Georgia's central bank, meanwhile, has ceased propping up the
lari and introduced a floating rate for the currency, according to
Teimuraz Basilia, a presidential economic aide.
	   He said the decision allowing the currency to float freely has
the full support of the International Monetary Fund.
	   Georgia has asked the IMF to help cope with the impact of
Russia's economic crisis, poor harvests and a lack of fuel.
	   A drought last summer halved Georgia's grain harvest and caused
a significant reduction in hydroelectric output. The power shortage
has already forced authorities to ration energy and residents of
Tbilisi are getting electricity for just six hours a day.
	   Basilia said the German government plans to extend a 40-year
credit of 63 million marks (dlrs 37 million) to Georgia to restore
a number of electric power plants on Vartsikhe river in the
Southern Georgia.

Ukrainian opposition activists protest Swiss arrest of their

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Dozens of Ukrainian opposition party
activists and lawmakers demonstrated Monday near the Swiss Embassy
in Kiev to protest the arrest of their leader in Switzerland on
money-laundering charges.
	   The protesters, from the centrist Hromada movement, held
placards that read: ``Hands off the leader of Hromada!'' and
``Switzerland, stop playing political games!''
	   Hromada chief and former Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko, 45, who
is now a lawmaker in the Ukrainian parliament, was detained last
Wednesday as he drove from France into Switzerland. Swiss
authorities charged him in a money-laundering scheme on Friday.
	   According to investigating Judge Laurent Kasper-Ansermet, a
``relatively large'' sum of money had been seized in Geneva in
connection with the charges against Lazarenko.
	   Last month, Swiss federal police announced that Switzerland was
helping Ukrainian authorities track down money Lazarenko allegedly
stashed in Swiss banks. Switzerland has handed over some bank
documents to Ukraine, and investigations are underway in several
Swiss states.
	   Ukrainian authorities are already investigating whether
Lazarenko and other Hromada leaders have been involved in
corruption.
	   Lazarenko was prime minister from 1996 to 1997, and was
dismissed by President Leonid Kuchma. Critics say Lazarenko reaped
huge profits from the distribution of natural gas supplies in the
former Soviet republic when he served as prime minister, but he and
his allies deny the charges.
	   Lazarenko says the authorities want to discredit him before
presidential elections in October 1999, and he has even accused
Kuchma's close entourage of plotting to kill him.
	   Lazarenko's party fared well in parliamentary elections this
year and he was widely considered a top contender in the future
presidential race. His arrest appears to deal his chances a severe
blow.
	   Several Hromada legislators from among Monday's protesters met
with the Swiss ambassador, presenting the embassy with a letter
that said Lazarenko's arrest was a ``planned action of reprisal
against a politician whose party is in the opposition,'' the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Lazarenko's initial term of arrest is eight days. A hearing is
expected this week and Kasper-Ansermet, the judge, has said he
would ask to detain the Ukrainian politician until trial.
	   An investigator from Switzerland was expected to arrive in
Ukraine Monday for meetings with his Ukrainian counterparts
investigating Lazarenko's case, said Tetiana Zadorozhna, one of the
protesting legislators.

<TEXT>
	   DARTFORD, England (AP) _ Police have detained 103 Romanians in
what they contend may be the largest single roundup of suspected
illegal immigrants in Britain.
	   The Romanians were arrested Thursday at Dartford International
Ferry Terminal, east of London, where they arrived after traveling
by ferry from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge, police said.
	   Inspector Dave Berry said officers spent more than two hours
locating the people and transporting them to four police stations.
Those detained include children, police said.
	   ``This is certainly the largest number that I've heard of,''
Berry said. ''We sometimes see about 15 at a time, I've never seen
this number before.''
	   Immigration officials planned to interview the Romanians on
Friday.

Jilted groom's family rents a bride to stand in
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ When a young Romanian man was jilted
days before his wedding, his parents came up with a solution: They
rented a bride.
	   Determined to save their 22-year-old son Lucian's honor and not
lose money spent on nuptials, the family also rented parents for
the bride, the Evenimentul Zilei newspaper reported.
	   For days, the ``bride,'' a childhood friend named Mariana,
rehearsed lines and practiced the ceremony with the groom. Lucian's
family agreed that in exchange for her trouble, Mariana would
receive $100.
	   In Romania, wedding guests give money to help defray costs. If
the wedding had been canceled, the family would have lost the
hundreds of dollars it had spent.
	   But only two-thirds of the guests came, and some, surprised by
the new bride, weren't as generous as expected. As a result,
Mariana received only $3 instead of the $100 she was promised.
	   And that isn't her only headache: Apparently, Lucian has fallen
for her and wants the marriage to last.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Cleopa, a charismatic Romanian monk
persecuted by communists and admired by pilgrims, died Wednesday.
He was 87.
	   Hounded by the Securitate communist secret police who feared his
popular appeal, Cleopa fled to the forest in 1953 and built an
underground den, where he lived in hiding for almost a decade.
	   Born into a family of peasants in a village in northern Romania,
Cleopa became a monk at 25. After he entered the monastery he
worked as a shepherd for 12 years.
	   He was best known for his understanding of ordinary peoples'
problems and his healing words. Tens of thousands sought his
advice, both under communism and in the years of hardship that
followed the toppling of communist rule in 1989.
	   Romanian Orthodox monks are buried sitting in a chair, which is
lowered directly into the ground.
 &UR; Arthur Groman
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Arthur Groman, a trial lawyer whose
entertainment and business clients included major Hollywood
studios, Howard Hughes, Judy Garland and Armand Hammer, died
Tuesday. He was 84.
	   Groman had been with the law firm Mitchell, Silberberg &AMP; Knupp
since 1944. His most recent well-known client was the Fred Goldman
family, in its civil lawsuit against O.J. Simpson over the slaying
of Goldman's son Ron along with Nicole Brown Simpson.
	   Groman served on the board of directors of Hammer's Occidental
Petroleum Co. and was secretary of the Armand Hammer Museum. When
Hammer faced federal prosecution in the 1970s for campaign
financing violations, Groman and Washington lawyer Louis Nizer
defended him and arranged a guilty plea to misdemeanors.
	   Groman's other clients included RKO, Columbia, Paramount and MGM
studios, Norton Simon, Edward G. Robinson, Warren Beatty, Paul
Newman, Mick Jagger and Jack Kent Cooke.

	   The cause of death was not immediately clear and an autopsy was
ordered. Investigating judge Daniel Regenmass said there was no
indication of violence.
	   Silver, who had Canadian and Swiss citizenship, spent the last

	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Kerry Thornley, author of a book about Lee Harvey
Oswald written in part before he was charged with assassinating
President John F. Kennedy, died Saturday of cardiac arrest. He was
60.
	   Thornley became friends with Oswald in 1959 when both were in
the Marines in California. He began writing ``The Idle Warriors,''
the story of a disillusioned Marine who defects to the Soviet
Union, after Oswald defected.
	   He finished the manuscript in 1962 and was called before the
Warren Commission. He testified about Oswald's apparent fascination
with Communism. He then was hauled into court by New Orleans
District Attorney Jim Garrison, who accused him of conspiring to
kill the president.
	   Thornley's manuscript eventually was published in 1991 after
gathering dust as evidence seized by the commission.

Kosovo rebels reject political compromise, new shootouts erupt

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo rebels refused Friday to
accept anything short of independence, rejecting a key element of a
U.S.-proposed settlement as new border shootings put dangerous
strains on the province's fragile peace.
	   Escalating violence in Kosovo, including a shootout Friday in
the province's second-largest city, has lent new urgency to
American-led efforts to get Serbs and ethnic Albanians to agree on
a plan for Kosovo's future. Thirteen ethnic Albanians have been
reported killed this week.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army dealt a further setback to diplomacy
Friday, dismissing recent signals that the rebels were ready to
support a U.S. proposal.
	   The ethnic Albanian guerrillas said in a statement distributed
in Pristina that they won't accept any political solution ``which
would harm the ideals of our people toward independence, or which
would cement, even temporarily, an imposed joint life in an
anti-Albanian, anti-democratic'' system.
	   A KLA political representative signaled last week that the
rebels were ready to postpone independence and accept a plan giving
ethnic Albanians greater self-rule. But the KLA said Friday it was
``undeterred'' in its ``just fight until our independent and
democratic state is established.''
	   The rebels said they would publish a detailed response later on
a revised U.S. plan, which called for an interim political status
for Kosovo and was distributed to the Serb and ethnic Albanian
sides this week.
	   A Western diplomat, who declined to be named, called news of the
KLA's rejection discouraging.
	   Dozens of people have died in sporadic clashes since an Oct. 12
peace agreement halted more than seven months of combat in the
secessionist Serbian province, which is populated overwhelmingly by
ethnic Albanians.
	   Ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova renewed his call
for international military intervention in the wake of the latest
violence.
	   ``NATO ground troop deployment would provide a greater sense of
security,'' he said at a news conference.
	   The flareup in violence this week is ``a sign that we need a
special security force which will protect citizens and stop
violence in Kosovo,'' Rugova said.
	   A reported clash Friday that killed a woman in the western town
of Pec raised the death toll from the last three days to 13 _ all
ethnic Albanians.
	   The Serb-run Media Center said six people also were wounded in a
shootout that erupted after a man and woman attacked a Serb
policeman guarding Pec's hospital. The two reportedly shot and
wounded the policeman, then fired his automatic rifle and also
injured five bystanders.
	   The Serb center said the female attacker was killed by other
guards while her partner escaped.
	   In other reported violence, Yugoslav border guards reportedly
shot at 10 ethnic Albanians who tried to cross illegally into
Yugoslavia from Albania and allegedly fired at the guards first.
	   The shooting, which could not be independently confirmed, came a
day after Yugoslav army border guards said they shot and killed
eight ethnic Albanians trying to enter Kosovo from Albania.
	   That was the single worst breach of the informal, 2-month-old
cease-fire.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is assembling a force of 2,000 unarmed international verifiers in
Kosovo, declined to single out Serb forces or Kosovo rebels for the
rising violence.
	   ``Both sides are in this conflict are guilty of violating the
cease-fire agreement,'' it said, condemning violence ``from any
quarter.''
	   A KLA commander, however, disputed the army's account of
Thursday's killings, saying they were refugees returning to their
village of Velika Krusa in southwestern Kosovo _ not guerrillas
launching an attack.
	   The commander, who gave his name as Sylemetaj, said six of the
dead were students and most were from the same family.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 were left
homeless after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic launched a
crackdown last February against rebels who demand independence for
Kosovo.

Polish president vetoes bill allowing partial release of secret
</HEADLINE>
files &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland's president on Friday vetoed a bill
that would have allowed victims of communist-era repression to see
their secret police files.
	   The bill would have set up an institute to collect communist
files from 1944-89, as well as documents of Stalinist and Nazi
crimes. The bill would have allowed victims to learn who informed
on them.
	   Aleksander Kwasniewski, a former communist, argued that a court
_ not the commission _ should decide who was a victim. He also
wanted all citizens to have access to the files, according to
presidential lawyer Ryszard Kalisz.
	   The bill now goes back to parliament, where the powerful lower
chamber, or Sejm, can override Kwasniewski's veto if it approves
the measure by more than a 60 percent majority. But the governing
coalition headed by Solidarity lacks enough seats to guarantee an
override, and officials said Friday they would prepare a new bill.
	   ``This decision shows that the president wants to block the
truth about our history,'' said Solidarity chairman Marian
Krzaklewski.
	   Another bill that requires government officials to declare if
they ever worked for or collaborated with the former security
service went into effect last week. Anyone making a false
declaration could lose their job.
	   The issue of disclosing the past is divided along political
lines. The former communists are at the vanguard of the leftist
political parties that oppose dredging up such information, while
the anti-communist opposition have pushed to reveal all.
	   The ex-communists say the files are incomplete and any
information in them might be inaccurate due to the uncontrolled
work of the Security Service, which was disbanded in 1990.
	   ``I have a feeling ... that there will be a lot of harm,'' said
Jozef Oleksy, an ex-communist who was forced to resign as prime
minister in 1996 amid allegations put forward by the secret service
that he was an informer for the KGB, the former Russian secret
police and intelligence agency. A military prosecutor later cleared
Oleksy of any wrongdoing.
	   ``The accusation is printed in big letters on front pages while
... the apology either never gets printed or it is published in a
very narrow circulation,'' he said.
	   But Solidarity founder Lech Walesa, the first post-communist
president, said the present generation must pay the price for
Poland's tragic past.
	   ``There will be victims, but you cannot settle this problem
without victims,'' he said.

Former prime minister detained on money laundering charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Swiss authorities charged former Ukrainian Prime
Minister Pavlo Lazarenko on Friday in a money laundering scheme.
	   Lazarenko, 45, was arrested Wednesday by customs officials as he
drove from France into Switzerland. He was fired last year by
President Leonid Kuchma for alleged corruption.
	   Investigating Judge Laurent Kasper-Ansermet said a ``relatively
large'' sum of money had been seized in Geneva in connection with
the charges against Lazarenko.
	   Last month, the federal police announced Switzerland was helping
Ukrainian authorities track down money Lazarenko allegedly stashed
in Swiss banks. Switzerland has handed over some bank documents to
Ukraine, and investigations are under way in several Swiss states.
	   Lazarenko will initially be held for eight days. But
Kasper-Ansermet said he would ask at a hearing next week to detain
him until trial.
	   Lazarenko was prime minister from 1996 to 1997, and now leads
the centrist opposition Hromoda party.
	   His lawyer told the daily Le Temps newspaper Friday that
Lazarenko's opponents were trying to discredit him before
presidential elections next year.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ An unruly passenger died aboard a Malev
Hungarian airliner on Saturday after being strapped to his seat and
injected with tranquilizers.
	   The passenger, identified by Turkey's Anatolia news agency as

made an emergency landing in Istanbul. His hometown was not
available.
	   Anatolia and Hungary's MTI news agency said the man started

allegedly punched a pilot and tried to choke an attendant.
	   The crew and passengers tied him to his seat and a doctor aboard
gave him an injection.
	   An autopsy done later in the day showed he died because of the
mixture of the tranquilizer and some other drug or alcohol.
Witnesses saw the man take a pill before he became violent and
authorities suspected he was drunk, Anatolia said.
	   The crew and the doctor are being interrogated at the airport. A
new crew from Hungary was expected to fly the jet to Budapest with
189 other passengers later Saturday.

Official: IMF, World Bank delay aid to Ukraine over stalled
</HEADLINE>
reforms &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine will not get new loan installments
from the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank until it
approves a 1999 budget and introduces a series of reforms, a senior
official said Monday.
	   The IMF postponed the latest tranche of a dlrs 2.2 billion loan,
slated for release in September, because of the government's poor
tax collection and sluggish reforms in key sectors of the economy,
including energy and agriculture.
	   An IMF delegation visited Kiev last week and urged the
government to work harder on administrative and tax reforms issues
to qualify for the fund's aid, presidential adviser Valery
Lytvytsky said.
	   The loan was approved in September but Ukraine has seen only
dlrs 335 million of it so far.
	   He said the IMF would send another delegation to Ukraine next
month to evaluate the government's reform progress and analyze the
new 1999 budget in order to decide on whether to continue providing
its aid.
	   ``Approval of a realistic 1999 budget is a primary task,''
without which Ukraine can hardly hope for further disbursement of
the IMF loan, Lytvytsky said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Parliament postponed debate of the 1999 budget draft last week
after saying the government's revenue projections were too high,
and is scheduled to discuss the document again Wednesday.
	   The delay also automatically put off further disbursement of the
World Bank's own aid package _ which depends on the IMF's positive
assessment of the Ukrainian government's reform policies.
	   The World Bank approved its dlrs 950 million in loans to Ukraine
following approval of the IMF loan, and has already provided dlrs
340 million.
	   World Bank regional director Paul Siegelbaum told a news
conference in Kiev on Monday that the World Bank might even cut its
cooperation with Ukraine in the future if the former Soviet
republic's leftist-leaning legislature continues to obstruct
introduction of bank-developed projects.
	   Several such projects already have been suspended because
parliament failed to ratify them.
	   Ukraine badly needs foreign loans to replenish its hard currency
reserves, now at around dlrs 1 billion, so it can pay off
obligations on debt in 1999.
	   Government officials have acknowledged that Ukraine does not
have reliable sources of foreign aid for 1999 except for the IMF
and the World Bank because foreign investors have largely fled the
region following Russia's economic crisis, which struck in
mid-August.

Former secret police agent sentenced to 12 years for embezzlement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A former spy for the feared Communist
secret police was sentenced to 12 years in prison Friday for
embezzling more than $200,000 from a bank account, a news agency
reported.
	   In the 1980s, Nicolae Nadejde, a colonel in the dreaded
Securitate, was asked to manage a company in Bucharest run by a
Panamanian national, the private news agency Mediafax reported. The
company's name and business were not disclosed.
	   In his six years as manager, Nadejde illegally diverted
$230,000, the court decided.
	   The Securitate of former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was very
active in foreign trade. Ceausescu was overthrown and executed in
Dec. 1989.
	   Nadejde's trial, considered sensitive, was held behind closed
doors at Bucharest's military court.

Bob Dole visits Bosnia to review progress on missing persons issue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole of
Kansas arrived Saturday to review progress on the missing persons
issue in Bosnia.
	   During his one-day visit to the Bosnian capital, Dole, a
chairman of the International Commission on Missing Persons, will
meet with Bosnian leaders, representatives of the international
community and members of the Muslim, Serb and Croat commissions for
missing persons.
	   Bad roads and wintry weather forced a cancellation of plans for
him to visit forensic facilities in Tuzla and Banja Luka, where
much of the work of trying identify exhumed persons killed in the
Bosnian war is being conducted.
	   Between 1992 and 1995, about 200,000 people were killed. An
additional 20,000 went missing and are feared dead.
	   Exhumations have been conducted by all three sides _ Muslims,
Serbs and Croats_ since 1995 in an effort to track down the fate of
the missing.
	   According to the press release issued by the ICMP, in 1996 and
1997 a total of 500 remains were exhumed. This year, through the
joint efforts of the local commissions and the international
community, almost 1,700 remains have been found.

Drunken passenger dies after being tied to airline seat.

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A Hungarian Airlines passenger died
Saturday after the crew tied him to his seat to stop his abuse of
other passengers and crew members, the state news agency MTI
reported.
	   The Finnish national, who was not identified, was confined while
the plane was en route to Budapest from Bangkok. The captain
decided to make an emergency landing in Istambul, Turkey, but the
man died before the plane touched down, said MTI.
	   The cause of death and circumstances of the incident are being
investigated by Turkish police and the crew, MTI said. The captain
ordered the passenger bound after he allegedly became intoxicated
and started harassing others in the aircraft.

Croats disappointed at international reluctance to give aid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EUGENE BRCIC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ An international donors' conference meant
to bankroll Croatian reconstruction ended Saturday with commitments
of only about dlrs 25 million _ approximately 10 percent of the
target.
	   Foreign Minister Mate Granic expressed regret that there was not
``more significant support from the international community.''
	   Almost 50 countries and 27 organizations took part in the
two-day event meant to finance reconstruction of war-damaged
regions and revive the stagnating economy.
	   The pledges fell far short of the estimated dlrs 2.5 billion
needed to cover the fundamental costs of reconstruction.
	   Some of the reluctance appeared tied to the perception that
Croatia continues to discriminate against its ethnic Serb minority.
	   Croatia's Serbs rebelled and took control of a third of the
country in 1991, but were defeated by the Croatian army in 1995.
Hundreds of thousands of civilians were left homeless, and more
than 170,000 dwellings were destroyed, along with other property.
	   The United States and the World Bank are Croatia's most
important aid sources. Between them, they account for up to dlrs
350 million a year in donations and loans.

Unruly passenger dies on Hungarian airliner after injection

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ An unruly passenger died aboard a Malev
Hungarian airliner on Saturday after being strapped to his seat and
injected with tranquilizers.
	   The passenger, identified by Turkey's Anatolia news agency as
Finnish national Mikaeinar Peterson, was dead by the time the jet
made an emergency landing in Istanbul.
	   Anatolia and Hungary's MTI news agency said the man started
harassing others aboard a flight from Bangkok to Budapest. He
allegedly punched a pilot and tried to choke an attendant.
	   The crew and passengers tied him to his seat and a doctor aboard
gave him an injection.
	   An autopsy done later in the day showed he died because of the
mixture of the tranquilizer and some other drug or alcohol.
Witnesses saw the man take a pill before he became violent and
authorities suspected he was drunk, Anatolia said.
	   Police detained two pilots, four attendants and five passengers
along with the doctor and his father. A new crew from Hungary flew
the jet to Budapest with its remaining 183 passengers.

Milosevic's new target at home: best and brightest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ William Faulkner went first. Then
Thomas Pynchon and Edgar Allan Poe.
	   More volumes of American plays went into boxes as the professor
who taught them at Belgrade University had to pack and leave. He
was sacked in the ongoing government purge of unruly
intelligentsia.
	   With a heavy heart but ``without regret,'' Srdjan Vujica emptied
his office, as did more than two dozen other university teachers
fired or forced into early retirement in the past weeks by the
regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The purge that appears to have pushed Serbia yet another notch
deeper into totalitarianism began with a new university law,
enacted last summer while the world focused on ethnic warfare in
the Serbian Kosovo province.
	   Under the new law, the government vastly expanded its authority
over state-run universities in the country and appointed new deans
-- strict Milosevic loyalists.
	   The new appointees, in turn, demanded the teaching staff sign
new contracts confirming they accept new state-imposed terms.
	   ``It was a loyalty oath,'' Vujica says. ``I just couldn't do
that. The new law is intended as punishment, a way to purge
teachers who supported earlier protests'' against Milosevic.
	   Reaction so far has been a massive strike by some 20,000
students from Literature, Electronics and Law departments in the
Belgrade University, against what they see as a general crackdown
on the educated who form the core of opposition to Milosevic.
	   The pillar of Milosevic's 10-year rule have always been less
educated people, who form a vast majority in Yugoslavia, where
about a third of 10 million people are functionally illiterate.
	   ``The West has forced Milosevic to stop his forces against
(ethnic) Albanians in Kosovo, but we here can count only on
ourselves when we want to defy his autocracy. That's what we are
doing,'' said 23-year old law student, Katarina Jakovljevic.
	   The atmosphere at the university is similar to late 1996 when
students spearheaded months-long anti-Milosevic protests that
nearly toppled the government. Boycotting classes now, the students
gather to listen to fiery speeches by protest leaders. They are
getting increasing support from remaining professors who appear
suddenly emboldened by the students' resolve not to give in.
	   ``The regime wants to introduce full dictatorship,'' a student
leader, Boris Karajicic said. ``They are replacing eminent
professors with some mediocre, pro-government teachers. It's the
limitless desire for power that brings such laws.''
	   The protest may snowball into a much bigger and wider one, said
Karajicic, as the authorities show no sign of giving up the
crackdown.
	   The government has also brought a restrictive media law that
effectively shut down several independent papers and led to heavy
fines for several others whose articles were deemed anti-state
activity.
	   One of the papers was punished for running an ad by a student
group called Otpor (Resistance), urging all to a general resistance
to the government. An Otpor member was later jailed for 10 days for
spraying the group's symbol, a clenched fist, on a building in
downtown Belgrade.
	   ``What they did to free media means suppressing freedom. It's
the same with the university,'' English language major, Uros
Vasiljevic, said. ``Resisting that means dealing with the main
problem of this country, the nature of this regime.''
	   ``The intentions behind the new laws are purely political. Their
consequences can be devastating for science, for education for
everything,'' Vujica said, who like other sacked teachers is banned
from even entering university premises.
	   But, the crackdown could backlash, he said.
	   ``When only those without integrity and knowledge remain working
in state institutions, the whole system will collapse,'' he said.

KLA accuses Serbs of ambushes, seeks more withdrawals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo Albanian rebels accused Serb
forces Sunday of launching unprovoked attacks in the shooting
deaths of more than a dozen ethnic Albanians in the past few days.
	   They said more Serb forces must pull back in order to avoid more
violence in the tense standoff between the two sides, which have
clashed sporadically since an October peace agreement.
	   The killings have heightened fears full-scale combat may resume
soon in Kosovo after halting two months ago when Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a withdrawal of many of his forces
from the separatist Serbian province.
	   In a statement published in the ethnic Albanian newspaper Koha
Ditore, the Kosovo Liberation Army blamed the Serbs for the
escalation of violence, saying they had attacked both villages and
KLA positions despite the cease-fire.
	   The two deadliest recent shootings _ the killings of three
ethnic Albanians by unidentified assailants in Pristina and eight
KLA fighters by border guards on the Albanian border _ were Serb
ambushes, the rebels said.
	   They disputed the position of international officials that both
sides are to blame for the rising violence in Kosovo.
	   ``It is unacceptable for the international community to equate
the KLA with Serb forces'' and hold both responsible, the statement
said.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is coordinating an international monitoring mission in Kosovo,
condemned Kosovo violence last week but declined to single out
either side in the recent shootings.
	   Some 500 unarmed verifiers now patrol Kosovo daily _ a total
that is rising almost daily as the OSCE tries to put about 2,000 on
duty in the province.
	   Driving through tense villages in bright orange trucks, the
verifiers have brought a sense of added security for ethnic
Albanians even though they have no weapons.
	   ``Hopefully, the deployment of the OSCE verification mission
will create a new environment, a new atmosphere,'' ethnic Albanian
political Ibrahim Rugova said Friday.
	   About 700 French NATO troops were expected in neighboring
Macedonia on Sunday as part of a rapid-reaction force being
established there to evacuate the Kosovo monitors if needed. About
180 personnel were already on hand doing preparatory work for the
French-led backup force, which is to total about 1,500.
	   The KLA said in its statement Sunday that it has urged
international officials to push for Serb withdrawals from several
more positions. It also said the Serbs should stop patrolling some
roads for reasons of the population's security.
	   A precise deployment of allowed Serb deployments was not
specified in the October agreement brokered by U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
	   The embattled southern province in Serbia, which is the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia, has a population of 2 million which
consists mostly of ethnic Albanians.
	   Serbia used force this year to try to crush separatist rebels
and keep Kosovo from seceding. Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic
Albanian civilians, were killed and as many as 300,000 were
displaced from their homes.
	   Dozens have been killed since the October agreement. In the
latest violence, the ethnic Albanians' Council for the Defense of
Human Rights said a Serb sniper killed an Albanian in his field
Saturday in Klina, 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Pristina.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo Albanian rebels accused Serb

	   They said more Serb forces must pull back in order to avoid more
violence in the tense standoff between the two sides, which have
clashed sporadically since an October peace agreement.
	   To add muscle to that agreement, the advance party of a NATO
European military force arrived Sunday in neighboring Macedonia to
be on standby to rescue if necessary the international civilians
trying to verify compliance with the October accord.
	   The recent killings in Kosovo have heightened fears full-scale
combat may resume soon after halting two months ago when Yugoslav

	   ``Hopefully, the deployment of the OSCE verification mission
will create a new environment, a new atmosphere,'' ethnic Albanian
political Ibrahim Rugova said Friday.
	   In the Macedonian capital Skopje, four huge French Hercules
military planes with about 30 military officers and 40 tons of
equipment landed Sunday in driving wind and snow to set up the NATO
force to protect the civilian verifiers.
	   Over the next two weeks, the force will grow up to a 1,700-man
NATO mission, led by France. The force will include about 700
French, 350 British and 200 soldiers each from Italy, Germany and
the Netherlands.
	   If the Kosovo peace verifiers run into trouble, the NATO
soldiers will swiftly engage in a cross-border action from
Macedonia to extract them and bring to safety.
	   ``We are glad to be here, but I hope we have no job to do in
Kosovo,'' Lt. Col. Charles de Kersabiec told reporters.
	   In its statement Sunday, the KLA said it has urged international
officials to push for Serb withdrawals from several more positions.

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Several hundred opponents of President
Alexander Lukashenko gathered outside his official residence Sunday
to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Although police had ordered the rally moved to another square in
the center of the city, the demonstrators went ahead with the rally
at Oktyabryskaya Square, about 200 meters (yards) from Lukashenko's
residence. There were no arrests and no reports of violence.
	   Organizers of the rally complained, however, they they were
summoned to police headquarters before the rally.
	   ``The attitude of the authorities to this rally shows that in
this country there is no power of law, but the power of force. The
human rights of life, information and law are violated in
Belarus,'' said Youri Khadyka, deputy chairman of the Popular
Front, the main opposition organization.
	   In speeches at the rally, opposition leaders complained that
Lukashenko, an authoritarian president who would like to revive the
Soviet Union, has consistently violated human rights.
	   Oleg Belyavsky, the main organizer of the protest, charged that
500 people had been unjustly arrested or beaten by authorities this
year, and that thousands of people have been politically repressed
over the past four years of Lukashenko's rule.
	   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the
U.N. General Assembly on Dec. 10, 1948.

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Several hundred opponents of President
Alexander Lukashenko gathered near his official residence Sunday to
commemorate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Although police had ordered the rally moved to another square in
the center of the city, the demonstrators went ahead with the rally
at Oktyabryskaya Square, about 200 meters (yards) from Lukashenko's
residence.
	   Ten people were arrested by plainclothes officers, according to
officials with Charter '97, the human rights organization
sponsoring the rally. Police would not confirm the report.
	   Organizers of the rally complained that they were summoned to
police headquarters before the rally.
	   ``The attitude of the authorities to this rally shows that in
this country there is no power of law, but the power of force. The
human rights of life, information and law are violated in
Belarus,'' said Youri Khadyka, deputy chairman of the Popular
Front, the main opposition organization.
	   In speeches at the rally, opposition leaders complained that
Lukashenko, an authoritarian president who would like to revive the
Soviet Union, has consistently violated human rights.
	   Oleg Belyavsky, the main organizer of the protest, charged that
500 people had been unjustly arrested or beaten by authorities this
year, and that thousands of people have been politically repressed
over the past four years of Lukashenko's rule.
	   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the
U.N. General Assembly on Dec. 10, 1948.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ William Faulkner went first. Then
Thomas Pynchon and Edgar Allan Poe.
	   More volumes of American works went into boxes as Srdjan Vujica,
the professor who taught them at Belgrade University, had to pack
and leave after he was fired in a continuing government purge of
the intelligentsia.
	   With a heavy heart but ``without regret,'' Vujica emptied his
office, as did more than two dozen other university teachers fired
or forced into early retirement in recent weeks by the government
of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The purge began under a new law enacted quietly over the summer
that vastly expanded the government's authority over state-run
universities.
	   Milosevic loyalists were appointed deans, and they demanded the
teaching staff sign new contracts confirming that they accepted new
state-imposed rules.
	   ``It was a loyalty oath,'' Vujica said. ``I just couldn't do
that. The new law is intended as punishment, a way to purge
teachers who supported earlier protests'' against Milosevic.
	   Milosevic's 10-year rule has always drawn its support from the
less educated, a large majority in Yugoslavia, where about a third
of the nation's 10 million people are functionally illiterate.
	   About 20,000 students in Belgrade University's literature,
electronics and law schools are boycotting classes to protest the
teacher firings. But so far the anger hasn't produced the
large-scale street demonstrations that grew out of student protests
in late 1996.
	   ``The regime wants to introduce full dictatorship,'' said a
student leader, Boris Karajicic. ``They are replacing eminent
professors with some mediocre, pro-government teachers. It's the
limitless desire for power that brings such laws.''

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Washington may claim the
violence-plagued rule of Slobodan Milosevic is weakening, but the
Yugoslav president's supporters and even some critics at home say
he is as strong as ever.
	   Ignoring U.S. pressure on his government, he is purging the
police and military in apparent preparation for another major
crackdown: this time on pro-independence elements in Montenegro,
the small republic that with Serbia forms present-day Yugoslavia.
	   The purge prompted State Department spokesman James P. Rubin to
declare last Monday that ``President Milosevic's grip on power is
weakening.''
	   Rubin accused Milosevic of being ``at the center of every
crisis'' during and since the breakup of the old Yugoslav
federation. ``He is not simply part of the problem; Milosevic is
the problem,'' the spokesman added.
	   Washington has always blamed Milosevic for the ethnic conflicts
in the Balkans, and it imposed diplomatic and economic sanctions on
his government. But the Clinton administration has worked closely
with him since 1995 trying to ensure a lasting peace in Bosnia,
formerly a Yugoslav republic.
	   Rubin's remarks led to news media speculation that Washington
has concluded there can't be a secure peace with Milosevic in power
and now is encouraging his ouster.
	   Yet many of Milosevic's domestic allies and opponents alike
agree that the Yugoslav president's rule is as strong as ever and
that the recent sacking of his army chief, Gen. Momcilo Perisic,
and secret police head, Jovica Stanisic, herald more trouble for
the Balkans.
	   Both Stanisic and Perisic were replaced by officers loyal to
Milosevic's neo-communist wife, Mirjana Markovic. Her hard-line
loyalists have recently assumed most top posts in Yugoslavia,
further strengthening Milosevic.
	   Milosevic has also moved against independent news media _ the
only real source of information for most Yugoslavs _ by introducing
harsh press laws and banning and closing newspapers and radio
stations. He recently purged Belgrade University, the traditional
center of rebellion, by sacking professors and replacing them with
his supporters.
	   Despite the new crackdown _ and unhappiness over Yugoslavia's
deep economic problems _ there have been no street protests like
those two years ago when Milosevic's rule was seriously shaken by
three months of demonstrations. Those protests ended in a major
disappointment for his opponents when their leaders split up over
personal differences.
	   Military and police purges have been common for Milosevic ahead
of major actions against his opponents, and the latest ousters were
a clear sign of his strength rather than weakness, his opponents
say.
	   The purges ``seem to me like a reorganization of his ranks
before a new offensive against Montenegro,'' said Montenegro's
pro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic, a strong critic of
Milosevic.

KLA accuses Serbs of ambushes, seeks more withdrawals

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo Albanian rebels accused Serb
forces Sunday of launching unprovoked attacks in the shooting
deaths of more than a dozen ethnic Albanians over the past few
days.
	   They said more Serb forces must pull back in order to avoid new
violence between the two sides, which have clashed sporadically
since an October peace agreement.
	   To add muscle to that agreement, an advance team of NATO
military forces arrived Sunday in neighboring Macedonia _ to be on
standby if they are needed to rescue civilians trying to verify
compliance with the deal.
	   But the recent killings in Kosovo have heightened fears that
full-scale combat may resume after stopping two months ago when
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to withdraw many
forces from the separatist province.
	   In a statement published in the ethnic Albanian newspaper Koha
Ditore, the Kosovo Liberation Army blamed the Serbs for the
escalation of violence, including the recent killings of three
ethnic Albanians by unidentified assailants in Pristina and eight
KLA fighters by guards on the Albanian border.
	   In the Macedonian capital, Skopje, four French Hercules military
planes with about 30 military officers and 40 tons of equipment
landed Sunday in driving wind and snow to set up the NATO force to
protect the civilian verifiers.
	   Over the next two weeks, the force will grow to a 1,700-strong
mission led by France. The force will include about 700 French, 350
British and 200 soldiers each from Italy, Germany and the
Netherlands.
	   If the Kosovo peace verifiers run into trouble, the NATO
soldiers will move in to rescue them.
	   ``We are glad to be here, but I hope we have no job to do in
Kosovo,'' Lt. Col. Charles de Kersabiec told reporters.
	   The embattled province in southern Serbia, which is the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia, has a population of 2 million people,
mostly ethnic Albanians.
	   Serbia used force this year to try to crush separatist rebels.
Hundreds of people, mostly ethnic Albanian civilians, were killed
and as many as 300,000 were displaced.
	   In the latest violence, the ethnic Albanians' Council for the
Defense of Human Rights said a Serb sniper killed an Albanian
Saturday in Klina, 18 miles northwest of Pristina.
	   In the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, a delegation of Russian
lawmakers met Sunday with Serbian officials in a gesture of support
for the government. The delegation is headed by Sergei Glotov,
leader of the anti-NATO faction.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ For a Kosovo schoolteacher, faith in
ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and his pacifist policies
died the day Serb police burned down his house.
	   Today, Agim Cervadiku believes only in the power of guns to
wrench the province free of Serbia's stern rule. Holed up with
other guerrillas in a half-destroyed farmhouse in rural Kosovo, he
chuckles at the mention of a man he once revered.
	   ``He is an admirable person, but he is without results in nearly
10 years,'' says the 38-year-old Cervadiku, local president of
Rugova's party until the Serbs' crackdown on separatists engulfed
his village of Poklek last May.
	   ``With his politics only, Serbia will win.''
	   Admired in the West for an unswerving adherence to pacifism in
the Balkans cauldron of hatred, Rugova is praised by world leaders
and has twice been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. This month
he will be presented the Sakharov human rights prize in France from
the European Parliament.
	   But at home, the soft spoken political leader seems increasingly
adrift, virtually helpless to influence the cause of war or peace
in a province where ethnic Albanians make up most of the population
of 2 million.
	   While many still support him, Kosovo newspaper cartoons now
lampoon Rugova as an intellectual wearing his trademark silk neck
scarf and a frightened look.
	   The guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, no longer
outcasts, have assumed a bigger role in U.S.-led shuttle diplomacy
since an October truce and threaten to eclipse Rugova's influence
and once-soaring popularity among ethnic Albanians.
	   Nonetheless, Rugova, while relegated virtually to the sidelines,
is outwardly unshaken in the belief his policies are correct. He
says a majority of Kosovo Albanians still side with him.
	   After stubbornly refusing to acknowledge the KLA's existence
until last summer, he insisted in a rare interview last week that
the rebels are still only ``small groups of people, quite
isolated.''
	   Despite increased criticism, he told The Associated Press, ``I
remain a strong advocate of nonviolence and peaceful activism _
peaceful activism that has managed to create some institutions in
Kosovo and a civic society in spite of Serb domination.''
	   A president who has never held power, the 54-year-old Rugova may
be a more accomplished academic and author than a politician.
	   Born Dec. 2, 1944, in the western Kosovo village of Crnce, he
was raised by an uncle after his father was killed in World War II.
Neighbors recall him as a shy boy who never played soccer and was
always reading books.
	   After studying in Pristina and France and earning his Ph.D. in
literature, he worked as a magazine editor, critic and researcher
in Kosovo's capital, and has written 10 books of literary
criticism.
	   As Kosovo's long-simmering Serb-Albanian tensions were coming to
a boil a decade ago, Rugova burst into prominence by promising
something bold and unorthodox: independence through peaceful means.
	   His ideas won him election as head of the biggest Albanian
party, the pro-independence League of Democratic Kosovo, in 1989
when Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic revoked Kosovo's nearly
two decades of autonomy.
	   After Rugova's LDK proclaimed the self-styled Republic of
Kosovo, he was overwhelmingly elected its president in 1992 and
again last March. But Serbian authorities outlawed the new state.
	   Instead of ruling, Rugova poured his efforts into organizing an
unusual parallel state with separate schools, medical and civic
institutions.
	   It's an achievement he clings to in this dark year of bloodshed,
when hundreds have been killed and over a quarter-million displaced
in months of fighting that began when Serb forces launched an
offensive to try to crush the KLA.
	   ``We have proved that we are able to make it, to keep house, to
keep a society,'' Rugova says. ``This is to the credit of the
people of Kosovo.''
	   His role now has been reduced largely to that of a symbol who
speaks out about the ethnic Albanians' plight while rarely
venturing out of Pristina, the war-intact capital where support for
his pacifism remains high.
	   Critics call him a figurehead, propped up by international
officials who meet with him in lieu of other elected Albanian
leaders.
	   ``As a politician he is incompetent,'' snorts Adem Demaci, a
respected former dissident who says he speaks for the KLA.
	   Despite the defections and lost support, there is little doubt
Rugova would be re-elected if a political settlement is reached and
new elections are held next year. No other charismatic leader has
emerged, and Rugova's warm reception by world leaders stands him in
good stead _ if the fighting can be stopped.
	   ``Rugova has achieved strong ties with America and the West, and
ethnic Albanians know international assistance represents our best
hope for the future,'' says Gjergj Dedaj, vice chairman of Kosovo
Albanians' parliament.
	   ``There is no good alternative'' to Rugova, he adds.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ An 11-year-old girl gave birth to a
baby girl and the 17-year-old father could face up to 10 years in
prison for sex with a minor, the state-run news agency MTI
reported.
	   The girl, who has not been identified, lives with her family in
Boldogkoeujfalu, a small village in the romantic Zemplen mountains,
160 kilometers (100 miles) northeast of Budapest.
	   She has three siblings, the youngest of whom is three years of
age.
	   She was taken to the county hospital in Miskolc last week and
doctors, fearing complications, induced labor Thursday and
delivered the baby on Friday by Caesarean section. The baby weighed
2.5 kilograms (5.5 lbs).
	   Both mother and baby have been reported in good condition.
	   Hungarian law forbides sexual relations with a girl of 12 years
or younger. It carries a sentence of 5-10 years imprisonment.
	   The father, who was also not identified, has yet to be charged,
MTI reported.

Kosovo Albanian negotiator: U.S. plan totally unacceptable
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. peace efforts in Kosovo
suffered a setback on Monday, with the chief ethnic Albanian
negotiator reportedly rejecting a draft for the future of the
majority ethnic Albanian province of Serbia.
	   Fehmi Agani, head of the Kosovo Albanian negotiating team, said
the latest version of the American peace plan was ``totally
unacceptable,'' Glas, a Belgrade-based daily, reported.
	   Agani did not elaborate why the plan, presented by American
envoy Christopher Hill, was unacceptable for his side. Ethnic
Albanian negotiators were expected to come up with an official
reaction later Monday.
	   Details of the newest version of the plan have not been made
public. The American diplomat has been trying to hammer out a peace
formula acceptable to both independence-minded ethnic Albanians and
the Serb government, which wants to keep control over the province.
	   But Hill's efforts so far have been fruitless with the two sides
unable to agree on a compromise formula. Although a de-facto cease
fire generated by an agreement to end a government crackdown in
Kosovo has reduced bloodshed, there are fears that Kosovo will
again explode in fierce fighting unless a political solution is
found by spring.
	   Clashes earlier this year pitting an alliance of Yugoslav army
and Serb police forces against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army claimed hundreds of lives and made more than a
quarter of a million people homeless. Serbia is the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   A previous version of the U.S. draft was rejected by Serbia
because it gave the republic almost no control over Kosovo. But
that formula was cautiously greeted by ethnic Albanian negotiators
and the guerrillas gave a mixed response, with one faction not
ruling it out as an interim solution, and the other rejecting it.
	   ``We had some objections to the previous version too, but this
one is totally unacceptable,'' Agani told Glas. ``It is obvious
that Hill offers one solution after talking to us and another after
talking to (Serbian president Milan) Milutinovic.''
	   It was not clear what changes were made to the previous draft,
but Agani's criticism suggested the reworked version gave Serbia
more authority in Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who make up more than 90 percent of Kosovo's
population, overwhelmingly seek independence from Serbia.

Top Bosnian Serb in custody pleads innocent to genocide charges

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The top Bosnian Serb war crimes
suspect in U.N. custody _ a general accused of overseeing the 1995
massacre of thousands of Muslims _ pleaded innocent Monday to
genocide charges.
	   At his arraignment before the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, Gen.
Radislav Krstic also pleaded innocent to crimes against humanity
and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions.
	   Krstic, arrested last week by U.S. members of the NATO
peacekeeping force in Bosnia, is the most senior Serb military
officer to be tried for atrocities during the Bosnian war.
	   A trial date was not immediately set Monday for Krstic, who is
being held in the U.N. court's high-security cell block outside The
Hague. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment.
	   Krstic, wearing a green suit, white shirt and tie, was allowed
to remain seated as he entered his pleas. His lawyer, Nenad
Petrusic, told presiding Judge Claude Jorda of France that Krstic
was suffering from serious injuries which made it difficult for him
to stand up. Krstic reportedly lost part of his right leg after
stepping on a mine in 1994.
	   The 50-year-old general leaned forward and listened carefully as
his indictment was read. It alleges the offenses occurred following
the Serb takeover of the U.N. ``safe haven'' of Srebrenica in
eastern Bosnia in July 1995.
	   According to the indictment, forces under Krstic and Bosnian
Serb wartime military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic ``either expelled or
killed'' most members of the enclave's Bosnian Muslim population,
using automatic weapons, hand grenades and other weaponry.
	   Krstic planned and assisted in the ``preparation or execution of
a planned and organized mass execution of thousands of captured
Bosnian Muslim men,'' reads the indictment, which was issued in
October and made public only last week. It had been kept secret so
he wouldn't be prompted to flee.
	   The killings, described in the indictment as ``wide-scale and
organized,'' allegedly occurred in several locations in and around
the enclave, including a warehouse and schools.
	   Soldiers under Krstic's command used heavy equipment to bury the
victims in mass graves. When the international community learned of
the killings, Krstic and his units dug up the bodies and
transferred them to other graves, the indictment alleges.
	   Krstic is believed to be a close associate of Mladic and former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, the tribunal's top two
suspects. Both have been indicted for the massacres at Srebrenica;
both remain at large.
	   The tribunal was established in 1993 by the U.N. Security
Council to prosecute genocide and war crimes stemming from the
armed clashes in the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.

Ukrainian child dies in fire caused by faulty heater

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A house fire in a Ukrainian village killed
a 6-year-old girl and left three other children hospitalized, the
Emergency Situations Ministry reported Monday.
	   Sunday's fire in Iverska, a village in the eastern Donetsk
region, was caused by a faulty homemade heater, the ministry said.
	   Unusually cold winter weather hit Ukraine early this year,
prompting some residents to use homemade heating devices to warm
their houses because of often erratic energy supplies.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The top Bosnian Serb war crimes
suspect in U.N. custody _ a general accused of overseeing the 1995
massacre of thousands of Muslims _ pleaded innocent Monday to
genocide charges.
	   At his arraignment before the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, Gen.
Radislav Krstic also pleaded innocent to crimes against humanity
and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions.
	   ``I plead not guilty,'' Krstic, 50, said calmly and clearly as
each charge was read out.
	   Krstic, arrested last week by U.S. members of the NATO
peacekeeping force in Bosnia, is the most senior Serb military
officer to be tried for atrocities during the Bosnian war.
	   A trial date was not immediately set Monday for Krstic, who is

was suffering from serious injuries which made it difficult for him
to stand up. Krstic lost part of his right leg, reportedly after
stepping on a mine in 1994.
	   Petrusic described Krstic's health as ``truly, seriously
imperiled,'' and said there was a chance of gangrene where the limb
was amputated.
	   Asked by Jorda how he felt, Krstic said: ``As well as can be
expected on the whole, but I am tired after the arrest.
Exhausted.'' Krstic also complained that there was no heating in
his U.N. cell and that he was receiving no therapy for his injured
leg.
	   His indictment accuses him of involvement in atrocities that
occurred following the Serb takeover of the U.N. ``safe haven'' of
Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia in July 1995. Prosecutor Brenda Hollis
said she would likely call between 50 and 70 witnesses at the
trial, which is expected to last for months.
	   According to the indictment, forces under Krstic and Bosnian
Serb wartime military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic ``either expelled or
killed'' most members of the enclave's Bosnian Muslim population,
using automatic weapons, hand grenades and other weaponry.

Ex-communists seeks amnesty for guards, others convicted in unified
</HEADLINE>
Germany &QL; 
 &UR; By THOMAS SCHMOLL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's main governing and opposition parties
united Monday against calls by ex-communists to grant amnesty to
former East German officials convicted of such crimes as killing
citizens as they tried to flee the communist state.
	   Such an amnesty would demonstrate disrespect for former East
German activists whose peaceful demonstrations led to the fall of
the Berlin Wall in 1989, Volker Beck, a Greens legal expert, was
quoted Monday as saying in the Berliner Morgenpost.
	   As part of a proposed amnesty law, an ex-communist Party of
Democratic Socialism lawmaker, Evelyn Kenzler, has called for
compensation payments of 600 marks (dlrs 350) for every month that
former East German soldiers, border guards and officials serve in
German jails.
	   The party has long argued against trying officials and the
rank-and-file for enforcing what was then East German law,
including the shoot-to-kill orders on the border. The federal
Constitutional Court, Germany's nation's highest, ruled in 1996
that the trials legal because Wall shootings violated human rights.
	   To date, some 80 trials of border guards and former leaders have
produced hundreds of convictions on charges relating to shootings
at the border with West Germany. Authorities say up to 1,000 East
Germans died trying to flee to the West during the nearly 30 years
of the Wall.
	   PDS parliamentary leader, Gregor Gysi, on Monday said amnesty
would help foster reconciliation between eastern and western
Germany, but that it should only apply to those who were acting
under orders.
	   ``A soldier who shot at someone trying to flee who had already
surrendered would also have been guilty under East German law,''
Gysi said in a telephone interview.
	   Such a law, however, appeared unlikely to get anywhere, with
both governing parties, the Social Democrats and the Greens, as
well as the opposition Christian Democrats and the Free Democrats
swiftly denouncing the idea.
	   The Social Democrats said the proposal showed a ``contempt for
basic law.''
	   The proposal only hardened suspicions by some that the party has
not fully embraced democracy. ``The PDS is and remains a wolf in
sheep's clothing,'' said Free Democratic vice chairwoman Cornelia
Pieper.

Slovakia looking for sign of encouragement from Vienna summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Slovakia expects a clear sign of a
support from the upcoming European summit in Vienna for being among
the first candidates for EU membership, government officials said
Monday.
	   Slovakia was criticized and excluded from group of first
candidates under rule of former Prime Minister Vladmir Meciar. But
new government of Mikulas Dzurinda believes Slovakia has taken
measures to bring democracy into the country again.
	   ``Policy wait and see is not appropriate because some concrete
measures have already been taken in Slovakia. The Vienna summit
should implement these in the end at least in a positive mention of
developments in Slovakia,'' Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan told
reporters.
	   Officials also said they are looking to Austria, Germany and
others for support in bringing renewed interest in Slovak
membership.
	   ``We rely mostly on Austria and Germany but we also have good
relations with France and other members of the EU,'' said Vice
Premier Pavol Hamzic.
	   The prime minister said that more than 70 percent of Slovakia's
people support membership of the EU and more than half want to join
NATO.
	   Slovak officials have declared that membership in the EU and
NATO is the country's priority.

Tajima trounces Chinese rivals

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japanese swimmer Yasuko Tajima trounced
China's world record holders Chen Yan and Wu Yanyan to claim the
women's 400-meter medley gold medal at the Asian Games Monday.
	   China won the opening two swim golds and was expected to take
the third with event record holder Chen and 200-meter medley record
holder Wu in the field.
	   But Tajima, third behind Chen in the event at this year's world
championships, finished in 4 minutes, 39.92 seconds, well ahead of
Wu (4:46.74) and Chen (4:47.34).
	   Her victory, and a triumph by men's 200-meter freestyle swimmer
Yosuke Ichikawa, gave Japan two golds to China's three after the
latter claimed the women's 4x200-meter freestyle victory.
	   Chen set the world record at 4:34.79 last year and backed it up
by winning the world title in Perth in January.
	   She got a poor start in the butterfly Monday and was fourth
after 100 meters but headed into the final 100 meters of freestyle
in second. But Tajima, 17, increased her margin from four seconds
as Chen struggled down the stretch, unable to stop Wu from taking
silver.
	   Dual world championship medalist Shan Ying gave China a good
start to the battle for 32 golds when she powered to victory in the
100-meter freestyle in an outside lane.
	   Shan, who claimed bronze medals in the 50- and 100-meter double
at the Perth world meet earlier this year, was second-slowest
qualifier for the final and had to win from Lane 1.
	   She turned in front at 50 meters and finished in 56.20 seconds.
China's Chao Na and Japan's Sumika Minamoto, the fastest qualifier,
had a dead heat for silver in 56.39 seconds.
	   ``My mental and physical state is very good,'' Shan said. ``I
believed I would win.''
	   China is returning to the Asian Games four years after a drugs
scandal in Hiroshima, Japan. China won a remarkable 25 golds to
Japan's five in 1994 but seven of its swim team and 11 athletes
overall were found later to have used steroids. China also
dominated its home games in Beijing in 1990 with 20 golds.
	   After six team members were sent home in disgrace from the Perth
meet, China has claimed its team is free of drugs for this event.
All swimmers were tested before leaving for Bangkok. Medley swimmer
Xiong Guoming is back after he was one of the seven who returned a
positive test in Hiroshima.
	   Shan said the team was not affected by the drugs scandals.
	   ``We have no pressure on us here,'' Shan said. ``All of our
members are drug-free. Our government conducted very strict tests
on us before we left.''
	   China was on an early path to another Asian Games triumph as
Zeng Qiliang followed Shan's win with victory in the men's
100-meter breaststroke.
	   Zeng, who won the silver medal at the Perth world championships
behind Olympic champion Frederick Deburghgraeve of Belgium,
outclassed his rivals Monday. He finished in 1 minute, 2.32 seconds
for a comfortable win over Japan's Akira Hayashi (1:02.55) and
Malaysia's Elvin Chia (1:03.09).
	   A capacity crowd watched the opening swim session, with
organizers asking parents to put their children on their laps so
more could cram in.
	   They made most noise in the men's 200-meter freestyle when
Ichikawa (1:52.46) edged local hope Torlap Sethsothorn (1:52.53)
after the Thai seemed set to claim the gold.
	   The pool has been the subject of controversy over a bug
infestation and organizers have been treating the water. The air
was thick with bugs Monday but breaststroker Chia said it was more
of a problem in the warm-up pool.
	   ``There's a lot of bugs under the water there but it's not so
bad in the main pool,'' Chia said.
	   There were plenty of bugs outside the pool. A ramshackle strip
of bars across the street from the new pool blared loud music late
in the meet and it almost overpowered the final Chinese anthem.
	   Elsewhere the organization was a shambles. A mixed zone for
journalists to meet swimmers was the size and style of a prison
cell, and swimmers were not brought in for media conferences.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian police exhibited
confiscated weapons to CIA officials on Monday in an effort to
prove that they are meeting their security commitments.
	   The exhibit came a day after the deadline for Palestinians to
register their weapons expired and police started confiscations.
	   Fifty AK-47 rifles and five hand guns were on display for the
visiting CIA officers and the media.
	   A crackdown on illegal arms _ which are rife in the Palestinian
lands _ is one of the security pledges made by the Palestinians as
part of the U.S.-brokered Wye River accord signed in October.
	   In addition to collecting unlicensed guns, the Palestinians have
promised to introduce legislation on importing, manufacturing,
selling and possessing weapons.
	   The provision to include the CIA in the process was a concession
to Israel, and raised concerns in the United States that the spy
agency could be associated with any breakdown in the accord.
	   Police Chief Ghazi Jabali told reporters his troops were
cooperating with the CIA on security issues, including President
Bill Clinton's visit to the region starting Saturday.

in Macedonia on Monday, the first contingent of troops for a NATO
force to protect international civilians seeking to maintain the
cease-fire in neighboring Kosovo.
	   The soldiers landed at Petrovec airport together with a total of
12 cargo planes carrying communication, sanitary and other logistic
equipment for the NATO back-up force for Kosovo based in Macedonia.
	   Major Jeon de Schatus said other French soldiers, as well as
troops Britain, Germany Italy and Netherlands will arrive in the
next 10 days. Thirty French officers in charge of logistics and
some 30 tons of equipment arrived over the weekend to setup the
operation.
	   The force will grow up to a 1,700-man NATO mission, led by
France. The troops will include about 700 French, 350 British and
200 soldiers each from Italy, Germany and the Netherlands.
	   They will serve as a back-up security for up to 2,000 civilian
peace officials verifying a truce in Serbia's Kosovo province,
where ethnic Albanian separatists fought bitterly against Serbian
government forces.
	   If the Kosovo peace verifiers run into trouble, the NATO
soldiers will swiftly engage in a cross-border action from
Macedonia to extract them and bring to safety.
	   Macedonia has agreed to host the NATO force.
	   On Monday, Macedonia's premier Ljupco Georgievski said the move
brought Macedonia a step closer to joining NATO.

Greenpeace activists chain themselves to Japanese whaling ships
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) _ Four Greenpeace activists chained
themselves to two Japanese whaling ships Monday to prevent their
departure from port in New Caledonia.
	   A pair of protesters chained themselves to the harpoon and
anchor of the catcher vessel Kyo Maru while two others attached
themselves to the factory vessel Nisshin Maru.
	   Defending its members' actions, Greenpeace said that the
Japanese scientific whaling program was a sham and an insult to
science.
	   The Nisshin Maru, the mother ship, was undergoing repairs at
Noumea for engine trouble suffered when the ship caught fire last
month.
	   The fleet was due to return to Japan on Monday for further
repairs before resuming whaling in Antarctic waters in early 1999.
	   Greenpeace said the protesters would remain chained to the
vessels until there was a clear message from Japan that they would
not go whaling this season.
	   The environmental organization said Japan had consistently
ignored the internationally recognized Southern Ocean Whale
Sanctuary declared in 1994 by the International Whaling Commission.
	   The environmental group also described Japan's whaling campaign
as ``commercial whaling draped in the cloak of science.''
	   The Japanese whaling ships, which left Japan on Nov. 6, hope to
catch 440 minke whales this hunting season around Antarctica, the
same number caught last year.
	   Commercial whaling on the high seas has been banned since 1986.
But a small fleet of Japanese ships continues to kill whales and
dolphins along the nation's coasts, and hundreds of whales are
hunted on the open sea each year in what the government calls a
research program.
	   Japan's whaling program has often been criticized because meat
from the whales killed for research is sold on the open market,
with proceeds going to the whaling industry.

In Israel, less-than-enthusiastic welcome shaping up for Clinton

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, reflecting
growing Israeli unease over U.S. President Bill Clinton's upcoming
visit, suggested Monday that the trip was entirely at the
initiative of the American leader.
	   ``What am I going to tell him, not to come _ don't come? I can
prevent him from coming?'' Netanyahu asked rhetorically in an
interview on army radio. ``We're not accustomed to refusing someone
who wants to come.''
	   In another sign of tensions arising from the trip, the speaker
of Israel's parliament, Dan Tichon, said he intended to boycott
Clinton-connected events to protest the fact that the president did
not plan to address the Knesset.
	   Clinton's visit to Israel, which begins Saturday, is to be
coupled with a stop in the Gaza Strip, the first by a sitting U.S.
president.
	   The United States has repeatedly said the trip is not intended
as an endorsement of Palestinian statehood aspirations, but the
Palestinians see it as a powerful boost to their sovereignty hopes.
	   On Monday, speaking to reporters in Gaza, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat hailed the upcoming trip as ``historical and great.''
	   The presidential visit to Israel and the Palestinian lands is
meant to encourage both sides to stick to the timetable set out in
the Wye River accords signed in October.
	   Netanyahu said Clinton's trip ``has value only if he strengthens
the Palestinian fulfillment of their obligations'' under the
agreement.
	   He continued to deny U.S. administration claims that he had
initiated Clinton's _ but insisted that Clinton would nonetheless
be received warmly
	   In recent weeks, Israel and the Palestinians have accused one
another of failing to live up to various provisions, and Israel has
threatened to hold off on a scheduled Dec. 18 troop pullback.
	   Palestinians, for their part, are angry over stepped-up Jewish
settlement activity in the West Bank and Israel's failure to free
hundreds of so-called security prisoners, jailed for anti-Israel
activity.
	   Israel released the first 250 of a promised 750 Palestinian
prisoners last month, but they were mainly criminals, not security
prisoners as the Palestinians have demanded.
	   In response, Palestinians have been staging protests that have
repeatedly boiled over into violent street clashes.
	   More clashes with between protesters and Israeli and Palestinian
troops took place Monday in several West Bank towns.
	   Also, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners were continuing a hunger
strike begun over the weekend. A prisoners' association said the
hunger strike now included all 3,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails,
although the Israeli Prisons Service said it knew of only 514
taking part.
	   The controversy over Clinton's visit also comes as Netanyahu is
trying to quell a potential parliamentary rebellion. Opposition
from within the coalition to Israel's ceding of West Bank land has
forced Netanyahu to seek new allies to prop up his government.
	   A vote on early elections was possible later Monday, but the
prime minister's opponents may not push the issue forward if they
lack the votes.
	   Netanyahu has been sparring publicly with his former foreign
minister, David Levy, who considered rejoining the shaky governing
coalition in exchange for the finance minister's job.
	   The prime minister said the two couldn't agree on economic
principles and that he wouldn't sacrifice Israel's economy to
coalition politics.
	   Levy's spokesman said he would not renew negotiations with
Netanyahu and would support early elections. ``It's final,'' Alon
Amron said.
	   The Clinton visit has added to already-simmering tensions within
the government. At Sunday's Israeli Cabinet meeting, a shouting
match broke out over it, according to Israel radio.
	   ``Who invited President Clinton to the Gaza Strip?'' Silvan
Shalom, the science minister, reportedly yelled at Netanyahu.
Netanyahu said it had been Clinton's idea, not his.
	   In Gaza, Clinton is to be on hand for a meeting at which
Palestinians will reaffirm the nullifaction of clauses in their
national charter calling for Israel's destruction.

Japan's defense chief admits officers involved in cover-up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHIGEYOSHI KIMURA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Defense Agency head said Monday that
uniformed officers in the military helped hide documents sought by
prosecutors which implicated the agency in a procurement scandal.
	   Allegations of sweetheart deals involving military equipment
procurement have already resulted in several arrests and have cost
the jobs of one Defense Agency head and the chairman of a leading
electronics firm.
	   Defense Agency Director General Hosei Norota revealed the
complicity of uniformed officers in the scandal in response to a
question from a lawmaker during testimony before the lower house of
Parliament's budget committee.
	   ``We have found that some documents have been transferred out of
the office'' by officers from the air, ground and maritime defense
forces shortly before prosecutors raided the agency's headquarters
on Sept. 3, Norota said.
	   The Defense Agency's top bureaucrat, administrative
vice-minister Seiji Ema confirmed Norota's remarks, saying
``several uniformed officials transferred documents out of their
offices to military bases outside of the headquarters.''
	   The officers explained they would not be able to carry out their
regular office duties if prosecutors had seized the materials, Ema
said.
	   The scandal broke in September when prosecutors signaled their
readiness to indict officials suspected of conspiring to allow a
defense equipment supplier affiliated with NEC Corp. to keep
profits made by overcharging the government. The company was
allegedly allowed to keep the money in exchange for giving jobs to
retiring Defense Agency employees.
	   Since then, two Defense Agency officials have been indicted, as
have a dozen employees and former employees from NEC Corp. and two
subsidiaries.
	   Last month, Defense Agency chief Norota's predecessor, Fukushiro
Nukaga, resigned to take responsibility for the agency's role in
the scandal. Three high-ranking officials who were questioned by
prosecutors also resigned.
	   In October, NEC Chairman Tadahiro Sekimoto stepped down because
of the trouble the company's involvement had caused its customers,
employees and shareholders.
	   Prosecutors say the amount that the NEC affiliates overcharged
the Defense Agency totals nearly 1.7 billion yen (dlrs 13.9
million).
	   Japan's Defense Agency has also been tainted by a separate
scandal involving allegations the chairman of Fuji Heavy Industries
bribed a ruling party legislator for help in obtaining a defense
contract.
	   Fuji Heavy Chairman Isamu Kawai, 70, was arrested by prosecutors
last week.

Donors seeking anti-corruption guarantees for aid funding

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ International donors meeting this week in
Kampala are seeking guarantees of accountability from the
government before they will consider Uganda's request for an
additional dlrs 980 million in programs financing, officials said
Monday.
	   The conference of representatives of more than 20 countries and
several lending agencies which begins in the capital Wednesday,
follows a confidential World Bank report published last week that
exposed high level graft of public and donor funds.
	   Details of the report were published in the government-owned New
Vision newspaper.
	   ``Lack of accountability and transparency affects the provision
of services, especially for the poor,'' said Saskia de Lang, a
senior official at the Netherlands embassy in Kampala.
	   ``A more serious commitment of the government in this area is
considered by the donors as a necessary precondition,'' said de
Lang, speaking at a meeting of dozens of senior government
officials and donor representatives in advance of the conference.
	   The Uganda government has determined it needs dlrs 2,176 million
to finance social and economic programs over the next three years,
according to treasury secretary Emmanuel Mutebire.
	   Of that, donors have already pleged dlrs 1,190 million, and the
government is seeking added funding for the remaining dlrs 980
million, Mutebire said.
	   On Monday, the government presented donors with a request for
dlrs 57 millon for the 1998-99 financial year for the Poverty
Action Fund, a grants project for improving health and educational
facilities in rural areas.
	   The donors demanded the government provide quarterly expenditure
reports, the employment of independent auditors, published reports
on all grants, and closer involvement of district representatives
in quarterly donor meetings for the project since the local
officials are responsible for the funds.
	   Mutebire, who represented the government at Monday's meeting,
assured the donors that Uganda was committed to fighting
corruption.
	   ``Accountability will be ensured and the release of the Poverty
Action Funds will be displayed,'' Mutebire said. ``I want to assure
the donors here that we shall make sure that the value for money
shall be adhered to.''
	   President Yoweri Museveni is expected to address the four-day
conference, known as the Consultative Group, when it officially
opens on Wednesday.

 &UR; Pro-Kurdish party leader begins hunger strike in prison

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The imprisoned leader of a pro-Kurdish
party and four other party officials began a hunger strike Monday
protesting a police crackdown on their party.
	   Murat Bozlak and four other senior leaders of the Peoples'
Democracy Party, HADEP, are refusing food at an Ankara prison to
denounce a series of raids on party buildings nationwide over the
past weeks, the party said in a statement.
	   The raids resulted in thousands of arrests.
	   While many of the party members were subsequently released,
Bozlak and some 100 others face charges of separatist propaganda.
	   Police have been particularly tough on the party since the
detention in Rome last month of rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah
Ocalan, in a clear sign that authorities would not tolerate any
show of support for the rebels.
	   Most of those who were rounded up were protesting Turkish
demands for his extradition.
	   Ocalan's group has been fighting for autonomy in the southeast
since 1984 in a war that has claimed 37,000 lives.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The head of the Bank of Japan said Monday that
``Japan's economy remains in an extremely severe state.''
	   In testimony before Parliament, central bank governor Masaru
Hayami noted that corporate earnings have slipped and industrial
production has fallen.
	   The dire assessment follows a report last week that Japan's
economy shrank at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the latest
quarter, marking a full year of decline.
	   The slump in Asia's biggest economy has prolonged and deepened
the economic crisis plaguing neighboring countries from Indonesia
to South Korea.
	   The government has approved limited tax cuts and massive
spending on public works projects to boost economic growth, but so
far the efforts have failed to pull Japan out of its worst
recession since World War II.

Italian president fields questions from Australian students
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, a former magistrate, held court Monday in Australia for
students of Italian, fielding questions on leadership,
asylum-seekers _ and the corruption of his native tongue.
	   On the second day of an official visit to Australia, the first
time an Italian head of state has visited in a decade, Scalfaro
spent more than an hour addressing Italian language students and
their teachers.
	   Unwinding in the informal atmosphere of a University of
Melbourne lecture hall, he took time out from a busy schedule to
answer questions about what makes a good leader, Italy's future in
a united Europe and the creep of English words and phrases into the
language.
	   Italian professors at the talk said later they were impressed
with Scalfaro's open and relaxed attitude, saying he was
surprisingly outspoken on issues such as opening borders to
refugees.
	   The 80-year-old president, who leaves Tuesday for Canberra on
the second stage of his weeklong visit, also attended an Italian
Chamber of Commerce and Industry gathering, and an official state
reception hosted by Victoria state Premier Jeff Kennett.
	   The reception was attended by an enthusiastic crowd of about 300
Italian community and business leaders, including Bruno Grollo,
whose plans for the world's tallest tower received the green light
from the government Monday.
	   In another boost to the morale of the Italian community, Kennett
used the occasion to announce a change of name for a square on
Melbourne's Lygon Street Italian precinct, from Argyle Square to

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. Marine forces have been conducting land
and sea maneuvers for the past week and a half in Israel's Negev
desert, a spokesman said Monday.
	   U.S. embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz said that the training
exercises were routine under U.S.-Israel security agreements,
adding that Israel was one of the few countries in the region that
allowed U.S. Marines to train on its soil.
	   Schwartz said that the Marines were conducting the exercises
alone and that the fleet would return to sea before U.S. President
Bill Clinton's visit to the region Saturday.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Kuwait's deadly striking duo _ Jasem
al-Huwaidi and Farj Laheeb _ stayed at the top of the Asian Games
goal chart Monday as their team crushed Gulf rival United Arab
Emirates 5-0 in a second-round opener.
	   Al-Huwaidi scored three second-half goals against the
overwhelmed Emirates for his second hat trick of the games and
regained his place as the top goal scorer with a total of eight.
	   Laheeb, who fired Kuwait's second goal 30 minutes after
midfielder Hani al-Saqer opened the scoring in the 6th minute,
ended the day with a tournament total of seven.
	   The Kuwaiti goal feast ended a brief tie for the competition's
top scorer between Laheeb and South Korea's Choi Wong-soo, who
scored both of his team's goals in a shutout of Japan earlier
Monday.
	   Kuwait coach Milan Macala warned, however, that his team made
``dangerous, stupid mistakes'' and drew four yellow cards.
	   ``The next match we play is the Japanese,'' Macala said. ``I
cannot predict the result. Although our team members are physically
larger, the Japanese may be quicker.''
	   Tiny oil-rich Kuwait increasingly looks like one of the top
favorites of the games, having drubbed Mongolia 11-0 and drawn
against a determined Uzbekistan side, 3-3, in the first round.
	   Al-Huwaidi scored in the 23rd, 37th and 40th minutes and seems
poised to break his nine goal top-scoring mark from the Gulf Cup.
	   Macala said his players had had little time to relax following
last week's preliminary rounds, when the original 23 teams were cut
to 16, and complained of poor field conditions.
	   ``In some places, the condition is so bad that the players loose
ball contact,'' Macala said.

Rivalry explodes into open, but Le Pen tries to calm tempest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Rivalry within the far-right National Front almost
veered into a full-blown schism this weekend. But party leader
Jean-Marie Le Pen worked to contain the damage, and buck up his
increasingly contested authority.
	   In a measure of the bitter rivalry between Le Pen and Bruno
Megret, Le Pen accused the man long described as his top lieutenant
of being backed by ``extremists and racists.''
	   Le Pen and his anti-immigrant party are often accused of
extremism and racism.
	   The Le Pen-Megret rivalry exploded into a near schism at the
party's noisy National Council meeting on Saturday, when Le Pen
ejected two of Megret's backers.
	   Le Pen blamed the problems on ``a few people from an extremist
and even racist minority.''
	   If Megret ``thinks my position represents a sort of betrayal,''
Le Pen continued, ``I think he has no business in the movement I
preside over.''
	   The bitter words were then softened in a clear effort to heal
the divisions.
	   Megret, Le Pen said, ``will certainly be among the first 10'' on
the list for European Parliament elections in 1999.
	   He denigrated what some saw as an attempted putsch, calling it a
``pu-putsch.''
	   Le Pen plans to head the European elections list despite a
one-year court ban on running for public office, the result of a
conviction for assaulting a Socialist deputy. Le Pen has appealed
the conviction, an act that automatically suspends the ruling until
a decision is made.
	   Le Pen had said earlier that his wife -- not Megret -- would run
in his place if he were unable to be a candidate.
	   However, last month, the European Parliament voted to lift Le
Pen's parliamentary immunity so German prosecutors can investigate
whether he broke laws that make trivializing the Holocaust a crime.
	   Unmoved, Le Pen announced that his party hopes to win more than
20 percent of the vote in the elections.
	   The National Front normally wins about 15 percent in elections.

Clashes over prisoners continue; hunger strikes expands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinians &QL; 
 &UR; By DANA BUDEIRI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Clashes over the release of
Palestinian prisoners spread Monday throughout the West Bank, and a
prisoners' group said its hunger strike would continue until Israel
releases all its Palestinian prisoners.
	   The Palestinian Prisoners Association urged Palestinians to
stage an ``intefadeh'' _ or uprising _ until all Palestinian
prisoners are released, Palestinian legislator Fares Kadoura told
protesters in the Palestinian-controlled town of Ramallah.
	   ``The Palestinians in Israeli jails announce that our revolution
has started,'' Kadoura said, reading from a statement.
	   Israel released 250 Palestinian prisoners last month out of 750
promised it the U.S.-brokered Wye River accords, signed in October.
	   Palestinians are angry that most of those released were accused
of common crimes and want Israel to release ``security prisoners''
_ those detained without trial under prevention of terror measures.
	   Kadoura, who is a member of the team negotiating the prisoners
release with Israel, said that a hunger strike begun last week by
hundreds of prisoners had now spread to all four Israeli jails and
among all 3,000 Palestinian prisoners.
	   Prisons Authority spokeswoman Orit Messer-Harel said she knew of
only 514 prisoners striking at two prisons since Friday. There had
been no health problems so far, she said.
	   Israel would not heed the protests, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said.
	   ``They want to impose on Israel to release murderers,'' he said
on a tour of an archaeological dig in Jerusalem's Old City. ``I
don't free murderers.''
	   He did not address demands for the release of others not accused
of being involved in killings, including members of banned militant
groups.
	   In recent weeks, Israel and the Palestinians have accused one
another of failing to live up to various provisions, and Israel has
threatened to hold off on a scheduled Dec. 18 troop pullback. That
could poison next week's planned visit to the region.
	   Clashes took place in at least five West Bank locations,
including some controlled by the Palestinian Authority. Most
injuries were minor.
	   Stone-throwing protesters ambushed Israeli vehicles in Abu Dis,
a village east of Jerusalem. One Israeli in a pickup truck fired on
the protesters, wounding one of them in the thigh.
	   The driver of the pickup truck said his passenger _ whom he
would not identify _ opened fire because they felt their lives were
in danger.
	   ``Suddenly 100-200 Arabs with big stones surrounded us around
the car,'' the driver, who would only give his name as Michael,
told Associated Press Television. ``They want to kill us.''
	   The wounded Palestinian was later listed in moderate condition
in hospital.
	   In the city of Nablus in the northern West Bank, 200 Palestinian
riot police clashed with about 3,000 protesters demanding that the
Authority increase pressure on Israel to release the prisoners.
	   One prisoner's mother, Jazer Hamami, accused the Palestinian
police of being more brutal than the Israelis.
	   ``When the Israeli soldiers were here, none of them beat
women,'' she said.

Ruling coalition and opposition in deadlock
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ As the government plans to carry
through tough new economic reforms, Romania's political parties
Monday remained in a deadlock which has led to opposition lawmakers
boycotting parliament for three weeks.
	   ``We should find solutions together to recreate democratic
relations between us,'' said Ion Diaconescu, the head of the
National Peasant Party, the main force of the ruling coalition.
	   Last week, Premier Radu Vasile asked President Emil
Constantinescu to urge parliament to support tough reform measures
he plans to introduce in the next few weeks.
	   Led by Vasile, the government intends to close several
money-losing state enterprises over the next weeks. Tens of
thousands of jobs are expected to be axed.
	   Three opposition parties withdrew from parliament 20 days ago
after their attempts to stage a no-confidence vote against the
government were stymied by the majority.
	   The opposition said it would return to parliament if the
government took responsibility for alleged mistakes in the last two
years. They also asked the government to reconsider hiking food and
energy prices.
	   ``This government is lacking efficiency and responsibility and
the best solution to solve the crisis is for it to resign,'' said
Corneliu Vadim Tudor leader of the extremist Greater Romania Party,
quoted by national radio.
	   The Party of Social Democracy, the Party of National Unity and
the Greater Romania Party have 199 seats in the 486-seat two
chamber legislature.
	   Since reformist parties came to power two years ago, the
coalition government has been paralyzed by rifts between the four
main parties. This is the first major standoff with the opposition.
	   The ruling coalition and opposition decided to set up three
committees to analyze and solve their political disputes. Until
then, the opposition will continue to boycott parliament for
regular sessions.
	   In the last two years, purchasing power and production have
dropped, provoking street protests. Unemployment is 8.6 percent and
the salaries are often paid late. The average salary is about 1.2
million lei (dlrs 120)

Yeltsin fires key aides during a brief visit from hospital

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Briefly returning to work with a bang, President
Boris Yeltsin fired several top aides Monday and assumed personal
control of two key government agencies during a surprise foray into
the Kremlin.
	   After just three hours at his office, Yeltsin returned to the
government hospital where he has been for the past two weeks. The
Kremlin shakeup removed four top aides, some of whom had publicly
questioned the president's health in recent weeks.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin was quoted by
presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin as telling the aides.
	   Yeltsin's actions showed that the ailing president still has
authority, but did not directly address serious problems such as
the country's economic crisis.
	   The president has said almost nothing about the deepening
economic problems, yet he remains extremely sensitive to any
suggestions that he's not fit to govern.
	   The president's decision to begin overseeing the Justice
Ministry and tax police was seen as mostly symbolic, since the
actual heads of those organizations will stay in place.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin will remain in the hospital as long as
necessary to fully recuperate from pneumonia, Yakushkin said. He
refused to say when Yeltsin will be released, adding that it would
depend on the treatment.
	   Yeltsin dismissed Chief of Staff Valentin Yumashev and his
deputies Yuri Yarov, Mikhail Komissar and Yevgeny Savostyanov.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff, while the
other posts remain vacant. Bordyuzha, who will serve in both posts,
was chief of the Border Guards before his appointment to the
security post earlier this year.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin had dismissed the aides because of their
failure to stem crime or respond to several incidents of political
extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist deputy in
the Russian parliament.
	   ``That undermines confidence in the president and in the
government as a whole, and that is inadmissible in the current
difficult economic situation,'' the spokesman said.
	   Yeltsin has a habit of unexpected and often unexplained
dismissals. The latest round of ousters was also thought to reflect
his unhappiness over the aides' unusual candidness about his health
in recent weeks.
	   Yumashev and other Kremlin aides openly said that Yeltsin is too
weak to handle day-to-day affairs or to make foreign trips and
suggested he leave control of the economy and other current affairs
to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   The Russian media has said that the aides were further eroding
Yeltsin's power. The dismissed aides handled the president's
schedule and other workings in the Kremlin and had considerable
influence.
	   ``The president wanted to show who is the boss,'' said Alexander
Shokhin, the head of the moderate, pro-government faction, Our Home
Is Russia. ``He's like a lion who licked his wounds and now roared
at those who thought he was already out of the game.''
	   Ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky praised the president for
cleaning the Kremlin of what he described as corrupt, weak
``slime,'' while Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov added his support.
	   Communists have long assailed the Yeltsin aides, but the No. 2
in the Communist Party hierarchy, Valentin Kuptsov, criticized
Yeltsin anyway.
	   ``After every illness or holiday of the president we always
expect inexplicable personnel reshuffling,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin's decision to become more involved in the Justice
Ministry appeared aimed at stepping up the fight against endemic
corruption and other crime, Yakushkin said.
	   A top democratic lawmaker, Galina Starovoitova, was murdered
last month in St. Petersburg in an apparent contract killing. Her
unexplained death outraged and shocked many Russians.
	   Yeltsin all but disappeared from sight when he entered a
government hospital Nov. 22 with pneumonia, the latest in a long
string of health problems in recent years for the Russian leader.
	   Many of Yeltsin's opponents claim he hasn't been seriously
involved in national affairs for a long time and is no longer fit
to lead.
	   Despite calls for his resignation, Yeltsin and his doctors
insist that the president will serve out his term, which ends in
2000.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ High voltage electricity killed a miner
in southern Bulgaria, officials said Monday.
	   Feizi Shekirov, 31, died Sunday after being hit by 6,000 volts
at a generator unit in the Burieva mine near the town of Madan, 300
kilometers (188 miles) southeast of Sofia.
	   Mine officials said Shekirov ignored safety instructions.
	   Three other miners have died in industrial accidents over the

their poor safety and loose technological discipline.

Former premier sued for libel and insult
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria's former premier Zhan Videnov
appeared in court Monday to face charges of libel and insult by a
businessman.
	   Atanas Tilev, a Bulgarian-born German businessman, is suing
Videnov for leva 15 million (some dlrs 9,000) as the former premier
accused in a book the businessman of shady dealings in Bulgaria.
	   If found guilty, Videnov could be sentenced to up to three years
in prison, the state news agency BTA said.
	   Videnov and Tilev have become bitter foes since a bank Tilev
owned in Bulgaria went bankrupt in the end of Videnov's tenure
1994-1996. Tilev has accused a group of business people close to
Videnov of illeaglly syphoning money out of his bank.
	   Bulgaria is seeking two of the group on embezzlement charges
after they fled abroad last year.
	   The court on Monday ppsotponed the hearing until January on a
request by Tilev's lawyer. The attorney asked for the postponement
to discuss with his client a deal the court suggested. Tilev is
currently abroad. He has cancelled a number of investments in
Bulgaria last year.
	   While addressing reporters in front of the court room Videnov
defiantly dismissed Tilev's accusations.
	   ``Tilev's charges against me are grotesque and absurd,'' Videnov
told BTA. ``Every of my statements reflects the truth and I can
prove them.''
	   Videnov resigned as premier and leader of his Socialist Party of
former Communists in Dec. 1996 after plunging Bulgaria in an
unprecedented economic crisis.
	   A month of street protests, triggered by poverty and burgeoning
crime, forced the Socialists to agree to early elections in April
1997, which they lost to their opponents of the pro-western Union
of Democratic Forces.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, reflecting
growing Israeli unease over U.S. President Bill Clinton's upcoming
visit, suggested Monday that the trip was entirely at the
initiative of the American leader.
	   ``What am I going to tell him, not to come _ don't come? I can
prevent him from coming?'' Netanyahu asked rhetorically in an
interview on army radio. ``We're not accustomed to refusing someone
who wants to come.''
	   In another sign of tensions arising from the trip, the speaker
of Israel's parliament, Dan Tichon, said he intended to boycott
Clinton-connected events to protest the fact that the president did
not plan to address the Knesset.
	   Clinton's visit to Israel, which begins Saturday, is to be
coupled with a stop in the Gaza Strip, the first by a sitting U.S.
president.
	   The United States has repeatedly said the trip is not intended
as an endorsement of Palestinian statehood aspirations, but the
Palestinians see it as a powerful boost to their sovereignty hopes.
	   On Monday, speaking to reporters in Gaza, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat hailed the upcoming trip as ``historical and great.''
	   The presidential visit to Israel and the Palestinian lands is
meant to encourage both sides to stick to the timetable set out in
the Wye River accords signed in October.
	   Netanyahu said Clinton's trip ``has value only if he strengthens
the Palestinian fulfillment of their obligations'' under the
agreement.
	   He continued to deny U.S. administration claims that he had
initiated Clinton's visit _ but insisted that Clinton would
nonetheless be received warmly
	   In recent weeks, Israel and the Palestinians have accused one
another of failing to live up to various provisions, and Israel has
threatened to hold off on a scheduled Dec. 18 troop pullback.
	   Palestinians, for their part, are angry over stepped-up Jewish
settlement activity in the West Bank and Israel's failure to free
hundreds of so-called security prisoners, jailed for anti-Israel
activity.
	   Israel released the first 250 of a promised 750 Palestinian
prisoners last month, but they were mainly criminals, not security
prisoners as the Palestinians have demanded.
	   In response, Palestinians have been staging protests that have
repeatedly boiled over into violent street clashes.
	   More clashes with between protesters and Israeli and Palestinian
troops took place Monday in several West Bank towns.
	   Also, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners were continuing a hunger
strike begun over the weekend. A prisoners' association said the
hunger strike now included all 3,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails,
although the Israeli Prisons Service said it knew of only 514
taking part.
	   The controversy over Clinton's visit also comes as Netanyahu is
trying to quell a potential parliamentary rebellion. Opposition
from within the coalition to Israel's ceding of West Bank land has
forced Netanyahu to seek new allies to prop up his government.
	   A vote on early elections was possible later Monday, but the
prime minister's opponents may not push the issue forward if they
lack the votes.
	   Netanyahu has been sparring publicly with his former foreign
minister, David Levy, who considered rejoining the shaky governing
coalition in exchange for the finance minister's job.
	   The prime minister said the two couldn't agree on economic
principles and that he wouldn't sacrifice Israel's economy to
coalition politics.
	   Levy's spokesman said he would not renew negotiations with
Netanyahu and would support early elections. ``It's final,'' Alon
Amron said.
	   The Clinton visit has added to already-simmering tensions within
the government. At Sunday's Israeli Cabinet meeting, a shouting
match broke out over it, according to Israel radio.
	   ``Who invited President Clinton to the Gaza Strip?'' Silvan
Shalom, the science minister, reportedly yelled at Netanyahu.
Netanyahu said it had been Clinton's idea, not his.
	   In Gaza, Clinton is to be on hand for a meeting on Monday at
which Palestinians will reaffirm the nullification of clauses in
their national charter calling for Israel's destruction.

Birds and bugs bedeviling games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ First it was bugs, now it's the birds.
Assorted beasties seem bent on harassing athletes at the Asian
Games.
	   The Chinese team has lodged a formal complaint that its
weightlifters were being showered by insulation foam. The culprits:
sparrows trying to build nests in the rooftop of the indoor
weightlifting arena.
	   Small pieces of foam have been falling on the exact spot where
the lifters are to compete.
	   ``The heaviest downpour is right at the center of the
competition area and we have to sweep it up every 30 minutes,'' the
Bangkok Post quoted a Thai weightlifting official as saying.
	   Col. Jakrit Intharatat, secretary-general of the Weightlifting
Association of Thailand, said the falling foam could cause serious
problems for competitors, and the International Weightlifting
Confederation might not approve the venue.
	   As officials scurried to find a solution before the start of
competition later Monday, anti-bug patrols fanned out to several
other venues to control mosquitoes and other insects.
	   The first alarm was raised when an usual number of insects were
discovered in the Asian Games swimming pool last week. Since then
there have been complaints that mosquitoes infiltrate some indoor
arenas as the sun sets.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TAIWAN'S TENPINS: With one world champion and three gold
medalists from the last games, Taiwan's bowling team is expected to
roll to victory at the 13th Asian Games.
	   The team includes Tseng Su-fen, the former women's world
champion and gold winner at the Hiroshima Asian Games four years
ago, as well as Hiroshima gold medalists Lin Han-cheng and Chou
Miao-lin.
	   Ten gold medals are at stake in the bowling competition, which
begins Wednesday. South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and
Thailand are also fielding strong squads.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CAN'T MISS BRONZE: Win some, lose some, say the Thais.
	   The hosts of the Asian Games got a guaranteed bronze medal after
Siwaporn Mayer received a first-round bye in the taekwondo
competition.
	   But her three teammates will be facing tough competitors from
South Korea, China and Taiwan when the Asian martial art event
begins Monday.
	   Meanwhile, Thailand was guaranteed not to get any medals in the
men's 4-kilometer pursuit because most of the cyclists were
declared unfit.
	   Only Panupong Maneepong and Thongchai Wankerdjai-ngarm were able
to complete the 12-lap race in training while the rest of the team
could not keep up after the halfway point, ruining the team
combination.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ECONOMY ROUTE TO GOLD: By trying to save some yen, the parents
of Naoko Takahashi set the Japanese marathon runner on the road to
a near-world record performance at the Asian Games.
	   With her parents cheering ``Gambare, gambare! (Fight hard, fight
hard!),'' Takahashi grabbed the games' first gold Sunday by winning
the women's marathon in the fifth best time ever.
	   In her early teens, when she asked her parents which school club
to join in her hometown of Gifu, they strongly suggested athletics.
	   ``They said to join the least expensive one, which was the
athletics club,'' the 26-year-old said. ``They were right.''
	   Their advice paid off as Takahashi glided into the games' main
stadium in a time of 2 hours, 21 minutes, 47 seconds _ less than a
minute off the world mark.
	   ``I could see my parents and I heard them crying out, `Gambare,
gambare.' It was wonderful,'' the petite runner said.
	   Takahashi, who runs and works for a chemical company in Nagoya,
is regarded as a top contender for the marathon crown at the 2000
Olympics.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TICKET BONANZA: Thailand, which badly needs to revive its
economy, expects to reap 200 million baht (dlrs 5.6 million) from
ticket sales at the Asian Games, the organizers said Monday.
	   It got off to a good start by collecting 63 million baht (dlrs
1.7 million) from tickets sold at the games' opening ceremony
Sunday. The 60,000-seat stadium appeared filled to capacity.
	   An official release said only a few more tickets were left for
the closing ceremony Dec. 20.

Russian ruble plunges further, World Bank team arrives for talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW grafs 5-9 with Russian delegation to discuss debt
rescheduling with Paris Club, inflation estimates for 1999, other
details, ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A World Bank team arrived in Moscow for more loan
talks Monday as the battered Russian ruble resumed its slide,
heading toward a new low since the financial crisis hit in August.
	   The World Bank team was to reconsider the terms of a earlier
promised dlrs 1.5 billion loan for structural reform, as well as a
dlrs 800 million social reform credit and a dlrs 800 million loan
to streamline the ailing coal industry, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The team will make recommendations to the World Bank board of
directors later this month, when it discusses its plans for Russia.
	   The loans are part of an IMF-led dlrs 22.6 billion bailout
package that was agreed upon before economic crisis forced the
government to devalue the ruble and default on some debts in
August.
	   Russia is also seeking to reschedule at least a portion of dlrs
17.5 billion in foreign debt payments due next year. A government
delegation will leave for talks on debt rescheduling with the Paris
Club of creditor nations on Dec. 9, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported Monday.
	   Meanwhile, the ruble plunged again in trading Monday, hitting
20.4 to the dollar, down 0.8 rubles from Friday.
	   The ruble sold for more than 20 to the dollar for a couple of
days shortly after the country's economic crisis hit in mid-August
before making a mild comeback. The ruble was at about 6 to the
dollar before the crisis.
	   With Russian financial markets virtually wiped out by the
crisis, the ruble has become the main indicator of economic
confidence. Its fall reflects fears that the government will flood
the economy with a lot of new cash to pay its huge debts _ a move
that is certain to trigger high inflation.
	   The Russian government wants to keep inflation at 30 percent
next year, but the Central Bank conceded that ``certain
conditions'' may push the inflation to up to 55 percent, Interfax
reported.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet has said it may have
to print large amounts of money if international lenders, including
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, don't release
the loan package agreed last summer and put on hold after the
crisis hit.
	   In talks last week, the IMF urged Russia to provide a realistic
budget for next year as a key condition for resuming loans, but
showed no sign that it would free the money any time soon.
	   Until the IMF acts, other foreign lenders are unlikely to give
Russia the infusion of cash it needs to pay workers, pensioners and
foreign creditors.

At least 10 killed in fighting in southern Somali port town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with WFP saying ship unaffected, adds details on
delegation visit

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ At least 10 people were killed and
more than 15 wounded in clashes between rival militiamen in the
southern Somali port town of Merca, reports from the town said
Monday.
	   Fighting between rival factions of the Habar Gidir clan erupted
Sunday in downtown Merca, about 100 kilometers (65 miles) south of
the capital Mogadishu, forcing local markets to close, according to
witnesses contacted by VHF radio.
	   Three people were killed and five wounded during an early
exchange between the rival Eyr and Sa'ad subclans, which control
different parts of Merca, witnesses said.
	   Later in the evening, fighting intensified around the hospital,
where a prominent militiaman was being treated for wounds suffered
earlier in the day. Another seven people, including a woman
bystander, were killed and 10 wounded, the reports said.
	   A U.N. World Food Program ship, which was off-loading food aid
at the Merca port, was not affected by the fighting, the agency
said Monday.
	   It was unclear what sparked Sunday's clashes, but it may be
connected to fighting between the same factions two months ago at
Shalambod, a town 15 kilometers (10 miles) north of Merca.
	   Sunday's fighting followed Saturday's visit of an international
peace delegation which included Italy's ambassador to Somalia. The
port town is a large export-import hub for Italian businessmen.
	   The delegation had planned to go to Mogadishu to meet with Ali
Mahdi Mohamed and Hussein Mohamed Aidid, former rivals who joined
forces recently to set up a municipal administration for Mogadishu,
and also with their opponents Hussein Hajji Bod and Ali Osman Atto
to try to iron out differences between the factions.
	   The delegation decided at the last minute to land in Merca after
assessing security at the north Mogadishu airstrip was
insufficient, according to an international aid worker who asked
not to be identified.
	   Aidid, a Sa'ad, and Ali Mahdi, took offense and told the
delegation to leave Somalia, which it did the same day.
	   Aid agencies use the Merca airstrip as a transit point since it
is more secure than north Mogadishu, bringing foreign currency into
Merca and upsetting the Mogadishu administration.
	   A demonstration of Aidid and Ali Mahdi supporters in Mogadishu
Sunday burned Italian flags and accused Italian Ambassador
Francesco Shortino of undermining efforts to reunite the formerly
divided capital.
	   Somalia has been wracked by clan fighting and civil war since
faction leaders collaborated in 1991 to oust President Mohamed Siad
Barre, but afterwards turned on each other.
	   Somalia has since been without a central government, and carved
into faction-controlled fiefdoms protected by fighting militiamen.

Dalai Lama notes anniversy of Universal Declaration of Human
</HEADLINE>
Rights &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The Dalai Lama said Monday he was
encouraged that worldwide celebrations were planned for the 50th
anniversary of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.
	   ``People everywhere have come to realize the great importance
and value of human rights,'' the Tibetan Buddhist leader said in a
statement released from Dharmsala, the northern Indian town where
he has lived in exile since fleeing his homeland following a failed
anti-Beijing uprising in 1959.
	   The Dalai Lama, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize, has led a
campaign seeking greater autonomy for Tibet within China, and
accused China of trying to smother the Tibetans' language and their
distinct way of life and worship. Beijing denies the charges and
says the Dalai Lama is trying to split China.
	   ``Some governments have contended that the standards of human
rights laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are
those advocated by the West and do not apply to Asia and other
parts of the Third World because of differences in culture, social
and economic development,'' the Dalai Lama said Monday, without
directly mentioning China. ``I do not share this view and I am
convinced that the majority of ordinary people do not support it
either.''
	   The U.N. human rights declaration adopted Dec. 10, 1948 declares
``all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights,''
and that their basic rights include that of life, economic
well-being and freedom of expression.

EU foreign ministers approve task force to coordinate asylum

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union foreign ministers Monday
agreed to create a task force to coordinate measures for containing
the flow of asylum seekers and illegal immigrants into the
15-nation bloc.
	   ``The problem of mass influxes of asylum seekers and illegal
immigrants raised the need to establish a common integrated ...
approach, targeted at the situation in the most important countries
of origin of asylum seekers and migrants,'' the ministers said in a
statement.
	   The force, comprised of high-level immigration officials, will
pool ideas on how to limit the influx and ensure EU nations share
more evenly the task of receiving them.
	   The force should present a report on proposed joint-EU measures
to a special summit on the issue scheduled for October 1999 in
Tampere, Finland.
	   Several EU nations, including Italy, Britain, Belgium, Germany
and the Netherlands, have all faced big increases in asylum
applicants over the past year. Some have set up tented villages to
house them while demands are processed.
	   Asylum applications have risen 30 percent this year in Britain
and stand at 33,000 for the first ten months of 1998. In Belgium
applications are up by 57 percent this year. Overall Germany is the
biggest recipient nation, processing some 30 percent of the EU's
asylum cases. In November alone, 10,800 new demands were registered
in Germany.

Yemen: Amicable solution to border dispute with Saudi possible
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Yemen has not given up hope for an ``amicable and
peaceful'' solution for its border dispute with Saudi Arabia, its
foreign minister said in remarks published Monday.
	   ``We have not yet reached the point of despair ... or a closed
door,'' Abdul-Qader Bajamal, who also serves as deputy premier,
told Kuwait's Al-Siyassah daily.
	   ``There is still hope for reaching an amicable and peaceful
solution'' before having to resort to arbitration, the Yemeni
official said.
	   Yemen, on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula, has long contested
Saudi Arabia's claim to three Red Sea islands and parts of the
Empty Quarter, a vast desert region with potentially lucrative oil
fields. The two nations have yet to demarcate their border.
	   Frustrated by lack of progress in talks, Yemen has said it would
consider seeking international arbitration.
	   But Bajamal said that while arbitration would ``close the files
of the past,'' an amicable solution reached by the two sides
themselves would ``lay the foundations for the future.''
	   Fighting has occasionally erupted along the 2,000-kilometer
(1,300-mile) frontier between the two countries.

China's men defend Asian Games gymnastics title

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's male gymnasts eclipsed the
competition from South Korea and Japan in defending their Asian
Games team title Monday, opening what threatens to be another
Chinese takeover of the gymnastics competition.
	   A jubilant South Korea won a tight contest with Japan for
silver, defending its runner-up title from the last games in
Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994.
	   ``We haven't beaten the Japanese since the Hiroshima Asian
Games, so this is revenge,'' said Park Jong-hoon, a South Korean
coach. ``I'm very pleased.''
	   Theirs was a fascinating duel. Japan led South Korea after the
first discipline by more than half a point. But South Korea clawed
its way back with a strong showing in the vault, its second
discipline, only to drop back later in the competition.
	   The South Koreans went into the last round trailing the Japanese
by close to half a point. But minutes later, with a strong showing
on the pommel horse while Japan stumbled on the floor, they had
fought their way back again to secure the silver with 225.750
points to 225.375 for Japan, once again the bronze medalist.
	   China's team of veterans and newcomers led from its opening
discipline, the vault. Showing greater power, speed, strength,
consistency and technique than the other teams, the Chinese
finished with 230.200 points, nearly a five-point cushion over the
second-place Koreans.
	   The Chinese, whose men have won every Asian Games team contest
since 1974, said they viewed the competition as a tune-up for the
2000 Olympic Games.
	   ``This is training the troops,'' said coach Huang Yubin.
	   The team suffered a blow going into the competition when Lu
Yufu, a vault specialist, tore a knee ligament in training and had
to return to China.
	   But coach Huang said he still expects Lu to compete at the
Olympics.
	   ``I'm very happy today for two reasons: one is that we got the
gold, the other is that we heard from China that his injury is not
too serious,'' he said.
	   Despite losing the silver, there was some consolation for Japan.
Naoya Tsukahara, whose father was a five-time Olympic gold
medalist, stood fourth in individual points, behind three Chinese,
which could bode well for his chances of a medal later in the week.
	   The top 36 gymnasts in the team event qualify for the contest to
find the best all-around gymnast on Wednesday, The top eight
finishers in each discipline will also battle for individual medals
Thursday.
	   China will be looking for a clean sweep of the team titles when
its powerful squad of diminutive teen-age girls battles to retain
the women's team championship Tuesday.
	   The team includes four veterans of the squad that captured
bronze at last year's World Championships and two relative
newcomers, including 16-year-old Xu Jing from Beijing, who stands
just 1.43 meters (4 feet, 8 1/4 inches) tall and weighs just 35
kilograms (77 pounds).
	   China's women swept all the gold at Hiroshima, led by gymnast Mo
Huilan, who took all four individual apparatus titles.
	   Team coach Qian Kui said the squad had no one of Mo's quality
and replied, ``It's very hard so say,'' when asked whether China's
women were expected to sweep again.
	   The team veterans include Kui Yuanyuan, who won a World
Championship gold in 1996 on the floor, and bronze on balance beam
at the 1997 worlds; Meng Fei, silver medalist on the uneven bars at
last year's worlds; Liu Xuan, a beam bronze medalist at the 1996
worlds and a gold medal winner, again on beam, at this year's World
Cup in Sabae, Japan; and 17-year-old Bi Wenjing, who got bronze on
the uneven bars at the 1997 worlds and a gold in the same event at
the World Cup.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Urging India to use ``good sense,''
the prime minister of Pakistan-held Kashmir warned India's prime
minister Monday against inflammatory rhetoric in a region that is a
certain flash point for nuclear war.
	   Prime Minister of Pakistan's Azad Kashmir, Choudhry Sultan
Mahmood assailed recent statements by Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee in which he accused Pakistan of military
interference in Kashmir. Vajpayee also vowed Monday not to give
``even an inch'' of Kashmir to Pakistan.
	   ``I hope that good sense will prevail and that the Indian
government will realize that it already has failed to hold on to
Kashmir,'' Mahmood told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview. ``They have ruined their reputation and have paid a
heavy price in blood and money.''
	   Tens of thousands of Indian soldiers have been deployed in Hindu
India's only Muslim-dominated state of Kashmir in an attempt to
quell a bloody uprising that has continued for 10 years. Muslim
secessionist are demanding either outright independence or union
with Islamic Pakistan.
	   While India says Pakistan is arming and training militants,
Pakistan says its support is limited to moral and political aid.
	   Pakistan wants the Kashmir dispute settled by a United Nations
sponsored vote that would let Kashmiris decide whether a united
Kashmir should be with India or Pakistan.
	   Since India and Pakistan exploded underground nuclear devices in
May and declared themselves nuclear powers, the international
community has recognized the disputed region as a flash point of a
possible nuclear war.
	   The two hostile neighbors have fought two wars over Kashmir, a
third over Bangladesh or what was then East Pakistan and came
dangerously close to a fourth conflagration in 1990 again over
Kashmir.
	   ``After the nuclear tests the international community has
realized that the core issue between Pakistan and India is
Kashmir,'' said Mahmood. ``Through the pressure of the
international community India will come to the negotiation table.''
	   But so far India has steadfastly refused international
mediation, but Mahmood warned that New Delhi's intransigence may
back fire.
	   ``India has been giving the world the impression that Pakistan
is an Islamic fundamentalist state that doesn't want a solution,
but now with Vajpayee's statements the world will understand that
it is India that does not want a solution,'' he said.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with grafs 2, 6, 7 and 8 quotes from police chief,
warning of further arrests

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Police and paramilitary Rangers swept
through troubled neighborhoods of southern Karachi and arrested 25
suspected ethnic militants Monday following a weekend of violent
protests.
	   However, police warned of further arrests throughout the week.
	   The men were arrested in Liaqatabad neighborhood in the heart of
this violent port city, said police spokesman Fazi Uzman. Uzman
told The Associated Press that police also uncovered a hidden room
he called ``a torture cell.''
	   Police believe it was run by militant members of the Muttaheda
Qami Movement (MQM), a group that claims to represent Indian Muslim
immigrants to Pakistan after the Asian subcontinent gained its
independence from Britain in 1947.
	   Several years ago the MQM split into rival factions that
routinely clash. Their bitter feuding has turned entire
neighborhoods in Karachi, a bustling city of 14 million people,
into battlefields.
	   Karachi Police Chief Farooq Amin Qureshi said Monday that his
policemen had taken up position on rooftops of several buildings in
the troubled Liaqatabad neighborhood.
	   As well his men have taken control of many of the narrow
alleyways that the militants often use to hide.
	   ``We have broken the terrorist hold in the area and managed to
enter the narrow alleys.'' Qureshi said in a telephone interview.
``In the first stage we have posted police on the rooftop.''
	   On Sunday one person was killed and eight people wounded,
including four policemen, said police and eyewitnesses. Militants
hurled hand grenades at a police station and fired rocket launchers
at policemen.
	   ``Lots of people just left the area and those who remained
behind hid inside and listened to the constant gunfire,'' said
Raheel Ahmed, 35, a resident of the area.
	   The day-long violence was to protest a decision last month by
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to impose federal rule in the troubled
province. He dismissed the government, ordered the governor to rule
and brought in the army to set up military courts that would try
suspected terrorists.
	   Mutilated bodies of MQM members are routinely found in Karachi,
often hidden in garbage bins and empty fields. Some carry notes
identifying the victims as rivals or police informers.
	   Kunwar Khalid Younis, spokesman for the MQM's largest faction
led by exiled leader Altaf Hussein, denied accusations that his
activists were involved in torture.
	   ``It's just not true ... it's easy to put a knife in a room and
say this is a torture cell,'' he said.
	   Younis, whose faction is the dominant political group in
Karachi, has accused Sharif's government of trying to erode the
MQM's support.
	   The MQM is demanding recognition in Pakistan as a fifth ethnic
group like Punjabis, Pathans, Baluch and Sindhis. The MQM has
accused successive governments of discrimination.

Tajima trounces Chinese rivals

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japanese swimmer Yasuko Tajima trounced
China's world record holders Chen Yan and Wu Yanyan to claim the
women's 400-meter medley gold medal at the Asian Games Monday.
	   China won the opening two swim golds and was expected to take
the third with event record holder Chen and 200-meter medley record
holder Wu in the field.
	   But Tajima, third behind Chen in the event at this year's world
championships, finished in 4 minutes, 39.92 seconds, well ahead of
Wu (4:46.74) and Chen (4:47.34).
	   Her victory, and a triumph by men's 200-meter freestyle swimmer
Yosuke Ichikawa, gave Japan two golds to China's three after the
latter claimed the women's 4x200-meter freestyle victory.
	   ``My goals are to win a gold medal at the Sydney Olympics, and
to get the world record,'' Tajima said. ``The Chinese were good in
Perth but tonight I knew they weren't in their best condition. You
don't have a chance often to beat them so you have to take it. But
I want to meet them in their best condition.''
	   Chen set the world record at 4:34.79 last year and backed it up
by winning the world title in Perth in January. Tajima said she saw
Chen's coach massaging her shoulder after the race, indicating a
possible injury.
	   Chen got a poor start in the butterfly Monday and was fourth
after 100 meters but headed into the final 100 meters of freestyle
in second. But Tajima, 17, increased her margin from four seconds
as Chen struggled down the stretch, unable to stop Wu from taking
silver.
	   Dual world championship medalist Shan Ying gave China a good
start to the battle for 32 golds when she powered to victory in the
100-meter freestyle in an outside lane.
	   Shan, who claimed bronze medals in the 50- and 100-meter double
at the Perth world meet earlier this year, was second-slowest
qualifier for the final and had to win from Lane 1.
	   She turned in front at 50 meters and finished in 56.20 seconds.
China's Chao Na and Japan's Sumika Minamoto, the fastest qualifier,
had a dead heat for silver in 56.39 seconds.
	   ``My mental and physical state is very good,'' Shan said. ``I
believed I would win.''
	   China is returning to the Asian Games four years after a drugs
scandal in Hiroshima, Japan. China won a remarkable 25 golds to
Japan's five in 1994 but seven of its swim team and 11 athletes
overall were found later to have used steroids. China also
dominated its home games in Beijing in 1990 with 20 golds.
	   After six team members were sent home in disgrace from the Perth
meet, China has claimed its team is free of drugs for this event.
All swimmers were tested before leaving for Bangkok. Medley swimmer
Xiong Guoming is back after he was one of the seven who returned a
positive test in Hiroshima.
	   Shan said the team was not affected by the drugs scandals.
	   ``We have no pressure on us here,'' Shan said. ``All of our
members are drug free. Our government conducted very strict tests
on us before we left.''
	   China was on an early path to another Asian Games triumph as
Zeng Qiliang followed Shan's win with victory in the men's
100-meter breaststroke.
	   Zeng, who won the silver medal at the Perth world championships
behind Olympic champion Frederick Deburghgraeve of Belgium,
outclassed his rivals Monday. He finished in 1 minute, 2.32 seconds
for a comfortable win over Japan's Akira Hayashi (1:02.55) and
Malaysia's Elvin Chia (1:03.09).
	   A capacity crowd watched the opening swim session, organizers
asking parents to put their children on their laps so more could
cram in.
	   They made most noise in the men's 200-meter freestyle when
Ichikawa (1:52.46) edged local hope Torlap Sethsothorn (1:52.53)
after the Thai seemed set to claim the gold.
	   The pool has been the subject of controversy over a bug
infestation and organizers have been treating the water. The air
was thick with bugs Monday but breaststroker Chia said it more a
problem in the warm-up pool.
	   ``There's a lot of bugs under the water there but it's not so
bad in the main pool,'' Chia said.
	   There were plenty of bugs outside the pool. A ramshackle strip
of bars across the street from the new pool blared loud music late
in the meet and it almost overpowered the final Chinese anthem.
	   Elsewhere the organization was a shambles. A mixed zone for
journalists to meet swimmers was the size and style of a prison
cell, and swimmers were not brought in for media conferences.

 &UR; Jailed former No. 2 Malaysian leader questions delay in release of
report

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Jailed former Malaysian deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Monday criticized a delay in the
release of a government report on alleged police brutality against
him.
	   Anwar, who is on trial facing charges of abuse of power and
sexual misconduct, also questioned the rational for bringing in
another forensic expert to help Attorney-General Mohtar Abdullah
further study the report.
	   In a press statement read by his wife, Dr. Wan Azizah Wan
Ismail, near the Federal Court where he is being tried, Anwar said
he did not see the need for another medical expert or any further
delay in the release of the report.
	   Anwar said he had already been examined by experts appointed by
the government and by his family.
	   On Saturday, the attorney-general appointed Dr. Abdul Rahman
Yusof of the Kuala Lumpur Hospital to help with follow-up
investigations into Anwar's allegation that he was beaten in
September while being held in special detention under the Internal
Security Act.
	   Others have called on the government to make the report public
as well.
	   An opposition leader in Parliament, Lim Kit Siang, asked in a
statement released Saturday why after two and a half months there
was still no sign the report would be released anytime soon.
	   Anwar has alleged he was beaten by police on Sept. 20. Nine days
later he appeared in court with a black eye and bruises on his
body.
	   A independent police team was ordered to investigate the
allegations and the team's report has been forwarded to the
attorney-general's office.

 &UR; Party without platform or leader wins majority in Nigeria's local
elections &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with latest elections results,
praise from elections monitors. TRIMS outdated material. No pickup.
Final results expected later Monday. &QL; 
 &UR; By GLENN McKENZIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC;

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Although it has an unclear platform and no
leader, a party opposed to the rule of a Nigeria's late military
dictator has won more than half of the seats in key local
elections, an official said Monday.
	   The weekend vote, seen as a test of the planned transition from
military rule to democracy in this ethnically-divided West African
country, was praised by elections observers from the Commonwealth
of Britain and its former colonies.
	   In a statement, Commonwealth Secretary General Emeka Anyaokou,
himself a Nigerian, said the ``successful conduct of the vote''
bodes well for upcoming state and presidential elections.
	   Voters turned out in huge numbers for the polls although there
were reported logistical glitches and clashes that reportedly
killed 14 people. The Commonwealth sent a 17-member observer team.
	   Nigeria's military leader Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who took
over when the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha died earlier this
year, has engineered the transition and pledged to hand over power
to elected civilians on May 29.
	   An election official speaking on condition of anonymity said the
Peoples' Democratic Party had won at least 390 of the 774 local
council posts. In distant second place was the PDP's main rival,
the All Peoples' Party with 145 seats, while the Alliance for
Democracy has 80 seats.
	   About 100 seats remained to be counted.
	   Results released late Sunday and published in Nigerian
newspapers also showed the PDP's winning 337 seats compared with
130 for the APP and 70 for the AD. No vote percentages were
released and it remains unclear how many people voted in this
country of more than 100 million people, although turnout was high
and 50 million were registered for the ballot.
	   The PDP was formed earlier this year by 34 well known academics,
politicians, tribal leaders and former military generals who
opposed Abacha's autocratic rule. Its presidential hopefuls include
former military ruler Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo.
	   Observers say those voting for the PDP were hoping for consensus
between the army and civilian society. Military meddling and armed
coups have long been part of Nigerian politics _ the army has held
power for all but 10 years since independence in 1960.
	   While nine parties hope to attain the presidency, only those
with at least five percent of the vote in two-thirds of the country
can nominate candidates.
	   As a result, only the top three parties from Saturday's poll
seem likely to qualify.
	   Obasanjo has donated dlrs 2.5 million and is campaigning for the
PDP's presidential nomination. The party, however, lost all seats
in Obasanjo's hometown of Abeokuta.
	   Obasanjo remained unfazed. ``The final outcome will prove that
the PDP is the platform preferred by most Nigerians,'' he told
reporters Sunday evening.
	   In some remote rural communities, votes were collected by
donkeys and camels, while polling stations in the major cities had
to deal with a higher-than-expected turnout and a shortage of
officials and materials.
	   Several Lagos newspapers on Monday reported that as many as 14
people were killed Saturday in election-related clashes, giving no
details. At least one running battle between rival party supporters
occurred at a polling station outside Warri, about 200 kilometers
(125 miles) southeast of Lagos, resulting in six deaths.
	   U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley on Sunday praised the
elections as a sign that Nigerians are willing to bring about
serious reforms.
	   Abubakar met Daley and a delegation of senior U.S. executives at
his state residence in the capital, Abuja.
	   ``Democracy is here to stay, and it will stay,'' Abubakar said.

Angolan rebel group says gov't army still attacking, 10 dead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Government jets Monday bombarded the
central highland strongholds of the rebel group UNITA for the
fourth consecutive day, while infantry units supported by tanks
advanced on the towns by road, a UNITA spokesman said.
	   UNITA Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba Gato said at least 10
people were killed and about 50 were injured in the attacks which
appeared to mark an end to the southwest African country's fragile
four-year-old peace process.
	   The government has refused to say whether it is attacking the
rebel bases. However, the Defense Ministry will not allow reporters
into the area because it says it is an ``operational zone.''
	   United Nations staff in the area last week reported hearing bomb
explosions.
	   Gato said MiG jets launched two strikes early Monday on Andulo
and Bailundo, rural towns about 290 kilometers (180 miles)
southeast of Luanda where the UNITA leadership lives.
	   UNITA troops supported by local militias had repelled a
government attack by road on Andulo while fighting around Bailundo,
150 kilometers (93 miles) to the west, was deadlocked, according to
Gato.
	   Gato, speaking by satellite telephone, said he was in Bailundo,
though it was not possible to confirm that.
	   The government and UNITA have engaged in skirmishes in rural
areas of this vast country in recent months, although both sides
refuse to admit responsibility for ending the peace accord.
	   Gato said UNITA still wanted to find a peaceful solution to the
conflict but accused President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who leads
the governing MPLA Party, of wanting to crush the group.
	   ``The peace agreement has effectively been buried by Dos Santos.
He has implicitly ended it,'' Gato said.
	   ``But we'll keep fighting back. There'll be no winner,'' he
said.
	   The 1994 U.N.-brokered peace pact, which ended a two-decade
civil war between the foes, has not advanced since June.
	   The government accuses UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ of keeping a
30,000-strong guerilla army hidden in the jungle.
	   UNITA has refused to relinquish control of its two last
strongholds, claiming that the government has committed human
rights abuses in areas already handed over.
	   A 1991 peace agreement collapsed the following year after UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi rejected his defeat in the country's first
democratic elections which were won by Dos Santos and his Popular
Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or MPLA.

Former East German sports doctor fined for giving steroids
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ In the largest penalty yet against a former
communist sports official, a court fined a former East German
sports doctor 14,000 marks (dlrs 8,200) Monday for giving athletes
steroids without their knowledge.
	   Bernd Pansold, 59, was the last of six defendants accused of
carrying out systematic doping policies under a state-sponsored
program that won dozens of gold medals for the former communist
East at the Olympics and other championships.
	   The defendants _ two doctors and four coaches _ were charged
with causing bodily harm to 19 young swimmers by giving them
anabolic steroids without informing them or their parents. The
women suffer from such problems as unnatural body hair, excessive
muscle growth, voice changes or severe acne, according to
prosecutors.
	   Pansold had denied the charges, but the court found him guilty
of administering performance-enhancing drugs from 1975-1984 even
though he knew they were dangerous.
	   An earlier defendant, former sports doctor Dieter Binus, had
confessed to handing out steroids and said that Pansold was
responsible for deciding which Olympic candidates were to receive
the so-called ``supporting means.''
	   The two doctors, as well as the other defendants, were employed
by Dynamo Berlin, an East Berlin swim club closely associated with
the communist security apparatus. Their nine-month trial was
expected to be only the first prosecution of former East German
sports officials.
	   The other defendants _ Binus and former coaches Rolf Glaeser,
Volker Frischke, Dieter Lindemann and Dieter Krause, received fines
ranging from 9,000 marks (dlrs 5,300) to 3,000 marks (dlrs 1,760).

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Five supporters of Glasgow Rangers, en route
to Parma for the Scottish club's UEFA Cup match, were arrested
after a drunken rampage through the streets of Milan, the ANSA news
agency reported Monday.
	   The five men were picked up after breaking windows of a
restaurant and shop, and damaging about 30 cars.
	   ANSA said the men were all from Edinborough and between the ages
of 25 and 35.
	   Milan police would not comment on the report.
	   Rangers plays at Parma on Tuesday night for a spot in the UEFA
Cup quarterfinals. The clubs drew 1-1 in the first leg two weeks

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, reflecting
growing Israeli unease over U.S. President Bill Clinton's upcoming
visit, suggested Monday that the trip was entirely at the
initiative of the American leader.
	   ``What am I going to tell him, not to come _ don't come? I can
prevent him from coming?'' Netanyahu asked rhetorically in an
interview on army radio. ``We're not accustomed to refusing someone
who wants to come.''
	   In another sign of tensions arising from the trip, the speaker
of Israel's parliament, Dan Tichon, said he intended to boycott
Clinton-connected events to protest the fact that the president did
not plan to address the Knesset.
	   Clinton's visit to Israel, which begins Saturday, is to be
coupled with a stop in the Gaza Strip, the first by a sitting U.S.
president.
	   The United States has repeatedly said the trip is not intended
as an endorsement of Palestinian statehood aspirations, but the
Palestinians see it as a powerful boost to their sovereignty hopes.
	   On Monday, speaking to reporters in Gaza, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat hailed the upcoming trip as ``historical and great.''
	   The presidential visit to Israel and the Palestinian lands is
meant to encourage both sides to stick to the timetable set out in
the Wye River accords signed in October.
	   Netanyahu said Clinton's trip ``has value only if he strengthens
the Palestinian fulfillment of their obligations'' under the
agreement.
	   He continued to deny U.S. administration claims that he had
initiated Clinton's visit _ but insisted that Clinton would
nonetheless be received warmly
	   In recent weeks, Israel and the Palestinians have accused one
another of failing to live up to various provisions, and Israel has
threatened to hold off on a scheduled Dec. 18 troop pullback.
	   Palestinians, for their part, are angry over stepped-up Jewish
settlement activity in the West Bank and Israel's failure to free
hundreds of so-called security prisoners, jailed for anti-Israel
activity.
	   Israel released the first 250 of a promised 750 Palestinian
prisoners last month, but they were mainly criminals, not security
prisoners as the Palestinians have demanded.
	   In response, Palestinians have been staging protests that have
repeatedly boiled over into violent street clashes.
	   More clashes with between protesters and Israeli and Palestinian
troops took place Monday in several West Bank towns. Palestinians
ambushed cars with stones near Jerusalem. A civilian opened fire,
injuring two of the protesters _ one critically.

Schroeder's much-discussed job talks open Monday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Closing news conference expected at 1700 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Quarreling between unions and employers
dampened expectations Monday going into critical government talks
aimed at keeping Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's promise to put 4
million Germans back to work.
	   Schroeder will personally lead the talks among labor, employers
and political leaders in an important test of his newly elected
government and of his key strategy to reduce unemployment, now at
10.1 percent.
	   Both unions and employers ignored Labor Minister Walter
Riester's call to come to the talks ``without conditions and
demands.'' Riester will present a plan to put 100,000 young,
first-time job-seekers to work.
	   As squabbles broke out among the negotiating parties, Schroeder
warned against high expectations for the first round. A second
round will be held in February.
	   Germany's largest employers group, the German Industry
Association insisted that wage issues must be part of the
discussions. Employers have balked at recent union demands to raise
wages by as much as 6.5 percent as counterproductive to the goal of
jobs' creation.
	   Dieter Schulte of the Federation of German Unions rejected the
proposal as an attempt to limit raises. ``Working families need
more money in their pockets,'' he was quoted Monday as saying in
the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
	   Another point of controversy are union demands to lower the
retirement age to 60 to create jobs for younger people.
	   Both sides, however, showed a willingness to compromise on
overtime and part-time jobs. And Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine
threatened to introduce legislation limiting overtime if the sides
don't reach an agreement on the point.
	   ``Less overtime and more part-time jobs make sense and could
quickly create jobs for many people,'' said Schulte, of the
Federation of German Unions.
	   Schroeder, five cabinet ministers and nine representatives of
German industrial groups and unions will participate in the first
round of talks, expected to last three hours.
	   Union representatives also were cautiously optimistic, mindful
that the previous government, led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, tried
to get the three sides to cooperate for job creation without
success.
	   ``If Alliance for Jobs doesn't work this time, the idea will be
dead,'' said Schulte.
	   Not invited to Monday's session were medium-sized businesses,
those with no more than 500 workers and annual sales up to 100
million marks (dlrs 59 million). This was a disappointment, group
chief Mario Ohoven said, considering that Germany's medium-sized
businesses employ 25 million workers.
	   Other employee groups at the talks will include the German
Chamber of Industry and Commerce, the craftsmen's association and
the employers association. On the union side: IG Metall; the
chemical workers' IG Chemie; the public sector union OeTV; and the
employees' union DAG.

Iraq says cooperation with inspectors won't go on ``too long''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will not cooperate with U.N.
inspectors for ``too long'' and will refuse further delays in
completing their disarmament activities in the country, Vice
President Taha Yassin Ramadan said Monday.
	   Addressing about 80 Jordanian officials and politicians at a
pro-Iraq conference, Ramadan also made clear that Iraq will not
remain idle if a promised review of its progress in disarmament
does not eventually lead to a lifting of sanctions.
	   The inspectors returned to Iraq on November 14 after an almost
three week halt in their activities. Iraq had cut cooperation with
the U.N. Special Commission, assigned to disarm the country under
U.N. resolutions, and only relented when the United States and
Britain were about to unleash air strikes to force compliance.
	   Ramadan said Iraq's decision to have the inspectors back ``did
not solve the crisis but merely deferred it.''
	   He said although the specter of U.S. and British military
strikes remained, Iraq would not change its demand to have the
sanctions removed.
	   ``UNSCOM has limited opportunity. We have our own principles
which we have made public. Any violation of its mandate will be
rejected by Iraq,'' Ramadan said.
	   He said he was not setting ``a time ceiling'' for UNSCOM to
finish its work but warned Iraq's patience this time will continue
``within a time that is not too long.''
	   The sanctions, imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990, will
not be lifted until the inspectors certify that Baghdad has
scrapped its nuclear, biological and chemical weapons along with
the long-range missiles to deliver them.
	   Ramadan said Iraq was waiting for UNSCOM's chairman Richard
Butler to announce that Baghdad was cooperating with his commission
so that a comprehensive review on its disarmament efforts will
start in the Security Council.
	   ``Just a review is not what we want. It should have an aim and
lead to a result,'' Ramadan said.
	   Ramdan said Iraq was certain that the United States would not
allow any lifting of sanctions even if UNSCOM gave it a clean bill
of health because the American aim is to topple President Saddam
Hussein.
	   He said that therefore the winner ``in all battles with
America'' is Saddam because he remains in power.
	   Ramadan said Iraq is not as angry with Washington as it is with
``some Arab rulers who are more keen to eliminate the regime than
both America and Britain.''
	   Ramadan's tough remarks on Arab rulers contrasted with those in
a front-page editorial in the ruling Baath Party newspaper
al-Thawra, which urged members of the Gulf Cooperation Council
meeting in Abu Dhabi to turn a new page with Iraq.

Contested elephants get export approval for Germany, Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A judge on Monday approved the
export of seven baby elephants to Germany and Switzerland after
ruling last week they were abused and deprived of water.
	   But it's not clear if Germany wants them.
	   The August capture of 30 young elephants _ including the seven
destined for Europe _ has ignited outrage among some international
conservation groups, who say it was cruel to snatch them from their
family groups in Botswana.
	   An animal rights activist said that Germany's environmental
officials had withdrawn an import permit for the seven animals.
	   ``Germany has suspended its permit. They issued it last week and
suspended it on Friday,'' said Jane Garrison, an American from the
animal rights group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
	   Garrison organized a protest against the export at the German
embassy in Pretoria on Monday.
	   A German embassy official said she would comment on the permit
issue later Monday.
	   After a six-week court battle in the small town of Brits, near
Pretoria, Glas last Wednesday ruled that the 30 young elephants
were being cruelly treated. He granted temporary custody to the
National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
	   Riccardo Ghiazza, who owns the animals through his company,
African Game Services, asked the judge on Monday to allow the
export of the seven elephants.
	   The NSPCA agreed on the condition that the zoos be informed
about behavior problems expected to emerge in the elephants because
of their alleged abuse at Ghiazza's farm.
	   Experts testified during the court case that the elephants were
prodded with sharp sticks until they bled, that the wounds became
infected and that the animals were deprived of food and water.
	   They said elephants trained in this way are likely to attack or
even kill humans.
	   ``In principle we have a problem with zoos,'' said Marcelle
French, executive director of the NSPCA. ``But the fact that they
are out of Ghiazza's backyard is in their favor.''
	   The export is to take place before Dec. 16, according to
Monday's court agreement.
	   Zoos in Erfurt and Dresden are each taking two animals. Basel
Zoo has ordered three elephants, the court heard.
	   Ghiazza has argued that he is saving the elephants from certain
death in the wild, where they face drought and overpopulation in
southern Africa.
	   The attorney general is considering filing criminal charges
against Ghiazza for cruelty to animals.
	   Ghiazza is appealing Glas's custody ruling in the Pretoria High
Court.

Britain offers Libya diplomatic presence in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Cook quotes Monday; shortens pvs &QL; 
 &UR; With Gulf-Libya &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain, which severed diplomatic relations with
Libya in 1984, said Monday that Libya can appoint diplomatic
representatives in Scotland if two Libyans are convicted in the
bombing of a Pan Am jet.
	   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, in an interview with Radio
Scotland, made the offer as part of attempts to get Libya to accept
that _ if convicted _ the two suspects must be jailed in Scotland.
	   Cook said Libya was clearly serious about the U.S-British
proposal for Scottish judges to try the men at a special court in
the Netherlands, and the jail issue was the sole sticking point.
	   ``... In all justice and reason, I see no reason why they should
serve their sentences anywhere else other than where the crime was
committed,'' said Cook.
	   The New York-bound Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over the Scottish
town of Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people.
	   U.N. Secretary-general Kofi Annan met with Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi on Saturday in a new effort to try to persuade him to hand
over the suspects, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah.
	   Britain severed relations with Libya after a London policewoman
was shot dead outside the Libyan embassy. A Libyan interests
section operates out of the Saudi Embassy.
	   Cook said Libya had been assured that diplomatic representatives
could have access to the men in Scotland throughout the long
sentences they would receive if convicted. International observers
could also monitor their jail conditions in Scotland.
	   Relatives could visit the suspects during the trial, and defense
lawyers would be given the full evidence against the men, Cook
added.
	   Annan was in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, on Monday
for a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
	   The head of the Arab League, Esmat Abdel-Meguid said after
meeting Annan that league is ready to help by giving guarantees to
our Arab brothers.'' He did not elaborate.
	   On Sunday, state-run Libyan Radio quoted an unidentified
official in the Foreign Liaison Secretariat, Libya's equivalent of
a foreign ministry, as saying that ``a solution to this crisis is
within reach.''

Yeltsin fires key aides during a brief visit from hospital

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Briefly returning to work with a bang, President
Boris Yeltsin fired several top aides Monday and assumed personal
control of two key government agencies during a surprise foray into
the Kremlin.
	   After just three hours at his office, Yeltsin returned to the
government hospital where he has been for the past two weeks. The
Kremlin shakeup removed four top aides, some of whom had publicly
questioned the president's health in recent weeks.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin was quoted by
presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin as telling the aides.
	   Yeltsin's actions showed that the ailing president still has
authority, but did not directly address serious problems such as
the country's economic crisis.
	   The president has said almost nothing about the deepening
economic problems, yet he remains extremely sensitive to any
suggestions that he's not fit to govern.
	   The president's decision to begin overseeing the Justice
Ministry and tax police was seen as mostly symbolic, since the
actual heads of those organizations will stay in place.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin will remain in the hospital as long as
necessary to fully recuperate from pneumonia, Yakushkin said. He
refused to say when Yeltsin will be released, adding that it would
depend on the treatment.
	   Yeltsin dismissed Chief of Staff Valentin Yumashev and his
deputies Yuri Yarov, Mikhail Komissar and Yevgeny Savostyanov.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff, while the
other posts remain vacant. Bordyuzha, who will serve in both posts,
was chief of the Border Guards before his appointment to the
security post earlier this year.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin had dismissed the aides because of their
failure to stem crime or respond to several incidents of political
extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist deputy in
the Russian parliament.
	   ``That undermines confidence in the president and in the
government as a whole, and that is inadmissible in the current
difficult economic situation,'' the spokesman said.
	   Yeltsin has a habit of unexpected and often unexplained
dismissals. The latest round of ousters was also thought to reflect
his unhappiness over the aides' unusual candidness about his health
in recent weeks.
	   Yumashev and other Kremlin aides openly said that Yeltsin is too
weak to handle day-to-day affairs or to make foreign trips and
suggested he leave control of the economy and other current affairs
to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   The Russian media has said that the aides were further eroding
Yeltsin's power. The dismissed aides handled the president's
schedule and other workings in the Kremlin and had considerable
influence.
	   ``The president wanted to show who is the boss,'' said Alexander
Shokhin, the head of the moderate, pro-government faction, Our Home
Is Russia. ``He's like a lion who licked his wounds and now roared
at those who thought he was already out of the game.''
	   Ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky praised the president for
cleaning the Kremlin of what he described as corrupt, weak
``slime,'' while Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov added his support.
	   Communists have long assailed the Yeltsin aides, but the No. 2
in the Communist Party hierarchy, Valentin Kuptsov, criticized
Yeltsin anyway.
	   ``After every illness or holiday of the president we always
expect inexplicable personnel reshuffling,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin's decision to become more involved in the Justice
Ministry appeared aimed at stepping up the fight against endemic
corruption and other crime, Yakushkin said.
	   A top democratic lawmaker, Galina Starovoitova, was murdered
last month in St. Petersburg in an apparent contract killing. Her
unexplained death outraged and shocked many Russians.
	   Yeltsin all but disappeared from sight when he entered a
government hospital Nov. 22 with pneumonia, the latest in a long
string of health problems in recent years for the Russian leader.
	   Many of Yeltsin's opponents claim he hasn't been seriously
involved in national affairs for a long time and is no longer fit
to lead.
	   Despite calls for his resignation, Yeltsin and his doctors
insist that the president will serve out his term, which ends in
2000.

Official: IMF, World Bank delay aid to Ukraine over stalled
</HEADLINE>
reforms &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine will not get new loan installments
from the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank until it
approves a 1999 budget and introduces a series of reforms, a senior
official said Monday.
	   The IMF postponed the latest tranche of a dlrs 2.2 billion loan,
slated for release in September, because of the government's poor
tax collection and sluggish reforms in key sectors of the economy,
including energy and agriculture.
	   An IMF delegation visited Kiev last week and urged the
government to work harder on administrative and tax reforms issues
to qualify for the fund's aid, presidential adviser Valery
Lytvytsky said.
	   The loan was approved in September but Ukraine has seen only
dlrs 335 million of it so far.
	   He said the IMF would send another delegation to Ukraine next
month to evaluate the government's reform progress and analyze the
new 1999 budget in order to decide on whether to continue providing
its aid.
	   ``Approval of a realistic 1999 budget is a primary task,''
without which Ukraine can hardly hope for further disbursement of
the IMF loan, Lytvytsky said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Parliament postponed debate of the 1999 budget draft last week
after saying the government's revenue projections were too high,
and is scheduled to discuss the document again Wednesday.
	   The delay also automatically put off further disbursement of the
World Bank's own aid package _ which depends on the IMF's positive
assessment of the Ukrainian government's reform policies.
	   The World Bank approved its dlrs 950 million in loans to Ukraine
following approval of the IMF loan, and has already provided dlrs
340 million.
	   World Bank regional director Paul Siegelbaum told a news
conference in Kiev on Monday that the World Bank might even cut its
cooperation with Ukraine in the future if the former Soviet
republic's leftist-leaning legislature continues to obstruct
introduction of bank-developed projects.
	   Several such projects already have been suspended because
parliament failed to ratify them.
	   Ukraine badly needs foreign loans to replenish its hard currency
reserves, now at around dlrs 1 billion, so it can pay off
obligations on debt in 1999.
	   Government officials have acknowledged that Ukraine does not
have reliable sources of foreign aid for 1999 except for the IMF
and the World Bank because foreign investors have largely fled the
region following Russia's economic crisis, which struck in
mid-August.

massacre of thousands of Muslims _ today denied genocide charges.
	   At his arraignment before the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, Gen.
Radislav Krstic also pleaded innocent to crimes against humanity
and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions.
	   ``I plead not guilty,'' Krstic, 50, said calmly and clearly as
each charge was read.
	   Krstic, arrested last week by U.S. members of the NATO
peacekeeping force in Bosnia, is the most senior Serb military
officer to be tried for atrocities during the Bosnian war.
	   A trial date was not immediately set for Krstic, who is being
held in the U.N. court's high-security cell block outside The
Hague. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment.
	   Krstic was allowed to remain seated as he entered his pleas. His
lawyer, Nenad Petrusic, told presiding Judge Claude Jorda of France
that Krstic was suffering from serious injuries that made it
difficult for him to stand. Krstic reportedly lost part of his
right leg after stepping on a mine in 1994.
	   The indictment alleges offenses that followed the Serb takeover
of the U.N. ``safe haven'' of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia in July
1995. Prosecutor Brenda Hollis said she would likely call between
50 and 70 witnesses at the trial, which is expected to last for
months.
	   The indictment says forces under Krstic and Bosnian Serb wartime
military chief Gen. Ratko Mladic ``either expelled or killed'' most
members of the enclave's Bosnian Muslim population.
	   Krstic planned and assisted in the ``preparation or execution of
a planned and organized mass execution of thousands of captured
Bosnian Muslim men.'' The indictment was issued in October but made
public only last week so Krstic would not flee.
	   The widescale killings allegedly occurred in several locations
in and around the enclave, including a warehouse and schools.
	   Soldiers under Krstic's command used heavy equipment to bury the
victims in mass graves. When the international community learned of
the killings, Krstic and his units dug up the bodies and
transferred them to other graves, the indictment alleges.
	   Krstic is believed to be a close associate of Mladic and former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, the tribunal's top two
suspects. Both have been indicted for the massacres at Srebrenica;
both remain at large.
	   The tribunal was established in 1993 by the U.N. Security
Council to prosecute genocide and war crimes stemming from the
clashes in the former Yugoslavia.

Runoffs needed for most seats in St. Petersburg elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DMITRY LOVETSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Most local seats up for grabs in
Russia's second largest city were still undecided today after an
election marred by bomb threats and complaints of voter fraud.
	   Officials said today that only six of 50 seats were decided in
Sunday's election for the St. Petersburg legislative assembly. The
rest will have runoffs Dec. 20.
	   The six seats were all held by incumbent deputies. Candidates
must get more than 50 percent of the vote to win in the first
round. The top two vote winners face each other in a second round.
	   Liberals took a prominent lead in the first round, with 22
members of the liberal Yabloko party and nine people from other
reform-minded parties still in the race.
	   Ten communists, as well as the city's former police chief, a
movie actress and the author of a tell-all book about the former
mayor of St. Petersburg are also still in the running.
	   Observers were eager to see how the elections would reflect
public reaction to rising crime in St. Petersburg, especially the
Nov. 20 killing of Galina Starovoitova, a lawmaker in the Russian
parliament.
	   Starovoitova supporters speculated she was killed so that her
faction, Northern Capital, would fare poorly in the election. Her
slaying, however, may have had the opposite effect.
	   In addition, a legislative aide, a high-ranking city official
and a prominent banker have been slain in the last two months.
	   The elections were marred by violence, racial slurs against
Jewish candidates and complaints of ballot box stuffing. The City
Electoral Commission also reported complaints of voter bribery, and
bomb threats forced the temporary closure of three stations.
	   Still, voter turnout was high by current Russian standards _
around 40 percent.

Russian ruble plunges further, World Bank team arrives for talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW grafs 5-9 with Russian delegation to discuss debt
rescheduling with Paris Club, inflation estimates for 1999, other
details, ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A World Bank team arrived in Moscow for more loan
talks Monday as the battered Russian ruble resumed its slide,
heading toward a new low since the financial crisis hit in August.
	   The World Bank team was to reconsider the terms of a earlier
promised dlrs 1.5 billion loan for structural reform, as well as a
dlrs 800 million social reform credit and a dlrs 800 million loan
to streamline the ailing coal industry, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The team will make recommendations to the World Bank board of
directors later this month, when it discusses its plans for Russia.
	   The loans are part of an IMF-led dlrs 22.6 billion bailout
package that was agreed upon before economic crisis forced the
government to devalue the ruble and default on some debts in
August.
	   Russia is also seeking to reschedule at least a portion of dlrs
17.5 billion in foreign debt payments due next year. A government
delegation will leave for talks on debt rescheduling with the Paris
Club of creditor nations on Dec. 9, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported Monday.
	   Meanwhile, the ruble plunged again in trading Monday, hitting
20.4 to the dollar, down 0.8 rubles from Friday.
	   The ruble sold for more than 20 to the dollar for a couple of
days shortly after the country's economic crisis hit in mid-August
before making a mild comeback. The ruble was at about 6 to the
dollar before the crisis.
	   With Russian financial markets virtually wiped out by the
crisis, the ruble has become the main indicator of economic
confidence. Its fall reflects fears that the government will flood
the economy with a lot of new cash to pay its huge debts _ a move
that is certain to trigger high inflation.
	   The Russian government wants to keep inflation at 30 percent
next year, but the Central Bank conceded that ``certain
conditions'' may push the inflation to up to 55 percent, Interfax
reported.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet has said it may have
to print large amounts of money if international lenders, including
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, don't release
the loan package agreed last summer and put on hold after the
crisis hit.
	   In talks last week, the IMF urged Russia to provide a realistic
budget for next year as a key condition for resuming loans, but
showed no sign that it would free the money any time soon.
	   Until the IMF acts, other foreign lenders are unlikely to give
Russia the infusion of cash it needs to pay workers, pensioners and
foreign creditors.

EU ministers demand more guarantees on Russia aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union foreign ministers Monday
delayed endorsing a dlrs 460 million food aid deal for Russia,
saying they need more guarantees the aid will reach the needy, not
profiteers.
	   The ministers said they wanted to see more independent control
over the distribution of hundreds of millions of tons of grain,
beef, milk powder and other foodstuffs.
	   ``In principle we are in favor of giving aid, but a multitude of
questions needs to be answered first,'' said German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer.
	   The food aid plan, drawn up by the EU's executive Commission,
was sent back for further study by EU farm ministers who next meet
Dec. 14.
	   The delay dampens hopes EU leaders would announce approval of
the aid at their year-end summit this week in Vienna, Austria. The
summit is expected to holder a wider debate on relations between
Russia and the 15-nation European bloc.
	   ``We need to so this is in a more sensible way. We cannot simply
decide in one afternoon to take some food to Russia,'' Dutch
Foreign Minister Jozais van Aartsen.
	   The EU has been debating the aid package since Nov. 9, four days
after the United States announced it would provide Russia with a
dlrs 600 million food aid package.
	   Russia's worst grain harvest in 40 years, coming on the heels of
the summer's financial collapse have sent prices rising 50 percent
and prompted fears the poor won't be able to afford food through
the winter.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh said Monday that
his country wants the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
to reduce production by at least an additional 1.5 million barrels
per day, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   He insisted that Iran has observed cuts agreed to earlier this
year.
	   OPEC and non-OPEC members last June pledged to remove 3.1
million barrels of crude a day from the glutted market. Prices,
however, remain in the doldrums because of a glut on the world
market and recession in Asia.
	   Iran is OPEC's second-largest producer after Saudi Arabia. It
agreed to cut 305,000 barrels, bringing its daily output down to
3.318 million barrels.
 &UR; ___
	   MUSCAT, Oman (AP) _ Oman does not plan to join the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the official Omani News Agency on
Monday quoted the oil minister as saying.
	   But the minister, Mohammed bin Hamed al-Rumhi, said the country
was willing to work with OPEC to try to stem the fall in prices,
the agency said.
	   ``Oman is ready to cooperate with OPEC in finding solutions to
the fall in international oil prices,'' the agency quoted al-Rumhi
as saying.
	   News reports quoted OPEC secretary-general Rilwanu Lukman as
saying Sunday at an economic conference in Oman that non-OPEC
countries Russia, Oman and Mexico are planning to join the
13-nation oil cartel.
	   Lukman said that their participation would help stabilize world
oil prices, according to the report by the Kuwait News Agency.
	   Although Oman does not belong to OPEC, it has largely followed
the cartel's policies. It also attended the group's recent meetings
as an observer.
	   Oman currently produces 870,000 barrels per day following a cut
of 50,000 barrels in line with an OPEC-brokered agreement earlier
this year.
	   OPEC members are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Qatar, United Arab
Emirates, Algeria, Nigeria, Iraq, Libya, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia
and Venezuela.
 &UR; ___
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt and Turkey will discuss building a
pipeline under the Mediterranean Sea to carry Egyptian natural gas
to Turkey, Oil Minister Hamdy el-Banbi was quoted Monday as saying.
	   The Egyptian daily Al-Ahram quoted el-Banbi as saying the
proposed 1,200 kilometer (750 mile) pipeline initially would carry
5 billion cubic meters (175 billion cubic feet) of natural gas a
year to Turkey, with the figure doubling in later years.
	   He said the pipeline would take three years to build. He gave no
details about financing.
	   The two countries first discussed the project in late 1996 and
signed a memorandum of understanding last June.
	   El-Banbi said Egypt's reserves of the natural gas were estimated
at 1.08 trillion cubic meters (36 trillion cubic feet) in 1998,
enough to supply the country's needs and allow for exports.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ U.S. Ambassador James Larocco advised Kuwait to
diversify its economy and not to assume that oil prices will
rebound, even by the first decade of the new century.
	   ``A diversified Kuwaiti economy can cushion the blow when oil
prices are low, while providing opportunities for capital right
here in Kuwait when prices are up,'' the ambassador said in a
speech Sunday night. The embassy on Monday provided a copy of the
speech, which was delivered at the Society of Petroleum Engineers.
	   Low world oil prices have set back Kuwait's economy. The budget
deficit for the current fiscal year, which began July 1, could be
more than 1.92 billion dinars (dlrs 6.35 billion).
	   ``Kuwait runs a risk in assuming that oil prices will rebound
next year, the year after, or even well into the first decade of
the new century,'' Larocco said.
	   He said that diversifying the economy was ``an insurance policy
that pays dividends in good years and bad.''

Clashes over prisoners continue; hunger strikes expands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two Palestinians injured, one critically &QL; 
 &UR; By DANA BUDEIRI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Clashes over the release of
Palestinian prisoners spread throughout the West Bank Monday, and a
prisoners' group said its hunger strike would continue until Israel
releases all its Palestinian prisoners.
	   The Palestinian Prisoners Association urged Palestinians to
stage an ``intefadeh'' _ or uprising _ until all Palestinian
prisoners are released, Palestinian legislator Fares Kadoura told
protesters in the Palestinian-controlled town of Ramallah.
	   ``The Palestinians in Israeli jails announce that our revolution
has started,'' Kadoura said, reading from a statement.
	   Israel released 250 Palestinian prisoners last month out of 750
promised it the U.S.-brokered Wye River accords, signed in October.
	   Palestinians are angry that most of those released were accused
of common crimes and want Israel to release ``security prisoners''
_ those detained without trial under prevention of terror measures.
	   Kadoura, who is a member of the team negotiating the prisoners
release with Israel, said that a hunger strike begun last week by
hundreds of prisoners had now spread to all four Israeli jails and
among all 3,000 Palestinian prisoners.
	   Prisons Authority spokeswoman Orit Messer-Harel said she knew of
only 514 prisoners striking at two prisons since Friday. There had
been no health problems so far, she said.
	   Israel would not heed the protests, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said.
	   ``They want to impose on Israel to release murderers,'' he said
on a tour of an archaeological dig in Jerusalem's Old City. ``I
don't free murderers.''
	   He did not address demands for the release of others not accused
of being involved in killings, including members of banned militant
groups.
	   In recent weeks, Israel and the Palestinians have accused one
another of failing to live up to various provisions, and Israel has
threatened to hold off on a scheduled Dec. 18 troop pullback. That
could poison next week's planned visit to the region.
	   Clashes took place in at least five West Bank locations,
including some controlled by the Palestinian Authority. Most
injuries were minor.
	   Stone-throwing protesters ambushed Israeli vehicles in Abu Dis,
a village east of Jerusalem. One Israeli in a pick-up truck fired
on the protesters, wounding two of them.
	   Nasr Erekat, 17, was critically injured from head wounds,
hospital officials said. Another Palestinian was injured in the
thigh.

Guilty verdict in murder of British mother, daughter, in SAfrica
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo file photo available &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A judge on Monday found five men
guilty of murdering a British woman and her four-year-old daughter
in 1996 while they stayed with a friend on a remote farm.
	   The ``Flower Gang'' attacked the farm where Julia Fairbank-Smith
and her daughter Emmma were staying with a friend, who was also
killed.
	   Dawid Ruiters, who was the leader, and Andre Solomons, Johannes
Bruintjies, Charles Adams and Laston Chavula sat sullen faced as
the verdict was read out to a court room packed with heavily armed
police.
	   Fairbank-Smith was originally from Britain, but had moved to
South Africa and lived in Cape Town.
	   Another guest, policeman Johan Viviers, survived the assault. He
woke up with a knife still lodged in his throat and staggered to
get help. Later in the trial, his evidence and identification of
the killers was to prove vital in securing a conviction.
	   The murders, reminiscent of those usually associated with big
cities, shocked the tiny farming community of Nieuwoudtville in the
rural Northern Cape region.
	   After delivering his verdict, Judge Braam Lategan adjourned
court until Tuesday when lawyers for both sides will submit
arguments for determining the length of sentence passed on the gang
members.
	   Sentencing is expected to take place on Thursday.
	   The gang earned its nickname from the flowers that bloom once a
year each Northern Cape spring, turning the usually arid landscape
into a colorful garden and attracting thousands of tourists.
	   The attack occurred in September, which is spring in the
southern hemisphere.

Another Iranian intellectual disappears, paper says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian writer Mohammed Mokhtari left his
home Thursday and has not been heard of since, adding to a recent
spate of mysterious disappearances, the Zan newspaper reported
Monday.
	   Mokhtari, a poet and member of the Association of Iranian
writers, left to go shopping in the residential suburb in northern
Tehran, Zan said. It said Mokhtari's family searched hospitals,
morgues and police stations but could not find him.
	   The writer's association to which he belongs has written a
letter to authorities asking them to look into his disappearance.
	   Increasingly, hard-line rivals of President Mohammad Khatami are
resorting to violence to deal with opponents. Over the past year,
vigilantes have attacked dissidents, liberal newspapers and even a
reformist Cabinet minister.
	   None of the thugs has been arrested, leading to suspicions they
are backed by powerful hard-line clerics like spiritual leader Ali
Khamenei and Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, the head of the judiciary.
	   Last month the head of an Iranian opposition group, Dariush
Foruhar, and his wife Parvaneh were stabbed to death in their home.
	   Police have said they've made several arrests in the murders of
the Foruhars, after President Mohammad Khatami condemned the
killings and ordered an investigation. So far, the findings have
not been made public.

Sequel to last year's Soros vs. Mahathir clash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ It's time for Part II of Malaysia
vs. George Soros.
	   It premiered over the weekend, slightly more than one year after
the first vitriolic show when the international financier was
singled out by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad as the villain
behind Malaysia's economic woes.
	   Now Soros has angered not only Malaysian officials but also some
opposition members of Parliament by favoring Mahathir's
resignation.
	   The sequel started when Soros told a U.S. audience last week
that Malaysians should turn against their prime minister because
his policies are aimed at benefiting himself and his cronies.
	   ``I think what needs to happen is he (Mahathir) needs to be
removed from power,'' Soros said at the Johns Hopkins University.
	   On Monday, when an opposition legislator asked a question about
Soros' remarks in Parliament, a government minister called Soros a
Jew commenting about a predominantly Muslim nation.
	   ``I'm very disappointed that an MP from an Islamic party does
not believe in a Muslim prime minister and is more inclined to
believe in Soros, a Jew whom we know is always looking for means to
destroy us,'' said Mohd. Nazri Aziz, a minister in Mahathir's
office, according to the national news agency Bernama.
	   Last year, Mahathir villainized Soros, blaming his ``Jewish
agenda'' for Malaysia's turmoil in its financial markets. Mahathir
later denied he had made anti-Semitic remarks.
	   On Monday, major pro-government, English-language papers carried
long articles containing statements against Soros, the 68-year-old
financier and philanthropist who often promotes democracy and open
societies.
	   ``What Soros did to the Asian economies was as cruel as what
Adolf Hitler did in Europe,'' said Sanusi Junid, the chief minister
of the northern state of Kedah, according to the Star newspaper.
	   Another official compared Soros to U.S. Vice President Al Gore,
who criticized Mahathir's government during last month's
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit in Malaysia.
	   ``First it was Al Gore and now it is Soros. Obviously they are
frustrated with our stabilizing economy because this is not what
they want to see,'' said Chan Kong Choy, the junior Cabinet
minister for energy and communications.
	   The remarks worried the Malaysian opposition, who felt it could
become convenient for Mahathir, 72, to band them together with
Soros and Gore as people who were opposed to his 17-year-rule and
thereby weaken the opposition's struggle.
	   ``Soros has no understanding of psychology, and he should keep
his mouth shut if he wants to see Dr. Mahathir and (Mahathir's)
Barisan Nasional government toppled,'' said Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat
of Parti Islam SeMalaysia, the only opposition leader to head a
state.
	   The party, together with several liberal opposition groups, is
campaigning for Mahathir's removal in the wake of the public outcry
over the firing and imprisonment of vice prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim in September.
	   Anwar, who started a reform movement to oust Mahathir, is being
tried on charges of illegal sex and corruption. He has accused
Mahathir of firing and falsely accusing him because the prime
minister was threatened by his growing popularity.
	   ``Since we have also been calling for Dr. Mahathir to step down,
it is as if we are bowing to or following the demands of Soros,''
said Nik Abdul Aziz.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Iraq's Tariq Aziz and Russia's foreign minister
said Monday that the Arab nation was again cooperating with U.N.
weapons inspectors and that sanctions relief should be granted
soon.
	   Russia also called for a ``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's
compliance with United Nations resolutions, saying that should help
move the process along.
	   ``We believe that soon the sanctions will be lifted,'' Russia's
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told a news conference after meeting
Aziz. ``We are approaching the end of a long process.''
	   Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, maintains regular ties with
Russia, which is sympathetic to Baghdad and supports the early
lifting of the U.N. sanctions.
	   Despite Ivanov's optimism, there are no signs that the United
States and Britain, the leading proponents of sanctions, are
prepared to ease their stance following repeated showdowns with
Iraq.
	   Iraq agreed to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors
last month after a confrontation that nearly led to military
strikes by the United States.
	   Aziz said he hoped that ``lawful and objective inspections''
could take place next month. And he again criticized the U.N.
Security Council for failing to end the embargo that was placed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``For more than seven years Iraq has been following through on
its obligations, but the Security Council hasn't been meeting its
obligations,'' Aziz said. ``This is unacceptable.''
	   While offering Iraq moral support, Russia has insisted that
Baghdad comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 687, which
calls for the dismantling of all weapons of mass destruction, the
main condition for ending the sanctions.
	   ``We are calling for the full implementation ... which should
lead to the lifting of the oil embargo,'' Ivanov said.
	   Aziz met later in the day with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
	   Primakov, a fluent Arabic speaker who has known Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein for years, has mediated on several occasions when
Iraq and the United Nations were in the midst of a confrontation.
	   Iraq wants the embargo lifted so it can resume exporting oil at
full capacity and rebuild its shattered economy. It is permitted
limited oil exports at present to buy food and medicine.
	   Russia, meanwhile, is owed billions of dollars by Iraq and wants
to help rebuild the country's oil industry when the sanctions are
lifted.
	   However, world oil prices are already sagging due to an oil
glut, and if Iraq increased its exports it could push prices even
lower.

Most seats for St. Petersburg elections go to runoffs

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Most local legislative seats up for
grabs in Russia's second largest city of St. Petersburg will go to
runoffs after an election that was marred by bomb threats and
complaints of voter fraud.
	   Officials said Monday that just six of 50 seats were decided in
Sunday's election for the St. Petersburg legislative assembly,
while the rest will go to runoffs scheduled for December 20.
	   The six seats were all held by incumbent assembly deputies.
Candidates must get more than 50 percent of the vote to win in the
first round or the top two vote winners face each other in a second
round.
	   Liberals took a prominent lead in the first round of voting,
with 22 members of the liberal Yabloko party and nine people from
various other reform-minded parties still in the race.
	   Ten communists, as well as the city's former police chief, a
movie actress and the author of a tell-all book about the former
mayor of St. Petersburg are also still in the running.
	   Observers were eager to see how the elections would reflect
public reaction to rising crime in St. Petersburg, as well as the
Nov. 20 killing of Galina Starovoitova, a member of the Russian
parliament who supported a liberal bloc of candidates in the
elections.
	   Starovoitova supporters speculated she was killed so that her
faction, Northern Capital, would fare poorly in the election. Her
death, however, may have had the opposite effect, rallying liberal
voters.
	   In addition, hitmen have killed a legislative aide, a
high-ranking city official and a prominent banker in the last two
months.
	   Dirty politics in St. Petersburg were reflected in the
elections, which were marred by violence, racial slurs against
Jewish candidates and complaints of ballot box stuffing.
	   The City Electoral Commission also reported complaints of voter
bribery, and bomb threats forced the temporary closure of three
stations.
	   Still, voter turnout was high by Russian standards _ around 40
percent.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. Marine forces have been conducting land
and sea maneuvers for the past week and a half in Israel's Negev
desert, a spokesman said Monday.
	   U.S. embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz said that the training
exercises were routine under U.S.-Israel security agreements,
adding that Israel was one of the few countries in the region that
allowed U.S. Marines to train on its soil.
	   Schwartz said that the Marines were conducting the exercises
alone and that the fleet would return to sea before U.S. President
Bill Clinton's visit to the region Saturday.

NATO foreign ministers to begin forging new strategic concept
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - With the lessons of Bosnia and Kosovo
as a backdrop, NATO foreign ministers begin forging a new strategic
concept Tuesday, moving beyond the traditional tasks of collective
defense to focus on weapons of mass destruction, terrorism and
regional conflicts.
	   This strategic concept, last revised in 1991, sets out the
military and political basis for NATO's mission. In reality,
however, the allies will merely be bringing the theory into line
with what it already has been doing in practice since the fall of
the Berlin wall a decade ago.
	   ``NATO's primary mission will always remain defense against
aggression,'' U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright wrote
Monday in Britain's Financial Times. ``But the founders of the
alliance also distinguished between what the treaty commits us to
do and what it permits us to do.''
	   Today's threat is not a Russian tank assault across the plains
of Central Europe, but security challenges from regional conflicts
and ethnic violence like in Bosnia and Kosovo, terrorism and the
spread of weapons of mass destruction. When these threats originate
from outside NATO's traditional territory of operations, the
alliance must be prepared to deal with them.
	   ``The challenge is to bring the strategy into line with the
changing reality,'' said a senior NATO diplomat briefing reporters
before the NATO foreign ministers' meeting here Tuesday and
Wednesday.
	   The ministers will be making preparations for the NATO summit
April 24-25. Principal among issues at that summit will be approval
of the new strategic concept and the welcoming of three new
members, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, as well as
celebrating the alliance's 50th birthday.
	   Albright will table a proposal at the ministerial meeting here
to set up a Center for Weapons of Mass Destruction, essentially an
intelligence-sharing center to provide greater coherence among the
allies in how this issue is assessed and addressed, officials said.
	   The plan would use existing NATO staff under a single director,
with perhaps a few additional experts, they said.
	   The Germans seem certain to bring up the nuclear first-strike
question.
	   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer made waves when he
called on NATO last month to consider dropping its doctrine
allowing a nuclear first-strike. This doctrine, reaffirmed as
recently as last year, has always been a part of NATO's nuclear
strategy and is considered an important aspect of deterrence.
	   ``The minister will certainly raise the issue,'' a German
diplomatic source said. ``We have to see that in the context of
arms control, arms reduction and nonproliferation.''
	   The Germans don't have much backing on the issue and no one at
NATO sees it as more than a speed bump on the road to the new
strategic concept.
	   The allies will assess the situation in Kosovo, the poor
southern province of Serbia where Serb security forces and ethnic
Albanian guerrillas clashed for seven months. The threat of a NATO
air strike stopped the fighting in October and the cease-fire is
generally holding, despite sporadic outbursts.
	   The ministers also will make their six-monthly review of the
situation in Bosnia. While there may be some cosmetic changes in
the 32,000-member NATO-led force in Bosnia, no major reduction in
the troop level is seen any time soon.
	   ``Bosnia and Kosovo are recent examples that demonstrate NATO
must act when conflicts beyond its immediate borders affect
alliance interests,'' Albright wrote in her Financial Times
article. ``NATO must find the right balance between the centrality
of NATO's collective defense missions and responding to such
crises.''

Yeltsin fires key aides during a brief visit from hospital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin quotes in grafs 9-10, minor editing to
trim. &QL;

 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Briefly returning to work with a bang, President
Boris Yeltsin fired several top aides Monday and assumed personal
control of two key government agencies during a surprise foray into
the Kremlin.
	   After just three hours at his office, Yeltsin returned to the
government hospital where he has been for the past two weeks. The
Kremlin shakeup removed four top aides, some of whom had publicly
questioned the president's health in recent weeks.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin was quoted by
presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin as telling the aides.
	   Yeltsin's actions showed that the ailing president still has
authority, but did not directly address serious problems such as
the country's economic crisis.
	   The president has said almost nothing about the deepening
economic problems, yet he remains extremely sensitive to any
suggestions that he's not fit to govern.
	   The president's decision to begin overseeing the Justice
Ministry and tax police was seen as mostly symbolic, since the
actual heads of those organizations will stay in place.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin will remain in the hospital as long as
necessary to fully recuperate from pneumonia, Yakushkin said. He
refused to say when Yeltsin will be released, adding that it would
depend on the treatment.
	   Yeltsin dismissed Chief of Staff Valentin Yumashev and his
deputies Yuri Yarov, Mikhail Komissar and Yevgeny Savostyanov.
	   ``I expressed gratitude to Yumashev while releasing him of his
duties,'' Yeltsin said in brief footage that was aired on Russian
television.
	   ``Tough discipline, order and reform is what we need,'' Yeltsin
said in a stern voice.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff, while the
other posts remain vacant. Bordyuzha, who will serve in both posts,
was chief of the Border Guards before his appointment to the
security post earlier this year.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin had dismissed the aides because of their
failure to stem crime or respond to several incidents of political
extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist deputy in
the Russian parliament.
	   ``That undermines confidence in the president and in the
government as a whole, and that is inadmissible in the current
difficult economic situation,'' the spokesman said.
	   Yeltsin has a habit of unexpected and often unexplained
dismissals. The latest round of ousters was also thought to reflect
his unhappiness over the aides' unusual candidness about his health
in recent weeks.
	   Yumashev and other Kremlin aides openly said that Yeltsin is too
weak to handle day-to-day affairs or to make foreign trips and
suggested he leave control of the economy and other current affairs
to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   The Russian media has said that the aides were further eroding
Yeltsin's power. The dismissed aides handled the president's
schedule and other workings in the Kremlin and had considerable
influence.
	   ``The president wanted to show who is the boss,'' said Alexander
Shokhin, the head of the moderate, pro-government faction, Our Home
Is Russia. ``He's like a lion who licked his wounds and now roared
at those who thought he was already out of the game.''
	   Ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky praised the president for
cleaning the Kremlin of what he described as corrupt, weak
``slime,'' while Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov added his support.
	   Communists have long assailed the Yeltsin aides, but the No. 2
in the Communist Party hierarchy, Valentin Kuptsov, criticized
Yeltsin anyway.
	   ``After every illness or holiday of the president we always
expect inexplicable personnel reshuffling,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin all but disappeared from sight when he entered a
government hospital Nov. 22 with pneumonia, the latest in a long
string of health problems in recent years for the Russian leader.
	   Many of Yeltsin's opponents claim he hasn't been seriously
involved in national affairs for a long time and is no longer fit
to lead.
	   Despite calls for his resignation, Yeltsin and his doctors
insist that the president will serve out his term, which ends in
2000.

UN rights commissioner: 50th anniversary party is badly needed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The 50th birthday of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights comes none too soon _ because the world needs to be
reminded that the much-ignored document exists, the U.N. human
rights commissioner says.
	   ``We really need a celebration,'' Mary Robinson said in an
interview Monday, before joining President Jacques Chirac to kick
off a weeklong commemoration in the French capital. ``We need to
renew the vision.''
	   Robinson, the former president of Ireland who has been U.N. High
Commissioner of Human Rights for a year, said she was struck by
surveys saying only seven percent of the world knows about the
Declaration, created in the aftermath of Nazi genocide.
	   ``If people know their rights, and know that they belong to them
_ not to states _ it helps them to assert and to claim those
rights,'' she said.
	   But in fact, Robinson said, more people in the world are aware
of the hazards to the environment than the hazards to human rights.
	   ``In terms of awareness, we're about 15 years behind the
environmental lobby,'' she said.
	   Fifty years after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was
inaugurated on Dec. 10, 1948, atrocities persist, in places like
Rwanda and Bosnia, to name just a few. The first priority is to
address those gross violations, Robinson said.
	   The world needs to learn how to address human rights violations
by non-state actors _ paramilitary groups and extremists _ as well
those by states, she said.
	   And just as important is to focus on new areas, such as the
influential role of international corporations, she said.
	   ``Those corporations have immense power,'' she said. ``We need
to show them that human rights is in the business interest of
business.''
	   And then there is poverty _ ``such a terrible violation of so
many human rights,'' Robinson said. ``One of the strengths of the
declaration is that it recognizes economic rights, too.''
	   The weeklong celebration in Paris will draw U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the
Dalai Lama, Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng, and a host of other
dissidents, celebrities, even rock stars.
	   There will be receptions, demonstrations and a concert starring
Alanis Morissette, Peter Gabriel and Tracy Chapman, among others.
	   There already has been one controversy: newspapers reported last
week that Chirac had not included the Dalai Lama on the guest list
for a luncheon Tuesday honoring Nobel laureates, suggesting China
had pressured Chirac.
	   The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader confirmed on Monday that he
had been invited and will be happy to attend.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Briefly returning to work with a bang, President
Boris Yeltsin fired several top aides Monday and assumed personal
control of two key government agencies during a surprise foray into
the Kremlin.
	   After just three hours at his office, Yeltsin returned to the
government hospital where he has been for the past two weeks. The
Kremlin shakeup removed four top aides, some of whom had publicly
questioned the president's health in recent weeks.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin was quoted by
presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin as telling the aides.
	   Yeltsin's actions showed that the ailing president still has
authority, but did not directly address serious problems such as
the country's economic crisis.
	   The president has said almost nothing about the deepening
economic problems, yet he remains extremely sensitive to any
suggestions that he's not fit to govern.
	   The president's decision to begin overseeing the Justice
Ministry and tax police was seen as mostly symbolic, since the
actual heads of those organizations will stay in place.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin will remain in the hospital as long as
necessary to fully recuperate from pneumonia, Yakushkin said. He
refused to say when Yeltsin will be released, adding that it would
depend on the treatment.
	   Yeltsin dismissed Chief of Staff Valentin Yumashev and his
deputies Yuri Yarov, Mikhail Komissar and Yevgeny Savostyanov.
	   ``I expressed gratitude to Yumashev while releasing him of his
duties,'' Yeltsin said in brief footage that was aired on Russian
television.
	   ``Tough discipline, order and reform is what we need,'' Yeltsin
said in a stern voice.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff, while the
other posts remain vacant. Bordyuzha, who will serve in both posts,
was chief of the Border Guards before his appointment to the
security post earlier this year.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin had dismissed the aides because of their
failure to stem crime or respond to several incidents of political
extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist deputy in
the Russian parliament.
	   ``That undermines confidence in the president and in the
government as a whole, and that is inadmissible in the current
difficult economic situation,'' the spokesman said.
	   Yeltsin has a habit of unexpected and often unexplained
dismissals. The latest round of ousters was also thought to reflect
his unhappiness over the aides' unusual candidness about his health
in recent weeks.
	   Yumashev and other Kremlin aides openly said that Yeltsin is too
weak to handle day-to-day affairs or to make foreign trips and
suggested he leave control of the economy and other current affairs
to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   The Russian media has said that the aides were further eroding
Yeltsin's power. The dismissed aides handled the president's
schedule and other workings in the Kremlin and had considerable
influence.
	   ``The president wanted to show who is the boss,'' said Alexander
Shokhin, the head of the moderate, pro-government faction, Our Home
Is Russia. ``He's like a lion who licked his wounds and now roared
at those who thought he was already out of the game.''
	   Ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky praised the president for
cleaning the Kremlin of what he described as corrupt, weak
``slime,'' while Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov added his support.
	   Communists have long assailed the Yeltsin aides, but the No. 2
in the Communist Party hierarchy, Valentin Kuptsov, criticized
Yeltsin anyway.
	   ``After every illness or holiday of the president we always
expect inexplicable personnel reshuffling,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin all but disappeared from sight when he entered a
government hospital Nov. 22 with pneumonia, the latest in a long
string of health problems in recent years for the Russian leader.
	   Many of Yeltsin's opponents claim he hasn't been seriously
involved in national affairs for a long time and is no longer fit
to lead.
	   Despite calls for his resignation, Yeltsin and his doctors
insist that the president will serve out his term, which ends in
2000.

Russia, Iraq claim sanctions against Baghdad could be lifted soon

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Iraq's Tariq Aziz and Russia's foreign minister
said Monday that the Arab nation was again cooperating with U.N.
weapons inspectors and that sanctions relief should be granted
soon.
	   Russia also called for a ``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's
compliance with United Nations resolutions, saying that should help
move the process along.
	   ``We believe that soon the sanctions will be lifted,'' Russia's
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told a news conference after meeting
Aziz. ``We are approaching the end of a long process.''
	   Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, maintains regular ties with
Russia, which is sympathetic to Baghdad and supports the early
lifting of the U.N. sanctions.
	   Despite Ivanov's optimism, there are no signs that the United
States and Britain, the leading proponents of sanctions, are
prepared to ease their stance following repeated showdowns with
Iraq.
	   Iraq agreed to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors
last month after a confrontation that nearly led to military
strikes by the United States.
	   Aziz said he hoped that ``lawful and objective inspections''
could take place next month. And he again criticized the U.N.
Security Council for failing to end the embargo that was placed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``For more than seven years Iraq has been following through on
its obligations, but the Security Council hasn't been meeting its
obligations,'' Aziz said. ``This is unacceptable.''
	   While offering Iraq moral support, Russia has insisted that
Baghdad comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 687, which
calls for the dismantling of all weapons of mass destruction, the
main condition for ending the sanctions.
	   ``We are calling for the full implementation ... which should
lead to the lifting of the oil embargo,'' Ivanov said.
	   Aziz met later in the day with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
	   Primakov, a fluent Arabic speaker who has known Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein for years, has mediated on several occasions when
Iraq and the United Nations were in the midst of a confrontation.
	   Iraq wants the embargo lifted so it can resume exporting oil at
full capacity and rebuild its shattered economy. It is permitted
limited oil exports at present to buy food and medicine.
	   Russia, meanwhile, is owed billions of dollars by Iraq and wants
to help rebuild the country's oil industry when the sanctions are
lifted.
	   However, world oil prices are already sagging due to an oil
glut, and if Iraq increased its exports it could push prices even
lower.

Runoffs needed for most seats in St. Petersburg elections

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Most local seats up for grabs in
Russia's second largest city were still undecided today after an
election marred by bomb threats and complaints of voter fraud.
	   Officials said today that only six of 50 seats were decided in
Sunday's election for the St. Petersburg legislative assembly. The
rest will have runoffs Dec. 20.
	   The six seats were all held by incumbent deputies. Candidates
must get more than 50 percent of the vote to win in the first
round. The top two vote winners face each other in a second round.
	   Liberals took a prominent lead in the first round, with 22
members of the liberal Yabloko party and nine people from other
reform-minded parties still in the race.
	   Ten communists, as well as the city's former police chief, a
movie actress and the author of a tell-all book about the former
mayor of St. Petersburg are also still in the running.
	   Observers were eager to see how the elections would reflect
public reaction to rising crime in St. Petersburg, especially the
Nov. 20 killing of Galina Starovoitova, a lawmaker in the Russian
parliament.
	   Starovoitova supporters speculated she was killed so that her
faction, Northern Capital, would fare poorly in the election. Her
slaying, however, may have had the opposite effect.
	   In addition, a legislative aide, a high-ranking city official
and a prominent banker have been slain in the last two months.
	   The elections were marred by violence, racial slurs against
Jewish candidates and complaints of ballot box stuffing. The City
Electoral Commission also reported complaints of voter bribery, and
bomb threats forced the temporary closure of three stations.
	   Still, voter turnout was high by current Russian standards _
around 40 percent.

Kosovo Albanian negotiator: U.S. plan totally unacceptable
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Serb comment &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. peace efforts in Kosovo
suffered a setback on Monday, with the chief ethnic Albanian
negotiator reportedly rejecting a draft for the future of the
majority ethnic Albanian province of Serbia.
	   Fehmi Agani, head of the Kosovo Albanian negotiating team, said
the latest version of the American peace plan was ``totally
unacceptable,'' Glas, a Belgrade-based daily, reported.
	   Agani did not elaborate why the plan, presented by American
envoy Christopher Hill, was unacceptable for his side. Ethnic
Albanian negotiators were expected to come up with an official
reaction later Monday.
	   Details of the newest version of the plan have not been made
public. The American diplomat has been trying to hammer out a peace
formula acceptable to both independence-minded ethnic Albanians and
the Serb government, which wants to keep control over the province.
	   But Hill's efforts so far have been fruitless with the two sides
unable to agree on a formula.
	   Ivan Sedlak, a member of the Serbian government delegation for
Kosovo talks, said the government side still hasn't studied the
latest version of Hill's plan.
	   Sedlak said a previous version was unacceptable because it
defined Kosovo virtually as a separate state. But Sedlak did not
comment on the reworked draft.
	   Although a de-facto cease fire generated by an agreement to end
a government crackdown in Kosovo has reduced bloodshed, there are
fears that Kosovo will again explode in fierce fighting unless a
political solution is found by spring.
	   Clashes earlier this year pitting an alliance of Yugoslav army
and Serb police forces against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army claimed hundreds of lives and made more than a
quarter of a million people homeless. Serbia is the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   A previous version of the U.S. draft was rejected by Serbia
because it gave the republic almost no control over Kosovo. But
that formula was cautiously greeted by ethnic Albanian negotiators
and the guerrillas gave a mixed response, with one faction not
ruling it out as an interim solution, and the other rejecting it.
	   ``We had some objections to the previous version too, but this
one is totally unacceptable,'' Agani told Glas. ``It is obvious
that Hill offers one solution after talking to us and another after
talking to (Serbian president Milan) Milutinovic.''
	   It was not clear what changes were made to the previous draft,
but Agani's criticism suggested the reworked version gave Serbia
more authority in Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who make up more than 90 percent of Kosovo's
population, overwhelmingly seek independence from Serbia.

Despite internal struggles, EU remains upbeat on expansion

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The EU foreign ministers struggled
Monday to keep the European Union's expansion drive alive, trying
to sound welcoming to newcomers yet without committing themselves
to specific entry dates.
	   Hampering the EU is discord on how to fund a near-doubling of
the ranks and how fast to expand the union, issues that will
dominate a two-day summit opening Friday in Vienna.
	   Even so, the foreign ministers planned to send the European
leaders an upbeat report, declaring efforts to bring Cyprus, 10
East European nations and, possibly, Malta into the EU in the next
decade are well on track.
	   Negotiations opened this fall with Cyprus, Hungary, Poland, the
Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia and preliminary talks with
slower-track candidates Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and
Bulgaria.
	   The EU refuses to set firm entry dates just to ensure candidates
keep up their reform efforts to get in shape for membership.
	   The first newcomers won't join until 2004 or 2005.
	   Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are expected to get in
first. The Netherlands, Germany, France and Italy have second
thoughts about admitting a divided Cyprus.
	   Germany and France oppose accelerating talks with Lithuania,
Latvia and Slovakia _ slow-trackers which the EU head office says
do better than expected in getting ready for membership.
	   But, predictably, the EU's Scandinavian members _ Sweden,
Denmark and Finland _ welcomed the suggestion.
	   On Monday, Greece objected to Turkey being mentioned in the
enlargement report that is sent to the summit. The EU has snubbed
Turkey as a candidate, citing its dubious human rights record but
wants to keep the door ajar to future talks.
	   Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden and France insisted
that ahead of enlargement, the EU must get a grip on spending.
	   They want the EU budget to rise until 2006 only in line with
inflation from this year's level of 86 billion European currency
units (dlrs 100 billion).
	   The European Commission has proposed to link EU spending to
economic growth, adding some 20 billion ecu (dlrs 23.6 billion) to
the budget by 2006.
	   Spain and other southerners hold out for increased membership
fees, fearful they will lose special aid deals once even poorer
easterners come into the EU.
	   Germany and other northern members say they already pay far more
into the EU than they get back and want to limit their net
contributions. Germany's net payment is 22 billion marks (dlrs 13
billion) a year.
	   Complicating the money debate is Britain's refusal to give up an
annual rebate which it has been getting since 1984.
	   Worth 2.6 billion pounds (dlrs 4 billion) this year, that rebate
was granted to offset London's net payment but its partners argue
Britain is much better off now than 14 years ago.

Wembley official says twin towers will be torn down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WEMBLEY, England (AP) _ It's looking more and more likely that
the famed Twin Towers will be torn down as part of the renovation
of Wembley Stadium.
	   Wembley Stadium vice chairman Jarvis Astaire said Monday that
the 126-foot (38.5-meter) towers, considered the gateway to the
home of English soccer, will have to be razed.
	   ``The towers will have to go because the entire stadium will
need widening,'' Astaire said. ``But I believe replicas will be
built.''
	   The fate of the 75-year-old towers has been in doubt ever since
plans were announced to tear down the stadium and rebuild a new,
80,000-seat arena _ the centerpiece of England's bid for the 2006
World Cup.
	   Brent Council, which governs the borough where the stadium is
located, says its planning permission is based on the towers
forming part of the new stadium project. The council also claims it
has the right to veto any plans to demolish the towers.
	   Work on rebuilding the stadium has already been delayed. The
reconstruction was originally scheduled to start immediately after
the FA Cup final next May but is now expected to begin next fall.
	   England is hoping to stage its European Championship qualifier
against Luxembourg at Wembley on Sept. 4 before the bulldozers move
in.
	   No final decision on the towers can be made until the stadium
becomes the property of English National Stadium Trust, which is
buying the complex from Wembley Plc for 103 million pounds (dlrs
164 million).

Yugoslav parliament to pass law granting privileges for state

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Set to tighten their grip on power,
Serbian lawmakers met Monday to pass a law granting state officials
high salaries, paid servants and other lifelong privileges.
	   The law, drafted by supporters of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, has been criticized by opposition parties and
independent media. The laws are certain to put further financial
strain on Serbia's impoverished citizens with the country's average
salary about dlrs 50 and unemployment reaching some 50 percent.
	   Despite fierce criticism, the law is expected to be passed by
the deputies from Milosevic's Socialist Party and allied
ultranationalists and neo-Communists.
	   The 250-seat assembly will also adopt the 1999 budget and a
series of measures imposing taxes on private cars, mobile phones
and weapons. The cash-strapped government is hoping to accumulate
some 6 billion dinars (dlrs 600,000) by the move, reported the
Belgrade agency VIP news digest.
	   Despite growing poverty, Milosevic and his government have so
far faced little unrest. The workers have avoided street protests
led by the opposition. Critics accuse Milosevic and his aides of
accumulating wealth while destroying Serbia's economy in the past
decade of their rule.
	   In his opening speech, Premier Mirko Marjanovic praised
government achievements in the past year, blaming the hardship on
international isolation of Serbia and the additional costs of
financing a police crackdown in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian
rebels have been fighting for independence.
	   One-fourth of the 1999 budget, or 21.5 billion dinars (dlrs 2.1
billion), will go to financing police, the main pillar of
Milosevic's decade-long rule in Serbia. The rest will go to social
programs, education and other costs.
	   Under the law on ``the rights and obligations'' of the state
officials, such people as the president, parliament speaker, prime
minister and others will receive salaries 10 to 20 times the
national average.
	   The president of Serbia will enjoy benefits such as a special
residence provided by the government. He will travel free of charge
and have lifelong pension worth 85 percent of the salary as active
president.
	   After his mandate expires, the president will be granted three
paid servants, a car and an administrative clerk. His wife also
will enjoy benefits.
	   Other Serbian officials would have similar privileges, which
also include personal bodyguards for the official, his family and
house. The law is likely to be implemented retroactively, for the
period since 1990 when Milosevic was president of Serbia.
	   Milosevic became president of Yugoslavia, which includes Serbia
and Montenegro, in July 1997.
	   ``There is no end to the arrogance and greed of the authorities,
and their cruel scoffing of millions of impoverished citizens,''
the opposition Serb Democratic Party said in a statement. ``The law
... is really a law on enriching the state officials.''

Yugoslav parliament to pass law granting privileges for state

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Set to tighten their grip on power,
Serbian lawmakers met Monday to pass a law granting state officials
high salaries, paid servants and other lifelong privileges.
	   The law, drafted by supporters of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, has been criticized by opposition parties and
independent media. The laws are certain to put further financial
strain on Serbia's impoverished citizens with the country's average
salary about dlrs 50 and unemployment reaching some 50 percent.
	   Despite fierce criticism, the law is expected to be passed by
the deputies from Milosevic's Socialist Party and allied
ultranationalists and neo-Communists.
	   The 250-seat assembly will also adopt the 1999 budget and a
series of measures imposing taxes on private cars, mobile phones
and weapons. The cash-strapped government is hoping to accumulate
some 6 billion dinars (dlrs 600,000) by the move, reported the
Belgrade agency VIP news digest.
	   Despite growing poverty, Milosevic and his government have so
far faced little unrest. The workers have avoided street protests
led by the opposition. Critics accuse Milosevic and his aides of
accumulating wealth while destroying Serbia's economy in the past
decade of their rule.
	   In his opening speech, Premier Mirko Marjanovic praised
government achievements in the past year, blaming the hardship on
international isolation of Serbia and the additional costs of
financing a police crackdown in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian
rebels have been fighting for independence.
	   One-fourth of the 1999 budget, or 21.5 billion dinars (dlrs 2.1
billion), will go to financing police, the main pillar of
Milosevic's decade-long rule in Serbia. The rest will go to social
programs, education and other costs.
	   Under the law on ``the rights and obligations'' of the state
officials, such people as the president, parliament speaker, prime
minister and others will receive salaries 10 to 20 times the
national average.
	   The president of Serbia will enjoy benefits such as a special
residence provided by the government. He will travel free of charge
and have lifelong pension worth 85 percent of the salary as active
president.
	   After his mandate expires, the president will be granted three
paid servants, a car and an administrative clerk. His wife also
will enjoy benefits.
	   Other Serbian officials would have similar privileges, which
also include personal bodyguards for the official, his family and
house. The law is likely to be implemented retroactively, for the
period since 1990 when Milosevic was president of Serbia.
	   Milosevic became president of Yugoslavia, which includes Serbia
and Montenegro, in July 1997.
	   ``There is no end to the arrogance and greed of the authorities,
and their cruel scoffing of millions of impoverished citizens,''
the opposition Serb Democratic Party said in a statement. ``The law
... is really a law on enriching the state officials.''

	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ French pianist and composer Martial
Solal on Monday won the 10th annual 200,000-kroner (dlrs 31,250)
Jazzpar Prize.
	   Solal ``is continuously expressing himself with versatility, an

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. Marine forces have been conducting land
and sea maneuvers for the past week and a half in Israel's Negev
desert, a spokesman said Monday.
	   U.S. embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz said that the training
exercises were routine under U.S.-Israel security agreements,
adding that Israel was one of the few countries in the region that
allowed U.S. Marines to train on its soil.
	   Schwartz said that the Marines were conducting the exercises
alone and that the fleet would return to sea before U.S. President
Bill Clinton's visit to the region Saturday.

Donors seeking anti-corruption guarantees for aid funding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ International donors meeting this week in
Kampala are seeking guarantees of accountability from the
government before they will consider Uganda's request for an
additional dlrs 980 million in programs financing, officials said
Monday.
	   The conference of representatives of more than 20 countries and
several lending agencies which begins in the capital Wednesday,
follows a confidential World Bank report published last week that
exposed high level graft of public and donor funds.
	   Details of the report were published in the government-owned New
Vision newspaper.
	   ``Lack of accountability and transparency affects the provision
of services, especially for the poor,'' said Saskia de Lang, a
senior official at the Netherlands embassy in Kampala.
	   ``A more serious commitment of the government in this area is
considered by the donors as a necessary precondition,'' said de
Lang, speaking at a meeting of dozens of senior government
officials and donor representatives in advance of the conference.
	   The Uganda government has determined it needs dlrs 2,176 million
to finance social and economic programs over the next three years,
according to treasury secretary Emmanuel Mutebire.
	   Of that, donors have already pleged dlrs 1,190 million, and the
government is seeking added funding for the remaining dlrs 980
million, Mutebire said.
	   On Monday, the government presented donors with a request for
dlrs 57 millon for the 1998-99 financial year for the Poverty
Action Fund, a grants project for improving health and educational
facilities in rural areas.
	   The donors demanded the government provide quarterly expenditure
reports, the employment of independent auditors, published reports
on all grants, and closer involvement of district representatives
in quarterly donor meetings for the project since the local
officials are responsible for the funds.
	   Mutebire, who represented the government at Monday's meeting,
assured the donors that Uganda was committed to fighting
corruption.
	   ``Accountability will be ensured and the release of the Poverty
Action Funds will be displayed,'' Mutebire said. ``I want to assure
the donors here that we shall make sure that the value for money
shall be adhered to.''
	   President Yoweri Museveni is expected to address the four-day
conference, known as the Consultative Group, when it officially
opens on Wednesday.

Top Bosnian Serb in custody pleads innocent to genocide charges

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A top Bosnian Serb general pleaded
innocent Monday to charges that he played a pivotal role in a 1995
orgy of killing described as Europe's worst civilian massacre since
World War II.
	   Prosecutors allege that Gen. Radislav Krstic commanded Bosnian
Serb troops who massacred thousands of Muslims as they sought
shelter in the U.N.-protected ``safe haven'' of Srebrenica in
eastern Bosnia.
	   Krstic, the most senior Bosnian Serb suspect in U.N. custody,
listened carefully Monday as his 13-page genocide indictment was
read at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal.
	   Then, as each of six charges was put to him, he calmly and
confidently responded: ``I plead not guilty.''
	   He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted of
any one of the charges, which cover allegations of genocide,
extermination, murder and persecution. A trial date has not been
set.
	   Krstic, wearing a green suit, white shirt and tie, was allowed
to remain seated as he entered his pleas. His lawyer, Belgrade
attorney Nenad Petrusic, told presiding Judge Claude Jorda of
France that Krstic was suffering from serious injuries which made
it difficult for him to stand up. Krstic lost part of his right
leg, reportedly after stepping on a mine in 1994.
	   Petrusic described Krstic's health as ``truly, seriously
imperiled,'' and said there was a chance of gangrene where the limb
was amputated.
	   Asked by Jorda how he felt, Krstic said: ``As well as can be
expected on the whole, but I am tired after the arrest.
Exhausted.'' Krstic also complained that there was no heating in
his U.N. cell and that he was receiving no therapy for his injured
leg.
	   But he added that he had been treated well since his arrest last
Wednesday in northern Bosnia by U.S. troops serving in the NATO-led
Stabilization Force.
	   Krstic, reportedly a close associate of former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military leader Gen. Ratko
Mladic, is accused of helping to plan and carry out the July 1995
massacre of thousands of Muslims in Srebrenica.
	   Both Karadzic and Mladic also face genocide charges alleging
that they masterminded the slaughter, but neither is in custody.
	   According to the indictment, forces under Krstic and Mladic
``either expelled or killed'' almost every Bosnian Muslim in the
enclave using automatic weapons, hand grenades and other weaponry.
	   In Karadzic and Mladic's indictments, prosecutors estimate that
some 6,000 Muslims, mostly civilians, were killed at Srebrenica _
making it Europe's worst civilian massacre since the Holocaust.
	   Krstic's indictment, issued in October and publicized only after
his arrest, describes the killings as ``wide-scale and organized.''
The indictment had been kept secret to prevent Krstic from going
into hiding.
	   Muslims were assembled at locations including a warehouse and
schools before being summarily executed, prosecutors claim.
	   Krstic's troops also allegedly plowed victims into mass graves
in a hasty attempt to conceal the slaughter. They later dug up the
bodies and reburied them elsewhere when the international community
learned of the killings, prosecutors allege.
	   The tribunal was established in 1993 by the U.N. Security
Council to prosecute genocide and war crimes stemming from the
armed clashes that marked the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.

Reactor shut down in Ukraine after long repairs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A nuclear reactor that was restarted last
week at the Yuzhnaya nuclear power plant after lengthy delays was
automatically shut down Monday by its safety system, officials
said.
	   The shutdown was caused by an unexpected lack of electricity
feeding the reactor's control and safety equipment, said a
spokesman at the state Energoatom company, which runs Ukraine's
nuclear power plants.
	   Plant workers were studying the cause, which did not result in
any radiation leaks, the spokesman said.
	   Yuzhnaya's reactor No. 2 was shut down in June for routine
repairs and upgrades, and was supposed to be restarted in early
October. It returned to work in full only last Friday.
	   Yuzhnaya, Ukraine's second-largest plant, is located in
Yuzhnoukrainsk, 280 kilometers (174 miles) south of the capital
Kiev. It has three VVER-1000 reactors, considered more reliable
than Chernobyl-type RBMK reactors.
	   Monday's shutdown was bad news for Ukraine's already overloaded
and cash-strapped energy system, which is burdened by customer
debts and increased demand for energy during the winter.
	   Ukrainian energy plants are owed more than dlrs 1 billion by
consumers and have been working below capacity since October.
	   Energy Minister Oleksiy Sheberstov has warned that his ministry
would be forced to cut off electricity to entire regions if even
one nuclear reactor is stopped. The Cabinet has been working on a
list of enterprises that would be deprived of electricity if demand
becomes dangerously high.
	   Meanwhile, officials at two other nuclear power plants said they
are now planning to extend the repairs of two reactors until the
end of December, the independent UNIAN news agency said. The two
reactors were due to go on line Dec. 6 and Dec. 10, it said.
	   Ukraine's five nuclear power plants provide for more than 40
percent of the former Soviet republic's energy needs. At least 5 of
the 14 operational reactors are presently undergoing repairs.

South Koreans seek apology from Japanese firm over forced labor
</HEADLINE>
allegations

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two South Korean women who were allegedly forced to
work in a Japanese aircraft factory run by Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd. during World War II have asked the company for an
apology, a report said Monday.
	   Kim He Ok and Yan Kum Dok, both 67, made the request during a
visit to the factory in the central Japanese city of Nagoya where
they worked without pay from 1944 until the end of the war a year
later, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   Nagoya is located 269 kilometers (168 miles) west of Tokyo.
	   The women plan to sue Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Heavy and the
Japanese government for the wages they were never paid, the report
said.
	   Company officials were unavailable for comment late Monday.
	   A lawyer for the women said Mitsubishi Heavy did not immediately
respond to the women's demand, but pledged to look into its wartime
employment record, Kyodo reported.
	   The women said they had originally come to Japan as teenagers in
the hopes of getting high-paying jobs and continuing their
education, but were instead forced into hard labor and given little
food, the report said.
	   Japan's wartime military government forcibly brought hundreds of
thousands of young Koreans and Chinese to Japan to make up for a
domestic labor shortage during the war.
	   The laborers were forced to work under harsh conditions in mines
and private factories, and many died of malnutrition and from work
injuries.
	   Also Monday, a group of 10 Filipinos of Japanese ancestry
arrived in Japan to urge the government to give them Japanese
citizenship, Kyodo reported.
	   The group represented the offspring of Japanese who emigrated to
the Philippines before World War II but were left behind after
their families died in the war or were forcibly repatriated to
Japan.
	   The Japanese government has refused to recognize many of their
claims to citizenship.

Turkey's premier-designate fails to rally key support
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit failed
Monday to win over a key right-wing party, but said he remained
hopeful he could convince former Premier Tansu Ciller to join
forces in a coalition that excludes a pro-Islamic party.
	   After a one-hour meeting with Mrs. Ciller, leader of the
center-right True Party Party, Ecevit said she agreed to discuss
his cabinet proposal with her party members before announcing her
decision.
	   Mrs. Ciller's party, which holds 99 seats in Parliament,
indicated Friday that it would not take part in a coalition with
Ecevit and Mrs. Ciller longtime rival, Mesut Yilmaz.
	   ``It's clear that Mrs. Ciller does not favor the proposal, but
she did not give a definite answer,'' Ecevit told reporters. Ecevit
has secured the support of Yilmaz, but needs Mrs. Ciller's votes to
survive a confidence vote in Parliament.
	   During the meeting, Mrs. Ciller reiterated her preference for a
broad-based government that would include ministers from all
parties in Parliament. She said she was not opposed to Ecevit's
premiership.
	   But the staunchly pro-secular Ecevit opposes any alliance with
the pro-Islamic Virtue Party, Turkey's largest party in parliament.
The military, which pressured Turkey's first Islamic-led government
out of office last year, is also said to oppose any participation
by Virtue in the government.
	   Yilmaz' cabinet collapsed on Nov. 25 in a no-confidence vote in
Parliament. Opposition parties, including Mrs. Ciller's, accused
Yilmaz of entertaining ties with the mob and rigging the sale of a
state bank.
	   Ecevit and Mrs. Ciller are due to meet again later this week.

FBI agent could have been misled, says Ramsey Clark

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A retired FBI agent gave unreliable evidence in
the trial of a reputed Russian mafia godfather, former U.S.
Attorney General Ramsey Clark testified Monday.
	   He told the Geneva correctional court trying Sergei Mikhailov
that an investigation file used by Robert Levinson contained many
items which were ``gossip, reports from the media and deliberately
planted misinformation.''
	   He said the court should disregard the evidence given by
Levinson last Thursday because nothing could be proved.
	   Clark cited the assassination of Robert Kennedy, his predecessor
as Attorney General, as an example of how claims are made about all
sorts of things during an investigation.
	   ``From watching those files daily I know that you get
information about anything you can imagine,'' said Clark.
	   Mikhailov, 40, is accused of being a member in a criminal
organization. He denies the charge that he is the head of the
Moscow-based Solntsevskaya organized crime ring.
	   Levinson said that as a special agent of the U.S. Federal Bureau
of Investigation he spent four years looking into the activities of
the Russian mafia.
	   He said unnamed sources had told him that Mikhailov had been
personally in charge of two ``combat brigades'' specializing in
assassination, and that his Solntsevskaya organization had taken
over businesses in a number of American cities.
	   Clark said the evidence would ``never be relied upon in a court
in the U.S.'' and that Levinson would not have been allowed to
testify.
	   ``He has never said he went to Russia and personally witnessed
anything, he has never said that he even speaks or reads Russian,''
said Clark.
	   ``He hasn't established any basis on which he could possible
verify or establish the accuracy or the truthfulness of the matters
to which he had testified.''
	   During Clark's time with the administration of President Lyndon
Johnson in the 1960s, the number of cases brought against organized
crime figures increase sixfold, but he told The Associated Press it
was not odd that he was now appearing for the defense.
	   ``It is a healthy society where you can change from one side to
the other and an unhealthy society where you can't, if you are
looking for the truth,'' said Clark.

	   PARIS (AP) _ A pre-dawn fire Monday gutted a retirement home
that just a week ago failed a safety inspection, officials said.
Eight people were reported killed in the blaze and 25 others
injured, about a dozen of them seriously.
	   The head of the rescue service, Commander Jean-Luc Chivot, said
the home in Livry-Gargan, outside Paris, failed to pass a Dec. 1
inspection.
	   Among other things, the safety commission found wanting
emergency facilities that would help rescue workers in the event of
a disaster, Chivot said on France-3 television.
	   About 140 firefighters fought the 4 a.m. (0300 GMT) blaze that
officials said began in a ground-floor room and spread up the
elevator shaft over three floors.
	   Chivot estimated that the fire had been burning a half-hour
before rescue workers received an alert.
	   He said some 40 people of the approximately 80 people in the
home, located in the northern working-class area of
Seine-Seine-Denis, were evacuated by ladder.
	   ``We were able to get them out fast,'' he said, ``Otherwise, the
death toll would have been higher.''
	   Authorities reported seven deaths initially, but France Info
radio said an eighth person had since died. The information was not
immediately officially confirmed.
	   In a northern Paris neighborhood, another fire left three people
dead and 13 hurt, three seriously, firefighters said.
	   That blaze broke out at about 3 a.m. (0200 GMT), and 150
firefighters with 43 trucks took an hour to knock it down, the
officials said on customary anonymity.
	   The fire, in the 9th district near Montmartre, began in a
staircase and spread to the fourth, fifth and sixth floors,
officials said.
	   The cause of both blazes was under investigation.
	   According to the all-news television station LCI, the nursing
home fire may have been started by a short circuit in an electric
bed. The source of that information was not immediately known.
	   Health Minister Bernard Kouchner visited the town hall at
Livry-Gargan to meet with local officials.
	   The mayor of the town, Alain Calmat, said on LCI that the
nursing home was built in 1965, before new building standards were
set. Work to get the nursing home up to standards was in progress,
he said.

Police arrest Real IRA suspect, seize weaponry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police on Monday arrested a man
suspected of helping plan August's car bombing of the town of
Omagh, Northern Ireland's deadliest-ever terrorist strike that left
29 dead.
	   Detectives said they found a Kalashnikov assault rifle, a
handgun, ammunition and a substantial cache of bomb-making
components in a raid on the 42-year-old man's home in Dundalk, a
border town in the Irish Republic 50 miles (80 kms) south of
Belfast.
	   Police in both parts of Ireland have already arrested but
released without charge more than 40 people suspected of belonging
to the Irish Republican Army dissident gang that carried out the
Aug. 15 attack. However, none of those suspects was caught in
possession of weaponry.
	   The dissidents, who oppose the IRA's July 1997 cease-fire and
refuse to call themselves by a different name, were dubbed the Real
IRA by Irish media. They called a truce in September in response to
public horror over Omagh.
	   The arrest came as leaders of all eight Northern Irish parties
that supported April's peace accord gathered in the United States
to receive two joint peace awards.
	   Among the leaders are Protestant politician David Trimble and
Catholic politician John Hume, who on Thursday will share the Nobel
Peace Prize at a ceremony in Oslo, Norway.
	   But in a symbol of how far apart Northern Ireland's key
peacemakers remain, Trimble decided not to attend the first awards
ceremony Monday at the John F. Kennedy library in Boston, where the
other seven leaders were expected to be greeted by Sen. Edward
Kennedy. Trimble instead was attending a reception at the British
embassy in Washington.
	   On Tuesday, all eight are expected to receive a joint accolade
from the Washington-based National Democratic Institute.
	   Trimble's Ulster Unionist Party and Hume's Social Democratic and
Labor Party are supposed to occupy most positions in a new
multiparty administration for Northern Ireland. But they have
argued for months about the intended shape, scope and powers of
their coalition government, endangering a chain of deadlines in
April's accord.
	   Trimble also refuses to let the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party _
Hume's militant rival for Catholic votes _ participate in a new
government until the IRA starts disarming. The IRA says it will
never fulfill that long-sought Protestant demand.
	   Speaking at Belfast International Airport, Sinn Fein leader
Gerry Adams said he was traveling to Boston and Washington ``with
extreme reluctance, because these certainly are ego trips, and the
peace process isn't about picking up peace prizes.''
	   Also Monday, the reputed commander of Northern Ireland's most
ruthless Protestant paramilitary group was arraigned on charges of
possessing a firearm and threatening another man's life.
	   Mark ``Swinger'' Fulton, 38, pleaded not guilty to accusations
he fired gun shots outside the home of a Protestant man. He was
ordered held without bail.
	   Police identify him as the successor to Billy ``King Rat''
Wright, founder of the outlawed Loyalist Volunteer Force, who was
assassinated last year in jail. The organization called a truce in
May.

	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ French pianist and composer Martial
Solal on Monday won the 10th annual 200,000-kroner (dlrs 31,250)
Jazzpar Prize.
	   Solal ``is continuously expressing himself with versatility, an
inventiveness and a mastery of the piano that is astonishing if not
directly awesome,'' the award committee said.
	   Born in Algiers, Algeria, in 1927, Solal is the first recipient
from a non-English-speaking country of the award, created in 1989
by the Danish Jazz Center.
	   Solal ``has the instrument completely under his sway and uses
remarkable technique to carry into effect a synthesis of greater
part of jazz history, adding quite a bit of himself,'' according to
the committee, which includes a panel of international jazz
critics.

David Batty's move to Leeds finally done
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ After weeks of speculation and
negotiation, David Batty is finally returning to Leeds.
	   Agreement was reached Monday on a 4.4-million-pound (dlrs 7
million) transfer deal allowing the 30-year-old England midfielder
to move from Newcastle to Elland Road _ where he began his career
11 years ago.
	   Batty's move is subject to him passing a physical exam and
agreeing to personal terms.
	   Batty, who was born in Leeds, played for the club from 1987 to
1993, winning the league title in 1992. He moved to Blackburn in
1993, then joined Newcastle in 1996.
	   Batty signed a five-year contract extension at Newcastle this
summer but has not fit in under Ruud Gullit, who took over as
manager after Kenny Dalglish was fired earlier this season.
	   His transfer request was accepted by Newcastle 10 days ago but
the two clubs were unable to agree on a fee.
	   Leeds had an original bid of 4 million pounds (dlrs 6.4 million)
rejected, with the Magpies believed to be holding out for closer to
6 million pounds (dlrs 9.6 million).
	   But the deadlock was broken when Leeds upped its offer and Batty
agreed to waive 800,000 pounds (dlrs 1.2 million) in signing
bonuses.
	   Batty will be David O'Leary's first major signing since he took
over as Leeds manager on Oct. 25.
	   Leeds is third in the Premier League.

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Six years after leading a bloody coup
attempt, Hugo Chavez rode a wave of fierce public discontent to win
Venezuela's presidency by the largest margin in 40 years.
	   The lower classes that Chavez championed celebrated wildly in
the streets after Sunday's victory. Across the country, they honked
horns, set off fireworks and shouted ``Chavez! Chavez!'' Many
donned the winner's trademark red beret.
	   Terrified by his fiery populist rhetoric, Chavez's opponents had
branded the cashiered lieutenant colonel a dictator-in-waiting,
poised to impose a socialist regime.
	   Chavez tried to salve the wounds of a divisive campaign that
often took on overtones of class warfare.
	   ``I don't have even a millimeter of hate or rancor in my
heart,'' he told tens of thousands of supporters, some of them
fighting off tears, in downtown Caracas. Their celebrations lasted
into early Monday.
	   Standing above a 90-foot (27-meter) Venezuelan flag, the former
army paratrooper vowed ``to rebuild the country'' and call a
referendum to rewrite the constitution.
	   But he also declared himself a fiscal conservative and said he
would streamline Venezuela's bloated bureaucracy. Monday was a bank
holiday, so it was too early to gauge investor reaction.
	   In a two-hour news conference, Chavez, 44, also offered to work
with politicians from Venezuela's two traditional parties, the
center-left Democratic Action and the center-right COPEI.
	   Both parties, blamed by most Venezuelans for squandering the
world's largest oil reserves outside the Middle East, withdrew
their candidates last week to rally behind Henrique Salas Romer,
the Yale-educated former state governor that Chavez defeated
handily Sunday.
	   With 78 percent of the votes counted, Chavez had 56.5 percent to
39.5 percent for Salas, according to official results, and turnout
was high for Venezuela at 65 percent.
	   Jubilant supporters poured into the streets to celebrate what
they considered a triumph of the masses over a political elite that
has failed to ease poverty and eradicate corruption.
	   On Nov. 8, Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition won a
plurality of Congress in Nov. 8 regional elections, erasing the
traditional parties' political dominance.
	   At his news conference, Chavez said the post-election euphoria
reflected more than a personal victory.
	   ``In truth, I'm not Chavez. Chavez is a national feeling. Chavez
is a project,'' he told reporters, repeatedly invoking dictums from
independence leader Simon Bolivar.
	   He acknowledged, however, that there could be no quick fix for
Venezuela's problems: plummeting living standards and corruption
are deeply ingrained in government and business.
	   ``I don't believe the Venezuelan people think I am a messiah,
some kind of magician,'' he said.
	   Chavez said he would not impose exchange controls or other
radical economic measures, as his opponents have claimed. He said,
however, that he would seek to restructure Venezuela's dlrs 21
billion foreign debt, which eats up 30 percent of the national
budget.
	   The president-elect also promised to cut government spending,
seek ways to increase the country's dlrs 175 monthly minimum wage
and end rampant tax evasion.
	   In 1992, Chavez led a failed coup attempt by 15,000 rebel
soldiers. Dozens of people died in the attempt, though the actual
number was never clear. Jailed, he was pardoned two years later.
	   The United States denied Chavez a visa last year, but a
victorious Chavez said he expected tensions with Washington to
subside by the time he takes office Feb. 2.
	   Venezuela is the number one exporter of oil to the United
States.
	   The Chavez victory was ``fueled by rabid discontent, the violent
fall of our currency, the rise in the cost-of-living and the hunger
in millions of Venezuelan homes,'' commented ex-President Carlos
Andres Perez, whom Chavez had tried to overthrow in 1992.
	   Many considered Chavez's rise a red warning flag for Latin
America, where the gulf between rich and poor is the widest in the
world.
	   An economic crisis caused by a 12-year low in oil prices has
made making ends meet all but impossible for most Venezuelans,
whose living standards have been in steady decline for more than 15
years.
	   Chavez's militaristic rhetoric terrified upper crust Venezuela,
and many wealthy people have fled to Miami.
	   ``He's a crazy man on the loose, a communist,'' said Elena
Alamos, an elderly woman casting her vote in Caracas's upper-class
Altamira district.

Pope to address parliament during June pilgrimage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Pope John Paul II will address Poland's
parliament when he makes his eighth pilgrimage to his homeland next
year, the prime minister's office announced Monday.
	   John Paul, who recently celebrated the 20th anniversary of his
papacy, is planning a 10-day visit in June.
	   During the pilgrimage, the pope is expected to beatify more than
100 Poles killed under Nazi occupation.
	   John Paul's papacy is closely linked to Poland's shift from
decades of communist rule to the multiparty democracy that
functions today.
	   With more than 90 percent of the Poland's 39 million people
identifying themselves as Catholic, John Paul's surprise ascendancy
to the papacy became a unifying symbol for the country.
	   Former political activists credit the pope's first pilgrimage to
Poland in 1979 for bringing together huge crowds that showed the
strength of popular support for political opposition. A year later,
the Solidarity trade union formed and eventually led the movement
to topple communism.
	   Later pilgrimages were credited with lifting sagging spirits
during the martial law years and keeping alive the Solidarity theme
of unity.
	   But after a 1989 election ended communist rule, Poles were stung
when John Paul, during two visits in 1991, warned against embracing
the materialism of the Western world too quickly and delivered
harsh homilies against abortion.
	   Opinion polls consistently show John Paul to be Poland's most
popular and trusted figure, but his conservate Catholicism and the
strong role the church plays in daily life have been blamed for
reduced church attendance.

World wool production heads for 30-year low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ World wool production this season will hit its
lowest level since the 1960s, the International Wool Textile
Organization predicted Monday.
	   The agency said that, in line with falls throughout this decade,
global production in the 1998-99 (July-June) season would total an
estimated 1.420 million metric tons (clean basis), compared with
1.446 million tons estimated for 1997-98.
	   The Brussels-based body said the decline was due to poor demand
and low prices forcing farmers to switch to more profitable
products.
	   In 1989-90, wool output hit a record high of 2.01 million tons.
Subsequent declines have been particularly marked in former Soviet
Union countries and in Australia.
	   The breakdown of the IWTO's first 1998-99 global clip forecast _
in thousands of metric tons (clean basis), with 1997-98 comparisons
in parentheses _ included: Australia 442 (452), New Zealand 186
(197), China 147 (145), former Soviet Union 94 (93), Uruguay 48
(55), U.K. 44 (44), Argentina 37 (37), Turkey 36 (36), South Africa
33 (34), India 28 (28), Pakistan 24 (23), Iran 23 (23), Irish
Republic 17 (17), Spain 16 (16), Morocco 15 (15), U.S.A. 14 (15),
Brazil 11 (11), Mongolia 11 (11), Romania 11 (11) and France 10

Muslim forensic team opened a new mass-grave
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The Muslim Commission for
Missing Persons began digging Monday at a mass-grave in northwest
Bosnia where it expects to find the remains of more than 150
Muslims killed during the Bosnian war, state radio reported.
	   They were believed to have been prisoners in the Bosnian Serb's
prison camp Omarska near town of Prijedor.
	   The government believes Bosnian Serb troops brought Muslims to
the site in 1992, massacred them and dumped the bodies into a
natural pit near the town of Sanski Most, some 140 kilometers (87.5
miles) north-west of Sarajevo.
	   Although it had been announced that all exhumations would be
stopped until next spring, Muslim forensic team began working at
the site.
	   The deputy head of the Muslim Commission, Jasmin Odobasic, said
it was hard to say how long the work would take because of the
winter weather.
	   About 200,000 people were killed during the Bosnian 1992-1995
war. More than 20,000 went missing and are feared dead.
	   Because of that, all three groups in Bosnia _ Muslims, Serbs and
Croats _ formed teams who have been working on the issue of the
missing persons.
	   During 1996 and 1997, a total of 500 remains were exhumed. This
year, the number has increased to 1,700, all but 400 of them
Muslims.
	   Former Sen. Bob Dole, who is chairman of the International
Commission on Missing Persons, visited a Bosnian capital of
Sarajevo last weekend and discussed this issue with local and
international officials.

Roma, Parma, Bologna in Italian charge towards last eight

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ With AS Roma and Bologna ahead from the first legs
and Parma at home to Glasgow Rangers with the scores even, Italy
has a great chance of getting all three teams into the last eight
of the UEFA Cup Tuesday.
	   France and Spain each have four teams each in the third round
but may have to make do with two quarterfinalists each.
	   Roma takes a slender 1-0 lead to FA Zurich in Tuesday's third
round second leg but comes off a rousing 5-1 beating of Perugia in
Serie A. Roma has the best attack in the league and is tied for
second place in the standings.
	   Roma has to decide whether to sit back on its first leg lead or
continue its attack-minded style favored by coach Zdenek Zeman.
	   ``How do we get past Zurich? By forcing a 0-0 draw,'' said
striker Francesco Totti, recently called up by the Italian national
team. ``But we will not sit back and form a barrier. That's not our
style.''
	   Bologna goes to Real Betis with a 4-1 first leg lead although it
had its 9-game unbeaten streak ended by Serie A leader Fiorentina
on a 1-0 scoreline. It also has the second best defense in the
domestic league, yielding less than a goal a game.
	   Parma, which has the best defense including French star Lilian
Thuram and Italian international centerback Fabio Cannavaro, is
tied for second with Roma in the Italian league and has Argentina
striker Hernan Crespo teaming up well with Enrico Chiesa. They have
scored 12 goals between them in Serie A.
	   Rangers upset Bayer Leverkusen in the previous round but on
Saturday was held at home by last place Dunfermline in the Scottish
Premier League.
	   Having outplayed Liverpool 3-1 at home, Spanish club Celta Vigo
will be confident of holding on to that lead at Anfield, especially
with the English club sliding to ninth in the Premier League.
	   Celta, which is third in Spain, also will have international
striker Michel Salgado back in the lineup. He missed the first leg
through suspension and teams up with Russian stars Alexander
Mostovoi and Valery Karpin and Yugoslav striker Vlado Gudelj, who
scored the goals in Vigo.
	   With England midfielder Paul Ince suspended, striker Robbie
Fowler will captain Liverpool for the first time, teaming up in
attack with Michael Owen.
	   Spain is sure of a quarterfinal place because Atletico Madrid
meets Real Sociedad with the visitor leading 2-1 from the first
leg. Sociedad striker Darko Kovacevic has netted eight times in
European play this season, including six from headers.
	   The Olympique Marseille-Monaco pairing also ensures a French
team in the last eight with the two teams tied at 2-2.
	   A semifinalist in last season's Champions Cup, Monaco goes to
Marseille without sweeper Franck Dumas, who is suspended after
being shown the red card in the first leg.
	   Bordeaux came away from Zurich with a 3-3 tie against
Grasshoppers and those away goals will be useful if the game is
tied again.
	   ``If we look for a draw we are dead,'' said coach Elie Haup.
``We don't know how to play like that.''
	   Grasshoppers will badly miss injured striker Kubilay
Tuerkyilmaz, who scored one goal and set up another in the first
leg.
	   Lyon takes a 1-0 advantage to Belgium's FC Brugge but will be
without suspended Swiss striker Marco Grassi, who was sent off in
the first leg.

Scottish museum wants William Wallace letter from Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ The new Museum of Scotland on Monday
set its sights on a letter written by Scottish hero William Wallace
that was discovered recently in Germany.
	   The 13th century letter, discovered in the German city of
Lubeck, is considered invaluable to the museum because so far it is
the only authenticated object associated with Wallace, whose life
was the inspiration for the hit movie, ``Braveheart.''
	   The museum, which opened in Edinburgh last week, will seek a
copy or a loan of the letter, written in Latin following Wallace's
victory over the English at the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297.
	   It notifies the people of north Germany that Scotland is free
from the ``power of the English'' and invites them to reopen trade
routes through Scottish ports.
	   A second copy of the letter was delivered to Hamburg, but it is
believed to have been destroyed during World War II.
	   ``The National Museums of Scotland is delighted by the
rediscovery of the letter,'' said Mark Jones, director of the
museum. ``It will, in consultation with the National Library of
Scotland, seek a loan of the letter so that it can be exhibited in
the Museum of Scotland.''
	   Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond called the lack of
any material on William Wallace a ``galling omission'' and urged
the museum to take immediate steps to obtain the Lubeck letter.

EU negotiator seeks support for South African trade deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's top negotiator in
talks with South Africa sought backing from EU governments Monday
to break months of deadlock and keep alive hopes of concluding a
broad free-trade deal by the year's end.
	   Joao de Deus Pinheiro, EU commissioner for African affairs came
close to wrapping up a agreement last month to phase out duties on
some 90 percent of EU-South Africa trade, which is worth dlrs 19
billion a year.
	   On Monday, Pinheiro was looking for more support from the 15 EU
foreign ministers, but hopes of a breakthrough were dimmed by
continued divisions over the labeling of fortified wines.
	   The Europeans want South African vintners to stop using the
names ``sherry'' or ``port'' for some of their wines. The EU argues
that only Spain can produce wines called sherry and only wines from
the Portuguese city of Oporto can be labeled as port. South Africa
claims to have used the terms for 300 years.
	   Portuguese officials said they were demanding a commitment that
South African winemakers phase out the names over the next decade
in international and domestic markets.
	   Sales of South African wine labeled port or sherry are worth
about 750 million rand (dlrs 123 million), of which 13 percent
comes from exports.
	   Portuguese officials said other EU nations had problems with
canned fruit imports and access to South African waters for
European fishing boats.
	   After four years of painstaking negotiations, the two sides are
under pressure to wrap up a deal. EU leaders at a meeting with
President Nelson Mandela in June, pledged to conclude talks by the
autumn.
	   Diplomats fear negotiations could become bogged down in
campaigning for national elections in South Africa next year if
they drag on much longer.

Nazi victims gather to share memories of Holocaust
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Graying and sorrowful, they
huddled in small groups, swapping harrowing memories of Auschwitz.
	   About 750 Dutch victims of World War II atrocities gathered
Monday at a symposium to share stories of their suffering _ first
in Nazi death camps, and later in an indifferent homeland.
	   ``There aren't enough papers and pens out there to describe how
I feel,'' said Benjamin van Beem, 76, who survived the Auschwitz
death camp.
	   With the theme ``Repatriation and Reception: A Matter of
Acknowledgment,'' Monday's gathering _ the first of its kind in the
Netherlands _ focused especially on the chilly reception many
victims experienced when they finally returned home.
	   The participants, who included Dutch Jews, gypsies and victims
of Japanese aggressors in the colonial Dutch East Indies, now
Indonesia, said they hope their experiences will no longer be
shunned but remembered.
	   ``We need to give the experiences of victims a place in Dutch
history,'' said Conny Kristel, director of the Foundation for
Research Repatriation and Reception, which organized the one-day
conference.
	   During the government-sponsored gathering, which coincided with
the anniversary of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, victims
split up into small groups where they shared their gut-wrenching
stories. Historians from the foundation hope to compile all the
experiences into a book to be published in 2001.
	   For many survivors, it's too little and too late.
	   ``Why are we doing this 50 years later? Most of the survivors
aren't around anymore,'' said Barend Zwaaf, 77, his Auschwitz
prisoner ID number still tattooed on his arm.
	   ``People don't understand why I still have my identification
number on my arm,'' he said. ``Someone said to me once, `Mister,
are you so stupid that you can't remember your own telephone number
and you have to write it on your arm?'''
	   About three in four Dutch Jews _ more than 100,000 people _ died
in the Holocaust. Many of those who managed to survive were
orphaned, their houses taken over by strangers and their
possessions seized by Nazi soldiers. Some said they returned from
death camps to find the Dutch government and their compatriots
ignorant and unsympathetic to their plight.
	   ``I was the only one left in my family. My house was gone, and I
was left with only the old shirt on my back,'' Van Beem recalled.
``What did the Dutch government do for us? They didn't do
anything.''
	   The harsh postwar circumstances were partly to blame, said Dutch
Prime Minister Wim Kok, who opened the symposium.
	   In his address, Kok explained how the country _ bankrupt and in
ruins _ focused all its attention on rebuilding and tried to avoid
dwelling on the past. Victims, he conceded, were left to endure
their pain in private.
	   ``Our sights were set on the future and emotions received little
attention,'' Kok said.
	   Monday's conference continued a turnabout for the Dutch, whose
WWII memories have mostly focused on the brutal Nazi occupation and
the country's bold underground resistance. In recent years,
however, a slew of controversies over the poor postwar treatment of
Dutch Jews and the mismanagement of their assets have painted a
different picture of the past.
	   In a 1968 incident disclosed only last year, Dutch civil
servants auctioned off among themselves _ and at bargain prices _
jewelry and other valuables belonging to Dutch Jews who died in
concentration camps.
	   ``Now we're here to talk about acknowledgement,'' Van Beem said,
but added bitterly: ``What difference will a book make now? Who
will read it?''

Virenque says he will quit cycling over doping scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new quotes, details, background; Editing thruout &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Still maintaining that he never took banned drugs,
Richard Virenque says he will quit cycling because the doping
scandals overshadowing the sport are preventing him from finding a
new team.
	   Virenque, 29, has been unable to find a team since last month's
decision by Festina to break with the cyclist.
	   Late Sunday, he issued a statement saying that he would be
quitting the sport.
	   ``He (Virenque) has the impression that he is leaving a job
unfinished and he wants to apologize to his supporters. He would
like to keep making them dream, but it is not possible anymore,''
said the statement by Virenque, issued in the third person.
	   Since joining Festina in 1994, Virenque placed third in the 1996
Tour de France and second the following year.
	   He was king of the mountain legs in the classic race for four
consecutive years, between 1994 and 1997.
	   But Festina fell into disgrace this year when its masseur, Willy
Voet, was arrested driving a team car loaded with banned drugs just
before the start of the Tour de France.
	   Team officials later revealed to investigators what they said
was systematic use of banned drugs within the team.
	   Three Festina officials are under formal investigation, one step
short of being charged: Voet; team doctor Eric Ryckaert; and
sporting director Bruno Roussel.
	   But Virenque remains one of two Festina cyclists that continue
to deny the charge -- a move which has alienated him from both the
Festina team and cyclists.
	   In November, Festina said that it would not renew its contract
with Virenque which expires at the end of this month, citing the
doping scandal and Virenque's refusal to accept a 75-percent salary
cut.
	   Pressure on Virenque grew last week with the publication of a
judicial report that suggested he too took banned substances.
	   Voet, who has continued to accuse Virenque of taking drugs, said
he was disappointed at Virenque's decision.
	   ``If we get to a situation where a cyclist must stop his career
because he has taken doping substances, then there are masses who
must stop their career, because there is a problem in the system,''
Voet said on TF1 television.
	   But colleagues said that Virenque's position was becoming
unbearable.
	   ``You can't beat a whole army of journalists who only want one
thing, for him to stop,'' his wife Stephanie Virenque told Europe 1
radio. ``Today, we are unfortunately obliged to tell them that they
have won.''
	   But she added that if another team were to offer Virenque a
contract, he would be back in the saddle.
	   ``He would go, because cycling is his life's goal,'' she said.
``We still have a small hope that for Christmas there will be a
team that has confidence in him and reaches out when everyone else
is turning their back.''

Italian champions, minus Del Piero, have lost their way
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ It could be beginning of the end of an era for
Juventus of Turin.
	   The Italian League champion three of the past four years is
mired in the worst slump of coach Marcello Lippi's highly
successful tenure, and there's little relief in sight.
	   The numbers are not pretty.
	   After Sunday's 1-0 home loss to Lazio of Rome, Juventus in
winless in five games, and has been shut out in four straight. Only
once in the franchise's 101 years has it ever gone without a goal
in five games, way back in the 1967-68 season.
	   The defeat was the team's first in 20 months at its Delle Alpi
Stadium, its four losses in 12 league games so far are twice as
many as the club had in 34 matches last season, and it already
trails Serie A leader Fiorentina by 7 points in the standings.
	   The club is also on the verge of elimination from the European
Champions League.
	   ``It's a rough stretch,'' Lippi acknowledged. ``We're well aware
of the negative figures that are adding up. ... But there is
absolutely no desire to abdicate. We will not give up.''
	   Things might get worse before they get better.
	   The next week brings two must-win outings: home to Norway's
Rosenborg in the Champions League on Wednesday and at Fiorentina on
Sunday.
	   There are explanations for the team's troubles, with the
simplest being Alessandro Del Piero's injury.
	   The star striker tore knee ligaments last month, had surgery in
the United States, and is out for the season _ with no suitable
replacement in sight. Forward Filippo Inzaghi is essentially alone
up front.
	   There also have been the widening investigations into drug use
in Italian soccer, with a Turin prosecutor focusing on Juventus and
seizing the club's medical records. Several players, including Del
Piero and French World Cup heroes Zinedine Zidane and Didier
Deschamps, plus Lippi, have been questioned.
	   Another distraction is the coaching situation. Lippi, who came
to the club in 1994, is almost certain to leave when his contract
expires at season's end, and speculation on a replacement began in
the summer.
	   Juve has reached the Champions Cup final three straight years,
and won it in 1996. But the team has drawn all five of its Group B
matches so far and chances for a quarterfinal spot are slim:
Juventus must beat Rosenborg and hope Spain's Athletic Bilbao
defeats Turkey's Galatasaray.
	   ``Wednesday is absolutely decisive,'' Lippi said. ``We know we
haven't been very good in the Champions League so far this season.
But we still believe in ourselves.''
	   One of Juve's trademarks under Lippi has been confidence, but
that seems to be fading, too.
	   ``We'll take a miracle right now,'' Inzaghi said, referring to
the complicated Champions League scenario. ``Anything to get us
going.''

Kosovo Albanian negotiator: U.S. plan totally unacceptable
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Albanian comment; CHANGES attribution &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. peace efforts in Kosovo
suffered a setback Monday, with the chief ethnic Albanian
negotiator rejecting a draft for the future of the majority ethnic
Albanian province of Serbia.
	   Fehmi Agani, head of the Kosovo Albanian negotiating team, said
the latest version of the American peace plan was ``almost
identical to the Serbian proposal for Kosovo'' and ``cannot be
considered a basis for... future negotiations.''
	   Agani said the previous U.S. draft for Kosovo ``envisaged the
formation of independent institutions'' in the province, although
it did not provide for independence as the ethnic Albanians have
demanded. Agani said that version, which the Serbs rejected,
``opened up perspective.''
	   Agani, however, said the latest version accepted a major Serb
demand, which is to have Kosovo remain part of Serbia substantially
within Serbia's legal system.
	   Agani said the changes in the latest version of the U.S. draft
were ``incomprehensible.''
	   The plan was presented by American envoy Christopher Hill, who
has been trying to hammer out a peace formula acceptable to both
independence-minded ethnic Albanians and the Serb government.
	   But Hill's efforts so far have been fruitless with the two sides
unable to agree on a formula.
	   Ivan Sedlak, a member of the Serbian government delegation for
Kosovo talks, said the government side still hasn't studied the
latest version of Hill's plan.
	   Sedlak said a previous version was unacceptable because it
defined Kosovo virtually as a separate state. But Sedlak did not
comment on the reworked draft.
	   Although a de-facto cease fire generated by an agreement to end
a government crackdown in Kosovo has reduced bloodshed, there are
fears that Kosovo will again explode in fierce fighting unless a
political solution is found by spring.
	   Clashes earlier this year pitting an alliance of Yugoslav army
and Serb police forces against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army claimed hundreds of lives and made more than a
quarter of a million people homeless. Serbia is the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   A previous version of the U.S. draft was rejected by Serbia
because it gave the republic almost no control over Kosovo. But
that formula was cautiously greeted by ethnic Albanian negotiators
and the guerrillas gave a mixed response, with one faction not
ruling it out as an interim solution, and the other rejecting it.
	   ``We had some objections to the previous version too, but this
one is totally unacceptable,'' Agani told Glas. ``It is obvious
that Hill offers one solution after talking to us and another after
talking to (Serbian president Milan) Milutinovic.''
	   It was not clear what changes were made to the previous draft,
but Agani's criticism suggested the reworked version gave Serbia
more authority in Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who make up more than 90 percent of Kosovo's
population, overwhelmingly seek independence from Serbia.

Japan takes gold medals lead with swimming, judo victories
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with swimming, gymnastics, other later medals &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan dented China's supremacy in the
swimming pool and host Thailand won two gold medals for the home
fans Monday on the first full day of medals competition at the
Asian Games.
	   Japan's two gold medals in the pool, including Yasuko Tajima's
triumph over China's world record holders Chen Yan and Wu Yanyan in
the women's 400-meter individual medley, put it atop the standings
with seven golds in all.
	   It also swept the day's three golds in its native martial art of
judo, while South Korea swept four golds in its combat sport,
taekwondo.
	   That left South Korea with five golds, one behind China. The
Chinese took three in swimming, two in weightlifting _ with help
from a world record lift _ and one in gymnastics.
	   North Korea, back in the games after skipping 1994 in Hiroshima,
Japan, took a shooting gold, as did Kazakstan.
	   Thailand and South Korea won the day's two other shootings
golds.
	   Thailand and Japan triumphed in the Asian Games' inaugural
mountain biking races, barreling downhill near a park where
elephants and tigers roam.
	   On the baseball field, U.S. Major League pitcher Park Chan-ho of
the Los Angeles Dodgers led South Korea to a 16-5 victory over
Taiwan as American scouts watched for more like him. Park pitched
five innings, yielding four hits and one run and striking out five.
	   But among the surprises, Tajima's finish of 4 minutes, 39.92
seconds in the women's medley put her far ahead of Chen, the world
record holder in the event, and Wu, who has the world best in the
200-meter medley.
	   Wu took silver in 4:46.74 and Chen won the bronze in 4:47.34.
	   ``You don't have a chance often to beat them so you have to take
it. But I want to meet them in their best condition,'' said Tajima,
who now is aiming at a 2000 Olympic gold and a world record.
	   Japan's Yosuke Ichikawa disappointed an overflow crowd at the
pool when he edged Thailand's Torlap Sethsothorn 1:52.46 to 1:52.53
in the men's 200-meter freestyle.
	   China's winners were Shan Ying in the women's 100-meter

	   In weightlifting, China's Liu Xiuhua set a world record with a
snatch of 83.5 kilograms on her way to winning 48-kilogram division
women's weightlifting. Compatriot Lan Shizhang won in the men's
56-kilogram division.
	   Liu's 83.5 broke the world mark of 83.0 set by China's Li Zhuo
on Sept. 16.
	   The Chinese had little trouble defending their men's gymnastics
team title and, like others at these games, talked about the
upcoming Olympics in Sydney.
	   ``This is training the troops,'' said coach Huang Yubin after
his team piled up 230.200 points to 225.750 for South Korea and
225.375 for Japan.
	   The Chinese men now have won every Asian Games gymnastics team
contest since 1974.
	   Phannarong Kongsamut won Thailand's first gold of the games,
taking the mountain bike race in 3 minutes, 43.13 seconds, with
Takashi Tsukamoto of Japan second in 3:44.79 and Brian Cook of Hong
Kong third in 3:57.65.
	   In the women's race, Sachiko Kamakura and Mami Masuda gave Japan
a 1-2 sweep, although Kamakura was more than 17 seconds ahead in
4:26.49. Taiwan's Chen Ju-miao took the bronze in 4:54.18.
	   In shooting, South Korea's Kim Jung-mi edged Thailand's T.
Pupiromchaikul 498.6 to 496.6 for the women's air rifle gold, and
her team took silver behind the Thais, 1,178 to 1,171.
	   North Korea won the men's free pistol team event, 1,680 to 1,668
over China, while Kazakstan's Vladimir Guchsha beat China's Wang
Yifu 657.8 to 655.5 for the individual gold.
	   Olympic silver medalist Yukimasa Nakamura needed only one
minute, 10 seconds for a clean ippon victory over Kazakstan's Ivan
Baglayev in judo's half lightweight division for men.
	   At extra lightweight, Kazuhiko Tokuno needed 4:53 to finish
China's Yang Bo.
	   In the women's extra lightweight class, Tomoe Makabe overcame
North Korea's Cha Hyon Hyang.
	   South Koreans beat Vietnamese for two of their taekwondo golds.

and Park Hee-kang decisioned Nguyen Duy Khuong in the men's fin
weight.
	   China's He Luming was initially awarded victory by superiority

middleweight final.

 &UR; Party without platform or leader wins majority in Nigeria's local
elections &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede to include party presidential hopeful is former
military leader, Edits to conform. Pick up 11th graf pvs. Final
results no longer expected Monday. &QL; 
 &UR; By GLENN McKENZIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Although it has an unclear platform and no
leader, a party whose presidential hopefuls include a former
military ruler, has won more than half the seats in Nigeria's key
local council elections, an official said Monday.
	   The weekend vote, seen as a test of the planned transition from
military rule to democracy in this ethnically-divided West African
country, was praised by election observers from the Commonwealth of
Britain and its former colonies.
	   Voters turned out in huge numbers for the polls although there
were reported logistical glitches and clashes that reportedly
killed 14 people.
	   In a statement, Commonwealth Secretary General Emeka Anyaokou,
himself a Nigerian, said the ``successful conduct of the vote''
bodes well for upcoming state and presidential elections.
	   Nigeria's military leader Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who took
over when the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha died earlier this
year, has engineered the transition and pledged to hand over power
to elected civilians on May 29.
	   The PDP was formed earlier this year by 34 well known academics,
politicians, tribal leaders and former military generals who
opposed Abacha's autocratic rule. Its presidential hopefuls include
former military ruler Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo.
	   Observers say those voting for the PDP were hoping for consensus
between the army and civilian society. Military meddling and armed
coups have long been part of Nigerian politics _ the army has held
power for all but 10 years since independence in 1960.
	   An election official speaking on condition of anonymity said the
Peoples' Democratic Party had won at least 390 of the 774 local
council posts. In distant second place was the PDP's main rival,
the All Peoples' Party with 145 seats, while the Alliance for
Democracy has 80 seats.
	   About 100 seats remained to be counted.
	   Results released late Sunday and published in Nigerian
newspapers also showed the PDP's winning 337 seats compared with
130 for the APP and 70 for the AD. No vote percentages were
released and it remains unclear how many people voted in this
country of more than 100 million people, although turnout was high
and 50 million were registered for the ballot.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ----
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ President Yoweri Museveni's brother has
resigned as a presidential security advisor over a controversial
sale of a former state bank, it was reported Monday.
	   Maj. Gen. Salim Saleh resigned after it was disclosed he had
bought majority shares in a Malaysian firm, Westmont Berhad, which
had earlier bought 51 percent shares of the state-owned Uganda
Commercial Bank, the government-owned New Vision newspaper
reported.
	   Saleh's plan was to indirectly take control of the commercial
bank through the Greenland Bank as a front.
	   Hope Kivengere, Museveni's press secretary, said in a statement
Sunday night that Saleh's move amounted to corruption.
	   ``In his resignation letter, Maj. Gen. Saleh regretted having
failed to live up to the standards expected of him as a leading
cadre in the (National Resistance) Movement and having failed to
discharge his duties as a senior advisor which required him to
exercise good judgment,'' the Kivengere statement said.
	   Museveni appointed Saleh, who is reputed to be one of the
richest Ugandans, as security advisor last year. He is a former
army commander and fought in Museveni's 5-year bush war that ended
in 1996.
	   ------
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ More than half of the people who
tested HIV-positive in Swaziland were between age 10 and 24, a
report released Monday said.
	   Only 8 percent who tested positive for the immune deficiency
disease said they or their partners used condoms regularly.
Thirty-seven percent said they never used condoms.
	   More than three-quarters of HIV sufferers admitted to having sex
outside marriage, many with multiple partners, according to the
report released in conjunction with World AIDS Day last week.
	   About two-thirds of the 33 million people worldwide who are
infected with the HIV virus that causes AIDS live south of the
Sahara. An estimated two million people will die of the disease in
sub-Saharan Africa this year, four times the total for the rest of
the world.
	   HIV infection rates in Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe
hover between 20 percent and 25 percent of the adult population,
the United Nations said last month.
	   Swaziland is a kingdom of 1 million people sandwiched between
South Africa and Mozambique.
	   -----
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ A Swazi prince on Monday complained
about attempts by its neighbor, South Africa, to clamp down on
pension fraud by citizens of this tiny country of 1 million.
	   South Africa has arrested dozens of Swazi citizens for slipping
across the border and drawing out South African pension payments.
	   Prince Khuzulwandle, in a statement published in the Times of
Swaziland, said the pensioners were simply reclaiming what was
rightfully theirs.
	   The prince, who is chairman of the border adjustment committee,
charged that South Africa under apartheid had stolen vast stretches
of land from the people of Swaziland.
	   All Swazis who lived in the disputed areas were entitled to
pensions paid to people living in that area, he said.
	   Swaziland, a former British protectorate that gained
independence in 1968, would continue fighting for the return of the
disputed land from South Africa, the prince said.

Hong Kong's Fu becomes second favorite to tumble

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Hong Kong's Marco Fu Ka-Chun joined
Thailand's James Wattana as a high-profile casualty when he was
eliminated from the Asian Games snooker tournament Monday.
	   Fu was beaten 5-3 by Malaysia's Ooi Chin Kay a day after former
world No. 3 Wattana lost 5-1 to Hong Kong's Chan Kwok Ming.
	   Chan and Ooi maintained their good form Monday. Chan
steamrollered Japan's Shinya Egashira 5-0 in the round of 16 match
and advanced to the semifinals with a 5-2 victory against Mohamed
Alhashemi of the United Arab Emirates. Ooi also made the semis,
beating UAE opponent Mohamed Aljokar 5-2.
	   Ooi's hard-fought 5-3 victory over Fu elicited a rare burst of
cheers from the crowd, which otherwise greeted good shots with
brief polite applause.
	   Ooi said later he thought he and his opponent both were not at
their best, choosing instead to play a cautious game with a lot of
saving.
	   He described Fu, the only player to hold the world senior and
junior amateur titles concurrently, as ``very good and very calm.''
	   ``He is a world class player and I used all my experience to
beat him,'' Ooi said.
	   Chan said he did not feel he played up to his standard, but that
Egashira failed to pressure him.
	   A second Malaysian joined Ooi in the semis. Sam Chong beat Hung
Chung-ming of Taiwan 5-2 in the round of 16 and then outlasted
India's Yashin Merchant 5-4 in a night match lasting 3 hours, 10
minutes.
	   Pakistan's Ali Shokat was the fourth man through to the semis
with a 5-2 win against Keith E Boon Aun of Singapore.

Despite internal struggles, EU remains upbeat on expansion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details; TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The EU foreign ministers struggled
Monday to keep the European Union's expansion drive alive, trying
to sound welcoming to newcomers without committing themselves to
specific entry dates.
	   Hampering the EU is discord on how to fund a near-doubling of
the ranks and how fast to expand the union, issues that will
dominate a two-day summit opening Friday in Vienna.
	   Even so, the foreign ministers planned to send the European
leaders an upbeat report, declaring that efforts to bring Cyprus,
10 East European nations and possibly Malta into the EU in the next
decade are well on track.
	   Negotiations opened this fall with Cyprus, Hungary, Poland, the
Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia and preliminary talks with
slower-track candidates Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and
Bulgaria.
	   The EU refuses to set firm entry dates just to ensure that
candidates keep up their reform efforts to get in shape for
membership.
	   The first newcomers won't join until 2004 or 2005.
	   Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are expected to get in
first. The Netherlands, Germany, France and Italy have second
thoughts about admitting a divided Cyprus.
	   Germany and France oppose accelerating talks with Lithuania,
Latvia and Slovakia _ slow-trackers which the EU head office says
are doing better than expected in getting ready for membership.
	   But predictably, the EU's Scandinavian members _ Sweden, Denmark
and Finland _ welcomed the suggestion.
	   On Monday, Greece objected to Turkey being mentioned in the
enlargement report that will be sent to the summit. The EU has
snubbed Turkey as a candidate, citing its dubious human rights
record, but wants to keep the door ajar to future talks.
	   Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden and France insisted
that ahead of enlargement, the EU must get a grip on spending.
	   They want the EU budget to rise until 2006 only in line with
inflation from this year's level of 86 billion European currency
units (dlrs 100 billion).
	   The European Commission has proposed to link EU spending to
economic growth, adding some 20 billion ecu (dlrs 23.6 billion) to
the budget by 2006.
	   Spain and other southerners are holding out for increased
membership fees, fearful that they will lose special aid deals once
even poorer easterners come into the EU.
	   Germany and other northern members say they already pay far more
into the EU than they get back and want to limit their net
contributions. Germany's net payment is 22 billion marks (dlrs 13
billion) a year.
	   Complicating the money debate is Britain's refusal to give up an
annual rebate which it has been getting since 1984.
	   Worth 2.6 billion pounds (dlrs 4 billion) this year, that rebate
was granted to offset London's net payment but its partners argue
that Britain is much better off now than 14 years ago.

NATO foreign ministers to begin forging new strategy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Based on the lessons learned in Bosnia
and Kosovo, NATO foreign ministers on Tuesday begin forging a new
concept of strategy, expanding the traditional notion of collective
defense to include threats from weapons of mass destruction,
terrorism and regional conflicts.
	   This strategic concept, last revised in 1991, sets out the
military and political basis for NATO's mission. In reality,
however, the allies will merely fit into their guiding theory the
kind of defense it has needed since the fall of the Berlin wall a
decade ago.
	   ``NATO's primary mission will always remain defense against
aggression,'' U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright wrote
Monday in Britain's Financial Times. ``But the founders of the
alliance also distinguished between what the treaty commits us to
do and what it permits us to do.''
	   Today's threat is not a Russian tank assault across the plains
of Central Europe, but security challenges from regional conflicts
and ethnic violence like in Bosnia and Kosovo, terrorism and the
spread of weapons of mass destruction. When these threats originate
from outside NATO's traditional territory of operations, the
alliance must be prepared to deal with them.
	   ``The challenge is to bring the strategy into line with the
changing reality,'' said a senior NATO diplomat briefing reporters
before the NATO foreign ministers' meeting here Tuesday and
Wednesday.
	   The ministers will be making preparations for the NATO summit
April 24-25. Principal issues at that summit will be approval of
the new strategic concept and the welcoming of three new members,
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, as well as celebrating the
alliance's 50th birthday.
	   Albright will table a proposal at the ministerial meeting here
to set up a Center for Weapons of Mass Destruction, essentially an
intelligence-sharing center to provide greater coherence among the
allies in how this issue is assessed and addressed, officials said.
	   The plan would use existing NATO staff under a single director,
with perhaps a few additional experts, they said.
	   The Germans seem certain to bring up the nuclear first-strike
question.
	   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer made waves when he
called on NATO last month to consider dropping its doctrine
allowing a nuclear first-strike. This doctrine, reaffirmed as
recently as last year, has always been a part of NATO's nuclear
strategy and is considered an important aspect of deterrence.
	   ``The minister will certainly raise the issue,'' a German
diplomatic source said. ``We have to see that in the context of
arms control, arms reduction and nonproliferation.''
	   The Germans don't have much backing on the issue and no one at
NATO sees it as more than a speed bump on the road to the new
strategic concept.
	   The allies will assess the situation in Kosovo, the poor
southern province of Serbia where Serb security forces and ethnic
Albanian guerrillas clashed for seven months. The threat of a NATO
airstrike stopped the fighting in October and the cease-fire is
generally holding, despite sporadic outbursts.
	   The ministers also will make their six-monthly review of the
situation in Bosnia. While there may be some cosmetic changes in
the 32,000-member NATO-led force in Bosnia, no major reduction in
the troop level is seen any time soon.
	   ``Bosnia and Kosovo are recent examples that demonstrate NATO
must act when conflicts beyond its immediate borders affect
alliance interests,'' Albright wrote in her Financial Times
article. ``NATO must find the right balance between the centrality
of NATO's collective defense missions and responding to such
crises.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. Marine forces have been conducting land
and sea maneuvers for the past week and a half in Israel's Negev
desert, a spokesman said Monday.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz said that the training
exercises were routine under U.S.-Israel security agreements,
adding that Israel was one of the few countries in the region that
allowed U.S. Marines to train on its soil.
	   Schwartz said the Marines were conducting the exercises alone
and that the fleet would return to sea before U.S. President Bill
Clinton's visit to the region Saturday.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's sympathizers on the U.N. Security
Council got the biggest trade deals under the fourth phase of the
U.N.-approved oil-for-food program, according to U.N. figures.
	   Iraq's trade with Russia, France and China made up more than
one-third of total imports under the fourth phase, which ended Nov.
25, the figures showed.
	   The three countries have urged an early lifting of the trade
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The
oil-for-food program, an exception to the sanctions, allows Iraq to
sell limited quantities of oil to buy needed food and medicine.
	   Russia was the top trading partner, selling goods worth dlrs
272.7 million, the report said. France was second with a total of
dlrs 185.9, followed by China at dlrs 139.4 million.
	   Other top trading partners were Vietnam, Jordan and Australia,
which each shipped about dlrs 90 million worth of goods.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A pre-dawn fire Monday gutted a retirement home
that just a week ago failed a safety inspection, killing 10 people
and injuring 25 others, about a dozen of them seriously, officials
said.
	   Seven people were killed during the blaze, but three others died
later in hospitals, according to the mayor's office in suburban
Livry-Gargan where the home is located.
	   Three other people died in a second overnight blaze in a Paris
apartment house.
	   The head of the rescue service, Commander Jean-Luc Chivot, said
the retirement home failed to pass a Dec. 1 inspection.
	   Among other things, the safety commission found wanting
emergency facilities that would help rescue workers in the event of
a disaster, Chivot said on France-3 television.
	   About 140 firefighters fought the 4 a.m. (0300 GMT) blaze that
officials said began in a ground-floor room and spread up the
elevator shaft over three floors.
	   Chivot estimated that the fire had been burning a half-hour
before rescue workers received an alert.
	   He said some 40 people of the approximately 80 people in the
home, located in the northern working-class area of
Seine-Seine-Denis, were evacuated by ladder.
	   ``We were able to get them out fast,'' he said, ``Otherwise, the
death toll would have been higher.''

Clashes over prisoners continue; hunger strikes expands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two Palestinians injured, one critically &QL; 
 &UR; By DANA BUDEIRI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Clashes over the release of
Palestinian prisoners spread Monday throughout the West Bank,
critically injuring one Palestinian, and a prisoners' group said
its hunger strike would continue until Israel releases all the
prisoners.
	   The Palestinian Prisoners Association urged Palestinians to
stage an ``intefadeh'' _ or uprising _ until all Palestinian
prisoners are released, Palestinian legislator Fares Kadoura told
protesters in the Palestinian-controlled town of Ramallah.
	   ``The Palestinians in Israeli jails announce that our revolution
has started,'' Kadoura said, reading from a statement.
	   Israel released 250 Palestinian prisoners last month out of 750
promised it the U.S.-brokered Wye River accords, signed in October.
	   Palestinians are angry that most of those released were accused
of common crimes and want Israel to release ``security prisoners''
_ those detained without trial under prevention of terror measures.
	   Kadoura, who is a member of the team negotiating the prisoners
release with Israel, said that a hunger strike begun last week by
hundreds of prisoners had now spread to all four Israeli jails and
among all 3,000 Palestinian prisoners.
	   Prisons Authority spokeswoman Orit Messer-Harel said she knew of
only 514 prisoners striking at two prisons since Friday. There had
been no health problems so far, she said.
	   Israel would not heed the protests, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said.
	   ``They want to impose on Israel to release murderers,'' he said
on a tour of an archaeological dig in Jerusalem's Old City. ``I
don't free murderers.''
	   He did not address demands for the release of others not accused
of being involved in killings, including members of banned militant
groups.
	   In recent weeks, Israel and the Palestinians have accused one
another of failing to live up to various provisions, and Israel has
threatened to hold off on a scheduled Dec. 18 troop pullback. That
could poison next week's planned visit to the region.
	   Clashes took place in at least five West Bank locations,
including some controlled by the Palestinian Authority. Most
injuries were minor.
	   Stone-throwing protesters ambushed Israeli vehicles in Abu Dis,
a village east of Jerusalem. One Israeli in a pickup truck fired on
the protesters, wounding two of them.
	   Nasr Erekat, 17, was critically injured from head wounds,
hospital officials said. Another Palestinian was injured in the
thigh.

Virenque says he will quit cycling over doping scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new quotes, details, background; Editing thruout
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Still maintaining that he never took banned drugs,
Richard Virenque says he will quit cycling because the doping
scandals overshadowing the sport are preventing him from finding a
new team.
	   Virenque, 29, has been unable to find a team since last month's
decision by Festina to break with the cyclist.
	   Late Sunday, he issued a statement saying that he would be
quitting the sport.
	   ``He (Virenque) has the impression that he is leaving a job
unfinished and he wants to apologize to his supporters. He would
like to keep making them dream, but it is not possible anymore,''
said the statement by Virenque, issued in the third person.
	   Since joining Festina in 1994, Virenque placed third in the 1996
Tour de France and second the following year.
	   He was king of the mountain legs in the classic race for four
consecutive years, between 1994 and 1997.
	   But Festina fell into disgrace this year when its masseur, Willy
Voet, was arrested driving a team car loaded with banned drugs just
before the start of the Tour de France.
	   Team officials later revealed to investigators what they said
was systematic use of banned drugs within the team.
	   Three Festina officials are under formal investigation, one step
short of being charged: Voet; team doctor Eric Ryckaert; and
sporting director Bruno Roussel.
	   But Virenque remains one of two Festina cyclists that continue
to deny the charge -- a move which has alienated him from both the
Festina team and cyclists.
	   In November, Festina said that it would not renew its contract
with Virenque which expires at the end of this month, citing the
doping scandal and Virenque's refusal to accept a 75-percent salary
cut.
	   Pressure on Virenque grew last week with the publication of a
judicial report that suggested he too took banned substances.
	   Voet, who has continued to accuse Virenque of taking drugs, said
he was disappointed at Virenque's decision.
	   ``If we get to a situation where a cyclist must stop his career
because he has taken doping substances, then there are masses who
must stop their career, because there is a problem in the system,''
Voet said on TF1 television.
	   But colleagues said that Virenque's position was becoming
unbearable.
	   ``You can't beat a whole army of journalists who only want one
thing, for him to stop,'' his wife Stephanie Virenque told Europe 1
radio. ``Today, we are unfortunately obliged to tell them that they
have won.''
	   But she added that if another team were to offer Virenque a
contract, he would be back in the saddle.
	   ``He would go, because cycling is his life's goal,'' she said.
``We still have a small hope that for Christmas there will be a
team that has confidence in him and reaches out when everyone else
is turning their back.''

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, reflecting
growing Israeli unease over an upcoming visit by U.S. President
Bill Clinton, suggested Monday that the trip was entirely Clinton's
initiative.
	   ``What am I going to tell him, not to come _ don't come? I can
prevent him from coming?'' Netanyahu asked rhetorically in an
interview on army radio. ``We're not accustomed to refusing someone
who wants to come.''
	   In another sign of tensions arising from the trip, the speaker
of Israel's parliament, Dan Tichon, said he intended to boycott
events with Clinton because the president did not plan to address
the Knesset.
	   Clinton's visit to Israel, which begins Saturday, is to be
coupled with a stop in the Gaza Strip, the first by a sitting U.S.
president.
	   The United States has repeatedly said the trip is not intended
as an endorsement of Palestinian aspirations for statehood, but the
Palestinians see it as a powerful boost to their sovereignty hopes.
	   Speaking Monday to reporters in Gaza, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat hailed Clinton's trip as ``historic and great.''
	   The presidential visit to Israel and the Palestinian lands is
meant to encourage both sides to stick to the timetable set out in
the Wye River peace accords signed in October.
	   However, Netanyahu said Clinton's trip ``has value only if he
strengthens the Palestinian fulfillment of their obligations''
under the agreement.
	   In recent weeks, Israel and the Palestinians have accused one
another of failing to live up to various provisions, and Israel has
threatened to hold off on a scheduled Dec. 18 troop pullback.
	   Palestinians are angry over stepped-up Jewish settlement
activity in the West Bank and Israel's failure to free hundreds of
prisoners jailed for anti-Israel activity.
	   Israel released the first 250 of a promised 750 Palestinian
prisoners last month, but they were mainly criminals, not so-called
security prisoners as the Palestinians have demanded.
	   In response, Palestinians have staged protests that have
repeatedly boiled over into violent street clashes. More
demonstrations took place today in several West Bank towns. Two
Palestinians were injured, one of them critically, when an Israeli
civilian opened fire after his car was ambushed by stonethrowers in
a West Bank area near Jerusalem.
	   The controversy over Clinton's visit comes as Netanyahu is
trying to quell a potential parliamentary rebellion. Opposition
from within his coalition to Israel's ceding of West Bank land has
forced Netanyahu to seek new allies to prop up his government. A
vote on early elections was possible later Monday.
	   Netanyahu has been sparring publicly with his former foreign
minister, David Levy, who considered rejoining the shaky governing
coalition in exchange for the finance minister's job.
	   The prime minister said the two couldn't agree on economic
principles and that he wouldn't sacrifice Israel's economy to
coalition politics.
	   Levy's spokesman said today that he would not renew negotiations
with Netanyahu and would support early elections. ``It's final,''
Alon Amron said.
	   The Clinton visit has exacerbated tensions within the
government. At Sunday's Israeli Cabinet meeting, a shouting match
erupted over it, according to Israel radio.
	   ``Who invited President Clinton to the Gaza Strip?'' Silvan
Shalom, the science minister, reportedly yelled at Netanyahu.
Netanyahu said it had been Clinton's idea, not his.
	   In Gaza, Clinton is to attend a meeting at which Palestinians
will reaffirm the nullification of clauses in their national
charter calling for Israel's destruction.

Formula One faces probes and bans in Belgium
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Tax officials are investigating the
financing of the Spa-Francorchamps Grand Prix, compounding the
Belgian problems of Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone, who is
already facing a tobacco advertising ban and a European Union
antitrust probe.
	   Officials said Monday Belgium's special tax investigation unit
is looking into the account of the company running the track and
payments to the promotion company of the Belgian Grand Prix, which
is run by Ecclestone's wife Slavica Malic.
	   For 1993 alone, investigators are looking for over 7 million
francs (dlrs 200,000) in due taxes and fines, said Joseph Moxhet,
chairman of the company running the Spa-Francorchamps circuit. Some
media reports put the figure much higher.
	   ``It sure comes at a bad moment,'' said Andre Maes, secretary
general of the Spa-Francorchamps circuit, noting the FIA world
automobile association was to rule on next year's calendar on
Thursday or Friday. The Belgian Grand Prix is penciled in on the
provisional schedule but Maes realizes this could change quickly.
	   ``We have had no contact with FIA about this. This goes over our
head,'' Maes said.
	   The Belgian Grand Prix is one of the most attractive weekends of
the Formula One circuit. Drivers consider the sweeping curves and
the undulating 6.9-kilometer (4.3-mile) track that cuts through the
dense Ardennes forest, the best in the world.
	   Maes already has been at the forefront of a battle to keep
tobacco advertising on his circuit despite the prospect of a
stringent Belgian ban, due to come into operation Jan. 1. Cigarette
ads are an economic lifeline for Formula One and Ecclestone has
threatened to pull races where tough anti-tobacco laws are in
place.
	   On Wednesday, the Wallonia regional legislature in southern
Belgium, where the Spa-Francorchamps circuit is located, will vote
to force through local derogations to the anti-tobacco law.
	   The Walloon government argues the national ban violates its
regional autonomy rights. The Belgian law goes beyond European
Union legislation which will phase out tobacco ads over a 10-year
period.
	   The loss of the Belgian Formula One race would have serious
economic consequences for the Spa region, which draws an estimated
dlrs 30 million from the Grand Prix weekend in late August alone.
	   Ecclestone is also under pressure from the Brussels-based
European Commission. Over the past weeks, the dispute between the
two has intensified after FIA said that Brussels has no right to
interfere in its contracts with Formula One Administration Ltd.
	   European Commission antitrust officials, headed by competition
commissioner Karel van Miert, are pushing ahead with an inquiry
into the running of Formula One racing to ensure it complies with
EU fair-trading rules.
	   The Commission is expected to rule on the issue next year, and
its decision could well affect Ecclestone's plans to launch a dlrs
2 billion bond issue.

Tehran paper reports disappearance of Iranian intellectual
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian writer left his home last week
and has not been heard from since, adding to a recent spate of
mysterious disappearances, a Tehran newspaper reported Monday.
	   Mohammed Mokhtari, a poet and member of the Association of
Iranian writers, left to go shopping Thursday in the residential
suburb in northern Tehran, the Zan newspaper said. It said
Mokhtari's family searched hospitals, morgues and police stations
but could not find him.
	   Increasingly, hard-line rivals of President Mohammad Khatami are
resorting to violence to deal with opponents. Over the past year,
vigilantes have attacked dissidents, liberal newspapers and even a
reformist Cabinet minister.
	   None of the incidents has resulted in arrests, leading to
suspicions the assailants are backed by powerful hard-line clerics
like spiritual leader Ali Khamenei and Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi,
the head of the judiciary.
	   Last month, the head of an Iranian opposition group, Dariush
Foruhar, and his wife Parvaneh were stabbed to death in their home.
	   Police said they've made several arrests in the murders of the
Foruhars, after President Mohammad Khatami condemned the killings
and ordered an investigation. So far, the findings have not been
made public.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's tiny Liu Xiuhua set a world
record with a snatch of 83.5 kilograms Monday on her way to the
Asian Games gold medal for 48-kilogram division women's
weightlifting.
	   Compatriot Lan Shizhang won in the men's 56-kilogram division,
but his gold medal total of 275.0 kilograms fell far short of his
Asian record of 295.0.
	   Liu won with a total of 187.5. Myammar's Kay Thi Win took the
silver with 182.5 and Indonesia's Sri Indriyani the bronze with
180.
	   Liu started with a lift of 80 kilograms in the snatch, and under
the rules, her next lift should have been 2.5 kilograms heavier.
	   She chose instead to go for 83.5 to break the world mark of 83.0
set by China's Li Zhuo on Sept. 16. She succeeded on her second
try.
	   In the total, however, she was credited with only the 82.5 she
was supposed to have tried next.
	   ``I am happy at last even though I should have done better in
clean and jerk,'' she said through an interpreter.
	   Her best at that specialty was 105. She failed at 115.
	   Lan, also a gold medalist in the 1994 games, had a snatch of
120.0 and a clean and jerk of 155.0 as he finished 7.5 kilograms
ahead of Taiwan's Wang Shin-yuan and Iran's Seyed-Mahdi Panzvan.
Wang took the silver because of his lighter body weight.
	   Lan was behind after the snatch, in which Panzvan lifted 122.5.
In the clean and jerk, Panzvan lifted only 145.0, letting Wang go
ahead with 152.5.

Armenia mourns 1988 quake victims

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ All offices and factories were closed
across Armenia on Monday to mourn the 25,000 people killed in a
monster earthquake 10 years ago.
	   At 11:41 a.m. _ the time the 1988 quake had hit _ a minute of
silence was observed throughout the former Soviet republic.
	   President Robert Kocharian traveled to the towns of Spitak and
Gyumri, formerly Leninakan, where virtually every house was
destroyed by the magnitude 6.9 quake. In Spitak, 4,003 people were
killed.
	   Armenian leaders and ambassadors from all countries with
representatives in Armenia laid wreaths at the graves of 88
schoolchildren from the village of Dzhararat, 3 kilometers south of
Spitak, who were in class when their school building collapsed,
burying them under rubble.
	   ``Many countries, international charity organizations and
individuals, our Armenian Diaspora with pain in their hearts
responded to the disaster and offered their help,'' Kocharian said
in a statement released by his office Monday.
	   ``We continue to receive it even now. And though 10 years have
passed, we still feel that we need it.''
	   More than a million Armenians are estimated to live outside
Armenia, many in the United States, and many donated aid for
earthquake victims.
	   Armenia is embroiled in a bitter ethnic conflict with adjacent
Azerbaijan, which has imposed an economic blockade against and
blocked railroads to its neighboring Caucasus Mountains nation.
	   With international aid, some housing has been built for the
700,000 people who lost their homes in the quake.
	   On Monday five more two-story apartment buildings were declared
ready for people to move in. A poster hung on one of the houses
read: ``10 years of suffering, revival and faith.''
	   The quake rattled 40 percent of Armenia's territory, where 1
million people lived. Twenty-one towns and 324 villages were ruined
or heavily damaged.
	   Then-Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev cut short a summit with
U.S. President Ronald Reagan in New York to return to the Soviet
Union after the quake.
	   On Sunday, Kocharian honored 40 people who were active in
restoration work. Among them was an American from Utah, John
Huntsman, who has built a construction factory and made major
investments in Armenia's construction industry.
	   Huntsman was decorated with St. Mesrop Mashtots medal, Armenia's
highest civilian award.

Lung cancer sufferers' law suit begins in London
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Preliminary hearings opened at the High Court
Monday in a case which lung cancer sufferers hope will be Britain's
first class action law suit against tobacco companies.
	   Attorney Brian Langstaff is bringing eight test cases to seek a
judgment on whether 36 of the cancer sufferers who were longtime
smokers are too late to take legal action.
	   Under English law, most personal injury claims have to be lodged
within three years, although a judge can use discretion.
	   The remainder of the 52 cancer sufferers in the suit against
Imperial Tobacco Ltd. and Gallaher Ltd. are within the three-year
time limit.
	   Although tobacco lawsuits have been fought for years in the
United States, the law is not tested in Britain.
	   Attorneys for the cancer patients are fighting the case under a
1995 law that allows lawyers to handle ``group action'' cases,
similar to class-action lawsuits in America, without charging
unless they win.
	   Langstaff told Judge Michael Wright that his eight clients had
suffered injury because the cigarettes they bought between the
1950s and 1970s contained more tar than was reasonably safe or
appropriate.
	   Under English law, companies have to minimize risk to people
from their actions.
	   Attorney Martyn Day argued that he can show that Imperial
Tobacco and Gallaher, who control 40 percent of Britain's tobacco
market, were negligent by reducing tar levels in cigarettes too
slowly through the years.
	   If the cancer victims win, thousands more who become sick each
year could go to court with strong chances to succeed.
	   Day has estimated some 20,000 of the 35,000 people who get lung
cancer every year in Britain could collect awards of 50,000 pounds
(dlrs 80,000) each. That comes to 1 billion pounds (dlrs 1.6
billion), more than the two tobacco companies' annual profits of
900 million pounds (dlrs 1.44 billion).
	   The current hearing is expected two weeks.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police on Monday arrested a man
suspected of helping plan August's car bombing of the town of
Omagh, Northern Ireland's deadliest-ever terrorist strike that left
29 dead.
	   Detectives said they found a Kalashnikov assault rifle, a
handgun, ammunition and a substantial cache of bomb-making
components in a raid on the 42-year-old man's home in Dundalk, a
border town in the Irish Republic 50 miles (80 kms) south of
Belfast.
	   Police in both parts of Ireland have already arrested but
released without charge more than 40 people suspected of belonging
to the Irish Republican Army dissident gang that carried out the
Aug. 15 attack. However, none of those suspects was caught in
possession of weaponry.
	   The dissidents, who oppose the IRA's July 1997 cease-fire and
refuse to call themselves by a different name, were dubbed the Real
IRA by Irish media. They called a truce in September in response to
public horror over Omagh.
	   The arrest came as leaders of all eight Northern Irish parties
that supported April's peace accord gathered in the United States
to receive two joint peace awards.
	   Among the leaders are Protestant politician David Trimble and
Catholic politician John Hume, who on Thursday will share the Nobel
Peace Prize at a ceremony in Oslo, Norway.
	   But in a symbol of how far apart Northern Ireland's key
peacemakers remain, Trimble decided not to attend the first awards
ceremony Monday at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, where
Sen. Edward Kennedy was expected to greet the other seven leaders.
	   Trimble's spokeswoman in Washington, Anne Smith, said he was
staying in the capital for private engagements and had prerecorded
a video ``thank you'' for the Boston event.
	   On Tuesday, all eight have been invited for lunch at the British
embassy in Washington before they receive a joint accolade from the
National Democratic Institute.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ He compressed car wrecks, blue jeans, vegetable
crates - even fake Cartier watches - and turned them into art
prized by museums and collectors worldwide.
	   Cesar Baldaccini, the immigrant son of a cleaning lady who
became one of France's leading contemporary sculptors died Sunday
of cancer at his Paris home.
	   Cesar, as he was known, was famous for giving the French cinema
stars the coveted golden statue of excellence, the U.S. equivalent
of the Oscar. The award, first given in 1976, is called the Cesar.
	   A high-profile bon vivant on the Paris celebrity scene, Cesar
was best-known for squashing, expanding and molding the discarded
scraps of 20th century life.
	   ``Cesar has incarnated sculpture at its highest level since the
late 1950s,'' Culture Minister Catherine Trautmann said. His art,
she said, oogave us a new definition of modernity.''
	   President Jacques Chirac praised Cesar's ``strength, capacity
for renewal and force of his creative ideas.''
	   Despite the official accolades, Cesar was sometimes snubbed by
the art establishment which had criticized him in recent years for
selling out to commercial interest.
	   His famed ``Thumb'' - a reproduction of his own thumb and finger
prints - today is available in every size for every budget. One
version at La Defense corporate park outside Paris is 12 meters
high (about 40 feet).
	   ``The French estabishment always has trouble with commercial
success,'' said art critic Ann Cremin. ``Cesar was a life force.
Where ever he was there was a buzz. People gravitated to him, yet
he refused to take himself seriously.''
	   Cremin recalled how Cesar once agreed to compact the wreckage of
a friend after a serious accident. The friend now displays the
sculpture of the near-miss in his Paris living room.
	   ``He's France's Andy Warhol,'' she said.
	   Born Jan. 1, 1921 in Marseille, the son of Italian immigrants,
Cesar earned pocket money making sausage for the family butcher. He
quit school at 12, but went on to study art in Marseille and Paris.
	   Too poor to afford clay, Cesar would rummage through city dumps
for scrap metal to recyle into art.
	   A member of the New Realism movement, Cesar ``sculpted'' other
objects by striking them with a sledgehammer: bicycles, vegetable
crates, coffee pots. He once compacted thousands of fake Cartier
tank watches seized by French customs officials.
	   He also made a giant breast cast from the bosom of a dancer at
the Crazy Horse cabaret.
	   As Cesar himself put it: ``I'm not an intellectual. I like to
touch. It's my hands that make my head work.''
	   The funeral was scheduled for Thursday in Paris at the
Saint-Germain-des-Pres Church to be followed by burial at the
Montparnasse cemetery.

Muslim region in Russia reinstates bride-prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Religious authorities in a largely Muslim region
in southern Russia have reinstated an ancient practice that
requires men to pay a woman's parents for the right to marry her, a
news report said Monday.
	   The bride-price has been set at 2,000 rubles (about 100
dollars), the ITAR-Tass news agency reported _ a significant amount
in the impoverished, restive region of Ingushetia.
	   The money must be handed over on the wedding day, and later the
husband must also provide two sets of bed linen and two sets of
clothing _ summer and winter _ for his wife.
	   Violators will be punished by being shunned by other residents
in their town or village, the report said.
	   While the practice has not been codified as a law, few
apparently dare to disobey it. Ingushetia has seen a steady
increase in the number of bachelors because many men cannot afford
to pay the 2,000 rubles, ITAR-Tass reported.

Yeltsin fires key aides during a brief break from hospital

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin roused himself from his
sickbed for three hours Monday, fired several of his top aides and
then returned to a Kremlin hospital where he is recuperating from
pneumonia.
	   It was a classic performance from the ailing president, who
rarely seems so energized as when he is firing someone. The
dismissed aides included officials who had commented recently on
the president's poor health.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin told his staff as he
delivered the news, according to presidential spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin.
	   Among those fired was Presidential Chief of Staff Valentin
Yumashev, one of Yeltsin's closest and most loyal aides. A former
journalist who was the ghost-writer of Yeltsin's memoirs, Yumashev
had served as chief of staff for nearly two years _ an eternity in
Yeltsin's Kremlin.
	   ``The president has found a way to revitalize his staff _ by
firing it,'' observed Alexander Shokhin, leader of the
pro-government bloc in parliament and, until recently, a steady
Yeltsin ally.
	   Shown on television, Yeltsin appeared animated and robust as he
scowled and delivered one of his patented tirades.
	   ``Tough discipline, order and reform is what we need,'' Yeltsin
said slowly and sternly as he glared at his staff from the head of
a long table. Aides looked down and busied themselves scribbling
notes.
	   Besides firing Yumashev and three of his deputies, Yeltsin
announced that he was personally taking charge of ``all power
ministries ... including the Justice Ministry and the tax police.''
	   ``Power ministries'' are usually defined as those related to
national defense and security. The Justice Ministry and tax police
are at the forefront of the fight against crime and corruption,
which has taken on new importance following the killing of a top
liberal leader, Galina Starovoitova.
	   Yeltsin's announcement was seen as mostly symbolic, however,
since the president already wields authority over all the
ministries included in his statement, and the ministers who head
them were left in place.
	   His remarks mostly suggested that Yeltsin is tired of being
portrayed as a figurehead who has relinquished all power to his
prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Primakov, appointed in September, has been left to
single-handedly tackle the economic crisis that has mired the
country deeper in poverty. Yeltsin has said little and done less
about the economy in the months since it went into a tailspin in
August.
	   There has been a rising chorus of calls for the president's
resignation, based on his poor health, but Yeltsin has been
defiant, insisting that he will fill out his term until it ends in
2000.
	   Yeltsin has been hospitalized with pneumonia since Nov. 22, and
Yakushkin said he would remain in the hospital as long as necessary
to recuperate. He refused to speculate about how long that would
be.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff, while the
other posts remained vacant. Bordyuzha, who will keep his security
job, was formerly chief of the Border Guards.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin had dismissed the aides because of their
failure to stem crime or respond to several incidents of political
extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist parliament
deputy.
	   ``That undermines confidence in the president and in the
government as a whole, and that is inadmissible in the current
difficult economic situation,'' Yakushkin said.
	   Yeltsin has a habit of unexpected and often unexplained
dismissals. The latest round of ousters was also thought to reflect
his unhappiness over aides' unusual candidness about his health in
recent weeks.
	   Yumashev and other Kremlin aides openly said that Yeltsin is too
weak to handle day-to-day affairs or to make foreign trips and
suggested he leave control of the economy and other current affairs
to Primakov.
	   ``The president wanted to show who is the boss,'' said Shokhin.
``He's like a lion who licked his wounds and now roared at those
who thought he was already out of the game.''

Nakamura has gold rush
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Olympic silver medalist Yukimasa
Nakamura didn't want to stick around for a fight Monday, wrapping
up an Asian Games judo gold medal in just 70 seconds.
	   Nakamura, one of three brothers on the Japanese judo team,
scored a clean ippon victory over Kazakstan's Ivan Baglayev in the
half lightweight division.
	   Nakamura defended the Asian Games title he won four years ago in
Hiroshima and is focussed on improving his Olympic silver to a gold
at the Sydney 2000 games.
	   ``I want this win to be a springboard for me ahead of Sydney,''
Nakamura said. ``It was good to execute my strategy the way I
planned.''
	   At extra lightweight, Kazuhiko Tokuno needed 4 minutes, 53
seconds to finish China's Yang Bo, twisting his opponent to the
mat.
	   In the women's extra lightweight class, Tomoe Makabe overcame
North Korea's Cha Hyon Hyang on a referee's decision.
	   Nakamura's brothers Yoshio and Kenzo will also compete at the
games.

Poland denies change in Olympic plan means a joint bid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A Polish Olympic official denied Monday
that Zakopane's bid to host the 2006 Games had been changed into a
joint bid with neighboring Slovakia.
	   Janusz Tatera, secretary general of the Polish Olympic
Committee, was responding to rejection of a Polish-Slovak agreement
by Juan Antonio Samaranch, head of the International Olympic
Committee.
	   ``There was some kind of misunderstanding. Nobody's talking of a
joint bid,'' Tatera said in a telephone interview.
	   Both Zakopane in Poland and Poprad-Tatry in Slovakia are bidding
to host the 2006 Olympics. Other competitors are Sion, Switzerland;
Turin, Italy; a joint bid by Helsinki, Finland, and Lillehammer,
Norway; and Klagenfurt, Austria, making a three-country bid that
includes regions of Slovenia and Italy.
	   Environmental groups, intellectuals and some political leaders
have criticized the Polish bid, saying the construction and
alterations needed to stage the Olympics would permanently damage
the pristine Tatra mountains in violation of environmental laws.
	   Polish and Slovakian officials announced Sunday that if Zakopane
wins and cannot get permission to hold the downhill skiing in Tatra
National Park, the races would take place at Poprad.
	   ``Poland and Slovakia together? It's too late,'' Samaranch said
when asked about the agreement. ``We have six bids from Europe and
we will be meeting about it next week. Now to change the bids would
be too late.''
	   But Tatera said the agreement announced Sunday would only
involve cooperation, rather than a joint candidacy. He said if
Zakopane wins the bid, it can still make changes concerning the
venue of particular events.
	   Poland would hold the downhill skiing at Poprad only if the
Olympic committee fails to get permission to organize the racing on
the Polish side of the border, he said.
	   Much of the Zakopane area is in the Tatra National Park,
established in 1954 to protect plants and wildlife. It was
designated a natural reserve by the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization in 1992.
	   Tatra National Park includes Kasprowy Wierch, Poland's tallest
mountain for skiers at 6,557 feet. (1,998 meters) It has two
slopes, and park management has resisted calls to build more lifts,
saying it would damage the environment.
	   ``Nobody ever said there will be no permission from the national
park for the downhill'' in Zakopane, Tatera said. ``This is a
question of negotiations and compromise.''
	   Almost every Olympic city, such as Nagano earlier this year, has
similar environmental problems, Tatera said.

Rwanda says it will stay in Congo without security guarantees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Rwanda will maintain troops in neighboring
Congo in the absence of adequate security guarantees along its
border, Vice President Paul Kagame said.
	   Kagame, who is also minister of defense, said on Sunday Rwanda
would support any U.N.-brokered peace agreement which addresses
both the concerns of Congolese rebels fighting to overthrow
President Laurent Kabila and his country's own security concerns.
	   ``If we were given cast-iron guarantees by the international
community that our security concerns would be addressed, and Kabila
demonstrated a genuine commitment to address our security concerns,
then we would have no further need to keep our troops in Congo,''
Kagame told the British Broadcasting Corp.
	   Rwandan Hutu rebels use bases in eastern Congo to launch
cross-border attacks aimed at destabilizing the Rwandan government.
	   So far, peace initiatives to end Congo's four-month war have
failed over Kabila's refusal to negotiate directly with the
Congolese rebel coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disaffected Congolese
soldiers and opposition politicians.
	   He instead has demanded that Rwanda and Uganda, who are openly
supporting the Congolese rebels, withdraw their backing.
	   The conflict, which began Aug. 2, has drawn in Zimbabwe, Angola,
Namibia and Chad fighting in support of Kabila.
	   In a summit in Paris last month, Rwanda agreed with Uganda,
Zimbabwe and Congo to sign a cease-fire in Lusaka, Zambia on Dec.
14-15, but later added that any agreement will have to include the
rebels.
	   Kagame said his troops had intervened in Congo because Kabila
had recruited thousands of former Hutu soldiers and militiamen who
had fled Rwanda in fear of reprisals for a 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
	   ``The international community must understand that this is an
issue that affects our very exsistance as a nation and as a
people,'' he said.
	   More than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus
were slaughtered in the Hutu government-sponsored genocide before
Tutsi-led rebels won power in July 1994, sending the defeated Hutu
soldiers into what was then Zaire.
	   Many of them regrouped in bases in eastern Congo.
	   In 1996, Rwanda supported Kabila's rebels who ousted longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko but failed to rid the common border from
Hutu fighters.
	   ``Kabila and his allies will never be able to overrun eastern
Congo, that is impossible,'' Kagame said. ``They also cannot wish
away the problems they have created. They need to sit down and talk
to those fighting them.''

U.S. envoy denounces new Bosnian Serb president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IRENA GAJIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) - The U.S. envoy for Bosnia
on Monday denounced the new Bosnian Serb president, saying he has
been working against the 1995 Dayton accords that ended the Bosnian
war.
	   The statement by Robert Gelbard indicates Washington's
displeasure with the extreme-nationalist President Nikola Poplasen
and raised the possibility he might be replaced by the
international officials who effectively rule Bosnia under the
Dayton agreement.
	   ``We are deeply concerned about what we have seen so far from
President Poplasen and his short few weeks in office,'' Gelbard
said in Banja Luka after he met Poplasen and acting pro-Western
Bosnian Serb Premier Milorad Dodik.
	   Poplasen's ``actions and his words have shown us that he is
against the Dayton agreement,'' Gelbard told reporters. ``He
appears to be using democratic mechanism for antidemocratic
purposes.''
	   Poplasen, of the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party, won
presidential elections in the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia last
September over a moderate who was supported by Western peace
officials.
	   Poplasen's victory dealt a blow to international efforts to
cement peace, restart ethnic tolerance and impose democracy in
Bosnia after the 1995 agreement ended the 3-1/2 year war.
	   Polpasen's defiant anti-Western statements have prompted
speculations that he might be sacked by Bosnia's international
care-takers, as stipulated by the Dayton agreement which calls for
the removal of all those Bosnian officials who jeopardize the
U.S.-sponsored peace deal.
	   Gelbard said he hoped that Dodik's reformist government -- which
Poplasen is trying to remove by proposing a new premier close to
Bosnian Serb war-crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic -- ``will continue
in office because it has proved to be productive and positive
one.''
	   Gelbard denounced Poplasen for his effort to push the
Serb-controlled half of Bosnia closer to Serbia -- instead of
working toward a joint Bosnian state together with rival Muslims
and Croats -- by saying:
	   ``Serbia has collapsed and communist-type economy. Bosnian Serbs
are making progress in the opposite direction, trying to join the
rest of the world.''

Reactor shut down in Ukraine after long repairs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW 9th graf with president lashing out at energy officials &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A nuclear reactor that was restarted last
week at the Yuzhnaya nuclear power plant after lengthy delays was
automatically shut down Monday by its safety system, officials
said.
	   The shutdown was caused by an unexpected lack of electricity
feeding the reactor's control and safety equipment, said a
spokesman at the state Energoatom company, which runs Ukraine's
nuclear power plants.
	   Plant workers were studying the cause, which did not result in
any radiation leaks, the spokesman said.
	   Yuzhnaya's reactor No. 2 was shut down in June for routine
repairs and upgrades, and was supposed to be restarted in early
October. It returned to work in full only last Friday.
	   Yuzhnaya, Ukraine's second-largest plant, is located in
Yuzhnoukrainsk, 280 kilometers (170 miles) south of the capital
Kiev. It has three VVER-1000 reactors, which are considered more
reliable than Chernobyl-type RBMK reactors.
	   Monday's shutdown was bad news for Ukraine's already overloaded
and cash-strapped energy system, which is burdened by customer
debts and increased demand for energy during the winter.
	   Ukrainian energy plants are owed more than dlrs 1 billion by
consumers and have been working below capacity since October.
	   Energy Minister Oleksiy Sheberstov has warned that his ministry
would be forced to cut off electricity to entire regions if even
one nuclear reactor is stopped. The Cabinet has been working on a
list of enterprises that would be deprived of electricity if demand
becomes dangerously high.
	   On Monday, President Leonid Kuchma lashed out at top government
officials and Sheberstov's ministry for failing to improve the
energy situation, urging them to more carefully monitor energy
supplies. He also warned that he would hold energy sector leaders
personally responsible for continued problems, Kuchma's press
service said.
	   Meanwhile, officials at two other nuclear power plants said they
are planning to extend the repairs of two reactors until the end of
December, the independent UNIAN news agency said. The two reactors
were due to go on line Dec. 6 and Dec. 10, it said.
	   Ukraine's five nuclear power plants provide for more than 40
percent of the former Soviet republic's energy needs. At least 5 of
the 14 operational reactors are undergoing repairs.

South Korea beats Japan, Turkmenistan edges India in Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Kuwait and Uzbekistan scored big
victories Monday in the second round of Asian Games soccer, while
South Korea's veteran striker Choi Yong-soo scored two unanswered
goals against Japan in a clash of the 2002 World Cup co-hosts.
	   Uzbekistan beat North Korea 4-0 in Group 1 while Kuwait trounced
the United Arab Emirates 5-0 in Group 2 play. In other second round
action, two late goals from India were not enough to save it from a
3-2 loss to Turkmenistan in Group 1.
	   Bangkok's large South Korean community turned out in noisy
droves at the Rajamangala National Stadium, site of Monday's lavish
opening ceremonies, to watch their team, which is favored to win
the soccer competition.
	   Choi's goals, added to his four from the first round, were not
enough to put him on top as the competition's top scorer. That spot
is held by Kuwait's Jasem al-Huwaidi, who scored three second-half
goals against the overwhelmed Emirates, for his second hat trick of
the games and a goal total of eight.
	   Tiny oil-rich Kuwait increasingly looks like one of the top
favorites, having drubbed Mongolia 11-0 and drawn against a
determined Uzbekistan side, 3-3, in the first round.
	   In the loss to South Korea, midfielder Shunsuke Nakamura was one
of the few bright spots for Japan. He lofted a free kick over the
Korean wall about two meters in front of flailing keeper Kim
Byung-ji, which Masihiro Koga barely missed punching home. Japan
missed such chances to finish all afternoon.
	   Another loss Wednesday against Kuwait would all but rule out
Japan's chances of moving on to the next round and making a good
show of itself as a future World Cup host.
	   South Korea plays the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday in Group
2. The top two teams in the group will advance to the
quarterfinals, which is played on a straight knockout basis.
	   In their match against India, a first-half goal by Dmitriy
Nejelev and two other goals by Muslim Agaev and Igor Kislov had
Turkmenistan up 3-0 midway through the second half.
	   India got two back in the 37th and 40th minutes of the second
half through I.M. Vijayan and Tushar Rakshit, but was unable to
pull level before the final whistle.
	   Uzbekistan, which routed Mongolia 15-0 Saturday, had another
shutout with the help of two goals by Nikolai Shirshov. He gave his
team the lead with the only goal of the first half in the 16th
minute. Igor Shkvrin upped the count to 2-0 in the 55th minute
followed by a goal by Andrei Akopyrants five minutes later.
Shirshov finished the scoring in the 75th minute.
	   Turkmenistan faces North Korea on Wednesday in Group 1, while
India will take on Uzbekistan.

Angolan rebel group says government army still attacking, 10 dead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angolan government jets bombarded the
central highland strongholds of the rebel group UNITA on Monday,
for the fourth consecutive day, while infantry units supported by
tanks advanced by road, a UNITA spokesman said.
	   UNITA Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba Gato said at least 10
people were killed and about 50 were injured in the attacks which
appeared to end the southwest African country's fragile four-year
peace process.
	   The government has refused to say whether it is attacking the
rebel bases. However, the Defense Ministry will not let reporters
into the area because it says it is an ``operational zone.''
	   U.N. staff last week reported hearing bomb explosions in the
area.
	   Gato said MiG jets launched two strikes early Monday on Andulo
and Bailundo, rural towns about 290 kilometers (180 miles)
southeast of Luanda where the UNITA leadership lives.
	   UNITA troops supported by local militias had repelled a
government attack by road on Andulo while fighting around Bailundo,
150 kilometers (90 miles) to the west, was deadlocked, according to
Gato.
	   Gato, speaking by satellite telephone, said he was in Bailundo,
though it was not possible to confirm that.
	   The government and UNITA have engaged in skirmishes in rural
areas of this vast country in recent months, although both sides
refuse to admit responsibility for ending the peace accord.
	   Gato said UNITA still wanted to find a peaceful solution to the
conflict but accused President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who leads
the governing MPLA Party, of wanting to crush the group.
	   ``The peace agreement has effectively been buried by Dos Santos.
He has implicitly ended it,'' Gato said.
	   ``But we'll keep fighting back. There'll be no winner,'' he
said.
	   The 1994 U.N.-brokered peace pact, which ended a two-decade
civil war between the foes, has not advanced since June.
	   The government accuses UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ of keeping a
30,000-strong guerilla army hidden in the jungle.
	   UNITA has refused to relinquish control of its two last
strongholds, claiming that the government has committed human
rights abuses in areas already handed over.
	   A 1991 peace agreement collapsed the following year after UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi rejected his defeat in the country's first
democratic elections which were won by Dos Santos and his Popular
Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or MPLA.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   A strong middle- to upper-level trough of low pressure was
located over the northern Caribbean and southwest Atlantic this
morning and was drifting slowly southeast.
	   The trough is expected to drift across the northeast Caribbean
today and tonight. While the threat of rainfall will remain across
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin islands as it passes, the most

from remaining in any one place for very long.
	   Once the trough passes to the southeast, drier and more stable
air will move into the northeast Caribbean bringing a much-needed
drying period.
	   Surface winds have begun to increase across the local area and
are expected to reach 20 knots or more across the local waters
today. Wind readings were indicating low-level winds of 15 to 30

Ireland vs. Northern Ireland game announced for Omagh victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The Irish Republic will host Northern
Ireland in an exhibition soccer game next year, with the proceeds
going to the victims of last August's Omagh bombing.
	   The game will be at Lansdowne Road, Dublin, May 29 and likely
will attract a capacity 50,000 crowd.
	   A car bomb planted by Irish Republican Army dissidents in the
Northern Ireland town of Omagh killed 29 people and injured 370
Aug. 15 in the worst atrocity in the province's 30-year conflict.
	   Details of the game were announced Monday along with several
other matches being organized by Ireland as it prepares for
European Championship qualifying games against Macedonia,
Yugoslavia, Croatia and Malta.
	   Mick McCarthy's team also will host Paraguay Feb. 10 and Sweden
April 28.
	   After the game against Northern Ireland in May, the Irish will
visit Poland Aug. 18 and Denmark in Copenhagen Oct. 9.

Russia calls for speedy lifting of U.N. sanctions on Iraq

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Assuming a familiar stance, Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz and Russian leaders on Monday expressed a
shared desire to see a swift end to the U.N. sanctions against the
Arab nation.
	   ``We believe that soon the sanctions will be lifted,'' Russia's
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told a news conference after meeting
Aziz.
	   Despite Ivanov's optimism, there are no signs that the United
States and Britain, the leading proponents of sanctions, are
prepared to ease their position following repeated showdowns with
Iraq over weapons inspections.
	   Russia called for a ``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's
compliance with United Nations resolutions, saying this should help
wrap up seven years of U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``This review is to lead us to the lifting of the embargo,''
Ivanov said. ``We are approaching the end of a long process.''
	   When pushing its case for sanctions relief, Iraq often turns to
Russia, which has long had good relations with Baghdad and wants to
take part in rebuilding Iraq's shattered economy.
	   Iraq agreed to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors
last month after a confrontation that nearly led to military
strikes by the United States.
	   Aziz said he hoped that ``lawful and objective inspections''
could take place next month. And he again criticized the U.N.
Security Council for failing to end the embargo placed on Iraq
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``For more than seven years Iraq has been following through on
its obligations, but the Security Council hasn't been meeting its
obligations,'' Aziz said. ``This is unacceptable.''
	   However, U.N. inspectors say Baghdad has repeatedly hidden
weapons material and information that it must turn over to win
sanctions relief.
	   Aziz also met Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who has
mediated on several occasions when Iraq and the United Nations were
in the midst of confrontations.
	   While offering Iraq moral support, Russia insists that Baghdad
comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions that call for the
dismantling of all weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq desperately wants to resume exporting oil at full capacity.
It is permitted only limited oil exports at present to buy food and
medicine.
	   Russia, meanwhile, wants to recover billions of dollars in debts
that Iraq ran up in the 1980s when it bought large quantities of
weapons to wage war with Iran.
	   Russian firms have already signed many large business contracts
with Iraq, but they can't be implemented until the sanctions are
lifted.
	   However, oil prices are already sagging due to a worldwide oil
glut, and if Iraq increased its exports, prices could fall even
lower.

Israel refuses to extradite Polish Jew accused of atrocities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Israel has refused to extradite to Poland
a Jewish man accused of atrocities against German prisoners after
World War II, the Justice Ministry said Monday.
	   Solomon Morel, who commanded a camp for German prisoners in
southern Poland, allegedly tortured inmates and was considered
responsible for at least 1,538 deaths, according to the Justice
Ministry.
	   Poland requested Morel's extradition in April on charges of
beating and torturing prisoners and creating inhuman conditions at
the Swietochlowice camp, which he commanded from February to
November 1945.
	   Israel sent a letter last month that said it refused to
extradite Morel to Poland to face the charges. Orit Shemesh, a
spokeswoman for the Israeli Justice Ministry, said the statue of
limitations had run out on the case.
	   A spokeswoman for the Polish Justice Ministry, Barbara
Makosa-Stepkowska, said the charges against Morel failed to meet
the definition of genocide under Israeli law.
	   She said Israel's decision ends the case in Poland, which lacks
the power to appeal. Morel could only be arrested if he left
Israel, Makosa-Stepkowska said.
	   The investigation was the only one in Poland against a Jew
accused of retaliating against the Germans after their defeat.
	   Polish investigators opened the case in 1992. In seeking Morel's
extradition, they said the ``extremely bad conditions'' at the camp
included hunger, overcrowding and epidemic diseases that led to an
unspecified number of deaths.
	   Morel, who lost his parents and two brothers during the war,
moved to Israel in 1994.

Yeltsin fires key aides during a brief break from hospital
</HEADLINE>

one of new aides. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin roused himself from his
sickbed for three hours Monday, fired several of his top aides and
then returned to a Kremlin hospital where he is recuperating from
pneumonia.
	   It was a classic performance from the ailing president, who
rarely seems so energized as when he is firing someone. The
dismissed aides included officials who had commented recently on
the president's poor health.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin told his staff as he
delivered the news, according to presidential spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin.
	   Among those fired was Presidential Chief of Staff Valentin
Yumashev, one of Yeltsin's closest and most loyal aides. A former
journalist who was the ghost-writer of Yeltsin's memoirs, Yumashev
had served as chief of staff for nearly two years _ an eternity in
Yeltsin's Kremlin.
	   ``The president has found a way to revitalize his staff _ by
firing it,'' observed Alexander Shokhin, leader of the
pro-government bloc in parliament and, until recently, a steady
Yeltsin ally.
	   Shown on television, Yeltsin appeared animated and robust as he
scowled and delivered one of his patented tirades.
	   ``Tough discipline, order and reform is what we need,'' Yeltsin
said slowly and sternly as he glared at his staff from the head of
a long table. Aides looked down and busied themselves scribbling
notes.
	   Besides firing Yumashev and three of his deputies, Yeltsin
announced that he was personally taking charge of ``all power
ministries ... including the Justice Ministry and the tax police.''
	   ``Power ministries'' are usually defined as those related to
national defense and security. The Justice Ministry and tax police
are at the forefront of the fight against crime and corruption,
which has taken on new importance following the killing of a top
liberal leader, Galina Starovoitova.
	   Yeltsin's announcement was seen as mostly symbolic, however,
since the president already wields authority over all the
ministries included in his statement, and the ministers who head
them were left in place.
	   His remarks mostly suggested that Yeltsin is tired of being
portrayed as a figurehead who has relinquished all power to his
prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Primakov, appointed in September, has been left to
single-handedly tackle the economic crisis that has mired the
country deeper in poverty. Yeltsin has said little and done less
about the economy in the months since it went into a tailspin in
August.
	   There has been a rising chorus of calls for the president's
resignation, based on his poor health, but Yeltsin has been
defiant, insisting that he will fill out his term until it ends in
2000.
	   Yeltsin has been hospitalized with pneumonia since Nov. 22, and
Yakushkin said he would remain in the hospital as long as necessary
to recuperate. He refused to speculate about how long that would
be.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff, and
Vladimir Makarov, a former KGB officer, was named to one of the
deputy posts. The others remained vacant. Bordyuzha, who will keep
his security job, was formerly chief of the Border Guards.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin had dismissed the aides because of their
failure to stem crime or respond to several incidents of political
extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist parliament
deputy.
	   ``That undermines confidence in the president and in the
government as a whole, and that is inadmissible in the current
difficult economic situation,'' Yakushkin said.
	   Yeltsin has a habit of unexpected and often unexplained
dismissals. The latest round of ousters was also thought to reflect
his unhappiness over aides' unusual candidness about his health in
recent weeks.
	   Yumashev and other Kremlin aides openly said that Yeltsin is too
weak to handle day-to-day affairs or to make foreign trips and
suggested he leave control of the economy and other current affairs
to Primakov.
	   ``The president wanted to show who is the boss,'' said Shokhin.
``He's like a lion who licked his wounds and now roared at those
who thought he was already out of the game.''

Dancesport demonstration rocks the house at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GRANT PECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Dancesport, known socially as ballroom
dancing, rocked the house Monday as it made its debut at a major
international multi-sport event.
	   It is only a demonstration event in the Asian Games, not counted
in the medal standings, but a mostly young local crowd packed the
1,300-seat Bangkok Metropolitan Youth Center gymnasium to watch
couples from China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand rumba, waltz and
cha-cha-cha their hearts out.
	   Top honors in the standard dance _ waltz, tango, Viennese waltz,
slow foxtrot and quickstep _ went to Li Chu-chung and Chang Ko-ping
of Taiwan. China's Shen Yi and Huang Wenjuan carried off the
silver, and the bronze went to their compatriots, Duan Baohua and
Wang Yi.
	   To deafening cheers, Thai dancers Surachai Sriprapat and
Weerawan Sriprapat captured the gold in the faster and more risque
Latin American category, which put contestants through their paces
doing the samba, cha-cha-cha, rumba, paso doble and jive.
	   Taiwan's Tsai Jui-feng and Chiu Shu-chen took the silver, and
the bronze went to Ma Jun and Huang Rui of China.
	   In September 1997, the International Olympic Committee granted
dancesport official recognition as a sport, occasioning snorts of
derision from lovers of more traditional athletic endeavors.
	   Recognition does not automatically qualify a sport for IOC
competitions. But the German-based International Dancesport
Federation hopes to get the event into the 2008 Olympics, if not
the 2004 games in Athens.
	   No one watching Monday's show could deny that it was a
spectacle, but is it sport?
	   ``If (IOC president Juan Antonio) Samaranch says it's a sports,
it's a sport,'' joked International Dancesport Federation president
Rudolf Baumann, who flew to Bangkok for Monday's event.
	   Like other supporters of the event, he contended that dancesport
requires as much strength, training and endurance as many other
established sports.
	   Sport or not, the crowd loved the show. Take every Hollywood
dance movie from the past 60 years, drop the plot line, tack
together a highlights tape, and you've got the idea.
	   ``Standard'' is for the older more up-market crowd. The men
dance in white tie and tails, and their partners in flamboyantly
colored ball gowns.
	   ``Latin'' is where the younger crowd lets rip. The men wear what
could best be described as black matador gear, and the women _ very
little. Sequins figure prominently, however.
	   ``It's terrific, it's fantastic, it combines art and sport, the
physical and technique,'' said dermatologist Wibool Sareevutr, 31,
a spectator.
	   One of the Singaporean competitors, Wee Giam Goh, said he
practices almost every day for 3-4 hours.
	   ``It's graceful, exciting, good sport,'' said Goh, 45. ``If
taken as a sport it lasts through old age, helping to keep good
posture and flexibility.''
	   His dancing shoes, he said, cost 130 Singapore dollars (US dlrs
80) a pair, and each pair lasts only a few months.
	   That's nothing compared to the gowns his wife must wear for the
standard competitions.
	   The prices range from 4,000-6,000 Singapore dollars (U.S. dlrs
2,450-3,680) said Siew Bee Tan. They come from Italy and Britain.
	   ``This is my third gown,'' she said. ``After a few dances you
have to change it.''
	   The couple doesn't dance full-time. He's in business, she works
in a bank.
	   ``We save to dance,'' said Goh.

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Representatives of the International
Monetary Fund resumed talks with the Belarusian government Monday
on a dlrs 100 million emergency compensation loan.
	   The IMF had previously agreed to offer the loan if Belarus

UN rights commissioner: 50th anniversary party is badly needed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES in 13th graf with Chirac quote on purpose of
celebration &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo Planned
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The 50th birthday of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights comes none too soon _ because the world needs to be
reminded that the much-ignored document exists, the U.N. human
rights commissioner says.
	   ``We really need a celebration,'' Mary Robinson said in an
interview Monday, before joining President Jacques Chirac to kick
off a weeklong commemoration in the French capital. ``We need to
renew the vision.''
	   Robinson, the former president of Ireland who has been U.N. High
Commissioner of Human Rights for a year, said she was struck by
surveys saying only seven percent of the world knows about the
Declaration, created in the aftermath of Nazi genocide.
	   ``If people know their rights, and know that they belong to them
_ not to states _ it helps them to assert and to claim those
rights,'' she said.
	   But in fact, Robinson said, more people in the world are aware
of the hazards to the environment than the hazards to human rights.
	   ``In terms of awareness, we're about 15 years behind the
environmental lobby,'' she said.
	   Fifty years after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was
inaugurated on Dec. 10, 1948, atrocities persist, in places like
Rwanda and Bosnia, to name just a few. The first priority is to
address those gross violations, Robinson said.
	   The world needs to learn how to address human rights violations
by non-state actors _ paramilitary groups and extremists _ as well
those by states, she said.
	   Just as important is to focus on new areas, such as the
influential role of international corporations, she said.
	   ``Those corporations have immense power,'' she said. ``We need
to show them that human rights is in the business interest of
business.''
	   And then there is poverty _ ``such a terrible violation of so
many human rights,'' Robinson said. ``One of the strengths of the
declaration is that it recognizes economic rights, too.''
	   The weeklong celebration in Paris will draw U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the
Dalai Lama, Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng, and a host of other
dissidents, celebrities, even rock stars.
	   Chirac said Monday in a speech Monday that the celebrations were
intended ``to wake up consciences, map out new paths'' in the
struggle for human rights.
	   There will be receptions, demonstrations and a concert starring
Alanis Morissette, Peter Gabriel and Tracy Chapman, among others.
	   There already has been one controversy: newspapers reported last
week that Chirac had not included the Dalai Lama on the guest list
for a luncheon Tuesday honoring Nobel laureates, suggesting China
had pressured Chirac.
	   The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader confirmed Monday that he had
been invited and will attend.

Canada 3000 and its pilots reach tentative deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, Canada (AP) _ Canada 3000 Airlines Ltd., a charter
airline serving many Caribbean destinations, and the union
representing its 235 pilots have reached a tentative deal for a
first contract.
	   A spokesman for the Pilots Association of Canada, which had been
negotiating with the company for the contract for two-and-a-half
years, said he was reasonably pleased with the outcome.
	   ``It's not everything we had hoped for but there are elements
there to make us pleased and there's always another contract,''
said First Officer Pat Ellison.
	   Canada 3000 flies to Antigua, Barbados, St. Lucia, Grenada and
Jamaica, in addition to other vacation destinations.
	   The agreement was reached late Saturday with the help of a
federal conciliator, Arnold Palmer, who stepped into the
negotiations in September.
	   Angus Kinnear, president of the charter airline, which operates
out of Vancouver and Toronto, also expressed satisfaction with the
agreement.
	   Under it, the airline ``will continue to offer the same high
quality, reliable, on-time service, that puts us at the forefront
of our industry,'' he said in a news release.
	   Ellison said the union will hold meetings with pilots this week
and set up a ratification vote ``reasonably quickly.'' He said he
expects pilots will approve the deal.
	   Details won't be released until after the vote.
	   If approved, the three-year contract would be retroactive to
Nov. 1.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian writer Mohammed Mokhtari left his
home Thursday and has not been heard of since, adding to a recent
spate of mysterious disappearances, the Zan newspaper reported
Monday.
	   Mokhtari, a poet and member of the Association of Iranian
Writers, left to go shopping in the residential suburb in northern
Tehran, Zan said. It said Mokhtari's family searched hospitals,
morgues and police stations but could not find him.
	   The writer's association to which he belongs has written a
letter to authorities asking them to look into his disappearance.
	   Increasingly, hard-line rivals of President Mohammad Khatami are
resorting to violence to deal with opponents. Over the past year,
vigilantes have attacked dissidents, liberal newspapers and even a
reformist Cabinet minister.
	   None of the thugs has been arrested, leading to suspicions they
are backed by powerful hard-line clerics like spiritual leader Ali
Khamenei and Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, the head of the judiciary.
	   In a speech to university students on Monday, Khatami lashed out
at Iranians who resort to violence, the official Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
	   He pointed out that during his campaign last year, he argued for
political development, social justice and the rule of law _ ideas
considered by some as too liberal or anti-Islamic.
	   ``It was not our intention to do away with any opposition
view,'' Khatami told the students at Sharif Technical University,
IRNA said.
	   But he noted that this was not understood by some, criticizing
``some groups who dislike the government and are not ready to abide
by the principles of democracy.''
	   He did not single out any individual or group, and IRNA said he
urged all to ``follow the policy of reconciliation and dialogue.''
	   He warned that ``violence will be followed by violence'' and
that ``in a society where law is not respected, violence will
replace the law,'' the news agency said.
	   Last month the head of an Iranian opposition group, Dariush
Foruhar, and his wife Parvaneh were stabbed to death in their home.
	   Police have said they've made several arrests in the murders of
the Foruhars, after Khatami condemned the killings and ordered an
investigation. So far, the findings have not been made public.

Iraq says cooperation with inspectors won't go on ``too long''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will not cooperate with U.N.
inspectors for ``too long'' and will refuse further delays in
completing their disarmament activities in the country, Iraq's vice
president said Monday.
	   Addressing about 80 Jordanian officials and politicians at a
pro-Iraq conference, Taha Yassin Ramadan also made clear that Iraq
will not remain idle if a promised review of its progress in
disarmament does not eventually lead to a lifting of sanctions.
	   The team returned to Iraq on Nov. 14, nearly three weeks after
Iraq cut cooperation with the inspectors. The inspectors must
certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons on mass destruction
before the United Nations will lift sanctions imposed after Iraq
invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Iraq allowed the inspectors back after the United States and
Britain threatened airstrikes to force compliance.
	   Ramadan said Iraq's decision to have the inspectors back ``did
not solve the crisis but merely deferred it.''
	   He said although the specter of U.S. and British military
strikes remained, Iraq would not change its demand to have the
sanctions removed.
	   ``UNSCOM has limited opportunity. We have our own principles
which we have made public. Any violation of its mandate will be
rejected by Iraq,'' Ramadan said.
	   He said he was not setting ``a time ceiling'' for UNSCOM to
finish its work but warned Iraq's patience this time will continue
``within a time that is not too long.''
	   The devastating sanctions, which limit Iraq's oil exports, will
not be lifted until the inspectors certify that Baghdad has
scrapped its nuclear, biological and chemical weapons along with
the long-range missiles to deliver them.
	   Ramadan said Iraq was waiting for chief inspector Richard Butler
to announce that Baghdad was cooperating with his commission so
that a comprehensive review on its disarmament efforts will start
in the Security Council.
	   ``Just a review is not what we want. It should have an aim and
lead to a result,'' Ramadan said.
	   Ramdan said Iraq was certain that the United States would not
allow any lifting of sanctions even if UNSCOM gave it a clean bill
of health because the American aim is to topple President Saddam
Hussein.
	   He said that therefore the winner ``in all battles with
America'' is Saddam because he remains in power.
	   Ramadan said Iraq is not as angry with Washington as it is with
``some Arab rulers who are more keen to eliminate the regime than
both America and Britain.''
	   Ramadan's tough remarks on Arab rulers contrasted with those in
a front-page editorial in the ruling Baath Party newspaper
al-Thawra, which urged members of the Gulf Cooperation Council
meeting in Abu Dhabi to turn a new page with Iraq.

`Bye Bye America' packs them in, giving Iraqis chance to laugh
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ After the tattered curtains part at the
Sheherezad Theater, it takes all of about 15 seconds to grasp that
Baghdad's most popular play is, well, playing to its audience.
	   To the frenzied strains of an Arab pop song, there's a
cross-dressing bellydancer, seductively clad women, a government
official wiggling and jiggling _ and the suggestion of drink and
drugs in the office of the Kuwaiti Ministry of Animal Resources.
	   Onstage come a secretary who works as a pimp, an effeminate
deputy minister who loves his wine as well as his women, and his
boss, who goes nowhere without an escort of prostitutes.
	   The plot?
	   Tucked in with dancing, stand-up routines and a few ballads is
the story _ sort of _ of the ministry's plan to buy an American
bull for the outrageous price of dlrs 115 million to improve the
gene pool of Kuwait's livestock.
	   ``Bye Bye America'' has packed in theatergoers in its wild
two-week run. Its target, obviously enough, is the Kuwaiti
government, with some barbed attacks on America's sway over the
Arab Gulf regimes. And the audience, howling throughout, loves it.
	   The play is the latest in a string of productions that have
transformed Iraq's once-dormant theater scene into a thriving arena
for artistic expression that is often daring and always ribald.
	   From just two playhouses a decade ago to 20 today, theater
stands as one of the few bright spots on Baghdad's bleak cultural
landscape, where U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait
in 1990 have impoverished most Iraqis.
	   At times, the stifling hand of President Saddam Hussein has
meant that his ubiquitous portraits are one of the few visible
signs of artistic creativity.
	   Often the lines of popular plays are quoted in cafes, and
tickets for some shows on the weekends can be scalped for five
times the price of 1,000 diners, or 55 cents.
	   The laughs don't just come at the expense of Kuwait, either.
	   The bribes and bureaucracy that torment Iraqis are often the
butt of jokes. One play, ``A Party for a Respectful Person,''
skewered an Iraqi official for obstructing the permits that Iraqis
need to travel and to sell and buy a house.
	   Some criticism is even bolder, the kind of stuff that would
never appear in Iraq's staid newspapers.
	   In one, ``Playground of the Hypocrites,'' an Iraqi is detained
and politely asked to sit down by his interrogator. He is then told
to confess. But, he asks, where is the boiling oil, the whips and
the ceiling fan he should be hanging from?
	   When told there's nothing of the sort, he warns his
interrogator, ``They're going to fire you!''
	   All the plays are comedies, and in that is their saving grace,
providing an officially sanctioned outlet for mounting frustration.
	   ``Life used to be much easier, and now all that is cut off,''
said Sarah Aetna, the writer of ``Bye Bye America.'' ``Iraqis feel
they are suffocating with the sanctions, and the theater gives them
the lungs they can breathe with.''
	   The comedy in his play is fast and fierce, playing on every
Iraqi stereotype of Kuwait and making up a few along the way.
	   Not only does oil-rich Kuwait spend dlrs 115 million for the
American bull. It allots dlrs 20 million for its housing, food and
entertainment and another huge sum for an airplane _ equipped with
a swimming pool _ for the bull.
	   A delegation meets him at the airport. And functionaries
interview an Indian cook and a Chinese barber to care for him.
	   ``We will bring cows from the Philippines, Thailand and Holland.
We'll bring them from all over to entertain the bull,'' said Mr.
Fouad, the minister's secretary and pimp.
	   Inside the office, the deputy ministry drinks liquor behind the
cloth of his gown. He complains incessantly that Mr. Fouad will not
deliver to him the women provided to the minister. And he signs his
papers with a thumbprint because he cannot read or write.
	   In any crisis, the minister shouts, ``Call America! Call Texas!
Call Washington!''
	   Actors and audience alike insist that the play is not insulting
Kuwaitis. It's all in fun, they say.
	   ``We like to enjoy ourselves, even if it is for a short time,''
said Satar Karim, 37, who came with his family.
	   On this night, one of Baghdad's frequent electricity outages cut
short the performance. No matter, Karim said.
	   ``It's always good to laugh.''

Kosovo Albanian negotiator: U.S. plan totally unacceptable
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. peace efforts in Kosovo
suffered a setback Monday when the chief ethnic Albanian negotiator
rejected a proposal for the future of the secessionist province of
Serbia.
	   The plan was presented by U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who has
been trying to hammer out a peace formula acceptable to both the
majority ethnic Albanians and the government of Serbia.
	   Fehmi Agani, head of the Kosovo Albanian negotiating team, said
the latest version of the U.S. peace plan was ``almost identical to
the Serbian proposal for Kosovo'' and ``cannot be considered a
basis for ... future negotiations.''
	   Agani said the previous U.S. draft for Kosovo ``envisaged the
formation of independent institutions'' in the province, although
it did not provide for independence as the majority ethnic
Albanians have demanded. The Serbs rejected that version.
	   Agani, however, said the latest U.S. proposal incorporated a
major Serb demand, which is to have Kosovo remain part of Serbia _
and within its legal system.
	   Although a de-facto cease fire generated by an agreement to end
a government crackdown in Kosovo has reduced bloodshed, there are
fears that Kosovo will again explode in fierce fighting unless a
political solution is found by spring.
	   Clashes this year pitting an alliance of Yugoslav army and Serb
police forces against rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army claimed
hundreds of lives and made more than a quarter of a million people
homeless. Serbia is the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   But Hill's efforts so far have been fruitless with the two sides
unable to agree on a formula.
	   Ivan Sedlak, a member of the Serbian government delegation for
Kosovo talks, said the government side still hasn't studied the
latest version of Hill's plan.
	   Sedlak said a previous version was unacceptable because it
defined Kosovo virtually as a separate state. But Sedlak did not
comment on the reworked draft.
	   A previous version of the U.S. draft was rejected by Serbia
because it gave the republic almost no control over Kosovo. But
that formula was cautiously greeted by ethnic Albanian negotiators
and the guerrillas gave a mixed response, with one faction not
ruling it out as an interim solution, and the other rejecting it.
	   ``We had some objections to the previous version too, but this
one is totally unacceptable,'' Agani told Glas. ``It is obvious
that Hill offers one solution after talking to us and another after
talking to (Serbian president Milan) Milutinovic.''
	   It was not clear what changes were made to the previous draft,
but Agani's criticism suggested the reworked version gave Serbia
more authority in Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who make up more than 90 percent of Kosovo's
population, overwhelmingly seek independence from Serbia.

EU backs German-Italian call for international court to try Ocalan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union endorsed a call by
Italy and Germany Monday for an neutral, international tribunal to
try Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan who was arrested Nov. 15
in Rome, where he remains under police guard.
	   The EU foreign ministers issued a statement denouncing
international terrorism and Ocalan's outlawed Kurdish Workers
Party, or PKK. They also backed Italy for not extraditing Ocalan to
Turkey where he faces the death penalty there.
	   Germany, which has issued a warrant for Ocalan's arrest, has
ruled out seeking his extradition for fear of stirring unrest among
the nation's Turkish population of 2 million, one-fifth of which
are Kurds.
	   In stead, Italy and Germany want an international tribunal to
try him, a view endorsed by the other 13 EU nations, said an
Austrian official whose country currently holds the EU's rotating
presidency.
	   A full text of the EU statement was not immediately available.
	   The PKK has fought a 14-year war for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey,
in which about 37,000 people have been killed. Ocalan faces murder
and terror charges in his native Turkey and in Germany, but his
fate remains uncertain. Germany banned the PKK in 1993 after a
string of arson attacks.

Truffle price rises before the holidays
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The price of truffles, the ``black diamonds'' of
French cuisine, has shot up this holiday season after a
particularly dry summer led to a smaller than usual harvest.
	   At the Sainte-Alvere truffle market in western France, the price
of first-quality truffles on Monday was 3500 francs (dlrs 625) per
kilogram.
	   In recent years, good truffles have sold for 2800 to 3000 francs
(dlrs 500 to dlrs 535) per kilo, said Guy Moner, a salesman at
Paris' Maison des Truffes.
	   ``With the summer's dry weather, you don't get as many truffles
because the conditions aren't right,'' Moner explained.
	   Truffle hunters use pigs and dogs to sniff the ground for the
rare fungi, which clings to underground tree roots. Found mainly in
France, Spain and Italy, the potato-shaped delicacy has a pungent,
woodsy flavor.

 &UR; Slovakia looking for sign of encouragement from Vienna summit

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Slovakia's new government is hoping
that the upcoming European summit in Vienna will provide some
encouragement for its hopes of membership in the European Union,
officials said Monday.
	   Slovakia was excluded from group of first candidates under the
authoritarian rule of former Prime Minister Vladmir Meciar. But new
government of Mikulas Dzurinda, which took office Oct. 30, is
hoping the EU states will accept that Slovakia is back on the road
to genuine democracy and respect for human rights.
	   Slovak officials believe that process would be helped if the EU
sends signals that the community is ready to take another look at
Slovakia, which broke off from the former Czechoslovakia in 1993.
	   ``Policy wait-and-see is not appropriate because some concrete
measures have already been taken in Slovakia. The Vienna summit
should implement these in the end at least in a positive mention of
developments in Slovakia,'' Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan told
reporters.
	   EU expansion is expected to figure prominently during the
two-day summit which begins Friday in Vienna. In a meeting Monday
in Brussels, Belgium, EU foreign ministers struggled to keep the
expansion drive alive, trying to sound welcoming to newcomers yet
without committing themselves to specific entry dates.
	   EU members disagree on how to fund a near-doubling of the ranks
and how fast to expand the union. Negotiations opened this fall
with Cyprus, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia and
Slovenia.
	   Preliminary talks with slower-track candidates Slovakia,
Lithuania, Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria.
	   Slovak officials are looking primarily to Austria, which
currently holds the EU presidency, and Germany, which assumes the
post in January, to help promote renewed interest in Slovak
membership.
	   ``We rely mostly on Austria and Germany but we also have good
relations with France and other members of the EU,'' said Vice
Premier Pavol Hamzic.
	   The prime minister said that more than 70 percent of Slovakia's
people support membership of the EU and more than half want to join
NATO.
	   Slovak officials have declared that membership in the EU and
NATO is the country's priority.
	   Dzurinda assumed the prime ministership after assembling a
majority coalition from opposition groups that finished just behind
Meciar's ruling party in September parliamentary elections.
	   Despite facing an economic crunch, Dzurinda said the new
government wants to balance the budget and maintain economic
growth. He also hopes to reduce unemployment to 10 percent from 14
percent by the end of the government's term in 2002.

Rwanda says it will stay in Congo without security guarantees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Rwanda will maintain troops in neighboring
Congo in the absence of adequate security guarantees along its
border, Vice President Paul Kagame said.
	   Kagame, who is also minister of defense, said Sunday that Rwanda
would support any U.N.-brokered peace agreement which addresses
both the concerns of Congolese rebels fighting to overthrow
President Laurent Kabila and his country's own security concerns.
	   ``If we were given cast-iron guarantees by the international
community that our security concerns would be addressed, and Kabila
demonstrated a genuine commitment to address our security concerns,
then we would have no further need to keep our troops in Congo,''
Kagame told the British Broadcasting Corp.
	   Rwandan Hutu rebels use bases in eastern Congo to launch
cross-border attacks aimed at destabilizing the Rwandan government.
	   So far, peace initiatives to end Congo's four-month war have
failed over Kabila's refusal to negotiate directly with the
Congolese rebel coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disaffected Congolese
soldiers and opposition politicians.
	   He instead has demanded that Rwanda and Uganda, who are openly
supporting the Congolese rebels, withdraw their backing.
	   The conflict, which began Aug. 2, has drawn in Zimbabwe, Angola,
Namibia and Chad fighting in support of Kabila.
	   In a summit last month in Paris, Rwanda agreed with Uganda,
Zimbabwe and Congo to sign a cease-fire in Lusaka, Zambia on Dec.
14-15, but later added that any agreement will have to include the
rebels.
	   Kagame said his troops had intervened in Congo because Kabila
had recruited thousands of former Hutu soldiers and militiamen who
had fled Rwanda in fear of reprisals for a 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
	   ``The international community must understand that this is an
issue that affects our very exsistance as a nation and as a
people,'' he said.
	   More than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus
were slaughtered in the Hutu government-sponsored genocide before
Tutsi-led rebels won power in July 1994, sending the defeated Hutu
soldiers into what was then Zaire.
	   Many of them regrouped in bases in eastern Congo.
	   In 1996, Rwanda supported Kabila's rebels who ousted longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko but failed to rid the common border from
Hutu fighters.
	   ``Kabila and his allies will never be able to overrun eastern
Congo, that is impossible,'' Kagame said. ``They also cannot wish
away the problems they have created. They need to sit down and talk
to those fighting them.''

Liverpool, Juventus, Barcelona in Euro, domestic humiliation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three of the most dominant clubs in European
soccer _ Liverpool, Juventus and Barcelona _ are in crisis.
	   Sliding in their domestic leagues, all three could be ousted
from their European club competitions Wednesday night even before
the quarterfinal stage.
	   Liverpool's demise has prompted speculation that the club might
not be able to hang on to teen-age sensation Michael Owen. The
18-year-old striker, who has just signed a 5-year contract, says he
might not stay around if Liverpool isn't in contention to win
titles.
	   ``My ambition is to win honors because I haven't won anything
yet,'' said Owen, the youngest player to score for England and
famed for his memorable solo strike against Argentina in the World
Cup.
	   ``I still have five years left with Liverpool and I am happy to
be here. But, after five years, who knows what might happen?''
	   Owen's comments will alert clubs who might want to buy him
sooner and they won't go down well with the Liverpool fans who have
been starved of success for almost a decade after dominating the
70s and 80s.
	   Although Liverpool, with 26 years of European action behind it,
holds the record for 18 league titles and won the Champions Cup
four times, it last won the domestic league in 1990, and its last
European success was in 1984.
	   Juventus, playing European club soccer for the 38th season, has
only an outside chance of staying in the Champions Cup after making
the final three years in a row. Juve needs to beat group leader
Rosenborg of Norway and hope that Turkish club Galatasaray loses to
last place Athletic Bilbao.
	   Juve, which lost for the third time in four Serie A games
Sunday, hasn't won for a month and has been shut out four times in
a row. The club slipped into sixth place, seven points behind
surprise leader Fiorentina, and highly-respected coach Marcello
Lippi, being touted as Inter Milan's new leader next season, has
much to do to mount a challenge in the second half of the season.
	   He will have to do it without star striker Alessandro Del Piero,
who is out for the rest of the season with damaged knee ligaments.
	   ``It's a rough stretch,'' Lippi said. ``We're well aware of the
negative figures that are adding up. But there is absolutely no
desire to abdicate. We will not give up.
	   ``It's not too late, but we do have to start playing better and
seeing some results,'' Lippi said.
	   ``This is a bad time, but Juventus always seems to come through
when the going gets difficult,'' reserve forward Nicola Amoruso
said. ``Unfortunately, Del Piero hurt himself and what's also
missing right now is confidence.''
	   Barcelona, already out of the Champions Cup in its centenary
year, tumbled 2-1 on Saturday at Deportivo de La Coruna, a third
loss in a row. The losses have heaped even more pressure on Dutch
coach Louis van Gaal, with critics saying he's wrecked the team by
fielding five Dutch players in his squad. Yet last season, Van
Gaal's team completed a Spanish league and cup double.
	   Wednesday's Champions Cup game against Denmark's Brondby in
Copenhagen has no meaning because both teams have been eliminated.
That means even a victory won't help Van Gaal's plight and another
defeat will mean more agony for the fans.
	   ``Things could not be worse,'' Van Gaal admitted Monday. ``We
need ambition. The team needs this match to mend its damaged
image.''

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A bit of America was at the Asian Games
baseball Monday. Including chewing tobacco.
	   Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Park Chan-ho mesmerized spectators
as he led his native land, South Korea, to a 16-5 victory over
Taiwan in the opening day's second game. Park pitched five innings,
allowed only four hits and struck out five batters. Earlier, host
Thailand defeated the Philippines 6-5 in the day's other game.
	   As Park showed glimpses of U.S. Major League baseball with
pitches of up to 145 kph (90 mph), scouts for the New York Yankees,
Cleveland Indians, Atlanta Braves and Pittsburgh Pirates watched
the games in hopes of finding more like him.
	   Some of them carried the hallmark of U.S. baseball _ chewing
tobacco _ and spit the juice into empty cans of cola.
	   Knowing that a gold for South Korea may help him avoid a
mandatory three-year stint of military duty that could jeopardize
his professional and millionaire career, Park, 25, said tersely
after the game: ``I feel good.''
	   ``I will do my best to help our team earn the gold,'' Park had
said in earlier interviews.
	   There has been talk that for his contributions to Korean
prestige, Park might win an exemption from military service,
something not normally granted to professional athletes.
	   The American scouts did their work armed with speed measuring
machines, stop watches and notebooks.
	   ``We are looking for good prospects,'' said John Cox of the
Yankees, as he scribbled notes about individual pitchers.
	   In the United States, baseball immigrants are continuing a trend
that began in the 1960s when the Major Leagues tapped Latin America
for players such as Orlando Cepeda, Juan Marichal and Roberto
Clemente.
	   The Los Angeles Dodgers have Park, the New York Mets have
Japan's Hideo Nomo, the 1995 National League rookie of the year,
and Hideki Irabu pitches for the World Series champion New York
Yankees.
	   The scouts are now looking at Asia more and more.
	   ``I often go to Latin America, but here I am in Asia,'' said Les
Pajari of the Indians, who spent three hours in a taxi to get to
the baseball stadium.
	   ``I had problems in making my driver understand, maybe because
of the way I speak English,'' he said.
	   Before each game started, the scouts approached Thai officials
to get individual details of players.
	   ``It is very important to know how old they are and what are
their heights and how much they weigh,'' said Neil Burke of the
Pirates.
	   Besides South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the Philippines, China
and Japan also are vying for the gold.
	   Baseball was added to the Asian Games in 1990 at Beijing. Taiwan
then won the gold, South Korea finished second and Japan third. In
the Hiroshima games in 1994, Japan defeated South Korea in the
final, with Taiwan taking the bronze.

Syria seen adopting a new approach toward Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Syria's pivotal role in resolving the
frequent political crises among its allies in the Lebanese
government seems to be subtly changing with the new administration
of Lebanese President Emile Lahoud.
	   In the past, the Beirut-Damascus highway was virtually a
pilgrimage route for Lebanese politicians seeking favors from Syria
and returning to make pronouncements _ which were taken as Syria's
view.
	   But since Lahoud was elected with backing from Syrian President
Hafez Assad in October, there is silence from the Syrian capital,
suggesting a new hands-off approach in the day-to-day governing of
its smaller, weaker Arab neighbor.
	   The door to Damascus has since been reported by the Lebanese
press to be virtually shut, and kowtowing Lebanese politicians have
been told by Syria to return home.
	   This does not change Syria's domination of this country, which
rests on the presence of 30,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon. To some,
Syria is the guarantor of the agreement that ended Lebanon's
1975-90 civil war.
	   The Lebanese press has made only vague references to what
prompted the about-face in Syria's approach, but the Saudi-owned
Asharq al-Awsat on Monday quoted political circles in Damascus as
offering a more direct reason.
	   The London-based newspaper reported that Bashar Assad, the
Syrian leader's son, has taken over handling Lebanon. That job had
been handled by Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam, long Syria's
expert on Lebanese politics.
	   Bashar, who has the military rank of lieutenant colonel and is
commander-in-chief of Syria's Republican Guards, has taken on
political prominence following the death of his elder brother Basil
in a 1994 car crash.
	   Rumors had been swirling in Beirut that the stunning political
changes of the last week that saw the sudden replacement of Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri by Salim Hoss had the tacit blessing of
Damascus.
	   Hariri _ who had been regarded as Syria's ally _ quit
unexpectedly in an apparent power struggle with Lahoud.
	   Lahoud appointed Hoss, who shares the president's views that
revitalizing the economy and battling government corruption must be
Lebanon's main goals. Asharq Al-Awsat suggested that similar
reforms could follow in Syria.
	   The developments in Lebanon also could be a prelude to preparing
Bashar for more power in his own country by tightening his grip
over Lebanon. After Lahoud's election, Bashar traveled to Beirut to
personally lend his backing to the new president.
	   One holdover on Hoss' Cabinet is ex-militia leader Suleiman
Franjieh, who is reported in the Arab media to be a friend of
Bashar.
	   During the power struggle, there was no trip by Hariri to
Damascus, a departure from the familiar pattern of past Lebanese
political crises.
	   Beirut news reports _ denied by Hariri aides _ said that the
then-prime minister planned a trip but was told by Syrian officials
that it was not necessary.
	   Walid Jumblatt, leader of the Druse minority and an outspoken
former Cabinet minister, on Sunday became the first to proclaim
publicly that Hariri was ousted in a ``bloodless coup.''
	   Political columnist Sarkis Naoum hinted in Monday's leading
An-Nahar newspaper that Hariri was driven from power as a result of
a decision from ``influential powers'' _ meaning Syria _ in
coordination with senior Lebanese politicians.
	   He said the former prime minister should have understood the
message. ``Hariri should have known ... that it was time that he
decided to rest,'' Naoum added.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A top Bosnian Serb general pleaded
innocent Monday to charges that he played a pivotal role in a 1995
orgy of killing described as Europe's worst civilian massacre since
World War II.
	   Prosecutors allege that Gen. Radislav Krstic commanded Bosnian
Serb troops who massacred thousands of Muslims as they sought
shelter in the U.N.-protected ``safe haven'' of Srebrenica in
eastern Bosnia.
	   Krstic, the most senior Bosnian Serb suspect in U.N. custody,
listened carefully Monday as his 13-page genocide indictment was
read at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal.
	   Then, as each of six charges was put to him, he calmly and
confidently responded: ``I plead not guilty.''
	   He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted of
any one of the charges, which cover allegations of genocide,
extermination, murder and persecution. A trial date has not been
set.
	   Krstic, wearing a green suit, white shirt and tie, was allowed
to remain seated as he entered his pleas. His lawyer, Belgrade
attorney Nenad Petrusic, told presiding Judge Claude Jorda of
France that Krstic was suffering from serious injuries which made
it difficult for him to stand up. Krstic lost part of his right
leg, reportedly after stepping on a mine in 1994.
	   Petrusic described Krstic's health as ``truly, seriously
imperiled,'' and said there was a chance of gangrene where the limb
was amputated.
	   Asked by Jorda how he felt, Krstic said: ``As well as can be
expected on the whole, but I am tired after the arrest.
Exhausted.'' Krstic also complained that there was no heating in
his U.N. cell and that he was receiving no therapy for his injured
leg.
	   But he added that he had been treated well since his arrest last
Wednesday in northern Bosnia by U.S. troops serving in the NATO-led
Stabilization Force.
	   Krstic, reportedly a close associate of former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military leader Gen. Ratko
Mladic, is accused of helping to plan and carry out the July 1995
massacre of thousands of Muslims in Srebrenica.
	   Both Karadzic and Mladic also face genocide charges alleging
that they masterminded the slaughter, but neither is in custody.
	   According to the indictment, forces under Krstic and Mladic
``either expelled or killed'' almost every Bosnian Muslim in the
enclave using automatic weapons, hand grenades and other weaponry.
	   In Karadzic and Mladic's indictments, prosecutors estimate that
some 6,000 Muslims, mostly civilians, were killed at Srebrenica _
making it Europe's worst civilian massacre since the Holocaust.
	   Krstic's indictment, issued in October and publicized only after
his arrest, describes the killings as ``wide-scale and organized.''
The indictment had been kept secret to prevent Krstic from going
into hiding.
	   Muslims were assembled at locations including a warehouse and
schools before being summarily executed, prosecutors claim.
	   Krstic's troops also allegedly plowed victims into mass graves
in a hasty attempt to conceal the slaughter. They later dug up the
bodies and reburied them elsewhere when the international community
learned of the killings, prosecutors allege.
	   The tribunal was established in 1993 by the U.N. Security
Council to prosecute genocide and war crimes stemming from the
armed clashes that marked the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.

Kosovo Albanian negotiator: U.S. plan totally unacceptable
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs, UPDATES with Kosovo Albanian negotiator's comments,
CHANGES byline, no pickup. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Efforts to forge a political
solution for Kosovo appeared stalemated Monday after the chief
ethnic Albanian negotiator rejected the latest American plan for
the troubled province.
	   Fehmi Agani said the new U.S. draft for a political settlement
in the majority Albanian province was too close to the views of
Serbia. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   Most ethnic Albanians, however, want independence or substantial
self-rule.
	   Speaking to reporters in the provincial capital Pristina, Agani
blasted the American draft as ``unacceptable'' and said it could
not be ``considered a basis for ... future negotiations.''
	   The United States is leading diplomatic efforts to hammer out a
solution which would be acceptable both to independence-seeking
ethnic Albanians and to the Serbian regime which wants to keep
control over Kosovo.
	   Hundreds have been killed and almost 300,000 ethnic Albanians
displaced in a seven-month crackdown by Serbian forces against
Kosovo's separatists, before an October peace agreement brought
about a tentative truce.
	   American envoy Christopher Hill, shuttling between Belgrade and
Kosovo, has so far presented four versions of a U.S. formula for
the future of the province.
	   ``The new (American) draft is ... almost identical to the
Serbian'' plan, Agani told reporters.
	   Serbia last month released its own proposal for Kosovo under
which the province would be given a degree of autonomy but would
remain firmly under Serbian control.
	   According to Agani, the latest American version accepted the
major Serb demand to have Kosovo remain within Yugoslavia as part
of Serbia and substantially within Serbia's legal system.
	   The previous U.S. draft left out a detailed formula for the
province's final status but ``envisaged... independent institutions
in Kosovo,'' Agani said. He said the earlier draft ``although far
from (ethnic Albanian) demands,'' had ``opened up perspective.''
	   He added the latest changes in the American draft were
``incomprehensible'' and said the ethnic Albanian team would soon
come up with its own proposal for Kosovo.
	   The changes to which the ethnic Albanian side objected most
revolved around Kosovo's future parliament which, according to the
latest American draft, would not be able to pass laws.
	   Also, the draft did not foresee Kosovo as having a separate
government.
	   This latest version of Hill's plan has not been studied by the
Serbian government, Ivan Sedlak, an official in the Serbian team
for Kosovo talks, said.
	   Sedlak said the previous U.S. version was unacceptable because
it defined Kosovo virtually as a separate state but did not comment
on the reworked draft.
	   Although a de-facto cease fire generated by the October
agreement to end a government crackdown in Kosovo has reduced
bloodshed, there are fears that Kosovo will again explode in fierce
fighting unless a political solution is found by spring.

Taiwanese gymnasts show signs of improvement at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Boosting Taiwan's chances of its first
Asian Games medal in gymnastics in eight years, Chen Kuang-hui
scored an impressive 9.70 points on the rings Monday in the team
competition, qualifying for the apparatus finals.
	   Chen, 25, said a wobble on landing stopped him from scoring even
higher. But it still was the second-highest ring score of the day,
tying him with China's Huang Xu and Yang Wei. It also was the
highest score of the day among any of the Taiwanese gymnasts.
	   ``If I do even better I've got a chance of a medal,'' said Chen.
	   Another Taiwanese, Chian Chieng-tun, also qualified for a place
in Thursday's apparatus competition, with a 9.650 on the pommel
horse.
	   Chian and two other Taiwanese, Wu Chin-chan and Liu Yu-tsung,
also qualified for Wednesday's competition to find the best
all-round gymnast.
	   Overall, Taiwan placed seventh in Monday's team competition,
ahead of Iran in last place.
	   ``I'm not satisfied but it was OK,'' said coach Wang
Min-yan.``We have progressed.''
	   He said he was ``still hopeful'' of medals in the individual
event contests.
	   Taiwan won two bronze medals at the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing,
China, but was without a medal at Hiroshima, Japan, four years
later.
	   Taiwan's team has been trained over the past year by a coach
from China, the region's gymnastic powerhouse.

Program shows education can be fun, effective
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALMORA, India (AP) _ Children in this corner of northern India
face many obstacles on the way to an education, starting with what
for many are long treks across treacherous mountain trails to reach
village schools.
	   Now a program drawing on songs, stories and games is drawing
them to school like never before, and could help teachers around
the world reach more children, UNICEF officials say. They described
their ``joyful learning'' program to reporters over the weekend as
the U.N. agency prepared to release an international report on
children and education on Tuesday.
	   Since the UNICEF program was launched two years ago, enrollment
in the Almora region, 270 kilometers (168 miles) north of New
Delhi, has jumped from less than a quarter of children aged five to
14 to nearly 100 percent, teachers say.
	   Across India, studies have shown that nearly half the school-age
children aren't in school _ many are working instead. The country's
adult literacy rate of about 51 percent, according to U.N. figures,
is among the lowest in the world, making basic education reforms
crucial.
	   UNICEF education consultant A.A.C. Lal said the Indian ``joyful
learning'' model would soon be implemented in other developing
countries. The program involves teaching through songs,
storytelling, games and acting, Lal said.
	   ``Our children used to trek five kilometers (to school) every
day and the dropout rate was very high,'' said Saruli Devi, a
village leader in the Almora area. ``Then we saw the effect of
`joyful learning' at the school in our neighboring village and we
approached the district authorities for help to set up a school. We
are all proud of the school and are content that our children's
future is secure now.''
	   The program is reaching more than 18,000 children in 250
elementary schools in the Almora area.
	   In addition to the difficult trip to school, Almora children may
have been skipping classes because their poverty-stricken parents
thought twice about sending to school a child who could be working,
especially if the schooling is considered poor.
	   Indian schools traditionally stress rote memorization over
creativity. Local teacher Pratap Singh Satyal said educators have
embraced the UNICEF reforms.
	   ``Teaching has become a pleasure now,'' Satyal said. ``The
earlier method was monotonous. Now this method brings out the best
in a child as well as us teachers.''
	   Lal, the UNICEF consultant, said the Almora program was the
first in which government teachers had implemented a UNICEF
project.
	   ``The success of this model ... hinged on the active involvement
of the teachers,'' Lal said.

Women activists protest attack on film depicting lesbian love

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Nearly 50 women rights activists Monday
lit candles and demanded freedom of expression outside a New Delhi
theater where a feature film about lesbian love was withdrawn after
a rampage by right-wing Hindu nationalists.
	   ``We are Indian. Lesbianism is our heritage,'' read a banner
carried by the activists from several voluntary groups in a crowded
business district.
	   Canada-based Deepa Mehta, director of the film ``Fire,'' joined
the protesters and said: ``Nobody except the courts have the right
to decide what people should see and what they should not see.''
	   She won support from top Indian film personalities who said they
would petition the Supreme court on Tuesday to demand punishment to
those attacking the movie theaters screening ``Fire.''
	   Activists from the right-wing Shiv Sena party have stormed
theaters in Bombay and New Delhi to block the screening of
``Fire.'' They call the sexual content of the film an affront to
Hindu values.
	   Fearing violence, the theater owners have discontinued screening
of the controversial film.
	   The film, with scenes of two women kissing and a brief
full-frontal nude shot, created ripples in conservative India. It
ran to packed houses for three weeks before Shiv Sena began its
violent campaign.
	   ``I believe there was public outrage initially, but there was
also public support, which I believe is a good sign,'' the film
director said.
	   Last week, the Hindu nationalists-led federal government sent
back the film to censors for a review. The film was earlier cleared
by the censors.
	   The Bharatiya Janata Party and the Shiva Sena are coalition
partners.
	   ``A pack of hooligans cannot tear down posters and force
theaters to take off the film,'' said Shabnam Hashmi of voluntary
group Sahmat.
	   Police arrested six Shiv Sena activists for allegedly tearing
posters, breaking window panes and damaging furniture at the Regal
theater in New Delhi.
	   Pramod Mahajan, the new federal information and broadcasting
minister, said Monday there was no ban on the film, but the
government would step in if any artistic work encouraged sex and
violence in the society, Press Trust of India reported.
	   ``Fire'' is the story of women in unhappy marriages to two
brothers living in New Delhi in what is called a joint family _ the
brothers, both their wives and their mother under one roof. The
sisters-in-law, seeking comfort, develops a lesbian relationship.
	   The film tackles the issue rarely addressed in India.
	   ``This is not something new we are talking about, lesbianism has
been a part of Indian culture for centuries,'' said Saritha, member
of the voluntary group Ankur. Saritha uses only one name.

U.S. envoy denounces new Bosnian Serb president

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Poplasen's statement

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) - The U.S. envoy for Bosnia
on Monday denounced the new Bosnian Serb president, saying he has
been working against the 1995 Dayton accords that ended the Bosnian
war.
	   The statement by Robert Gelbard indicates Washington's
displeasure with the extreme-nationalist President Nikola Poplasen
and raised the possibility he might be replaced by the
international officials who effectively rule Bosnia under the
Dayton agreement.
	   ``We are deeply concerned about what we have seen so far from
President Poplasen and his short few weeks in office,'' Gelbard
said in Banja Luka after he met Poplasen and acting pro-Western
Bosnian Serb Premier Milorad Dodik.
	   Poplasen's ``actions and his words have shown us that he is
against the Dayton agreement,'' Gelbard told reporters. ``He
appears to be using democratic mechanism for antidemocratic
purposes.''
	   After meeting Gelbard, Poplasen said in a statement that he was
``ready to accept any argument about the violation of the Dayton
agreement and, if it happens, do everything to put a stop to it.''

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ He compressed car wrecks, blue jeans, vegetable
crates - even fake Cartier watches - and turned them into art
prized by museums and collectors worldwide.
	   Cesar Baldaccini, the immigrant son of a cleaning lady who
became one of France's leading contemporary sculptors died Sunday
of cancer at his Paris home.
	   Cesar, as he was known, was famous for giving the French cinema
stars the coveted golden statue of excellence, the U.S. equivalent
of the Oscar. The award, first given in 1976, is called the Cesar.
	   A high-profile bon vivant on the Paris celebrity scene, Cesar
was best-known for squashing, expanding and molding the discarded
scraps of 20th century life.
	   ``Cesar has incarnated sculpture at its highest level since the
late 1950s,'' Culture Minister Catherine Trautmann said. His art,
she said, oogave us a new definition of modernity.''
	   President Jacques Chirac praised Cesar's ``strength, capacity
for renewal and force of his creative ideas.''
	   Despite the official accolades, Cesar was sometimes snubbed by
the art establishment which had criticized him in recent years for
selling out to commercial interest.
	   His famed ``Thumb'' - a reproduction of his own thumb and finger
prints - today is available in every size for every budget. One
version at La Defense corporate park outside Paris is 12 meters
high (about 40 feet).
	   ``The French estabishment always has trouble with commercial
success,'' said art critic Ann Cremin. ``Cesar was a life force.
Where ever he was there was a buzz. People gravitated to him, yet
he refused to take himself seriously.''
	   Cremin recalled how Cesar once agreed to compact the wreckage of
a friend's car after a serious accident. The friend now displays
the sculpture of the near-miss in his Paris living room.
	   ``He's France's Andy Warhol,'' she said.
	   Born Jan. 1, 1921 in Marseille, the son of Italian immigrants,
Cesar earned pocket money making sausage for the family butcher. He
quit school at 12, but went on to study art in Marseille and Paris.
	   Too poor to afford clay, Cesar would rummage through city dumps
for scrap metal to recyle into art.
	   A member of the New Realism movement, Cesar ``sculpted'' other
objects by striking them with a sledgehammer: bicycles, vegetable
crates, coffee pots. He once compacted thousands of fake Cartier
tank watches seized by French customs.
	   He also made a giant breast cast from the bosom of a dancer at
the Crazy Horse cabaret.
	   As Cesar himself put it: ``I'm not an intellectual. I like to
touch. It's my hands that make my head work.''
	   The funeral was scheduled for Thursday in a Left Bank church to
be followed by burial at the Montparnasse cemetery.
	   There was no immediate word on survivors.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin has made yet another surreal,
unconvincing attempt to show Russia and the rest of the world that
there is nothing wrong with him.
	   Yeltsin left the hospital Monday and went to the Kremlin for
three hours to dismiss aides who said what everyone knew _ The
president has health problems. Never mind that they also said
Yeltsin would and should stay in office.
	   While the rest of the world worries about Yeltsin's health, most
Russians don't seem to care. It's just not big news anymore.
	   If Yeltsin were to resign early or die in office, there would
almost certainly be presidential elections, as the constitution
stipulates.
	   Many Russians would welcome elections, saying the country needs
a strong, effective leader to tackle its problems.
	   But with Russia in the grip of the worst economic crisis since
the fall of the Soviet Union, most political leaders and aspiring
presidential candidates would prefer that Yeltsin stay in power and
take the blame.
	   Nobody has any real idea of how to tackle Russia's enormous
problems.
	   The economy is stuck between the old-Soviet system and failed
market reforms; the government's economic ministers don't know what
to do beyond begging for Western aid even though billions have
already been wasted or stolen.
	   Even the Communists, the president's most bitter opponents,
don't seem keen to have their favorite target actually leave office
any time soon.
	   Top Communist leaders too have few solutions, and little
confidence that the electorate will back them.
	   The liberal reformers, who have backed Yeltsin in the past, are
deeply divided. Discredited by the failure of market reforms, they
can't agree on a common, viable presidential candidate.
	   The top two presidential candidates have problems of their own.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who has the most powerful political
machine, is struggling to build support in the provinces, where
distrust of Moscow is strong and a major obstacle to his ambitions.
	   Nationalist leader Alexander Lebed constantly calls for
Yeltsin's removal, but still lacks the money and allies vital to
win the presidency.
	   Yeltsin has no idea of how to fix Russia's problems either. His
sole concern is clinging to power and telling everyone that he's in
charge, even if he stopped pretending long ago that he has any
solutions.
	   An ailing president who tries to rule from a hospital, some
Russians quip, is appropriate for a nation that is disintegrating.

Civilians flee fighting near Sierra Leone capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Hundreds of civilians have fled
heavy fighting between West African peacekeepers and ousted junta
soldiers and their rebel allies north of Sierra Leone's capital,
witnesses said Monday.
	   The main highway linking Freetown with the provinces has been
jammed since Sunday with mostly women and children fleeing fighting
in the towns of Lunsar and Yelleh, the reports said.
	   For the past week, the Nigerian-led West African intervention
force ECOMOG has been battling rebels based near Gberay. The
fighting continued over the weekend at Lunsar, 80 miles (130
kilometers) north of Freetown, force spokesman Paul Aghimimen said
Saturday.
	   At least 70 fighters have been killed and a swath of rebel-held
territory captured during four days of bombing raids in those
areas, Aghimimen said.
	   The Nigerian-led intervention force ousted Sierra Leone's
military junta earlier this year and returned President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah to power.
	   Although Kabbah and the ECOMOG force control the capital, former
junta soldiers and their rebel allies still control parts of the
country and have been waging a terrorist campaign against the
civilian population.
	   Bai Kumpa Bombali, a traditional leader of the town of Masiaka,
near Lunsar, said Sunday that hundreds of residents had fled in
anticipation of the rebels' arrival.
	   The rebels have been blamed by aid workers and villagers for
thousands of killings, rapes and torture of civilians in an
apparent campaign of revenge for their ouster.

	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Six Gulf Arab leaders
opened their annual summit Monday facing oil prices at historic
lows and a show of force from giant neighbor Iran in the form of
Gulf naval maneuvers.
	   For the first time, the summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council
is being attended by leaders outside the group, including U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and South African President Nelson
Mandela.
	   Annan flew in from Tunisia after he met with Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi to try to arrange the trial of two suspects in the
1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, that
killed 270 people.
	   ``We are well on the way to resolving the problem,'' Annan told
U.S. Secretary Madeleine Albright by telephone on Sunday, according
to a U.N. statement.
	   Annan has been trying to get Libya to accept a U.S.-British plan
to try the two suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the
Netherlands. Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for
failing to surrender the men for trial.
	   Mandela and Annan were apparently invited to raise the summit's
profile.
	   Summit host, the United Arab Emirates, said Sunday that trying
to stabilize erratic oil prices, which are hovering at 12-year
lows, will be the main topic of discussion at the GCC.
	   On Monday, January futures contracts for Brent crude _ a widely
watched benchmark _ fell to a record low of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on
the International Petroleum Exchange in London. Gulf oil generally
sells at a dollar or two less than Brent.

EU backs German-Italian call for international court to try Ocalan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union endorsed a call by
Italy and Germany Monday for an neutral, international tribunal to
try Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan who was arrested Nov. 15
in Rome, where he remains under police guard.
	   The EU foreign ministers issued a statement denouncing
international terrorism and Ocalan's outlawed Kurdish Workers
Party, or PKK. They also backed Italy for not extraditing Ocalan to
Turkey where he faces the death penalty there.
	   Germany, which has issued a warrant for Ocalan's arrest, has
ruled out seeking his extradition for fear of stirring unrest among
the nation's Turkish population of 2 million, one-fifth of which
are Kurds.
	   In stead, Italy and Germany want an international tribunal to
try him, a view endorsed by the other 13 EU nations, said an
Austrian official whose country currently holds the EU's rotating
presidency.
	   A full text of the EU statement was not immediately available.
	   The PKK has fought a 14-year war for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey,
in which about 37,000 people have been killed. Ocalan faces murder
and terror charges in his native Turkey and in Germany, but his
fate remains uncertain. Germany banned the PKK in 1993 after a
string of arson attacks.

Despite internal struggles, EU remains upbeat on expansion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with foreign ministers sending enlargement report to
summit; RECASTS lead graf; TRIMS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The EU foreign ministers failed to
overcome disagreements about European Union expansion Monday, yet
still tried to sound welcoming to newcomers without setting
specific entry dates.
	   The ministers failed to lift an impasse on how to fund a
near-doubling of the EU or on how fast to expand it _ issues will
dominate a two-day summit opening Friday in Vienna.
	   Yet the foreign ministers sent the summit an upbeat report,
saying efforts to bring Cyprus, 10 East European nations and,
possibly, Malta into the EU in the next decade are well on track.
	   But that did not hide a North-South split about enlargement and
what needs to be done do to make it possible.
	   Negotiations opened this fall with Cyprus, Hungary, Poland, the
Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia and preliminary talks with
slower-track candidates Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and
Bulgaria.
	   Despite prodding from the east, the EU refuses to set entry
dates to ensure candidates keep up efforts to get ready for
membership.
	   On Monday, Greece objected to Turkey being included in the
enlargement report to the summit since it is not negotiating
membership due to its dubious human rights record.
	   The first newcomers won't join until 2004 or 2005.
	   Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are expected to get in
first. The Netherlands, Germany, France and Italy have doubts about
admitting a divided Cyprus.
	   Germany and France oppose accelerating talks with Lithuania,
Latvia and Slovakia _ slow-trackers which the EU head office says
do better than expected in getting ready for membership.
	   But Britain, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden, Denmark and
Finland welcomed the idea of moving the three candidates into the
fast lane.
	   Before enlargement can occur, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands,
Sweden and France insist on a fundamental reform of EU finances.
	   They want the EU budget to rise until 2006 only in line with
inflation from this year's level of 86 billion European currency
units (dlrs 100 billion) and oppose a European Commission proposal
to link spending to economic growth, raising the budget by 20
billion ecu (dlrs 23.6 billion).
	   Spain and other southerners held out for increased membership
fees, fearful they will lose special aid deals once even poorer
easterners come into the EU.
	   Germany and other northern members say they already pay far more
into the EU than they get back and want to limit their net
contributions. Germany's net payment is 22 billion marks (dlrs 13
billion) a year.
	   Complicating the money debate is Britain's refusal to give up an
annual rebate which it has been getting since 1984.
	   Worth 2.6 billion pounds (dlrs 4 billion) this year, that rebate
was granted to offset London's net payment but its partners argue
Britain is much better off now than 14 years ago.

Johnson is moving up, at least uptown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER Jr. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Kirk Johnson is moving uptown in his third New
York fight, but the direction the unbeaten Canadian wants to take
is up _and into a heavyweight title shot.
	   After fighting twice in an armory on 23rd street in Manhattan,
Johnson will fight Tuesday night on the first boxing show ever held
in the storied Roseland Ballroom on 52nd Street.
	   ``I'm just looking to get ahead, receive some recognition and
have a shot at a world title in 1999,'' said the 26-year-old
Johnson, of Nova Scotia, who will fight Al Cole is the 10-round
featured bout.
	   Although, Johnson is 26-0, 19 knockouts, and is ranked No. 4 by
World Boxing Association, he is relatively unknown and not
seriously in the heavyeight picture because of mediocre opposition.
	   Not getting good fights, Johnson complains, has not been his
fault.
	   ``HBO offered Michael Grant (ranked No. 6 by both the WBA and
WBC) a fight with Kirk,'' said co-manager Kenny Lilien. ``We said,
`Yes.' He said, `No.''
	   In the lanky Cole, a former International Boxing Federation
cruiserweight (190 pounds) (86 kilos) champion with a 30-3 record,
with 15 knockouts, Johnson will be facing an opponent who can box
and take a punch.
	   ``He's a very tough guy who's always in condition,'' Johnson
said. ``It won't be easy.''
	   There be three other 10-round bouts on the all-heavyweight card,
two of them featuring Shannon Briggs and Obed Sullivan.
	   Briggs (30-2, 24 knockouts), of Brooklyn, New York, who upset
George Foreman and had WBC champion Lennox Lewis in trouble before
being stopped in the fifth round, will fight Marcus Rhode (23-12,
23 knockouts) of St. Joseph, Missouri.
	   Sullivan (29-3-1, 20 knockouts), of Gulfport, Mississippi, will
fight 41-year-old Jesse Ferguson (25-17, 16 knockouts), of
Knightdale, North Carolina.
	   The other 10-round match bout will match Corey Sanders (18-6, 12
knockouts) of Mitchellville, Maryland, against Jeff Wooden (18-7,
11 knockouts) of Mariana, Florida.

Ukraine's government criticizes gas giant for poor performance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's government assailed its oil and
gas giant for failing to carry out recent deals with Russia on gas
supplies and debt payments, aggravating Ukraine's energy crisis, a
news report said Monday.
	   In a special resolution, the Cabinet noted the
``unsatisfactory'' performance of the state-run Naftogaz Ukrainy
company in increasing gas payments by domestic consumers, and
charged the company with failing to fulfill government decisions
concerning the issue, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Naftogaz also has been slow in repaying Ukraine's dlrs 1 billion
gas debt to Russia, has failed to observe required gas consumption
limits, and has allowed local energy companies to steal Russian gas
from export pipelines that run through Ukraine, the government
said.
	   The resolution came several days after Russia's gas monopoly
Gazprom, Ukraine's key gas supplier, complained to the Ukrainian
government that some of the gas Russia exports to Western Europe
through Ukraine was illegally channeled by local gas companies to
domestic consumers.
	   Ukrainian consumers' gas debt to Naftogaz rose by more than 30
percent in the last two months alone, to 2.35 billion hryvna (dlrs
685 million).
	   As a result, Ukraine has come under the ``threat of remaining
without stable gas supplies during the winter,'' the Cabinet said.
	   Ukraine is facing severe energy shortages because domestic
energy plants lack cash to buy enough fuel to meet demand.
	   Ukrainian media reported last week that Russia has started to
cut gas supplies to Ukraine, prompting Ukraine's government to
order businesses throughout the country to reduce gas consumption
to the lowest possible level.
	   Ukraine is the world's sixth largest consumer of gas, and relies
on Russia for about 70 percent of its gas needs.

 &UR; Radical group deplores Clinton's visit but refrains from threats
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The radical Islamic group Hamas on
Monday denounced President Clinton's upcoming visit to the Gaza
Strip but carefully avoided making any threats against him.
	   Hamas is a bitter opponent of any peace with Israel and of the
U.S.-brokered land-for-security accord signed six weeks ago.
	   ``Of course we don't welcome him,'' Mahmoud Zahar, a spokesman
for the group, said of Clinton, who is due to travel to Gaza next
Monday. ``He brings nothing for us, or for any Palestinians ... He
is a 100 percent supporter of Israel.''
	   Zahar said in an interview with The Associated Press that
despite its opposition to the visit, Hamas had no plans to stage
attacks during it, or to target the American president.
	   ``From our side, we won't do anything. We don't believe any
aggression against this (visit) will serve our purposes,'' he said.
``We will leave him to practice his tricks.''
	   However, Hamas' political wing, of which Zahar is a senior
leader, customarily disavows prior knowledge of violent attacks by
the group's military arm, the Izzedine al Qassam brigades. In the
past several years, Hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide
bombings that have killed scores of Israelis.
	   Zahar harshly criticized the U.S. stance on an escalating
Israeli-Palestinian quarrel over the release of Palestinian
prisoners by Israel.
	   Palestinians are furious that those freed so far have been
mainly common criminals rather than so-called security prisoners _
those jailed for anti-Israel activity. The dispute has triggered
Palestinian street riots that have left dozens hurt, and hundreds
of Palestinian prisoners are on a hunger strike.
	   The Clinton administration said last week that so far, Israel
was living up to its commitments on the prisoners.
	   ``How are we to listen to this?'' Zahar said angrily.
	   Hamas has been the target of a crackdown by Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority since Oct. 29, when it tried to blow up a
school bus carrying Jewish settler children in the Gaza Strip. The
attack killed an Israeli soldier whose jeep was escorting the bus.
	   In response, Arafat put the group's spiritual leader, Sheik
Ahmed Yassin, under house arrest. Hundreds of Hamas activists were
jailed, including several senior leaders.
	   Palestinian sources say another mass roundup of Hamas activists
is likely in the days leading up to Clinton's arrival. Zahar, who
himself was freed recently after spending several weeks in prison,
said it would be ``shameful'' for Arafat to act against Hamas in
connection with the Clinton visit.
	   Asked how Hamas would respond, he said only: ``We are going to
intensify our relationship with God.''

Havel warns of racism, premier seeks ban on skinheads
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel
warned of apathy to racist violence, and the country's premier
Monday joined in a bid to outlaw the racist skinhead movement.
	   Havel met with Prime Minister Milos Zeman and other ministers of
his Social Democratic cabinet to discuss racism and xenophobia,
most of it directed against the country's Gypsy, or Roma, minority.
	   ``The situation is serious,'' Havel said. ``There is growing
apathy towards racist violence here, and we must pay increased
attention to it''.
	   Racism and xenophobia were dormant in a Communist society that
controlled any form of public expression. That has changed since
the 1989 fall of Communism here.
	   Most of the attacks against the Roma ethnic minority are taken
by the white-supremacist skinhead movement. Such attacks are often
supported by local population complaining of high crime levels
among the Romas.
	   Some 30 racist-motivated murders were recorded in this small
country of 10 million people since 1989.
	   Last year, while still in oppostion, Zeman demanded the
outlawing of the skinhead movvement.
	   ``I insist on my position today, because the skinhead movment is
a continuation of fascism in this country,'' he said.
	   Zeman said the country's secret service would monitor the
skinhead movement and a special police unit would be formed to
prevent further racist attacks.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A lioness attacked and badly injured a
worker at a Ukrainian zoo Monday after the woman entered the
animal's cage thinking it was empty, a news report said.
	   The incident occurred at a zoo in the southern city of Mykolaiv,
the Interfax news agency said.
	   The 50-year-old zoo worker suffered two broken ribs and other
injuries during the 10 minutes she spent inside the cage, the
report said.
	   The woman, whose name was not given, said she managed to survive
by staying immobile after the lioness' initial attack.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.N. peacekeepers arriving in Luanda in 2nd graf,
Kofi Annan's reaction in new 8th and 9th grafs

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The United Nations has evacuated 14
peacekeepers who were trapped by fighting between the army and the
rebel group UNITA in two towns in central Angola, a U.N. spokesman
said Monday.
	   The U.N. peace monitors _ a Swede, a Brazilian, a Senegalese,
and 11 Indians _ arrived Monday in the capital Luanda aboard a U.N.
aircraft.
	   U.N. spokesman Hamadoun Toure said the men were withdrawn Sunday
from the UNITA strongholds Andulo and Bailundo, about 290
kilometers (180 miles) southeast of Luanda, and taken to Huambo,
200 kilometers (125 miles) southwest of Andulo.
	   ``They are all well. Their morale is high, they are in good
health and good spirits,'' Toure told reporters.
	   The peacekeepers will fly from Luanda to their home countries,
according to Toure.
	   Andulo and Bailundo, where the UNITA leadership is based,
reportedly are under attack by government forces in the latest
fighting to threaten the crumbling 1994 peace accord between the
two sides.
	   The government accused UNITA of using the peacekeepers as human
shields to ward off attack. In a statement Friday, the U.N.
Security Council said it would hold UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi
personally responsible for the safety of the monitors.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed relief at the
release of the peacekeepers, saying he was encouraged ``that reason
has prevailed in the very difficult situation,'' according to his
spokesman in New York.
	   ``The secretary-general also hopes very much that the release of
United Nations personnel would encourage all concerned to proceed
with full implementation'' of the peace accord, the spokesman said.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ has yielded control of most of the
land it once held but refused to relinquish its last strongholds,
despite U.N. pressure.
	   Continuing hostility between the two sides has hindered
implementation of the peace deal, and no progress has been made
since June.
	   The government says UNITA has about 30,000 armed men hidden in
the bush of the vast southwest African nation.
	   The civil war broke out following Angola's 1975 independence
from Portugal, and some 500,000 people were killed in the fighting.

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Six Gulf Arab leaders
opened their annual summit Monday facing oil prices at historic
lows and a show of force from giant neighbor Iran in the form of
Gulf naval maneuvers.
	   For the first time, the summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council
is being attended by leaders outside the group, including U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and South African President Nelson
Mandela.
	   Annan flew in from Tunisia after he met with Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi to try to arrange the trial of two suspects in the
1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, that
killed 270 people.
	   ``We are well on the way to resolving the problem,'' Annan told
U.S. Secretary Madeleine Albright by telephone on Sunday, according
to a U.N. statement.
	   Annan has been trying to get Libya to accept a U.S.-British plan
to try the two suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the
Netherlands. Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for
failing to surrender the men for trial.
	   Mandela and Annan were apparently invited to raise the summit's
profile.
	   Summit host, the United Arab Emirates, said Sunday that trying
to stabilize erratic oil prices, which are hovering at 12-year
lows, will be the main topic of discussion at the GCC.
	   On Monday, January futures contracts for Brent crude _ a widely
watched benchmark _ fell to a record low of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on
the International Petroleum Exchange in London. Gulf oil generally
sells at a dollar or two less than Brent.

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Cardinal Carlos Oviedo, a former Roman
Catholic Archbishop of Santiago, died Monday of a heart attack. He
was 71.
	   The Catholic University Hospital said Oviedo was admitted last
week because of problems stemming from the neurological disorder
that forced him to resign as archbishop last February.
	   The archbishop suffered for years from the unspecified illness,
which gradually affected his muscles. In his final days, he could
hardly walk or talk.
	   Oviedo was named archbishop in 1990, almost simultaneously with
the restoration of civilian rule in Chile after the reign of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet.
	   After earning a bachelor's degree at the University of Chile,
Oviedo entered the Mercedarian order. As a young priest he spent
several years studying in Rome, especially at the Gregorian
University.
	   As a bishop in the northern port city of Antofagasta in the
1980s, and later in Santiago, he paid special attention to
prisoners, often visiting them.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Returning to work for a mere three hours, Boris
Yeltsin fired most of his top aides today and said he was assuming
control of two key government agencies. The shakeup removed several
aides who had publicly questioned the Russian president's health.
	   Afterward, Yeltsin went back to the government hospital where he
has been staying for the past two weeks.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin was quoted by
presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin as telling the aides.
	   The 67-year-old president will remain in the hospital as long as
necessary to fully recuperate from pneumonia, Yakushkin said.
	   The president has said almost nothing about Russia's deepening
economic problems, yet he remains extremely sensitive to any
suggestions that he's not fit to govern.
	   Yeltsin's decision to begin overseeing the Justice Ministry and
tax police was mostly symbolic, since the actual heads of those
organizations will stay in place. The move aims to step up the
fight against endemic corruption and other crime, Yakushkin said.
	   Yeltsin dismissed Chief of Staff Valentin Yumashev and his
deputies Yuri Yarov, Mikhail Komissar and Yevgeny Savostyanov.
	   ``I expressed gratitude to Yumashev while releasing him of his
duties,'' Yeltsin said in brief footage on Russian television.
``Tough discipline, order and reform is what we need.''
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff, while the
other posts remain vacant. Bordyuzha, who will retain his
presidential security council post, formerly was chief of the
Border Guards.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin dismissed the aides because of their
failure to stem crime or respond to several incidents of political
extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist deputy in
the Russian parliament.
	   ``That undermines confidence in the president and in the
government as a whole, and that is inadmissible in the current
difficult economic situation,'' the spokesman said.
	   Yeltsin has a habit of unexpected and often unexplained
dismissals. The latest round also was thought to reflect his
unhappiness over the aides' unusual candidness about his health.
	   Yumashev and other Kremlin aides openly had said that Yeltsin is
too weak to handle day-to-day affairs or to make foreign trips and
suggested he leave control of the economy and other affairs to
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   The Russian media have suggested that the aides _ who had
considerable influence since they handled the workings of the
Kremlin and the president's routine _ were eroding Yeltsin's power.
	   ``The president wanted to show who is the boss,'' said Alexander
Shokhin, the head of the pro-government Our Home Is Russia faction.
``He's like a lion who licked his wounds and now roared at those
who thought he was already out of the game.''
	   Ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky praised the president for
ridding the Kremlin of what he described as corrupt, weak
``slime,'' and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov added his support.
	   ``After every illness or holiday of the president we always
expect inexplicable personnel reshuffling,'' said Communist Party
official Valentin Kuptsov.
	   Yeltsin all but disappeared from sight when he entered a
government hospital Nov. 22 with pneumonia, the latest in a string
of health problems.
	   Many of Yeltsin's opponents claim he hasn't been seriously
involved in national affairs for a long time and is no longer fit
to lead.
	   Despite calls for his resignation, Yeltsin and his doctors
insist that the president will serve out his term, which ends in
2000.

Ex-Cabinet minister to stand trial for perjury
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Ex-Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken was ordered on
Monday to stand trial on charges of perjury connected with his
failed libel suit against a newspaper.
	   Aitken, who had been chief secretary to the Treasury in the
government of former Prime Minister John Major, had sued The
Guardian for libel over the newspaper's allegations that he had
undeclared links with Saudi arms dealers.
	   The liberal broadsheet also alleged that a Saudi businessman had
paid for a weekend's stay by Aitken at the Ritz Hotel in Paris in
1993, a breach of ethics for a government minister, when he was in
charge of Britain's arms deals.
	   Aitken testified that his wife, Lolicia, flew to Paris from
Switzerland and paid the Ritz bill in cash after he left. The
Guardian's lawyers produced airline and car rental records
indicating Lolicia Aitken never went to Paris.
	   Aitken abruptly dropped the libel suit in June 1997.
	   On Monday, Magistrate Graham Parkinson ordered him to stand
trial on charges of perjury, conspiring to pervert the course of
justice and perverting the course of justice.
	   Former Saudi business associate Said Mohammed Ayas, 56, was also
committed to stand trial jointly on the conspiracy charge as well
as a separate charge of perverting the course of justice.
	   The two men were committed to trial at the Old Bailey criminal
court in London, but no date was specified.
	   After the committal, Aitken, 56, declined to comment.

Israel refuses to extradite Polish Jew accused of atrocities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Israel has refused to extradite to Poland
a Jewish man accused of atrocities against German prisoners after
World War II, the Justice Ministry said Monday.
	   Solomon Morel, who commanded a camp for German prisoners in
southern Poland, allegedly tortured inmates and was considered
responsible for at least 1,538 deaths, according to the Justice
Ministry.
	   Poland requested Morel's extradition in April on charges of
beating and torturing prisoners and creating inhuman conditions at
the Swietochlowice camp, which he commanded from February to
November 1945.
	   Israel sent a letter last month that said it refused to
extradite Morel to Poland to face the charges. Orit Shemesh, a
spokeswoman for the Israeli Justice Ministry, said the statue of
limitations had run out on the case.
	   A spokeswoman for the Polish Justice Ministry, Barbara
Makosa-Stepkowska, said the charges against Morel failed to meet
the definition of genocide under Israeli law.
	   She said Israel's decision ends the case in Poland, which lacks
the power to appeal. Morel could only be arrested if he left
Israel, Makosa-Stepkowska said.
	   The investigation was the only one in Poland against a Jew
accused of retaliating against the Germans after their defeat.
	   Polish investigators opened the case in 1992. In seeking Morel's
extradition, they said the ``extremely bad conditions'' at the camp
included hunger, overcrowding and epidemic diseases that led to an
unspecified number of deaths.
	   Morel, who lost his parents and two brothers during the war,
moved to Israel in 1994.

Most Russians no longer worry about whether Yeltsin stays or goes

 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Yeltsin &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin has made yet another surreal,
unconvincing attempt to show Russia and the rest of the world that
there is nothing wrong with him.
	   Yeltsin left the hospital Monday and went to the Kremlin for
three hours to dismiss aides who said what everyone knew _ The
president has health problems. Never mind that they also said
Yeltsin would and should stay in office.
	   While the rest of the world worries about Yeltsin's health, most
Russians don't seem to care. It's just not big news anymore.
	   If Yeltsin were to resign early or die in office, there would
almost certainly be presidential elections, as the constitution
stipulates.
	   Many Russians would welcome elections, saying the country needs
a strong, effective leader to tackle its problems.
	   But with Russia in the grip of the worst economic crisis since
the fall of the Soviet Union, most political leaders and aspiring
presidential candidates would prefer that Yeltsin stay in power and
take the blame.
	   Nobody has any real idea of how to tackle Russia's enormous
problems.
	   The economy is stuck between the old-Soviet system and failed
market reforms; the government's economic ministers don't know what
to do beyond begging for Western aid even though billions have
already been wasted or stolen.
	   Even the Communists, the president's most bitter opponents,
don't seem keen to have their favorite target actually leave office
any time soon.
	   Top Communist leaders too have few solutions, and little
confidence that the electorate will back them.
	   The liberal reformers, who have backed Yeltsin in the past, are
deeply divided. Discredited by the failure of market reforms, they
can't agree on a common, viable presidential candidate.
	   The top two presidential candidates have problems of their own.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who has the most powerful political
machine, is struggling to build support in the provinces, where
distrust of Moscow is strong and a major obstacle to his ambitions.
	   Nationalist leader Alexander Lebed constantly calls for
Yeltsin's removal, but still lacks the money and allies vital to
win the presidency.
	   Yeltsin has no idea of how to fix Russia's problems either. His
sole concern is clinging to power and telling everyone that he's in
charge, even if he stopped pretending long ago that he has any
solutions.
	   An ailing president who tries to rule from a hospital, some
Russians quip, is appropriate for a nation that is disintegrating.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Dutch star Marc Overmars Monday became the latest
injury victim to pull out of Arsenal's European Champions Cup game
against Greek club Panathinaikos.
	   Manager Arsene Wenger pulled the talented winger from
Wednesday's game after the Dutchman aggravated a long-standing
groin injury playing in a Premier League game at Derby on Saturday.
	   Overmars joins countryman Dennis Bergkamp, French World Cup
stars Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit, defenders Tony Adams and
Nigel Winterburn on the sidelines through injury.
	   Full-back Lee Dixon and midfielder Ray Parlour are both
suspended while recent signings Fredrik Ljungberg and Fabian
Caballero are ineligible.
	   It could get worse for Wenger because defender Martin Keown and
French midfielder Remi Garde both picked up groin injuries in the
0-0 tie with Derby, the fifth game in six in which Arsenal has
failed to score.

	   COVENTRY, England (AP) _ Coventry City owner Bryan Richardson is
in danger of facing a misconduct charge after a confrontation with
referee Steve Dunn in the officials' locker room at the end of
Saturday's 2-1 loss at Wimbledon.
	   Richardson reportedly was furious with Dunn over penalty appeals
he had refused.
	   ``In my 25 years in the game I have never known a chairman go
into a referee's room before,'' Sky Blues manager Gordon Strachan
said on Monday.
	   ``My chairman did that and I'd back him up. He was an angry man.
Things happened that were not punished.''
	   Dunn said he had included Richardson's comments in his report to
the Football Association, which could respond with a misconduct
charge.

	   BLACKBURN, England (AP) _ Four days after taking his first job
as a soccer manager, former Manchester United No. 2 Brian Kidd took
his first big move at Blackburn Rovers Monday, firing long-serving
first team coach Derek Fazackerley.
	   A former center-back, Fazackerley holds the Blackburn appearance
record, playing 674 times for Rovers in 17 seasons before joining
the coaching staff in the early 1990s.
	   Kidd, who left Old Trafford on Thursday after being Alex
Ferguson's assistant for eight years, says he hopes to make a new
appointment within the next few days.

Nobel Medicine winners excited about their work
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The winners of this year's Nobel
Medicine Prize on Monday eagerly told of the explosive interest in
their discovery and tried to dampen controversy over whether
another researcher should have received the prize.
	   ''It does everything, but most of what it does we don't
understand,'' said Ferid Murad, one of three Americans who share
the 7.6-million-kronor (dlrs 950,000) prize for their work on
discovering the properties of nitric oxide, which acts as a
blood-vessel dilator.
	   Murad's statement might have sounded like a bit of forgivable
hyperbole amid the high spirits of being in Stockholm for the
presentation of the prestigious prize on Thursday. But co-laureate
Louis Ignarro talked in equally superlative terms.
	   ''I've been involved in research for about 30 years and I've
never seen another area explode as this one has,'' he told a news
conference that also included fellow laureate Robert Furchgott.
	   ''There's so many new areas to explore with nitric oxide. ...
Very soon, we'll be able to deal with the causes and novel
therapeutic strategies for coronoary artery disease, for
hypertension, for stroke, for vascular complications with
diabetes,'' he said.
	   Murad added that he believed nitric oxide could soon be applied
to relieving asthma suffering.
	   Ignarro's use of the word ''explode'' resonates deeply in the
Nobel festivities. It was the laureates' research that revealed
that nitroglycerin relieves angina pectoris pains by releasing
nitric oxide, and nitroglycerin is the key ingredient in dynamite,
the explosive invented by Alfred Nobel who established the prizes
in his will.
	   In fact, Nobel's doctor had prescribed him to take
nitroglycerin, but the Swedish inventor was skeptical, not having
the advantage of the prize-winning research.
	   After the prize was announced in October, the decision to
recognize the importance of nitric oxide, whose effects also play a
role in the anti-impotence medicine Viagra, was widely approved of.
But some said Salvador Moncada should have been one of the
laureates.
	   The criticism came from 1984 Nobel Medicine laureate Cesar
Millstein and the medical faculty of the Moncada's alma mater
University of El Salvador, among others.
	   Moncada, now at the Wolfson Institute of the University College
of London, was quoted in the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet
last week as saying the prize was a shock.
	   ''I feel terrifically frustrated about the injustice. It feels
as if my life's work has been stolen from me,'' the newspaper
quoted him as saying.
	   Asked about the controversy, Ignarro said ''the Nobel committee,
as always, have done their homework,'' but praised Moncada as ''a
brilliant scientist who has made some contributions to this area.''
	   The laureates' work ''stimulated an avalanche of research ...
and I would go so far as to say that Dr. Salvador Moncada led this
avalanche.''
	   The bodies that select the various Nobel Prize winners are bound
not to comment on their decision-making processes, other than to
state in citations why they believe the winners are deserving.
	   All the Nobel Prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary
of Nobel's death. The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway, and
the others in Stockholm.
	   This year's peace prize will be awarded to John Hume and David
Trimble for their peace efforts in Northern Ireland. Jose Saramago
of Portugal won the literature prize. The economics prize goes to
Amartya Sen for his work in analyzing the causes behind famines and
other work in the area of welfare economics.
	   Robert Laughlin, Horst Stormer and Daniel Tsui share the physics
prize for discovering how electrons can change behavior. The
chemistry prize, for developing ways of analyzing molecules in
reactions, is shared by John Pople and Walter Kohn.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The 50th birthday of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights comes none too soon _ because the world needs to be
reminded that the much-ignored document exists, the U.N. human
rights commissioner says.
	   ``We really need a celebration,'' Mary Robinson said in an
interview Monday, before joining President Jacques Chirac to kick
off a weeklong commemoration in the French capital. ``We need to
renew the vision.''
	   Robinson, the former president of Ireland who has been U.N. High
Commissioner of Human Rights for a year, said she was struck by
surveys saying only seven percent of the world knows about the
Declaration, created in the aftermath of Nazi genocide.
	   ``If people know their rights, and know that they belong to them
_ not to states _ it helps them to assert and to claim those
rights,'' she said.
	   But in fact, Robinson said, more people in the world are aware
of the hazards to the environment than the hazards to human rights.
	   ``In terms of awareness, we're about 15 years behind the
environmental lobby,'' she said.
	   Fifty years after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was
inaugurated on Dec. 10, 1948, atrocities persist, in places like
Rwanda and Bosnia, to name just a few. The first priority is to
address those gross violations, Robinson said.
	   But just as important is to focus on new areas, such as the
influential role of international corporations, she said.
	   ``Those corporations have immense power,'' she said. ``We need
to show them that human rights is in the business interest of
business.''
	   And then there is poverty _ ``such a terrible violation of so
many human rights,'' Robinson said. ``One of the strengths of the
declaration is that it recognizes economic rights, too.''
	   In a speech opening the commemoration at UNESCO headquarters,
Chirac said the celebrations were intended ``to wake up
consciences.'' He also evoked the theme of poverty.
	   ``How can we speak of universal rights when the most crucial,
the right not to be hungry, is still inaccessible to 580 million
human beings?'' he asked.
	   The weeklong celebration in Paris will draw U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the
Dalai Lama, Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng, and a host of other
dissidents, celebrities, even rock stars.
	   There will be receptions, demonstrations and a concert starring
Alanis Morissette, Peter Gabriel and Tracy Chapman, among others.
	   There already has been one controversy: newspapers reported last
week that Chirac had not included the Dalai Lama on the guest list
for a luncheon Tuesday honoring Nobel laureates, suggesting China
had pressured Chirac.
	   The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader confirmed Monday that he had
been invited and will attend.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's state-run international carrier
and the domestic airline will be controlled by a common holding
company, officials announced Monday, a step away from a possible
merger to streamline management and plug huge losses.
	   The decision was taken by the boards of Air India and the
domestic carrier Indian Airlines at a meeting in New Delhi, Press
Trust of India reported. The news agency had earlier said the
airlines were heading for a merger.
	   The two companies together employ 52,000 employees, the Air
India Officials Union said. Spokesmen for the airlines were not
immediately available for comment.
	   Air India last month asked for a 10-billion-rupee (dlrs 238
million) government bailout as well as official help in finding a
private investor to pour in another 7.7 billion rupees (dlrs 183
million).
	   The airline's managing director, Michael Mascarenhas, had then
said this was only way out of the airline's resource crunch.
	   But the Air India union predicted a merger would mean the end of
the road for the airlines. Indian Airlines is facing fierce
competition from private airlines on domestic routes.
	   Air India's management has blamed the airline's losses,
estimated at 1.47 billion rupees (dlrs 35 million) in the quarter
ending in August, on high wage bills and other ``non-operating''
costs.
	   The federal government said in September it planned to sell
stock of the two loss-making airlines.
	   The government has announced it is likely to accept the
recommendations of an official privatization agency that it divest
60 percent of the stock in Air-India to a private joint venture and
to the public.
	   The government has announced plans to sell 51 percent of Indian
Airlines as well.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and
Russia's foreign minister said today that Baghdad was again
cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors and they were optimistic
sanctions could be lifted soon.
	   Aziz maintains regular ties with Russia, which is sympathetic to
Iraq and supports the lifting of sanctions imposed by the United
Nations after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
	   ``We believe that soon the sanctions will be lifted,'' Russia's
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told a news conference after meeting
Aziz. ``We are approaching the end of a long process.''
	   Despite Ivanov's optimism, there are no signs that the United
States and Britain, the leading proponents of sanctions, are
prepared to ease their stance following repeated showdowns with
Iraq.
	   Iraq agreed to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors
last month after a confrontation that nearly led to military
strikes by the United States.
	   Aziz said he hoped ``lawful and objective inspections'' could
take place next month. And he again criticized the U.N. Security
Council for failing to lift the sanctions.
	   ``For more than seven years Iraq has been following through on
its obligations, but the Security Council hasn't been meeting its
obligations,'' Aziz said. ``This is unacceptable.''
	   While offering Iraq moral support, Russia has insisted that
Baghdad comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 687, which
calls for the dismantling of all weapons of mass destruction, the
main condition for ending the sanctions.
	   ``We are calling for the full implementation ... which should
lead to the lifting of the oil embargo,'' Ivanov said.
	   Aziz also met with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov later
in the day.
	   Primakov, who speaks Arabic fluently and has known Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein for years, has mediated between Iraq and the United
Nations on several occasions.
	   Iraq wants the embargo lifted so it can resume exporting oil at
full capacity and rebuild its shattered economy. It is now
permitted limited oil exports to buy food and medicine.
	   Russia is owed billions of dollars by Iraq and wants to help
rebuild the country's oil industry.
	   World oil prices are already sagging due to an oil glut, and if
Iraq increased its exports it could push prices even lower.

NATO foreign ministers to begin forging new strategy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Based on the lessons learned in Bosnia
and Kosovo, NATO foreign ministers on Tuesday begin forging a new
concept of strategy, expanding the traditional notion of collective
defense to include threats from weapons of mass destruction,
terrorism and regional conflicts.
	   This strategic concept, last revised in 1991, sets out the
military and political basis for NATO's mission. In reality,
however, the allies will merely fit into their guiding theory the
kind of defense it has needed since the fall of the Berlin wall a
decade ago.
	   ``NATO's primary mission will always remain defense against
aggression,'' U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright wrote
Monday in Britain's Financial Times. ``But the founders of the
alliance also distinguished between what the treaty commits us to
do and what it permits us to do.''
	   Today's threat is not a Russian tank assault across the plains
of Central Europe, but security challenges from regional conflicts
and ethnic violence like in Bosnia and Kosovo, terrorism and the
spread of weapons of mass destruction. When these threats originate
from outside NATO's traditional territory of operations, the
alliance must be prepared to deal with them.
	   ``The challenge is to bring the strategy into line with the
changing reality,'' said a senior NATO diplomat briefing reporters
before the NATO foreign ministers' meeting here Tuesday and
Wednesday.
	   The ministers will be making preparations for the NATO summit
April 24-25. Principal issues at that summit will be approval of
the new strategic concept and the welcoming of three new members,
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, as well as celebrating the
alliance's 50th birthday.
	   Albright will table a proposal at the ministerial meeting here
to set up a Center for Weapons of Mass Destruction, essentially an
intelligence-sharing center to provide greater coherence among the
allies in how this issue is assessed and addressed, officials said.
	   The plan would use existing NATO staff under a single director,
with perhaps a few additional experts, they said.
	   The Germans seem certain to bring up the nuclear first-strike
question.
	   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer made waves when he
called on NATO last month to consider dropping its doctrine
allowing a nuclear first-strike. This doctrine, reaffirmed as
recently as last year, has always been a part of NATO's nuclear
strategy and is considered an important aspect of deterrence.
	   ``The minister will certainly raise the issue,'' a German
diplomatic source said. ``We have to see that in the context of
arms control, arms reduction and nonproliferation.''
	   The Germans don't have much backing on the issue and no one at
NATO sees it as more than a speed bump on the road to the new
strategic concept.
	   The allies will assess the situation in Kosovo, the poor
southern province of Serbia where Serb security forces and ethnic
Albanian guerrillas clashed for seven months. The threat of a NATO
airstrike stopped the fighting in October and the cease-fire is
generally holding, despite sporadic outbursts.
	   The ministers also will make their six-monthly review of the
situation in Bosnia. While there may be some cosmetic changes in
the 32,000-member NATO-led force in Bosnia, no major reduction in
the troop level is seen any time soon.
	   ``Bosnia and Kosovo are recent examples that demonstrate NATO
must act when conflicts beyond its immediate borders affect
alliance interests,'' Albright wrote in her Financial Times
article. ``NATO must find the right balance between the centrality
of NATO's collective defense missions and responding to such
crises.''

Ruling coalition and opposition in deadlock
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ As the government plans to carry
through tough new economic reforms, Romania's political parties
Monday remained in a deadlock which has led to opposition lawmakers
boycotting parliament for three weeks.
	   ``We should find solutions together to recreate democratic
relations between us,'' said Ion Diaconescu, the head of the
National Peasant Party, the main force of the ruling coalition.
	   Last week, Premier Radu Vasile asked President Emil
Constantinescu to urge parliament to support tough reform measures
he plans to introduce in the next few weeks.
	   Led by Vasile, the government intends to close several
money-losing state enterprises over the next weeks. Tens of
thousands of jobs are expected to be axed.
	   Three opposition parties withdrew from parliament 20 days ago
after their attempts to stage a no-confidence vote against the
government were stymied by the majority.
	   The opposition said it would return to parliament if the
government took responsibility for alleged mistakes in the last two
years. They also asked the government to reconsider hiking food and
energy prices.
	   ``This government is lacking efficiency and responsibility and
the best solution to solve the crisis is for it to resign,'' said
Corneliu Vadim Tudor leader of the extremist Greater Romania Party,
quoted by national radio.
	   The Party of Social Democracy, the Party of National Unity and
the Greater Romania Party have 199 seats in the 486-seat,
two-chamber legislature.
	   Since reformist parties came to power two years ago, the
coalition government has been paralyzed by rifts between the four
main parties. This is the first major standoff with the opposition.
	   The ruling coalition and opposition decided to set up three
committees to analyze and solve their political disputes. Until
then, the opposition will continue to boycott parliament for
regular sessions.
	   In the last two years, purchasing power and production have
dropped, provoking street protests. Unemployment is 8.6 percent and
the salaries are often paid late. The average salary is about 1.2
million lei (dlrs 120)

Russian ruble plunges further, World Bank team arrives for talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout with Russian delegation to discuss debt
rescheduling with Paris Club, inflation estimates for 1999, other
details, ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A World Bank team came to Moscow for more loan
talks today as the battered Russian ruble headed toward a record
low since Russia's financial crisis erupted last summer.
	   The World Bank team was to reconsider the terms of a earlier
promised $1.5 billion loan for structural reform, as well as a $800
million social reform credit and a $800 million loan to streamline
the ailing coal industry, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The team will make its recommendations to the World Bank board
of directors later this month.
	   The loans are part of an IMF-led $22.6 billion bailout package
that was agreed upon before economic crisis forced the government
to devalue the ruble and default on some debts in August.
	   Russia is also seeking to reschedule at least a portion of $17.5
billion in foreign debt payments due next year. A government
delegation will leave for talks on debt rescheduling with the Paris
Club of creditor nations on Dec. 9, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported today.
	   The ruble plunged again today, hitting 20.4 to the dollar, down
0.8 rubles from Friday.
	   The ruble sold for more than 20 to the dollar shortly after the
country's economic crisis hit in mid-August before making a mild
comeback. The ruble was at about 6 to the dollar before the crisis.
	   With Russian financial markets virtually wiped out by the
crisis, the ruble has become the main indicator of economic
confidence. Its fall reflects fears that the government will flood
the economy with new cash to pay its huge debts _ a move certain to
trigger high inflation.
	   The Russian government wants to keep inflation at 30 percent
next year, but the Central Bank conceded that ``certain
conditions'' may push the inflation to up to 55 percent, Interfax
reported.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet has said it may have
to print large amounts of money if international lenders, including
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, don't release
the loan package.
	   Last week, the IMF urged Russia to provide a realistic budget
for next year as a key condition for resuming loans, but showed no
sign that it would free the money anytime soon.
	   Until the IMF acts, other foreign lenders are unlikely to give
Russia the infusion of cash it needs to pay workers, retirees and
foreign creditors.

Armenia mourns 1988 quake victims

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ All offices and factories were closed
across Armenia on Monday to mourn the 25,000 people killed in a
monster earthquake 10 years ago.
	   At 11:41 a.m. _ the time the 1988 quake had hit _ a minute of
silence was observed throughout the former Soviet republic.
	   President Robert Kocharian traveled to the towns of Spitak and
Gyumri, formerly Leninakan, where virtually every house was
destroyed by the magnitude 6.9 quake. In Spitak, 4,003 people were
killed.
	   Armenian leaders and ambassadors from all countries with
representatives in Armenia laid wreaths at the graves of 88
schoolchildren from the village of Dzhararat, 3 kilometers south of
Spitak, who were in class when their school building collapsed,
burying them under rubble.
	   ``Many countries, international charity organizations and
individuals, our Armenian Diaspora with pain in their hearts
responded to the disaster and offered their help,'' Kocharian said
in a statement released by his office Monday.
	   ``We continue to receive it even now. And though 10 years have
passed, we still feel that we need it.''
	   More than a million Armenians are estimated to live outside
Armenia, many in the United States, and many donated aid for
earthquake victims.
	   Armenia is embroiled in a bitter ethnic conflict with adjacent
Azerbaijan, which has imposed an economic blockade against and
blocked railroads to its neighboring Caucasus Mountains nation.
	   With international aid, some housing has been built for the
700,000 people who lost their homes in the quake.
	   On Monday five more two-story apartment buildings were declared
ready for people to move in. A poster hung on one of the houses
read: ``10 years of suffering, revival and faith.''
	   The quake rattled 40 percent of Armenia's territory, where 1
million people lived. Twenty-one towns and 324 villages were ruined
or heavily damaged.
	   Then-Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev cut short a summit with
U.S. President Ronald Reagan in New York to return to the Soviet
Union after the quake.
	   On Sunday, Kocharian honored 40 people who were active in
restoration work. Among them was an American from Utah, John
Huntsman, who has built a construction factory and made major
investments in Armenia's construction industry.
	   Huntsman was decorated with St. Mesrop Mashtots medal, Armenia's
highest civilian award.

Muslim region in Russia reinstates bride-prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Religious authorities in a largely Muslim region
in southern Russia have reinstated an ancient practice that
requires men to pay a woman's parents for the right to marry her, a
news report said Monday.
	   The bride-price has been set at 2,000 rubles (about 100
dollars), the ITAR-Tass news agency reported _ a significant amount
in the impoverished, restive region of Ingushetia.
	   The money must be handed over on the wedding day, and later the
husband must also provide two sets of bed linen and two sets of
clothing _ summer and winter _ for his wife.
	   Violators will be punished by being shunned by other residents
in their town or village, the report said.
	   While the practice has not been codified as a law, few
apparently dare to disobey it. Ingushetia has seen a steady
increase in the number of bachelors because many men cannot afford
to pay the 2,000 rubles, ITAR-Tass reported.

Yeltsin fires key aides during a brief break from hospital

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin roused himself from his
sickbed for three hours Monday, fired several of his top aides and
then returned to a Kremlin hospital where he is recuperating from
pneumonia.
	   It was a classic performance from the ailing president, who
rarely seems so energized as when he is firing someone. The
dismissed aides included officials who had commented recently on
the president's poor health.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin told his staff as he
delivered the news, according to presidential spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin.
	   Among those fired was Presidential Chief of Staff Valentin
Yumashev, one of Yeltsin's closest and most loyal aides. A former
journalist who was the ghost-writer of Yeltsin's memoirs, Yumashev
had served as chief of staff for nearly two years _ an eternity in
Yeltsin's Kremlin.
	   ``The president has found a way to revitalize his staff _ by
firing it,'' observed Alexander Shokhin, leader of the
pro-government bloc in parliament and, until recently, a steady
Yeltsin ally.
	   Shown on television, Yeltsin appeared animated and robust as he
scowled and delivered one of his patented tirades.
	   ``Tough discipline, order and reform is what we need,'' Yeltsin
said slowly and sternly as he glared at his staff from the head of
a long table. Aides looked down and busied themselves scribbling
notes.
	   Besides firing Yumashev and three of his deputies, Yeltsin
announced that he was personally taking charge of ``all power
ministries ... including the Justice Ministry and the tax police.''
	   ``Power ministries'' are usually defined as those related to
national defense and security. The Justice Ministry and tax police
are at the forefront of the fight against crime and corruption,
which has taken on new importance following the killing of a top
liberal leader, Galina Starovoitova.
	   Yeltsin's announcement was seen as mostly symbolic, however,
since the president already wields authority over all the
ministries included in his statement, and the ministers who head
them were left in place.
	   His remarks mostly suggested that Yeltsin is tired of being
portrayed as a figurehead who has relinquished all power to his
prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Primakov, appointed in September, has been left to
single-handedly tackle the economic crisis that has mired the
country deeper in poverty. Yeltsin has said little and done less
about the economy in the months since it went into a tailspin in
August.
	   There has been a rising chorus of calls for the president's
resignation, based on his poor health, but Yeltsin has been
defiant, insisting that he will fill out his term until it ends in
2000.
	   Yeltsin has been hospitalized with pneumonia since Nov. 22, and
Yakushkin said he would remain in the hospital as long as necessary
to recuperate. He refused to speculate about how long that would
be.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff, while the
other posts remained vacant. Bordyuzha, who will keep his security
job, was formerly chief of the Border Guards.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin had dismissed the aides because of their
failure to stem crime or respond to several incidents of political
extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist parliament
deputy.
	   ``That undermines confidence in the president and in the
government as a whole, and that is inadmissible in the current
difficult economic situation,'' Yakushkin said.
	   Yeltsin has a habit of unexpected and often unexplained
dismissals. The latest round of ousters was also thought to reflect
his unhappiness over aides' unusual candidness about his health in
recent weeks.
	   Yumashev and other Kremlin aides openly said that Yeltsin is too
weak to handle day-to-day affairs or to make foreign trips and
suggested he leave control of the economy and other current affairs
to Primakov.
	   ``The president wanted to show who is the boss,'' said Shokhin.
``He's like a lion who licked his wounds and now roared at those
who thought he was already out of the game.''

Reactor shut down in Ukraine after long repairs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW 9th graf with president lashing out at energy officials &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A nuclear reactor that was restarted last
week at the Yuzhnaya nuclear power plant after lengthy delays was
automatically shut down Monday by its safety system, officials
said.
	   The shutdown was caused by an unexpected lack of electricity
feeding the reactor's control and safety equipment, said a
spokesman at the state Energoatom company, which runs Ukraine's
nuclear power plants.
	   Plant workers were studying the cause, which did not result in
any radiation leaks, the spokesman said.
	   Yuzhnaya's reactor No. 2 was shut down in June for routine
repairs and upgrades, and was supposed to be restarted in early
October. It returned to work in full only last Friday.
	   Yuzhnaya, Ukraine's second-largest plant, is located in
Yuzhnoukrainsk, 280 kilometers (170 miles) south of the capital
Kiev. It has three VVER-1000 reactors, which are considered more
reliable than Chernobyl-type RBMK reactors.
	   Monday's shutdown was bad news for Ukraine's already overloaded
and cash-strapped energy system, which is burdened by customer
debts and increased demand for energy during the winter.
	   Ukrainian energy plants are owed more than dlrs 1 billion by
consumers and have been working below capacity since October.
	   Energy Minister Oleksiy Sheberstov has warned that his ministry
would be forced to cut off electricity to entire regions if even
one nuclear reactor is stopped. The Cabinet has been working on a
list of enterprises that would be deprived of electricity if demand
becomes dangerously high.
	   On Monday, President Leonid Kuchma lashed out at top government
officials and Sheberstov's ministry for failing to improve the
energy situation, urging them to more carefully monitor energy
supplies. He also warned that he would hold energy sector leaders
personally responsible for continued problems, Kuchma's press
service said.
	   Meanwhile, officials at two other nuclear power plants said they
are planning to extend the repairs of two reactors until the end of
December, the independent UNIAN news agency said. The two reactors
were due to go on line Dec. 6 and Dec. 10, it said.
	   Ukraine's five nuclear power plants provide for more than 40
percent of the former Soviet republic's energy needs. At least 5 of
the 14 operational reactors are undergoing repairs.

Russia calls for speedy lifting of U.N. sanctions on Iraq

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Assuming a familiar stance, Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz and Russian leaders on Monday expressed a
shared desire to see a swift end to the U.N. sanctions against the
Arab nation.
	   ``We believe that soon the sanctions will be lifted,'' Russia's
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told a news conference after meeting
Aziz.
	   Despite Ivanov's optimism, there are no signs that the United
States and Britain, the leading proponents of sanctions, are
prepared to ease their position following repeated showdowns with
Iraq over weapons inspections.
	   Russia called for a ``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's
compliance with United Nations resolutions, saying this should help
wrap up seven years of U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``This review is to lead us to the lifting of the embargo,''
Ivanov said. ``We are approaching the end of a long process.''
	   When pushing its case for sanctions relief, Iraq often turns to
Russia, which has long had good relations with Baghdad and wants to
take part in rebuilding Iraq's shattered economy.
	   Iraq agreed to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors
last month after a confrontation that nearly led to military
strikes by the United States.
	   Aziz said he hoped that ``lawful and objective inspections''
could take place next month. And he again criticized the U.N.
Security Council for failing to end the embargo placed on Iraq
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``For more than seven years Iraq has been following through on
its obligations, but the Security Council hasn't been meeting its
obligations,'' Aziz said. ``This is unacceptable.''
	   However, U.N. inspectors say Baghdad has repeatedly hidden
weapons material and information that it must turn over to win
sanctions relief.
	   Aziz also met Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who has
mediated on several occasions when Iraq and the United Nations were
in the midst of confrontations.
	   While offering Iraq moral support, Russia insists that Baghdad
comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions that call for the
dismantling of all weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq desperately wants to resume exporting oil at full capacity.
It is permitted only limited oil exports at present to buy food and
medicine.
	   Russia, meanwhile, wants to recover billions of dollars in debts
that Iraq ran up in the 1980s when it bought large quantities of
weapons to wage war with Iran.
	   Russian firms have already signed many large business contracts
with Iraq, but they can't be implemented until the sanctions are
lifted.
	   However, oil prices are already sagging due to a worldwide oil
glut, and if Iraq increased its exports, prices could fall even
lower.

Yeltsin fires key aides during a brief break from hospital

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin roused himself from his
sickbed for three hours Monday, fired several of his top aides and
then returned to a Kremlin hospital where he is recuperating from
pneumonia.
	   It was a classic performance from the ailing president, who
rarely seems so energized as when he is firing someone. The
dismissed aides included officials who had commented recently on
the president's poor health.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin told his staff as he
delivered the news, according to presidential spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin.
	   Among those fired was Presidential Chief of Staff Valentin
Yumashev, one of Yeltsin's closest and most loyal aides. A former
journalist who was the ghost-writer of Yeltsin's memoirs, Yumashev
had served as chief of staff for nearly two years _ an eternity in
Yeltsin's Kremlin.
	   ``The president has found a way to revitalize his staff _ by
firing it,'' observed Alexander Shokhin, leader of the
pro-government bloc in parliament and, until recently, a steady
Yeltsin ally.
	   Shown on television, Yeltsin appeared animated and robust as he
scowled and delivered one of his patented tirades.
	   ``Tough discipline, order and reform is what we need,'' Yeltsin
said slowly and sternly as he glared at his staff from the head of
a long table. Aides looked down and busied themselves scribbling
notes.
	   Besides firing Yumashev and three of his deputies, Yeltsin
announced that he was personally taking charge of ``all power
ministries ... including the Justice Ministry and the tax police.''
	   ``Power ministries'' are usually defined as those related to
national defense and security. The Justice Ministry and tax police
are at the forefront of the fight against crime and corruption,
which has taken on new importance following the killing of a top
liberal leader, Galina Starovoitova.
	   Yeltsin's announcement was seen as mostly symbolic, however,
since the president already wields authority over all the
ministries included in his statement, and the ministers who head
them were left in place.
	   His remarks mostly suggested that Yeltsin is tired of being
portrayed as a figurehead who has relinquished all power to his
prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Primakov, appointed in September, has been left to
single-handedly tackle the economic crisis that has mired the
country deeper in poverty. Yeltsin has said little and done less
about the economy in the months since it went into a tailspin in
August.
	   There has been a rising chorus of calls for the president's
resignation, based on his poor health, but Yeltsin has been
defiant, insisting that he will fill out his term until it ends in
2000.
	   Yeltsin has been hospitalized with pneumonia since Nov. 22, and
Yakushkin said he would remain in the hospital as long as necessary
to recuperate. He refused to speculate about how long that would
be.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff, and
Vladimir Makarov, a former KGB officer, was named to one of the
deputy posts. The others remained vacant. Bordyuzha, who will keep
his security job, was formerly chief of the Border Guards.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin had dismissed the aides because of their
failure to stem crime or respond to several incidents of political
extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist parliament
deputy.
	   ``That undermines confidence in the president and in the
government as a whole, and that is inadmissible in the current
difficult economic situation,'' Yakushkin said.
	   Yeltsin has a habit of unexpected and often unexplained
dismissals. The latest round of ousters was also thought to reflect
his unhappiness over aides' unusual candidness about his health in
recent weeks.
	   Yumashev and other Kremlin aides openly said that Yeltsin is too
weak to handle day-to-day affairs or to make foreign trips and
suggested he leave control of the economy and other current affairs
to Primakov.
	   ``The president wanted to show who is the boss,'' said Shokhin.
``He's like a lion who licked his wounds and now roared at those
who thought he was already out of the game.''

IMF resumes talks with Belarus over emergency loan

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Representatives of the International
Monetary Fund resumed talks with the Belarusian government Monday
on a dlrs 100 million emergency compensation loan.
	   The IMF had previously agreed to offer the loan if Belarus
fulfilled its recommendations for economic liberalization. The
latest talks are to discuss what the government is doing to
implement those plans, according to Yulia Lyskova, an IMF aide in
Belarus.
	   She said the talks were expected to last all week.

Kosovo Albanian negotiator: U.S. plan totally unacceptable
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. peace efforts in Kosovo
suffered a setback Monday when the chief ethnic Albanian negotiator
rejected a proposal for the future of the secessionist province of
Serbia.
	   The plan was presented by U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who has
been trying to hammer out a peace formula acceptable to both the
majority ethnic Albanians and the government of Serbia.
	   Fehmi Agani, head of the Kosovo Albanian negotiating team, said
the latest version of the U.S. peace plan was ``almost identical to
the Serbian proposal for Kosovo'' and ``cannot be considered a
basis for ... future negotiations.''
	   Agani said the previous U.S. draft for Kosovo ``envisaged the
formation of independent institutions'' in the province, although
it did not provide for independence as the majority ethnic
Albanians have demanded. The Serbs rejected that version.
	   Agani, however, said the latest U.S. proposal incorporated a
major Serb demand, which is to have Kosovo remain part of Serbia _
and within its legal system.
	   Although a de-facto cease fire generated by an agreement to end
a government crackdown in Kosovo has reduced bloodshed, there are
fears that Kosovo will again explode in fierce fighting unless a
political solution is found by spring.
	   Clashes this year pitting an alliance of Yugoslav army and Serb
police forces against rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army claimed
hundreds of lives and made more than a quarter of a million people
homeless. Serbia is the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   But Hill's efforts so far have been fruitless with the two sides
unable to agree on a formula.
	   Ivan Sedlak, a member of the Serbian government delegation for
Kosovo talks, said the government side still hasn't studied the
latest version of Hill's plan.
	   Sedlak said a previous version was unacceptable because it
defined Kosovo virtually as a separate state. But Sedlak did not
comment on the reworked draft.
	   A previous version of the U.S. draft was rejected by Serbia
because it gave the republic almost no control over Kosovo. But
that formula was cautiously greeted by ethnic Albanian negotiators
and the guerrillas gave a mixed response, with one faction not
ruling it out as an interim solution, and the other rejecting it.
	   ``We had some objections to the previous version too, but this
one is totally unacceptable,'' Agani told Glas. ``It is obvious
that Hill offers one solution after talking to us and another after
talking to (Serbian president Milan) Milutinovic.''
	   It was not clear what changes were made to the previous draft,
but Agani's criticism suggested the reworked version gave Serbia
more authority in Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who make up more than 90 percent of Kosovo's
population, overwhelmingly seek independence from Serbia.

Top Bosnian Serb in custody pleads innocent to genocide charges

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A top Bosnian Serb general pleaded
innocent Monday to charges that he played a pivotal role in a 1995
orgy of killing described as Europe's worst civilian massacre since
World War II.
	   Prosecutors allege that Gen. Radislav Krstic commanded Bosnian
Serb troops who massacred thousands of Muslims as they sought
shelter in the U.N.-protected ``safe haven'' of Srebrenica in
eastern Bosnia.
	   Krstic, the most senior Bosnian Serb suspect in U.N. custody,
listened carefully Monday as his 13-page genocide indictment was
read at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal.
	   Then, as each of six charges was put to him, he calmly and
confidently responded: ``I plead not guilty.''
	   He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted of
any one of the charges, which cover allegations of genocide,
extermination, murder and persecution. A trial date has not been
set.
	   Krstic, wearing a green suit, white shirt and tie, was allowed
to remain seated as he entered his pleas. His lawyer, Belgrade
attorney Nenad Petrusic, told presiding Judge Claude Jorda of
France that Krstic was suffering from serious injuries which made
it difficult for him to stand up. Krstic lost part of his right
leg, reportedly after stepping on a mine in 1994.
	   Petrusic described Krstic's health as ``truly, seriously
imperiled,'' and said there was a chance of gangrene where the limb
was amputated.
	   Asked by Jorda how he felt, Krstic said: ``As well as can be
expected on the whole, but I am tired after the arrest.
Exhausted.'' Krstic also complained that there was no heating in
his U.N. cell and that he was receiving no therapy for his injured
leg.
	   But he added that he had been treated well since his arrest last
Wednesday in northern Bosnia by U.S. troops serving in the NATO-led
Stabilization Force.
	   Krstic, reportedly a close associate of former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military leader Gen. Ratko
Mladic, is accused of helping to plan and carry out the July 1995
massacre of thousands of Muslims in Srebrenica.
	   Both Karadzic and Mladic also face genocide charges alleging
that they masterminded the slaughter, but neither is in custody.
	   According to the indictment, forces under Krstic and Mladic
``either expelled or killed'' almost every Bosnian Muslim in the
enclave using automatic weapons, hand grenades and other weaponry.
	   In Karadzic and Mladic's indictments, prosecutors estimate that
some 6,000 Muslims, mostly civilians, were killed at Srebrenica _
making it Europe's worst civilian massacre since the Holocaust.
	   Krstic's indictment, issued in October and publicized only after
his arrest, describes the killings as ``wide-scale and organized.''
The indictment had been kept secret to prevent Krstic from going
into hiding.
	   Muslims were assembled at locations including a warehouse and
schools before being summarily executed, prosecutors claim.
	   Krstic's troops also allegedly plowed victims into mass graves
in a hasty attempt to conceal the slaughter. They later dug up the
bodies and reburied them elsewhere when the international community
learned of the killings, prosecutors allege.
	   The tribunal was established in 1993 by the U.N. Security
Council to prosecute genocide and war crimes stemming from the
armed clashes that marked the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.

Ukraine's government criticizes gas giant for poor performance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's government assailed its oil and
gas giant for failing to carry out recent deals with Russia on gas
supplies and debt payments, aggravating Ukraine's energy crisis, a
news report said Monday.
	   In a special resolution, the Cabinet noted the
``unsatisfactory'' performance of the state-run Naftogaz Ukrainy
company in increasing gas payments by domestic consumers, and
charged the company with failing to fulfill government decisions
concerning the issue, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Naftogaz also has been slow in repaying Ukraine's dlrs 1 billion
gas debt to Russia, has failed to observe required gas consumption
limits, and has allowed local energy companies to steal Russian gas
from export pipelines that run through Ukraine, the government
said.
	   The resolution came several days after Russia's gas monopoly
Gazprom, Ukraine's key gas supplier, complained to the Ukrainian
government that some of the gas Russia exports to Western Europe
through Ukraine was illegally channeled by local gas companies to
domestic consumers.
	   Ukrainian consumers' gas debt to Naftogaz rose by more than 30
percent in the last two months alone, to 2.35 billion hryvna (dlrs
685 million).
	   As a result, Ukraine has come under the ``threat of remaining
without stable gas supplies during the winter,'' the Cabinet said.
	   Ukraine is facing severe energy shortages because domestic
energy plants lack cash to buy enough fuel to meet demand.
	   Ukrainian media reported last week that Russia has started to
cut gas supplies to Ukraine, prompting Ukraine's government to
order businesses throughout the country to reduce gas consumption
to the lowest possible level.
	   Ukraine is the world's sixth largest consumer of gas, and relies
on Russia for about 70 percent of its gas needs.

	   LAREN, Netherlands (AP) _ A Dutch ``Santa'' who dished out more
than candy and gifts in a bar was arrested for punching a fellow
patron in the mouth.
	   A man dressed as Sinterklaas _ the Dutch forerunner of Santa
Claus _ dropped into a bar in this central Dutch town Saturday
night for a glass of wine.
	   After getting into an argument with another drinker, Sinterklaas
_ known to children as the ``Good Holy Man'' _ punched the man in
the mouth, knocking out one of his teeth, the daily De Telegraaf
reported Monday.
	   Sinterklaas, whose real name was not released, left the bar but
was arrested by police in another bar.
	   On Dec. 5, the eve of St. Nicholas' feast day, Sinterklaas,
helped by his minstrel-like Moorish helper Black Pete, visits Dutch
schools bearing gifts and candies.

Despite internal struggles, EU remains upbeat on expansion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statement on enlargement &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The EU foreign ministers failed to
overcome disagreements about European Union expansion Monday, yet
tried to sound welcoming to newcomers even without setting specific
entry dates for them.
	   The ministers failed to lift an impasse on how to fund a
near-doubling of the EU or on how fast to expand it _ issues will
dominate a two-day summit opening Friday in Vienna.
	   Yet they sent the summit an upbeat report, saying efforts to
bring Cyprus, 10 East European nations and, possibly, Malta into
the EU in the next decade are well on track.
	   That did not hide a North-South split about enlargement and what
needs to be done do to make it possible.
	   Negotiations opened this fall with Cyprus, Hungary, Poland, the
Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia and preliminary talks with
slower-track candidates Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and
Bulgaria.
	   Despite prodding from the east, the EU refuses to set entry
dates to ensure candidates keep up efforts to get ready for
membership.
	   In a statement, the foreign ministers lauded the ``inclusive and
dynamic nature of the enlargement process'' and saaid as a whole
candidates were making good progress getting in shape for
membership.
	   Greece objected to Turkey being mentioned since it is not
negotiating membership due to its dubious human rights record. The
statement ended up saying that the approach to see Turkey as a
full-fledged candidate in the future was ``generally shared'' by
the EU governments.
	   The first newcomers won't join until 2004 or 2005.
	   Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are expected to get in
first. The Netherlands, Germany, France and Italy have doubts about
admitting a divided Cyprus.
	   Germany and France opposed accelerating talks with Lithuania,
Latvia and Slovakia _ slow-trackers which the EU head office says
do better than expected in getting ready for membership.
	   Before enlargement can occur, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands,
Sweden and France insist on a fundamental reform of EU finances.
	   They want the EU budget to rise until 2006 only in line with
inflation from this year's level of 86 billion European currency
units (dlrs 100 billion) and oppose a European Commission proposal
to link spending to economic growth, raising the budget by 20
billion ecu (dlrs 23.6 billion).
	   Spain and other southerners held out for increased membership
fees, fearful they will lose special aid deals once even poorer
easterners come into the EU.
	   Germany and other northern members say they already pay far more
into the EU than they get back and want to limit their net
contributions. Germany's net payment is 22 billion marks (dlrs 13
billion) a year.
	   Complicating the money debate is Britain's refusal to give up an
annual rebate which it has been getting since 1984.
	   Worth 2.6 billion pounds (dlrs 4 billion) this year, that rebate
was granted to offset London's net payment but its partners argue
Britain is much better off now than 14 years ago.

One killed and at least five injured in bomb blast in Algiers

	   ALGIERS, Algeria _ A bomb exploded near a market in Algiers on
Monday, decapitating one person and injuring at least five people,
eyewitnesses and an official communique said.
	   The person killed had been carrying the bomb, according to
merchants, who spoke on condition of anonymity, at the Triolet
market in the Bab El Oued district of Algiers.
	   A communique issued by the security forces after the blast said
one person had died and five were injured, two of them seriously.
An unofficial source who had contacted the nearby Maillot hospital
and spoke on condition of anonymity, said six people had been hurt.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the bombing, the latest in a
wave of attacks ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which
begins Dec. 20.
	   More than 70 people have been killed since the beginning of
December.
	   Algerian authorities on Sunday said Islamic militants had
slashed the throats of seven people in a mountain town overnight.
	   The deaths are the latest in a round of attacks in the nearly
seven-year-old insurgency against the military-backed government
that has claimed more than 75,000 lives.
	   The insurgency erupted after the government canceled January
1992 elections the now bannned Islamic Salvation Front was expected
to win.
	   Algeria's Prime Minister went on television Sunday to assure the
nation that the seven-year-old insurgency was under control and
that his economic reforms were bearing fruit.

`Bye Bye America' packs them in, giving Iraqis chance to laugh

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ After the tattered curtains part at the
Sheherezad Theater, it takes all of about 15 seconds to grasp that
Baghdad's most popular play is, well, playing to its audience.
	   To the frenzied strains of an Arab pop song, there's a
cross-dressing bellydancer, seductively clad women, a government
official wiggling and jiggling _ and the suggestion of drink and
drugs in the office of the Kuwaiti Ministry of Animal Resources.
	   Onstage come a secretary who works as a pimp, an effeminate
deputy minister who loves his wine as well as his women, and his
boss, who goes nowhere without an escort of prostitutes.
	   The plot?
	   Tucked in with dancing, stand-up routines and a few ballads is
the story _ sort of _ of the ministry's plan to buy an American
bull for the outrageous price of dlrs 115 million to improve the
gene pool of Kuwait's livestock.
	   ``Bye Bye America'' has packed in theatergoers in its wild
two-week run. Its target, obviously enough, is the Kuwaiti
government, with some barbed attacks on America's sway over the
Arab Gulf regimes. And the audience, howling throughout, loves it.
	   The play is the latest in a string of productions that have
transformed Iraq's once-dormant theater scene into a thriving arena
for artistic expression that is often daring and always ribald.
	   From just two playhouses a decade ago to 20 today, theater
stands as one of the few bright spots on Baghdad's bleak cultural
landscape, where U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait
in 1990 have impoverished most Iraqis.
	   At times, the stifling hand of President Saddam Hussein has
meant that his ubiquitous portraits are one of the few visible
signs of artistic creativity.
	   Often the lines of popular plays are quoted in cafes, and
tickets for some shows on the weekends can be scalped for five
times the price of 1,000 diners, or 55 cents.
	   The laughs don't just come at the expense of Kuwait, either.
	   The bribes and bureaucracy that torment Iraqis are often the
butt of jokes. One play, ``A Party for a Respectful Person,''
skewered an Iraqi official for obstructing the permits that Iraqis
need to travel and to sell and buy a house.
	   Some criticism is even bolder, the kind of stuff that would
never appear in Iraq's staid newspapers.
	   In one, ``Playground of the Hypocrites,'' an Iraqi is detained
and politely asked to sit down by his interrogator. He is then told
to confess. But, he asks, where is the boiling oil, the whips and
the ceiling fan he should be hanging from?
	   When told there's nothing of the sort, he warns his
interrogator, ``They're going to fire you!''
	   All the plays are comedies, and in that is their saving grace,
providing an officially sanctioned outlet for mounting frustration.
	   ``Life used to be much easier, and now all that is cut off,''
said Sabah Atwan, the writer of ``Bye Bye America.'' ``Iraqis feel
they are suffocating with the sanctions, and the theater gives them
the lungs they can breathe with.''

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Cardinal Carlos Oviedo, a former Roman
Catholic Archbishop of Santiago, died Monday of a heart attack. He
was 71.
	   The Catholic University Hospital said Oviedo was admitted last
week because of problems stemming from the neurological disorder
that forced him to resign as archbishop in February.
	   The archbishop suffered for years from the unspecified illness,
which gradually affected his muscles. In his final days, he could
hardly walk or talk.
	   Oviedo was named archbishop in 1990, almost simultaneously with
the restoration of civilian rule in Chile after the reign of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet.
	   After earning a bachelor's degree at the University of Chile,
Oviedo entered the Mercedarian order. As a young priest he spent
several years studying in Rome, especially at the Gregorian
University.
	   As a bishop in the northern port city of Antofagasta in the
1980s, and later in Santiago, he paid special attention to
prisoners, often visiting them.

Russian ruble plunges further, World Bank team arrives for talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, UPDATES with figures on debts, money printed,
other details. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The arrival of a World Bank team Monday for more
loan talks did little to assuage fears that Russia will be left
without foreign aid, and the ruble resumed its slide toward a new
low.
	   The ruble rate has been the main indicator of economic
confidence since Russian financial markets were virtually wiped out
in August, and its fall reflected fears that Russia will begin
printing large sums of money to pay off its debts and cover the
budget deficit.
	   Substantial money-printing is certain to trigger high inflation.
	   Russia printed 3.5 billion rubles (dlrs 172 million) in October,
and 10 billion rubles (dlrs 490 million) in November to cover the
deficit, Central Bank deputy head Tatyana Paramonova said Monday,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   But the government has warned it would have to print much more
if no foreign aid arrives, and traders said Monday the Central Bank
may already have printed more money than it is willing to admit.
	   Russia's foreign debt will total dlrs 143.9 billion on Jan 1,
Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Monday, according to
Interfax.
	   Of this, dlrs 17.5 billion in servicing costs is due next year,
but Russia says it doesn't have the money and needs to reschedule
some of the debt. A government delegation will leave Dec. 9 for
rescheduling talks with the Paris Club of creditor nations, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported Monday.
	   Russia had hoped to cover the debt payments by dipping into the
dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package that the International Monetary
Fund put together in July. But the loan was frozen after Russia's
financial weaknesses and the global economic crisis prompted the
government to devalue the ruble and default on some debts in
August.
	   The World Bank team that arrived Monday was to reconsider the
terms of several loans promised in the IMF-led loan package,
including dlrs 1.5 billion for structural reform and dlrs 800
million to streamline the ailing coal industry, Interfax reported.
	   The team will make recommendations to the World Bank board of
directors later this month, when it discusses its plans for Russia.
	   However, until the IMF acts, other foreign lenders are unlikely
to give Russia money.
	   And the IMF is urging Russia to provide a realistic budget for
next year as a key condition for resuming loans, and is showing no
sign that it will free the money any time soon.
	   Meanwhile, the ruble plunged in Monday trading, and hit 20.4 to
the dollar in the official Central Bank rate _ down 0.8 rubles from
Friday.
	   The ruble sold for more than 20 to the dollar shortly after the
crisis hit in August before making a mild comeback. The ruble was
at about 6 to the dollar before the crisis.
	   Traders said that the ruble's slide on Monday was slowed by
interference from the Central Bank _ which spends its hard-currency
reserves to buy rubles, thus increasing the demand and driving the
ruble rate back up.

Government forces kill 60 rebels in Republic of Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Government forces and
rebel militia fought pitched battles Monday in the Republic of
Congo near the site of a failed ambush Saturday that left 60 rebels
dead, a senior military official said.
	   Combat was taking place in the Mindouli district, 25 kilometers
(15 miles) away from the southern rebel stronghold of Ntadi.
	   An Information ministry official who confirmed the report told
The Associated Press that the situation was rapidly deteriorating.
The official, who also spoke anonymously, said the so-called Ninja
rebels had infiltrated Mindouli via a railway link.
	   It appeared the rebels were linked to those involved in
Saturday's failed ambush, the scene of bloody weekend clashes that
killed 60 rebels and at least three government soldiers were also
killed, the state Congolese Information Agency reported Monday.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed and conflicting
reports of the incident gave much higher casualties on the
government side.
	   Troops have since been deployed to the region to beef up
security.
	   Ntadi, about 175 kilometers (100 miles) from Brazzaville is
close to Mindouli where the Ninja rebels gunned down 45 worshipers
about two weeks ago.
	   The killings are the latest in a growing number of attacks on
civilian and government targets in the southern Republic of Congo.
	   Dozens of officials have been killed over the past few months,
news reports say.
	   The Ninjas have links to former Prime Minister Bernard Kolelas,
a sometime-ally of ousted president Pascal Lissouba.
	   Both fled the country after President Denis Sassou-Nguesso
defeated Lissouba in a five-month civil war last year, but the
Ninjas have resisted disarmament and are waging a campaign against
Sassou-Nguesso's government.
	   Since his takeover, Sassou-Nguesso has outlawed all militia
groups including his own Cobras.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Dozens of Ukrainian opposition party
activists and lawmakers demonstrated Monday near the Swiss Embassy
in Kiev to protest the arrest of their leader in Switzerland on
money-laundering charges.
	   The protesters, from the centrist Hromada movement, held
placards that read: ``Hands off the leader of Hromada!'' and
``Switzerland, stop playing political games!''
	   Hromada chief and former Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko, 45, who
is now a lawmaker in the Ukrainian parliament, was detained last
Wednesday as he drove from France into Switzerland. Swiss
authorities charged him in a money-laundering scheme on Friday.
	   According to investigating Judge Laurent Kasper-Ansermet, a
``relatively large'' sum of money had been seized in Geneva in
connection with the charges against Lazarenko.
	   Last month, Swiss federal police announced that Switzerland was
helping Ukrainian authorities track down money Lazarenko allegedly
stashed in Swiss banks. Switzerland has handed over some bank
documents to Ukraine, and investigations are underway in several
Swiss states.
	   Ukrainian authorities are already investigating whether
Lazarenko and other Hromada leaders have been involved in
corruption.
	   Lazarenko was prime minister from 1996 to 1997, and was
dismissed by President Leonid Kuchma. Critics say Lazarenko reaped
huge profits from the distribution of natural gas supplies in the
former Soviet republic when he served as prime minister, but he and
his allies deny the charges.
	   Lazarenko says the authorities want to discredit him before
presidential elections in October 1999, and he has even accused
Kuchma's close entourage of plotting to kill him.
	   Lazarenko's party fared well in parliamentary elections this
year and he was widely considered a top contender in the future
presidential race. His arrest appears to deal his chances a severe
blow.
	   Several Hromada legislators from among Monday's protesters met
with the Swiss ambassador, presenting the embassy with a letter
that said Lazarenko's arrest was a ``planned action of reprisal
against a politician whose party is in the opposition,'' the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Lazarenko's initial term of arrest is eight days. A hearing is
expected this week and Kasper-Ansermet, the judge, has said he
would ask to detain the Ukrainian politician until trial.
	   Kasper-Ansermet arrived in Ukraine on Monday evening accompanied
by Swiss investigators who plan to collect evidence in Lazarenko's
case, Interfax said.

Swiss man loses snowball fight with bears
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ A man had to be rescued by firefighters
Monday when he climbed into the Swiss capital's historic bear pit
and pelted two bears with snowballs, city police said.
	   The 35-year-old, who wasn't identified, was taken to hospital
with ``considerable flesh wounds'' to his legs and shoulder after
climbing into the enclosure and throwing snowballs at the two
bears, named Selma and Urs.
	   Despite bystanders'attempts to distract her with food, the
female bear grabbed him by the shoulder and dragged him into her
cage, police added.
	   The bear let go of the intruder only when her keeper banged on
the bars of the cage with a metal object.
	   The city's name derives from the German word for bears and the
animal features on its coat of arms. Bears have been kept in the
bear pits since the 15th century.

	   HOLLYWOOD, Florida (AP) _ Joe DiMaggio suffered a serious
setback over the weekend in his recovery from lung cancer surgery,
his doctor said Monday.
	   ``Joe has had a significant and serious turn for the worse,''
Dr. Earl Barron told The Associated Press. ``The outlook has dimmed
over the past 72 hours. He's not in good shape.''
	   Barron said DiMaggio's lung infection had returned and that he
had developed a fever.
	   ``He is being treated with antibiotics and his blood pressure is
being maintained with medications,'' the doctor said.
	   DiMaggio, a Hall of Fame baseball player, remains in intensive
care where he has been for much of the time since entering the
hospital on Oct. 12. He underwent surgery to have a malignant tumor
removed from his right lung two days later.
	   ``I saw him this morning,'' Barron said. ``We are continuing
supportive care. The outlook is not as good as it was a few days
ago.''

Embattled Netanyahu government faces showdown in parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Facing possible defeat over a bill calling for
early elections, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought
to buy time Monday as he decided whether to put off the vote until
next week.
	   The bill is considered an indicator of parliamentary
dissatisfaction with Netanyahu and it highlighted the premier's
struggles to hold together his crumbling coalition over the latest
Mideast land-for-peace agreement Israel signed with the
Palestinians.
	   A majority in the Israeli parliament Monday appeared ready to
vote for the bill submitted by the opposition Labor party to
dissolve the Knesset and call elections.
	   A preliminary reading in August passed and the bill would need
to pass three additional readings before the parliament was
dissolved and new elections were called.
	   To buy time before the first reading was voted on, Netanyahu
held marathon negotiations with hard-line coalition members and
sent Deputy Minister Michael Eitan to the Knesset floor to start a
filibuster. Eitan once set an Israeli record for filibusters,
remaining on the podium for 11 hours.
	   Meanwhile, Netanyahu considered turning the vote on the bill
into a no-confidence motion. That would delay the vote for a week,
providing more time for him to try to shore up his wavering
coalition and hold his 61-59 majority.
	   Netanyahu has been embroiled in political crisis since he signed
the accord in October to cede more West Bank land to the
Palestinians against the wishes of a majority of his coalition
members.
	   The latest turmoil comes less than a week before U.S. President
Bill Clinton is to arrive, to preside over the next phase of the
accord. However Netanyahu has frozen further troop withdrawals
saying the Palestinians have violated the accord.
	   In suspending progress however, Netanyahu lost the safety net in
parliament the dovish labor party guaranteed it would provide in
order to ensure the government remained in power as long as it was
implementing the accord.
	   Labor party leader Ehud Barak said a vote to bring down the
Netanyahu government would not halt the peace process.
	   Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi argued that if Netanyahu is not
given a majority to implement the withdrawals, ``the peace process
will have to wait until the new elections,'' he told The Associated
Press.
	   The Israeli parliament was also due to consider changing the
country's electoral system back to the previous method. Netanyahu
is Israel's first directly-elected prime minister. Israelis cast
two ballots in 1996, one for prime minister and one for a party to
be represented in the parliament, instead of a single ballot for a
party as in the past.
	   Authors of the bill withdrew it at the last moment, fearing that
it would not get the support of an absolute majority of members as
required for passage.
	   Analysts say the new system has destroyed the power base of the
two main Israeli parties, Netanyahu's Likud and Barak's Labor,
opening the door to dozens of small single interest parties that
wield a disproportionate amount of power in coalition governing.

Nigerian apologizes for tossing jersey at coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Taribo West, under threat of a fine and
possibly a transfer, apologized Monday for pulling off his jersey
and throwing it at Internazionale of Milan coach Mircea Lucescu
after the Nigerian was removed from a match.
	   ``I know I did something stupid. ... I wasn't able to control
myself _ that's my temper,'' the defender said. ``I am not a child,
so it won't happen again. But I am a human being and right then I
was angry.''
	   The incident happened in the 52nd minute of Inter's Italian
League match Sunday at Vicenza, when Lucescu, who was hired last
week to replace the fired Luigi Simoni, replaced West with French
defender Mickael Silvestre.
	   As West approached the sideline, he tore off the jersey and
tossed it at Lucescu, then headed for the locker room. Silvestre,
meanwhile, went on to score in the dying seconds to lift Inter into
a 1-1 draw.
	   Inter is weighing punishment for West, who joined the club
before last season and helped it win the UEFA Cup. Media reports
said a fine of 50 million lire (dlrs 30,000) is being considered.
The team is also looking into trade offers, with English clubs
Newcastle and Liverpool rumored to be the likeliest destinations.
	   ``Fines are nothing new for me,'' joked West, 24, who was docked
an undisclosed sum for showing up late to training camp this
summer. ``It wouldn't surprise me if the club decides to sell me. I
will accept any decision. I'd like to stay at Inter, but life goes
on.
	   ``I know I made a mistake. I'm sorry for losing my head. But
having apologized to everyone, now I need to resolve this problem
inside me,'' he added. ``I'm more afraid of God's punishment than
of what the club might do.''

Official: Russian December tax revenues to reach 11 billion rubles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's cash-poor government hopes to collect at
least 11 billion rubles (dlrs 539 million) in taxes in December, an
official said Monday.
	   Sergei Shulgin, deputy head of the Federal Tax Service, said the
tax collection data for November hasn't been calculated yet, but he
expects the number to be ``around the same levels as October.''
	   The tax service collected 13.8 billion rubles (dlrs 863 million
at the time) in October.
	   Problems with tax collection have plagued Russia for years and
now that the country is mired in its worst economic crisis since
the 1991 Soviet collapse, the government is particularly eager to
boost tax revenues.
	   Shulgin also said tax collections for the first 10 months of
this year were 36 percent above target _ but he didn't indicate
whether that was based on tax goals set before or after the Aug. 17
devaluation of the ruble. The ruble has lost nearly 70 percent of
its value since then, but tax collection targets have been
frequently adjusted since then.
	   The government recently approved a plan for overhauling Russia's
tax system, including a reduction of the profit tax from 35 percent
to 30 percent, and an introduction of a sale tax.
	   ``We need to free up companies' profits so they can invest in
their production facilities,'' Shulgin told a news conference
Monday.
	   The government also wants to reduce the value-added tax from 20
percent to 15 percent in 1999 and to 10 percent in 2000.
	   The tax service has estimated that the reduction of the VAT will
result in a loss of 20 billion rubles (dlrs 980 million) in budget
revenues next year, but the combined effect of the tax reform would
be a 40 billion-ruble increase in the gross domestic product, to
100 billion rubles in 1999, Shulgin said.
	   However, uncertainty over the likely size of Russia's economy
next year makes any judgments about the effects of tax cuts on the
GDP unreliable.

Lens loses appeal over Vairelles suspension
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ UEFA on Monday rejected an appeal by French
champion Lens against a suspension imposed on winger Tony
Vairelles.
	   Vairelles was given the one-match suspension for ``unsporting
behavior'' during Lens' 1-0 Champions League win against Arsenal at
Wembley last month.
	   UEFA's appeals body rejected the protest by Lens, ruling that
suspensions of up to two matches can't be appealed.
	   Arsenal midfielder Ray Parlour was sent off in the final minute
for striking out at Cyril Rool. He was followed a minute later by
Vairelles for a foul challenge on Lee Dixon.
	   Although Dixon was not booked by referee Anders Frisk, UEFA
ruled he started the trouble by elbowing Vairelles in the back.
	   Parlour and Dixon were suspended for at least one European
match.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian police opened fire Monday on
rioters protesting Israel's refusal to release Palestinian
prisoners _ the first sign that the Palestinian police were
containing violence in advance of President Bill Clinton's visit
next week.
	   Protests on the prisoner issue swept through the West Bank, both
in Israeli-controlled and Palestinian-controlled areas. A settler
opened fire on rioters on a major road to Jerusalem, and two youths
were injured _ one critically.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who hailed Clinton's upcoming
trip as ``historical and great,'' is anxious to show that the
Palestinians are meeting the conditions of the U.S.-brokered accord
reached at Wye River in Maryland in October.
	   In Palestinian-controlled Nablus, loyalists of Fatah _ a
movement started Arafat _ surrounded the police station and began
lobbing stones and fire bombs into the police station. They torched
police vehicles and tried to storm the gates of the prison.
	   Police opened fire on the protesters, injuring at least seven,
according to hospital sources.
	   The Fatah protest had been prompted by the methods club-wielding
riot police had used earlier in the day by police against mothers
of prisoners who were demonstrating to press Arafat to pressure
Israel to release prisoners.
	   Clinton will visit Gaza _ the first sitting U.S. President to do
so _ and open a meeting of the Palestinian National Council.
Palestinians and Israelis alike see the visit as tacit endorsement
of Palestinian hopes of statehood.
	   The Palestinians exhibited confiscated weapons to CIA officials
on Monday in an effort to prove that they are meeting Wye's
security commitments.
	   Netanyahu, who has accused the Palestinian Authority of
stage-managing the riots, was not enthusiastic about the Clinton
visit.
	   ``I hope Mr. Clinton uses his visit to demand Palestinian
compliance,'' he told Israel television.
	   The Palestinian Authority _ which denies accusations that it
backs the rioters _ has accused Netanyahu of fanning the flames by
reneging on a prisoner release commitment achieved at Wye.
	   Israel released 250 prisoners last month, but most were common
criminals, instead of the security prisoners the Palestinians had
hoped through. Netanyahu insists that he will not release the
security prisoners, whom he describes as murderers.
	   The prisoners have gone on a hunger strike that they say
encompasses all 3,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails. The Israel
Prisons Service knows of only 514 strikers.
	   There were at least five riots in the West Bank Monday.
Palestinian students _ some toting their homework in schoolbags _
ambushed cars with stones on the road between the Maaleh Adumim
settlement and Jerusalem.
	   Settler David Adawi opened fire from a van. Two students were
injured, one critically _ Nasr Erekat, 20, a first cousin of top
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   It was a repeat of a situation last week when a soldier fended
off blows after stone-throwing Palestinians managed to disable the
car he was in near Ramallah. But in that case, Cpl. Assaf Meyara
did not use his gun, and instead ran away.
	   His actions _ filmed and photographed _ were excoriated by many,
including Netanyahu.
	   ``If a soldier or civilian is caught in a life-threatening
situation, it is his right and even his obligation to save himself
in accordance with the law,'' he said.
	   The fact that both Meyara and Adawi are now both under police
investigation and may face charges for taking opposite tacks when
under attack could fuel the increasing perception that the peace
process is adrift.
	   Both television news drew comparisons between the incidents,
both caught on video.
	   ``Suddenly 100 to 200 Arabs with big stones surrounded us around
the car,'' said Adawi's driver, who would only give his name as
Michael, told Associated Press Television. ``They want to kill
us.''
	   The mixed signals over how to behave when under attack reflects
a wider confusion over the peace process. The accord between the
Israelis and Palestinians after the Wye talks quickly deteriorated
into mutual recriminations.
	   Israel's opposition _ which sought support for an early
elections bill in the parliament on Monday _ blamed Netanyahu's
struggle to keep his coalition afloat for creating an atmosphere of
driftlessness.
	   ``The Prime Minister is busy with another trick, another
maneuver, with one purpose, not for the economy, not peace, but
only to survive,'' Labor party frontbencher Haim Ramon said. ``He
has no time for the real problems.

<TEXT>
	   HOLLYWOOD, Florida (AP) _ Joe DiMaggio suffered a serious
setback over the weekend in his recovery from lung cancer surgery,
his doctor said Monday.
	   ``Joe has had a significant and serious turn for the worse,''
Dr. Earl Barron told The Associated Press. ``The outlook has dimmed
over the past 72 hours. He's not in good shape.''
	   Barron said DiMaggio's lung infection had returned and that he
had developed a fever.
	   ``He is being treated with antibiotics and his blood pressure is
being maintained with medications,'' the doctor said.
	   DiMaggio, a Hall of Fame baseball player, remains in intensive
care where he has been for much of the time since entering the
hospital on Oct. 12. He underwent surgery to have a malignant tumor
removed from his right lung two days later.
	   ``I saw him this morning,'' Barron said. ``We are continuing
supportive care. The outlook is not as good as it was a few days
ago.''

<TEXT>
	   GENOA, Italy (AP) _ Police in the wee hours of Monday stopped a
Mercedes driven by Argentine soccer star Ariel Ortega and cited him
for drunk driving and Sampdoria of Genoa teammate Fernando Cordoba
for drunkenness, officers said.
	   Police officer Sebastiano Salvo said Ortega's car and driver's
license were taken away. A judge will later decide for how long,
but licenses can be suspended in Italy for drunken driving for up
to six months.
	   Cordoba, also Argentine, was cited for drunkenness and making
threats for allegedly telling police that they would get in trouble
for stopping them.
	   No action was taken against a third player in the car, Brazilian
Cate. All three players were taken to a police station for
alcohol-level tests.
	   Police stopped the car at 4:30 a.m. after someone complained
that people near a Mercedes parked in a downtown square were
exchanging insults and having a loud discussion.
	   Ortega, who leads Sampdoria with three goals this season, joined
the Serie A club after the World Cup.

Child-porn defendant confesses to some charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A Dane on trial for distributing
child pornography through the Internet for an international ring
admitted Monday that he had made pornographic videos with his
daughter and had distributed some photos.
	   But he denied some of the other charges, including that of
raping his daughter.
	   The 41-year-old defendant, who cannot be named under a court
order, was arrested in November 1997 in what police then said was
the biggest child pornography case ever investigated in Denmark.
	   A tip from Belgian police, who were investigating a pedophile
scandal, led Danish police to the man believed to be at the center
of the ring with ties to 19 countries, including the United States,
Canada, France, Germany and Italy. The man used the name
``Goldilocks'' on Internet.
	   Danish police said they found 20,000 pornographic photos of
children stored on the defendant's computer, as well as videotapes
of him sexually abusing his 6-year-old daughter.
	   During the opening of the trial, the defendant burst out into
tears when the 12-man jury screened some of the videotapes,
according to Denmark's TV2.
	   If convicted, he could face six months in prison for
distributing the material, and up to 10 years in jail for having
sex with a child.
	   Possession of pornography involving those under 15 is only
punishable with fines in Denmark.

Kyrgyzstan declares moratorium on death sentence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ About 50 death row inmates in Kyrgyzstan may avoid
execution because of a moratorium on the death penalty declared by
President Askar Akayev, his spokesman said Monday.
	   Akayev's decree made the central Asian nation the latest of
several former Soviet republics to suspend the death penalty.
	   No executions will take place in the next two years,
presidential spokesman Kanybek Imanaliyev said.
	   Akayev timed the decree to mark the 50th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Imanaliyev said, according
to the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies. The declaration was
adopted by the United Nations on Dec. 10, 1948.
	   Akayev also ordered his government to make sure that every
prison in Kyrgyzstan has a psychologist on staff, Imanaliyev said.
	   Separately, Akayev also charged Monday that senior government
officials had ties with organized crime, which is putting ``open
pressure'' on the Kyrgyz economy, Interfax reported. He named no
names.
	   Russia also declared a moratorium on the death penalty in 1996,
but its efforts to formally outlaw it have been stymied by the
opposition-dominated parliament. Ukraine, Azerbaijan and
Turkmenistan also have suspended it.

Report Britain to set up compensation fund for Holocaust victims

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government will establish a 25 million pound
(dlrs 40 million) fund to compensate Nazis' victims whose assets
were seized by Britain during World War II, The Financial Times
said Monday.
	   The newspaper reported that Trade and Industry Secretary Peter
Mandelson will announce the fund's creation in a speech at a dinner
given Monday by the British-Israel Chamber of Commerce.
	   A spokesman for the minister, speaking on customary terms of
anonymity, said only that Mandelson would give details of the
compensation plan on Tuesday in Parliament. The spokesman would not
comment further.
	   Rabbi Jonathan Romain, a spokesman for the Reform Synagogues of
Great Britain, welcomed the fund's creation, saying it was a
``long-overdue rectification of a 55-year-old injustice.''
	   Property from Nazis' victims was seized under Britain's 1939
Trading with the Enemy Act, which was intended to stop
``belligerent countries'' using property belonging to their
nationals to finance Hitler's war effort.
	   However, innocent victims, including many Jews who had sent cash
and valuables to Britain for safekeeping, were also affected by the
act and have not yet received compensation.
	   The newspaper said the plan would involve mainly people from
Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and the Czech republic, whose property
was seized by Britain because their countries were held to be
allied with Nazi Germany.

Russian ruble plunges further, World Bank team arrives for talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, UPDATES with figures on debts, money printed,
other details. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The arrival of a World Bank team Monday for more
loan talks did little to assuage fears that Russia will be left
without foreign aid, and the ruble resumed its slide toward a new
low.
	   The ruble rate has been the main indicator of economic
confidence since Russian financial markets were virtually wiped out
in August, and its fall reflected fears that Russia will begin
printing large sums of money to pay off its debts and cover the
budget deficit.
	   Substantial money-printing is certain to trigger high inflation.
	   Russia printed 3.5 billion rubles (dlrs 172 million) in October,
and 10 billion rubles (dlrs 490 million) in November to cover the
deficit, Central Bank deputy head Tatyana Paramonova said Monday,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   But the government has warned it would have to print much more
if no foreign aid arrives, and traders said Monday the Central Bank
may already have printed more money than it is willing to admit.
	   Russia's foreign debt will total dlrs 143.9 billion on Jan 1,
Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Monday, according to
Interfax.
	   Of this, dlrs 17.5 billion in servicing costs is due next year,
but Russia says it doesn't have the money and needs to reschedule
some of the debt. A government delegation will leave Dec. 9 for
rescheduling talks with the Paris Club of creditor nations, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported Monday.
	   Russia had hoped to cover the debt payments by dipping into the
dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package that the International Monetary
Fund put together in July. But the loan was frozen after Russia's
financial weaknesses and the global economic crisis prompted the
government to devalue the ruble and default on some debts in
August.
	   The World Bank team that arrived Monday was to reconsider the
terms of several loans promised in the IMF-led loan package,
including dlrs 1.5 billion for structural reform and dlrs 800
million to streamline the ailing coal industry, Interfax reported.
	   The team will make recommendations to the World Bank board of
directors later this month, when it discusses its plans for Russia.
	   However, until the IMF acts, other foreign lenders are unlikely
to give Russia money.
	   And the IMF is urging Russia to provide a realistic budget for
next year as a key condition for resuming loans, and is showing no
sign that it will free the money any time soon.
	   Meanwhile, the ruble plunged in Monday trading, and hit 20.4 to
the dollar in the official Central Bank rate _ down 0.8 rubles from
Friday.
	   The ruble sold for more than 20 to the dollar shortly after the
crisis hit in August before making a mild comeback. The ruble was
at about 6 to the dollar before the crisis.
	   Traders said that the ruble's slide on Monday was slowed by
interference from the Central Bank _ which spends its hard-currency
reserves to buy rubles, thus increasing the demand and driving the
ruble rate back up.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Dozens of Ukrainian opposition party
activists and lawmakers demonstrated Monday near the Swiss Embassy
in Kiev to protest the arrest of their leader in Switzerland on
money-laundering charges.
	   The protesters, from the centrist Hromada movement, held
placards that read: ``Hands off the leader of Hromada!'' and
``Switzerland, stop playing political games!''
	   Hromada chief and former Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko, 45, who
is now a lawmaker in the Ukrainian parliament, was detained last
Wednesday as he drove from France into Switzerland. Swiss
authorities charged him in a money-laundering scheme on Friday.
	   According to investigating Judge Laurent Kasper-Ansermet, a
``relatively large'' sum of money had been seized in Geneva in
connection with the charges against Lazarenko.
	   Last month, Swiss federal police announced that Switzerland was
helping Ukrainian authorities track down money Lazarenko allegedly
stashed in Swiss banks. Switzerland has handed over some bank
documents to Ukraine, and investigations are underway in several
Swiss states.
	   Ukrainian authorities are already investigating whether
Lazarenko and other Hromada leaders have been involved in
corruption.
	   Lazarenko was prime minister from 1996 to 1997, and was
dismissed by President Leonid Kuchma. Critics say Lazarenko reaped
huge profits from the distribution of natural gas supplies in the
former Soviet republic when he served as prime minister, but he and
his allies deny the charges.
	   Lazarenko says the authorities want to discredit him before
presidential elections in October 1999, and he has even accused
Kuchma's close entourage of plotting to kill him.
	   Lazarenko's party fared well in parliamentary elections this
year and he was widely considered a top contender in the future
presidential race. His arrest appears to deal his chances a severe
blow.
	   Several Hromada legislators from among Monday's protesters met
with the Swiss ambassador, presenting the embassy with a letter
that said Lazarenko's arrest was a ``planned action of reprisal
against a politician whose party is in the opposition,'' the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Lazarenko's initial term of arrest is eight days. A hearing is
expected this week and Kasper-Ansermet, the judge, has said he
would ask to detain the Ukrainian politician until trial.
	   Kasper-Ansermet arrived in Ukraine on Monday evening accompanied
by Swiss investigators who plan to collect evidence in Lazarenko's
case, Interfax said.

Official: Russian December tax revenues to reach 11 billion rubles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's cash-poor government hopes to collect at
least 11 billion rubles (dlrs 539 million) in taxes in December, an
official said Monday.
	   Sergei Shulgin, deputy head of the Federal Tax Service, said the
tax collection data for November hasn't been calculated yet, but he
expects the number to be ``around the same levels as October.''
	   The tax service collected 13.8 billion rubles (dlrs 863 million
at the time) in October.
	   Problems with tax collection have plagued Russia for years and
now that the country is mired in its worst economic crisis since
the 1991 Soviet collapse, the government is particularly eager to
boost tax revenues.
	   Shulgin also said tax collections for the first 10 months of
this year were 36 percent above target _ but he didn't indicate
whether that was based on tax goals set before or after the Aug. 17
devaluation of the ruble. The ruble has lost nearly 70 percent of
its value since then, but tax collection targets have been
frequently adjusted since then.
	   The government recently approved a plan for overhauling Russia's
tax system, including a reduction of the profit tax from 35 percent
to 30 percent, and an introduction of a sale tax.
	   ``We need to free up companies' profits so they can invest in
their production facilities,'' Shulgin told a news conference
Monday.
	   The government also wants to reduce the value-added tax from 20
percent to 15 percent in 1999 and to 10 percent in 2000.
	   The tax service has estimated that the reduction of the VAT will
result in a loss of 20 billion rubles (dlrs 980 million) in budget
revenues next year, but the combined effect of the tax reform would
be a 40 billion-ruble increase in the gross domestic product, to
100 billion rubles in 1999, Shulgin said.
	   However, uncertainty over the likely size of Russia's economy
next year makes any judgments about the effects of tax cuts on the
GDP unreliable.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Her male colleagues read newspapers when
she first spoke at government meetings, so Industry Minister
Henryka Bochniarz decided she'd have to seize their attention.
	   She sharply criticized another Cabinet minister's talk, and the
men put their papers down, Bochniarz, now a business consultant and
president of the Polish Business Council, recalls with a smile.
	   With her short blonde hair, tailored pants suit and no-nonsense
gaze, Bochniarz represents a new breed of woman emerging in Poland
after decades of isolated communist rule.
	   Old customs and perceptions persist _ men still open doors for
women and kiss their hands _ but exposure to Western social
developments is beginning to challenge stereotypes in the home and
workplace.
	   ``It is not just about professionalism,'' Bochniarz says. ``It's
about state of mind.''
	   Today's Polish woman faces choices unheard of just 10 years ago,
when traditional roles of the pre-communist era _ the good mother
and strong woman behind her working, freedom-fighting man _ had
been skewed by communist principles of an inclusive working class.
	   Women worked alongside men in state-owned factories. Then they
returned home to the traditional jobs of fixing dinner, bathing the
kids and cleaning the house.
	   Now, more Polish women marry later, have fewer children, spend
most of their time away from home and generally assert their
independence.
	   ``There is no way back,'' says Krystyna Kofta, who meets with
women all over Poland to write articles for Twoj Styl (Your Style),
Poland's leading women's magazine. ``They want to break free. I can
see it. Even if mothers cannot do it now, their daughters will.''
	   Open borders since 1989 have given Poles a clear view West,
where they see women juggling family and career. And sweeping
reforms toward a market economy have meant shifting industries with
new opportunities.
	   Beata Stelmach began her career in 1991 when the Warsaw Stock
Exchange was created.
	   ``There were not many specialists. We all started from the same
level. Everybody was evaluated on merit. It was a chance for
everybody,'' says Stelmach, now spokeswoman for the government's
Securities and Exchange Commission.
	   The new conditions didn't bring automatic change for women, says
Anna Achmatowicz, deputy editor in chief of Twoj Styl, which
started in 1990.
	   ``We had to make them realize their rights, that they don't have
to accept anything,'' she says.
	   The magazine's early stories explained ``everything from A to
Z,'' such as how to do self-examinations for breast cancer and how
to use the Internet, Achmatowicz says.
	   Advice also is coming from a growing array of international
women's magazines like Cosmopolitan, Marie Claire and She, which
have started Polish-language editions.
	   ``We scream to them: You are great and you can do anything you
want,'' says Grazyna Olbrych, editor in chief of the Polish edition
of Cosmopolitan, which has been on the market since early 1997.
	   Not everyone likes the changes.
	   The Solidarity-led government, with strong links to the Roman
Catholic Church, wants to preserve the traditional model of large
families with women caring for the home and children.
	   Parliament is dithering over a proposed law on equal status of
sexes, which would allow women to sue employers for gender
discrimination. Women account for 61 percent of Poland's almost 1.7
million jobless adults.
	   The government also has resisted sex education programs for
teen-agers, and it cut subsidies for contraception pills that made
them cheaper. Instead, Family Issues Minister Kazimierz Kapera
proposed subsidizing Viagra ``to boost births in our homeland.''
	   A government report on families released in July condemned
modern women's magazines for promoting the ``model of individual
career instead of family culture which ... frustrates deeply Polish
women.''
	   Olbrych, the Cosmopolitan editor, responds: ``The main complaint
against us is: You tell women they should decide about
themselves.''
	   Some women have done just that. Since 1989, births have dropped
38 percent among urban women aged 20-24, while the marriage rate in
cities is down 22 percent, according to the government family
report.
	   The gap between men's and women's pay has narrowed from 35
percent in 1981-82 to 25 percent in the mid-1990s, says Henryk
Domanski, a professor at the Polish Academy of Sciences who has
studied the issue since 1992.
	   Leszek Wrobel, head of the Accord hiring agency in Warsaw, says
more women are seeking work.
	   ``They are better prepared each year. They look more
professional and know how to sell themselves,'' Wrobel says.
``Media show successful women who are well off and independent.
They have examples to follow.''
	   But stereotypes persist. The most popular television soap opera,
``Klan,'' portrays women in common roles _ the betrayed wife,
anguished mother searching for her son, inexperienced girl seduced
by a married man.
	   Kasia Uszak, a law school graduate who moved to Warsaw from
Szczecin to work for an investment firm last January, earns five
times what she did in Szczecin. But her new status makes little
impression back home.
	   ``Acquaintances say that I am already an old maid and that I aim
too high,'' she says. ``They say I should devote myself to husband
and kids, or at least to getting those.''

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian police opened fire Monday on
rioters protesting Israel's refusal to release Palestinian
prisoners _ the first sign that the Palestinian police were
containing violence in advance of President Bill Clinton's visit
next week.
	   Protests on the prisoner issue swept through the West Bank, both
in Israeli-controlled and Palestinian-controlled areas. A settler
opened fire on rioters on a major road to Jerusalem, and two youths
were injured _ one critically.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who hailed Clinton's upcoming
trip as ``historical and great,'' is anxious to show that the
Palestinians are meeting the conditions of the U.S.-brokered accord
reached at Wye River in Maryland in October.
	   In Palestinian-controlled Nablus, loyalists of Fatah _ a
movement started by Arafat _ surrounded the police station and
began lobbing stones and fire bombs inside. They torched police
vehicles and tried to storm the gates of the prison.
	   Police opened fire on the protesters, injuring at least seven,
according to hospital sources.
	   The Fatah protest had been prompted by the methods club-wielding
riot police had used earlier in the day against mothers of
prisoners who were demonstrating to press Arafat to pressure Israel
to release prisoners.
	   Clinton will visit Gaza _ the first sitting U.S. President to do
so _ and open a meeting of the Palestinian National Council.
Palestinians and Israelis alike see the visit as tacit endorsement
of Palestinian hopes of statehood.
	   The Palestinians exhibited confiscated weapons to CIA officials
on Monday in an effort to prove that they are meeting Wye's
security commitments.
	   Netanyahu, who has accused the Palestinian Authority of
stage-managing the riots, was not enthusiastic about the Clinton
visit.
	   ``I hope Mr. Clinton uses his visit to demand Palestinian
compliance,'' he told Israel television.
	   Israel was already balking at withdrawal plans worked out at
Wye.
	   ``We have to find out whether (the Palestinians) are living up
to their committments,'' said top Netanyahu adviser David
Bar-Illan. ``So far the conclusion is that it will be very
difficult to implement the next withdrawal on time.''
	   The Palestinian Authority _ which denies accusations that it
backs the rioters _ has accused Netanyahu of fanning the flames by
reneging on a prisoner release commitment achieved at Wye.
	   Israel released 250 prisoners last month, but most were common
criminals, instead of the security prisoners the Palestinians had
hoped through. Netanyahu insists that he will not release the
security prisoners, whom he describes as murderers.
	   The prisoners have gone on a hunger strike that they say
encompasses all 3,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails. The Israel
Prisons Service knows of only 514 strikers.
	   There were at least five riots in the West Bank Monday.
Palestinian students _ some toting their homework in schoolbags _
ambushed cars with stones on the road between the Maaleh Adumim
settlement and Jerusalem.
	   Settler David Adawi opened fire from a van. Two students were
injured, one critically _ Nasr Erekat, 20, a first cousin of top
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   It was a repeat of a situation last week when a soldier fended
off blows after stone-throwing Palestinians managed to disable the
car he was in near Ramallah. But in that case, Cpl. Assaf Meyara
did not use his gun, and instead ran away.
	   His actions _ filmed and photographed _ were excoriated by many,
including Netanyahu.
	   ``If a soldier or civilian is caught in a life-threatening
situation, it is his right and even his obligation to save himself
in accordance with the law,'' he said.
	   The fact that both Meyara and Adawi are now both under police
investigation and may face charges for taking opposite tacks when
under attack could fuel the increasing perception that the peace
process is adrift.
	   Both major television news progrms drew comparisons between the
incidents, both caught on video.
	   ``Suddenly 100 to 200 Arabs with big stones surrounded us around
the car,'' said Adawi's driver, who would only give his name as
Michael, told Associated Press Television. ``They want to kill
us.''
	   The mixed signals over how to behave when under attack reflects
a wider confusion over the peace process. The accord between the
Israelis and Palestinians after the Wye talks quickly deteriorated
into mutual recriminations.
	   Israel's opposition _ which sought support for an early
elections bill in the parliament on Monday _ blamed Netanyahu's
struggle to keep his coalition afloat for creating an atmosphere of
driftlessness.
	   ``The Prime Minister is busy with another trick, another
maneuver, with one purpose, not for the economy, not peace, but
only to survive,'' Labor party frontbencher Haim Ramon said. ``He
has no time for the real problems.

Le Pen loyalist rebels as National Front rivalry bursts into open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with party member rebelling, background.
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In the clearest sign yet that Jean-Marie Le Pen may
be losing his grip on the party he's led for a quarter-century, one
of his loyalists defied him Monday, calling for an urgent national
meeting to prevent the party's ``explosion.''
	   For months, the rivalry between the flamboyant Le Pen and his
quieter, more pragmatic lieutenant, Bruno Megret, has been
simmering.
	   But after a tempestuous weekend during which Le Pen implicitly
described Megret's backers as ``extremists and racists,'' the
tensions seemed to have reached their boiling point.
	   On Monday afternoon, Serge Martinez, the National Front's head
of personnel and a member of its 43-member political bureau,
summoned reporters to a Paris hotel and said: ``The unity of our
movement is gravely threatened.''
	   Without taking Megret's side, the longtime Le Pen loyalist said
Le Pen had begun acting with an ``anything-but-Megret'' attitude.
	   The worst moment, Martinez said, came last week when as
personnel director he was forced to fire two Megret loyalists.
	   Jean-Marie Le Pen ``can no longer count on me for that kind of
task,'' Martinez said, meaning he wouldn't follow any Le Pen orders
he disagreed with.
	   Martinez called for an urgent, extraordinary meeting of the
party's 50,000 or so members nationwide. He refused to say whether
that meant calling Le Pen's leadership into question _ although
that was the clear implication.
	   ``We must protect the National Front from the explosion that
threatens it,'' he said.
	   The National Front is virulently anti-immigrant, and has been
widely accused of racism and anti-Semitism.
	   For 27 years, Le Pen has been the movement's absolute leader.
But his recent, increasingly public clashes with Megret, long
perceived as his successor, have deeply divided the party.
	   First the two clashed over Megret's strategy of making alliances
with the traditional right in regional elections.
	   Then, they clashed more publicly this summer, when Le Pen,
threatened with a legal ban on running for office, proposed that
his wife _ not Megret _ replace him at the top of the party list
for upcoming European Parliament elections.
	   Ultimately, the issue was moot because Le Pen, having appealed
the court ruling, will be eligible for the 1999 campaign. But the
episode showed the deepening animosity between the two men.
	   On Saturday, at a noisy party meeting, Le Pen ejected two of
Megret's backers: Hubert Fayard and Nathalie Debaille, the same two
who had been fired a few days earlier.
	   On television Sunday night, Le Pen blamed the problems on ``a
few people from an extremist and even racist minority.''
	   If Megret ``thinks my position represents a sort of betrayal,''
Le Pen continued, ``I think he has no business in the movement I
preside over.''
	   Le Pen faces trouble even outside France. Last month, the
European Parliament voted to lift his parliamentary immunity so
German prosecutors can investigate whether he broke laws that make
trivializing the Holocaust a crime.

Father and son reunited during U.S. Marine maneuvers in Israel

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After nearly two decades of separation, an
Israeli father was reunited and his son, a U.S. Marine on military
maneuvers in Israel's southern Negev Desert.
	   The father, Dr. David Ben-Menachem said Monday the two were
separated when his estranged wife Jennifer left Israel with their
son Yossi and two daughters to Jamaica and eventually Florida
shortly after his son's birth, almost twenty years ago.
	   Ben-Menachem said that his efforts to remain in contact with his
children were rebuffed by his former wife's family and he had since
given up hope of any reunion.
	   Israeli journalists at the training exercises noticed the
19-year-old Marine speaking in Hebrew and when they approached him,
Levitt said that he wanted to meet his father who he had last seen
as a young boy.
	   The Yediot Ahronot newspaper printed Levitt's photo Friday and
the two were reunited at Levitt's training base Sunday.
	   ``We talked about the past and will keep in contact in the
future and try not to loose touch again,'' Levitt told Channel Two.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz said Levitt would be given
special leave at the end of the maneuvers to spend time with his
father.
	   Schwartz said that the training exercises were routine under
U.S.-Israel security agreements, adding that Israel was one of the
few countries in the region that allowed U.S. Marines to train on
its soil.
	   Schwartz said that the Marines were conducting the exercises
alone and that the fleet would return to sea before U.S. President
Bill Clinton's visit to the region Saturday.

Gulf leaders to focus on oil at annual summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES for AMs with speeches by Annan, Mandela, falling oil
prices. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Six Arab Gulf leaders
opened an annual summit Monday that was expected to focus on
falling oil prices, which have hit their economies hard.
	   Shortly before the meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council
began, January futures contracts for Brent crude _ a widely watched
benchmark _ fell to a record low of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on the
International Petroleum Exchange in London.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent.
	   The Gulf oil producers, who control about half of global oil
reserves, have been hard hit by the oil market crisis, which has
been blamed on the recession in Asia and warmer-than-usual winters.
Oil exports account for some 75 percent of their revenues.
	   For the first time, the GCC summit is being attended by leaders
outside the group, including U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
South African President Nelson Mandela.
	   Both told the opening session of the three-day summit that they
hoped the Wye River agreement, brokered by U.S. President Bill
Clinton between Israel and the Palestinians, would lead to peace in
the Middle East.
	   Annan made no mention of his talks with Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi, whom he met Saturday in a desert tent in Jerba, Libya, to
try and arrange the trial of two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing
of a Pan Am jet. The bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, killed 270
people.
	   Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for failing to
surrender the men. The United States and Britain have proposed
holding a trial with Scottish judges in the Netherlands _ and idea
Annan is trying to get Gadhafi to accept.
	   ``We are well on the way to resolving the problem,'' Annan told
U.S. Secretary Madeleine Albright by telephone on Sunday, according
to a U.N. statement.
	   The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and
the United Arab Emirates in a federation aimed at economic and
defense cooperation.
	   The summit host, the United Arab Emirates, said Sunday that
trying to stabilize oil prices, which are hovering at 12-year lows
of between dlrs 10 and dlrs 11, will be the main topic of
discussion at the GCC.
	   Diplomatic sources in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, said that the
kingdom intended to propose a GCC cartel to try to shore up prices.
	   In his speech, Annan said he was ``saddened and burdened'' by
Iraq's repeated confrontations with U.N. weapons inspectors, which
have raised tensions in the region.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before punishing U.N. trade sanctions, imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, can be lifted.
	   ``We all want to move toward the lifting of sanctions one day so
that Iraq can regain its rightful place among the community of
nations,'' Annan said. This, he said, requires Iraq ``to comply
with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.''
	   According to Emirates officials and Western diplomats, who
insisted on anonymity, the summit was also to discuss American and
British efforts to overthrow Saddam Hussein and the U.S. plan to
set up a ``shield'' of missile batteries in the region.
	   Annan also appealed in his speech to both Israel and the
Palestinians to work toward peace. He said violence should not
derail their efforts.
	   ``The recent signing of the Wye River memorandum by Israel and
the Palestine Liberation Organization, coming as it did after many
months of uncertainly and concern over the future of the peace
process, is an encouraging development,'' Annan said. ``We
earnestly hope that this agreement will be implemented in all its
aspects and will pave the way for the resumption of negotiations on
all tracks.''
	   Mandela told the GCC leaders: ``After the revival of hope that
these (Wye River) negotiations brought, it would be nothing short
of tragic if failure to abide by agreements _ including the release
of political prisoners _ again frustrated the aspirations of the
Palestinian people for justice and the yearning of the whole region
and the world for peace in the Middle East.''
	   As a show of force ahead of the summit, Iran's navy and its
elite Revolutionary Guards began five days of naval maneuvers on
Friday in the Gulf. Some 50,000 men and dozens of warships are
taking part.
	   On Monday, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported
that the exercises were test a new missile guidance system
code-named Mersad.

Kosovo Albanian negotiator: U.S. plan totally unacceptable
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to INCORPORATE US reaction &QL; 
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Efforts to forge a political
solution for Kosovo appeared stalemated Monday after the chief
ethnic Albanian negotiator rejected the latest American plan for
the troubled province.
	   Fehmi Agani said the new U.S. draft for a political settlement
in the majority Albanian province was too close to the views of
Serbia. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   Most ethnic Albanians, however, want independence or substantial
self-rule.
	   Speaking to reporters in the provincial capital Pristina, Agani
blasted the American draft as ``unacceptable'' and said it could
not be ``considered a basis for ... future negotiations.''
	   The United States is leading diplomatic efforts to hammer out a
solution which would be acceptable both to independence-seeking
ethnic Albanians and to the Serbian regime which wants to keep
control over Kosovo.
	   In Washington, a White House spokesman, David Leavy, said the
Clinton Administration would keep working on a formula to assure
peace and stability in Kosovo and a return to the kind of autonomy
the province had until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
canceled it a decade ago.
	   ``We are determined to push for a political settlement that will
bring autonomy to Kosovo,'' Leavy told a reporter.
	   But that formula may no longer satisfy ethnic Albanian
politicians. Hundreds have been killed and almost 300,000 ethnic
Albanians displaced in a seven-month crackdown by Serbian forces
against Kosovo's separatists, before an October peace agreement
brought about a tentative truce.
	   American envoy Christopher Hill, shuttling between Belgrade and
Kosovo, has so far presented four versions of a U.S. formula for
the future of the province.
	   ``The new (American) draft is ... almost identical to the
Serbian'' plan, Agani told reporters.
	   Serbia last month released its own proposal for Kosovo under
which the province would be given a degree of autonomy but would
remain firmly under Serbian control.
	   According to Agani, the latest American version accepted the
major Serb demand to have Kosovo remain within Yugoslavia as part
of Serbia and substantially within Serbia's legal system.
	   The previous U.S. draft left out a detailed formula for the
province's final status but ``envisaged... independent institutions
in Kosovo,'' Agani said. He said the earlier draft ``although far
from (ethnic Albanian) demands,'' had ``opened up perspective.''
	   He added the latest changes in the American draft were
``incomprehensible'' and said the ethnic Albanian team would soon
come up with its own proposal for Kosovo.
	   The changes to which the ethnic Albanian side objected most
revolved around Kosovo's future parliament which, according to the
latest American draft, would not be able to pass laws.
	   Also, the draft did not foresee Kosovo as having a separate
government.
	   This latest version of Hill's plan has not been studied by the
Serbian government, Ivan Sedlak, an official in the Serbian team
for Kosovo talks, said.
	   Sedlak said the previous U.S. version was unacceptable because
it defined Kosovo virtually as a separate state but did not comment
on the reworked draft.
	   Although a de-facto cease fire generated by the October

Homosexuality stirs margins of World Council of Churches assembly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD N. OSTLING &QC; 
 &UR; AP Religion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The issues of homosexual liberation and
abortion hovered at the margins of the World Council of Churches
assembly Monday.
	   Both issues could complicate an already worsening split in the
WCC between the Orthodox churches and the Western liberal wing of
Protestantism. The two camps are diametrically opposed on these
matters, and thus the WCC has refused to take a position.
	   But during the assembly, the WCC was staging a weeklong
``padare'' _ the term for ``meeting place'' in Zimbabwe's Shona
language _ in which church-related groups were offering hundreds of
workshops. And eleven of the presentations, including three on
Monday's opening day, were promoting liberal views on
homosexuality.
	   No workshop was advocating the traditional Christian teaching
against same-sex practices.
	   Homosexual activists and their heterosexual supporters want the
WCC assembly to authorize a seven-year study of human sexuality.
There could be lively debate if such a proposal reaches the
assembly floor.
	   That topic seemed irrelevant for African and Asian speakers, who
made fervent appeals during the women's discussion concerning the
debt burden of developing nations and discrimination against the
Dalit (``untouchables'') and Christians of India.
	   The gay and lesbian issue had threatened to divide a
pre-assembly WCC women's festival. Lesbians at the festival clashed
with Orthodox women including Despina Prassas of America's Greek
Orthodox Archdiocese, a doctoral student in theology.
	   A statement from the women's festival that was presented to the
WCC assembly Monday stated that ``human sexuality in all of its
diversity emerged with particular significance'' during a decade of
WCC emphasis on women's issues. But due to Prassas and the other
Orthodox, the statement added that there was ``divided opinion''
and that ``for some women and men in our midst the issue has no
legitimacy.''
	   The Orthodox women accepted that compromise wording, but were
upset when the women's statement said churches should call for laws
to protect women's rights, including ``reproductive rights.'' The
Orthodox considered that to be a code for the right to choose
abortion.
	   A WCC spokeswoman said it could be read that way, or as a
reference to contraception.
	   A protest on behalf of the Orthodox women was written by Prassas
and Anne Glynn Mackoul of the U.S. Antiochian archdiocese, a
lawyer. Mackoul read the protest from the floor, declaring that
Orthodox women did not want the assembly to think that they
affirmed the letter or that it reflected true consensus.
	   She complained that the ``development of theological positions
stemming from contemporary political issues is foreign to the
Orthodox ethos.''
	   The first three WCC workshops on gay and lesbian issues were
sponsored by the Metropolitan Community Churches, a U.S.
denomination for homosexuals with headquarters in Los Angeles;
Urban-Rural Mission (USA), a social justice group based in Durham,
North Carolina; and the International Global Lesbian Network of
Geinhausen, Germany.
	   Other events later in the week are under the auspices of the
Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, the European Forum of Lesbian
and Gay Christian Groups, Germany's Lesbians and the Church, and
the United Church of Canada. The assembly concludes on Dec. 14.
	   Among the speakers at the lesbian network presentation was the
Rev. Elisabeth Wolf of Frankfurt, Germany, who was ordained by a
regional unit of the Evangelical Church in Germany although she's
an avowed lesbian. Wolf said she came out as a lesbian while
studying on a WCC scholarship at New York's Union Theological
Seminary.
	   The day's other developments included a second harsh assembly
intervention from the Russian Orthodox delegation. Father Vsevolod
Chaplin said Western Christians had moved away from the Orthodox by
promoting ordination of women and inclusive language in worship,
``which I personally regard as blasphemy.''
	   He said ``radical feminism is humanism and alien to true
Christianity. It should not be a common agenda for us.''

Railroad chief says strike makes company, clients suffer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with background, CORRECTS spelling of roles in 2nd
graf, strike to affect at least 13 regions on Tuesday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The head of France's state-run railroad, hobbled by
strikes for an eleventh day, issued a call Monday to employees to
end the walkout because it hurts both clients and the company.
	   Louis Gallois, speaking at a news conference, said the 1999
budget of the SNCF foresees stable employee rolls for the first
time in 17 years. Until now, the number of workers has fallen
annually.
	   Gallois said he was not yet in a position to provide personnel
figures, but said that in 1999 there will be for the first time in
17 years ``stability in the number of personnel.''
	   Striking conductors want an additional 600 employees.
	   ``Conductors are demanding more personnel. We have indicated
that in 1999 conductors' jobs will very likely be on the increase
compared to 1998,'' Gallois said, referring to a decision made last
week. No figures have been announced.
	   ``It is time to bring an end to this issue, because the SNCF and
its clients ``are suffering,'' Gallois said.
	   Gallois added that the SNCF foresees a balanced budget in 1999,
after a 1998 deficit likely to exceed the expected 500 million
francs (about dlrs 89 million). The exact figure was not expected
for two months.
	   The Sunday newspaper, Le Journal du Dimanche, reported that the
strike will help inflate 1998 losses to an estimated 700 million
francs (dlrs 125 million).
	   The strike was in effect Monday in 17 out of 23 regions, sparing
the Eurostar to London, the Paris-Brussels route and most trains in
the Paris region.
	   The issue of job strength was likely to be at the center of a
round table discussion Monday and Tuesday between railroad unions
and officials. The strike, however, is not formally entered into
the agenda of the previously planned ``conference on the
conductors' profession.''
	   Traffic was expected to be disrupted in at least 13 regions
Tuesday.

Fatchett discusses Mideast peace, Iraq

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A British minister on Monday discussed the
Middle East peace process and the situation in neighboring Iraq
with Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul-Illah Khatib.
	   Derek Fatchett, a minister of state at Britain's Foreign and
Commonwealth Office, went into talks with Khatib shortly after
arriving in Amman on a tour that will also take him to Syria.
	   A British Embassy statement said the discussions ``are expected
to focus on the latest developments in the Middle East peace
process and the situation in Iraq.'' There was no official
Jordanian comment.
	   The statement said Fatchett will meet Tuesday with Crown Prince
Hassan, who is acting as regent while King Hussein is undergoing
cancer treatment in the United States, and Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawneh.
	   Jordan advocates a swift end to U.N. sanctions imposed on
Baghdad following its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The
government says the sanctions are seriously hurting the Iraqi
people.
	   The government also has called for a dialogue between Iraq and
the United States, saying this could forge better understanding and
avert frequent tension between them.
	   Britain, however, advocates a tougher line with Iraq. It says
Baghdad must abide by U.N. resolutions and eliminate its weapons of
mass destruction before the embargo can be lifted.
	   Britain has often sided with the United States in threatening
military action to force Iraq to cooperate with U.N. weapons
inspectors.

Le Pen loyalist rebels as National Front rivalry bursts into open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Martinez immediately fired; edits to conform,
trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In the latest sign of serious trouble in the
far-right National Front, one of party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen's
loyalists openly defied him on Monday _ and was immediately fired.
	   The events came amid growing evidence that the flamboyant Le
Pen, who has led the National Front for a quarter-century, is
losing his grip on the party to his longtime lieutenant and now
rival, Bruno Megret.
	   Moments after the end of a news conference called by a longtime
Le Pen loyalist, Serge Martinez, harshly criticizing recent actions
by Le Pen, the party leader issued a terse statement:
	   Serge Martinez is ``removed from all his political and
administrative functions with the National Front,'' it said.
	   In his unusual news conference at a Paris hotel, Martinez, the
Front's head of personnel and a member of its 43-member political
bureau, announced: ``The unity of our movement is gravely
threatened.''
	   Without taking Megret's side, the longtime Le Pen loyalist said
Le Pen had begun acting with an ``anything-but-Megret'' attitude.
	   He called for an urgent congress of all the party's 50,000 or so
members. ``We must protect the National Front from the explosion
that threatens it,'' he said.
	   He refused to say whether that meant calling Le Pen's leadership
into question _ although that was the clear implication.
	   The worst moment, Martinez said Monday, came last week when, as
personnel director, he was forced to fire two Megret loyalists,
ostensibly for economic reasons.
	   Le Pen ``can no longer count on me for that kind of task,''
Martinez said.
	   The National Front is virulently anti-immigrant, and has been
widely accused of racism and anti-Semitism.
	   For 27 years, Le Pen has been the movement's absolute leader.
But his recent, increasingly public clashes with the quieter, more
pragmatic Megret have deeply divided the party.
	   First the two clashed over Megret's strategy of making alliances
with the traditional right in regional elections.
	   Then, they clashed more publicly this summer, when Le Pen,
threatened with a legal ban on running for office, proposed that
his wife _ not Megret _ replace him at the top of the party list
for upcoming European Parliament elections.
	   Ultimately, the issue was moot because Le Pen, having appealed
the court ruling, will be eligible for the 1999 campaign. But the
episode showed a rapidly deepening animosity between the two men.
	   On Saturday, at a noisy party meeting, Le Pen ejected two of
Megret's backers: Hubert Fayard and Nathalie Debaille, the same two
who had been fired a few days earlier.
	   On television Sunday night, he blamed the problems on ``a few
people from an extremist and even racist minority.''
	   If Megret ``thinks my position represents a sort of betrayal,''
Le Pen continued, ``I think he has no business in the movement I
preside over.''

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian police opened fire Monday on
rioters protesting Israel's refusal to release Palestinian
prisoners _ the first sign that the Palestinian police were
containing violence in advance of President Bill Clinton's visit
next week.
	   In the West Bank city of Nablus, Palestinian police took to the
rooftops and fired onto a crowd of some 3,000 Palestinians, mostly
bystanders who had gathered to watch the rioting. Witnesses said at
least five people were wounded and taken away to hospitals.
	   Protests on the prisoner issue swept through the West Bank, both
in Israeli-controlled and Palestinian-controlled areas. A settler
opened fire on rioters on a major road to Jerusalem, and two youths
were injured _ one critically.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who hailed Clinton's upcoming
trip as ``historical and great,'' is anxious to show that the
Palestinians are meeting the conditions of the U.S.-brokered accord
reached at Wye River in Maryland in October.
	   Earlier in Nablus, loyalists of Fatah _ a movement started by
Arafat _ surrounded the police station and began lobbing stones and
fire bombs inside. They torched police vehicles and tried to storm
the gates of the prison.
	   Police opened fire on the protesters, injuring at least seven,
according to hospital sources.
	   The Fatah protest had been prompted by the methods club-wielding
riot police had used during the day against mothers of prisoners
who were demonstrating to press Arafat to pressure Israel to
release prisoners.

Kofi Annan's reaction in new 8th and 9th grafs. Edits throughout.

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The United Nations has evacuated 14
peacekeepers who had been trapped by fighting between the army and
UNITA rebels in central Angola.
	   The U.N. peace monitors _ a Swede, a Brazilian, a Senegalese and
11 Indians _ arrived Monday in Luanda, the capital, aboard a U.N.
aircraft.
	   U.N. spokesman Hamadoun Toure said the men were withdrawn from
the UNITA strongholds of Andulo and Bailundo, southeast of Luanda.
	   ``They are all well. Their morale is high, they are in good
health and good spirits,'' Toure told reporters.
	   The peacekeepers will fly from Luanda to their home countries,
he added.
	   Andulo and Bailundo, where the UNITA leadership is based,
reportedly are under attack by government forces in the latest
fighting to threaten the crumbling 1994 peace accord.
	   The government had accused UNITA of using the peacekeepers as
human shields to ward off attack. In a statement Friday, the U.N.
Security Council said it would hold UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi
personally responsible for the safety of the monitors.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed relief at the
release of the peacekeepers, saying he was encouraged ``that reason
has prevailed.''
	   He also urged the two sides to fully implement the peace accord.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ has yielded control of most of the
land it once held but has refused to relinquish its last
strongholds despite U.N. pressure.
	   Civil war broke out in the vast, southwest African nation
following Angola's 1975 independence from Portugal. At least
500,000 people were killed in the fighting.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A twin-engine plane with at least 11
people aboard crashed Monday in shallow waters of the St. Lawrence
River in Quebec. Three people were rescued, but the others were
feared trapped in the wreckage.
	   A civilian helicopter rescued three of those on board and flew
them to a hospital, a search and rescue official said in Halifax.
	   But Lt. Jason Proulx said there was no sign of the other people
on board, and they were believed trapped inside the fuselage under
water. Asked about the prospects of other survivors, he said,
``It's not looking good, but I'd rather not speculate.''
	   Proulx said the plane was sitting in shallow water, with only
its tail sticking out above the surface.
	   The plane went down near the Quebec town of Baie-Comeau, about
180 miles (300 kilometers) northeast of Quebec City. Authorities
said the plane had been en route from Baie-Comeau to Rimouski,
Quebec.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian police opened fire Monday on
rioters protesting Israel's refusal to release Palestinian
prisoners _ the first sign that the Palestinian police were
containing violence in advance of President Bill Clinton's visit
next week.
	   In the West Bank city of Nablus, Palestinian police took to the
rooftops and fired onto a crowd of some 3,000 Palestinians, mostly
bystanders who had gathered to watch the rioting. Witnesses said at
least five people were wounded and taken away to hospitals.
	   Protests on the prisoner issue swept through the West Bank, both
in Israeli-controlled and Palestinian-controlled areas. A settler
opened fire on rioters on a major road to Jerusalem, and two youths
were injured _ one critically.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who hailed Clinton's upcoming
trip as ``historical and great,'' is anxious to show that the
Palestinians are meeting the conditions of the U.S.-brokered accord
reached at Wye River in Maryland in October.
	   Earlier in Nablus, loyalists of Fatah _ a movement started by
Arafat _ surrounded the police station and began lobbing stones and
fire bombs inside. They torched police vehicles and tried to storm
the gates of the prison.
	   Police opened fire on the protesters, injuring at least seven,
according to hospital sources.
	   The Fatah protest had been prompted by the methods club-wielding

Tribe kidnaps four German tourists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Bedouins on Monday kidnapped four German
tourists, three of them women, according to tribal leaders and
German diplomats.
	   Three gunman of the Bani Dhabyan tribe forced the tourists into
their truck on the main road between San`a and the Dhamar province,
about 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of the capital, the tribesmen
and diplomats said.
	   It was not immediately known where they were taken, they said.
They asked that their names not be used.
	   The Germans apparently were on their way back to San`a after a
trip through central Yemen.
	   The Bani Dhabyan tribe has carried out numerous kidnappings,
including the seizure in April of a British teacher, David
Mitchell, his wife and their 14-year old son.
	   The tribe roams areas around San`a and Marib, which is 170
kilometers (105 miles) northeast of the capital.
	   Armed tribesmen, who control large parts of Yemen, frequently
kidnap foreigners to try to win concessions from the government in
exchange for their release. The hostages are usually well treated
and released unharmed.

Eight dead, about a dozen injured in retirement home fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with mayor's office saying eight not 10 dead in fire &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos PAR102-03

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A pre-dawn fire Monday gutted a retirement home
that just a week ago failed a safety inspection, killing eight
people and injuring about two dozen others, officials said.
	   Three other people died in a second overnight blaze in a Paris
apartment house.
	   Eight people were killed in the retirement-home blaze, according
to the mayor's office in suburban Livry-Gargan where it is located,
which originally said 10 people had died. Two dozen people were
injured, half of them seriously.
	   The head of the rescue service, Commander Jean-Luc Chivot, said
the retirement home failed to pass a Dec. 1 inspection.
	   Among other things, the safety commission found wanting
emergency facilities that would help rescue workers in the event of
a disaster, Chivot said on France-3 television.
	   About 140 firefighters fought the 4 a.m. (0300 GMT) blaze that
officials said began in a ground-floor room and spread up the
elevator shaft over three floors.
	   Chivot estimated that the fire had been burning a half-hour
before rescue workers received an alert.
	   He said some 40 people of the approximately 80 people in the
home, located in the northern working-class area of Seine-Saint
Denis, were evacuated by ladder.
	   ``We were able to get them out fast,'' he said, ``Otherwise, the
death toll would have been higher.''
	   In a northern Paris neighborhood, another fire left three people
dead and 13 hurt, three seriously, firefighters said.
	   That blaze broke out at about 3 a.m. (0200 GMT), and 150
firefighters with 43 trucks took an hour to knock it down, the
officials said on customary anonymity.
	   The fire, in the 9th district near Montmartre, began in a
staircase and spread to the fourth, fifth and sixth floors,
officials said.
	   The cause of both blazes was under investigation.
	   According to the all-news television station LCI, the nursing
home fire may have been started by a short circuit in an electric
bed. The source of that information was not immediately known.
	   The mayor of the town, Alain Calmat, said on LCI that the
nursing home was built in 1965, before new building standards were
set. Work to get the nursing home up to standards was in progress,
he said.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian police opened fire Monday on
rioters protesting Israel's refusal to release Palestinian
prisoners _ the first sign that the Palestinian police were
containing violence in advance of U.S. President Bill Clinton's
visit next week.
	   In the West Bank city of Nablus, Palestinian police took to the
rooftops and fired onto a crowd of some 3,000 Palestinians, mostly
bystanders who had gathered to watch the rioting. Witnesses said at
least five people were wounded and taken away to hospitals.
	   Protests on the prisoner issue swept through the West Bank, both
in Israeli-controlled and Palestinian-controlled areas. A settler
opened fire on rioters on a major road to Jerusalem, and two youths
were injured _ one critically.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who hailed Clinton's upcoming
trip as ``historical and great,'' wants to show that the
Palestinians are meeting the conditions of the U.S.-brokered accord
at the Wye Summit in October.
	   Earlier in Nablus, loyalists of Fatah _ a movement started by
Arafat _ surrounded the police station and began lobbing stones and
fire bombs inside. They torched police vehicles and tried to storm
the gates of the prison.
	   Police opened fire on the protesters, injuring at least seven,
according to hospital sources.
	   The Fatah protest had been prompted by the violence of
club-wielding riot police against mothers of prisoners demanding
that Arafat pressure Israel to release prisoners.
	   Clinton will visit Gaza _ the first sitting U.S. President to do
so _ and open a meeting of the Palestinian National Council.
Palestinians and Israelis alike see the visit as tacit endorsement
of Palestinian hopes of statehood.
	   Netanyahu, who has accused the Palestinian Authority of
stage-managing the riots, was not enthusiastic about the Clinton
visit.
	   ``I hope Mr. Clinton uses his visit to demand Palestinian
compliance,'' he told Israel television.
	   Israel was already balking at withdrawal plans worked out at
Wye.
	   ``We have to find out whether (the Palestinians) are living up
to their committments,'' said top Netanyahu adviser David
Bar-Illan. ``So far the conclusion is that it will be very
difficult to implement the next withdrawal on time.''
	   The Palestinian Authority _ which denies accusations that it
backs the rioters _ has accused Netanyahu of fanning the flames by
reneging on a prisoner release commitment achieved at Wye.
	   Israel released 250 prisoners last month, but most were common
criminals, instead of the security prisoners the Palestinians had
hoped. Netanyahu insists that he will not release the security
prisoners, whom he describes as murderers.
	   The prisoners have gone on a hunger strike that they say
encompasses all 3,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails. The Israel
Prisons Service knows of only 514 strikers.
	   There were at least five riots Monday in the West Bank.
Palestinian students _ some toting their homework in schoolbags _
ambushed cars with stones on the road between the Maaleh Adumim
settlement and Jerusalem.
	   Settler David Adawi opened fire from a van. Two students were
injured, one critically _ Nasr Erekat, 20, a first cousin of top
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   It was a repeat of a situation last week when a soldier fended
off blows after stone-throwing Palestinians managed to disable the
car he was in near Ramallah. But in that case, Cpl. Assaf Meyara
did not use his gun, and instead ran away.
	   His actions _ filmed and photographed _ were excoriated by many,
including Netanyahu.
	   ``If a soldier or civilian is caught in a life-threatening
situation, it is his right and even his obligation to save himself
in accordance with the law,'' he said.
	   The fact that both Meyara and Adawi are now both under police
investigation and may face charges for taking opposite tacks when
under attack could fuel the increasing perception that the peace
process is adrift.
	   Both major television news progrms drew comparisons between the
incidents, both caught on video.
	   ``Suddenly 100 to 200 Arabs with big stones surrounded us around
the car,'' said Adawi's driver, who would only give his name as
Michael, told Associated Press Television. ``They want to kill
us.''
	   The mixed signals over how to behave when under attack reflects
a wider confusion over the peace process. The accord between the
Israelis and Palestinians after the Wye talks quickly deteriorated
into mutual recriminations.

Yeltsin fires key aides during a brief break from hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin roused himself from his sickbed for
three hours Monday, fired several of his top aides and then
returned to a Kremlin hospital where he is recuperating from
pneumonia.
	   It was a classic performance from the ailing Russian president,
who rarely seems so energized as when he is firing someone. The
dismissed aides included officials who had commented recently on
the president's poor health.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin told his staff as he
delivered the news, according to presidential spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin.
	   Among those fired was Presidential Chief of Staff Valentin
Yumashev, one of Yeltsin's closest and most loyal aides. A former
journalist who was the ghost-writer of Yeltsin's memoirs, Yumashev
had served as chief of staff for nearly two years _ an eternity in
Yeltsin's Kremlin.
	   ``The president has found a way to revitalize his staff _ by
firing it,'' observed Alexander Shokhin, leader of the
pro-government bloc in parliament and, until recently, a steady
Yeltsin ally.
	   Shown on television, Yeltsin appeared animated and robust as he
scowled and delivered one of his patented tirades.
	   ``Tough discipline, order and reform is what we need,'' Yeltsin
said slowly and sternly as he glared at his staff from the head of
a long table. Aides looked down and scribbled notes.
	   Besides firing Yumashev and three of his deputies, Yeltsin
announced that he was personally taking charge of ``all power
ministries ... including the Justice Ministry and the tax police.''
	   ``Power ministries'' are usually defined as those related to
national defense and security. The Justice Ministry and tax police
are at the forefront of the fight against crime and corruption,
which has taken on new importance following the killing of a top
liberal lawmaker, Galina Starovoitova.
	   Yeltsin's announcement was seen as mostly symbolic, however,
since the president already wields authority over all the
ministries he mentioned and the ministers who head them were left
in place.
	   His remarks mostly suggested that Yeltsin is tired of being
portrayed as a figurehead who has relinquished all power to his
prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Primakov, appointed in September, has been left to tackle the
economic crisis that has mired the country deeper in poverty.
Yeltsin has said little and done less about the economy since it
went into a tailspin in August.
	   There has been a rising chorus of calls for the president's
resignation, based on his poor health, but Yeltsin has been
defiant, insisting that he will fill out his term until it ends in
2000.
	   Yeltsin has been hospitalized with pneumonia since Nov. 22, and
Yakushkin said he would remain in the hospital as long as necessary
to recuperate. He refused to speculate about how long that would
be.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the secretary of the presidential
security council, was appointed the new chief of staff, and
Vladimir Makarov, a former KGB officer, was named to one of the
deputy posts. The others remained vacant. Bordyuzha, who will keep
his security job, was formerly chief of the Border Guards.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin had dismissed the aides because of their
failure to stem crime or respond to several incidents of political
extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist parliament
deputy.
	   ``That undermines confidence in the president and in the
government as a whole, and that is inadmissible in the current
difficult economic situation,'' Yakushkin said.
	   Yeltsin has a habit of unexpected and often unexplained
dismissals. The latest round of ousters was also thought to reflect
his unhappiness over aides' unusual candidness about his health in
recent weeks.
	   Yumashev and other Kremlin aides openly said Yeltsin is too weak
to handle day-to-day affairs or to make foreign trips and suggested
he leave control of the economy and other current affairs to
Primakov.
	   ``The president wanted to show who is the boss,'' said Shokhin.
``He's like a lion who licked his wounds and now roared at those
who thought he was already out of the game.''

Russia calls for speedy lifting of U.N. sanctions on Iraq
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Assuming a familiar stance, Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz and Russian leaders on Monday expressed a
shared desire to see a swift end to the U.N. sanctions against
Baghdad.
	   ``We believe that soon the sanctions will be lifted,'' Russia's
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told a news conference after meeting
Aziz.
	   Despite Ivanov's optimism, there are no signs that the United
States and Britain, the leading proponents of sanctions, are
prepared to ease their position following repeated showdowns with
Iraq over weapons inspections.
	   Russia called for a ``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's
compliance with United Nations resolutions, saying this should help
wrap up seven years of U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``This review is to lead us to the lifting of the embargo,''
Ivanov said. ``We are approaching the end of a long process.''
	   When pushing its case for sanctions relief, Iraq often turns to
Russia, which has long had good relations with Baghdad and wants to
take part in rebuilding Iraq's shattered economy.
	   Iraq agreed to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors
last month after a confrontation that nearly led to military
strikes by the United States.
	   Aziz said he hoped that ``lawful and objective inspections''
could take place next month. And he again criticized the U.N.
Security Council for failing to end the embargo placed on Iraq
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``For more than seven years, Iraq has been following through on
its obligations, but the Security Council hasn't been meeting its
obligations,'' Aziz said. ``This is unacceptable.''
	   In Baghdad, meanwhile, Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan warned
that Iraq would not cooperate ``too long,'' saying arms inspectors
had a ``limited opportunity'' to wrap up their work.
	   U.N. inspectors say Baghdad has repeatedly hidden weapons
material and information that it must turn over to win sanctions
relief.
	   Aziz also met Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who has
mediated on several occasions when Iraq and the United Nations were
in the midst of confrontations.
	   While offering Iraq moral support, Russia insists that Baghdad
comply with U.N. resolutions that call for the dismantling of all
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq desperately wants to resume exporting oil at full capacity.
It is permitted only limited oil exports at present to buy food and
medicine.
	   Russia, meanwhile, wants to recover billions of dollars in debts
that Iraq ran up in the 1980s when it bought large quantities of
weapons to wage war with Iran.
	   Russian firms have already signed many large business contracts
with Iraq, but they can't be implemented until the sanctions are
lifted.

Russian ruble plunges further, World Bank team arrives for talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AM-Yeltsin, Bjt &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The ruble flirted with a new low Monday as the
arrival of a World Bank team for more loan talks did little to
assuage fears that Russia will be left without foreign aid.
	   The ruble rate has been the main indicator of economic
confidence since Russian financial markets were virtually wiped out
in August, and its fall reflected fears that Russia will begin
printing large sums of money to pay off its debts and cover the
budget deficit.
	   Substantial money-printing is certain to trigger high inflation.
	   Russia printed 3.5 billion rubles ($172 million) in October, and
10 billion rubles ($490 million) in November to cover the deficit,
Central Bank deputy head Tatyana Paramonova said Monday, according
to the Interfax news agency.
	   But the government has warned it would have to print much more
if no foreign aid arrives. Traders said Monday the Central Bank may
already have printed more money than it is willing to admit.
	   Russia's foreign debt will total $143.9 billion on Jan 1,
Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Monday, according to
Interfax.
	   Of this, $17.5 billion in servicing costs is due next year, but
Russia says it doesn't have the money and needs to reschedule some
of the debt. A government delegation will leave Dec. 9 for
rescheduling talks with the Paris Club of creditor nations, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Russia had hoped to cover the debt payments by dipping into the
$22.6 billion bailout package that the International Monetary Fund
put together in July. But the loan was frozen after Russia's
financial weaknesses and the global economic crisis prompted the
government to devalue the ruble and default on some debts in
August.
	   The World Bank team was to reconsider the terms of several loans
promised in the IMF-led loan package, including $1.5 billion for
structural reform and $800 million to streamline the ailing coal
industry, Interfax reported.
	   The team will make recommendations to the World Bank board of
directors later this month.
	   However, until the IMF acts, other foreign lenders are unlikely
to give Russia money. And the IMF is urging Russia to provide a
realistic budget for next year as a key condition for resuming
loans, and is showing no sign that it will free the money any time
soon.
	   The ruble sunk again Monday, hitting 20.4 to the dollar in the
official Central Bank rate _ down 0.8 rubles from Friday.
	   The ruble sold for more than 20 to the dollar shortly after the
crisis hit in August before making a mild comeback. It was about 6
to the dollar before the crisis.
	   Traders said the ruble's slide was slowed by intervention Monday
from the Central Bank _ which spends its hard-currency reserves to
buy rubles, thus increasing the demand and driving the ruble rate
back up.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Tightening their grip on power, Serbian
lawmakers passed a law Monday granting the president and other top
officials high salaries, paid servants and other lifelong
privileges despite deep poverty of average citizens.
	   The law, drafted and passed by neo-communist and
ultra-nationalist supporters of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, has been criticized by fledgling opposition parties and
independent media.
	   The laws are certain to put further financial strain on Serbia's
impoverished citizens. The country's average salary is about dlrs
50 a month, unemployment is approaching about 50 percent and the
annual inflation is about 60 percent.
	   The 250-seat assembly also adopted Serbia's 1999 budget and a
series of measures imposing hefty taxes on average citizens,
including their private cars, mobile phones and weapons.
	   Despite growing poverty, Milosevic and his government have so
far faced little unrest. The workers have avoided street protests,
fearing reprisals. Critics accuse autocratic Milosevic and his
aides of accumulating wealth while destroying Serbia's economy in
the past decade of their rule.
	   The government said it proposed the law because it would make
state officials, such as court judges and government ministers,
less corrupt by making them richer. Corruption on all levels has
taken deep root in the Serbian society.
	   In his opening speech, Premier Mirko Marjanovic praised
government achievements in the past year, blaming the hardship on
international isolation of Serbia and the additional costs of
financing a police crackdown in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian
rebels have been fighting for independence.
	   One-fourth of the 1999 budget, or 21.5 billion dinars (dlrs 2.1
billion), will go to financing police, the main pillar of
Milosevic's decade-long rule in Serbia. The rest will go to social
programs, education and other costs.
	   Under the law on ``the rights and obligations'' of the state
officials, the Serbian president, government ministers, state
prosecutors, judges, parliament deputies and some other top
officials, will receive salaries 10 to 20 times the national
average.
	   The president of Serbia will enjoy benefits such as a lifelong
special residence provided by the government. He will travel free
of charge and have lifelong pension worth 85 percent of the salary
as active president.
	   After his mandate expires, the president will be granted a
residence, three pairvants, a car and an administrative clerk. His
wife also will enjoy benefits.
	   Other top Serbian officials would have since 1990 when Milosevic
was president of Serbia.
	   Milosevic became president of Yugoslavia, which includes Serbia
and Montenegro, in July 1997.
	   ``There is no end to the arrogance and greed of the authorities,
and their cruel scoffing of mhe opposition Serb Democratic Party
said in a statement. ``The law ... is really a law on enriching the
state officials.''
	   Opposition leader Milan Panic, an American businessman of Serb
origin, said that there is a good thing about the law:
	   ``It's a good sign. They are thinking about pensions, so they
are planning to retire.''

Gulf leaders to focus on oil at annual summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with speeches by Annan, Mandela, falling oil prices. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Six Arab Gulf leaders
opened an annual summit Monday that was expected to focus on
falling oil prices, which have hit their economies hard.
	   Shortly before the meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council
began, January futures contracts for Brent crude _ a widely watched
benchmark _ fell to a record low of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on the
International Petroleum Exchange in London.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent.
	   The Gulf oil producers, who control about half of global oil
reserves, have been hard hit by the oil market crisis, which has
been blamed on the recession in Asia and warmer-than-usual winters.
Oil exports account for some 75 percent of their revenues.
	   For the first time, the GCC summit is being attended by leaders
outside the group, including U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
South African President Nelson Mandela.
	   Both told the opening session of the three-day summit that they
hoped the Wye River agreement, brokered by U.S. President Bill
Clinton between Israel and the Palestinians, would lead to peace in
the Middle East.
	   Annan made no mention of his talks with Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi, whom he met Saturday in a desert tent in Jerba, Libya, to
try and arrange the trial of two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing
of a Pan Am jet. The bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, killed 270
people.
	   Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for failing to
surrender the men. The United States and Britain have proposed
holding a trial with Scottish judges in the Netherlands _ and idea
Annan is trying to get Gadhafi to accept.
	   ``We are well on the way to resolving the problem,'' Annan told
U.S. Secretary Madeleine Albright by telephone on Sunday, according
to a U.N. statement.
	   The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and
the United Arab Emirates in a federation aimed at economic and
defense cooperation.
	   The summit host, the United Arab Emirates, said Sunday that
trying to stabilize oil prices, which are hovering at 12-year lows
of between dlrs 10 and dlrs 11, will be the main topic of
discussion at the GCC.
	   Diplomatic sources in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, said that the
kingdom intended to$propose a GCC cartel to try to shore up prices.
	   In his speech, Annan said he was ``saddened and burdened'' by
Iraq's repeated confrontations with U.N. weapons inspectors, which
have raised tensions in the region.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before punishing U.N. trade sanctions, imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, can be lifted.
	   ``We all want to move toward the lifting of sanctions one day so
that Iraq can regain its rightful place among the community of
nations,'' Annan said. This, he said, requires Iraq ``to comply
with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.''
	   According to Emirates officials and Western diplomats, who
insisted on anonymity, the summit was also to discuss American and
British efforts to overthrow Saddam Hussein and the U.S. plan to
set up a ``shield'' of missile batteries in the region.
	   Annan also appealed in his speech to both Israel and the
Palestinians to work toward peace. He said violence should not
derail their efforts.
	   ``The recent signing of the Wye River memorandum by Israel and
the Palestine Liberation Organization, coming as it did after many
months of uncertainly and concern over the future of the peace
process, is an encouraging development,'' Annan said. ``We
earnestly hope that this agreement will be implemented in all its
aspects and will pave the way for the resumption of negotiations on
all tracks.''
	   Mandela told the GCC leaders: ``After the revival of hope that
these (Wye River) negotiations brought, it would be nothing short
of tragic if failure to abide by agreements _ including the release
of political prisoners _ again frustrated the aspirations of the
Palestinian people for justice and the yearning of the whole region
and the world for peace in the Middle East.''
	   As a show of force ahead of the summit, Iran's navy and its
elite Revolutionary Guards began five days of naval maneuvers on
Friday in the Gulf. Some 50,000 men and dozens of warships are
taking part.
	   On Monday, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported
that the exercises were testing a new missile guidance system
code-named Mersad.

Hearing for lung cancer sufferers' law suit begins in London

 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES graf 1 to show all the cancer sufferers were

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Preliminary hearings opened at the High Court on
Monday in a case which 52 smokers who have contracted lung cancer
hope will be Britain's first class-action suit against tobacco
companies.
	   Attorney Brian Langstaff is bringing eight test cases to seek a
judgment on whether 36 of the cancer sufferers who were longtime
smokers are too late to take legal action.
	   Under English law, most personal injury claims have to be lodged
within three years, although a judge can use discretion to waive
the rule.
	   The remainder of the cancer sufferers in the suit against
Imperial Tobacco Ltd. and Gallaher Ltd. are within the three-year
time limit.
	   Although tobacco lawsuits have been fought for years in the
United States, the law is not tested in Britain.
	   Attorneys for the cancer patients are fighting the case under a
1995 law that allows lawyers to handle ``group action'' cases,
similar to class-action lawsuits in America, without charging
unless they win.
	   Imperial Tobacco, which has 39 percent of the British cigarette
market, said it would contest the arguments of lawyers representing
the cancer patients.
	   ``We are querying why this is different to other cases,'' said
Paul Sadler, spokesman for Imperial Tobacco, referring to the
three-year time limit.
	   Langstaff told the judge, Sir Michael Wright, that his eight
clients had suffered injury because the cigarettes they bought
between the 1950s and 1970s contained more tar than was reasonably
safe or appropriate.
	   Under English law, companies have to minimize risk to people
from their actions.
	   Attorney Martyn Day, whose law company has undertaken the
action, has argued that he can show that Gallaher and Imperial
Tobacco were negligent by reducing tar levels in cigarettes too
slowly through the years.
	   Day has estimated some 20,000 of the 35,000 people who get lung
cancer every year in Britain could collect awards of 50,000 pounds
(dlrs 80,000) each. That comes to 1 billion pounds (dlrs 1.6
billion), more than the two tobacco companies' annual profits of
900 million pounds (dlrs 1.44 billion).
	   The current hearing is expected two weeks.

Yeltsin's new chief of staff criticizes high-level corruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Russia-Yeltsin &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After his unexpected appointment Monday, Boris
Yeltsin's new chief of staff said he would focus on rooting out
corruption, calling it a problem up to the ``upper echelons.''
	   Yeltsin named Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, formerly head of Russia's
Border Guards, his chief of staff after firing several aides in a
rare Kremlin appearance Monday. Yeltsin then returned to the
hospital where he is recuperating from pneumonia.
	   Bordyuzha said fighting crime and corruption would be one of his
key goals.
	   ``Fighting corruption is very important today, including in the
upper echelons of power,'' he said in an interview with Russia's
NTV television.
	   He also said, ``We should ... make sure that all decisions made
at the highest levels are implemented unswervingly and promptly,
without any discussion.''
	   Bordyuzha, 49, is also secretary of the presidential security
council, a job he will keep along with his new post.

U.N. General Assembly approves Cambodia seat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. General Assembly gave Cambodia's
seat in the world body to the new coalition government Monday after
a 15-month vacancy, but no representative was in the chamber to sit
in the country's chair.
	   Without a vote, the Assembly approved by consensus the
Credentials Committee's decision Friday to give Cambodia's seat to
the coalition led by Hun Sen.
	   Cambodia's seat was left empty after Hun Sen's July 1997 ouster
of co-prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh in a violent coup.
	   Supporters of both men presented competing claims for the
country's seat after the coup and the Credentials Committee decided
in September 1997 to keep the seat vacant.
	   The panel again deferred a decision last October after Ranariddh
and his political allies disputed Hun Sen's narrow victory in a
July election and blocked formation of a new government.
	   Ranariddh bowed to international pressure last month and struck
a coalition deal in which Hun Sen became prime minister and the
prince was named president of the National Assembly.
	   In Phnom Penh on Saturday, Information Minister Lu Laysreng, a
member of Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party, said the U.N. recognition
will help Cambodia's drive to join the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations and attract foreign aid suspended after last year's
crisis.
	   ``It's great. A legal government was formed so we deserve our
seat back. We are grateful,'' Lu Laysreng said.
	   Cambodia has been pushing hard to join ASEAN in time for the
regional grouping's Dec. 15-16 summit in Vietnam.
	   Vietnam strongly supports Cambodia's bid, but Singapore and the
Philippines have signaled that the troubled nation should prove
that its new government is stable before gaining entry.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian police opened fire Monday on
rioters protesting Israel's refusal to release Palestinian
prisoners _ the first sign that the Palestinian police were
containing violence in advance of President Bill Clinton's visit
this week.
	   In the West Bank city of Nablus, Palestinian police took to the
rooftops and fired onto a crowd of some 3,000 Palestinians, mostly
bystanders who had gathered to watch the rioting. Witnesses said at
least five people were wounded and taken away to hospitals.
	   A Jewish settler driving near the city of Jenin, also in the
northern West Bank, was shot and wounded from gunfire towards his
car, Israel radio reported. The settler, a resident of the nearby
settlement of Ganim, managed to drive to an Israeli army outpost
several kilometers (miles) away and was taken from there to a
hospital in Afula.
	   Protests on the prisoner issue swept through the West Bank, both
in Israeli-controlled and Palestinian-controlled areas. A settler
opened fire on rioters on a major road to Jerusalem, and two youths
were injured _ one critically.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who hailed Clinton's upcoming
trip as ``historical and great,'' is anxious to show that the
Palestinians are meeting the conditions of the U.S.-brokered accord
reached at Wye River in Maryland in October.
	   Earlier in Nablus, loyalists of Fatah _ a movement started by
Arafat _ surrounded the police station and began lobbing stones and
fire bombs inside. They torched police vehicles and tried to storm
the gates of the prison.
	   Police opened fire on the protesters, injuring at least seven,
according to hospital sources.
	   The Fatah protest had been prompted by the methods club-wielding
riot police had used during the day against mothers of prisoners
who were demonstrating to press Arafat to pressure Israel to
release prisoners.
	   Clinton will visit Gaza _ the first sitting U.S. President to do
so _ and open a meeting of the Palestinian National Council.
Palestinians and Israelis alike see the visit as tacit endorsement
of Palestinian hopes of statehood.
	   The Palestinians exhibited confiscated weapons to CIA officials
on Monday in an effort to prove that they are meeting Wye's
security commitments.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has accused the
Palestinian Authority of stage-managing the riots, was not
enthusiastic about the Clinton visit.
	   ``I hope Mr. Clinton uses his visit to demand Palestinian
compliance,'' he told Israel television.
	   Israel was already balking at withdrawal plans worked out at
Wye.
	   ``We have to find out whether (the Palestinians) are living up
to their committments,'' said top Netanyahu adviser David
Bar-Illan. ``So far the conclusion is that it will be very
difficult to implement the next withdrawal on time.''
	   The Palestinian Authority _ which denies accusations that it
backs the rioters _ has accused Netanyahu of fanning the flames by
reneging on a prisoner release commitment achieved at Wye.
	   Israel released 250 prisoners last month, but most were common
criminals, instead of the security prisoners the Palestinians had
hoped through. Netanyahu insists that he will not release the
security prisoners, whom he describes as murderers.
	   The prisoners have gone on a hunger strike that they say
encompasses all 3,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails. The Israel
Prisons Service knows of only 514 strikers.
	   There were at least five riots in the West Bank Monday.
Palestinian students _ some toting their homework in schoolbags _
ambushed cars with stones on the road between the Maaleh Adumim
settlement and Jerusalem.
	   Settler David Adawi opened fire from a van. Two students were
injured, one critically _ Nasr Erekat, 20, a first cousin of top
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   It was a repeat of a situation last week when a soldier fended
off blows after stone-throwing Palestinians managed to disable the
car he was in near Ramallah. But in that case, Cpl. Assaf Meyara
did not use his gun, and instead ran away.
	   His actions _ filmed and photographed _ were excoriated by many,
including Netanyahu.
	   ``If a soldier or civilian is caught in a life-threatening
situation, it is his right and even his obligation to save himself
in accordance with the law,'' he said.
	   The fact that both Meyara and Adawi are now both under police
investigation and may face charges for taking opposite tacks when
under attack could fuel the increasing perception that the peace
process is adrift.
	   Both major television news programs drew comparisons between the
incidents, both caught on video.
	   ``Suddenly 100 to 200 Arabs with big stones surrounded us around
the car,'' said Adawi's driver, who would only give his name as
Michael, told Associated Press Television. ``They want to kill
us.''
	   The mixed signals over how to behave when under attack reflects
a wider confusion over the peace process. The accord between the
Israelis and Palestinians after the Wye talks quickly deteriorated
into mutual recriminations.
	   Israel's opposition _ which sought support for an early
elections bill in the parliament on Monday _ blamed Netanyahu's
struggle to keep his coalition afloat for creating an atmosphere of
driftlessness.
	   ``The Prime Minister is busy with another trick, another
maneuver, with one purpose, not for the economy, not peace, but
only to survive,'' Labor party frontbencher Haim Ramon said. ``He
has no time for the real problems.''

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's first round
of job-creation talks among unions, employers and lawmakers ended
Monday with promises for lower business taxes and better early
retirement packages.
	   Putting Germany's 4 million unemployed back to work is the key
promise of Schroeder's new government, and the talks were an
important test of his goals and strategies. The chancellor himself
led the discussion and afterward deemed it a ``good beginning.''
	   On the agenda was a suggestion to lower the retirement age to 60
to open jobs for younger workers. It was rejected in favor of
sweetening incentives for older workers to retire voluntarily,
although no specifics were mentioned a news conference after the
talks.
	   The three sides also agreed that the government should lower
business taxes in 2000 _ sooner than expected _ so employers can
have more financial means for creating jobs.
	   Talks participant Dieter Hundt, the president of the Germany's
employers association, stressed the importance of decreasing the
tax burden on businesses as a way of easing unemployment, now at
10.1 percent.
	   Leaders from all sides looked pleased and relaxed after the
talks, although the meeting started on a tense note with quarreling
between unions and employers over wages. Employers have criticized
union demands to raise wages by as much as 6.5 percent as
counterproductive to the goal of job creation.
	   Germany's largest employers group, the German Industry
Association, had asked that wage issues be part of Monday's
discussion. But Dieter Schulte of the Federation of German Unions
rejected the proposal as an attempt to limit raises. ``Working
families need more money in their pockets,'' he was quoted Monday
as saying in the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
	   Both sides, however, showed a willingness to compromise on
overtime and part-time jobs. Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine has
threatened to introduce legislation limiting overtime if the sides
don't reach an agreement on the point.
	   Schroeder, five cabinet ministers and nine representatives of
German industrial groups and unions participated in the first
talks. The next round will be held Feb. 25.
	   Not invited to Monday's session were medium-sized businesses,
those with no more than 500 workers and annual sales up to 100
million marks (dlrs 59 million). This was a disappointment, group
chief Mario Ohoven said, considering that Germany's medium-sized
businesses employ 25 million workers.
	   Other employee groups at the talks included the German Chamber
of Industry and Commerce, the craftsmen's association and the
employers association. On the union side: IG Metall; the chemical
workers' IG Chemie; the public sector union OeTV; and the
employees' union DAG.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian police opened fire Monday on
rioters protesting Israel's refusal to release Palestinian
prisoners _ the first sign that the Palestinians were containing
violence ahead of U.S. President Bill Clinton's weekend visit.
	   In the West Bank city of Nablus, Palestinian police took to the
rooftops and fired onto a crowd of 3,000 Palestinians, mostly
bystanders who gathered to watch the rioting. Witnesses said at
least five people were wounded and taken to hospitals.
	   Protests on the prisoner issue swept the West Bank, both in
Israeli-controlled and Palestinian-controlled areas. A settler
opened fire on rioters on a major road to Jerusalem, injuring two
youths _ one critically.
	   A Jewish settler driving near the city of Jenin, also in the
northern West Bank, was wounded by gunfire aimed at his car, Israel
radio reported. The settler, a resident of the nearby settlement of
Ganim, drove to an Israeli army outpost several miles (kilometers)
away and was taken to a hospital.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who hailed Clinton's trip as

Traditional demonstrations at La Scala gala night

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Keeping to the tradition of turbulence for
La Scala galas, animal right activists shouted insults at patrons
in furs showing up Monday night for the opera season opening.
	   ``Murderers'' and ``Shame'' were among the shouts from the from
the activists, who waved flags and exploded some firecrackers as
riot policemen forced them behind metal barricades about 50 meters
(yards) from the downtown theater.
	   Two activists managed to reach the foyer but were driven away by
plainclothes policemen.
	   ``There is more drama in the cloak room of this theater than on
the stage,'' shouted Dan Matthews, the American leader of an
animals rights group. Italian socialite Marina Ripa di Meana, a
long-time supporter of animal rights activists, flashed to the
photographers and television cameramen her naked breasts with the
violet inscription ``No Furs.''
	   ``Better naked than in fur,'' said Ripa de Meana. ``It's not
fashion, it's just cruelty,'' Ripa di Meana said.
	   Another group of protesters shouted political slogans against
the mayor and ``buffoons'' to theatergoers who paid up to dlrs
1,000 a seat for the premiere.
	   Some women left their furs in their limousines and dared
close-to-zero (32F) temperatures as they walked to the theater in
flimsy dresses.
	   Others strode in their fur coats.
	   La Scala opera season was inaugurated with Richard Wagner's
``Gotterdammerung'' conducted by maestro Riccardo Muti.
	   Wolfgang Schmidt, Jane Eaglen and Waltraud Meier played the main
roles of the opera sung in German and nearly six hours long.
	   The opening night of La Scala opera season, on the patron saint
day of St. Ambrose, often has seen vocal protests.
	   Every year since 1968 there have been demonstrations by
students, animal right activists, jobless workers, strikers and
even traffic policemen.

Doctor now charged in eight patient deaths

<TEXT>
	   ASHTON-UNDER-LYNE, England (AP) _ A family doctor stands charged
with murdering eight of his patients to gain their money, as
authorities continue to exhume bodies of women who died
mysteriously under his care.
	   Harold Shipman, 52, the family doctor from the northern England
town of Hyde in greater Manchester, was ordered Monday to stand
trial in connection with three more deaths, bringing the total to
eight. Authorities, meanwhile, exhumed the body of 75-year-old
Sarah Ashworth from her grave in Dukinfield, greater Manchester.
	   Shipman was charged with murder in the first four deaths in
September after police exhumed the women's bodies. He is to appear
in court again Tuesday to on charges of another woman's death.
	   All eight women died between December 1997 and June 1998,
authorities said. Mrs. Ashworth, whose body was exhumed MOnday,
died in April 1993.
	   Shipman will appear in Liverpool Crown Court on Tuesday for a
plea in the first case, in which he is charged with murdering
81-year-old widow Kathleen Grundy, falsely obtaining cash and
property worth 300,000 pounds (dlrs 500,000) from her estate, and
forging a will and two letters.

Most seats for St. Petersburg elections go to runoffs

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Most local legislative seats up
for grabs in Russia's second largest city of St. Petersburg will go
to runoffs after an election that was marred by bomb threats and
complaints of voter fraud.
	   Officials said Monday that just six of 50 seats were decided in
Sunday's election for the St. Petersburg legislative assembly,
while the rest will go to runoffs scheduled for December 20.
	   The six seats were all held by incumbent assembly deputies.
Candidates must get more than 50 percent of the vote to win in the
first round, or the top two vote winners face each other in a
second round.
	   Liberals took a prominent lead in the first round of voting,
with 22 members of the liberal Yabloko party and nine people from
other reform-minded parties still in the race.
	   Ten communists, as well as the city's former police chief, a
movie actress and the author of a tell-all book about the former
mayor of St. Petersburg are also still in the running.
	   Observers were eager to see how the elections would reflect
public reaction to rising crime in St. Petersburg, including the
Nov. 20 killing of Galina Starovoitova, a member of the Russian
parliament who supported a liberal bloc of candidates in the
elections.
	   Starovoitova supporters speculated she was killed so that her
faction, Northern Capital, would fare poorly in the election. Her
death, however, may have had the opposite effect, rallying liberal
voters.
	   In addition, hitmen have killed a legislative aide, a
high-ranking city official and a prominent banker in St. Petersburg
in the last two months.
	   Dirty politics in St. Petersburg were reflected in the
elections, which were marred by violence, racial slurs against
Jewish candidates and complaints of ballot box stuffing.
	   The City Electoral Commission also reported complaints of voter
bribery, and bomb threats forced the temporary closure of three
stations.
	   Still, voter turnout was high by Russian standards _ around 40
percent.
	   The city's governor, Vladimir Yakovlev, on Monday praised the
turnout and the elections.
	   He also added: ``The talk that St. Petersburg is the hub of the
underworld must stop,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Yakovlev's critics said his supporters contributed to the
mean-spirited atmosphere surrounding the election. Yakovlev's
opponents found that people with names identical to theirs
mysteriously wound up on the ballot in an apparent attempt to
confuse voters and take away votes from liberals.

Nobel Lit lecture: peasant's son Saramago tells how he became a

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Somewhere along the way, Nobel
Literature laureate Jose Saramago says, his characters took on
lives of their own.
	   When his first book took shape nearly 60 years ago, he figured
his ``men and women of paper and ink'' were ``obedient to my will
... like puppets,'' Saramago said Monday evening in his prize
lecture.
	   To his surprise, they developed so far that he sensed they had
become his master and he their apprentice.
	   ``Letter by letter, word by word, page by page, book after book:
I have been successively implanting in the man I was the characters
I created,'' he said. ``I believe that without them, I wouldn't be
the person I am today....
	   ``I don't have, as it were, more voice than the voices they had.
Forgive me if what has seemed little to you, to me is all.''
	   It has been a winding, unpredictable road for the slender,
quizzical-looking peasant's son who trained to be a mechanic, all
the while spending nights voraciously reading poetry at public
libraries.
	   He walked barefoot _ ``with straws still stuck in my hair'' _
until he was 14. Now 76, he is the toast of the literary world,
lecturing several hundred people in fine clothes at the august
Swedish Academy in an ornate room with busts, statues and 13
glittering chandeliers.
	   The avowed communist and atheist seemed slightly embarrassed, if
secretly amused or pleased, at the standing ovation. He
acknowledged the applause with quick deferential nods, and tried
unsuccessfully to draw his wife from her front-row seat to the
stage with him.
	   He was more relaxed two evenings before when he spoke with
reporters at the airport shortly after arrival.
	   Celebrity, not to mention the prize money of 7.6 million kronor
(dlrs 950,000), is gratifying but ``It wouldn't be worth it to
change your life ... just because of a prize,'' he said.
	   Saramago's roots were his early literary inspiration. In his
half-hour lecture, he recalled sleeping outdoors under a fig tree
while his grandfather _ a manual laborer who never lost his sense
of the world's wonder _ would tell stories under the stars.
	   ``The wisest man I ever knew in my whole life could not read or
write,'' were his lecture's opening words. From personal memories,
his writing touched universal themes. His sympathies were always
with the common man.
	   With his usual irony and humor, he took potshots at familiar
targets: organized religion, particularly the Roman Catholic
Church, authoritarian governments, greedy landlords and intolerance
of every stripe.

	   BAIE-COMEAU, Quebec (AP) _ A twin-engine plane with about 10
people aboard crashed Monday in shallow waters of the St. Lawrence
River. Three people were rescued, but the others were feared
trapped in the wreckage.
	   A civilian helicopter rescued three of those on board and flew
them to a hospital, according to an official at the search and
rescue center in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
	   But Lt. Jason Proulx said there was no sign of the other people
on board, and they were believed trapped inside the fuselage under
water. Asked about the prospects of other survivors, he said,
``It's not looking good, but I'd rather not speculate.''
	   Proulx said the plane, a Britten-Norman Islander, was sitting in
shallow water, with only its tail sticking out above the surface.
There conflicting reports about the number of people on board,
ranging from nine to 11.
	   A coast guard vessel and rescue aircraft were sent to the scene.
	   The plane went down near the Quebec town of Baie-Comeau, on the
north shore of the St. Lawrence about 180 miles (300 kilometers)
northeast of Quebec City.
	   Richard Gagne, a Quebec provincial police spokesman, said the
plane crashed shortly after taking off from Baie-Comeau en route to
Rimouksi, a town on the south side of the river. The St. Lawrence
is about 30 miles (50 kilometers) wide at Baie-Comeau.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Tightening their grip on power,
Serbian lawmakers passed a law Monday granting the president and
other top officials high salaries, paid servants and other lifelong
privileges despite deep poverty of average citizens.
	   The law, drafted and passed by neo-communist and
ultra-nationalist supporters of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, has been criticized by fledgling opposition parties and
independent media.
	   The laws are certain to put further financial strain on Serbia's
impoverished citizens. The country's average salary is about dlrs
50 a month, unemployment is approaching about 50 percent and the
annual inflation is about 60 percent.
	   The 250-seat assembly also adopted Serbia's 1999 budget and a
series of measures imposing hefty taxes on average citizens,
including their private cars, mobile phones and weapons.
	   Despite growing poverty, Milosevic and his government have so
far faced little unrest. The workers have avoided street protests,
fearing reprisals. Critics accuse autocratic Milosevic and his
aides of accumulating wealth while destroying Serbia's economy in
the past decade of their rule.
	   The government said it proposed the law because it would make
state officials, such as court judges and government ministers,
less corrupt by making them richer. Corruption on all levels has
taken deep root in the Serbian society.
	   In his opening speech, Premier Mirko Marjanovic praised
government achievements in the past year, blaming the hardship on
international isolation of Serbia and the additional costs of
financing a police crackdown in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanian
rebels have been fighting for independence.
	   One-fourth of the 1999 budget, or 21.5 billion dinars (dlrs 2.1
billion), will go to financing police, the main pillar of
Milosevic's decade-long rule in Serbia. The rest will go to social
programs, education and other costs.
	   Under the law on ``the rights and obligations'' of the state
officials, the Serbian president, government ministers, state
prosecutors, judges, parliament deputies and some other top
officials, will receive salaries 10 to 20 times the national
average.
	   The president of Serbia will enjoy benefits such as a lifelong
special residence provided by the government. He will travel free
of charge and have lifelong pension worth 85 percent of the salary
as active president.
	   After his mandate expires, the president will be granted a
residence, servants, a car and an administrative clerk. His wife
also will enjoy benefits.
	   Other top Serbian officials would have similar privileges, which
also include personal bodyguards for the official, his family and
house. The law is to be implemented retroactively, for the period
since 1990 when Milosevic was president of Serbia.
	   Milosevic became president of Yugoslavia, which includes Serbia
and Montenegro, in July 1997.
	   ``There is no end to the arrogance and greed of the authorities,
and their cruel scoffing of millions of impoverished citizens,''
the opposition Serb Democratic Party said in a statement. ``The law
... is really a law on enriching the state officials.''
	   Opposition leader Milan Panic, an American businessman of Serb
origin, said that there is a good thing about the law:
	   ``It's a good sign. They are thinking about pensions, so they
are planning to retire.''

Despite internal struggles, EU remains upbeat on expansion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with statement on enlargement. No Pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The EU foreign ministers failed to
overcome disagreements Monday about European Union expansion, yet
tried to welcome newcomers even without setting specific entry
dates for them.
	   The ministers failed to break an impasse on the rate of EU
expansion and how to fund it _ issues that will dominate a two-day
summit opening Friday in Vienna.
	   Yet they sent the summit an upbeat report, saying efforts to
bring Cyprus, 10 East European nations and, possibly, Malta into
the EU in the next decade are well on track.
	   That did not hide a North-South split about enlargement and what
needs to be done do to make it possible.
	   Negotiations opened this fall with Cyprus, Hungary, Poland, the
Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia. Preliminary talks opened with
Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria, who are on a
slower track.
	   Despite prodding from the East, the EU refuses to set entry
dates to ensure candidates keep up efforts to get ready for
membership.
	   In a statement, the foreign ministers lauded the ``inclusive and
dynamic nature of the enlargement process'' and said as a whole
candidates were making good progress getting in shape for
membership.
	   Greece objected to mentioning Turkey, which is not negotiating
membership due to its dubious human rights record. The statement
said that EU governments ``generally shared'' the view that Turkey
would be a full-fledged candidate in the future.
	   The first newcomers won't join until 2004 or 2005.
	   Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are expected to get in
first. The Netherlands, Germany, France and Italy have doubts about
admitting a divided Cyprus.
	   Germany and France opposed accelerating talks with Lithuania,
Latvia and Slovakia _ slow-trackers which the EU head office says
do better than expected in getting ready for membership.
	   Before enlargement can occur, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands,
Sweden and France insist on a fundamental reform of EU finances.
	   They want the EU budget to rise until 2006 only in line with
inflation from this year's level of 86 billion European currency
units (dlrs 100 billion) and oppose a European Commission proposal
to link spending to economic growth, raising the budget by 20
billion ecu (dlrs 23.6 billion).
	   Spain and other southerners held out for increased membership
fees, fearful they will lose special aid deals once even poorer
easterners come into the EU.
	   Germany and other northern members say they already pay far more
into the EU than they get back and want to limit their net
contributions. Germany's net payment is 22 billion marks (dlrs 13
billion) a year.
	   Complicating the money debate is Britain's refusal to give up an
annual rebate which it has been getting since 1984.
	   Worth 2.6 billion pounds (dlrs 4 billion) this year, that rebate
was granted to offset London's net payment but its partners argue
Britain is much better off now than 14 years ago.

U.S. envoy urges Palestinians, Israelis to honor Wye accords
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A senior U.S. diplomat on Monday urged the
Palestinians and Israel to honor the Wye River peace deal, saying
the United States was not the only party shouldering responsibility
for the Middle East peace process.
	   The United States is ``committed to securing implementation and
helping both parties to live up to their commitments,'' said Martin
Indyk, assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs.
	   Indyk's comments came at a news conference after he attended a
meeting of the U.S.-Egypt Strategic Dialogue, a joint initiative
aimed at ensuring cooperation on political and diplomatic issues.
	   Indyk noted that there was much suspicion between the Israelis
and Palestinians to be overcome.
	   ``We cannot go immediately from lack of trust to a kind of bed
of roses,'' Indyk said.
	   He said the United States was trying to create ``an
environment'' for constructive dialogue to take place to move peace
forward.
	   ``We are not the only ones with a responsibility,'' he added.
	   President Bill Clinton is scheduled to visit Israel and the
Palestinian territories next weekend despite disputes that threaten
the agreement reached at Wye River, Maryland, in October.
	   Palestinians claim Israel has violated the accords by failing to
free jailed political activists and allowing the expansion of
Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday accused
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat of ``making a farce'' of the
accords and said he would not agree to further troop withdrawals
from the West Bank until anti-Israel violence was stopped.
	   The Strategic Dialogue talks were to continue Tuesday with the
focus on counterterrorism and Egyptian-U.S. trade.

Car bomb seriously injures driver
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A powerful car bomb seriously injured a
local businessman Monday, but initial police reports ruled out the
possibility that the explosion was the result of a terrorist
attack.
	   Police said Nikos Grigorakos, 30, was seriously injured when a
bomb planted inside his car exploded as he tried to enter the
vehicle in a suburb of the capital.
	   They said Grigorakos, a Greek born in Hanover, Germany,
apparently ran a small company that made electronic counters.
	   Police said Grigorakos had been arrested two years ago along
with five other Greeks involved in running protection rackets
around the capital.

Syria seen adopting a new approach toward Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Syria's pivotal role in resolving the
frequent political crises among its allies in the Lebanese
government seems to be subtly changing with the new administration
of Lebanese President Emile Lahoud.
	   In the past, the Beirut-Damascus highway was virtually a
pilgrimage route for Lebanese politicians seeking favors from Syria
and returning to make pronouncements _ which were taken as Syria's
view.
	   But since Lahoud was elected with backing from Syrian President
Hafez Assad in October, there is silence from the Syrian capital,
suggesting a new hands-off approach in the day-to-day governing of
its smaller, weaker Arab neighbor.
	   The door to Damascus has since been reported by the Lebanese
press to be virtually shut, and kowtowing Lebanese politicians have
been told by Syria to return home.
	   This does not change Syria's domination of this country, which
rests on the presence of 30,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon. To some,
Syria is the guarantor of the agreement that ended Lebanon's
1975-90 civil war.
	   The Lebanese press has made only vague references to what
prompted the about-face in Syria's approach, but the Saudi-owned
Asharq al-Awsat on Monday quoted political circles in Damascus as
offering a more direct reason.
	   The London-based newspaper reported that Bashar Assad, the
Syrian leader's son, has taken over handling Lebanon. That job had
been handled by Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam, long Syria's
expert on Lebanese politics.
	   Bashar, who has the military rank of lieutenant colonel and is
commander-in-chief of Syria's Republican Guards, has taken on
political prominence following the death of his elder brother Basil
in a 1994 car crash.
	   Rumors had been swirling in Beirut that the stunning political
changes of the last week that saw the sudden replacement of Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri by Salim Hoss had the tacit blessing of
Damascus.
	   Hariri _ who had been regarded as Syria's ally _ quit
unexpectedly in an apparent power struggle with Lahoud.
	   Lahoud appointed Hoss, who shares the president's views that
revitalizing the economy and battling government corruption must be
Lebanon's main goals. Asharq Al-Awsat suggested that similar
reforms could follow in Syria.
	   The developments in Lebanon also could be a prelude to preparing
Bashar for more power in his own country by tightening his grip
over Lebanon. After Lahoud's election, Bashar traveled to Beirut to
personally lend his backing to the new president.
	   One holdover on Hoss' Cabinet is ex-militia leader Suleiman
Franjieh, who is reported in the Arab media to be a friend of
Bashar.
	   During the power struggle, there was no trip by Hariri to
Damascus, a departure from the familiar pattern of past Lebanese
political crises.
	   Beirut news reports _ denied by Hariri aides _ said that the
then-prime minister planned a trip but was told by Syrian officials
that it was not necessary.
	   Walid Jumblatt, leader of the Druse minority and an outspoken
former Cabinet minister, on Sunday became the first to proclaim
publicly that Hariri was ousted in a ``bloodless coup.''
	   Political columnist Sarkis Naoum hinted in Monday's leading
An-Nahar newspaper that Hariri was driven from power as a result of
a decision from ``influential powers'' _ meaning Syria _ in
coordination with senior Lebanese politicians.
	   He said the former prime minister should have understood the
message. ``Hariri should have known ... that it was time that he
decided to rest,'' Naoum added.

DiMaggio suffers serious setback; lung infection back
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with background, age. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HOLLYWOOD, Florida (AP) _ Joe DiMaggio suffered a serious
setback over the weekend in his recovery from lung cancer surgery,
his doctor said Monday.
	   ``Joe has had a significant and serious turn for the worse,''
Dr. Earl Barron told The Associated Press. ``The outlook has dimmed
over the past 72 hours. He's not in good shape.''
	   Barron said DiMaggio's lung infection had returned and that he
had developed a fever.
	   ``He is being treated with antibiotics and his blood pressure is
being maintained with medications,'' the doctor said.
	   The 84-year-old Hall of Fame baseball star remains in intensive
care where he has been for much of the time since entering Memorial
Regional Hospital on Oct. 12. He underwent surgery to have a
cancerous tumor removed from his right lung two days later.
	   ``I saw him this morning,'' Barron said Monday. ``We are
continuing supportive care. The outlook is not as good as it was a
few days ago.''
	   DiMaggio has had several setbacks since the surgery.
	   His lungs were drained at least twice in October when they
filled with fluid from an infection.
	   On Nov. 16, DiMaggio's blood pressure dropped precipitously,
prompting a Roman Catholic priest to be summoned to give him the
last rites.
	   He was visited for his 84th birthday on Nov. 25 by relatives,
including his brother Dom. On Thanksgiving Day, he was buoyed by a
visit from his great granddaughters, Valerie, 9, and Vanessa, 11.

Swiss man loses snowball fight with bears
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ A man had to be rescued by firefighters
Monday when he climbed into the Swiss capital's historic bear pit
and pelted two bears with snowballs, city police said.
	   The 35-year-old, who wasn't identified, was taken to hospital
with ``considerable flesh wounds'' to his legs and shoulder after
climbing into the enclosure and throwing snowballs at the two
bears, named Selma and Urs.
	   Despite bystanders'attempts to distract her with food, the
female bear grabbed him by the shoulder and dragged him into her
cage, police added.
	   The bear let go of the intruder only when her keeper banged on
the bars of the cage with a metal object.
	   The city's name derives from the German word for bears and the
animal features on its coat of arms. Bears have been kept in the
pits since the 15th century.

IRA holds `convention' over deadlock in Northern Ireland accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with IRA meeting, changes throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Leaders of the Irish Republican
Army have met secretly and are likely to make an important policy
statement soon about the tensions troubling Northern Ireland's
peace accord, police in both parts of Ireland said Monday.
	   Senior police in Belfast and Dublin, speaking on condition they
not be identified, said anti-terrorist detectives tracked more than
50 IRA members, including the outlawed group's seven-member ruling
Army Council, to a secret location last weekend in County Cavan
near the Irish Republic's border with British-ruled Northern
Ireland.
	   But the two officers said they didn't know if the question of
disarmament _ so long an obstacle on Northern Ireland's slow road
to peace _ came up for serious debate.
	   All eight party leaders who backed the April peac deal are in
Boston and Washington this week to accept awards saluting that
achievement, but tensions among them have rarely run higher.
	   The agreement envisaged that Protestant and Catholic politicians
would form by October a multi-party administration for Northern
Ireland and agree terms for policy-making committees with the Irish
Republic. Neither step has been taken.
	   Protestant politician David Trimble, the would-be leader of that
administration, has insisted that Sinn Fein can't participate until
the IRA startS to disarm.
	   IRA leaders traditionally draft policy statements in December to
be issued for New Year's Day. Any significant policy changes, such
as cease-fires, require broader sanction from middle-ranking
personnel to minimize the risk of internal feuding.
	   Following previous secret meetings the IRA has rejected all
calls to disarm, although the accord said it and outlawed
pro-British paramilitary groups should destroy their hidden
arsenals by mid-2000.
	   On Monday, meanwhile, police arrested a suspected member of the
IRA dissident gang responsible for August's car-bomb attack on the
Northern Irish town of Omagh, which killed 29 people and wounded
370.
	   Police found a Kalashnikov rifle, a handgun, ammunition clips
and bomb-making equipment in the 42-year-old man's home in Dundalk,
a border town 50 miles (80 kms) south of Belfast. More than 40
previous suspects arrested in connection with the Omagh blast have
been released. None were caught with weaponry.
	   The dissidents _ dubbed the Real IRA by media because their
leaders refer to themselves as simply the IRA _ broke away in
protest at the parent organization's July 1997 truce, and opposed
April's accord on the grounds it recognized Northern Ireland's
right to exist as a separate state.
	   But the Real IRA called its own truce in September following
universal public uproar over the Omagh atrocity, the worst in the
30-year history of the conflict over Northern Ireland.

	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee vowed Monday to give no ground _ not ``even an inch'' _ of
Kashmir to Pakistan.
	   Vajpayee, addressing residents of a border area that has been
heavily damaged by Pakistani shells in the almost routine exchanges
of fire between India and Pakistan, accused the neighboring country
of having ``nefarious designs'' on Indian-held Kashmir, Press Trust
of India quoted him as saying.
	   He spoke in Tangdhar, 180 kilometers (110 miles) north of
Srinagar, capital of Indian-held Kashmir state and just five
kilometers (three miles) from the frontier India and Pakistan
dispute.
	   ``We will thwart all such attempts by our adversaries until the
last breath,'' he was quoted as saying. ``We will guard our borders
at all costs. We will not allow even an inch of our land to go
....''
	   Across the border, the top politician in Pakistan-held Kashmir,
Choudhry Sultan Mahmood, scoffed at Vajpayee's statement.
	   ``I hope that good sense will prevail and that the Indian
government will realize that it already has failed to hold on to
Kashmir,'' Mahmood told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview. ``They have ruined their reputation and have paid a
heavy price in blood and money.''
	   ``India has been giving the world the impression that Pakistan
is an Islamic fundamentalist state that doesn't want a solution,
but now with Vajpayee's statements the world will understand that
it is India that does not want a solution,'' Mahmood added.
	   Groups opposed to Indian rule in Kashmir shut down Srinagar for
the second day Monday in an anti-Vajpayee protest strike. Shops
were closed and only a few private cars defied the general strike
call on the last day of Vajpayee's two-day visit, his first to the
state since taking office earlier this year.
	   On Sunday, police said explosives hidden in a public toilet
shattered windows of houses and hotels less than three kilometers
two miles from the state governor's guest house where Vajpayee was
staying. The small explosion was a reminder militants can still
disrupt life in Srinagar, though the government has declared the
uprising largely subdued.
	   The militants say Muslim-majority Kashmir should not be part of
India, which is predominantly Hindu and officially secular. Several
groups are fighting Indian forces, with some demanding independence
and others union with officially Islamic Pakistan. More than 15,000
people have been killed in the fighting in the last nine years.
	   India accuses Pakistan of arming and training the militants, but
Pakistan says it lends them only moral support. The two countries
have fought two wars over the Himalayan territory in the past 51
years and still regularly skirmish across the Kashmir border. India
controls two-thirds of Kashmir and Pakistan the rest; both
countries claim all of Kashmir.
	   Since India and Pakistan exploded underground nuclear devices in
May and declared themselves nuclear powers, the international
community has recognized the disputed region as a possible nuclear
flash point.

Yeltsin's new chief of staff criticizes high-level corruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Russia-Yeltsin &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After his unexpected appointment Monday, Boris
Yeltsin's new chief of staff said he would focus on rooting out
corruption, calling it a problem up to the ``upper echelons.''
	   Yeltsin named Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, formerly head of Russia's
Border Guards, his chief of staff after firing several aides in a
rare Kremlin appearance Monday. Yeltsin then returned to the
hospital where he is recuperating from pneumonia.
	   Bordyuzha said fighting crime and corruption would be one of his
key goals.
	   ``Fighting corruption is very important today, including in the
upper echelons of power,'' he said in an interview with Russia's
NTV television.
	   He also said, ``We should ... make sure that all decisions made
at the highest levels are implemented unswervingly and promptly,
without any discussion.''
	   Bordyuzha, 49, is also secretary of the presidential security
council, a job he will keep along with his new post.

Most seats for St. Petersburg elections go to runoffs

 &UR; By DMITRY LOVETSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Most local legislative seats up
for grabs in Russia's second largest city of St. Petersburg will go
to runoffs after an election that was marred by bomb threats and
complaints of voter fraud.
	   Officials said Monday that just six of 50 seats were decided in
Sunday's election for the St. Petersburg legislative assembly,
while the rest will go to runoffs scheduled for December 20.
	   The six seats were all held by incumbent assembly deputies.
Candidates must get more than 50 percent of the vote to win in the
first round, or the top two vote winners face each other in a
second round.
	   Liberals took a prominent lead in the first round of voting,
with 22 members of the liberal Yabloko party and nine people from
other reform-minded parties still in the race.
	   Ten communists, as well as the city's former police chief, a
movie actress and the author of a tell-all book about the former
mayor of St. Petersburg are also still in the running.
	   Observers were eager to see how the elections would reflect
public reaction to rising crime in St. Petersburg, including the
Nov. 20 killing of Galina Starovoitova, a member of the Russian
parliament who supported a liberal bloc of candidates in the
elections.
	   Starovoitova supporters speculated she was killed so that her
faction, Northern Capital, would fare poorly in the election. Her
death, however, may have had the opposite effect, rallying liberal
voters.
	   In addition, hitmen have killed a legislative aide, a
high-ranking city official and a prominent banker in St. Petersburg
in the last two months.
	   Dirty politics in St. Petersburg were reflected in the
elections, which were marred by violence, racial slurs against
Jewish candidates and complaints of ballot box stuffing.
	   The City Electoral Commission also reported complaints of voter
bribery, and bomb threats forced the temporary closure of three
stations.
	   Still, voter turnout was high by Russian standards _ around 40
percent.
	   The city's governor, Vladimir Yakovlev, on Monday praised the
turnout and the elections.
	   He also added: ``The talk that St. Petersburg is the hub of the
underworld must stop,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Yakovlev's critics said his supporters contributed to the
mean-spirited atmosphere surrounding the election. Yakovlev's
opponents found that people with names identical to theirs
mysteriously wound up on the ballot in an apparent attempt to
confuse voters and take away votes from liberals.

Kosovo Albanian negotiator: U.S. plan totally unacceptable
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Efforts to forge a political
solution for Kosovo appeared stalemated Monday after the chief
ethnic Albanian negotiator rejected the latest American plan for
the troubled province.
	   Fehmi Agani said the new U.S. formula for the future of the
majority Albanian province was too close to the views of Serbia.
Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Most ethnic Albanians want independence or substantial
self-rule, whereas Serbia, in its proposal for Kosovo released last
month, has offered only a degree of autonomy while keeping the
province firmly under Serbian control.
	   Speaking to reporters in the provincial capital, Pristina, Agani
dismissed the latest American draft as ``unacceptable'' and said it
could not be ``considered a basis for ... future negotiations.''
	   The United States is leading diplomatic efforts to hammer out a
solution that is acceptable to both ethnic Albanians and the
Serbian regime.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman David Leavy said the
Clinton administration would keep working on a formula to assure
peace and stability in Kosovo and a return to the kind of autonomy
the province had until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
canceled it a decade ago.
	   ``We are determined to push for a political settlement that will
bring autonomy to Kosovo,'' Leavy said.
	   But that formula may no longer satisfy ethnic Albanians.
Hundreds have been killed and almost 300,000 ethnic Albanians
displaced in a seven-month crackdown by Serbian forces against
Kosovo's separatists, before an October peace agreement brought
about a tentative truce.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, shuttling between Belgrade and
Kosovo, has so far presented four versions of a U.S. formula for
the province.
	   ``The new (American) draft is ... almost identical to the
Serbian'' plan, Agani told reporters.
	   He said the latest American proposal accepts Serbia's main
demand of having Kosovo remain a part of Serbia and substantially
within Serbia's legal system.
	   The previous U.S. draft left out a detailed formula for the
province's final status but ``envisaged... independent institutions
in Kosovo,'' Agani said. He said the earlier draft ``although far
from (ethnic Albanian) demands,'' had at least ``opened up
perspective.''
	   The latest changes in the American draft were
``incomprehensible,'' he said, adding that the ethnic Albanian team
would soon come up with its own proposal for Kosovo.
	   The changes the ethnic Albanian side objected to most revolved
around Kosovo's future parliament which, according to the latest
American draft, would not be able to pass laws.
	   Also, the draft did not foresee Kosovo having a separate
government.
	   The latest version of Hill's plan has not been studied by the
Serbian government, said Ivan Sedlak, an official on the Serbian
negotiating team.
	   He said the previous U.S. version was unacceptable because it
defined Kosovo virtually as a separate state.
	   Although a de-facto cease-fire generated by the October accord
has reduced bloodshed, there are fears that Kosovo will again
explode in fierce fighting unless a political solution is found by
spring.

U.N. chief says `positive progress' in Lockerbie case

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Monday there has been ``positive progress'' in
resolving the dispute with Libya over the Lockerbie bombing.
	   But he said it was too early to predict when Tripoli might agree
to the trial of two Libyans wanted in connection with the 1988
bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270
people.
	   Kofi made the comments at a news conference after addressing the
opening of a summit by leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council. The
GCC groups Gulf Arab states in a confederation for economic and
political cooperation.
	   ``We made positive progress,'' Annan said of his weekend meeting
with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. ``We're on our way to resolving
the issue.''
	   He added: ``It will take time, but (we) hope not a lot of
time.''
	   Asked when Libya might respond to the U.S.-British offer for a
trial of the suspects in the Netherlands, Annan said: ``I can't
give a precise date. They understand the reality. It is up to them
to make an announcement.''
	   He noted, however, that Libyan Foreign Minister Omar
al-Muntasser has said a decision won't take long.
	   The Libyan People's Congress, or parliament, was scheduled to
meet Tuesday to discuss the Lockerbie case.
	   Annan met al-Muntasser in the northern Libyan city of Sirte on
Saturday before being driven into the desert for a meeting with
Gadhafi.
	   Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a joint
U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects before a panel of
Scottish judges in the Netherlands.
	   Libya _ which had resisted any attempts to extradite Abdel
Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah on grounds they
couldn't get a fair trial in the West _ has accepted the
U.S.-British offer in principle.
	   But the Libyans have expressed concerns for the suspects'
security in the Netherlands, saying they feared they could be
kidnapped and taken to the United States. They also have asked that
if convicted, the men serve their sentences in Libya.
	   Earlier, Esmat Abdel-Meguid, secretary-general of the Arab
League said he expects a positive response from Libya on the
proposed trial in the Netherlands.
	   He said Annan told him earlier Monday that the Libyans still
wanted some issues clarified. He did not say what they were.
	   He said the league, headquartered in Cairo, Egypt, was ``ready
to cooperate to find a solution.''
	   In Abu Dhabi Monday, Annan also met with South African President
Nelson Mandela and Azzedine Laraki, secretary-general of the
Saudi-headquartered Organization of the Islamic Conference, who are
both attending the summit.
	   Mandela and Annan are the first leaders outside the group to
attend the annual GCC summit, which first met in 1981.

Kosovo Albanian negotiator: U.S. plan unacceptable

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Efforts to forge a political
solution for Kosovo appeared stalemated on Monday after the chief
ethnic Albanian negotiator rejected the latest American plan for
the troubled province.
	   Fehmi Agani said the new U.S. draft for a political settlement
in the majority Albanian province was too close to the views of
Serbia. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   Most ethnic Albanians, however, want independence or substantial
self-rule.
	   Speaking to reporters in the provincial capital Pristina, Agani
blasted the American draft as ``unacceptable'' and said it could
not be ``considered a basis for ... future negotiations.''
	   The United States is leading diplomatic efforts to hammer out a
solution which would be acceptable both to independence-seeking
ethnic Albanians and to the Serbian regime which wants to keep
control over Kosovo.
	   In Washington, a White House spokesman, David Leavy, said
America would keep working on a formula to assure peace and
stability in Kosovo and a return to the kind of autonomy the
province had until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic canceled
it a decade ago.
	   ``We are determined to push for a political settlement that will
bring autonomy to Kosovo,'' Leavy told a reporter.
	   But that formula may no longer satisfy ethnic Albanian
politicians. Hundreds have been killed and almost 300,000 ethnic
Albanians displaced in a seven-month crackdown by Serbian forces
against Kosovo's separatists, before an October peace agreement
brought about a tentative truce.
	   American envoy Christopher Hill, shuttling between Belgrade and
Kosovo, has so far presented four versions of a U.S. formula for
the future of the province.
	   ``The new (American) draft is ... almost identical to the
Serbian'' plan, Agani told reporters.
	   Serbia last month released its own proposal for Kosovo under
which the province would be given a degree of autonomy but would
remain under Serbian control.
	   According to Agani, the latest American version accepted the
major Serb demand to have Kosovo remain within Yugoslavia as part
of Serbia and substantially within Serbia's legal system.
	   The changes to which the ethnic Albanian side objected most
revolved around Kosovo's future parliament which, according to the
latest American draft, would not be able to pass laws.
	   Also, the draft did not foresee Kosovo as having a separate
government.
	   This latest version of Hill's plan has not been studied by the
Serbian government, Ivan Sedlak, an official in the Serbian team
for Kosovo talks, said.

Gulf leaders to focus on oil at annual summit

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Six Arab Gulf leaders
opened an annual summit Monday that was expected to focus on
falling oil prices, which have hit their economies hard.
	   Shortly before the meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council
began, January futures contracts for Brent crude _ a widely watched
benchmark _ fell to a record low of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on the
International Petroleum Exchange in London.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent.
	   The Gulf oil producers, who control about half of global oil
reserves, have been hard hit by the oil market crisis, which has
been blamed on the recession in Asia and warmer-than-usual winters.
Oil exports account for some 75 percent of their revenues.
	   For the first time, the GCC summit is being attended by leaders
outside the group, including U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
South African President Nelson Mandela.
	   Both told the opening session of the three-day summit that they
hoped the Wye River agreement, brokered by U.S. President Bill
Clinton between Israel and the Palestinians, would lead to peace in
the Middle East.
	   Annan made no mention in his speech of his talks with Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi, whom he met Saturday in Libya to try and
arrange the trial of two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a
Pan Am jet. The bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, killed 270
people.
	   But he later told a news conference here: ``We made positive
progress. We're on our way to resolving the issue.''
	   He added: ``It will take time, but (we) hope not a lot of
time.''

EU pushes ahead with defense plan, with Britain on board

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Given new impetus by Britain's support,
European Union nations pushed forward Monday with plans to develop
a joint-defense capability that would reduce their military
dependence on the United States.
	   EU foreign ministers considered proposals for European nations
to build up military hardware and create new institutional
arrangements that would empower the 15-nation bloc to tackle
trouble-spots on its doorstep.
	   ``We are discussing how we project military capacity in defense
of our own security,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told
reporters. ``There may be occasion when we want to take part in a
peacekeeping operation or a crisis-management operation where the
Americans don't.''
	   British officials said the next step would be an ``audit'' of
Europe's armed forces to see where action was most needed to
correct weaknesses. They said the lack of large transport aircraft
to rush troops and equipment to flash-points was an obvious
example. Such a review was expected to be concluded in the first
half of 1999.
	   France has long led efforts to give Europe an independent
defense, but British reluctance to endorse initiatives that were
seen as weakening NATO prevented progress.
	   In a recent shift, British Prime Minister Tony Blair believes
the EU nations can work together within the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization as a strengthened ``European pillar,''
shoulder-to-shoulder with the United States.
	   Washington has welcomed that as a move by the Europeans to take
a greater share of the defense burden and reduce the need for U.S.
soldiers to get involved in crises such as those in Bosnia and
Kosovo.
	   To streamline decisionmaking, officials at Monday's EU meeting
said they were considering scrapping the Western European Union
defense group set up in 1950 and instead give EU foreign and
defense ministers new powers to decide security issues.
	   ``Ways of resolving the question include the dissolution of the
Western European Union,'' Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes
told reporters.
	   The European defense debate is likely to be continued at the
EU's summit of government leaders in Vienna, Austria, on Friday and
Saturday, and at a meeting Tuesday of NATO foreign ministers in
Brussels.
	   Austria's Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, whose country
currently holds the EU's rotating presidency, is scheduled to
discuss the issue Tuesday with NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana.
	   The defense moves present particular problems for the EU's four
neutral members, Austria, Sweden, Ireland and Finland. Officials
said a system was being considered to enable them to opt-out of the
defense arrangements.

Court convicts 47 defendants in Sicilian Mafia trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CATANIA, Sicily (AP) _ In the latest crackdown on mobsters, a
court here convicted 47 defendants of crimes ranging from murder to
extortion to money laundering.
	   Five defendants were acquitted. Italy's stiffest penalty, life
imprisonment, was handed down to five mobsters for various
homicides.
	   Two turncoats, a man and his nephew, were given lesser
sentences, 20 and 16 years respectively, for a pair of murders and
for extortion because they had joined the growing army of mobsters
who have collaborated with the state.
	   During the trial, some Catania business owners who earlier had
told investigators that they were victims of extortion took back
the accusations when asked to confirm their testimony in front of
the defendants.
	   Prosecutors described the defendants as members of Mafia crime
clans from the Catania area.

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Bedouins on Monday kidnapped four German
tourists, three of them women, according to tribal leaders and
German diplomats.
	   Three gunman of the Bani Dhabyan tribe forced the tourists into
their truck on the main road between San`a and the Dhamar province,
about 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of the capital, the tribesmen
and diplomats said.
	   The tourists were taken to Serwah, in the province of Marib, 170
kilometers (105 miles) northeast of the capital, they said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Yemen authorities have asked members of another tribe to
negotiate the release of the tourists. The demands of the Bedouin
kidnappers were not immediately known.
	   The Germans apparently were on their way back to San`a after a
trip through central Yemen when they were kidnapped.
	   The Bani Dhabyan tribe has carried out numerous kidnappings,
including the seizure in April of a British teacher, David
Mitchell, his wife and their 14-year old son.
	   The tribe roams areas around San`a and Marib.
	   Armed tribesmen, who control large parts of Yemen, frequently
kidnap foreigners to try to win concessions from the government in
exchange for their release. The hostages are usually well treated
and released unharmed.

Jobless occupy unemployed offices in Marseille
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A group of jobless occupied unemployment offices in
the southern port of Marseille on Monday, demanding a year-end
bonus of 3,000 francs (dlrs 535).
	   The jobless protest for the time being is limited to the
Marseille region, but jobless activists have threatened similar
actions in other French cities, including Bordeaux and Perpignan.
	   The movement is similar to one that took place in France last
December, with unemployed workers demanding a bonus in order to be
able to celebrate the Christmas and New Year holidays.
	   Last year's protests prompted Socialist Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin's government to come up with a fund worth one billion francs
(dlrs 178 million) to help the needy.
	   Jobless activists say 15 billion francs is needed to help the
jobless this year.
	   The jobless protesters were quickly evacuated Monday from the
unemployment offices.

Embattled Netanyahu government faces showdown in parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with vote delayed, details, ADDS photo tag &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo JRL117
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Facing possible defeat over a bill calling for
early elections, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
maneuvered his way out of a showdown Monday that might have ended
his term at Israel's helm.
	   With a majority of legislators poised to vote in favor of the
bill during the first of three readings scheduled Monday, Netanyahu
engineered a motion of no confidence in his own government, a move
which delays the vote for at least a week.
	   The bill is considered an indicator of parliamentary
dissatisfaction with Netanyahu and it highlighted the premier's
struggles to hold together his crumbling coalition over the latest
Mideast land-for-peace agreement Israel signed with the
Palestinians against the wishes of the majority of his coalition
members.
	   To buy time while he held marathon negotiations with hard-line
coalition members earlier, Netanyahu sent Deputy Minister Michael
Eitan to the Knesset floor to start a filibuster. Eitan once set an
Israeli record for filibusters, remaining on the podium for 11
hours.
	   Taking his own turn at the lectern after the house agreed to
turn the vote into a motion of no-confidence, Netanyahu battled
catcalls and interruptions from the opposition while explaining the
compromise and defending his policies.
	   The sharpest attack delivered on the premier came from David
Levy, the former foreign minister who bolted the government in
January and briefly considered returning recently to help stabilize
Netanyahu's coalition.
	   Levy accused Netanyahu of breaking agreements and publicly
embarrassing him.
	   A preliminary reading in August passed and the bill would need
to pass three additional readings before the parliament was
dissolved and new elections were called.
	   Netanyahu has been embroiled in political crisis since he signed
the accord in October to cede more West Bank land to the
Palestinians against the wishes of a majority of his coalition
members.
	   The latest turmoil comes less than a week before U.S. President
Bill Clinton is to arrive, to preside over the next phase of the
accord. However Netanyahu has frozen further troop withdrawals
saying the Palestinians have violated the accord.
	   In suspending progress however, Netanyahu lost the safety net in
parliament the dovish labor party guaranteed it would provide in
order to ensure the government remained in power as long as it was
implementing the accord.
	   Labor party leader Ehud Barak said a vote to bring down the
Netanyahu government would not halt the peace process.
	   Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi argued that if Netanyahu is not
given a majority to implement the withdrawals, ``the peace process
will have to wait until the new elections,'' he told The Associated
Press.
	   The Israeli parliament was also due to consider changing the
country's electoral system back to the previous method. Netanyahu
is Israel's first directly-elected prime minister. Israelis cast
two ballots in 1996, one for prime minister and one for a party to
be represented in the parliament, instead of a single ballot for a
party as in the past.
	   Authors of the bill withdrew it at the last moment, fearing that
it would not get the support of an absolute majority of members as
required for passage.
	   Analysts say the new system has destroyed the power base of the
two main Israeli parties, Netanyahu's Likud and Barak's Labor,
opening the door to dozens of small single interest parties that
wield a disproportionate amount of power in coalition governing.

Katja Seizinger writes off season, faced with career end
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Katja Seizinger, the dominant women's
skier last season, refused to end speculation Monday that her
career may be ended because of a severe knee injury.
	   Seizinger announced she won't compete this season because
recovery from the June 24 injury, which included torn tendons, has
been slower than expected.
	   ``The decision didn't come easy, but the season is over for
me,'' said Seizinger, a three-time Olympic gold medalist.
	   The German, last year's overall World Cup champion, didn't say
when she can return to competition or whether she will.
	   ``I can't answer that question right now _ but my health is more
important,'' said Seizinger.
	   Wolfgang Maier, head coach of the German ski team, also said
Monday the 26-year-old told him she wasn't certain about resuming
her career.
	   ``She told me she's leaving it open,'' Maier said.
	   Seizinger had occasionally publicly talked bout retiring in the
near future even before the knee injury and torn tendons suffered
during training at Schnalstal in Italy.
	   Seizinger, 26, had hoped to be back on the slopes in
mid-December and make her comeback by the World Championships on
Feb. 1 in Vail, Colorado.
	   ``There's not enough time now _ the theme world championships
has been written off,'' said Seizinger.
	   Seizinger swept nine of her career 36 World Cup races en route
to her second overall title last season. She then capped her year
by winning Olympic gold in the downhill and combination.
	   ``My first thought after my injury was, you really should have
quit after Nagano,'' Seizinger said.
	   Seizinger, a student, had in the past said she didn't plan to
compete at the 2002 Winter Games.
	   ``Vail would be a good place to finish,'' she said at the time.

Annan calls on Emirates, Iran to resolve islands dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Gulf-Summit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Monday he had urged direct talks between Iran and
the United Arab Emirates to resolve a dispute over three Gulf
islands.
	   Annan, speaking at a news conference after the opening of a
summit of six Gulf Arab leaders, said he had made the suggestion
here to the Emirates president, Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.
He said he also telephoned Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi
in Tehran.
	   ``I proposed to his highness Sheik Zayed that it would be
helpful if his country got together with Iran for talks on the
islands issue,'' Annan said.
	   ``I also spoke to the Iranian foreign minister and urged him to
engage the Emirates as quick as he can,'' Annan added. ``His
response was positive.''
	   Iran annexed the three Gulf islands _ Abu Musa and the Greater
and Lesser Tunbs _ in 1992. The strategic islands, also claimed by
the Emirates, have been a stumbling block in relations between Iran
and the Gulf Cooperation Council.
	   The political, economic and defense alliance groups Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and the Emirates.
	   Iran has insisted on direct talks to resolve the dispute, but
the Emirates has called for international arbitration.

Skinheads sentenced for attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A Polish court on Monday sentenced four
nationalist skinheads to prison terms ranging from two to 25 years
for attacks that killed three people and injured another.
	   The skinheads, all aged 20, were members of a small extreme
nationalist party called The Polish National Front.
	   Two of them, identified only as Arkadiusz J. and Grzegorz S.,
were convicted of murdering a homeless man in August 1995. They
received 25-year prison terms, the longest available for under-age
defendants. Both were 17 at the time of the crime.
	   A third man, identified as Arkadiusz L., got a 15-year term for
beating up a man who later died of his injuries. Another defendant,
Robert W., received a two-year suspended sentence for taking part
in an attack on a Zimbabwean in Poland.
	   According to evidence at the trial, the group targeted homeless
and drunken men because their party encouraged them to rid the
country of ``unworthy'' people.
	   All attacks took place in the town of Legionowo, some 25
kilometers (15 miles) north of Warsaw.
	   Judge Piotr Janiszewski said the aggression was ``their own
choice, a tragic, false and bad choice for which they have to
account.''
	   Poland has relatively few ethnic and racial minorities compared
to other European countries, with more than 90 percent of the
population being white Roman Catholics.
	   Since the end of decades of communist rule in 1989, violence
involving nationalist groups has increased as Poland has undergone
economic transformation that brought high unemployment and other
hardships to people used to guaranteed jobs of the state-controlled
socialist system.

Radical group angry at Clinton's visit but makes no threats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinian, US-Israel &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Islamic group Hamas on Monday
denounced President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit to the Gaza Strip
but made no threats against him.
	   Hamas opposes peace with Israel and the U.S.-brokered
land-for-security accord signed six weeks ago.
	   Spokesman Mahmoud Zahar said the group does not welcome Clinton,
who is due in Gaza next Monday. ``He brings nothing for us, or for
any Palestinians ... He is a 100 percent supporter of Israel.''
	   While Hamas opposes the visit, in an interview with The
Associated Press Zahar said the group planned no attacks.
	   ``From our side, we won't do anything. We don't believe any
aggression against this (visit) will serve our purposes,'' he said.
``We will leave him to practice his tricks.''
	   However, Hamas' political wing, of which Zahar is a senior
leader, customarily denies having prior knowledge of attacks by the
group's military arm, the Izzedine al Qassam brigades.
	   Zahar harshly criticized the U.S. stance on an escalating
Israeli-Palestinian quarrel over the release of Palestinian
prisoners by Israel.
	   Palestinians are furious that most of those freed so far have
been common criminals rather than people jailed for anti-Israel
activity. The dispute has triggered Palestinian street riots that
have left dozens hurt, and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners are on
a hunger strike.
	   Last week Washington said Israel was living up to its
commitments on the prisoners.
	   ``How are we to listen to this?'' Zahar said angrily.
	   Hamas has been the target of a crackdown by Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority since Oct. 29, when it tried to blow up a
school bus. The attack killed an Israeli soldier whose jeep was
escorting the bus.
	   In response, Arafat put the group's spiritual leader, Sheik
Ahmed Yassin, under house arrest. Hundreds of Hamas activists were
jailed, including several senior leaders.
	   Palestinian sources say more Hamas activists will be rounded up
ahead of Clinton's arrival. Zahar, who was freed recently after
several weeks in prison, said it would be ``shameful'' for Arafat
to act against Hamas in connection with the Clinton visit.
	   Asked how Hamas would respond, he said only: ``We are going to
intensify our relationship with God.''

Le Pen loyalist rebels as National Front rivalry bursts into open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS; UPDATES with second firing; ADDS detail.
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In the latest and clearest sign of serious trouble
in the far-right National Front, one of party leader Jean-Marie Le
Pen's loyalists openly defied him on Monday _ and was immediately
fired.
	   The episode, along with a second firing of a Front member who
spoke out against Le Pen, provided further evidence that the
flamboyant leader is losing his grip on the party he has led for a
quarter-century.
	   It came after a tempestuous weekend in which the rivalry between
Le Pen and longtime lieutenant Bruno Megret burst suddenly and
perhaps irrevocably onto the surface.
	   The National Front is virulently anti-immigrant, and has been
widely accused of racism and anti-Semitism.
	   For 27 years, Le Pen has been the movement's absolute leader.
But his increasingly public clashes with the quieter, more
pragmatic Megret have deeply divided the party.
	   On Monday, moments after a news conference in which a longtime
Le Pen loyalist, Serge Martinez, harshly criticized recent actions
by Le Pen, the party leader issued a terse statement.
	   Serge Martinez is ``removed from all his political and
administrative functions with the National Front,'' it said.
	   He also fired Pierre Vial, another member of the party's
political bureau who had questioned Le Pen's recent actions.
	   Martinez, until late Monday the Front's head of personnel and a
member of its 43-member political bureau, had announced at his news
conference: ``The unity of our movement is gravely threatened.''
	   Without taking Megret's side, Martinez denounced what he called
the ``purges'' being led by Le Pen, with his
``anything-but-Megret'' attitude.
	   He called for an urgent congress of all the party's 50,000 or so
members. ``We must protect the National Front from the explosion
that threatens it,'' he said.
	   He refused to say whether that meant calling Le Pen's leadership
into question _ although that was the clear implication.
	   The worst moment, Martinez said Monday, came last week when, as
personnel director, he was forced to fire two Megret loyalists,
ostensibly for economic reasons.
	   Le Pen ``can no longer count on me for that kind of task,''
Martinez said.
	   Le Pen and Megret first clashed publicly over Megret's strategy
of making alliances with the traditional right.
	   Things got uglier this summer when Le Pen, threatened with a
legal ban on running for office, proposed that his wife _ not
Megret _ replace him at the top of the party list for upcoming
European Parliament elections.
	   On Saturday, at a noisy party meeting, Le Pen ejected two of
Megret's backers: Hubert Fayard and Nathalie Debaille, the same two
who'd been fired a few days earlier.
	   On Sunday night, he blamed the problems on ``a few people from
an extremist and even racist minority.''
	   If Megret ``thinks my position represents a sort of betrayal,''
Le Pen continued, ``I think he has no business in the movement I
preside over.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian police opened fire Monday on
rioters protesting Israel's refusal to release Palestinian
prisoners _ the first sign that the Palestinian police were
containing violence in advance of President Bill Clinton's visit
this week.
	   In the West Bank city of Nablus, Palestinian police took to the
rooftops and fired onto a crowd of some 3,000 Palestinians, mostly
bystanders who had gathered to watch the rioting. Witnesses said at
least five people were wounded and taken away to hospitals.
	   A Jewish settler driving near the city of Jenin, also in the
northern West Bank, was shot and wounded from gunfire towards his
car, the Israeli army said. The settler, a resident of the nearby
settlement of Ganim, managed to drive to an Israeli army outpost
several kilometers (miles) away and was taken from there to a
hospital in Afula, Israel.
	   The shooting at a settler was the first since the Israeli army
withdrew from that area last month as part of the Mideast
land-for-peace accord and left Ganim and several other settlements
isolated and surrounded by Palestinian-controlled areas.

Angry French farmers block highway leading to Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHAMBERY, France (AP) _ About 150 angry French farmers demanding
subsidies for rural agriculture in the Alps blocked a highway on
Monday cutting access to a tunnel linking France and Italy.
	   About 100 truckers seeking to enter France from Italy were stuck
Monday evening in the Maurienne Valley.
	   The farmers used about 10 tractors to block the RN6 highway,
preventing any traffic from using the road and also managed to
penetrate the A43 highway using bales of hay to impede traffic.
	   The farmers say that they are threatened by reforms in European
Union that would reduce their subsidies and need extra help from
the French government.
	   Some 3,600 vehicles used the Frejus tunnel between France and
Italy, which is now blocked.

Diamondbacks reach agreement with ex-Padre center fielder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BOB BAUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Center fielder Steve Finley became the sixth free
agent to sign with the Arizona Diamondbacks in the last month,
agreeing Monday to a dlrs 20 million, four-year contract.
	   Diamondbacks' managing general partner Jerry Colangelo confirmed
the deal had been completed and the team scheduled a news
conference to introduce Finley.
	   Arizona's deal far exceeded the three-year, dlrs 12 million
offer Finley had to remain with the San Diego Padres.
	   Finley said last week that his signing with the Diamondbacks was
a foregone conclusion.
	   ``Arizona wanted me over there real bad,'' he said. ``I think
San Diego wanted me here, but they wanted me under their terms. It
was unfortunate that it's the way it happened, but the game's a
business.''
	   Colangelo has spent dlrs 117.4 million in recent weeks in an
attempt to turn the Diamondbacks into a contender in a hurry. Most
of the money went for pitching.
	   Randy Johnson agreed to a dlrs 52.4 million, four-year deal,
Todd Stottlemyre agreed to dlrs 32 million for year years, Armando
Reynoso got dlrs 5.5 million for two years and reliever Greg
Swindell received dlrs 5.7 million over three years.
	   Arizona also picked up pinch-hit specialist Greg Colbrunn for
dlrs 1.8 million over two years.
	   Center field was a top priority because Devon White, Arizona's
MVP last season, agreed to a dlrs 12 million, three-year contract
with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
	   That left the crucial defensive spot to Dante Powell, a young,
light-hitting player with little major league experience. Powell
was obtained in a trade that sent reliever Alan Embree to San
Francisco.
	   Finley hit a career-low .249 this year with 14 homers and 67
RBIs, two years after setting career highs in batting average
(.297), doubles (45), home runs (30) and RBIs (95) and winning his
second straight Gold Glove.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After nearly two decades of separation, an
Israeli father was reunited with his son, a U.S. Marine on military
maneuvers in Israel's southern Negev Desert.
	   The father, Dr. David Ben-Menachem said Monday the two were
separated when his estranged wife Jennifer left Israel for Jamaica
and then Florida almost twenty years ago with their son Yossi and
two daughters.
	   Ben-Menachem said that his efforts to remain in contact with his
children were rebuffed by his former wife's family and he had since
given up hope of reunion.
	   Israeli journalists at the training exercises noticed the
19-year-old Marine speaking in Hebrew and when they approached him,
Levitt said he wanted to meet his father who he had last seen as a
young boy.
	   The Yediot Ahronot newspaper printed Levitt's photo on Friday
and the two were reunited at Levitt's training base Sunday.
	   ``We talked about the past and will keep in contact in the
future,'' Levitt told Channel Two.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz said Levitt would be given
special leave at the end of the maneuvers to spend time with his
father.
	   Schwartz said the exercises were routine under U.S.-Israel
security agreements, adding that Israel was one of the few
countries in the region that allowed U.S. Marines to train on its
soil.
	   Schwartz said the fleet would return to sea before U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to the region from Saturday.

Italy and Germany Monday for a court in a neutral nation to try
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan who remains under police guard
in Rome following his Nov. 15 arrest.
	   EU foreign ministers issued a statement denouncing international
terrorism and Ocalan's outlawed Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK. They
also backed Italy for not extraditing Ocalan to Turkey where he
could face the death penalty.
	   Germany, which has issued a warrant for Ocalan's arrest, has
ruled out seeking his extradition for fear of stirring unrest among
the nation's Turkish population of 2 million, one-fifth of which
are Kurds.
	   Instead, Italy and Germany want an international tribunal to try
him. That view was endorsed by the other 13 EU nations, but there
is no international court with an clear mandate to take the case.
	   ``This is not a problem for two, or three countries, but for the
whole of Europe,'' Italian Foreign Ministers Lamberto Dini told
reporters.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said ministers agreed the
Council of Europe, a 40-nation organization that promotes democracy
and human rights, should be asked to look for a solution. The
council has a 1972 protocol allowing for the transfer of trials
from one member nation to another.
	   The PKK has fought a 14-year war for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey,
in which about 37,000 people have been killed. Ocalan faces murder
and terror charges in Turkey.

Judge has three choices on Tyson probation report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVE HERMAN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ The judge who sentenced Mike Tyson to prison
for rape has three options regarding the former heavyweight
champion's probation _ and one of them is returning him to jail.
	   Tyson pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault charges in
Maryland last week, and that could be used as evidence by Judge
Patricia Gifford of a possible parole violation.
	   ``There are three things that could occur when the report is
received,'' Gifford said Monday. ``A warrant for Mr. Tyson's arrest
could be issued, a hearing on the report could be scheduled, or
there could be no action toward a possible revocation of probation
... taken until sentencing in Maryland.
	   ``Until I've reviewed the report and made a decision, it would
be inappropriate to comment on possible action,'' the judge said.
	   Sentencing is Maryland is expected early next year. The
Montgomery County (Maryland) District Court said no exact
sentencing date has been set.
	   Probation officer George Walker said Thursday it appeared Tyson
violated terms of his probation as a result of his no-contest plea.
	   Tyson was released from prison in 1995. Gifford added four years
of probation, however, meaning Tyson could be sent back to jail for
any further violation. His probation is scheduled to expire in
March.
	   Tyson's no-contest plea stemmed from a minor traffic accident in
August in which two motorists claimed the boxer kicked and punched
them.
	   Indiana authorities also reviewed the probation _ but took no
action _ after Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's ears during a title
bout in June 1997. The Nevada Athletic Commission stripped Tyson of
his boxing license but reinstated him in October.
	   Tyson plans to fight Francois Botha on Jan. 16 in Las Vegas. A
news conference is scheduled Tuesday in Los Angeles to announce the
bout.
	   The no-contest plea was not an admission of guilt. However,
Tyson could face up to 20 years in prison _ 10 years on each count
_ and be fined up to dlrs 5,000. The two men he scuffled with
already have agreed to a settlement to avoid a civil suit.
	   Tyson is training in the Phoenix area and intends to live there.
He already has registered as a sex offender in Arizona as part of
his planned move.
	   His Arizona neighbors will not be notified when he chooses a
permanent home. The community notification law did not take effect
until after his conviction.
	   To clear the way for his move, Tyson is selling his 62-acre
estate in Ohio along with homes in Las Vegas and Connecticut, The
Plain Dealer of Cleveland reports. The total asking price is dlrs
21 million.

	   On Thursday, the master alarm blared and red lights flashed just
before the shuttle was to lift off. By the time controllers traced
the problem to a momentary drop in hydraulic pressure and decided
to press ahead, it was too late _ they had missed the cutoff by a
second or two.
	   ``Sure, it's frustrating,'' said Bill Readdy, shuttle program
director and a veteran shuttle commander. ``But we do things right.
We do things by the book, and we're not going to cut any corners
even if it means just shaving a second or two.''
	   The six astronauts crawled out of the shuttle, and two threw up
their hands. Cabana held up his thumb and index finger a half-inch
apart: ``We were that close.''
	   The problem was confined to one of Endeavour's three hydraulic
pressure units. The pressure dropped just long enough to trigger
the alarm, evidently because of a sensitive switch, then returned
to normal. NASA engineers spent the day examining the problem, but
found nothing wrong with any of the systems and were confident it
would not reoccur.
	   Endeavour's 12-day flight is already a year late because of a
cash crunch in Russia, one of NASA's partners in building the
international space station. The one-day delay cost NASA about
$600,000, mostly in fuel and overtime pay.
	   Aboard Endeavour is an American-made connecting passageway named
Unity. The astronauts will use the shuttle robot arm to capture the
Russian space station piece and attach it to Unity. Then, two
spacewalkers will hook up all the electrical connections and cables
between the two cylinders, and attach handrails and tools for
future crews.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other dignitaries from
around the world gathered again to see Endeavour and its crew off.
	   ``Here we have 16 countries cooperating on a venture to the
future,'' said Albright. ``This is a good investment.''

Five Americans, one Russian on first construction mission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AM-PM-Space Station &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Five Americans and one Russian are on NASA's first
station-construction flight. A brief look at each:
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Commander Robert Cabana has wanted to help build a space station
ever since he joined NASA in 1985.
	   NASA's target date, back then, was 1992. ``This is a chance to
finally get started,'' he says.
	   Cabana, 49, a Minneapolis-born Marine colonel and former test
pilot, became captivated with flying at age 5. His family took him
to the Smithsonian to see the planes of the Wright brothers and
Charles Lindbergh, and ``it's something that just stuck with me.''
	   This is his fourth space flight. Between his third and fourth
missions, he served as chief of the astronaut corps.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Pilot Rick Sturckow gave up race car driving to become a pilot
and, ultimately, an astronaut.
	   The space rookie from Lakeside, Calif., drove a Camaro in
stock-car races throughout his home state before joining the
Marines in 1984. NASA tapped him 10 years later.
	   ``Yeah, I've jumped in a race car every once in a while just to
kind of get the blood pumping,'' says the 37-year-old major. ``We
still fly high-performance jets, the T-38s. It's not the greatest
thing in the world, but you know it's not the worst, either.
They're still enough to keep you awake.''
	   A veteran of Operation Desert Storm _ he flew 41 combat missions
_ Sturckow couldn't wait to see how the shuttle compared with an
F-18.
	   He's trained as a backup spacewalker in the rare event one of
the two designated spacewalkers becomes ill or is hurt.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Nancy Currie has what the crew considers to be the toughest job:
Using the shuttle robot arm to lash the two space station pieces
together.
	   She'll have to rely on a computerized vision system because the
two components are too big to see out the window. The task, she
says, makes her feel like ``the whole weight of the program'' is on
her shoulders. Her 11-year-old daughter's advice? ``Be careful out
there, Mom.''
	   Currie, 39, an Army lieutenant colonel with a Ph.D. in
industrial engineering, worked as a helicopter instructor pilot
before joining NASA in 1987 to work on the shuttle training
aircraft. NASA picked her as an astronaut in 1990; this is her
third spaceflight.
	   She is from Troy, Ohio.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Jerry Ross got honorary membership in the ironworkers' union
after he tested space station construction back in 1985. Now, he'll
do it for real.
	   As the crew's lead spacewalker, Ross will attach electrical
connectors and cables between the first two station parts. He says
the three spacewalks will be ``a heck of a lot more fun'' than his
steel mill and highway construction work back in his college days.
	   ``If you design the job right, it's easier work. If we don't,
then we pay for it in spades,'' says Ross, 50, an Air Force colonel
from Crown Point, Ind.
	   Ross will have seven spacewalks to his credit by flight's end,
making him NASA's most experienced spacewalker. He's also one of
NASA's most seasoned space fliers; this is his sixth mission since
becoming an astronaut in 1980.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   James Newman says being assigned as a spacewalking construction
worker earned him points with his father-in-law, a civil engineer.
	   ``He's glad to have a son-in-law who's in the construction
business,'' he says, emphasizing the last two words.
	   Newman, 42, a physicist and three-time space flier from San
Diego, has one spacewalk to his credit and will have three more by
flight's end. This is his third shuttle mission but his first with
children at home. He and his wife have a 2-year-old boy and
10-month-old girl, which made launch day tougher than ever.
	   ``I recognize the risk,'' he says, ``but this is what I have
wanted to do for a long, long time.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev is getting a sneak preview.
	   He's scheduled to move into the international space station in
early 2000. After that mission kept getting delayed _ the
five-month stint should have begun in May _ he was added to this
flight so the crew could benefit from his knowledge of Russian
station hardware.
	   Krikalev, 40, is the crew's most experienced spaceman. He flew
to Mir twice, spending a total of 15 months there in the late 1980s
and early 1990s. And in 1994, he became the first Russian to fly on
a NASA shuttle.
	   He says it will be sad to see Mir replaced by the international
space station.
	   ``But sometimes to build something, you need to replace old
things with new,'' he notes. ``Some old shoes could be very
convenient, but you need to change shoes from time to time.''

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Endeavour's astronauts overcame
their first hurdle Saturday in building the international space
station: hoisting the 25,000-pound Unity chamber from the shuttle
cargo bay with only an inch of clearance on either side.
	   An even tougher job awaits them Sunday, when they attempt to
pluck a much larger Russian station component from orbit and attach
it to Unity without a direct line of sight.
	   The six shuttle astronauts have been chasing the component named
Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) since they rocketed into orbit Friday.
They trailed the giant cylinder by 6,000 miles Saturday evening.
	   Astronaut Nancy Currie used Endeavour's 50-foot robot arm to
lift Unity, the first American-made piece of the international
space station. She moved the precious load slowly _ so slowly it
almost appeared at first to be motionless.
	   ``Beautiful and delicate work,'' radioed Mission Control.
	   Currie raised Unity about 13 feet before tilting it to an
upright position above a docking ring in the cargo bay. She lowered
the cylinder to within a few inches of the ring; then the pilots
fired Endeavour's thrusters and the shuttle moved up just enough
for the pieces to snap together. The entire process took two hours.
	   ``We've got Unity firmly attached to Endeavour,'' shuttle
commander Robert Cabana reported, ``and we're off to a great start
on building the international space station.''
	   Unity will serve as a connecting passageway once more modules
arrive over the next few years. It's 36 feet long and 15 feet in
diameter, and is composed of 50,000 mechanical parts, 216 fluid and
gas lines, and 121 electrical cables containing a mind-boggling six
miles of wiring.
	   It barely fit in Endeavour's cargo bay, widthwise; there was
only an inch to spare on either side, making Currie's job
especially difficult. The last thing she wanted to do was bump
Unity against the shuttle while lifting it from its horizontal
position and setting it upright in preparation for Sunday's
coupling with Zarya.
	   The jointed shuttle arm, which also will be used for handling
the 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, has never wielded such massive
objects before. The two station components are so big that Currie
won't be able to see where they meet by looking out the window;
she'll rely solely on a computerized vision system to line them up,
the first ``in-the-blind'' docking attempt of its kind.
	   ``It's not so much a case of how difficult it is,'' Currie
explained before the flight, ``just how careful we have to be and
how time-consuming it is.''
	   Zarya, launched Nov. 20 from Kazakstan, contains all the power
and propulsion systems needed for the fledgling space station.
Without Zarya, Unity would be a useless, empty can in orbit.
	   ``I think Sunrise is very appropriate and I think Unity is very
appropriate for the new station because it's a new beginning and
we're all bound together,'' shuttle commander Robert Cabana said
from orbit.
	   Unity cost $300 million, Zarya $240 million. The National
Aeronautics and Space Administration paid for both.
	   NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin wondered aloud after Friday's
launch whether the astronauts would pull everything off.
	   ``We've practiced with robots. We've practiced with the
shuttle,'' Goldin said. ``But now we're doing the real thing with
hardware that cost a quarter of a billion dollars. Will we pull it
off? I'm going to worry every day.''

	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ A Russian-flagged Italian survey ship
rescued 52 clandestine African immigrants from rough waters south
of Malta, but navy officials said Sunday there was little hope of
finding five missing people.
	   Authorities in Valletta, where the immigrants arrived Sunday,
said the immigrants had been aboard a rickety wooden boat for two
days without food or water.
	   Survivors told police and military officials that their voyage
of hope had begun in various African ports where they were picked
up a ship. But after some days, the crew put them in the wooden
craft and abandoned them, the officials said.
	   When crew aboard the ship that came to their aid told them they
would be taken aboard, the immigrants, too anxious to wait, jumped
into the waters about 90 miles south of Malta and started swimming
toward the Akademia Nicolas Starakov, which then plucked them up.
	   The would-be immigrants were apparently hoping originally to
reach Sicily, reports indicated.
	   Thousands of people try to slip into Italy illegally to seek
work or families in Western Europe. Italy's long, largely
unpatrolled coasts attract smugglers, who pull up to beaches during
the night and drop off the immigrants who have paid thousands of
dollars for the voyage.

Israel refuses to extradite Polish Jew accused of atrocities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Israel has refused to extradite to Poland
a Jewish man accused of atrocities against German prisoners after
World War II, the Justice Ministry said Monday.
	   Solomon Morel, who commanded a camp for German prisoners in
southern Poland, allegedly tortured inmates and was considered
responsible for at least 1,538 deaths, according to the Justice
Ministry.
	   Poland requested Morel's extradition in April on charges of
beating and torturing prisoners and creating inhuman conditions at
the Swietochlowice camp, which he commanded from February to
November 1945.
	   Israel sent a letter last month that said it refused to
extradite Morel to Poland to face the charges. Orit Shemesh, a
spokeswoman for the Israeli Justice Ministry, said the statue of
limitations had run out on the case.
	   A spokeswoman for the Polish Justice Ministry, Barbara
Makosa-Stepkowska, said the charges against Morel failed to meet
the definition of genocide under Israeli law.
	   She said Israel's decision ends the case in Poland, which lacks
the power to appeal. Morel could only be arrested if he left
Israel, Makosa-Stepkowska said.
	   The investigation was the only one in Poland against a Jew
accused of retaliating against the Germans after their defeat.
	   Polish investigators opened the case in 1992. In seeking Morel's
extradition, they said the ``extremely bad conditions'' at the camp
included hunger, overcrowding and epidemic diseases that led to an
unspecified number of deaths.
	   Morel, who lost his parents and two brothers during the war,
moved to Israel in 1994.

Russia's second city holds election marred by violence, dirty

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ St. Petersburg was at the
forefront of this country's democracy movement a decade ago, but as
it heads into city elections Sunday, its politics are now
considered as dirty and deadly as anywhere in Russia.
	   Last month's killing of Galina Starovoitova, the country's most
prominent female politician, drew international condemnation and
focused attention on St. Petersburg, a city that has failed to meet
its high expectations in the post-Soviet era.
	   The run-up to the election has been marred by several contract
killings of politicians and leading businessmen, beatings and
drive-by shootings against candidates and frequent reports of dirty
tricks by campaigners.
	   ``Five years ago we could hardly imagine that elections to the
St. Petersburg Legislative Assembly would include threats,
blackmail and assault,'' the head of Russia's Federal Security
Service, Vladimir Putin, said in an interview with the newspaper
Peterburgsky Chas Pik.
	   Boris Nemtsov, the former first deputy premier, recently visited
the city and called it ``the crime capital of Russia.''
	   In this atmosphere, 587 candidates are competing for 50 seats in
the city assembly. Unlike many cities in Russia, where the city
legislature has little power, this body could be quite influential.
	   A new city charter, introduced this year after a bitter battle,
calls for the legislature to be a full-time body with extensive
powers.
	   Gov. Alexander Yakovlev _ the city's mayor despite his title _
strongly opposed the new charter, which curtails his clout.
	   Yakovlev is not on the ballot and has not been actively
campaigning for individual candidates. But critics say the powerful
Yakovlev has contributed to the mean-spirited atmosphere
surrounding the election.
	   Prominent liberal politicians opposed to Yakovlev have found
that people who share the same name were mysteriously proposed as
candidates. This has been done in an attempt to confuse voters and
take away votes from liberals.
	   For example, when voters go to the polls, there will be two
``Sergei Belyayevs'' on the ballot. Voters may be hard-pressed to
determine which one is the well-known liberal and which one is the
anonymous decoy candidate.
	   In addition, anti-Semitic leaflets have been handed out asking
citizens not to vote for Jewish candidates, and one candidate's
posters were defaced with slurs against Jews.
	   There have also been multiple reports of attempts to bribe
voters.
	   Pensioners have reportedly been taken on ``free excursions'' _
bus rides with presents and free vodka _ which end at a polling
station where the retirees are told that the trip was sponsored by
a certain candidate whom they were asked to vote for.
	   St. Petersburg's 3.7 million voters seem fed up with the city's
crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance, but it's
not clear that they will turn out in large numbers.
	   St. Petersburg, which is Russia's second-largest city after
Moscow, had seemed a likely candidate for prosperity in the
post-Soviet era.
	   It's been a liberal, Westward-leaning city ever since the
Russian Czar Peter the Great built it from scratch at the beginning
of the 18th century and dubbed it the country's ``window on the
West.''
	   St. Petersburg produced many of the country's democratic
reformers and free-market economists in the late 1980s and early
1990s, but the city has languished since then.
	   The murder of Starovoitova seemed to symbolize much of what's
gone wrong. No one has been arrested for the Nov. 20 killing of
Starovoitova, who was a member of the national legislature and was
not on Sunday's ballot.
	   But her movement, Northern Capital, was based in St. Petersburg
and is expected to make a solid showing. She was an outspoken
critic of political corruption, and the Russian media has
speculated that she was killed by political opponents.

Astronauts face first hurdle: hoisting first American-made station
</HEADLINE>
part &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Lifting of Unity component scheduled for around 5 p.m. EST. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCIA DUNN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Aerospace Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Endeavour's astronauts faced their
first hurdle Saturday in building the international space station:
hoisting the 25,000-pound Unity chamber from the shuttle cargo bay,
with only an inch of clearance on either side.
	   An even tougher job awaits them Sunday, when they pluck a much
larger Russian station component from orbit and attach it to the
U.S. piece without a direct line of sight.
	   The six shuttle astronauts have been chasing the component named
Zarya (Russian for Sunrise) since they rocketed into orbit Friday.
As of midday Saturday, they trailed the giant cylinder by 7,000
miles.
	   Astronaut Nancy Currie flexed Endeavour's 50-foot robot arm in
preparation for all the lifting; the arm has never wielded such
massive objects before. She and her crewmates also checked the
computerized vision system she'll use to line up the two station
components; they're so big she won't be able to see where they meet
by looking out the window.
	   ``It's not so much a case of how difficult it is,'' Currie
explained before the flight, ``just how careful we have to be and
how time-consuming it is.''
	   Unity, the first American-made piece of the space station, will
serve as a connecting passageway once more modules arrive over the
next few years. It's 36 feet long and 15 feet in diameter, and is
composed of 50,000 mechanical parts, 216 fluid and gas lines, and
121 electrical cables containing a mind-boggling six miles of
wiring.
	   It barely fit in Endeavour's cargo bay, widthwise; there was
only an inch to spare on either side, making Currie's job
especially difficult. The last thing she wanted to do was bump
Unity against the shuttle while lifting it from its horizontal
position and setting it upright in preparation for Sunday's
coupling with Zarya.
	   The 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, launched Nov. 20 from
Kazakstan, contains all the power and propulsion systems needed for
the fledgling space station. Without Zarya, Unity would be a
useless, empty can in orbit.
	   ``I think Sunrise is very appropriate and I think Unity is very
appropriate for the new station because it's a new beginning and
we're all bound together,'' shuttle commander Robert Cabana said
from orbit.
	   Unity cost $300 million, Zarya $240 million. The National
Aeronautics and Space Administration paid for both.
	   NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin wondered aloud after Friday's
launch whether the astronauts would pull everything off.
	   ``We've practiced with robots. We've practiced with the
shuttle,'' Goldin said. ``But now we're doing the real thing with
hardware that cost a quarter of a billion dollars. Will we pull it
off? I'm going to worry every day.''

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ More than 500 candidates Sunday
vied for 50 Legislative Assembly seats in an election preceded by
contract killings, beatings of candidates and and dirty tricks by
campaigners.
	   A total of 577 names were on the ballot and observers predicted
that none of the candidates would get the 51 percent of the vote
needed to win a seat in the assembly, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said. A second round of balloting was likely to be held Dec. 20, it
said.
	   Initial voter turnout was low, with only 2.57 percent of the
city's registered voters casting ballots by midday, the Interfax
news agency said. Preliminary election results were expected early
Monday.
	   St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, was at the
forefront of this country's democracy movement a decade ago, but as
it headed into the elections, its politics appeared as dirty and
deadly as anywhere in Russia.
	   There have been several attacks on prominent figures, including
politicians and businessmen.
	   Last year, the city's deputy governor was gunned down on a
central St. Petersburg street. In the past two months, hitmen have
claimed the lives of a legislative aide, a high-ranking city
official and a prominent banker.
	   Last month's killing of Galina Starovoitova, the country's most
prominent female politician, drew international condemnation and
focused attention on St. Petersburg's crime problems.
	   Boris Nemtsov, the former first deputy premier, recently visited
the city and called it ``the crime capital of Russia.''
	   Unlike many cities in Russia, where the city legislature has
little power, the assembly could be quite influential. A new city
charter calls for the legislature to be a full-time body with
extensive powers.
	   Alexander Yakovlev, the city's mayor, strongly opposed the new
charter, which curtails his clout. He is not on the ballot, but
critics say he has contributed to the mean-spirited atmosphere
surrounding the election.
	   Opponents of Yakovlev have found that people with the same name

attempt to confuse voters and take away votes from liberals.
	   In addition, anti-Semitic leaflets have been handed out asking
citizens not to vote for Jewish candidates, and one candidate's
posters were defaced with slurs against Jews.
	   There have also been multiple reports of attempts to bribe
voters.
	   St. Petersburg's 3.7 million voters seem fed up with the city's
crime and corruption, and its poor economic performance, and
election officials predicted that only 35 percent of the electorate
would turn out for Sunday's polling, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Some 5,000 police were deployed to ensure law and order during
the balloting, the news agency said. Before polls opened, police
examined 1,500 polling stations, looking for explosives or other
items that could disrupt voting, it said.

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Several hundred opponents of President
Alexander Lukashenko gathered near his official residence Sunday to
commemorate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
	   Although police had ordered the rally moved to another square in
the center of the city, the demonstrators went ahead with the rally
at Oktyabryskaya Square, about 200 meters (yards) from Lukashenko's
residence.
	   Five people were arrested by plainclothes officers, opposition
officials said. It was not clear what the charges were against
them. Organizers of the rally also complained that they were
summoned to police headquarters before the rally.
	   ``The attitude of the authorities to this rally shows that in
this country there is no power of law, but the power of force. The
human rights of life, information and law are violated in
Belarus,'' said Youri Khadyka, deputy chairman of the Popular
Front, the main opposition organization.
	   In speeches at the rally, opposition leaders complained that
Lukashenko, an authoritarian president who would like to revive the
Soviet Union, has consistently violated human rights.
	   Oleg Belyavsky, the main organizer of the protest, charged that
500 people had been unjustly arrested or beaten by authorities this
year, and that thousands of people have been politically repressed
over the past four years of Lukashenko's rule.
	   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the
U.N. General Assembly on Dec. 10, 1948.

Runoffs needed for most seats in St. Petersburg elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DMITRY LOVETSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Most local seats up for grabs in
Russia's second largest city were still undecided today after an
election marred by bomb threats and complaints of voter fraud.
	   Officials said today that only six of 50 seats were decided in
Sunday's election for the St. Petersburg legislative assembly. The
rest will have runoffs Dec. 20.
	   The six seats were all held by incumbent deputies. Candidates
must get more than 50 percent of the vote to win in the first
round. The top two vote winners face each other in a second round.
	   Liberals took a prominent lead in the first round, with 22
members of the liberal Yabloko party and nine people from other
reform-minded parties still in the race.
	   Ten communists, as well as the city's former police chief, a
movie actress and the author of a tell-all book about the former
mayor of St. Petersburg are also still in the running.
	   Observers were eager to see how the elections would reflect
public reaction to rising crime in St. Petersburg, especially the
Nov. 20 killing of Galina Starovoitova, a lawmaker in the Russian
parliament.
	   Starovoitova supporters speculated she was killed so that her
faction, Northern Capital, would fare poorly in the election. Her
slaying, however, may have had the opposite effect.
	   In addition, a legislative aide, a high-ranking city official
and a prominent banker have been slain in the last two months.
	   The elections were marred by violence, racial slurs against
Jewish candidates and complaints of ballot box stuffing. The City
Electoral Commission also reported complaints of voter bribery, and
bomb threats forced the temporary closure of three stations.
	   Still, voter turnout was high by current Russian standards _
around 40 percent.

Muslim region in Russia reinstates bride-prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Religious authorities in a largely Muslim region
in southern Russia have reinstated an ancient practice that
requires men to pay a woman's parents for the right to marry her, a
news report said Monday.
	   The bride-price has been set at 2,000 rubles (about 100
dollars), the ITAR-Tass news agency reported _ a significant amount
in the impoverished, restive region of Ingushetia.
	   The money must be handed over on the wedding day, and later the
husband must also provide two sets of bed linen and two sets of
clothing _ summer and winter _ for his wife.
	   Violators will be punished by being shunned by other residents
in their town or village, the report said.
	   While the practice has not been codified as a law, few
apparently dare to disobey it. Ingushetia has seen a steady
increase in the number of bachelors because many men cannot afford
to pay the 2,000 rubles, ITAR-Tass reported.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. peace efforts in Kosovo
suffered a setback Monday when the chief ethnic Albanian negotiator
rejected a proposal for the future of the secessionist province of
Serbia.
	   The plan was presented by U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who has
been trying to hammer out a peace formula acceptable to both the
majority ethnic Albanians and the government of Serbia.
	   Fehmi Agani, head of the Kosovo Albanian negotiating team, said
the latest version of the U.S. peace plan was ``almost identical to
the Serbian proposal for Kosovo'' and ``cannot be considered a
basis for ... future negotiations.''
	   Agani said the previous U.S. draft for Kosovo ``envisaged the
formation of independent institutions'' in the province, although
it did not provide for independence as the majority ethnic
Albanians have demanded. The Serbs rejected that version.
	   Agani, however, said the latest U.S. proposal incorporated a
major Serb demand, which is to have Kosovo remain part of Serbia _
and within its legal system.
	   Although a de-facto cease fire generated by an agreement to end
a government crackdown in Kosovo has reduced bloodshed, there are
fears that Kosovo will again explode in fierce fighting unless a
political solution is found by spring.
	   Clashes this year pitting an alliance of Yugoslav army and Serb
police forces against rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army claimed
hundreds of lives and made more than a quarter of a million people
homeless. Serbia is the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   But Hill's efforts so far have been fruitless with the two sides
unable to agree on a formula.
	   Ivan Sedlak, a member of the Serbian government delegation for
Kosovo talks, said the government side still hasn't studied the
latest version of Hill's plan.
	   Sedlak said a previous version was unacceptable because it
defined Kosovo virtually as a separate state. But Sedlak did not
comment on the reworked draft.
	   A previous version of the U.S. draft was rejected by Serbia
because it gave the republic almost no control over Kosovo. But
that formula was cautiously greeted by ethnic Albanian negotiators
and the guerrillas gave a mixed response, with one faction not
ruling it out as an interim solution, and the other rejecting it.
	   ``We had some objections to the previous version too, but this
one is totally unacceptable,'' Agani told Glas. ``It is obvious
that Hill offers one solution after talking to us and another after
talking to (Serbian president Milan) Milutinovic.''
	   It was not clear what changes were made to the previous draft,
but Agani's criticism suggested the reworked version gave Serbia
more authority in Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who make up more than 90 percent of Kosovo's
population, overwhelmingly seek independence from Serbia.

Embattled Netanyahu government maneuvers out of showdown in

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Facing possible defeat over a bill calling for
early elections, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
maneuvered his way out of a showdown on Monday that might have
ended his term at Israel's helm.
	   With a majority of legislators poised to vote in favor of the
bill during the first of three readings scheduled Monday, Netanyahu
engineered a motion of no-confidence in his own government, a move
that delays the vote for at least a week.
	   The bill is considered an indicator of parliamentary
dissatisfaction with Netanyahu and it highlighted the premier's
struggles to hold together his crumbling coalition over the latest
Mideast land-for-peace agreement Israel signed with the
Palestinians against the wishes of the majority of his coalition
members.
	   To buy time while he held marathon negotiations with hard-line
coalition members earlier, Netanyahu sent Deputy Minister Michael
Eitan to the Knesset floor to start a filibuster. Eitan once set an
Israeli record for filibusters, remaining on the podium for 11
hours.
	   Taking his own turn at the lectern after the house agreed to
turn the vote into a motion of no-confidence, Netanyahu battled
catcalls and interruptions from the opposition while explaining the
compromise and defending his policies.
	   A preliminary reading in August passed and the bill would need
to pass three additional readings before the parliament was
dissolved and new elections were called.
	   Netanyahu has been embroiled in political crisis since he signed
the accord in October to cede more West Bank land to the
Palestinians against the wishes of a majority of his coalition
members.

Boca chasing perfect season; Crucial Monday night in Chile
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The undefeated streak continues.
Twelve wins, six ties and most importantly, no losses. Now that
Argentina's Boca Juniors has won the season championship, they are
after a perfect season.
	   For Boca, the days after winning the Apertura tournament were
full of celebration and endless media attention. A 5-0 win on
Wednesday in a friendly match against Chile's Universidad Catolica
put an exclamation point on the team's achievements.
	   Perhaps that's why Boca came out slow in Sunday's match against
Lanus, where they needed a second-half goal to keep the season's
unbeaten streak going. Lanus scored early, at the 11th minute mark,
and seemed determined to bring Boca's week of festivities to an
end.
	   Antonio Barijho scored one minute after subbing in the match, in
the 69th minute, on a header between the legs of Lanus goalkeeper,
Elizaga.
	   With Boca's success this year, European teams are eyeing many of
the team's top players. English clubs are reportedly interested in
striker Martin Palermo. His partner up front, Guillermo Schelotto,
has allegedly caught the attention of French and Spanish clubs.
	   And the president of Spain's Real Madrid said on Monday he would
love to have 20-year-old midfield Juan Riquelme, according to
Buenos Aires sports daily Ole.
	   Boca coach Carlos Bianchi has insisted the team remain intact
for another run at the championship.
	   ``I'm not going to disrupt anyone's career,'' he said. ``But I
think next year we're going to have the same players.''
	   Monday night in Chile may help determine the season-long fight
between Colo Colo and Universidad de Chile for the league
championship.
	   Colo Colo, with 58 points, heads off to Concepcion with a one
point advantage over Universidad de Chile, who will face Huachipato
at home tonight.
	   Both teams play at home next week.
	   With only one game left in the season, other teams are fighting
relegation into the 2nd dvision.
	   Rangers trounced Osorno 5-1, pushing the last place team even
closer to playing in the lower division next year. Osorno needs a
victory next week to avoid joining Temuco, which lost its
first-division status last week when players chose not to show up
for a match in protest of not receiving their salaries.
	   However, they managed to field a team on Sunday, and notched a
surprise 3-2 victory over Iquique.

Nobel Lit lecture: peasant's son Saramago tells how he became a

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Somewhere along the way, Nobel
Literature laureate Jose Saramago says, his characters took on
lives of their own.
	   When his first book took shape nearly 60 years ago, he figured
his ``men and women of paper and ink'' were ``obedient to my will
... like puppets,'' Saramago said Monday evening in his prize
lecture.
	   To his surprise, they developed so far that he sensed they had
become his master and he their apprentice.
	   ``Letter by letter, word by word, page by page, book after book:
I have been successively implanting in the man I was the characters
I created,'' he said. ``I believe that without them, I wouldn't be
the person I am today....
	   ``I don't have, as it were, more voice than the voices they had.
Forgive me if what has seemed little to you, to me is all.''
	   It has been a winding, unpredictable road for the slender,
quizzical-looking peasant's son who trained to be a mechanic, all
the while spending nights voraciously reading poetry at public
libraries.
	   He walked barefoot _ ``with straws still stuck in my hair'' _
until he was 14. Now 76, he is the toast of the literary world,
lecturing several hundred people in fine clothes at the august
Swedish Academy in an ornate room with busts, statues and 13
glittering chandeliers.
	   The avowed communist and atheist seemed slightly embarrassed, if
secretly amused or pleased, at the standing ovation. He
acknowledged the applause with quick deferential nods, and tried
unsuccessfully to draw his wife from her front-row seat to the
stage with him.
	   He was more relaxed two evenings before when he spoke with
reporters at the airport shortly after arrival.
	   Celebrity, not to mention the prize money of 7.6 million kronor
(dlrs 950,000), is gratifying but ``It wouldn't be worth it to
change your life ... just because of a prize,'' he said.
	   Saramago's roots were his early literary inspiration. In his
half-hour lecture, he recalled sleeping outdoors under a fig tree
while his grandfather _ a manual laborer who never lost his sense
of the world's wonder _ would tell stories under the stars.
	   ``The wisest man I ever knew in my whole life could not read or
write,'' were his lecture's opening words. From personal memories,
his writing touched universal themes. His sympathies were always
with the common man.
	   With his usual irony and humor, he took potshots at familiar
targets: organized religion, particularly the Roman Catholic
Church, authoritarian governments, greedy landlords and intolerance
of every stripe.

	   SALERNO, Italy (AP) _ Dagobert Song may soon join Liverpool in

	   The 22-year-old defender from Cameroon and his agent will travel
to England Thursday to possibly sign a contract with Liverpool,
Salernitana officials said Monday.
	   ``He's a a very good defender but has problems in getting used
to the team tactics,'' club president Aniello Aliberti said. ``We
are ready to agree on his transfer.''
	   Song joined Salernitana in the off season, moving from France's

North Korea accuses U.S. of seeking a pretext to ignite war
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ North Korea's military leaders accused the
United States of seeking a pretext to ignite a second war on the
divided Korean Peninsula and warned they would strike any nation
that helps U.S. forces, according to a U.N. document released
Monday.
	   The general staff of the North Korean People's Army said
Washington has recently gone ``beyond the danger line'' with a
reported new five-stage plan to wage war and increased military
preparations against the North.
	   The military leaders said warnings by conservative hard-liners
in the United States that Washington would break its nuclear
agreement with Pyongyang if it can't inspect a suspected nuclear
weapons site were ``like a declaration of war.''
	   Under the 1994 agreement with the United States, North Korea
agreed to abandon its suspect nuclear weapons program. In return,
it is to receive two safe nuclear reactors worth dlrs 4.6 billion
plus substitute fuel oil and other economic benefits.
	   North Korea's U.N. Ambassador Li Hyong Chol asked the Security
Council to circulate the statement from an unidentified spokesman
for the army's general staff. Parts of the statement were carried
Friday by the North's official Korean Central News Agency.
	   The statement comes as the United States and North Korea resume
talks about the underground North Korean site suspected of being
used to produce nuclear weapons.
	   North Korea, which has asked Washington to pay dlrs 300 million
for the right to inspect the site, reported no progress during two
days of talks in New York on Friday and Saturday. Discussions were
continuing Monday and Tuesday in Washington.
	   The communist state's news media frequently publish
saber-rattling rhetoric. But South Korean officials said it was
unusual for North Korea's hard-line military, which forms the
backbone of the government, to make a public statement. The North's
1.1 million-strong military is the world's fifth largest.
	   Washington has adopted ``a reckless adventure, losing all
reason,'' and is already starting to execute the first stage of its
war plan which calls for full-scale sanctions and a blockade of
North Korea's skies, seas and borders, the military spokesman said.
	   ``Now that the United States of America has thrown off the mask
of `dialogue and negotiation' and is bringing the situation to the
brink of war, we solemnly declare ... that our revolutionary armed
forces will never pardon the challenge of the United States
aggressive forces but answer it with an annihilating blow,'' the
spokesman said.
	   The military chiefs said they pre-emptive strikes are not a
monopoly of the United States and warned that ``there is no limit
to the reach of our people's army.''
	   ``It must also be realized that the target of our strike in the
war is not only the United States aggressive forces ... but also
the South Korean authorities who are willing to serve as their
shield, Japan and all others that offer bases or act as servants
behind the scenes,'' the military leaders said.

Britain to take duty-free campaign to EU summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Britain failed Monday to gain
sufficient support to overturn a planned European Union ban on
duty-free shopping, but pledged to pursue its campaign at this
week's EU summit in Vienna.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told reporters the
scheduled abolition is for many British people ``the most visible
and high-profile impact of any decision by the European Union.''
	   Britain and France are leading a struggle to extend the life of
the popular tax-free sales on flights, ports and ferry crossings
beyond June 30, 1999, when the EU is scheduled to scrap them.
	   But although Germany, Ireland, Spain and Luxembourg expressed
support at Monday's meeting, only a unanimous vote by all 15 EU
nations can save duty-free. Denmark stood out against the reprieve
Monday, and the Netherlands, Portugal, Italy, Finland and Sweden
also have reservations.
	   Cook said Prime Minister Tony Blair would seek to over come
their resistance at the year-end summit Friday and Saturday in
Vienna, Austria.
	   ``It's never a bad idea to review a bad decision,'' Cook said.
	   The EU unanimously in 1991 to abolish the tax free shopping by
the summer of 1999, claiming it was incompatible with the notion of
a borderless EU market. Since then governments have changed in many
EU nations and airlines, shipping companies and labor unions have
pursued a high-profile lobbying campaign.
	   They claim scrapping the dlrs 6.4-billion-a-year duty-free
industry will push up the cost of travel and throw some 150,000
people out of work.
	   The EU Commission argues that duty-free operators effectively
enjoy a subsidy of dlrs 2.2 billion a year by not paying duties on
their sales, giving them an unfair advantage over other retailers.
	   The ban only affects sales for travelers within the EU. Those
traveling to or from the Union will still be able to enjoy tax free
shopping.

Madrid cathedral takes credit cards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Seeking to boost donations, a cathedral in
Madrid has started taking credit cards.
	   Wooden collection boxes are no more at Almudena Cathedral. In
their place are a pair of electronic gadgets into which
parishioners insert plastic, then punch in how much they want to
give.
	   Cathedral officials told the daily El Pais they were acting
because donations are down, apparently because people are afraid of
getting robbed on the street and carry little cash to church.
	   The electronic boxes were inaugurated Sunday. They cost the
church nothing because the banking consortium that installed and
runs them keeps a two percent commission for itself.
	   Churchgoers said they were not surprised by the cathedral's
high-tech upgrade. After all, one pointed out, it had already done
away with real-wax votive candles and replaced them with
coin-operated electric ones.

U.N. chief says `positive progress' in Lockerbie case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Gulf-Summit &QL; 
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Monday there has been ``positive progress'' in
resolving the dispute with Libya over the Lockerbie bombing.
	   But he said it was too early to predict when Tripoli might agree
to the trial of two Libyans wanted in connection with the 1988
bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270
people.
	   Kofi spoke at a news conference after addressing the opening of
a summit by leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council. The GCC groups
Gulf Arab states with the aim of economic and political
cooperation.
	   ``We made positive progress,'' Annan said of his weekend meeting
with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. ``We're on our way to resolving
the issue.''
	   He added: ``It will take time, but (we) hope not a lot of
time.''
	   Asked when Libya might respond to the U.S.-British offer for a
trial of the suspects in the Netherlands, Annan said: ``I can't
give a precise date. They understand the reality. It is up to them
to make an announcement.''
	   He noted, however, that Libyan Foreign Minister Omar
al-Muntasser has said a decision won't take long.
	   The Libyan People's Congress, or parliament, was scheduled to
meet on Tuesday to discuss the Lockerbie case.
	   Annan met al-Muntasser in the northern Libyan city of Sirte on
Saturday before being driven into the desert for a meeting with
Gadhafi.
	   Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a joint
U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects before a panel of
Scottish judges in the Netherlands.
	   Libya _ which had resisted any attempts to extradite Abdel
Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah on grounds they
couldn't get a fair trial in the West _ has accepted the
U.S.-British offer in principle.
	   But the Libyans have expressed concerns for the suspects'
security in the Netherlands, saying they feared they could be
kidnapped and taken to the United States. They also have asked that
if convicted, the men serve their sentences in Libya.

Exhibition game set for Dec. 19 in Atlantic City
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Monday's developments &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Michael Jordan won't play, yet courtside tickets
will still cost dlrs 1,000.
	   A long-rumored exhibition game featuring locked-out National
Basketball Association players was finally announced Monday by
agents David Falk and Arn Tellem.
	   ``The Game on Showtime'' is set for Dec. 19 in Atlantic City,
New Jersey, with the proceeds going to charity and to NBA players
in financial need.
	   ``If you look at people who play professional sports, not a lot
of them are financially secure,'' union president Patrick Ewing
said. ``They make a lot of money, and they also spend a lot of
money.
	   ``Me, I'm financially secure, but there a lot of others who
aren't. Our objective is to help these people. No matter how much
money they've made throughout their careers, if they're in need now
then it's up to us to try and help them,'' Ewing said.
	   Thirteen players are committed to play, and organizers hope to
have a total of 16 players who were members of the four Dream teams
_ the 1992 and 1996 Olympic teams and the 1994 and 1998 World
Championship teams.
	   Ewing, Karl Malone, Penny Hardaway, Tim Hardaway, Allan Houston,
Reggie Miller, Alonzo Mourning, Tom Gugliotta, Gary Payton,
Dominique Wilkins, Vin Baker, Glen Rice and Mitch Richmond have
committed.
	   Among those who have not are Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Charles
Barkley, Scottie Pippen, Isiah Thomas, Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem
Olajuwon, Grant Hill and John Stockton.
	   Derick Coleman and Larry Johnson, members of the 1994 World
Championship team, were not invited.
	   Jordan's absence is particularly noteworthy because Falk, his
agent, is one of the main organizers.
	   ``Michael has said he won't make a decision about returning to
professional basketball or retiring until the lockout is over,''
said Curtis Polk, president of Falk's sports management company.
``We did talk to Michael about the game, obviously, and Michael
feels he needs to stand by his earlier statement that he'll wait
for a resolution of the lockout before he makes that decision. He
wouldn't want to send the fans a sort of mixed message by his
participation in this game.''
	   Ewing said Jordan might show up, but won't play.
	   The Atlantic City game will be the latest in a recent string of
exhibitions involving locked out players. Games were held last
weekend in Miami and Dallas, and another is scheduled for next
Sunday in Los Angeles.
	   Jay Larkin, executive producer of Showtime, would not reveal how
much the cable network was paying for the broadcast rights.
	   Polk said the largest expense would be insurance, with every
player covered for dlrs 20 million against a career-ending injury.
	   None of the players will be paid, and no criteria has been
established for determining which players will share in the
proceeds.
	   Mourning, who said players are not asking for the fans'
sympathy, explained that few people realize how many mouths must be
fed by an NBA player's salary. The lockout, now 23 weeks old, has
caused the first two months of the season to be scrapped. No new
negotiations are planned.
	   ``The average life expectancy of a player is four or five years,
and in that time we try to make as much money as we can in as short
a period of time to try to build a strong financial base for the
rest of our lives,'' Mourning said.
	   ``We do have a lot of expenses. Everybody's hands are out and
you try to help as many people as you can. And this game right here
is a way to support the guys who are struggling financially at this
time,'' he said.
	   Organizers hoped to raise at least dlrs 1 million in proceeds.
The game will be held at the Atlantic City Convention Center, which
seats about 17,000. Tickets will cost from dlrs 25 to dlrs 1,000.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Joe DiMaggio's fight for life has turned more
urgent with his doctor reporting Monday that the baseball Hall of
Famer's condition had deteriorated dramatically.
	   ``Joe has had a significant and serious turn for the worse,''
said Dr. Earl Barron, who has been treating DiMaggio following lung
cancer surgery in October.
	   ``The outlook has dimmed over the past 72 hours. He's not in
good shape.''
	   The 84-year-old New York Yankees great has been unable to shake
a stubborn lung infection and fever since undergoing surgery Oct.
14.
	   After DiMaggio showed some improvement last week, the infection
is back, Barron said.
	   ``He is being treated with more antibiotics and his blood
pressure is being maintained with medications,'' the doctor said.
	   DiMaggio remains in the intensive care unit at Memorial Regional
Hospital in Hollywood, Florida. He entered the hospital Oct. 12 and
underwent surgery to have a cancerous tumor removed from his right
lung two days later.
	   His attorney and close friend, Morris Engelberg, spent Monday
afternoon at the hospital, and did not immediately return telephone
calls.
	   DiMaggio has experienced a number of peaks and valleys following
the surgery.
	   Twice in October, his lungs were drained after filling with
fluid from an infection. On Nov. 16, his blood pressure dropped so
rapidly that a Catholic priest was summoned to administer the last
rites.
	   Each time, however, he has rallied.
	   ``He takes two steps forward and one back,'' Barron said last
week.
	   On Thursday, when Barron temporarily adjusted the breathing tube
in his throat, DiMaggio said, ``I want to get the hell out of here
and go home.''
	   He seemed to be moving closer to that goal until the latest
setback.
	   ``I saw him this morning,'' Barron said on Monday. ``We are
continuing supportive care. The outlook is not as good as it was a
few days ago.''
	   DiMaggio has guarded his privacy intently since his retirement
from baseball in 1951, and information about his condition has been
tightly controlled.
	   His last public appearance was Sept. 27, when he was honored at
Yankee Stadium and received replicas of nine championship rings
that were stolen from his hotel room three decades ago. The Yankees
had wanted him to throw out the ceremonial first pitch at the World
Series, but by then, he was in the hospital.
	   He marked his 84th birthday in the hospital on Nov. 25,
surrounded by family, including his brother, Dom, and two
great-grandchildren.
	   Engelberg had set various targets for DiMaggio's return home _
his birthday, Thanksgiving, even 56 days to parallel his famous
56-game hitting streak in 1941 _ but each has passed.
	   DiMaggio spent his 56th day in the hospital on Sunday.

Embattled Netanyahu government faces showdown in parliament

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Facing possible defeat over a bill calling for
early elections, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
maneuvered his way out of a showdown Monday that might have ended
his term at Israel's helm.
	   With a majority of legislators poised to vote in favor of the
bill during the first of three readings scheduled Monday, Netanyahu
engineered a motion of no confidence in his own government, a move
which delays the vote for at least a week.
	   The bill shows parliamentary dissatisfaction with Netanyahu and
highlights his struggles to hold together his crumbling coalition
over the latest Mideast land-for-peace agreement Israel signed with
the Palestinians against the wishes most of his coalition members.
	   To buy time while he held marathon negotiations with hard-line
coalition members earlier, Netanyahu sent Deputy Minister Michael
Eitan to the Knesset floor to start a filibuster. Eitan once set an
Israeli record of 11 hours on the podium, a tactic used to delay
proceedings.
	   Taking his own turn at the lectern after the house agreed to
turn the vote into a motion of no-confidence, Netanyahu battled
catcalls and interruptions from the opposition while explaining the
compromise and defending his policies.
	   A preliminary reading in August passed and the bill would need
to pass three additional readings before the parliament was
dissolved and new elections were called.
	   Netanyahu has been embroiled in political crisis since he signed
the accord in October to cede more West Bank land to the
Palestinians against the wishes of a majority of his coalition
members.
	   The latest turmoil comes less than a week before U.S. President
Bill Clinton is to arrive, to preside over the next phase of the
accord. However Netanyahu has frozen further troop withdrawals
saying the Palestinians have violated the accord.
	   In suspending progress however, Netanyahu lost the safety net in
parliament the dovish labor party guaranteed it would provide in
order to ensure the government remained in power as long as it was
implementing the accord.
	   Labor party leader Ehud Barak said a vote to bring down the
Netanyahu government would not halt the peace process.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian police opened fire Monday on
rioters protesting Israel's refusal to release Palestinian
prisoners _ the first sign that the Palestinian police were
containing violence in advance of President Bill Clinton's visit
this week.
	   In the West Bank city of Nablus, Palestinian police fired from
rooftops onto some 3,000 Palestinians, mostly bystanders who had
gathered to watch the rioting. Witnesses said at least five people
were wounded.
	   A Jewish settler driving near the city of Jenin, also in the
northern West Bank, was shot and wounded from gunfire towards his
car, the Israeli army said. The settler, a resident of the nearby
settlement of Ganim, managed to drive to an Israeli army outpost
several kilometers (miles) away and was taken from there to a
hospital in Afula, Israel.
	   The shooting at a settler was the first since the Israeli army
withdrew from that area last month as part of the Mideast
land-for-peace accord and left Ganim and several other settlements
isolated and surrounded by Palestinian-controlled areas.

Despite internal struggles, EU remains upbeat on expansion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with foreign ministers sending enlargement report to
summit; RECASTS lead graf; TRIMS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The EU foreign ministers failed to
overcome disagreements about European Union expansion Monday, yet
still tried to sound welcoming to newcomers without setting
specific entry dates.
	   The ministers failed to lift an impasse on how to fund a
near-doubling of the EU or on how fast to expand it _ issues will
dominate a two-day summit opening Friday in Vienna.
	   Yet the foreign ministers sent the summit an upbeat report,
saying efforts to bring Cyprus, 10 East European nations and,
possibly, Malta into the EU in the next decade are well on track.
	   But that did not hide a North-South split about enlargement and
what needs to be done do to make it possible.
	   Negotiations opened this fall with Cyprus, Hungary, Poland, the
Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia and preliminary talks with
slower-track candidates Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and
Bulgaria.
	   Despite prodding from the east, the EU refuses to set entry
dates to ensure candidates keep up efforts to get ready for
membership.
	   On Monday, Greece objected to Turkey being included in the
enlargement report to the summit since it is not negotiating
membership due to its dubious human rights record.
	   The first newcomers won't join until 2004 or 2005.
	   Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are expected to get in
first. The Netherlands, Germany, France and Italy have doubts about
admitting a divided Cyprus.
	   Germany and France oppose accelerating talks with Lithuania,
Latvia and Slovakia _ slow-trackers which the EU head office says
do better than expected in getting ready for membership.
	   But Britain, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden, Denmark and
Finland welcomed the idea of moving the three candidates into the
fast lane.
	   Before enlargement can occur, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands,
Sweden and France insist on a fundamental reform of EU finances.
	   They want the EU budget to rise until 2006 only in line with
inflation from this year's level of 86 billion European currency
units (dlrs 100 billion) and oppose a European Commission proposal
to link spending to economic growth, raising the budget by 20
billion ecu (dlrs 23.6 billion).
	   Spain and other southerners held out for increased membership
fees, fearful they will lose special aid deals once even poorer
easterners come into the EU.
	   Germany and other northern members say they already pay far more
into the EU than they get back and want to limit their net
contributions. Germany's net payment is 22 billion marks (dlrs 13
billion) a year.
	   Complicating the money debate is Britain's refusal to give up an
annual rebate which it has been getting since 1984.
	   Worth 2.6 billion pounds (dlrs 4 billion) this year, that rebate
was granted to offset London's net payment but its partners argue
Britain is much better off now than 14 years ago.

Top-ranking ambassor says somebody's out to get him
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ David Gore-Booth, already on his way out after a
stormy tenure as a British ambassador, complained in the Times of
London on Monday that somebody was out to get him.
	   Gore-Booth had already resigned as ambassador to India after his
relationship with Foreign Secretary Robin Cook became strained.
Then came a strongly worded report from the Parliamentary ombudsman
criticizing him for complaining to British Aerospace about one of
its employees.
	   ``Somebody out there is taking pleasure from seeking to destroy
my reputation slice by slice,'' Gore-Booth told the newspaper.
	   This public criticism by a senior ambassador further clouds
Gore-Booth's departure from the Foreign Office after a 34-year
career.
	   The report from the Parliamentary ombudsman called his actions
``indefensible'' when, as ambassador to Saudi Arabia in July 1994,
wrote to British Aerospace criticizing an employee who had written
a letter of complaint to the British Consulate.
	   The employee, Paul Surtees, had written to the consulate asking
questions about its practices and employment policies and
expressing dissatisfaction with the behavior of some of the staff.
	   At the time, Gore-Booth was involved with British Aerospace's
al-Yamamah project in Saudi Arabia, the largest arms contract ever
won by Britain.
	   Surtees was asked to resign. Then, after an investigation, the
British government offered him 5,000 pounds (dlrs 8,250) ``to make
amends for the general mishandling of his complaints.''
	   In his report on the affair, the Parliamentary ombudsman Michael
Buckley said he found the ambassador's comments in his letter to
the British Aerospace boss ``quite extraordinary and wholly
deplorable.''
	   Gore-Booth defended himself to The Times, saying that Surtees'
resignation was unrelated to his criticism, and adding that the
ombudsman ``seem thrilled to have a crack at an ambassador...''

	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Mexico's ruling party
appeared Monday to have dominated make-up elections in southern
Chiapas state, three months after flooding forced officials to
cancel elections in the most affected areas.
	   With nearly 80 percent of the voting counted, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading in all four congressional
districts being voted on, the Chiapas Electoral Council said.
	   That didn't signify a change, however: all four were PRI to
begin with.
	   With 64 percent of the vote counted in nine county mayor's
races, the PRI appeared to have won six, including the town of
Pijijiapan which was devastated by flooding in September.
	   Pijijiapan had been led by the leftist Democratic Revolution
Party, or PRD, and the local government had accused state officials
of channeling relief supplies through the party apparatus instead
of through local officials, as a campaign tool.
	   The PRD appeared to have wrested the nearby town of Mapastepec
from the PRI, and retained its mayorship in Villa Comaltitlan. The
center-right National Action Party appeared to have retained
Huixtla.
	   Final results were expected Tuesday.
	   Voter turnout was light, with 32 percent of eligible voters
casting ballots in the mayors' races and only 25 percent in the
congressional races, the election commission said.
	   Chiapas suffered severe flooding in September, wiping out some
elections records and forcing residents to focus attention on
clearing roads and rebuilding their homes. The Oct. 4 elections
were postponed in eight counties.

Another Iranian intellectual disappears, paper says

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Khatami speech in grafs 6-11. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian writer Mohammed Mokhtari left his
home Thursday and has not been heard of since, adding to a recent
spate of mysterious disappearances, the Zan newspaper reported
Monday.
	   Mokhtari, a poet and member of the Association of Iranian
Writers, left to go shopping in the residential suburb in northern
Tehran, Zan said. It said Mokhtari's family searched hospitals,
morgues and police stations but could not find him.
	   The writer's association to which he belongs has written a
letter to authorities asking them to look into his disappearance.
	   Increasingly, hard-line rivals of President Mohammad Khatami are
resorting to violence to deal with opponents. Over the past year,
vigilantes have attacked dissidents, liberal newspapers and even a
reformist Cabinet minister.
	   None of the thugs has been arrested, leading to suspicions they
are backed by powerful hard-line clerics like spiritual leader Ali
Khamenei and Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, the head of the judiciary.
	   In a speech to university students on Monday, Khatami lashed out
at Iranians who resort to violence, the official Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
	   He said that during his campaign last year, he had argued for
political development, social justice and the rule of law _ ideas
considered by some as too liberal or anti-Islamic.
	   ``It was not our intention to do away with any opposition
view,'' Khatami told the students at Sharif Technical University,
IRNA said.
	   But he noted that this was not understood by some, criticizing
``some groups who dislike the government and are not ready to abide
by the principles of democracy.''
	   Last month the head of an Iranian opposition group, Dariush
Foruhar, and his wife Parvaneh were stabbed to death in their home.
	   Police have said they've made several arrests in the murders of
the Foruhars, after Khatami condemned the killings and ordered an
investigation. So far, the findings have not been made public.

UConn stays No. 1 for second week

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Connecticut, which beat two ranked teams last
week, remained No. 1 in the AP U.S. college basketball poll Monday,
the Huskies' second straight week at the top and the longest run
there in school history.
	   The Huskies (6-0) beat Washington and Michigan State in two
impressive defensive outings and received 53 first-place votes and
1,754 points from the national media panel.
	   The only other time Connecticut was No. 1 was in February 1995,
and the Huskies split their two games that week and didn't return
to the top of the rankings until last week.
	   Maryland (9-0), which beat Wake Forest and Stanford last week,
held second with 17 No. 1 votes and 1,715 points, 116 more than
Duke (7-1), which moved up one spot from last week following wins
over Michigan State and North Carolina State.
	   Cincinnati (5-0), which handed Duke its only loss of the season,
moved up two places to sixth, receiving the only other first-place
vote and 1,555 points.
	   Kentucky moved up three places to No. 5 and was followed by
Stanford, North Carolina, Arizona, Purdue and Kansas.
	   Indiana jumped five spots to 11th and was followed in the top 20
by New Mexico, Syracuse, Michigan State, UCLA, Temple, Clemson, St.
John's, Oklahoma State and Pittsburgh.
	   Tennessee, Washington, Arkansas, Minnesota and Utah rounded out
the poll.
	   Tennessee (6-2) rejoined the rankings after falling out for one
week. The Volunteers, who were ninth in the preseason poll, came
back in following a victory over Pittsburgh.
	   Minnesota (5-0) is back in the Top 25 for the first time since
1996-97 when it was in the whole season, getting as high as No. 2
on the way to the Final Four.
	   Miami, Ohio (4-2) dropped out of the rankings from 22nd after
losses to Xavier and Wisconsin-Green Bay. Xavier (5-3) was 23rd,
but the Musketeers, who were 13th just two weeks ago, lost to
Purdue after the win over Miami.
	   Clemson and St. John's had the week's biggest moves at seven
spots, while Arizona, Purdue, Indiana and New Mexico each jumped
five places.
	   Oklahoma State, which was shocked at home by Florida Atlantic
and lost on the road to UCLA, had the week's biggest fall from No.
11 to No. 19. Washington dropped seven spots after losing to
Connecticut and Boise State, while Temple, which has lost three
straight including road losses to Penn State and Indiana last week,
fell six places.

Threatening class struggle, Haitian leader blames rich and
</HEADLINE>
colonizers &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL NORTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Threatening to provoke a class
struggle, President Rene Preval blamed Haiti's elite and former
colonial powers for the dismal poverty here, in the Western
Hemisphere's poorest nation.
	   His speech, on Sunday, appeared a throwback to the
anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist rhetoric that former President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide preached before he was ousted by the
military and the United States sent troops to restore him to power.
	   Preval told subsistence farmers in Kenscoff, in the hills above
Port-au-Prince, that 1 percent of Haiti's 8 million people control
50 percent of the nation's wealth.
	   ``If 99 percent is to be reconciled with 1 percent, the latter
have to open their hands. I fear that if, after negotiations, they
don't, one day the state will have to force their hands open. That
will be good for no one,'' Preval said. ``That's how reconciliation
will occur. ...''
	   That indicated end to the reconciliation that Aristide
instigated after his return to Haiti in 1994. Preval, Aristide's
protege, won 1995 elections.
	   ``Impoverishing the rich has never enriched the poor,''
countered Olivier Nadal, an importer who is president of the
Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
	   As an example, he gave his 780 hectares (1,950 acres) of land
that he said has been turned into a semi-desert by an invasion of
poor farmers tolerated by the government.
	   Preval, in his speech, blamed the United States for the massive
deforestation that has denuded much of Haiti. He said U.S.
agricultural companies that moved in during the U.S. military
occupation from 1915 to 1934 caused the erosion.
	   ``It's the occupiers that cut the forests down,'' Preval said.
	   He also accused French colonizers of impoverishing Haiti from
the nation's birth in 1804, when it had to pay France millions of
dollars for property loss to win international recognition. Haiti
was the world's first black nation, and the only one where
revolting slaves defeated a colonial army, in this case Napoleon's.
	   Preval's opponents accused the president of seeking to divert
attention from his own failure as the country enters its 18th month
without a functioning government. Premier Rosny Smarth resigned
last year over disputed elections and legislators have refused to
accept any of Preval's nominees in what has developed into a power
struggle between supporters of Smarth and Aristide.

Despite Mandela appeal, wine issue blocks EU trade talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with no agreement on wine dispute, quotes from Mandela
letter, EU negotiator; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Despite an appeal for compromise by
South African President Nelson Mandela, Spain and Portugal refused
to back down Monday in a dispute over wine labels which threatens
to derail a sweeping trade deal between South Africa and the
15-nation European Union.
	   ``South Africa's economic success is by no means guaranteed and
requires an immense effort,'' Mandela wrote to EU leaders as
four-years of tortuous trade negotiations seemed sure to miss their
year-end deadline.
	   EU negotiators had hoped Monday's meeting of foreign ministers
would back the outline of a market-opening deal negotiated last
month in Pretoria to to phase out duties on some 90 percent of
EU-South Africa trade, worth dlrs 19 billion a year.
	   Hopes were dashed by failure to break months of deadlock over
the naming of fortified wines.
	   The Europeans want South African vintners to stop using the
names ``sherry'' or ``port.'' They argue only Spain can produce
wines called sherry and only wines from the Portuguese city of
Oporto can be labeled as port.
	   South Africa claims to have used the terms for 300 years, but
has agreed to a compromise under which they would stop using the
terms on exports to Europe and phase them out over five-to-ten
years in other foreign market.
	   However, South African insists it be allowed to continue
marketing fortified wines as port and sherry in its home market and
in neighboring nations, where the brands are well known as South
African products.
	   ``For the ordinary population the agreement cannot be concluded
by us surrendering the household names in southern Africa of our
own port and sherry,'' Mandela wrote in his letter, extracts of
which were shown to reporters covering the EU meeting.
	   The EU has proposed that South Africa phases out the names in
its domestic market over 13 years. Sales of South African wine
labeled port or sherry are worth about 750 million rand (dlrs 123
million), of which 13 percent comes from exports.
	   EU negotiator Philip Lowe said he would be having continuous
talks with the South Africans in an effort to find a solution. He
hoped the year-end summit of EU leaders in Vienna, Austria, Friday
and Saturday would give indications of the way forward.
	   ``The important thing for the Union and South Africa is that the
heads of state give a clear lead for a new timetable,'' Lowe told
reporters. ``A compromise will have to be found.''
	   At a meeting with Mandela in June, the EU leaders pledged to
wrap up the talks by the autumn. Diplomats fear negotiations could
become bogged down in campaigning for national elections in South
Africa next year if they drag on much longer.

Gulf leaders to focus on oil at annual summit

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES starting 7th graf with Annan's comment at news

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Six Arab Gulf leaders
opened an annual summit Monday that was expected to focus on
falling oil prices, which have hit their economies hard.
	   Shortly before the meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council
began, January futures contracts for Brent crude _ a widely watched
benchmark _ fell to a record low of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on the
International Petroleum Exchange in London.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent.
	   The Gulf oil producers, who control about half of global oil
reserves, have been hard hit by the oil market crisis, which has
been blamed on the recession in Asia and warmer-than-usual winters.
Oil exports account for some 75 percent of their revenues.
	   For the first time, the GCC summit is being attended by leaders
outside the group, including U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
South African President Nelson Mandela.
	   Both told the opening session of the three-day summit that they
hoped the Wye River agreement, brokered by U.S. President Bill
Clinton between Israel and the Palestinians, would lead to peace in
the Middle East.
	   Annan made no mention in his speech of his talks with Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi, whom he met Saturday in Libya to try and
arrange the trial of two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a
Pan Am jet. The bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, killed 270
people.
	   But he later told a news conference in Abu Dhabi: ``We made
positive progress. We're on our way to resolving the issue.'' He
added, ``It will take time, but (we) hope not a lot of time.''

EU pushes ahead with defense plan, with Britain on board
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; with EU-Enlargement, NATO
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Given new impetus by Britain's support,
European Union nations pushed forward Monday with plans to develop
a joint-defense capability that would reduce their military
dependence on the United States.
	   EU foreign ministers considered proposals for European nations
to build up military hardware and create new institutional
arrangements that would empower the 15-nation bloc to tackle
trouble-spots on its doorstep.
	   ``We are discussing how we project military capacity in defense
of our own security,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told
reporters. ``There may be occasion when we want to take part in a
peacekeeping operation or a crisis-management operation where the
Americans don't.''
	   British officials said the next step would be an ``audit'' of
Europe's armed forces to see where action was most needed to
correct weaknesses. They said the lack of large transport aircraft
to rush troops and equipment to flash-points was an obvious
example. Such a review was expected to be concluded in the first
half of 1999.
	   France has long led efforts to give Europe an independent
defense, but British reluctance to endorse initiatives that were
seen as weakening NATO prevented progress.
	   In a recent shift, British Prime Minister Tony Blair believes
the EU nations can work together within the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization as a strengthened ``European pillar,''
shoulder-to-shoulder with the United States.
	   Washington has welcomed that as a move by the Europeans to take
a greater share of the defense burden and reduce the need for U.S.
soldiers to get involved in crises such as those in Bosnia and
Kosovo.
	   To streamline decisionmaking, officials at Monday's EU meeting
said they were considering scrapping the Western European Union
defense group set up in 1950 and instead give EU foreign and
defense ministers new powers to decide security issues.
	   ``Ways of resolving the question include the dissolution of the
Western European Union,'' Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes
told reporters.
	   The European defense debate is likely to be continued at the
EU's summit of government leaders in Vienna, Austria, on Friday and
Saturday, and at a meeting Tuesday of NATO foreign ministers in
Brussels.
	   Austria's Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, whose country
currently holds the EU's rotating presidency, is scheduled to
discuss the issue Tuesday with NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana.
	   The defense moves present particular problems for the EU's four
neutral members, Austria, Sweden, Ireland and Finland. Officials
said a system was being considered to enable them to opt-out of the
defense arrangements.

Carbone scores twice as Wednesday beats Forest 3-2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ Two goals in five minutes by Benito
Carbone helped Sheffield Wednesday to a 3-2 victory over fellow
struggler Nottingham Forest in the Premier League Monday.
	   After Niclas Alexandersson had given Wednesday a 22nd minute
lead, Carbone made it 2-0 eight minutes into the second half.
	   Forest midfielder Thierry Bonalair pulled a goal back two
minutes later but Carbone struck again in the 58th to give
Wednesday a 3-1 lead.
	   Forest's Dutch striker Pierre van Hooijdonk brought it back to
3-2 with 20 minutes to go but Wednesday held on to climb one place
above Everton to 14th in the 20-club league.
	   The loss means that Forest remains next to last above only
Southampton.

Record Australian cocaine haul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Three men and one woman will appear in
Coffs Harbor Local Court on Tuesday charged over Australia's
biggest cocaine haul -- 495 pounds (225 kilos) seized from a yacht.
	   A police spokesman said it was believed the ketch Maeva,
carrying cocaine with an estimated street value of 50 million
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 30 million), had started its journey
in South America.
	   The two Australian men, a Spanish woman, and the British skipper
of the Maeva will face court Tuesday.
	   The drugs seized Monday afternoon had been stored in a dinghy
attached to the vessel, the police spokesman said, adding the bust
followed a six-month undercover operation.
	   It comes two months after federal police, customs and the navy
smashed an
	   international drug ring and recorded Australia's largest ever
drug haul.
	   On October 14, during a pre-dawn raid on a beach on the New
South Wales mid-north coast, south of Port Macquarie, 880 pounds
(400 kilos) of high-grade heroin was seized.
	   Eighteen people, including seven Hong Kong Chinese nationals and
11 Indonesians, were arrested.
	   The previous record cocaine haul was in 1994 when 383 pounds
(174 kilos) were found in the northern Sydney suburb of Artarmon.

Le Pen loyalist rebels as National Front rivalry bursts into open

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 2nd and 8th grafs with third firing. &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In the latest and clearest sign of serious trouble
in the far-right National Front, one of party leader Jean-Marie Le
Pen's loyalists openly defied hz9Monday _ and was immediately
fired.
	   The episode, along with two other firings in the same day,
provided further evidence that the flamboyant leader is losing his
grip on the party he has led for a quarter-century.
	   It came after a tempestuous weekend in which the rivalry between
Le Pen and longtime lieutenant Bruno Megret burst suddenly and
perhaps irrevocably onto the surface.
	   The National Front is virulently anti-immigrant, and has been
widely accused of racism and anti-Semitism.
	   For 27 years, Le Pen has been the movement's absolute leader.
But his increasingly public clashes with the quieter, more
pragmatic Megret have deeply divided the party.
	   On Monday, moments after a news conference in which a longtime
Le Pen loyalist, Serge Martinez, harshly criticized recent actions
by Le Pen, the party leader issued a terse statement.
	   Serge Martinez is ``removed from all his political and
administrative functions with the National Front,'' it said.
	   Le Pen also fired Pierre Vial, another member of the party's
political bureau who had questioned his recent actions, as well as
Denis Daude, who was in charge of training. The motive for Daude's
firing was not made clear.

WASHINGTON: the law.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Reno noted that, in addition to the legal advice, party lawyers
screened every ad before it was broadcast to ensure it met legal
requirements. Under established law, good faith reliance on the
advice of counsel negates criminal intent, she said.
	   Further, Reno said, established department policy requires the
department to defer to the bipartisan Federal Election Commission
for the interpretation of ambiguous election laws. Reno noted that
in a hearing last week, FEC commissioners expressed the view that
the legal standard at the time was ``fuzzy'' and ``hardly clear.''
	   At this time, Reno made no finding on whether the issue
advertisements complied with election laws. The FEC is still
considering, at meetings later this week, whether the ads amounted
to a civil violation of election law.
	   Reno's inquiry was triggered by draft versions of FEC staff
audits that concluded both Clinton and his 1996 Republican
opponent, Bob Dole, committed civil violations of federal spending
limits. The audits recommended Clinton repay the government dlrs 7
million and Dole repay dlrs 17.7 million.
	   The FEC auditors argued that the issue ads, which both Clinton
and Dole personally helped coordinate, went too far and amounted to
advocating the candidate's election. If so, the advertising costs
should have fallen under spending limits Clinton and Dole agreed to
when they accepted public campaign funds, the auditors argued.

Brazil's public sector deficit narrows to 7.0 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's public sector deficit,
considered one of the country's most worrisome financial
indicators, widened slightly in September, the Central Bank said
Monday.
	   The public sector deficit widened to 7 percent of gross domestic
product between January and September, up from 6.4 percent at the
end of August.
	   At the end of September, the country's gross domestic product
stood at 904.49 billion reals (dlrs 760 billion), down slightly
from the 905.39 billion reals (dlrs 761 billion) at at the end of
August, according to Altamir Lopes, the Central Bank's economic
policy director.
	   During the same period Brazil's total public sector debt rose to
39.7 percent of the GDP in September up from 38.8 percent.
	   The public sector deficit corresponds to the difference between
what the government takes in and what it pays out. The public
sector debt is the total amount of money the government owes.
	   Lopes blamed the deteriorating public accounts in September to
the drastic interest rate hikes that occurred in the wake of the
financial crisis spurred by the Russian debt default last August.
	   In September, the Central Bank brought interest rates to nearly
50 percent a year to stem heavy capital outflows.
	   Lopes said that because of continued high interest rates public
accounts results for October and November ``won't be much
brighter.''

WASHINGTON: auditors agreed.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   At an FEC meetings last Thursday, four of the six FEC
commissioners, including two Democrats and two Republicans,
challenged the legal basis for the auditors recommendation.
	   ``Today's determination only ends our probe into whether issue
ads paid for by the Democratic National Committee violated federal
criminal statutes,'' Reno said. ``It does not end our vigorous
investigation into allegations of illegal activity surrounding the
1996 elections.''
	   Reno's 120-person campaign finance task force has charged 14
people over the past two years, including prominent Democratic
donors, but Republicans in Congress have demanded that she turn the
case over to an independent counsel.
	   They remained dissatisfied with her on Monday.
	   ``Janet Reno is failing in her responsibility to investigate the
biggest scandal in Washington, the ongoing bipartisan sale of
influence in return for unlimited campaign contributions,'' said
Republican Chris Shays.

Statehood gets 37 percent in Puerto Rican poll
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Days before a vote on Puerto Rico's
future relationship with the United States, a poll shows support
for U.S. statehood at 37 percent.
	   The survey published by the El Mundo newspaper echoes previous
polls putting support for statehood at less than 40 percent. Island
residents will cast ballots on the issue on Sunday.
	   Twenty-four percent of voters favor the current commonwealth
arrangement, according to the survey published Monday by the El
Mundo newspaper, and 12 percent would vote for ``none of the
above,'' a protest vote supported by the opposition Popular
Democratic Party.
	   Pro-statehooders would win 35 percent of the vote, independence,
3 percent and a loosely defined ``free association,'' 3 percent.
	   The telephone poll of 808 people between Nov. 11 and 30 has a
3.6 percent margin of error.
	   Similar surveys have consistently shown statehood winning the
most votes, but falling short of the 50 percent mark that many U.S.
lawmakers say is needed to spur Congress to resolve the island's
tangled legal ties to the mainland.
	   Under the current commonwealth, Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens
but cannot vote for president and do not have a vote in Congress.
They pay no federal taxes but receive limited federal benefits and
are subject to the military draft.
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello, who advocates statehood, called the
nonbinding vote in July after a bill to redefine Puerto Rico's
political status stalled in the U.S. Senate.

Record Australian cocaine haul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Three men and one woman will appear in
Coffs Harbor Local Court on Tuesday charged over Australia's
biggest cocaine haul -- 495 pounds (225 kilos) seized from a yacht.
	   A police spokesman said it was believed the ketch Maeva,
carrying cocaine with an estimated street value of 50 million
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 30 million), had started its journey
in South America.
	   The two Australian men, a Spanish woman, and the British skipper
of the Maeva will face court Tuesday.
	   The drugs seized Monday afternoon had been stored in a dinghy
attached to the vessel, the police spokesman said, adding the bust
followed a six-month undercover operation.
	   It comes two months after federal police, customs and the navy
smashed an international drug ring and recorded Australia's largest
ever drug haul.
	   On October 14, during a pre-dawn raid on a beach on the New
South Wales mid-north coast, south of Port Macquarie, 880 pounds
(400 kilos) of high-grade heroin was seized.
	   Eighteen people, including seven Hong Kong Chinese nationals and
11 Indonesians, were arrested.
	   The previous record cocaine haul was in 1994 when 383 pounds
(174 kilos) were found in the northern Sydney suburb of Artarmon.

	   BAIE-COMEAU, Quebec (AP) _ A twin-engine plane with 10 people
aboard crashed Monday in shallow, frigid waters near the mouth of
the St. Lawrence River. Three people were rescued, and five bodies
were found by military divers in the wreckage.
	   The other two people remained missing; authorities said their
bodies may have drifted down the river.
	   The three survivors were plucked from atop the fuselage by a
civilian helicopter and taken to the Baie-Comeau hospital. They
reportedly were suffering from fractures and shock.
	   The plane, a Britten-Norman Islander operated by a regional
company called Air Satellite, came to rest in shallow water, with
only its tail sticking above the surface. A rising tide later
covered the tail.
	   Authorities said the plane was carrying a pilot and nine
passengers. A coast guard vessel and rescue aircraft were sent to
the scene.
	   The plane went down about a mile (less than two kilometers) from
Baie-Comeau, on the north shore of the St. Lawrence about 180 miles
(300 kilometers) northeast of Quebec City.
	   There was no immediate indication what caused the crash, which
was witnessed by some people on shore. The regional
search-and-rescue center in Halifax, Nova Scotia, said it was not
aware of any emergency radio calls from the pilot prior to the
crash.
	   Richard Gagne, a Quebec provincial police spokesman, said the
plane crashed shortly after taking off from Baie-Comeau en route to
Rimouksi, on the south side of the river. The St. Lawrence is about
30 miles (50 kilometers) wide at Baie-Comeau.

EU ministers demand close monitoring of Russian food aid.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of EU proposal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union foreign ministers agreed
on principle Monday on a dlrs 460 million food aid deal for Russia,
but insisted on tight controls to ensure the aid reaches the needy,
not profiteers.
	   The ministers said they wanted independent monitoring of the
distribution of the aid package which includes hundreds of millions
of tons of grain, beef, milk powder and other foodstuffs. They also
demanded monthly reports from the Russian authorities.
	   ``In principle we are in favor of giving aid, but a multitude of
questions needs to be answered first,'' said German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer.
	   The EU must take a number of steps before the aid is freed. The
EU's executive Commission is expected to finalize its aid proposal
on Wednesday, EU leaders are likely to give their political backing
at a two-day summit starting Friday, and EU farm ministers will
draw up distribution details Dec. 14.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, who chaired
Monday's meeting, said the aid would be sent gradually and would be
immediately halted if irregularities are discovered.
	   The food aid will be sold in Russia at market prices, and
profits used to fund social projects, Schuessel told reporters.
	   The EU summit in Vienna, Austria, is expected to holder a wider
debate on relations between Russia and the 15-nation European bloc.
	   The EU has been debating the aid package since Nov. 9, four days
after the United States announced it would provide Russia with a
dlrs 600 million food aid package.
	   Russia's worst grain harvest in 40 years, coming on the heels of
the summer's financial collapse have sent prices rising 50 percent
and prompted fears the poor won't be able to afford food through
the winter.

IRA holds `convention' over deadlock in Northern Ireland accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 9-10 with Blair to meet Northern Ireland
politicians &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Leaders of the Irish Republican
Army have met secretly and are likely to make an important policy
statement soon about the tensions troubling Northern Ireland's
peace accord, police in both parts of Ireland said Monday.
	   Senior police in Belfast and Dublin, speaking on condition they
not be identified, said anti-terrorist detectives tracked more than
50 IRA members, including the outlawed group's seven-member ruling
Army Council, to a secret location last weekend in County Cavan
near the Irish Republic's border with British-ruled Northern
Ireland.
	   But the two officers said they didn't know if the question of
disarmament _ so long an obstacle on Northern Ireland's slow road
to peace _ came up for serious debate.
	   All eight party leaders who backed the April peace deal are in
Boston and Washington this week to accept awards saluting that
achievement, but tensions among them have rarely run higher.
	   The agreement envisaged that Protestant and Catholic politicians
would form by October a multi-party administration for Northern
Ireland and agree terms for policy-making committees with the Irish
Republic. Neither step has been taken.
	   Protestant politician David Trimble, the would-be leader of that
administration, has insisted that Sinn Fein can't participate until
the IRA starts to disarm.
	   IRA leaders traditionally draft policy statements in December to
be issued for New Year's Day. Any significant policy changes, such
as cease-fires, require broader sanction from middle-ranking
personnel to minimize the risk of internal feuding.
	   Following previous secret meetings the IRA has rejected all
calls to disarm, although the accord said it and outlawed
pro-British paramilitary groups should destroy their hidden
arsenals by mid-2000.
	   In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said he will hold
a series of talks this week at Downing Street to try to push the
peace process forward.
	   Blair is to meet on Tuesday with John Taylor, deputy leader of
the pro-British Ulster Unionists. On Wednesday he is to meet with
Martin McGuinness, chief negotiator of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein
party, as well as Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, the moderate Catholic party.
	   On Monday, meanwhile, .... pvs graf 9

Nobel Medicine winners excited about their work
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The winners of this year's Nobel
Medicine Prize on Monday eagerly told of the explosive interest in
their discovery and tried to dampen controversy over whether
another researcher should have received it.
	   ``It does everything, but most of what it does we don't
understand,'' said Ferid Murad, one of three Americans who share
the 7.6-million-kronor (dlrs 950,000) prize for their work on
discovering the properties of nitric oxide, which acts as a
blood-vessel dilator.
	   Murad's statement might have sounded like a bit of forgivable
hyperbole amid the high spirits of being in Stockholm for the
presentation of the prize on Thursday. But co-laureate Louis
Ignarro talked in equally superlative terms.
	   ``I've been involved in research for about 30 years and I've
never seen another area explode as this one has,'' he told a news
conference that also included fellow laureate Robert Furchgott.
	   ``There's so many new areas to explore with nitric oxide. ...
Very soon, we'll be able to deal with the causes and novel
therapeutic strategies for coronoary artery disease, for
hypertension, for stroke, for vascular complications with
diabetes,'' he said.
	   Murad added that he believed nitric oxide could soon be applied
to relieving asthma suffering.
	   Ignarro's use of the word ``explode'' resonates deeply in the
Nobel festivities. It was the laureates' research that revealed
that nitroglycerin relieves angina pectoris pains by releasing
nitric oxide, and nitroglycerin is the key ingredient in dynamite,
the explosive invented by Alfred Nobel who established the prizes
in his will.
	   In fact, Nobel's doctor had prescribed him to take
nitroglycerin, but the Swedish inventor was skeptical, not having
the advantage of the prize-winning research.
	   After the prize was announced in October, the decision to
recognize the importance of nitric oxide, whose effects also play a
role in the anti-impotence medicine Viagra, was widely approved of.
But some said Salvador Moncada should have been one of the
laureates.
	   The criticism came from 1984 Nobel Medicine laureate Cesar
Millstein and the medical faculty of the Moncada's alma mater
University of El Salvador, among others.
	   Moncada, now at the Wolfson Institute of the University College
of London, was quoted in the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet
last week as saying the prize was a shock.
	   ``I feel terrifically frustrated about the injustice. It feels
as if my life's work has been stolen from me,'' the newspaper
quoted him as saying.
	   Asked about the controversy, Ignarro said ``the Nobel committee,
as always, have done their homework,'' but praised Moncada as ``a
brilliant scientist who has made some contributions to this area.''
	   The laureates' work ``stimulated an avalanche of research ...
and I would go so far as to say that Dr. Salvador Moncada led this
avalanche.''
	   The bodies that select the various Nobel Prize winners are bound
not to comment on their decision-making processes, other than to
state in citations why they believe the winners are deserving.
	   All the Nobel Prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary
of Nobel's death. The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway, and
the others in Stockholm.
	   This year's peace prize will be awarded to John Hume and David
Trimble for their peace efforts in Northern Ireland. Jose Saramago
of Portugal won the literature prize. The economics prize goes to
Amartya Sen for his work in analyzing the causes behind famines and
other work in the area of welfare economics.
	   Robert Laughlin, Horst Stormer and Daniel Tsui share the physics
prize for discovering how electrons can change behavior. The
chemistry prize, for developing ways of analyzing molecules in
reactions, is shared by John Pople and Walter Kohn.

Ah, to play in the NFC
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Houston Oilers, Pittsburgh Steelers, Oakland
Raiders and Seattle Seahawks have to be looking longingly at the
National Football Conference.
	   Those four teams, the first three 7-6 and the Seahawks 6-7
(thanks to a bad call in Sunday's loss), might be shut out of the
AFC playoffs.
	   In the other conference, where Arizona and New Orleans (both
6-7) are tied for the last wild-card spot, they'd be in the thick
of the race. Instead, Tampa Bay could join the Cardinals and Saints
if it beats Green Bay on Monday night. And even the Giants and
Lions (both 5-8) aren't out of it.
	   That makes the three biggest games left in the regular season
next Sunday night, when the Jets and Dolphins (both 9-4) battle for
the AFC lead; the following Monday night, Dec. 21, when Miami tries
to protect its unbeaten 1972 team against Denver, which has only to
beat the Giants next week to go to 14-0; and Dec. 20, when New
Orleans and Arizona meet with the NFC's last wild-card berth on the
line.
	   But the disparity between the conferences goes beyond that.
	   Right now, the AFC holds a 27-16 edge in head-to-head games,
with the AFC West 12-4 against the NFC East. That's not new _ there
were some years when NFC teams were winning 13 straight Super Bowls
that the AFC actually won the season's series. But in those
seasons, it was because the NFC was top-heavy.
	   From 1984 through 1997, six NFC teams won Super Bowls: the 49ers
(four), Redskins (two), Cowboys (three), Giants (two), Bears and
Packers. But AFC teams stayed competitive by beating up on the
bottom of the NFC _ the Cardinals and Bucs regularly, the Falcons
occasionally, the Cowboys in the late '80s and the Rams since 1989.
	   But this year, even the ``better'' NFC teams have problems with
the AFC.
	   San Francisco, for example, lost in Buffalo _ a game that looked
at the time like a major upset, but looks very different now. One
of Atlanta's two losses is to the Jets, although that can be
partially explained by the absence of Chris Chandler.
	   One of Green Bay's losses is to Pittsburgh, a team struggling on
offense, and Dallas has been beaten by Denver (no surprise) and at
home by Oakland. And the best team in the NFC, Minnesota, has three
more AFC games left _ at home to Jacksonville and at Tennessee and
Baltimore.
	   That doesn't mean, of course, that the AFC will win 13 straight
Super Bowls. It doesn't even mean it will win two _ if Denver and
Minnesota, 25-1 between them, were to meet next week at a neutral
site, the Broncos probably wouldn't be favored by much more than a
field goal.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; PRESSURE POINT: &LR;  Mike Shanahan likes being unbeaten because it
gives his Broncos something to play for _ unlike two seasons ago
when they clinched home field early, had a month with nothing to
gain and ended up being upset at home by Jacksonville in their
first playoff game.
	   But after Denver's last two games, it would seem Shanahan would
want to relieve some of the pressure.
	   Sunday's 35-31 win over the Chiefs was important because it
demonstrated John Elway still has the last-minute touch _ two
touchdown drives in the final 8:25.
	   But it's also clear from the last two games the Broncos are
starting to feel the burden of being unbeaten.
	   Elway threw three interceptions and lost a fumble in the 31-16
win over San Diego a week ago. On Sunday, he threw an interception
on the goal line, and Terrell Davis, who hadn't lost a ball in 836
touches, fumbled at the Kansas City 1-yard line.
	   There's another problem: Teams are especially fired up against
the Broncos.
	   ``I'm glad they're still unbeaten, we want to get them,'' said
defensive end Michael Strahan of the Giants, who are home against
Denver next Sunday.
	   Miami will have two incentives in its next game: its drive for
the AFC East title and protecting the 1972 Dolphins' place as the
only unbeaten team in modern National Football League history.

Traditional demonstrations at La Scala gala night

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Keeping to the tradition of turbulence for
La Scala galas, animal right activists shouted insults at patrons
in furs showing up Monday night for the opera season opening.
	   ``Murderers'' and ``Shame'' were among the shouts from the from
the activists, who waved flags and exploded some firecrackers as
riot policemen forced them behind metal barricades about 50 meters
(yards) from the downtown theater.
	   Two activists managed to reach the foyer but were driven away by
plainclothes policemen.
	   ``There is more drama in the cloak room of this theater than on
the stage,'' shouted Dan Matthews, the American leader of an
animals rights group. Italian socialite Marina Ripa di Meana, a
long-time supporter of animal rights activists, flashed to the
photographers and television cameramen her naked breasts with the
violet inscription ``No Furs.''
	   ``Better naked than in fur,'' said Ripa de Meana. ``It's not
fashion, it's just cruelty.''
	   Another group of protesters shouted political slogans against
the mayor and ``buffoons'' to theatergoers who paid up to dlrs
1,000 a seat for the premiere.
	   Some women left their furs in their limousines and dared
close-to-zero (32F) temperatures as they walked to the theater in
flimsy dresses.
	   Others strode in their fur coats.
	   La Scala opera season was inaugurated with Richard Wagner's
``Gotterdammerung'' conducted by maestro Riccardo Muti.
	   Wolfgang Schmidt, Jane Eaglen and Waltraud Meier, who played the
main roles of the opera sung in German, received five curtain calls
at the end of the nearly six hours long performance.
	   The overall reception was enthusiastic, with the final applause
lasting about 15 minutes.
	   The sellout audience shouted ``Brave,'' ``Brave,'' as Meier, a
German mezzo-soprano who played Waltraute, and, Eaglen, an English
soprano who sang as Brunnhilde, answered the curtain calls while
bouquet of flowers were thrown onto the stage from the boxes.
	   Maestro Muti enjoyed a personal triumph and received a standing
ovation.
	   The opening night of La Scala opera season, on the patron saint
day of St. Ambrose, often has seen vocal protests.
	   Every year since 1968 there have been demonstrations by
students, animal right activists, jobless workers, strikers and
even traffic policemen.

Le Pen loyalist rebels as National Front rivalry bursts into open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 2nd and 8th grafs with fourth firing &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photo
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In the latest and clearest sign of serious trouble
in the far-right National Front, one of party leader Jean-Marie Le
Pen's loyalists openly defied him on Monday _ and was immediately
fired.
	   The episode, along with three other firings in the same day,
provided further evidence that the flamboyant leader is losing his
grip on the party he has led for a quarter-century.
	   It came after a tempestuous weekend in which the rivalry between
Le Pen and longtime lieutenant Bruno Megret burst suddenly, and
perhaps irrevocably, onto the surface.
	   The National Front is virulently anti-immigrant, and has been
widely accused of racism and anti-Semitism.
	   For 27 years, Le Pen has been the movement's absolute leader.
But his increasingly public clashes with the quieter, more
pragmatic Megret have deeply divided the party.
	   On Monday, moments after a news conference in which a longtime
Le Pen loyalist, Serge Martinez, harshly criticized recent actions
by Le Pen, the party leader issued a terse statement.
	   Serge Martinez is ``removed from all his political and
administrative functions with the National Front,'' it said.
	   Le Pen also fired Pierre Vial, another member of the party's
political bureau who had questioned his recent actions, as well as
Denis Daude, who was in charge of training, and Joel Le Nestic, a
regional party official. The motive for firing Daude and Le Nestic
wasn't made clear.

Forecasters say Cyclone Thelma will miss Darwin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with predictions Darwin will be spared brunt of
storm. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ Destructive winds brought by tropical
Cyclone Thelma struck islands off the Northern Territory coast
Tuesday, but weather forecasters said Darwin was expected to escape
the worst of its fury.
	   Thelma was rated a severe category four cyclone, with winds
gusting up to 175 mph (280 kph), as strong as those in Cyclone
Tracy in 1974, and was intensifying.
	   Darwin's Bureau of Meteorology said the destructive core of the
cyclone was 110 miles (180 km) northwest of Darwin, close to the
Tiwi Islands.
	   ``It's a pretty severe cyclone ... it's roughly the same
intensity Cyclone Tracy was,'' senior weather forecaster Andrew
Tupper told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Although Darwin had been warned it may be hit by destructive
gale force winds, the cyclone was expected to miss the city,
forecasters said.
	   Bureau spokesman Ian Shepherd said Thelma was not expected to
cross the coast.
	   ``On its present track, it's going to pass Darwin by quite a
large range,'' Shepherd said.
	   ``By this evening the winds should have passed Darwin,'' he
said.
	   Shepherd said Thelma was not the only major cyclone that has
come close to Darwin since Cyclone Tracy devastated the Northern
Territory capital at Christmas in 1974.
	   Shepherd said Cyclone Neville in April 1992 was in a similar
position to where Thelma was early Tuesday, but that, too, moved
away towards the southwest.
	   In the Tiwi Islands, most residents had left their homes for
community shelters.
	   Police said there had been power failure and some trees down on
the Tiwi Islands, but there had been no reports of any injuries
among the islands' 2,000 people.
	   The power was down and some houses were damaged on the north
coast of Melville Island, just north of Darwin, police said.

Lens loses appeal over Vairelles suspension
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ UEFA on Monday rejected an appeal by French
champion Lens against a suspension imposed on winger Tony
Vairelles.
	   Vairelles was given the one-match suspension for ``unsporting
behavior'' during Lens' 1-0 Champions League win against Arsenal at
Wembley last month.
	   UEFA's appeals body rejected the protest by Lens, ruling that
suspensions of up to two matches can't be appealed.
	   Arsenal midfielder Ray Parlour was sent off in the final minute
for striking out at Cyril Rool. He was followed a minute later by
Vairelles for a foul challenge on Lee Dixon.
	   Although Dixon was not booked by referee Anders Frisk, UEFA
ruled he started the trouble by elbowing Vairelles in the back.
	   Parlour and Dixon were suspended for at least one European
match.

of a World Bank team for more loan talks did little to assuage
fears that Russia will be left without foreign aid.
	   The ruble rate has been the main indicator of economic
confidence since Russian financial markets were virtually wiped out
in August, and its fall reflected fears that Russia will begin
printing large sums of money to pay off its debts and cover the

	   _ Magnus Norman, Magnus Gustafsson, Jonas Bjorkman and Nicklas
Kulti teamed to lead Sweden to the Davis Cup title, defeating Italy
4-1 in Milan, Italy.
	   _ Alex Corretja beat Carlos Moya in the final of the Spanish
national championships 6-7 (4-7), 7-5, 6-4 in La Coruna, Spain.
	   _ John McEnroe won the Honda Challenge in London, defeating
Yannick Noah 7-5, 6-3.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SPEAKING &QC; 
	   ``It's just an unbelievable feeling to win it for your
country.'' _ Nicklas Kulti, after helping lead Sweden to its
seventh Davis Cup title.
	   ``Sweden really cares about the Davis Cup. That is certainly a
strength.'' _ Italian Davis Cup captain Paolo Bertolucci.
	   ``I'm not knocking Pete (Sampras), but just sit back for a
minute and have a look at the two records. Pete has 11 Grand Slams
and two Davis Cups. (Roy) Emerson has 12 Grand Slams and eight
Davis Cup final wins on his record. So how would you compare the
two?'' _ ITF president Brian Tobin, comparing the two.
	   ``I'm not stupid. This sport has given me a lot and I think the
players respect me.'' _ John McEnroe, announcing he is considering
running for president of the International Tennis Federation.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SWEDISH DOMINATION &QC; 
	   When Sweden defeated Italy on an indoor clay court in Milan, the
Scandinavians captured their second straight Davis Cup title, their
third triumph since 1994 and seventh overall. and the Swedes did it
without their two best clay-courters: 17th-ranked Thomas Johansson
and No. 22 Thomas Enqvist are both injured.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SENIOR MAC &QC; 
	   John McEnroe won his 20th consecutive match and second straight
Honda Challenge when he beat Yannick Noah 7-5, 6-3 in Olympia Grand
Hall in London. It was McEnroe's fifth consecutive seniors title
and his eight crown this year as he supplanted Jimmy Connors atop
the Nuveen Masters standings.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; STEFFI'S FOUNDATION &QC; 
	   Steffi Graf has begun an international foundation for
traumatized children, dubbed ``Children for Tomorrow.'' The
foundation is designed to aid children suffering from depression or
psychological trauma resulting from war, persecution or violence.
Graf says her foundation will first concentrate its efforts on
Africa.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SAME FACES &QC; 
	   Alex Corretja and Carlos Moya have met three times in 1998, and
each time has been for a big title. In May, Moya won in the final
of the French Open. Last month, Corretja defeated his fellow
Spaniard in the title match of the ATP Tour World Championships in
Hanover, Germany. Now, Corretja has won again, this time in La
Coruna, Spain. The come-from-behind victory gave Moya the Spanish
national title.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SIP OF THE BUBBLY &QC; 
	   Yannick Noah always has played tennis with a touch of class.
During his round-round match against Pat Cash during the Honda
Challenge senior tournament in London, Noah's dash to reach a ball
carried him into the stands, where he picked up a glass of
champagne and took a sip before continuing play. Noah won 6-7
(6-8), 7-6 (8-6), 10-8.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SEVERE BLOW &QC; 
	   India's gold medal prospects at the Asian Games suffered a
severe blow when tennis star Leander Paes withdrew with an ankle
injury. Paes, ranked fourth in the world in doubles, suffered the
injury during the World Doubles Championships in Hartford, Conn.,
last month. Asia's top-ranked player, Paes was seeking three gold
medals in the team, singles and doubles.

U.S. Virgin Islands governor asks for loan to fix year 2000 bug
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Gov. Roy Schneider
is asking U.S. Virgin Islands lawmakers to allow a dlrs 32.4
million loan to fix the year 2000 bug in government computers.
	   In a letter to legislative leaders Monday, Schneider warned the
problem could paralyze computers with ``meaningless, or worse,
erroneous, calculations.''
	   The problem stems from software and hardware that only uses two
digits to designate years in dates. When 2000 arrives, computer
experts warn many older systems could mistake the date for 1900.
	   Schneider said Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and IBM Corp. have
submitted loan offers with repayment schedules of 10 years and
seven years, respectively.
	   Debt on the 10-year loan would range from a maximum of dlrs 5.8
million in fiscal year 2001 to dlrs 835,000 in fiscal year 2010 if
interest rates remain the same.
	   The loan would be secured by property taxes paid by a refinery
to be built in St. Croix by Hess Oil of the Virgin Islands and
Petroleos de Venezuela.
	   The request comes only weeks before Schneider steps down to make
way for governor-elect Charles Turnbull.
	   Senate President Lorraine Berry said the legislature would
likely not consider the bill before the end of 1998.

Pediatricians' group recommends diarrhea immunization

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The largest pediatricians' group in the United
States says all U.S. infants should be vaccinated against the
leading cause of diarrhea, an illness that each year causes 55,000
hospitalizations, kills 40 children, and costs dlrs 400 million.
	   Though costly, the three-dose vaccine against rotavirus, an
intestinal infection, should prevent thousands of American
preschoolers from suffering severe diarrhea, health officials
believe. The vaccine costs dlrs 38 per dose wholesale.
	   ``In order to protect against the large number of children who
need to be hospitalized, we need to give the vaccine to
everybody,'' Dr. Neal A. Halsey of the American Academy of
Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said
Monday.
	   The vaccine promises to reduce by up to 80 percent the worst
cases of diarrhea caused by rotaviruses. In the most severe, a
child can experience 10 to 20 episodes of diarrhea in a single day,
quickly getting dangerously dehydrated.
	   Good health care limits rotavirus-caused deaths in this country
to no more than 40 a year. But 3 million American children are
sickened by rotavirus annually. In developing countries with poor
health care, rotavirus kills about 1 million children a year.
	   Doses of the vaccine, which are squirted from a dropper into a
baby's mouth, are recommended at ages 2 months, 4 months and 6
months.

Surprise weapons insections to begin Tuesday

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors will begin a
series of surprise inspections in Iraq on Tuesday in a final test
of whether Baghdad is cooperating fully in the search for banned
weapons, chief inspector Richard Butler said Monday.
	   After the no-notice inspections are finished late this week or
early next week, Butler said he will prepare a report for U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on whether or not Iraq has kept its
Nov. 14 promise to resume unconditional cooperation with the
inspector.
	   Annan will then report to the Security Council, which must
decide that Iraq is in full cooperation with inspectors before it
will undertake a comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with
U.N. resolutions.
	   Iraqi leaders see the review as the quickest route to easing or
lifting economic sanctions, but diplomats say it will merely
establish a list of Baghdad's outstanding obligations _ and the
United States insists there is no link to ending sanctions.
	   Iraq curtailed the work of the U.N. Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM, which is charged with verifying the destruction of its
weapons of mass destruction, on Aug. 5, and completely shut down
inspections Oct. 31.
	   Iraqi leaders reversed course Nov. 14 in the face of U.S.
airstrikes, and promised to give inspectors unfettered access to
all sites and documents related to its programs to develop nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Since the weapons inspectors returned, they have been testing
Iraq's promise, seeking access to documents, interviewing Iraqi
weapons experts and monitoring previously inspected sites to make
sure dual-use equipment is not used for banned weapons purpose.
	   Butler said the senior weapons inspector in Baghdad had informed
Iraq's National Monitoring Directorate on Monday that the surprise
inspections were about to begin.
	   ``They're about to start a series of inspections which will be
the last piece for us to test whether or not Iraq has kept its
promise of full cooperation,'' Butler said. ``These are surprise
inspections.''
	   UNSCOM must certify that Iraq has eliminated its nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons and long-range missiles before
economic sanctions imposed after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait
can be lifted.

U.N. General Assembly approves Cambodia seat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Cambodian minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. General Assembly gave Cambodia's
seat in the world body to the new coalition government Monday after
a 15-month vacancy, but no representative was in the chamber to sit
in the country's chair.
	   Forty-five minutes later, Cambodia's minister of state for
foreign affairs, Hor Namhong, showed up and expressed his country's
happiness at taking its place once again ``in this great United
Nations family.''
	   He expressed hope that Cambodia will be able to join the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations in time for the regional
grouping's Dec. 15-16 summit in Hanoi.
	   ``It is time to join together without exception to build
Southeast Asia into a region of peace, stability and prosperity,''
he said.
	   Vietnam strongly supports Cambodia's bid, but Singapore and the
Philippines have signaled that the troubled nation should prove
that its new government is stable before gaining entry.
	   Without a vote, the General Assembly approved by consensus the
Credentials Committee's decision Friday to give Cambodia's seat to
the coalition led by Hun Sen.
	   Cambodia's seat was left empty after Hun Sen's July 1997 ouster
of co-prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh in a violent coup.
	   Supporters of both men presented competing claims for the
country's seat after the coup and the Credentials Committee decided
in September 1997 to keep the seat vacant.
	   The panel again deferred a decision last October after Ranariddh
and his political allies disputed Hun Sen's narrow victory in a
July election and blocked formation of a new government.
	   Ranariddh bowed to international pressure last month and struck
a coalition deal in which Hun Sen became prime minister and the
prince was named president of the National Assembly.
	   Hor told the General Assembly that Cambodia will cooperate with
the United Nations ``to reinforce peace, democracy and human rights
respect.''
	   He announced that Cambodia will extend the office of the United
Nations Human Rights Center in Phnom Penh until the year 2000. Its
mandate is to assist the government to improve all conditions
connected with respect for human rights.
	   Cambodia also wants to widen cooperation with the U.N.
Development Program and other specialized agencies to enhance its
economic and social development, Hor said.
	   ``It is true that the road that is leading us to a bright future
is still long, painful and full of obstacles. However, it is also
full of hope and the desire to see our country rejoin the place
that it deserves in the concert of nations, to progress and
develop,'' he said.

Lilly deal may put off generic inroads of the popular drug Prozac

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ A new and improved Prozac could make generic
drug companies depressed.
	   Eli Lilly and Co. on Monday said it will pay a small drug
company dlrs 90 million plus sales royalties for the rights to a
modified version of the depression drug Prozac. The new drug
promises a more effective treatment for depression without some
troubling side effects such as sexual dysfunction.
	   The deal might allow Lilly to retain its lucrative franchise on
Prozac even if generic versions hit the market when the drug's main
patent expires in 2003. Lilly could move doctors from prescribing
the old Prozac to the new Prozac, and keep its price stable,
analysts said.
	   That's bad news for generic drugmakers who make copies of drugs
with expired patents and sell them for a fraction of the cost. In
this case, the copies would be of an inferior version of the drug.
	   ``It's spells gloom, with a capital G,'' said Neil Sweig, an
analyst with Southeast Research Partners. ``What is the generic
industry all about but waiting in eager anticipation, with baited
breath, for the major drugs of the world to come off patent?''
	   Independent analyst Hemant K. Shah said the deal keeps Lilly in
great shape. ``They will be in position to shift the market
share,'' Shah said.
	   Prozac is one of the most successful drugs of all time. Even
though it has several competitors, the drug still generates nearly
dlrs 3 billion a year in sales, almost one-third of Lilly's total
sales.
	   Lilly's partner in the deal, Sepracor Inc. of Marlborough,
Massachusetts, is carving out an industry niche for taking the
existing active ingredients in best-selling drugs and improving
them by making them more effective or eliminating harmful side
effects. Sepracor holds patents for about 40 purified versions of
drugs. The new Prozac patent is valid until 2015.
	   The licensing deal is the most lucrative ever for Sepracor, a
14-year-old company with just dlrs 20 million in revenues last
year.
	   Lilly said it is on target to submit the new drug for approval
by the U.S.Food and Drug Administration in 2001.

Report: North Korea building three underground launch facilities
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With UN-North Korea &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea is developing three underground
facilities capable of launching ballistic missiles, Japan's public
broadcaster reported Tuesday.
	   U.S. spy satellites have confirmed what appear to be three
missile-launch bases under construction in the northern part of
North Korea, NHK television quoted Japanese Defense Agency sources
as saying.
	   The three facilities are being built at varying depths ranging
from 50 meters (562 feet) to 100 meters (1,125 feet) below ground,
the report said.
	   A Defense Agency spokesman contacted by the Associated Press had
no comment. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The report comes as former U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry,
the newly appointed U.S. government policy coordinator for North
Korea, is on a three-nation Asian tour.
	   On Monday, Perry met South Korean President Kim Dae-jung in
Seoul. Kim proposed a ``package deal,'' in which the United States
would provide economic and diplomatic benefits to North Korea in
exchange for access to a suspected nuclear weapons site. Perry
plans to visit Tokyo and Beijing later this week.
	   Under a 1994 agreement with the United States, North Korea
agreed to abandon its suspect nuclear weapons program. In return,
it is to receive two safe nuclear reactors worth dlrs 4.6 billion
plus substitute fuel oil and other economic benefits.
	   The U.S. military believes it will be difficult for U.S.
Intelligence satellites to monitor the North's underground missile
facilities if they are completed, NHK reported.
	   The report said a fuel storage facility will be completed in one
or two years at one of the underground sites, where work is
advancing the fastest.
	   Japanese were unnerved by the firing of a rocket by North Korea
on Aug. 31. U.S. and South Korean officials say North Korea test
fired its Taepo Dong-1 missile, which flew over Japan and landed in
the Pacific Ocean, proving the communist country can strike any
part of the nation.
	   North Korea has refused to accept a U.S. demand for outside
inspections of the suspected underground nuclear facility under
construction at Keumjang-ri, 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of
the North's main nuclear complex at Yongbyon.
	   U.S. spy satellite photographs taken earlier this year showed
thousands of North Korean workers burrowing into a mountainside at
the site, raising suspicion that the facility may be
nuclear-related.

Opponents, not pressure, taking toll on Broncos
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AARON J. LOPEZ &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ The Denver Broncos have a perfect record, an
18-game winning streak and the rapt attention of the 1972 Miami
Dolphins.
	   ``We've got a lot to lose,'' Broncos defensive end Harald
Hasselbach said Monday.
	   The Broncos (13-0) have clinched home-field advantage through
the AFC playoffs and are on the verge of clinching a spot in
history as one of the National Football League's greatest teams.
	   ``I think we've got more to lose than any other team,''
Hasselbach said. ``I know what we expect of ourselves, and anything
short of that would just be a failure, so we're going to do
everything in our power to ensure that doesn't happen.''
	   A road win Sunday against the New York Giants (5-8) would give
Denver the record for consecutive overall victories, spanning the
1997 regular season and playoffs and the first 13 games of 1998.
	   ``People ask me what type of incentive do you have since you do
have home-field advantage and since you have clinched the AFC
West,'' Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. ``My No. 1 goal would be
to win 19 in a row.''
	   Denver's streak, which began last Dec. 22 against San Diego,
nearly came to an end Sunday before John Elway led a fourth-quarter
rally that gave the Broncos a 35-31 win over the Kansas City
Chiefs.
	   The victory came despite three Denver turnovers, a botched punt,
a blocked field goal and several key penalties, raising the
question of whether the quest to go unbeaten is taking its toll.
	   The Broncos are not willing to go that far.
	   ``What you're starting to see is more teams are starting to play
their best games against us as we get closer to this history-making
thing,'' cornerback Darrien Gordon said.
	   ``More teams are going to look at this as their Super Bowl, and
I think from here on out every team is just going to try to do
whatever they can do to get a win against us.''
	   While opposing teams seem to draw motivation from playing the
defending Super Bowl champions, that reasoning carries only so much
weight with Shanahan.
	   ``You can't be lulled to sleep,'' he said. ``Since you win a
game by having those turnovers, you can't think you'll always win
doing that and even win in the playoffs. So even though it was nice
to win, we'll address the areas of concern that we had.''
	   The miscues have become more pronounced of late. The Broncos had
nine turnovers in their first 11 games, but have committed seven in
the last two weeks against San Diego and Kansas City.
	   Already in elite company _ only the 1934 Chicago Bears and the
'72 Dolphins went 13-0 to start a season _ the Broncos can add to
their impressive 1998 accomplishments against the Giants.
	   Denver's 18 straight wins are equaled only by San Francisco
(1989-90), Miami (1972-73) and Chicago (1941-42 and 1933-34).
Coincidentally, it was the Giants who ended the Bears' streak in
1934.

Preliminary inquiry begins in killing of British tourist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Bahamian lawyers have began debating in
court which evidence can be presented in the trial of 19-year-old
Terrell Anton McIntosh, who is accused of killing of a British
tourist.
	   As McIntosh's mother, the only spectator, looked on, lawyers on
Monday wrangled over the details of the upcoming trial before a
magistrate judge who will decide which information can be presented
as evidence. Under Bahamian law, details of preliminary inquiry
cannot be publicized.
	   McIntosh is also charged with killing Lori Fogelman, a
schoolteacher from Virginia along the same Cabbage Beach where
Clarke's body was found Aug. 21. The popular tourist beach is on
Paradise Island, a resort area off Nassau.
	   Preliminary hearings into Fogelman's death began Nov. 23 and
ended last week, but no court rulings have been issued.
	   McIntosh is being tried separately for each murder.
	   McIntosh is charged with killing Fogelman sometime between
Monday, July 20 and Saturday, August 22. He is also charged with
the theft of two handbags and dlrs 110 cash.
	   Prosecutors claim he raped and killed Clarke on August 20, then
stole her camera and dlrs 450 in traveler's checks.

	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ The new Museum of Scotland on Monday
set its sights on a letter written by Scottish hero William Wallace
that was discovered recently in Germany.
	   The 13th century letter, discovered in the German city of
Lubeck, is considered invaluable to the museum because so far it is
the only authenticated object associated with Wallace, whose life
was the inspiration for the hit movie, ``Braveheart.''
	   The museum, which opened in Edinburgh last week, will seek a
copy or a loan of the letter, written in Latin following Wallace's
victory over the English at the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297.
	   It notifies the people of north Germany that Scotland is free
from the ``power of the English'' and invites them to reopen trade
routes through Scottish ports.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie made their stage
debut in a surprise performance to raise money for a children's
charity.
	   The daughters of Prince Andrew and Sarah, the Duchess of York,
danced with the Natalie Vincent Ballet School on Sunday to support
Children in Crisis.
	   Beatrice, 10, and Eugenie, 8, were dressed in matching pink
tops, blue skirts and ballet shoes. They practiced for a couple of
months.
	   ``It was genuinely their idea,'' said presenter Jeremy Beadle.
``It's the first time the two princesses and their friends have
ever performed in public.''
	   Officials hoped to raise dlrs 160,000 for the charity, which the
duchess helped found in 1993.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Worldwide celebrations marking the 50th
anniversary of the U.N. human rights declaration has the Dalai Lama
encouraged.
	   ``Some governments have contended that the standards of human
rights laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are
those advocated by the West and do not apply to Asia and other
parts of the Third World because of differences in culture, social
and economic development,'' he said Monday in a statement, without
directly mentioning China.
	   ``I do not share this view and I am convinced that the majority
of ordinary people do not support it either.''
	   The Dalai Lama, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize, has led a
campaign seeking greater autonomy for Tibet within China. He
accuses China of trying to smother the Tibetans' language and
culture. Beijing denies it and says the Dalai Lama is trying to
split China.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval became a U.S.
citizen on Monday, eight years after defecting from Cuba while on
tour with Dizzy Gillespie.
	   ``I never wished to have to escape from my own land,'' said
Sandoval, who was granted political asylum in 1990. ``It does not
make me feel happy to give up my own citizenship.''
	   The swearing-in ceremony marked the end of a two-year battle to
become a citizen. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
initially told Sandoval that citizenship applicants would be turned
down if they had been members of the Communist Party within 10
years of their request.
	   Sandoval now tours the world, playing Latin jazz.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MALIBU, California (AP) _ Robert Downey Jr. won praise from a
judge Monday for making progress in drug rehabilitation but still
has to complete his 100 hours of community service.
	   ``You're doing a lot better than you did in the past,''
Municipal Judge Lawrence Mira said during a hearing. ``You look
great and you seem to be doing well. Keep up the good work.''
	   Mira gave Downey six months to complete his community service.
	   The star of ``Chaplin,'' ``Less Than Zero'' and ``Natural Born
Killers'' appeared in court clean-shaven and wearing a dark suit
and tie.
	   ``I'm just glad to be well. I'm doing real well. I've never felt
better and actually I'm glad he (the judge) agrees,'' Downey said
outside court.
	   Downey was stopped for speeding in 1996 and authorities found
cocaine, heroin and a pistol in his vehicle. His probation was
revoked and he was sentenced to six months in jail. He was released
in March after 113 days.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Hundreds of millions of children are growing up
unequipped to build decent lives because they are denied quality
basic education _ caught in a crisis that endangers world peace,
the United Nations children's agency said Tuesday.
	   Forty percent of elementary school-aged children in developing
countries either never enter school or drop out before they learn
to read, write and count, UNICEF's executive director Carol Bellamy
said in a new report.
	   In many industrialized countries, 15-20 percent of children
leave school without the skills necessary for finding and keeping a
job.
	   Nearly a sixth of humanity _ almost a billion people, will enter
the 21st century unable to read a book or sign their names, much
less operate a computer or understand a simple application form.
And two-thirds of them will be women, the report said.
	   ``The consequences of illiteracy are profound _ and even
potentially life-threatening,'' Bellamy said. ``For millions and
millions of children, education is literally a matter of life and
death.''
	   Citing findings gathered from throughout the developing world,
UNICEF said there is a direct correlation between years of
schooling and the death rates of infants and mothers in childbirth.
	   Children who grow up without basic education find it harder to
support themselves and their families. At its most basic, education
helps people learn how to achieve fundamental human rights, such as
health, nutrition and safe motherhood, but it also helps adults and
children learn to manage conflict, to respect diversity in society
and to work with others, the report said.
	   ``On a society-wide scale, the denial of education harms the
cause of democracy and social progress and, by extension,
international peace and security,'' the report said.
	   Many countries still lack the political will to make education a
priority, Bellamy said.
	   Asia and Latin America in particular have seen significant
improvements over the last decade, but vast disparities between the
haves and have-nots still exist there, Bellamy said.
	   The report highlighted schools and countries that have found
ways to reach more children.
	   For instance, in the Philippines, itinerant teachers with
backpacks take school to children in the most rugged provinces. In
Cambodia, teachers from different villages share materials, and
school by radio is used in the Dominican Republic, Nepal and
Nicaragua.
	   The report concluded that the obligation to ensure all children
have access to quality education _ a human right under the 1989
Convention on the Rights of the Child _ lies primarily with
national governments.
	   ``To achieve education for all children, the world would need to
spend an additional dlrs 7 billion per year over the next 10
years,'' the report said. ``This is less than is annually spent on
cosmetics in the United States or on ice cream in Europe.''
	   ``There has not been sufficient political will,'' the report
said.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors will begin a
series of surprise inspections in Iraq on Tuesday in a final test
of whether Baghdad is cooperating fully in the search for banned
weapons, chief inspector Richard Butler said. After the no-notice
inspections are finished late this week or early next week, Butler
also said Tuesday that he will prepare a report for U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on whether or not Iraq has kept its
Nov. 14 promise to resume unconditional cooperation with the
inspector. Annan will then report to the Security Council, which
must decide that Iraq is in full cooperation with inspectors before
it will undertake a comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with
U.N. resolutions. Iraqi leaders see the review as the quickest
route to easing or lifting economic sanctions, but diplomats say it
will merely establish a list of Baghdad's outstanding obligations _
and the United States insists there is no link to ending sanctions.
(UN-IRAQ)
	   JERUSALEM _ Palestinian police opened fire Monday on rioters
protesting Israel's refusal to release Palestinian prisoners _ the
first sign that the Palestinian police were containing violence in
advance of President Bill Clinton's visit this week. In the West
Bank city of Nablus, Palestinian police fired from rooftops onto
some 3,000 Palestinians, mostly bystanders who had gathered to
watch the rioting. Witnesses said at least five people were
wounded. A Jewish settler driving near the city of Jenin, also in
the northern West Bank, was shot and wounded from gunfire towards
his car, the Israeli army said. The settler, a resident of the
nearby settlement of Ganim, managed to drive to an Israeli army
outpost several kilometers (miles) away and was taken from there to
a hospital in Afula, Israel. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Efforts to forge a political solution for
Kosovo appeared stalemated on Monday after the chief ethnic
Albanian negotiator rejected the latest American plan for the
troubled province. Fehmi Agani said the new U.S. draft for a
political settlement in the majority Albanian province was too
close to the views of Serbia. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the
main republic of Yugoslavia. Most ethnic Albanians, however, want
independence or substantial self-rule. Speaking to reporters in the
provincial capital Pristina, Agani blasted the American draft as
``unacceptable'' and said it could not be ``considered a basis for
... future negotiations.'' The United States is leading diplomatic
efforts to hammer out a solution which would be acceptable both to
independence-seeking ethnic Albanians and to the Serbian regime
which wants to keep control over Kosovo. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angolan government jets bombarded the
central highland strongholds of the rebel group UNITA on Monday,
while infantry units supported by tanks advanced by road, a UNITA
spokesman said. UNITA Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba Gato said at
least 10 people were killed and about 50 were injured in the
attacks which appeared to end the southwest African country's
fragile four-year peace process. The government has refused to say
whether it is attacking the rebel bases. However, the Defense
Ministry will not let reporters into the area because it says it is
an ``operational zone.'' The government and UNITA have engaged in
skirmishes in rural areas of this vast country in recent months,
although both sides refuse to admit responsibility for ending the
peace accord. (ANGOLA-FIGHTING)
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Two astronauts floated out into the
vacuum of space Monday to hook up 40 electrical connections between
the first two pieces of the international space station. It was the
hardest and most important job of their careers. The work called
for Jerry Ross, NASA's most experienced spacewalker, and James
Newman to clamp together the connectors for power and data flow.
The spacewalk, the first of three scheduled for this week, was
expected to last 6 1/2 hours. On Sunday, Endeavour's crew used the
shuttle's robot arm and thruster rockets to snap together the
Russian-made piece, Zarya, and the American-built component, Unity,
forming a seven-story tower in Endeavour's cargo bay. Construction
of the space station hinges on making the hookups, warned NASA's
lead flight director, Bob Castle. Unity, a connecting passageway,
needs the solar power generated by the Zarya control module to
survive. (US-SPACE STATION)

Forecasters say Cyclone Thelma will miss Darwin

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ Destructive winds brought by tropical
Cyclone Thelma struck islands off the Northern Territory coast
Tuesday, but weather forecasters said Darwin was expected to escape
the worst of its fury.
	   Thelma was rated a severe category four cyclone, with winds
gusting up to 175 mph (280 kph), as strong as those in Cyclone
Tracy in 1974, and was intensifying.
	   Darwin's Bureau of Meteorology said the destructive core of the
cyclone was 110 miles (180 km) northwest of Darwin, close to the
Tiwi Islands.
	   ``It's a pretty severe cyclone ... it's roughly the same
intensity Cyclone Tracy was,'' senior weather forecaster Andrew
Tupper told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Although Darwin had been warned it may be hit by destructive
gale force winds, the cyclone was expected to miss the city,
forecasters said.
	   Bureau spokesman Ian Shepherd said Thelma was not expected to
cross the coast.
	   ``On its present track, it's going to pass Darwin by quite a
large range,'' Shepherd said.
	   ``By this evening the winds should have passed Darwin,'' he
said.
	   Shepherd said Thelma was not the only major cyclone that has
come close to Darwin since Cyclone Tracy devastated the Northern
Territory capital at Christmas in 1974.
	   Shepherd said Cyclone Neville in April 1992 was in a similar
position to where Thelma was early Tuesday, but that, too, moved
away towards the southwest.
	   In the Tiwi Islands, most residents had left their homes for
community shelters.
	   Police said there had been power failure and some trees down on
the Tiwi Islands, but there had been no reports of any injuries
among the islands' 2,000 people.
	   The power was down and some houses were damaged on the north
coast of Melville Island, just north of Darwin, police said.

	   A summary of the main points in UNICEF's report on education and
children:
	   _ 130 million, or 21 percent, of children between the ages of 6
and 11 in developing countries are not in school
	   _ 73 million of those _ nearly two thirds _ are girls
	   _ Another 150 million do not complete 5th grade
	   _ Nearly one sixth of humanity _ 855 million people _ will be
illiterate at the end of this century
	   _ Between 1989 and 1994, the proportion of World Bank lending
allocated to education rose from 4.5 percent to 10.4 percent. By
1997, it had fallen to 4.8 percent. The estimate for 1998 is 8.6
percent.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ In an unofficial referendum the residents of a
northern jungle city have protested a peace agreement with
neighboring Ecuador and voted to establish an autonomous regional
government in Peru's largest department.
	   More than 97 percent of the voters in the jungle city of
Iquitos, 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) northeast of Lima, voted
Sunday to immediately establish an autonomous regional government
in the department of Loreto and to elect their own regional
authorities.
	   The vote, which is not legally binding, is the most recent act
of protest against the peace accord signed between Peru and Ecuador
in Ocotber.
	   More than 97 percent of the voters in this department capital
also cast votes Sunday declaring their opposition to the peace
accords, which ended a border conflict with Ecuador dating back to
1943.
	   The agreements granted Ecuador free navigation rights along
rivers in the Amazon as well as rights to establish two product
assembly and storage complexes in Loreto.
	   On Oct. 24, massive street protests in Iquitos against the peace
accords turned violent leaving five people dead.
	   A month later, the city's residents held a 48-hour general
strike to protest the peace accord. ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A volcano towering near Mexico City sent
bursts of steam high into the air Monday and had what officials
described as an explosion that launched ash 2 1/2 miles (4 kms)
above the crater.
	   Lava streamed out of the Popocatepetl Volcano during the
explosion Monday morning, according to the National Disaster
Prevention Center.
	   The volcano, whose name means ``Smoking Mountain'' in the Aztec
language, has been emitting bursts of steam and ash in recent
weeks, causing alarm but no reported damage.
	   The 18,000-foot (5,490-meter) volcano is just 50 miles (80 kms)
southeast of Mexico City, and 300,000 people live on its slopes.
About 15 million people live within a 50-mile (80-km) radius of the
volcano, which has been active since 1994 and regularly emits gas
and steam. ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Colombia's president told Mexican lawmakers
Monday that only economic reform will eradicate their country's
widespread poverty and what he called the consequences of that
poverty: drug smuggling and guerrilla warfare.
	   ``Employment is the new name for peace,'' Andres Pastrana said
in a rousing speech before the Mexican senate that prompted an
unusual standing ovation from senators.
	   Pastrana, who is on an official four-day visit to Mexico, said
Mexico's economic problems, which include rising poverty and
unemployment, are common to all Latin American nations.
	   Pastrana and his wife, Nohra Puyana, spent the weekend at the
Pacific coast resort of Huatulco before flying to Mexico City, and
held a meeting with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo Monday
morning.

Expert says knife in Bermuda trial similar to ones in suspect's
</HEADLINE>
home &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ A knife recovered from the water near
where Rebecca Middleton was killed could be linked to other knives
found at the home of the man charged with her murder, an expert
said Monday.
	   Miami police analyst Robert Hart testified that the knife found
in eight feet (2{ meters) of water near a road bridge was of the
same size, shape and manufacturer as a box of steak knives found at
the home of Justis Smith, the accused.
	   But he added that he didn't know how many knives of that type
were made, and had no information about other designs.
	   ``I am not saying that this knife came from this box,'' Hart
said.
	   Smith, 19, pleaded not guilty to premeditated murder of the
vacationing teen from Belleville, Ontario,
	   Middleton, 17, was found sexually assaulted and stabbed to death
on a quiet road at a Bermuda picnic spot on July 3, 1996. She was
slain after a night out in nearby St. George's with her best
friend, also from Belleville, Ontario.
	   Prosecutors allege that Middleton was killed after accepting a
ride on a motorcycle from Smith and Kirk Mundy. Mundy is serving
five years in prison after pleading guilty to being an accessory
after the fact.
	   Earlier, U.S. forensic examiner Michael Kelley said cuts on
Middleton's clothing could not be pinned down to a particular
weapon.
	   But Kelley said that a slashed bra did have a cut that was
consistent with a serrated knife. And eight of the cuts to
Middleton's heavily bloodstained shirt were of the same size and
shape as the knife found in the water.
	   Further forensic evidence indicated that Mundy's DNA was found
on Middleton and her panties, but no DNA from Smith was found.
	   The trial continues Tuesday.

U.S. vows to keep trying on formula for Kosovo peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs.
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The United States is pledging to
keep working on a formula for the future of embattled Kosovo
province after the chief ethnic Albanian negotiator rejected the
latest U.S. plan.
	   Fehmi Agani said the new U.S. formula for the future of the
majority Albanian province was ``unacceptable'' because it was too
close to the views of Serbia. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the
main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Agani told reporters Monday that the latest American draft could
not be ``considered a basis for ... future negotiations.''
	   Following Agani's announcement, White House spokesman David
Leavy said the Clinton administration was ``determined to push for
a political settlement that will bring autonomy to Kosovo.''
	   Leavy said in Washington that the administration would keep
working on a formula to return to the kind of autonomy the province
had until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic canceled it a
decade ago.
	   That formula, however, may no longer satisfy ethnic Albanians,
many of whom were radicalized by the bloody Serb crackdown on the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence.
	   Hundreds were killed and almost 300,000 ethnic Albanians
displaced in a seven-month crackdown by Serbian forces against
Kosovo's separatists, before an October peace agreement brought
about a tentative truce.
	   Most ethnic Albanians want independence or substantial
self-rule, whereas Serbia, in its proposal for Kosovo released last
month, has offered only a degree of autonomy while keeping the
province firmly under Serbian control.
	   ``The new (American) draft is ... almost identical to the
Serbian'' plan, Agani told reporters.
	   The United States is leading diplomatic efforts to hammer out a
solution that is acceptable to both ethnic Albanians and the
Serbian regime.
	   Washington, however, opposes full independence, fearing that
would lead to similar demands by other ethnic Albanian communities
elsewhere in the southern Balkans.
	   That in turn could destabilize what has historically been one of
Europe's most unstable regions.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, shuttling between Belgrade and
Kosovo, has so far presented four versions of a U.S. formula for
the province. Although fighting has all but ceased since the
October accord, there are fears that Kosovo will again explode in
fierce fighting unless a political solution is found by spring.
	   Agani said the latest American proposal accepts Serbia's main
demand of having Kosovo remain a part of Serbia and substantially
within Serbia's legal system.
	   The previous U.S. draft left out a detailed formula for the
province's final status but ``envisaged... independent institutions
in Kosovo,'' Agani said. He said the earlier draft ``although far
from (ethnic Albanian) demands,'' had at least ``opened up
perspective.''
	   The latest changes in the American draft were
``incomprehensible,'' he said, adding that the ethnic Albanian team
would soon come up with its own proposal for Kosovo.
	   The ethnic Albanians strongly oppose the proposed role of
Kosovo's future parliament which, according to the latest American
draft, would not be able to pass laws. Also, the draft did not
foresee Kosovo having a separate government.
	   Ivan Sedlak, an official on the Serbian negotiating team, said
the latest version of Hill's plan has not been studied by the
Serbian government. He said the previous U.S. version was
unacceptable because it defined Kosovo virtually as a separate
state.

Economic challenges facing new Venezuelan president are gargantuan

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ After a landslide victory,
president-elect Hugo Chavez is vowing to crack down on tax evaders,
cut the number of ministries by two-thirds, restructure Venezuela's
foreign debt, eliminate corruption and call a referendum to rewrite
the constitution.
	   But with Venezuela's oil-based economy running on empty _ and a
political establishment that sees Chavez as a villain _ the former
coup leader faces gargantuan obstacles.
	   ``There seems to be a wide gap between what he thinks he can do
and the reality,'' said economist Roberto Bottome.
	   Millions of Venezuelans flooded into the streets to celebrate
what they saw as a victory of the poor over a corrupt political
establishment. Chavez, who staged a failed 1992 coup attempt, won
Sunday's vote by the largest margin in Venezuela's 40 years of
democracy _ 56 percent compared to 39 percent for his challenger,
Yale-educated businessman Henrique Salas Romer.
	   The win was a stunning blow to Venezuela's political and
economic establishment and a red warning flag for Latin America _
where the gap between rich and poor is the widest in the world.
	   Wealthy Venezuelans, fearing that Chavez would impose a leftist
dictatorship, had begun sending assets out of the country even
before the vote. But reactions to Chavez's initial statements as
president-elect seemed hopeful.
	   ``I think Chavez was deeply conciliatory,'' said Andres Mata,
editor of Caracas's El Universal daily.
	   Chavez, 44, who takes office on Feb. 2, extended an olive branch
to his adversaries, saying, ``The fatherland is for everyone. ...
We must not cut Venezuela into pieces.''
	   He also said he would ``improve and deepen economic, commercial,
scientific, technological and academic relations with the United
States'' _ which last year denied him a tourist visa because of his
coup attempt.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said Monday that
heads of state normally receive a diplomatic visa to visit the
United States, and that ``the U.S. government is prepared to take
the necessary steps to address any request for a visa that
President-elect Chavez may make.''
	   Earlier in the day, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said:
``The White House applauds the Venezuelan people for their display
of democracy at work. We congratulate Mr. Chavez on his impressive
victory.''
	   But Chavez's history as a coup-plotter, his vitriolic campaign
rhetoric and his calls to change the constitution and dissolve
Congress have terrified many.
	   After he vowed to refinance part of Venezuela's dlrs 21 billion
public debt, the country's bonds trading in New York dropped
several points Monday, although they rebounded somewhat later.
Monday was a bank holiday in Venezuela, so the first reaction from
the Caracas Stock Exchange will come Tuesday.
	   Some Venezuelans are also frightened by the militaristic imagery
employed by Chavez and his supporters _ including his trademark red
parachutist's beret, which has become ubiquitous.
	   On Sunday, Chavez promised to raise the army's profile and use
it to help build infrastructure. He paid tribute to the rebellious
soldiers killed during his Feb. 4, 1992, coup attempt, but made no
mention of the dozen or so soldiers who died defending the
government.
	   Nonetheless, most of his comments aimed to calm fears.
Venezuela, an OPEC member, is the top oil exporter to the United
States, and Chavez promised to honor price-boosting agreements with
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to limit output.
	   Venezuela's economy dove into a tailspin earlier this year when
world oil prices hit a 12-year low. The country relies on oil for
75 percent of its export revenue and over half the government
budget, which has been slashed by dlrs 2 billion this year.
	   Venezuela has more oil reserves than any country outside the
Middle East, but most of its citizens live in dire poverty and
blame the ruling classes for squandering the nation's wealth.
	   Support for Chavez is feverish, but the expectations about his
presidency may be too high for Chavez's own good.
	   ``Corruption is over,'' said one reveler, 21-year-old student
Felix Villaroel. ``This country is going to be the country that
liberates all of the Americas.''
	   Carlos Andres Perez, the former president whom Chavez tried to
overthrow, also came to power on a landslide victory. But his
popularity plummeted a month after taking office in 1989 when
bloody street riots broke out over higher bus fares.
	   Chavez, who has a five-year term in office, says Venezuelans
understand he is not a ``messiah.''
	   ``It is going to cost us a lot to get out of this tomb we are
in,'' he said Sunday.

Jewish leader and city mayor discuss Holocaust memorial furor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VERENA SCHMITT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The meeting brings together men on opposite sides
of one of Germany's fiercest debates: how to remember the terror of
the Third Reich.
	   In one corner stands Ignatz Bubis, leader of Germany Jews. In
the other, Hamburg Mayor Klaus von Dohnanyi.
	   On Tuesday, they are expected to discuss a longstanding
controversy at the core of the debate _ whether Germany needs a
national Holocaust memorial _ as well the recent imbroglio over a
German author's speech complaining that media images of the
Holocaust are designed to perpetuate German guilt.
	   Reactions to Martin Walser's comments at the Frankfurt book fair
in November have filled the editorial pages of Germany's newspapers
for weeks, but few critics have been as outraged as Bubis.
	   The Jewish leader has attacked the speech as ``spiritual arson''
and the author as giving inspiration and justification to neo-Nazis
_ reactions the Hamburg mayor thinks are far too strong.
	   Walser, who received a prestigious literary award for novels
exploring the conscience of Germans rebuilding from the Nazi era,
said in his acceptance speech that references to the Auschwitz
death camp are used to pummel Germans with guilt about the past.
	   He also said that he personally has learned to turn away from
images of the Holocaust when he comes across them. And he says that
building a giant Holocaust memorial in the center of Berlin _ one
plan under consideration _ would be ``memorializing shame.''
	   Mayor von Dohnanyi (pronounced de-NA-ni) is sympathetic to
Walser's views. He recently said he doubts Jews would have behaved
better than ordinary Germans under the Nazis if the situation had
been reversed.
	   Bringing the two men together was the brainchild of the liberal
Free Democratic Party. The party hopes the private exchange, to
take place in Bonn, will produce goodwill and maybe a few new ideas
as the nation prepares to settle the Holocaust memorial question.
	   Parliament is to debate suggestions for the memorial early next
year. Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, voted out in elections Sept.
27, had supported plans for a massive monument in Berlin, near the
Brandenburg Gate. The favored design, by U.S. architect Peter
Eisenman, features 2,700 close-set concrete pillars that resemble a
graveyard.
	   The new government, led by Gerhard Schroeder, supports the
argument that a monument isn't educational enough and that a better
memorial would be to preserve existing reminders of the Third Reich
horror such as former concentration camps _ may of which are in
disrepair.
	   A third idea on the table comes from Berlin Mayor Eberhard
Diepgen and, indirectly, from Hollywood director Steven Spielberg.
Diepgen proposes combining Spielberg's film archive of interviews
with Holocaust survivors with an existing exhibit of the Nazi
regime.
	   The Topography of Terror exhibit displays Third Reich documents
and photographs in the cellar of the former Gestapo and SS
headquarters in Berlin, where Nazis tortured political prisoners.
	   Spielberg already has offered to move his Shoah Visual History
Foundation to Berlin, according to German media reports, and
Diepgen has written to him encouraging the plan.

Britain to set up compensation fund for Holocaust victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs to UPDATE with Mandelson not giving details about
fund in speech; To be led after press conference at 1545 GMT; EDITS
overline to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The government will establish a 25 million pound
(dlrs 40 million) fund to compensate Nazis' victims whose assets
were seized by Britain during World War II, The Financial Times
said Monday.
	   Trade and Industry Secretary Peter Mandelson was expected to
announce the fund's creation in a speech Monday to the
British-Israel Chamber of Commerce, the newspaper said. But
Mandelson gave no details during his talk.
	   A spokesman for the minister, speaking on customary terms of
anonymity, said only that Mandelson would unveil the compensation
plan on Tuesday in Parliament. The spokesman would not comment
further.
	   Rabbi Jonathan Romain, a spokesman for the Reform Synagogues of
Great Britain, welcomed the fund's creation, saying it was a
``long-overdue rectification of a 55-year-old injustice.''
	   Property from Nazis' victims was seized under Britain's 1939
Trading with the Enemy Act, which was intended to stop
``belligerent countries'' using property belonging to their
nationals to finance Hitler's war effort.
	   However, innocent victims, including many Jews who had sent cash
and valuables to Britain for safekeeping, were also affected by the
act and have not yet received compensation.
	   The newspaper said the plan would involve mainly people from
Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and the Czech republic, whose property
was seized by Britain because their countries were held to be
allied with Nazi Germany.

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prosecutors on Tuesday filed 28 new
charges against the man accused of masterminding last week's
nationwide letter-bombing campaign, one for each bomb he sent.
	   Colin George Dunstan, 43, a suspended tax office worker, made a
15-minute appearance in the Canberra Magistrates Court where he was
charged with 28 counts of using an explosive device in
circumstances dangerous to life.
	   Dunstan has also been charged with one count of arson with
intent to endanger life.
	   The charges relate to last Wednesday's parcel bomb explosion at
the Canberra mail sorting center and the sending of 27 other
devices to tax office and human rights commission staff around
Australia.
	   Dunstan made no plea and did not apply for bail.
	   He was remanded in custody to reappear in the same court on
Friday pending a mental health assessment.
	   Wearing a navy-blue suit, Dunstan looked composed in his first
public appearance since his arrest at Royal Canberra Hospital on
Friday, where he was admitted with a slashed wrist.
	   Magistrate Ron Cahill said he wanted an assessment of Dunstan's
mental state because he was concerned Dunstan might try to harm
himself.
	   Police said Saturday that a search of Dunstan's home had
revealed bomb making items and documentation relating to people to
whom other explosive devices were sent.
	   Dunstan had been on leave from the Australian Tax Office after
having an affair with a female co-worker in 1990 and 1991,
according to court documents. He blamed this episode for the
breakup of his own marriage.
	   He apparently also blamed the tax office and various human
rights and equal opportunity officials for his troubles. Police
said the 28 letter bombs found so far were all addressed to such
authorities.

Chavez victory shows rise of non-traditional politicians in region

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The presidential victory of former
coup leader Hugo Chavez underscores widespread discontent with
democracy and free-markets in Latin America, where non-traditional
politicians appear to be gaining strength.
	   Millions of people feel left behind by economic and political
transformations that have swept the region, where the gulf between
rich and poor is the widest in the world.
	   Chavez's victory is seen by many as a warning that old-style
parties have failed to make democracy work and reduce poverty.
	   ``We've had 40 years of democracy and 80 percent of us are
poor,'' university professor Jose Antonio Gonzalez said Sunday as
he waited to cheer Chavez at a Caracas polling station.
	   Wild celebrations broke out Sunday night in slums across the
nation after Chavez's victory was announced. He has used fiery
rhetoric to pledge a crackdown on corruption.
	   Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition won a plurality in
congressional elections Nov. 8, ending a 40-year political
stranglehold by Venezuela's two traditional parties.
	   In the past decade, dictatorships have given way to democracy
throughout Latin America, and state-run economies have generally
ceded to free markets. Yet mass poverty, disease and joblessness
persist.
	   Aside from the rise of independent politicians, many Latin
Americans are also turning to caudillos, or strong men, to clean up
corruption and attack crime.
	   President Alberto Fujimori of Peru temporarily shut down
Congress and the courts six years ago, and Bolivia's president,
Hugo Banzer, is a former dictator.
	   Like Chavez, Fujimori took over a corruption-riddled country
with an ailing economy and imposed the radical, authoritarian
solutions many expect from Chavez.
	   Many Venezuelans blame corrupt politicians for squandering the
world's largest oil reserves outside the Middle East and leaving
public services in shambles.
	   Arcides Borges, 29, a government maintenance worker in Caracas,
said the 88,000 bolivars (dlrs 154) he earns a month is barely
enough to feed and clothe his family.
	   ``Sometimes we eat and sometimes we don't,'' he said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After an abrupt, animated appearance in the
Kremlin to fire several top aides, Boris Yeltsin was back in the
hospital Tuesday to finish recovering from pneumonia.
	   The often ailing president, apparently tired of being seen as
little more than a figurehead, roused himself from his sickbed for
three hours Monday and reshuffled his staff. The dismissed aides
included some who have commented recently on Yeltsin's weakened
health.
	   ``The president wanted to show who's the boss,'' said Alexander
Shokhin, leader of the pro-government party in parliament and,
until recently, a steady Yeltsin ally. ``He's like a lion who
licked his wounds and now roared at those who thought he was
already out of the game.''
	   Shown on television, Yeltsin _ who rarely seems so robust as
when he is firing someone _ appeared energized as he scowled and
delivered one of his patented tirades.
	   ``Tough discipline, order and reform is what we need,'' Yeltsin
said slowly and sternly as he glared at his staff from the head of
a long table. Aides looked down and busied themselves scribbling
notes.
	   ``You can see how vigorous I am,'' Yeltsin said, according to
presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin.
	   Among those sacked was presidential chief of staff Valentin
Yumashev, one of Yeltsin's most loyal aides. A former journalist
who was the ghost-writer of Yeltsin's memoirs, Yumashev had served
as chief of staff for nearly two years _ an eternity in Yeltsin's
Kremlin.
	   Yeltsin also said he was personally taking charge of ``all power
ministries ... including the Justice Ministry and the tax police.''
	   ``Power ministries'' are usually defined as those related to
national defense and security. The Justice Ministry and tax police
are at the forefront of the fight against crime and corruption.
	   Yeltsin's announcement was mostly symbolic, however, since he
already wields authority over all those ministries, and the
ministers who head them were left in place.
	   Gen. Nikolai Bordyuzha, 49, the chief of Russia's Border Guards,
was appointed the new chief of staff. He immediately called efforts
to tackle corruption.
	   ``Fighting corruption is very important today, including in the
upper echelons of power,'' he said in an interview with Russia's
NTV television.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin dismissed the aides because of their
failure to stem crime or respond to several incidents of political
extremism, including anti-Semitic remarks by a Communist parliament
deputy.
	   The ousters were also thought to reflect Yeltsin's unhappiness
over aides' unusual candidness about his health. Yumashev and
others in the Kremlin have openly said that Yeltsin is too weak to
handle day-to-day affairs.
	   Yeltsin has said and done little since the economy went into a
tailspin in August, leaving Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to
tackle the crisis.
	   Despite growing calls for the president's resignation, based on
his poor health, Yeltsin has insisted he will serve his term, which
ends in 2000.
	   Yeltsin has been hospitalized with pneumonia since Nov. 22.

Surprise weapons inspections to begin Tuesday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with new details, comments from
former weapons inspector Scott Ritter &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors will begin a
series of surprise inspections in Iraq on Tuesday in a final test
of whether Baghdad is cooperating fully in the search for banned
weapons, chief inspector Richard Butler said.
	   The Iraqis in the past have tried to block or thwart some
no-notice inspections, calling them provocative and an infringement
of sovereignty.
	   After the surprise inspections are finished late this week or
early next week, Butler said Monday that he will prepare a report
for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on whether or not Iraq has
kept its Nov. 14 promise to resume unconditional cooperation with
the inspectors.
	   Annan will then report to the Security Council which must decide
that Iraq is in full cooperation with inspectors before it will
undertake a comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions.
	   Diplomats said if a comprehensive review is approved it will not
start until January.
	   Iraqi leaders see the review as the quickest route to easing or
lifting economic sanctions but diplomats say it will merely
establish a list of Baghdad's outstanding obligations _ and the
United States insists there is no link to ending sanctions.
	   The U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, and the
International Atomic Energy Agency must certify that Baghdad has
eliminated banned weapons before the Security Council can lift
sweeping economic sanctions imposed in 1990 after Iraq invaded
Kuwait.
	   Iraq curtailed UNSCOM's activities on Aug. 5, and completely
shut down inspections Oct. 31. Under threat of U.S. airstrikes,
Iraqi leaders reversed course Nov. 14 and promised to give
inspectors unfettered access to all sites and documents related to
its programs to develop nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
and long-range missiles.
	   Since the weapons inspectors returned, they have been testing
Iraq's promise, seeking access to documents, interviewing Iraqi
weapons experts and monitoring previously inspected sites to make
sure dual-use equipment is not used for banned weapons purpose.
	   Butler said the senior weapons inspector in Baghdad had informed
Iraq's National Monitoring Directorate Monday that the surprise
inspections were about to begin.
	   ``They're about to start a series of inspections which will be
the last piece for us to test whether or not Iraq has kept its
promise of full cooperation,'' Butler said. ``These are surprise
inspections.''
	   Former weapons inspector Scott Ritter, in an article for The New
Republic magazine published Monday, said surprise inspections will
fail because Baghdad has had time to shift documents and materials
to new, secret locations.
	   ``Iraq has had plenty of time to shuffle the deck, to hide its
weapons to stay one or two steps ahead of the weapons inspectors,''
Ritter said Monday at a press briefing.
	   ``When inspectors start carrying out no-notice inspections, they
will find nothing, and in so finding nothing they will only
reinforce Iraq's argument that there is in fact nothing in Iraq,''
he said at the briefing.
	   Ritter insisted that the Iraqis are hiding weapons of mass
destruction but he said the Security Council isn't pushing for
Iraq's disarmament. And he accused Butler of working with
secretary-general Annan to ensure that a comprehensive review is
favorable to Baghdad.
	   `Scott Ritter sadly is playing off a very old sheet of music,
and he's wrong,'' retorted Butler.

While Clemens talks go on, Montgomery stays with Royals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ As Toronto focused its Roger Clemens trade talks
Monday, nearly 100 free agents faced a midnight EST (0500 GMT)
deadline to re-sign with their former teams.
	   Reliever Jeff Montgomery was the first to make a decision,
agreeing in the afternoon to stay with Kansas City for a dlrs 2.5
million, one-year contract _ a dlrs 300,000 paycut.
	   Dave Stieb, who went 1-2 with a 4.83 ERA for Toronto in his
comeback, agreed to a minor league deal with the Blue Jays. Stieb,
who hadn't pitched since 1993, would get a dlrs 400,000, one-year
contract if he makes the team.
	   Players who didn't re-sign with their former teams by midnight
EST can't until May 1. By offering salary arbitration, teams could
extend the deadline through Jan. 8.
	   San Diego offered salary arbitration to Kevin Brown, the top
free agent pitcher still available. The Padres also offered
arbitration to outfielder Steve Finley, who agreed earlier in the
day to a dlrs 21.5 million, four-year contract with the Arizona
Diamondbacks.
	   ``I'm going to be 34 next season,'' Finley said. ``I'm not a
22-year-old who's going to play another 10 or 12 years and maybe
have a couple of chances to go. I want to win now. When I saw they
signed (Randy) Johnson, I wanted to be here then for sure.''
	   Finley gets a dlrs 500,000 signing bonus and salaries of dlrs
5.25 million per season. He is deferring dlrs 2.5 million in each
of the first two years and dlrs 2 million in each of the last two,
all at 6 percent interest for four years.
	   Arizona spent dlrs 118.9 million on six free agents during the
past month in a dramatic effort to transform an expansion team that
lost 97 games into a NL contender.
	   Texas, meanwhile, offered arbitration to pitcher Roger Pavlik,
but declined to offer it to pitchers Scott Bailes, Greg Cadaret,
Bill Haselman and Xavier Hernandez.

Padres, Rockies might open season in Monterrey, Mexico
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERNIE WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ The San Diego Padres, who've jetted off on some
unique road trips the last few seasons, could be heading south of
the border again.
	   U.S. Major League Baseball has asked the National League
champion Padres to play in the season-opening Sunday night game in
Monterrey, Mexico, against the Colorado Rockies on April 4, The
Associated Press has learned.
	   Details are still being worked out for the game, which would be
played at 25,644-seat Estadio Monterrey and televised by ESPN.
	   Unlike in 1996, when the Padres played in the first
regular-season series in Mexico, also at Monterrey, this would be
just a one-game trip. The NL West rivals would head to San Diego to
finish the series with games on April 6 _ the Padres' home opener _
and April 7.
	   Just like in 1996, agreements must be reached with the opposing
team, the players' association and Mexican officials. Gene Orza,
the union's No. 2 official, said the game will be discussed Tuesday
at the union's board meeting in Las Vegas.
	   ``If we're picked by major league baseball to receive this
honor, I think everybody in San Diego should take pride in that,''
said Charles Steinberg, Padres senior vice president for public
affairs.
	   The Padres are a natural choice because of their efforts in
international marketing. When they faced a potential conflict with
the Republican Convention in August 1996, they moved a three-game
series against the New York Mets to Monterrey.
	   Mexican hero Fernando Valenzuela started and won the first game
of that series for the Padres. Now out of baseball, he might be
considered to throw out the ceremonial first pitch if this game
goes through. The Rockies have a Mexican hero of their own _ third
baseman Vinny Castilla.
	   Monterrey, an industrial city ringed by the eastern Sierra
Madre, is where Ken Caminiti played a memorable game that helped
propel him toward unanimous selection as 1996 NL MVP. Weakened by
food poisoning and dehydration, the Padres' third baseman took two
bags of intravenous fluid before the final game of the series,
wolfed down a candy bar and went out and hit two home runs.
	   The Padres moved a series against the St. Louis Cardinals to
Honolulu in April 1997, and there's been talk of perhaps playing a
series in Japan in the future.
	   Also in 1997, the Padres developed a working agreement with
Japan's Chiba Lotte Marines and obtained the rights to Hideki
Irabu. Irabu refused to sign with the Padres, so they dealt him and
three minor leaguers to the New York Yankees for dlrs 3 million and
two players.

NFL considering instant replay for playoffs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ After two weeks of well-publicized officiating
gaffes, the National Football League is considering a return to
instant replay for this year's playoffs.
	   League spokesman Joe Browne confirmed Monday that if the owners
approve, ``a limited form of replay for use in the upcoming
postseason is a possibility.''
	   The new replay system would likely take the form used in
preseason experiments _ with coaches give a limited number of
challenges per game and referees making the final decision from
monitors on the sideline.
	   But it also would be what Browne called ``liberal,'' meaning
that if a coach is out of challenges on a game-deciding play, he
would be allowed an additional one.
	   That would apply to plays such as the one by the New York Jets'
Vinny Testaverde with 20 seconds left against Seattle on Sunday.
That play was called a touchdown, although countless replays showed
Testaverde had come up short of the goal line.
	   A proposal for a new form of replay, which was in effect from
1986 to 1991, was voted down at an owners' meeting in March. It got
``yes'' votes from 21 of the 30 teams, two short of the
three-fourths needed.
	   But Sunday's call, plus a questionable call that allowed New
England to beat Buffalo a week ago and the botched coin flip in the
Pittsburgh-Detroit game on Thanksgiving, have had a ripple effect
around the league.
	   Buffalo's Ralph Wilson, who voted against replay in March, said
last week that he has changed his mind. And Browne said that calls
to owners by commissioner Paul Tagliabue had convinced him that
there were enough votes to approve the proposal
	   The ``no'' votes last March came from seven teams that have
voted regularly against replay _ the New York Giants, Arizona,
Buffalo, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Chicago and Tampa Bay. They were
joined by San Diego and Oakland.
	   Tagliabue spent most of Monday discussing the problem with
owners and league officials.
	   Tagliabue couldn't have missed Monday's New York newspapers, all
three of which had a front-page picture of Testaverde lying on the
ground a foot short of the end zone. Still, the play was ruled a
touchdown and the Jets beat Seattle, 32-31.
	   The call in the game's closing seconds kept the Jets tied with
Miami in the AFC East and in effect knocked the Seahawks from
playoff contention. It also had an impact on Wilson's Bills, Miami
and New England, which are in a four-way scramble with the Jets in
the AFC East.
	   The technology is in place because of the replay experiments
during exhibition games. All that's needed is a phone vote by the
owners. No timetable for that conference call has been set.
	   The system that has been tried in exhibitions involves giving
coaches challenges on calls _ perhaps two a half or two a game _
with the referee making the final decision after viewing the play
on a sideline monitor.
	   That would help end the objections to the old system, which used
a replay official in a booth and was filled with endless challenges
and endless delays, some lasting longer than five minutes.
	   The objections to the challenge system came mainly from the
coaches, who have been split among a number of proposals. Some
wonder what would happen in a situation such as the Seahawks-Jets
game if a coach had exhausted his challenges before a game-turning
play at the finish.

Clinton visit to showcase growing U.S.-Palestinian ties

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Relations between the United States and the
Palestinians have gotten better and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu isn't the only one unhappy about it.
	   With Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat getting ready to play host
to U.S. President Bill Clinton next Monday, many Palestinians are
also having trouble accepting their leader's new alliance with a
U.S. government they perceive as anti-Arab.
	   Clinton's trip, the first by a sitting U.S. president to the
autonomous Palestinian areas, is seen by Palestinian leaders as
long-sought U.S. recognition of Arafat's struggle for statehood.
	   But popular sentiment in the West Bank and Gaza _ where U.S.
flags are still more likely to be burned than waved _ runs from
indifference to outright hostility.
	   Clinton is perceived as an ardent supporter of Israel, and many
Palestinians believe U.S. policy _ including bombing attacks on
Iraq, Sudan and Afghanistan _ remains anti-Arab and anti-Muslim.
	   ``The (Palestinian) leadership has always attempted to curry
favor with the Americans,'' said Hanan Ashrawi, a former
Palestinian Cabinet minister and spokeswoman. ``It always wanted to
be accepted in the club. But the Palestinian people do not trust
the Americans.''
	   Netanyahu is also unhappy about the visit, grumbling that the
Palestinians ``think they have the United States in their back
pocket,'' and that perhaps Clinton should stay home.
	   But for Arafat, shunned by U.S. presidents for most of his 30
years as Palestinian leader, the Clinton visit offers a rare
opportunity to consolidate his friendship with the Americans and
perhaps embarrass Netanyahu in the process.
	   The highlight will be Clinton's address Monday to members of the
Palestine National Council, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile,
and representatives of other Palestinian groups.
	   Among those attending the address will be former guerrillas
including Mohammed Abbas, mastermind of the 1985 Archille Lauro
cruise ship hijacking during which American Leon Klinghoffer was
shot dead and thrown overboard.
	   Clinton's appearance before the 1,500 delegates will serve as a
final stamp of approval for one-time PLO militants who spent their
lives fighting Israel and the United States.
	   At the conference, the Palestine National Council members are to
remove a call for Israel's destruction from the PLO charter. Israel
insists that the gathering is an official meeting and wants the
members to vote, at least by a show of hands. Palestinians say no
formal vote is required.
	   The Israelis fear that Clinton, eager to avoid any snags, will
declare the session a success and the offending charter clauses
revoked even if Israel feels the job was not completed.
	   Ironically, Netanyahu's hard-line positions are seen as having
prodded the reluctant Americans into a more active role, turning
them from mediators into negotiators and finally into referees.
	   As a result, Washington has publicly backed the Palestinians in
some, though not all, of their disputes with Israel over
implementation of the agreement.
	   ``Netanyahu and (Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel) Sharon are very
worried about the unusual closeness in relations between the U.S.
administration and Yasser Arafat,'' Israeli political commentator
Shimon Shiffer wrote in the Yediot Ahronot daily. ``They view this
as a very dangerous development.''
	   But even for Arafat, closer ties with Clinton and promises of an
additional dlrs 900 million in U.S. aid are a mixed blessing.
	   It will be much more difficult now for Arafat to turn down
Clinton when he asks for compromise with Israel.
	   Arafat is also aware how unpopular his new alliance is among his
people, many of whom have not forgotten the acrimony of the past,
including a long-standing U.S. refusal to recognize the PLO.
	   As recently as 1991, Arafat provoked U.S. wrath by siding with
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War.
	   Hoping to bring his people around, Arafat has ordered 25,000
American flags from a Gaza plastics factory, to be placed in the
hands of cheering crowds and strung across potholed streets.
	   However, in the dusty West Bank refugee camp of Aqabat Jaber,
miles (kilometers) away from the buzz over Clinton, there was no
excitement.
	   Ramadan Ghouj, swatting flies in his barbershop, dared visitors
to find evidence that life had improved as a result of Arafat's new
ties to the Americans.
	   The 53-year-old who makes about dlrs 6 a day said he hadn't seen
any signs of U.S. aid money in the shantytown.
	   Whatever Arafat does, Ghouj said, will make little difference
for the Palestinians. ``America does what it wants. It's all in
their hands.''

Texas' Ricky Williams wins first AP player of year award

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Ricky Williams returned for his final year at
Texas with modest goals: Win games and have fun.
	   Mission accomplished, and he still gets to play in the Cotton
Bowl.
	   On Monday, Williams won The Associated Press' first College
Player of the Year Award in balloting by AP member newspapers, TV
and radio stations.
	   ``Anytime you are considered the best it's flattering,''
Williams said, ``and to be picked the top player in college
football by the reporters who watch the games so closely is truly
an honor.''
	   Williams provided college football fans with an extra special
season. While running for 2,214 yards and 27 touchdowns _ he also
had a TD reception _ Williams became major college football's
career rushing leader and carried his team to an 8-3 record and a
Cotton Bowl matchup against Mississippi State on Jan. 1.
	   Williams received 76 of the 143 votes in the AP balloting,
easily outdistancing Kansas State quarterback Michael Bishop, who
had 17 votes. Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch was third with 15
votes.
	   On Saturday, Williams will be the overwhelming favorite to win
the Heisman Trophy, given each year to college football's most
outstanding player.
	   Watching Williams play turned into lots of fun for everyone
except the Longhorns' opponents. Just ask Texas A and M.
	   When he ripped off a 60-yard touchdown run against the Aggies on
Nov. 27, he broke Tony Dorsett's career rushing record and started
the Longhorns on their way to a 26-24 upset. He finished the game
with 259 yards, giving him a career total of 6,279 yards to
Dorsett's 6,082 from 1973-76.
	   The record-setting run was typical. Needing 11 yards to pass
Dorsett's 22-year-old mark, Williams shed a tackler near the line
of scrimmage, ran nearly 60 yards and then carried an Aggies
defensive back into the end zone.
	   Williams owns 15 other NCAA records, including most career
touchdowns (75), points (452) and all-purpose yards (7,206). He
also averaged a record 6.22 yards per carry.
	   UCLA quarterback Cade McNown was fourth in the voting, followed
by North Carolina State wide receiver Torry Holt, Ohio State
quarterback Joe Germaine, Central Florida quarterback Daunte
Culpepper, Wisconsin running back Ron Dayne, Louisiana Tech wide
receiver Troy Edwards and Florida State wide receiver Peter
Warrick.

Judge: No decision yet on Tyson probation

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ The judge who sentenced Mike Tyson for his
1992 rape conviction still has not decided if the former
heavyweight champion violated parole and should be returned to
prison.
	   Marion County Superior Court Judge Patricia Gifford was awaiting
a report from the county's probation department on Tyson's
no-contest plea last week to misdemeanor assault charges in
Maryland.
	   That report could be used as evidence of a possible parole
violation.
	   ``Until I've reviewed the report and made a decision, it would
be inappropriate to comment on possible action,'' Gifford said
Monday.
	   But she said that once she receives the report, she could do one
of three things: issue a warrant for Tyson's arrest; schedule a
hearing on the report; or take no action until Tyson is sentenced
in Maryland.
	   George Walker, the chief probation officer for Marion Superior
Court, said last week that it appeared Tyson violated terms of his
probation as a result of his no-contest plea.
	   A recording on Walker's office answering machine said he was
refusing comment until he submits his report to Gifford. The
recording said Walker does not expect to present the report to
Gifford until later this week.
	   Tyson was convicted Feb. 10, 1992, of one count of rape and two
counts of deviate sexual conduct. Gifford sentenced Tyson to 10
years in prison and suspended four. He was released from the
Indiana Youth Center on March 25, 1995, and ordered to serve four
years' probation.
	   His sentencing is Maryland is expected early next year. The
Montgomery County (Maryland) District Court said no exact
sentencing date has been set.
	   Tyson's no-contest plea stemmed from an August traffic accident
in which two motorists claimed he kicked and punched them.
	   Indiana authorities also reviewed the probation _ but took no
action _ after Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's ears during a title
bout in June 1997. The Nevada Athletic Commission stripped Tyson of
his boxing license but reinstated him in October.
	   Tyson plans to fight Francois Botha on Jan. 16. A news
conference is scheduled for Tuesday in Los Angeles to announce the
bout.
	   Walker said last week that Gifford will have great latitude in
responding to his report.
	   ``The judge can do everything from nothing all the way to
imposing the originally suspended sentence, and anything in
between,'' he said.
	   Tyson's no-contest plea was not an admission of guilt. However,
Tyson could face up to 20 years in prison _ 10 years on each count
_ and be fined up to dlrs 5,000 when he is sentenced. The two men
he scuffled with already have agreed to a settlement to avoid a
civil suit.
	   Tyson is training in the Phoenix area and intends to live there.
He already has registered as a sex offender in Arizona as part of
his planned move.
	   To clear the way for his move, Tyson is selling his 62-acre
estate in Ohio, along with homes in Las Vegas and Connecticut, The
Plain Dealer of Cleveland reported. The total asking price is dlrs
21 million.

The world is changing, and so must NATO
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. Meeting to begin at 0800 GMT.
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The world is changing, and so must
NATO.
	   That's the fact of life facing foreign ministers Tuesday and
Wednesday when they begin revising NATO's strategic concept, the
military and political principles that define the 16-member
alliance's mission.
	   ``NATO's primary mission will always remain defense against
aggression,'' U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright wrote in
the Financial Times, a London newspaper. ``But the founders of the
alliance also distinguished between what the treaty commits us to
do and what it permits us to do.''
	   Today's threat is no longer a Russian tank assault across the
plains of Central Europe, but challenges from regional conflicts
like Bosnia and Kosovo, terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass
destruction. When these threats originate from outside NATO's
traditional territory of operations, the alliance must be prepared
to deal with them.
	   In practice, NATO has already adjusted to these new realities,
intervening in Bosnia, halting the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo
with the threat of air strikes, sending soldiers just across the
Kosovo border in Macedonia to rescue civilian cease-fire monitors
if needed.
	   ``Bosnia and Kosovo are recent examples that demonstrate NATO
must act when conflicts beyond its immediate borders affect
alliance interests,'' Albright wrote. ``NATO must find the right
balance between the centrality of NATO's collective defense
missions and responding to such crises.''
	   NATO's central mission will always be collective defense and the
concept that an attack against one member is an aggression against
all. But attacks against members now take different forms and often
originate far away.
	   The ministers will prepare for the NATO summit April 24-25 in
Washington. Among top issues there will be approval of the new
strategic concept and the welcoming of three new members, Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic, as well as celebrating the
alliance's 50th birthday.
	   Albright will propose at the ministerial meeting here to set up
a Center for Weapons of Mass Destruction, essentially on how to
best share and use intelligence, officials said.
	   The plan would use NATO headquarters staff under one director,
with perhaps a few extra experts, they said.
	   The Germans plan to bring up the nuclear first-strike question.
	   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer made waves when he
called on NATO last month to consider dropping its doctrine
allowing a nuclear first-strike. This doctrine, reaffirmed as
recently as last year, has always been a part of NATO's nuclear
strategy and is considered an important aspect of deterrence.
	   ``The minister will certainly raise the issue,'' a German
diplomatic source said. ``We have to see that in the context of
arms control, arms reduction and nonproliferation.''
	   The Germans don't have much backing on the issue, however.
	   The allies will assess the situation in Kosovo, where Serb
security forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas clashed for seven
months. The threat of a NATO air strike stopped the fighting in
October and the cease-fire is generally holding, while American
mediator Christopher Hill attempts to firm the peace with political
agreement.
	   The ministers also will make their six-monthly review of the
situation in Bosnia. No major reduction in the 32,000-troop level
in the NATO-led peacekeeping force is expected soon.

Judge quashes parents' request
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TERRI LANGFORD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ The parents of gymnast Dominique Moceanu won't
get an opportunity to question their daughter about her accusations
against her father before the three meet in a courtroom this week,
a judge ruled Monday.
	   Camelia and Dumitru Moceanu had requested that their attorney be
allowed to question the 17-year-old gold medalist before a judge on
Wednesday considers making permanent a temporary restraining order
barring contact between the gymnast and her father.
	   But Moceanu's court-appointed attorney, Ellen Yarrell,
challenged the request and asked that it be blocked. Associate
Judge Michael Hay complied.
	   ``We thought it was inappropriate,'' Yarrell said Monday. ``We
offered to answer written questions.''
	   However, Katherine Scardino, attorney for Moceanu's parents,
rejected that offer, Yarrell said.
	   Calls to Scardino were not immediately returned Monday to The
Associated Press.
	   Yarrell said she was concerned that if a judge granted the
parents' motion, they would use the session to speak to the gymnast
in their native Romanian language, as they had in at least one
other meeting with their daughter. Yarrell characterized the
behavior as an intimidation tactic.
	   ``Later she told me that she felt that they were putting
incredible pressure on her at that time,'' Yarrell said.
	   Speaking through publicist Janey Miller, Moceanu said she felt
``very good,'' about the Monday ruling.
	   In court affidavits filed a week ago, the Olympian claimed her
father had hired a private investigator to track her comings and
goings. Moceanu also said police officers informed her that her
father had negotiated to pay a hit man dlrs 10,000 to kill a
friend, 32-year-old Brian Huggins, and Luminita Miscenco, 26, the
coach Moceanu credits with reviving her career.
	   Both she and Huggins have been granted a restraining order
against Dumitru Moceanu.
	   On Wednesday, Moceanu and her parents will appear before state
District Judge John Montgomery, who will determine whether to make
the restraining order permanent.
	   The restraining order request marks a deepening rift between the
gymnast and her family that began last October, when the
Houston-area teen-ager fled her home, hired a lawyer and then sued
to be declared an independent adult.
	   She was granted adult status Oct. 28, allowing her to begin
making inquiries about how her earnings have been spent. She has
claimed that her trust fund bankrolled unauthorized risky
investments and a dlrs 4 million gym bearing her name.
	   However, it is not known how much was in the trust or how much
has been spent.
	   There was no answer at the Moceanu family home Monday and a
message left for the parents at the family's private gymnasium was
not immediately returned to the AP.
	   However, in an interview with Houston television station KTRK,
Mrs. Moceanu said she was distressed about the family's discord,
but also said it was time for her daughter to grow up. ``She's not
a baby anymore,'' she said.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks advanced strongly Monday as Microsoft and
a growing array of hot Internet companies rocketed the Nasdaq to a
new record high. At the close on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 54.33 points _ or by 0.6 percent _ at
9,070.47. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 37.43 at
2,040.59, beating the old record of 2,016.44 set Nov. 27. The
Nasdaq is now up 29 percent for the year, an increase twice as high
as the Dow. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ ScottishPower PLC on Monday announced an agreed
4.7 billion pound (dlrs 7.8 billion) merger _ widely seen as a
takeover _ of the U.S. electricity utility PacifiCorp. The new
group, which will reportedly be the world's largest multi-utility
group, will be based in Glasgow and will retain the ScottishPower
name and its primary listing in London, the company said. Its U.S.
head office will be in Portland, Oregon. If approved, the deal _
expected to close late next year _ would be the first time a
foreign company has acquired a U.S. utility. The merger must,
however, get past a U.S. law limiting foreign ownership of
electricity distribution. (BRITAIN-SCOTTTISHPOWER-PACIFICORP)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Unemployment in the European Union
stood at 9.8 percent in October, unchanged from September when it
fell under 10 percent for the first time in 6 years. Unemployment
in the EU has dropped 0.8 percent since October 1997, when it stood
at 10.6 percent, the EU's statistics office Eurostat said in a
statement Monday. In the 11 countries that will join the single
currency zone on Jan. 1, the jobless rate fell to 10.8 percent in
October, from 10.9 in September, Eurostat said. (EU-UNEMPLOYMENT)
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Six Arab Gulf leaders
opened an annual summit Monday that was expected to focus on
falling oil prices, which have hit their economies hard. Shortly
before the meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council began, January
futures contracts for Brent crude _ a widely watched benchmark _
fell to a record low of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on the International
Petroleum Exchange in London. Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar
or two less than the North Sea's Brent. The Gulf oil producers, who
control about half of global oil reserves, have been hard hit by
the oil market crisis, which has been blamed on the recession in
Asia and warmer-than-usual winters. Oil exports account for some 75
percent of their revenues. (GULF-SUMMIT)
	   MUSCAT, Oman (AP) _ Oman does not plan to join the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the official Omani News Agency on
Monday quoted the oil minister as saying. But the minister,
Mohammed bin Hamed al-Rumhi, said the country was willing to work
with OPEC to try to stem the fall in prices, the agency said.
``Oman is ready to cooperate with OPEC in finding solutions to the
fall in international oil prices,'' the agency quoted al-Rumhi as
saying. News reports quoted OPEC secretary-general Rilwanu Lukman
as saying Sunday at an economic conference in Oman that non-OPEC
countries Russia, Oman and Mexico are planning to join the
13-nation oil cartel. (MIDDLE EAST-BUSINESS BRIEFS)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's state-run international carrier
and the country's domestic airline will be controlled by a common
holding company, officials announced Monday, a step away from a
possible merger to streamline management and end huge losses. The
decision was taken by the boards of Air India and the domestic
carrier Indian Airlines at a meeting in New Delhi, Press Trust of
India reported. The news agency had earlier said the airlines were
heading for a merger. The two companies together employ 52,000
employees, the Air India Officials Union said. Air India last month
asked for a dlrs 238 million government bailout as well as help in
finding a private investor to bring in another dlrs 183 million.
(INDIA-AIRLINE MERGER)
	   PARIS (AP) _ The head of France's state-run railroad, hobbled by
strikes for an eleventh day, issued a call Monday to employees to
end the walkout because it hurts both clients and the company.
Louis Gallois, speaking at a news conference, said the 1999 budget
of the SNCF foresees stable employee rolls for the first time in 17
years. Until now, the number of workers has fallen annually.
Gallois said he was not yet in a position to provide personnel
figures, but said that in 1999 there will be for the first time in
17 years ``stability in the number of personnel.'' Striking
conductors want an additional 600 employees. (FRANCE-RAIL STRIKE)

Dollar higher against yen, Japanese stocks rise in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen early Tuesday
on continued positive sentiment toward the U.S. economy, while
Japanese stocks advanced moderately.
	   The dollar bought 120.36 yen in early trading, up 1.40 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
119.81 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 99.93
points, or 0.68 percent, to 14,823.42 points in the first 30
minutes of trading. On Monday, the average closed up 83.52 points,
or 0.57 percent.
	   Traders bought the U.S. currency as an overnight rise on Wall
Street boosted confidence among investors. The Dow Jones industrial
average closed at 9,070.47 points on Monday, up 54.33.
	   On Friday, the U.S. Labor Department said the nation's
unemployment rate stood at a 28-year low. That data was helpful in
diffusing increasing speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve would
move to again ease interest rates in the near future.
	   Expectations of lower interest rates put downward pressure on
the U.S. currency as reduced rates mean lower yields on
dollar-denominated deposits.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices opened higher, with
export-oriented issues leading the way.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
exchange's first section was up 6.24 points, or 0.55 percent, to
1,131.24. The TOPIX closed up 4.28 points, or 0.38 percent, the day
before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.080 percent from Monday's finish of 1.060 percent,
driving its price down to 106.20 yen from 106.38 yen.

Australian government says ``no'' to Aboriginal self-determination
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Aboriginal leaders on Tuesday
denounced federal government calls for the removal of the words
``self determination'' from an international declaration on the
rights of indigenous people.
	   The non-binding declaration is now being negotiated at the
United Nations in Geneva, but the Australian government says
self-determination might imply a right to secession.
	   Mick Dodson, a member of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander delegation to the United Nations, said the government was
wrongly suggesting Aborigines wanted to set up black states.
	   ``This is a mischievous misrepresentation of the position
domestically in Australia,'' he told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
radio.
	   ``There is not one single indigenous group in Australia who have
called for a separate nation state.
	   ``No one is calling for that and that is mischievous and
misleading to suggest that that is what indigenous Australians are
asking for.''
	   If the government wanted greater assurances of security, Prime
Minister John Howard could include discussion of the meaning of
self-determination in his preparation for a reconciliation document
with indigenous people, Dodson said.
	   ``The whole of the declaration ... is subject to international
law and there is sufficient protection for territorial integrity
available now in international law,'' he said.
	   ``But if Australia wants to be doubly safe why don't we
negotiate some arrangement, some new relationship in the context of
a document for reconciliation?''
	   Howard's government is responding to pressure from right-wing
conservatives, including those in Pauline Hanson's One Nation
Party, who claim Aborigines and the United Nations are plotting to
set up independent black states within Australia.

ASEAN's policy of non-intervention put to the test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With ASEAN-Cambodia &QL; 
 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The longstanding pledge by
Southeast Asian nations to avoid interfering in each other's
business was put to the test recently when U.S. Vice President Al
Gore came to town and stepped into Malaysia's internal affairs.
	   In front of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, host to a
Pacific-Rim trade summit last month, Gore praised ``the brave
people of Malaysia'' for their fledgling democratic reform
movement, one that calls for Mahathir's political demise.
	   Most of the members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations came to Malaysia's defense, saying they found it
unspeakably rude that America's No. 2 leader would come to Malaysia
and spout off about Western-style democracy.
	   Even Thailand, the ASEAN member leading the call for more
cross-border criticism within the nine-nation group, chastised the
U.S. interference into Malaysian affairs.
	   ``You have to be very, very careful toward each other's
feelings,'' Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuan said.
	   When ASEAN leaders meet in Hanoi, Vietnam, for their annual
two-day summit starting Dec. 15, being very careful of one
another's feelings may be difficult. Relations within the
organization, founded in 1967 to prevent the spread of war in the
region, have been severely strained this past year.
	   Bickering between Malaysia and Singapore escalated to fevered
threats and accusations over border controls, air space and water
rights until Mahathir called a truce.
	   The Philippine and Indonesian presidents took the unprecedented
step of publicly reprimanding Mahathir for the sacking and jailing
of his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Next week, the Philippines will take issue with China, who is
sending Vice President Hu Jintao to observe the summit. The
Philippines is expected to urge ASEAN to issue a statement on the
conflicting claims over the mineral-rich atolls and reefs that
straddle vital sea lanes in the South China Sea.
	   Then there's Myanmar, also known as Burma, the newest ASEAN
member. The group has been criticized for accepting the
military-ruled country because of its dreadful human rights record,
making diplomats more cautious about the admission of Cambodia.
	   ASEAN currently comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. When
established, its goal was to bring all 10 Southeast Asian nations
into the ASEAN brotherhood; Cambodia's membership would fulfill
that pledge.
	   Cambodia was on the verge of joining ASEAN last year when Prime
Minister Hun Sen toppled his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, in a violent coup.
	   Now that a coalition government is in place in Phnom Penh, Hun
Sen has made entry into ASEAN a priority, seeing it as key to
establishing international legitimacy.
	   But Vietnam and Malaysia are the only ASEAN nations publicly
backing Cambodia's immediate entry and the membership issue is
likely to dominate the summit.
	   Non-interference into members' internal affairs could also be on
the agenda, though an attempt by Thailand and the Philippines to
alter that ASEAN founding principle was rejected when foreign
ministers met in Manila in July.
	   Surin told his counterparts that if they do not speak more
frankly about human rights and environmental issues, ASEAN would
lose credibility.
	   ``Like it or not, the issues of democracy and human rights are
those that we have to increasingly deal with in our engagement with
the outside world,'' Surin said.
	   Other ASEAN members strongly disagreed.
	   Vietnam, which as summit host is supposed to mediate disputes
and foster consensus, opposes suggestions that the time has come to
comment on neighbors' internal affairs.
	   A draft of the Hanoi Declaration obtained by The Associated
Press and expected to be presented next week indicates that Vietnam
hopes to keep the non-interference issue out on the greens: ``We
shall endeavor to resolve all our outstanding problems and prevent
the emergence of disputes in the ASEAN way.''
	   Critics of ASEAN say that's the problem. The so-called ``ASEAN
way'' has accomplished little in the past 31 years.
	   ``So long as you have some countries who do not recognize the
need for change, it will not move forward,'' said Abdul Razak
Baginda, director of the Malaysian Strategic Research Center, a
leading Kuala Lumpur think tank.
	   Abdul Razak notes that ASEAN was paralyzed during the hazardous
haze that blanketed the region last year. It stood by silently
during the Cambodian coup and the deadly riots that led to the end
of Indonesian President Suharto's 32-year rule in May.
	   And it has done little to focus on the crippling Asian economic
crisis, now well into its second year.
	   ``Clearly, ASEAN is unable to come up with some very strong
common stands,'' said Abdul Razak. ``One gets the impression that
it's every man for himself.''
	   The fledgling reform movement in Malaysia is hoping ASEAN will
chuck the non-interference policy and use the summit to discuss
Anwar, who is on trial for corruption and sodomy.
	   ``You speak about justice, universal values and human rights,
that's not interference to me,'' Azizah Ismail, Anwar's wife and de
facto leader of his reform movement, told the Thai newspaper The
Nation. ``Because those values are borderless.''
	   Mahathir disagrees. During a recent visit to Brunei, he said
Southeast Asian leaders who begin sniping at one another would
undermine regional unity.
	   ``That will be very bad, because we all have got a lot of things
to criticize about each other,'' said Mahathir, prime minister for
17 years and currently Asia's longest-serving leader.

Boy fails in legal action over kangaroo attack on golf course
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A teen-age boy on Tuesday failed his
bid to be compensated being mauled by a kangaroo at a New South
Wales golf course two years ago.
	   Fifteen-year-old Steven Shorten, of Grafton on the New South
Wales north coast, sued the Grafton District Golf Club in the
District Court for 750,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 465,000)
after he was knocked down, jumped on and gouged by a kangaroo in
October 1996.
	   The kangaroo also broke his cheekbone and slashed his abdomen,
back and legs.
	   But Judge Barry Mahoney found it was unreasonable to expect the
golf club to supervise children using the course to prevent such
attacks.
	   ``Further, I regard it as unreasonable to require the (golf
club) to either eradicate, remove or relocate kangaroos presently
on its course and to prevent those or other kangaroos from
regaining access to it,'' the judge said.
	   He said the golf club had given evidence that it would cost
90,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 56,000) to fence the course to
keep kangaroos out.
	   The judge also dismissed the boy's lawyers' arguments that the
club was liable because it had not put up adequate warning signs
about the possibility of kangaroo attacks.

Japan sees bright signs in economy, but outlook still severe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's struggling economy showed isolated signs of
improvement in November but the overall outlook remains bleak, the
government said Tuesday,
	   Domestic demand for household appliances and mini-vehicles
recovered slightly, and growth in Japan's unemployment rate
appeared to be easing, the Economic Planning Agency said in its
monthly report on the economy.
	   Still, the general state of the economy remained ``extremely
severe,'' an assessment that was unchanged from the the previous
month's report.
	   ``We see some bright signs here and there,'' said EPA official
Takashi Omori. ``But, on the other hand, there are things that
continue to worsen, so we're not at the point where we can say the
overall picture has started to change.''
	   The agency said that deflationary pressures in the economy
continued to cut into corporate profits, forcing continued layoffs
and cutbacks in investment.
	   Japan's jobless rate remained at a record high of 4.3 percent
for the third straight month in October, the latest period for
which figures were available.
	   Many sectors of the economy, such as department store and
supermarket sales, continued to deteriorate, the report said.
	   One of the few strong areas _ continued growth in exports _ was
being threatened as economies in the United States and Europe show
signs of faltering and protectionist pressures emerge.
	   Japan is mired in its worst recession since World War II, as
debt-ridden financial institutions scale back on lending, starving
companies of cash.
	   EPA Director General Taichi Sakaiya told reporters after the
release of the report that he believed the economy ``may be
approaching the bottom,'' but that he was unsure when it would
start to recover.

U.S. envoy urges Australia to accept nuclear waste dump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The United States is urging Australia
to accept a proposal by an American company to establish a dump for
the world's nuclear waste.
	   Seattle-based company Pangea has been quietly promoting the
concept for two years.
	   It was forced to go public with its plans last week when green
groups uncovered a promotional video extolling Australia's
qualities as a dump site.
	   President Bill Clinton's special envoy on weapons of mass
destruction, Robert Gallucci, said Tuesday that the proposal would
not only be profitable for Australia but would also be a service to
the international community.
	   ``Australia could play a role in that, I think it would make a
tremendous contribution to international security,'' he told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Australia had a history of being active in promoting the
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons of mass destruction, he said.
	   ``I can't help but think that the economics would be very
favorable for a commercial arrangement that involved addressing the
needs of so many countries who do not have the geology for the long
term storage of spent nuclear fuel or radioactive waste,'' he said.
	   Gallucci acknowledged that the United States had produced much
of the world's spent nuclear fuel but said he doubted it would be
possible to site the dump there.
	   ``I don't know enough about the geology of the United States,''
he said.
	   ``But I don't think the politics in the United States would
sustain'' the idea of storing the world's nuclear waste.
	   ``We're having difficulty storing our own spent fuel ... I don't
know that we could succeed in storing the spent fuel from all the
countries.
	   ``This is fundamentally a political issue ... (based on) the
resistance of people to taking in other people's spent fuel,'' he
said.
	   Gallucci said if Australians decided the proposal was not in
their public interest that would be their right.
	   ``If I am asked, would it be of service to the international
community, do I think it could be done faithfully, my technical
knowledge, my political knowledge tells me the answer is yes.
	   ``If you ask me if this is possible in the United States, I
would tell you that politically I doubt it would be possible,'' he
said.
	   Opposition Labor Party leader Kim Beazley said countries using
nuclear power had to find ways of dealing with waste themselves
rather than dumping it in Australia.
	   ``If you decide to take on nuclear power, there is a moral
obligation on you to resolve that problem yourself within your own
borders,'' he said.

Report: North Korea building three underground launch facilities

 &UR; With UN-North Korea &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea is developing three underground
facilities capable of launching ballistic missiles, Japan's public
broadcasting network reported Tuesday.
	   U.S. spy satellites have confirmed what appear to be three
missile-launch bases under construction in the northern part of
North Korea, NHK television quoted Japanese Defense Agency sources
as saying.
	   The three facilities are being built at varying depths ranging
from 50 meters (562 feet) to 100 meters (1,125 feet) below ground,
the report said.
	   Hosei Norota, Director General of Japan's Defense Agency, told a
regular news conference Tuesday that he has ``yet to receive such
information nor confirmed'' the report, an agency spokesman quoted
him as saying.
	   The report comes as former U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry,
the newly appointed U.S. government policy coordinator for North
Korea, is on a three-nation Asian tour.
	   On Monday, Perry met South Korean President Kim Dae-jung in
Seoul. Kim proposed a ``package deal,'' in which the United States
would provide economic and diplomatic benefits to North Korea in
exchange for access to a suspected nuclear weapons site. Perry also
plans to visit Beijing and Tokyo this week.
	   Under a 1994 agreement with the United States, North Korea
agreed to abandon its suspected nuclear weapons program. In return,
it is to receive two safe nuclear reactors worth dlrs 4.6 billion
plus substitute fuel oil and other economic benefits.
	   The U.S. military believes it will be difficult for U.S.
Intelligence satellites to monitor the North's underground missile
facilities if they are completed, NHK reported.
	   The report said a fuel storage facility will be completed in one
or two years at one of the underground sites where work is
advancing the fastest.
	   Japanese were unnerved by the firing of a rocket by North Korea
on Aug. 31. U.S. and South Korean officials say North Korea test
fired its Taepo Dong-1 missile, which flew over Japan and landed in
the Pacific Ocean, proving the communist country can strike any
part of the nation.
	   North Korea has refused to accept a U.S. demand for outside
inspections of the suspected underground nuclear facility under
construction at Keumjang-ri, 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of
the North's main nuclear complex at Yongbyon.
	   U.S. spy satellite photographs taken earlier this year showed
thousands of North Korean workers burrowing into a mountainside at
the site, raising suspicion that the facility may be
nuclear-related.

ASEAN's policy of non-intervention put to the test

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug &QL;

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The longstanding pledge by
Southeast Asian nations to avoid interfering in each other's
business was put to the test recently when U.S. Vice President Al
Gore came to town and stepped into Malaysia's internal affairs.
	   In front of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, host to a
Pacific-Rim trade summit last month, Gore praised ``the brave
people of Malaysia'' for their fledgling democratic reform
movement, one that calls for Mahathir's political demise.
	   Most of the members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations came to Malaysia's defense, saying they found it
unspeakably rude that America's No. 2 leader would come to Malaysia
and spout off about Western-style democracy.
	   Even Thailand, the ASEAN member leading the call for more
cross-border criticism within the nine-nation group, chastised the
U.S. interference into Malaysian affairs.
	   ``You have to be very, very careful toward each other's
feelings,'' Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuan said.
	   When ASEAN leaders meet in Hanoi, Vietnam, for their annual
two-day summit starting Dec. 15, being very careful of one
another's feelings may be difficult. Relations within the
organization, founded in 1967 to prevent the spread of war in the
region, have been severely strained this past year.
	   Bickering between Malaysia and Singapore escalated to fevered
threats and accusations over border controls, air space and water
rights until Mahathir called a truce.
	   The Philippine and Indonesian presidents took the unprecedented
step of publicly reprimanding Mahathir for the sacking and jailing
of his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Next week, the Philippines will take issue with China, who is
sending Vice President Hu Jintao to observe the summit. The
Philippines is expected to urge ASEAN to issue a statement on the
conflicting claims over the mineral-rich atolls and reefs that
straddle vital sea lanes in the South China Sea.
	   Then there's Myanmar, also known as Burma, the newest ASEAN
member. The group has been criticized for accepting the
military-ruled country because of its dreadful human rights record,
making diplomats more cautious about the admission of Cambodia.
	   ASEAN currently comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. When
established, its goal was to bring all 10 Southeast Asian nations
into the ASEAN brotherhood; Cambodia's membership would fulfill
that pledge.
	   Cambodia was on the verge of joining ASEAN last year when Prime
Minister Hun Sen toppled his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, in a violent coup.
	   Now that a coalition government is in place in Phnom Penh, Hun
Sen has made entry into ASEAN a priority, seeing it as key to
establishing international legitimacy.
	   But Vietnam and Malaysia are the only ASEAN nations publicly
backing Cambodia's immediate entry and the membership issue is
likely to dominate the summit.
	   Non-interference into members' internal affairs could also be on
the agenda, though an attempt by Thailand and the Philippines to
alter that ASEAN founding principle was rejected when foreign
ministers met in Manila in July.
	   Surin told his counterparts that if they do not speak more
frankly about human rights and environmental issues, ASEAN would
lose credibility.
	   ``Like it or not, the issues of democracy and human rights are
those that we have to increasingly deal with in our engagement with
the outside world,'' Surin said.
	   Other ASEAN members strongly disagreed.
	   Vietnam, which as summit host is supposed to mediate disputes
and foster consensus, opposes suggestions that the time has come to
comment on neighbors' internal affairs.
	   A draft of the Hanoi Declaration obtained by The Associated
Press and expected to be presented next week indicates that Vietnam
hopes to keep the non-interference issue out on the greens: ``We
shall endeavor to resolve all our outstanding problems and prevent
the emergence of disputes in the ASEAN way.''
	   Critics of ASEAN say that's the problem. The so-called ``ASEAN
way'' has accomplished little in the past 31 years.
	   ``So long as you have some countries who do not recognize the
need for change, it will not move forward,'' said Abdul Razak
Baginda, director of the Malaysian Strategic Research Center, a
leading Kuala Lumpur think tank.
	   Abdul Razak notes that ASEAN was paralyzed during the hazardous
haze that blanketed the region last year. It stood by silently
during the Cambodian coup and the deadly riots that led to the end
of Indonesian President Suharto's 32-year rule in May.
	   And it has done little to focus on the crippling Asian economic
crisis, now well into its second year.
	   ``Clearly, ASEAN is unable to come up with some very strong
common stands,'' said Abdul Razak. ``One gets the impression that
it's every man for himself.''
	   The fledgling reform movement in Malaysia is hoping ASEAN will
chuck the non-interference policy and use the summit to discuss
Anwar, who is on trial for corruption and sodomy.
	   ``You speak about justice, universal values and human rights,
that's not interference to me,'' Azizah Ismail, Anwar's wife and de
facto leader of his reform movement, told the Thai newspaper The
Nation. ``Because those values are borderless.''
	   Mahathir disagrees. During a recent visit to Brunei, he said
Southeast Asian leaders who begin sniping at one another would
undermine regional unity.
	   ``That will be very bad, because we all have got a lot of things
to criticize about each other,'' said Mahathir, prime minister for
17 years and currently Asia's longest-serving leader.

ASEAN members split over admission of Cambodia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-ASEAN-Non-Nosy Neighbors &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID THURBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ For more than a year, the official
symbol of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations has been a
bundle of 10 stalks of rice, each supposedly representing one of
its members.
	   But only nine of Southeast Asia's 10 countries belong to ASEAN
because of its decision to postpone Cambodia's entry after a
violent coup in July 1997, just weeks before the country was to
join.
	   ASEAN's founders dreamed 31 years ago of an organization to
unite all of Southeast Asia. However, Cambodia's prolonged
political turmoil has kept the group incomplete and divided its
membership over whether Cambodia should be admitted at next week's
annual ASEAN summit.
	   ``We don't want to polarize ASEAN over the issue. There should
be consensus,'' Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul
said Monday.
	   The coup, in which Hun Sen ousted former co-Prime Minister
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, badly damaged Cambodia's international
stature. Its seat in the United Nations was suspended and several
countries halted critically needed aid programs.
	   Last week, however, a new coalition government was sworn in,
four months after disputed national elections, with Hun Sen as
prime minister and Ranariddh as president of the National Assembly.
	   The U.N. General Assembly gave Cambodia's seat in the world body
to the new coalition government Monday, and Cambodia hopes now to
convince ASEAN that it is finally stable enough to join.
	   ``Cambodia now deserves its place in ASEAN, the sooner the
better,'' Cambodian King Sihanouk said in letters of appeal sent to
all ASEAN members.
	   Vietnam, host of the Dec. 15-17 summit, has been pushing hard
for Cambodia to be admitted in time for the meetings.
	   Hun Sen is scheduled to make a state visit to Vietnam on Dec.
13-14, and hopes to stay to attend the summit as a new member.
	   ``We would like to be part of the international community, not
isolated,'' Cambodia's ambassador to Vietnam, Nuon Sareth, told
reporters in Hanoi last week.
	   Also supporting Cambodia's membership were Laos, Myanmar,
Malaysia and Indonesia.
	   Both Japan and the European Union, which provided financial
support for Cambodia's election, are also lobbying ASEAN to accept
Cambodia's membership.
	   Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines, however, say they have
reservations about Cambodia joining now, while Brunei has been
silent on the issue.
	   Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon says ASEAN should
wait until Cambodia's new political system is more firmly in place.
	   Under the coalition agreement, the president of the National
Assembly will be the acting head of state during Sihanouk's
frequent absences from the country for medical treatment. This will
require that Cambodia's opposing sides agree on a constitutional
amendment.
	   ``The fear of some (ASEAN) members is that they might fight over
that. If they fight, we in ASEAN have to intervene,'' Siazon said.
``With the many problems we have in ASEAN, Singapore, Thailand and
the Philippines believe we shouldn't hurry.''
	   Advocates of delaying Cambodia's admission also point to ASEAN's
experience with Myanmar, also known as Burma, its newest member.
ASEAN has been widely criticized for accepting Myanmar despite its
dismal human rights record, which has changed little despite
ASEAN's claim that it would be better able to encourage a member to
make reforms.
	   Both Thailand and the Philippines see the membership issue as a
way to pressure Cambodia to make reforms.
	   ASEAN's chairman this year, Singapore Foreign Minister Shunmugam
Jayakumar, says there is too little time left to decide on
Cambodia's membership before the ASEAN meetings start.
	   Jayakumar has invited foreign ministers to discuss the issue
informally at a dinner on Friday. They will then make a decision
the following day and convey their recommendation to the leaders,
Siazon said.
	   A compromise, Kobsak said, might be to delay Cambodia's
admission but urge all nations to rapidly resume aid to Cambodia,
rather than waiting for ASEAN membership as a stamp of approval.

Reports: Mahathir dismisses Soros comments on resignation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
has dismissed as unimportant remarks by American financier George
Soros, who called for Mahathir's resignation, news reports said
Tuesday.
	   Soros told a U.S. audience last week that Malaysians should
unseat their prime minister. He argued that Mahathir's policies,
which have curtailed access to the economy for foreign investors
and currency traders, are aimed at benefiting the Malaysian leader
and his cronies.
	   ``Soros can speak until he is blue in the face. It makes no
difference,'' Mahathir told a meeting of his party, the United
Malays National Organization, Monday night, according to Bernama
news agency.
	   Mahathir said the remarks by Soros would not affect investment
flows into Malaysia.
	   ``Foreign investors will come when they have the chance of
making money. ... I have no worry about that.''
	   Mahathir and Soros have clashed before.
	   The Malaysian leader singled Soros out last year as responsible
for the collapse of Malaysia's currency and its other economic
woes.
	   Soros angered Malaysian officials this time also by demanding
that former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim be released from
jail.
	   Anwar was fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 and charged with 10
counts of corruption and illegal sex acts. He has denied all the
charges saying they were fabricated to eliminate a political
challenge he posed to Mahathir.

Small plane crashes in St. Lawrence River, at least five killed

	   BAIE-COMEAU, Quebec (AP) _ A twin-engine plane with 10 people
aboard crashed in frigid waters near the mouth of the St. Lawrence
River. Three people were rescued, and five bodies were found in the
wreckage by military divers.
	   The other two people were missing; authorities said Monday their
bodies may have drifted downstream.
	   The three survivors were plucked from atop the fuselage by a
civilian helicopter and taken to the Baie-Comeau hospital. They
reportedly were suffering from fractures and shock.
	   The plane, a Britten-Norman Islander operated by a regional
company called Air Satellite, came to rest in shallow water, with
only its tail sticking above the surface. A rising tide later
covered the tail.
	   Authorities said the plane was carrying a pilot and nine
passengers. A coast guard vessel and rescue aircraft were sent to
the scene.
	   The plane went down about a mile from Baie-Comeau, on the north
shore of the St. Lawrence about 180 miles (290 kilometers)
northeast of Quebec City.
	   There was no immediate indication what caused the crash, which
was witnessed by people on shore. The regional search-and-rescue
center in Nova Scotia said it was not aware of any emergency radio
calls from the pilot prior to the crash.
	   Richard Gagne, a Quebec provincial police spokesman, said the
plane crashed shortly after taking off from Baie-Comeau en route to
Rimouksi, on the south side of the river. The St. Lawrence is about
30 miles (48 kilometers) wide at Baie-Comeau.

Gulf leaders focus on oil and Hussein at annual summit

	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A widely watched
oil-price benchmark has sunk to an all-time low as six Arab Gulf
leaders gather for an annual summit expected to focus on falling
oil prices and how to deal with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
	   The Gulf oil producers, who control about half of global oil
reserves, have been hard hit by the oil market crisis, which has
been blamed on the recession in Asia and warmer-than-usual winters.
Oil exports account for about 75 percent of their revenues.
	   Shortly before the meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council began
on Monday, January futures contracts for Brent crude _ a widely
watched benchmark _ fell to a record low of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on
the International Petroleum Exchange in London.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent.
	   The summit host, the United Arab Emirates, said Sunday that
trying to stabilize oil prices, will be the main topic of
discussion at the GCC.
	   Diplomatic sources in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, said the
kingdom would propose a GCC cartel to try to shore up prices.
	   For the first time, the three-day summit is attended by leaders
outside the group, including U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
South African President Nelson Mandela.
	   The GCC includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and
the United Arab Emirates in a federation aimed at economic and
defense cooperation.
	   Both Annan and Mandela told the opening session they hoped the
Wye River agreement, brokered by President Bill Clinton between
Israel and the Palestinians, would lead to peace in the Middle
East.
	   Annan made no mention in his speech of his talks with Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi, whom he met Saturday in Libya to try and
arrange the trial of two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a
Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for failing to
surrender the men. The United States and Britain have proposed a
trial with Scottish judges in the Netherlands _ and Annan is trying
to get Gadhafi to accept.
	   ``We are well on the way to resolving the problem,'' Annan told
U.S. Secretary Madeleine Albright by telephone on Sunday, according
to a U.N. statement.
	   The summit was also intended to discuss American and British
efforts to overthrow Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, according to
Emirates officials and Western diplomats, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   In his speech at the summit's opening session on Monday, Annan
said he was ``saddened and burdened'' by Iraq's repeated
confrontations with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before punishing U.N. trade sanctions, imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, can be lifted.
	   Iran's navy and its elite Revolutionary Guards began five days
of naval maneuvers on Friday in the Gulf. About 50,000 men and
dozens of warships are taking part.

Couples looks at every cup like it might be his last
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ One of these days, the United States
is going to play either Europe or an International team with some
cup on the line, and Fred Couples will be home watching it unfold
on television.
	   Hard to imagine a Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup without him?
	   Not to Couples.
	   Never mind he has been on every U.S. match-play team for eight
straight years, the longest current streak of any American. Forget
for a moment he is unbeaten in Sunday singles since a crushing loss
in his first Ryder Cup. Or that he built a reputation as the most
dependable _ if not exciting _ American in match play.
	   When Couples tees it up on the first day of the Presidents Cup
at Royal Melbourne, he'll start looking at these cup matches a
little differently.
	   ``I'm definitely looking forward to it from the standpoint it
might be my last Presidents Cup or Ryder Cup,'' Couples said.
``It's not going to be my last hurrah, but if I don't make the
Ryder Cup team next year, then I imagine
	   my days could be slowing down.''
	   He already has accepted the fact that his back won't get any
better. And each year that goes by is another reminder that he
isn't getting any younger.
	   Since he first had back spasms before the final round of the
1994 Doral Open, Couples has not played more than 18 PGA Tour
events a year, part of a maintenance plan to reduce the wear on his
back.
	   The reduced schedule means fewer opportunities for the former
Masters champion to earn money or points toward making the team. He
was a captain's pick for these matches, the fourth straight time he
has failed to make a team on his own.
	   And this seems to bother a guy who looks like he doesn't have a
care in the world.
	   ``I've been on a lot of teams,'' Couples said. ``In a way, I
wish I would have made them all. That way, they could have picked
someone else to play.''
	   In the inaugural year, a 20-12 victory for the Americans,
Couples clinched the cup on the 18th hole of his match with Nick
Price by hitting a 9-iron from the bunker into about 2 feet for
birdie and a 1-up victory.
	   Two years ago, he sank a 35-foot birdie putt on the 17th hole to
beat Vijah Singh in the final match of the cup.

FDA approves laser blood sugar test for diabetics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Millions of diabetics who must prick their
fingers several times each day to check their blood sugar may soon
get some relief: The government approved the first at-home laser
Monday for less painful blood tests.
	   Cell Robotics Inc.'s laser, called Lasette, uses a powerful beam
of light to vaporize a tiny hole in the fingers of children and
adult diabetics, so they can perform the blood tests vital to keep
their diabetes in check.
	   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said doctors may prescribe
Lasette for use at home in place of the tiny razors, called
lancets, that diabetics now use to prick their fingers anywhere
from four to 12 times a day.
	   ``I expect this will be a big quality-of-life deal for many
diabetics,'' said Dr. Susan Alpert, FDA's chief of medical device
evaluation. ``Patients report that it is more comfortable for them,
and they're thrilled.''
	   Diabetics' bodies cannot regulate glucose, or blood sugar.
Millions stay alive by controlling their glucose with insulin
shots, which they time by pricking their fingers to check their
blood sugar. The repeated finger-pricks are painful, particularly
on children's tiny fingers.
	   But an estimated 70 percent of diabetics fail to test themselves
daily. That neglect is dangerous _ because the tighter control
diabetics maintain on their blood sugar, the less likely they are
to suffer blindness, heart disease and other complications of the
disease.
	   Diabetics have been hoping for noninvasive or minimally invasive
ways to test their glucose levels, but that technology is at least
several years away. The laser, however, is a step toward more
pain-free testing.
	   ``The laser has the capacity to (test) without causing any of
the pain. Therefore, people are more apt to use it, ... which would
be incredibly important,'' said American Diabetes Association
President Dr. Gerald Bernstein.
	   But diabetes experts warned the laser may prove too expensive
for many patients. And even though it's just the size of a VCR
tape, it's still too big for many people to conveniently carry
around all day.
	   ``If it's atrociously expensive, it will not be accessible,''
warned Dr. Bob Goldstein of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.
	   The battery-powered laser sits on a table. Patients stick their
finger into a slot and push a button. The laser light then
vaporizes a tiny patch of skin, creating a tiny hole the same size
that lancets normally create but without the bruising that a lancet
causes, said Cell Robotics Vice President Travis Lee.
	   Diabetics then test the drop of blood that comes out, just as
they do now.
	   ``People claim they either feel nothing or feel considerably
less pain than with a lancet,'' Lee said. And patients said their
fingers weren't sore and bruised the next day, he said.
	   Scientific studies showed the laser-tested patients had their
fingers heal just as fast as other diabetics, FDA's Alpert said.
	   Cell Robotics actually makes two types of the laser. Shipping of
a specially sized, at-home version won't begin until next year. But
diabetics who don't want to wait can immediately begin buying a
larger, more complex version the company sells to doctors' offices,
for dlrs 2,000, Lee said.
	   The special at-home version will cost less, but he wouldn't give
a price.
	   A year's supply of lancets, in contrast, costs about dlrs 150.

Reports: Scientists urge Britain to allow human embryo cloning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Scientists advising the government will urge
Britain to allow some research into the cloning of human embryos as
a way of creating spare body parts for transplants or disease
treatment, British newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   But the scientists will also call for an outright ban on cloning
humans for reproductive purposes, newspapers said.
	   The recommendations, expected to be released Tuesday, come from
a scientific panel asked by the government in January to advise on
the legal and ethical aspects of cloning in light of the 1996
successful cloning of Dolly the sheep in Scotland.
	   The British media said the joint recommendations by the the
Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority and the Human Genetics
Advisory Committee were drawing immediate praise from cloning
scientists, but strong condemnation from those who fear this will
inevitably lead to human cloning.
	   ''We are seeing siblings giving parts of themselves to save a
brother or sister, with some even making organ donations,'' John
Harris, professor of ethics at the Institute of Medicine, Law and
Bioethics at Manchester University was quoted as saying in The
Times. ''If that is ethically OK, what is the difference in using
an embryo?''
	   However, Patrick Dixon, an author who has strongly criticized
cloning, called the decision out of line with what the public
wants.
	   ''Making human tissue from human embryos is repulsive to most
people,'' Dixon told the Daily Mail.
	   Scientists working on the joint report said by cloning human
embryos, researchers might be able isolate embryonic stem cells and
direct them to create replacement tissues, newspapers said. Sir
Colin Campbell, who heads the Human Fertilization and Embryonic
Authority, said the cloned tissue may someday help in the treatment
of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and leukemia by
replacing diseased tissue, and cloned organs could be used in
transplants.
	   ''Although such applications are still some years away, we
believe that it would not be right at this stage to rule out
limited research using such techniques, which could be of great
benefit to seriously ill people,'' he said.
	   Current British law outlaws human cloning and places
restrictions on research conducted on human embryos.
	   The 1990 Human Fertilization and Embryology Act says embryos
less than 14 days old may only be used for research into the
treatment of fertility problems and congenital disease. The law
does not allow research aimed at developing new forms of
replacement tissue.
	   While the panel recommends removing that restriction, it was
also expected to urge the government to introduce additional
legislation banning human reproductive cloning, British newspapers
said. The panel also recommends the issue be reexamined in five
years to take into account new scientific developments and public
attitudes, newspapers said.
	   Last week, U.N. officials called for a universal code of ethics
for cloning and genetic engineering, saying it was essential to
preserve humanity and prevent discrimination.
	   Meanwhile, in the United States, a five-year moratorium
announced by President Bill Clinton to ban cloning has apparently
been observed by most mainstream scientists, although Congress has
failed to act on the legislation.

Governors briefed on Olympic outlook, two-referee experiment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MEL REISNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ The future of National Hockey League
participation in the Olympics remained in doubt Monday despite
drawing praise during the first day of the league's annual Board of
Governors meeting.
	   Other issues discussed during the day included: this season's
two-referee experiment; overtime options to help break ties; how
well offseason tinkering has worked to increase scoring; and the
status of troubled franchises in Pittsburgh and New York's Long
Island.
	   ``We were given an Olympic update, and we're waiting to see what
arrangements we can make that would make it sensible for us to
go,'' NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said.
	   The issue has been a thorny one since the Nagano Olympics in
February. The NHL took a three-week break to allow players to skate
for their national teams, only to see CBS relegate the games to its
late-night show.
	   ``We're on a 60- to 90-day window to either do this or not,''
Bettman said. ``As a practical matter, it's got to be resolved
sometime in February, because the national federations have to put
teams together.''
	   Colin Campbell, the NHL's senior vice president of hockey
operations, said the new two-referee, two-linesman system has
streamlined games without congesting the playing area.
	   ``The flow is better and the obstruction is less,'' he said,
explaining that one referee can hang back and make sure that
players stay within the rules away from the puck while the other
skates ahead of the rush up-ice.
	   It's an advantage that Campbell believes accounts for a drop in
fighting to an average of 1.3 fights per game from 1.6 last year.
	   Officials now also are able to watch the jostling around the net
before making in-the-crease calls.
	   Bettman said the governors wouldn't decide at this meeting
whether to make the experiment permanent or use it in playoff
games.
	   ``We have it scheduled through February games,'' he said.
``There's no reason to make a judgment until all the data is in, so
if they continue to perform well we'll use it.''
	   Deterrents to the program are the cost and the amount of
training it takes to send another NHL-caliber referee onto the ice.
	   ``Can you go to 54 teams instead of 27 like that without
watering it down?'' Campbell said. ``It's not an easy business.
We're finding that out.''
	   The governors also discussed creating a dlrs 300 million
collective bargaining fund and renewed their working agreement with
the Canadian Hockey League's cluster of junior major teams.

Two sailors turn back after starting second leg of race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLESTON, South Carolina (AP) _ A broken boom and electrical
problems forced two sailors to return to Cape Town, South Africa, a
day after starting the second leg of the Around Alone
around-the-world yachting race.
	   America George Stricker was heading back to port Monday after
the boom on his 50-foot (15-meter) Rapscallion III broke in two
places.
	   He was about 76 miles (122 kilometers) from Cape Town when the
boom broke. But battling 30-knot winds, he was making only about 5
knots on his return voyage.
	   Japanese skipper Minoru Saito returned to Cape Town because of a
problem with the autopilot on his Shuten-dohji II. The autopilot
steers the boat when the skipper is asleep or making repairs.
	   Saito returned to the dock Sunday morning and was back racing
again 10 hours later. His vessel also had autopilot problems during
the first leg of the race between Charleston and Cape Town.
	   Thirteen sailors began the second leg of the Around Alone on
Saturday, pushed by westerly winds toward New Zealand.
	   The leg takes the racers on a roughly 7,000-mile (11,200
kilometers) voyage to Auckland, New Zealand, running through
churning waters of the Roaring Forties _ below 40 degrees south
latitude.
	   The racers left Charleston, South Carolina on Sept. 27. They
also will stop at Punta del Este, Uruguay, before returning to
Charleston next spring.

Heroin use up among U.S. teens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRENDA C. COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Heroin use has risen rapidly in recent years
among U.S. teens, with many middle-class youngsters snorting the
drug in the mistaken belief that it's less addictive than shooting
up, experts say.
	   The proportion of American 12th-graders who had used heroin
doubled between 1990 and 1996, from 0.9 percent to 1.8 percent,
according to a study in the December issue of the journal
Pediatrics.
	   And the rate edged up again last year, to 2.1 percent, with some
states reporting even higher percentages, said the study's author,
Dr. Richard H. Schwartz of the Inova Hospital for Children in Falls
Church, Virginia. He cited data from the federal government and
other sources.
	   While the overall share of adolescents using the drug remains
low, the highly addictive nature of heroin and the devastating
consequences of getting hooked make the trend troubling, he said.
	   Dr. Alan I. Leshner, director of the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, said the increase in heroin use is similar to that observed
for cocaine and appears to be leveling off.
	   ``There's been an increase in purity of heroin on the street,
and that increase in purity is drawing a generation of heroin
sniffers, snorters, intranasal users, rather than injectors,''
Leshner said.
	   ``They foolishly think if you don't inject it, it's not
addicting, which is incredibly wrong. And so you're seeing
middle-class, upper middle-class yuppies using heroin, where five
years ago, they wouldn't go near it.''
	   Schwartz said the average price of heroin has dropped by nearly
two-thirds, while purity has gone from 10 percent to more than 50
percent.

Thailand's `American' player quitting baseball, going home at 21
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ For William Reinsch the decision is
painful, but final.
	   The 21-year-old American, who is pitching for Thailand's
national baseball team in the Asian Games, is quitting and
returning home.
	   ``My parents came here 28 years ago and I was born here, so I am
a Thai. I am also American because my parents are Americans,''
Reinsch told The Associated Press after Thailand beat the
Philippines 6-5 in its first game in the first round of the the
five-nation baseball tournament.
	   Reinsch had torn a ligament in his pitching arm and it hurt in
Monday's game. He pitched only three innings, giving up three hits.
	   ``Probably I won't be able to pitch again in competition
matches. So it is better I quit the game and return to America,''
he said.
	   The senior Reinschs, from California, came to Thailand in 1970
for a three-month assignment for a transport company.
	   ``I liked the place and stayed on,'' said the senior Reinsch.
``It has been 28 years.''
	   He is from Fullerton, and his wife, Deborah, is from Santa Ana.
	   ``I would have liked to be a professional. But there comes a
time when you decide which way to go,'' said the junior Reinsch.
	   Reinsch braved earlier injuries playing for Thailand, but the
torn ligament has come as a final blow.
	   Two years ago, he suffered head injuries when he was hit by a
ball. That injury needed 10 hours of surgery. Further surgery on
the injury was required six months later.
	   ``I suffered in pain, but I told myself then that I will not
give up baseball.
	   ``Then came this ligament problem. I am even ignoring that. But
it looks like the day of reckoning has come.''

Olympics upset: Little-known company replaces IBM as technology

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous versions with LAUSANNE, Switzerland dateline &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sema, a relatively obscure European computer
company, beat out several leading technology firms to replace IBM
as the Olympics' chief technology sponsor, starting in 2001.
	   International Business Machines Corp., the world's largest
computer company, said last August it would end its 38-year
partnership with the International Olympic Committee at the 2000
Sydney Games.
	   Olympics organizers on Monday described the eight-year deal with
Sema, a French-English company, as the biggest sports-related
information technology contract ever awarded. While figures weren't
disclosed, the deal was believed to be worth about dlrs 220
million.
	   Sema will head a consortium of three companies in the IOC's new
Olympic Information Technology Group. The companies will provide
the computer technology and results systems for the Summer Games of
2004 and 2008, and Winter Games of 2002 and 2006.
	   The Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in 2002 will be the first
under the new technology arrangement.
	   Sema is a computer services and defense technology firm
employing 16,500 people. The high-profile tie-in with the Olympics
should put the company on the world map.
	   Sema provided information systems at the 1992 Barcelona Games
and has been involved in other sports events such as the 1994 World
Cup, the 1996 European Soccer Championship and the 1998
Commonwealth Games.
	   ``It's not a very well-known brand name, but they come to the
table with a tremendous amount of knowledge and understanding,''
IOC marketing director Michael Payne said. ``The IOC's primary
decision was to ensure we had the best technology solution and to
create as risk-free a scenario as possible.''
	   IBM was criticized for glitches in its computer results system
at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
	   The IOC said Sema will provide the systems integration,
operations management and applications delivery for the Olympics,
and help develop the IOC's Internet sites.
	   Payne said the partners for venue results management and
computer hardware will be announced in early 1999. Swiss watchmaker
Swatch is favored to win the results contract, with Compaq and Sun
Microsystems, two U.S. computer makers, in the running for the
hardware deal.
	   Payne said the three companies will contribute around dlrs 500
million in cash and services to the games as part of their
partnership, with the IOC and organizing committees putting up
around dlrs 200 million for the installation and maintenance of the
new system.
	   The contract with Sema will be signed Saturday in Lausanne by
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and Sema chief executive
officer Pierre Bonelli.
	   Payne said Sema was chosen ahead of several other leading
high-tech companies, including computer consulting giants EDS and
Arthur Anderson.
	   The IOC and IBM parted ways in an acrimonious split earlier this
year, when negotiations broke down over a new eight-year deal.
	   The IOC said an IBM demand to be paid hundreds of millions of
dollars for its services would bankrupt local organizing
committees, which IBM wanted to share technology costs.
	   IBM executives were upset by an IOC decision to seek a more
profitable sponsorship deal for Internet services and sites at
upcoming games, a role IBM held in the past two Olympics, at Nagano
and Atlanta.

Troubled African airline struggles to stay aloft

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ It's past 2 a.m. and Air Afrique
Flight 553 destined for Accra _ six hours behind schedule _ warms
up on the tarmac at Abidjan's international airport.
	   Bleary-eyed and frustrated, waiting passengers vent their anger
at Air Afrique and its all-too-common delays, cancellations and
last-minute schedule changes.
	   `I'm absolutely fed up,'' fumes Serwaah Asante, a lawyer from
Accra, the capital of neighboring Ghana. ``I won't be using them
again if I can help it.''
	   Whether anyone will be flying Air Afrique in the near future is
the looming question.
	   Beset by debt and scrambling for new investors and additional
capital, the troubled regional air carrier's fate hangs
precariously in the balance.
	   Little wonder the cooperative enterprise owned by 11 African
countries, has earned the alternate nickname of ``Air Peut-Etre'' _
French for Air Maybe.
	   Saddled with a dlrs 300 million debt, Air Afrique is desperately
seeking new buyers to bail it out and inject new cash before its
creditors close in on its assets.
	   Already, creditors have seized four Air Afrique Airbus A310s
after the airline failed to pay dlrs 57 million in arrears.
	   Without the bailout Air Afrique, once thought of as a bright
success story on an otherwise troubled continent, may be grounded
for good.
	   Like a worsening cycle, the loss of four aircraft has caused
more delays, curtailed service on some routes and put passenger
loyalty and patience to the test.
	   Air Afrique is quickly losing ground on the most lucrative
long-haul routes. For destinations in Europe and the United States,
for example, more and more travelers are choosing to fly other
airlines. Swiss Air, Belgian's Sabena, Air France and the
Netherland's KLM, among others, all fly directly from Abidjan to
Europe.
	   Air Afrique has lost 10 percent of its share of the market over
the past three years, according to company figures.
	   In response, the airline is searching for ways to win back
customers, maintain service and find more money.
	   To its credit, Air Afrique ranks among the top airlines on the
continent and has an excellent safety record, says Director General
Sir Harry Tirvengadum, a native of the Indian Ocean island state of
Mauritius.
	   Although its fleet is down to 11 planes, Air Afrique has managed
to keep 95 percent of its flights in the air, he said.
	   ``No one talks about the positive side. Restructuring an airline
is a long-term project, we can't see the results in a day,''
Tirvengadum said.
	   ``It's a miracle we've managed to keep up our services despite
the seizure of the four Airbuses, not many airlines can do that,''
he said in a telephone interview.
	   To keep the miracle going, Tirvengadum must battle forces beyond
his control: currency fluctuations, rising fuel costs and political
pressure from Air Afrique's multistate collective ownership.
	   Up to 70 percent of tickets issued to the governments of those
countries that share in the ownership of Air Afrique remain unpaid.
The reason? The airline's reluctance to tackle political leaders
who ultimately control the fate of the company.
	   Further, the airline maintains weekly flights to the capitals of
the 11 member states despite the fact that several of the routes
are not profitable.
	   But the company's real troubles began four years ago with the
devaluation of the regional currency, the CFA franc. Overnight, the
air carrier's debt burden soared.
	   Today, at least 60 percent of the airline's debt is due to the
1994 devaluation.
	   Privatization is the only course of action for survival, says a
panel of experts chaired by Tirvengadum.
	   The alternative, the panel concluded, would be the involuntary
liquidation of Air Afrique's assets. No planes, in other words,
means no airline.
	   ``The priority is to get the airline more competitive,'' said
airline spokesman Marc Amoussou Adeble, a 20-year company veteran
with the airline. ``If we can get rid of the political baggage and
find investors to sit down with us in a true partner style, we can
make headway.''
	   Air Afrique has already announced the reduction of its
state-ownership percentage, down from 70 percent to 51 percent. The
19 percent difference is to be sold on the open market, though
preferably to African investors.
	   The final step _ outright privatization _ is scheduled for the
year 2000.
	   Although some potential investors have been identified, the
airline's 4,000 employees stand to lose the most, says Sow Bayla,
head of its largest union.
	   ``The collapse of the company would be a great disaster. It
would be a step backwards,'' said Sow Bayla, head of Air Afrique's
largest union.

Johnson to go through arbitration process
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Ben Johnson's latest request to be reinstated as
a sprinter has been forwarded to the Canadian Center for Ethics in
Sports, which plans to ask the federal government for dlrs 30,000
to pay for the arbitration hearing.
	   Athletics Canada president John Thresher on Monday said the
national track body received Johnson's application for an
``exceptional circumstances'' reinstatement last weekend at the
organization's annual general meeting. The appeal was passed on to
the ethics center, which is supposed to handle such appeals for
arbitration.
	   ``Our members indicated we would support Ben Johnson's appeal
through the correct process,'' Thresher said.
	   But the Center for Ethics in Sports said it will need help
paying for the hearing.
	   ``It's going to cost something, and we're financially
challenged,'' said Victor Lachance, chief executive officer of the
center. ``I asked our accountant for records of some of the
comparable cases, and it's going to be at least dlrs 30,000.''
	   The Center for Sport and Law will select an arbitrator within 15
days. Within 30 days more, the arbitrator will meet with all
parties to determine who will participate in the arbitration. A
hearing must take place within 60 days after that.
	   ``This is an exceptional circumstances reinstatement
application, an opportunity for an arbitrator to look at the entire
picture and see if there are exceptional circumstances that would
justify reinstatement with Athletics Canada,'' said Gary Boyd,
Johnson's lawyer.
	   ``It's up to the arbitrator to determine if enough of the
suspension has been served, and do circumstances justify letting
him back in.''

Russian emigre admits role in evading $402,000 in fuel taxes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) _ A Russian emigre pleaded guilty Monday in
federal court to a role in a fuel tax evasion scheme, admitting he
helped bilk the tax collector of $402,000.
	   The plea by Yakov Volsky was the latest milestone in the
government's continuing ``Red Daisy'' prosecutions, which alleged
several separate conspiracies that defrauded the government of more
than $240 million.
	   About 40 people have been convicted or pleaded guilty in such
schemes.
	   Volsky, 50, has agreed to cooperate with investigators, said
Thomas P. Ott, the federal prosecutor handling his case. A
naturalized U.S. citizen now living in Suffern, N.Y., Volsky came
to this country 18 years ago, Ott said.
	   Volsky remains free pending sentencing March 12 by U.S. District
Judge Joseph E. Irenas.
	   He faces up to five years in prison, a $250,000 fine and
restitution, but the actual penalties would be far less, under
sentencing guidelines.
	   Volsky said he and unidentified others conspired to cheat the
Internal Revenue Service from August 1992 to January 1993 by
operating Hawthorne Petroleum of Paterson.
	   It bought tax-free home heating oil from a business actually run
by undercover agents, and eventually sold it as motor fuel, without
paying the taxes required for motor fuels, he admitted.
	   He outlined a scheme similar to that exposed in prior cases:
Using a ``daisy chain'' of fake companies involved in buying and
selling fuel to conceal nonpayment of taxes.
	   Such bootleggers can undercut legitimate dealers because they do
not pay the 30- to 35-cent excise tax the government gets on fuel
sales. Volsky admitted that invoices reflected a higher price than
actually paid, and that the purchaser got a cash kickback for the
difference.
	   Similar rackets were first exposed by undercover FBI agents who
opened their own fuel dealership in Ewing Township and were later
invited to either join in the action or close up shop. Their
operation burned down Feb. 10, 1992, under suspicious
circumstances.
	   Several cases in New Jersey have revealed that groups led by
Russian immigrants conducted many of the schemes, and in some
instances also paid ``protection'' money to the now-jailed boss of
the Gambino crime family, John Gotti.

Dollar higher against yen, Japanese stocks rise in morning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Tuesday
morning amid continued optimism about the U.S. economy. Japanese
stocks advanced moderately.
	   The dollar bought 120.34 yen at midday, up 1.38 yen from late
Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 119.81
yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 130.82
points, or 0.89 percent, to 14,854.31 points to close the morning
session. On Monday, the average finished up 83.52 points, or 0.57
percent.
	   Traders bought the U.S. currency as an overnight rise on Wall
Street boosted confidence among investors. The Dow Jones industrial
average closed at 9,070.47 points on Monday, up 54.33.
	   On Friday, the U.S. Labor Department said the nation's
unemployment rate stood at a 28-year low. That data was helpful in
diffusing increasing speculation the Federal Reserve would move to
again ease interest rates in the near future.
	   Expectations of lower interest rates put downward pressure on
the U.S. currency as reduced rates mean lower yields on
dollar-denominated deposits.
	   Sentiment for the dollar was also bolstered after U.S. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin denied a Japanese media report that he
planned to resign.
	   ``There was some sort of report out ... but it was totally,
absolutely, 100 percent erroneous,'' Rubin said Monday before
delivering a speech in New York.
	   The dollar briefly sank Monday after Japan's Sankei newspaper
quoted an unidentified U.S. government official as saying that
Rubin had told President Clinton that he wanted to step down.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices were boosted by the
overnight rise on Wall Street, with export-oriented issues leading
the way.
	   But traders remained cautious as they awaited more news on
coalition plans between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and
Liberal Party, analysts said.
	   Market players hope the coalition will result in new economic
stimulus measures, such as more aggressive tax cuts, which the
Liberal Party favors.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
exchange's first section was up 7.07 points, or 0.63 percent, to
1,132.07. The TOPIX closed up 4.28 points, or 0.38 percent, the day
before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.080 percent from Monday's finish of 1.060 percent,
driving its price down to 106.20 yen from 106.38 yen.

Fine line for what's allowed, and what's not
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNE GEARAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A farsighted entrepreneur gets an idea, works
hard, makes shrewd decisions and builds a wildly successful
company. It's the American way and Microsoft probably its
best-known recent example.
	   Yet the government says Microsoft violated antitrust laws. Its
case hinges on the fact that, even in capitalist America, companies
dominating their markets walk a special and fine line between what
they can do, and can't.
	   ``The question is what do you do with that market power?'' said
antitrust lawyer Peter J. Kadzik.
	   Say the wildly successful entrepreneur wants to make sure the
company stays on top. The company buys up some competitors, makes
deals with others and gets bigger. People keep buying its products.
So far, so good for Microsoft.
	   But then the company becomes bigger _ by far _ than all its
rivals. Understandably, it wants to keep that position and make
money. That's where the economics lesson gets complicated, and
where the federal antitrust case against Microsoft has its
beginnings.
	   The government alleges that Microsoft gained monopoly power,
then abused it by pressuring other companies and plotting to limit
competition in the growing computer market.
	   Government lawyers point out that Microsoft has 90 percent of
the market for the operating systems that run personal computers.
They claim it tried to ``crush'' rivals such as Netscape
Communications.
	   So far, testimony in the two-month-old trial has focused on
Microsoft's alleged plans to ``cut off Netscape's air supply'' and
otherwise undermine competitors.
	   But Microsoft and its billionaire chairman, Bill Gates, deny
they did anything wrong. Indeed, such tactics may sound ruthless,
but to most Americans raised on get-ahead capitalism they don't
sound illegal, antitrust experts acknowledge.
	   ``The antitrust laws have always had this internal irony,'' said
New York antitrust attorney Stephen Axinn. ``They are designed to
promote competition, which means, basically, bare knuckles duking
it out.
	   ``Yet whenever the government brings an anti-monopoly case it
seems to be arguing, 'This guy is too big and is competing too
heavily,''' Axinn said.
	   Antitrust laws are deliberately vague, and were written decades
ago to curb abuses in the old industrial monopolies such as
railroads.
	   Microsoft claims the laws don't easily apply to the new world of
high tech. The Justice Department maintains it knows a monopoly
when it sees one _ in railroads or cyberspace.
	   Yet antitrust enforcers know they walk a fine line, despite the
well-founded fear that monopolies bring higher prices and fewer
choices, said William Kovacic, a George Washington University law
professor.
	   ``The government must say, 'If you become preeminent through
superior performance, we'll give you a medal. But if you become
preeminent or protect your preeminence through improper techniques,
we will punish you,''' Kovacic said.
	   Monopoly is defined by a company's reach and its ability to
control the price of its own or a competing product. It's not
illegal to be a monopoly, but monopolies must play by different
rules.
	   To win its case, the government must prove Microsoft has a
monopoly and abused that power to both squeeze competitors and
limit consumers' choices. The latter is harder to prove.
	   ``It's difficult to say whether consumers were harmed,'' Axinn
said, although government lawyers have pointed out instances when
Microsoft allegedly deterred other companies from introducing new
or improved products.
	   Microsoft claims it is not a monopoly and that its actions have
actually promoted innovation and improved service to customers. The
company seized on the recent America Online-Netscape merger as
evidence it still faces tough competition.
	   Microsoft's lead attorney has compared federal antitrust
enforcers to Luddites, the 19th century workers who smashed
newfangled machines in a vain effort to hold onto their jobs.
	   The allegations amount to ``a repudiation of the basic principle
in our society that creative commercial activity should be
encouraged and rewarded,'' said Microsoft lawyer John Warden.
	   Microsoft's conduct against rivals may be fierce, but it's
legal, he said, adding, ``Antitrust laws are not a code of
civility.''

Rugby looks for boost from Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM WRIGHT &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ International Rugby Board chairman
Vernon Pugh has come to Bangkok to watch his sport included in the
Asian Games for the first time, and says boosting the game's
profile in the region is a top priority.
	   ``If we could increase the game's profile and the number of
competitions in Asia we'd be delighted,'' Pugh told The Associated
Press Monday at preliminary rounds of rugby sevens.
	   Rugby, a sport traditionally played in Britain and its former
colonies, must broaden its appeal in Asia to become a truly global
sport on the scale of soccer, he added.
	   And with Japan the only Asian country assured of a place in next
year's Rugby World Cup in Wales, Pugh said there is plenty of work
to be done to promote the sport in the globe's most populous
region.
	   But he called the decision to stage a rugby competition at the
Asian Games a further step forward after the sport's inclusion in
the Commonwealth Games in Malaysia this year.
	   Rugby was last played as an Olympic sport in the 1920s. There is
a chance the International Olympic Committee will reinstate rugby
for the Athens games in 2004, Pugh said.
	   Still, rugby's chief pointed to the half-empty stands at
Bangkok's Royal Thai Army Stadium for the sevens competition
Monday.
	   Japan, the country with the biggest rugby following in Asia,
trounced its opponents, beating Hong Kong 40-0 and Thailand 33-5.
	   South Korea, which is battling for a wild card berth in the 1999
World Cup, will be Japan's main rival in the 15-a-side rugby
competition that begins Wednesday.
	   The Koreans made light work of rugby novice Kazakstan in the
sweltering Bangkok heat Monday, winning 56-0. They beat Taiwan
28-12 and Sri Lanka 29-0.
	   Hoping to improve the quality of Asian rugby, Pugh said the
International Rugby Board would give financial backing to the
creation of a pan-Asian tournament along the lines of the Five
Nations championships.
	   England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France play annually for
the Five Nations trophy, but the Asian Rugby Football Union runs
only a small-scale regional competition every two years.
	   Part of the problem is funding, said Thai Rugby Union secretary
Marut Muangkoe. While sponsorship and television rights have filled
the Five Nations' coffers since rugby abandoned its amateur code,
Asian rugby unions are less fortunate.
	   ``Most of the unions in Asia are run on an honorary basis,''
Marut said, adding that Thailand's squad of mostly police and
students had paid their own air fare and expenses to play in a
recent World Cup qualifying tournament in Singapore.
	   A South Korean delegate said his union's president had paid out
of his own pocket for the team to come to the Asian Games.
	   Pugh said that although almost all of the International Rugby
Board's revenue is generated by the world's top eight teams, those
countries are willing to spread the wealth to promote rugby
globally.
	   ``These unions are happy to see a significant part of their
funding used for world development,'' he said.
	   Stephen Baines, chief executive of the International Rugby
Board, said some 300,000 pounds (dlrs 495,000) had been put into
educational packs for schools to get children playing rugby from a
young age across the globe.
	   With next year's World Cup set to generate more than 50 million
pounds (dlrs 82.5 million), almost twice the amount when South
Africa held the competition in 1995, rugby's governing body has
some money to play with, Pugh said.

American cities are developing an international outlook
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Graphic GOING GLOBAL &QL; 
 &UR; By HARRY DUNPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Las Vegas has mini-embassies in three
countries and Orlando, Florida, boasts its own foreign policy.
Denver helps support a trade mission in London.
	   To compete in the increasingly intertwined world economy, many
American cities and towns are developing new ways of promoting
themselves by going global.
	   The stakes are high.
	   Whether a city competes for a factory, a major convention,
tourism dollars, or export markets for its own businesses, the way
it reaches abroad can mean the differences between success and
failure.
	   As the global marketplace has become more cosmopolitan, cities
must possess world-class resources or lose out to their rivals at
home and abroad.
	   City activities in the global arena include maintaining
sister-city relationships with foreign towns, promoting exports,
working with their state trade offices, helping local businesses to
secure new foreign markets and a variety of cultural activities,
according to a survey by the National League of Cities.
	   ``The world may appear to be getting smaller in many ways, but
for leaders who want to move their cities ahead, the horizon looks
bigger and wider than ever,'' said Brian O'Neil, president of the
league and a Philadelphia city councilman.
	   ``While our interests may be local, things in distant places can
help make our own cities prosper or languish depending on what they
do,'' O'Neil said.
	   In recent years, his organization, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National Association of
Counties have been urging their members to think globally in
developing their economic strategies and share experiences.
	   Orlando Mayor Glenda Hood helped establish the Metro Orlando
International Affairs Commission to coordinate global activities by
government and industry in central Florida.
	   ``The commission is an example of what I call local-based
foreign policy aimed at building global economic linkages,'' she
told an international symposium earlier this year. ``If we consider
ourselves global players, then we'll act that way.''
	   Asked how her region had benefited from this approach, she said
the Commerce Department reported that the Orlando region ``was by
far the fastest growing major export market in the state of
Florida. Exports are our newest billion dollar industry.''
	   Hood said Orlando area businesses were building convention
centers in Brazil, providing medical services and managing in
Mexico and advising on theme park construction in China.
	   ``When you look at the manifest of a plane leaving from our
airport, you see products ranging from aircraft components and
computer equipment to ferns and ornamental plants heading
overseas,'' she said.
	   The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development reported that the
United States ranks No. 1 in direct investment by foreign-owned
companies, with dlrs 91 billion flowing in last year. Five million
Americans now work for foreign-owned firms and generally receive
higher wages than their counterparts at domestic firms, the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce says.
	   Metropolitan regions are spending hundreds of millions of
dollars annually in programs and incentives to attract this direct
investment to their jurisdictions to create jobs, diversify their
economies and enhance tax revenues.
	   Part of being a big-city mayor these days involves leading trade
missions overseas. Smaller cities send officials on trips sponsored
by the National League of Cities or the mayors' conference.
	   Besides trade missions, some cities have used their sister or
twinning relationship with overseas towns to build economic and
commercial bridges into international markets.
	   Cities generally rely on their state offices, U.S. embassies and
more than 130 offices of the Commerce Department's U.S. Foreign and
Commercial Service in approximately 70 countries to represent their
economic interests abroad.
	   However, Denver contributes dlrs 50,000 a year to the Colorado
Trade Mission in London to help market the city. Mayor Wellington
Webb credits the trade office for decisions by two British
high-technology consulting firms to establish their U.S.
headquarters in Denver.
	   Some cities take a more direct approach. The Las Vegas
Convention and Visitors Authority maintains representative bureaus
in Tokyo, Frankfurt, Germany, and England's West Midlands region.

28 new charges in letter bomb case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prosecutors on Tuesday filed 28 new
charges against the man accused of masterminding last week's
nationwide letter-bombing campaign, one for each bomb he sent.
	   Colin George Dunstan, 43, a suspended tax office worker, made a
15-minute appearance in the Canberra Magistrates Court where he was
charged with 28 counts of using an explosive device in
circumstances dangerous to life.
	   Dunstan has also been charged with one count of arson with
intent to endanger life.
	   The charges relate to last Wednesday's parcel bomb explosion at
the Canberra mail sorting center and the sending of 27 other
devices to tax office and human rights commission staff around
Australia.
	   Dunstan made no plea and did not apply for bail.
	   He was remanded in custody to reappear in the same court on
Friday pending a mental health assessment.
	   Wearing a navy-blue suit, Dunstan looked composed in his first
public appearance since his arrest at Royal Canberra Hospital on
Friday, where he was admitted with a slashed wrist.
	   Magistrate Ron Cahill said he wanted an assessment of Dunstan's
mental state because he was concerned Dunstan might try to harm
himself.
	   Police said Saturday that a search of Dunstan's home had
revealed bomb making items and documentation relating to people to
whom other explosive devices were sent.
	   Dunstan had been on leave from the Australian Tax Office after
having an affair with a female co-worker in 1990 and 1991,
according to court documents. He blamed this episode for the
breakup of his own marriage.
	   He apparently also blamed the tax office and various human
rights and equal opportunity officials for his troubles. Police
said the 28 letter bombs found so far were all addressed to such
authorities.

No cash or water at Asian Games, but food is great and entry free
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Will the person responsible for
supplying drinking water at the sun-scorched Asian Games please
raise his or her hand.
	   That's what perspiring, water-short athletes are asking as their
supplies run out at training sessions, according to The Nation
newspaper.
	   Teams and individuals reportedly aren't allowed to bring water
out of the Athletes' Village to training venues where the
organizers are not making deliveries. Water is supplied only during
competition.
	   The newspaper quoted one official as saying anyone who needed
more water could come and get plastic bottles at the headquarters
of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee.
	   But it said nobody at headquarters knows who is responsible for
doling it out.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NO CASH, PLEASE: The Most Valuable Player of the Asian Games
isn't going to get his or her hands on the dlrs 100,000 already
promised by a South Korean sponsor, officials have ruled.
	   By International Olympic Committee rules, prize money cannot go
to amateur athletes, but must be funneled to a winner's national
Olympic committee.
	   South Korea's Samsung Group is offering the cash prize and, with
three other sponsors, is contributing to four hole-in-one awards
for the golf event. These awards total 300,000 baht (dlrs 8,600).
	   The decision came at a meeting of the national team chiefs.
Other problems raised: fire alarms going off because of athletes
smoking, electrical cuts and the flags of Syria and Tajikistan not
being raised at the Athletes' Village.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CHAMPION CHOW: Journalists at the Asian Games are complaining
about slow results and lackluster organization, but they're likely
to award Thailand a gold medal in the food department.
	   Recalling greasy American fast food and instant noodles,
veterans of Asian Games past say they've probably never eaten
better _ or cheaper.
	   The cafeteria at the main press center offers everything from
vegetarian curries from one of Bangkok's finest Indian restaurants
to German sausages for meat eaters and specially prepared dishes
for Muslims. There also are Japanese sushi and Chinese dim sum.
	   And just down the street, nearly 100 food stalls under an
open-sided pavilion display fiery Thai dishes and shrimp still
swimming in tanks.
	   The prices are also record-breaking. A full lunch, including a
soft drink, can be savored for about 30 baht (83 U.S. cents).
	   ___ &QC; 
	   OPEN-DOOR POLICY: Hoping to fill stadiums with cheering fans,
organizers of the Asian Games are offering free access to a wide
range of sports and venues beginning Tuesday.
	   Tickets must still be bought for popular events like swimming
and athletics but most are reasonably priced, averaging 200 baht
(dlrs 5.50).
	   Offered free Tuesday will be baseball, canoeing, equestrian,
handball, field hockey, rugby, shooting, softball, squash and
yachting. Some of these sports are being staged in provincial areas
where few have 200 baht to spare.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TRADITIONAL RELIEF: Asian Games athletes under pressure to win
golds and fans fatigued by hours under the sun are being offered
relief for a mere 200 baht (dlrs 5.50) an hour.
	   To soothe stress and strain, the organizers have set up a
traditional Thai massage center at Muang Thong Thani, one of the
three major sports complexes of the games.
	   While athletes are expected to get the green light to get rubbed
down and oiled, coaches of most nations are trying to throw a
cordon around less than traditional Thai massages at thousands of
Bangkok establishments that offer sexual services.
	   Luckily for the coaches, the Athletes' Village is on the outer
edges of the city, far from night life centers like Patpong Road
and Soi Cowboy.

Greenpeace ends protest at Japanese whaling ships in New Caledonia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) _ Declaring a moral victory, four
Greenpeace activists on Tuesday unchained themselves from two
Japanese whaling ships in port in New Caledonia, ending a 28-hour
protest.
	   The four activists who had chained themselves to the catcher
vessel Kyo Maru and the whaling factory ship Nisshin Maru climbed
down from their protest perches.
	   ``Greenpeace has taken the decision to stand down as we
appreciate the French government is under pressure to remove us,
but our argument is not with France,'' Greenpeace campaigner Peter
Pueschel said.
	   ``Our argument is with Japanese scientific whaling,'' Pueschel
said.''
	   On Monday, Greenpeace protesters unfurled a ``Stop Killing
Whales'' banner and chained themselves to the two ships.
	   ``The action to delay the fleet has been successful. Greenpeace
has escalated the global debate on the sham of scientific whaling
in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary,'' Pueschel said.
	   ``Every hour that our activists remained chained to the Japanese
catcher vessel and its harpoon was an hour that the harpoon would
not kill whales in the Southern Ocean,'' he said.
	   Greenpeace said that the Japanese scientific whaling program was
a sham and an insult to science.
	   The Nisshin Maru, the mother ship, was undergoing repairs at
Noumea for engine trouble suffered when the ship caught fire last
month.
	   The fleet was due to return to Japan on Monday for further
repairs before resuming whaling in Antarctic waters in early 1999.
	   Japan catches whales for research purposes in an Antarctic
sanctuary set up in 1994 by the International Whaling Commission,
to which Japan belongs. Last April, the fleet returned with 438
minke whales, representing an estimated 1,700 metric tons of meat.
	   The Japanese whaling ships, which left Japan on Nov. 6, hope to
catch 440 minke whales this hunting season around Antarctica, the
same number caught last year.

Australian government says ``no'' to Aboriginal self-determination
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Aboriginal leaders on Tuesday
denounced federal government calls for the removal of the words
``self determination'' from an international declaration on the
rights of indigenous people.
	   The non-binding declaration is now being negotiated at the
United Nations in Geneva, but the Australian government says
self-determination might imply a right to secession.
	   Mick Dodson, a member of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander delegation to the United Nations, said the government was
wrongly suggesting Aborigines wanted to set up black states.
	   ``This is a mischievous misrepresentation of the position
domestically in Australia,'' he told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
radio.
	   ``There is not one single indigenous group in Australia who have
called for a separate nation state.
	   ``No one is calling for that and that is mischievous and
misleading to suggest that that is what indigenous Australians are
asking for.''
	   If the government wanted greater assurances of security, Prime
Minister John Howard could include discussion of the meaning of
self-determination in his preparation for a reconciliation document
with indigenous people, Dodson said.
	   ``The whole of the declaration ... is subject to international
law and there is sufficient protection for territorial integrity
available now in international law,'' he said.
	   ``But if Australia wants to be doubly safe why don't we
negotiate some arrangement, some new relationship in the context of
a document for reconciliation?''
	   Howard's government is responding to pressure from right-wing
conservatives, including those in Pauline Hanson's One Nation
Party, who claim Aborigines and the United Nations are plotting to
set up independent black states within Australia.

Court rules against boy seeking compensation over kangaroo attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A teen-age boy on Tuesday failed in his
bid to be compensated being mauled by a kangaroo at a New South
Wales golf course two years ago.
	   Fifteen-year-old Steven Shorten, of Grafton on the New South
Wales north coast, sued the Grafton District Golf Club for 750,000
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 465,000) after he was knocked down,
jumped on and gouged by a kangaroo in October 1996.
	   The kangaroo also broke his cheekbone and slashed his abdomen,
back and legs.
	   But District Court Judge Barry Mahoney ruled against Shorten,
saying it was unreasonable to expect the golf club to supervise
children using the course to prevent such attacks.
	   ``Further, I regard it as unreasonable to require the (golf
club) to either eradicate, remove or relocate kangaroos presently
on its course and to prevent those or other kangaroos from
regaining access to it,'' the judge said.
	   He said the golf club had given evidence that it would cost
90,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 56,000) to fence the course to
keep kangaroos out.
	   The judge also dismissed the boy's lawyers' arguments that the
club was liable because it had not put up adequate warning signs
about the possibility of kangaroo attacks.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Goalie Mike Richter and the New York Rangers
continued their turnaround after a slow start, beating the Toronto
Maple Leafs 6-2 Monday night in a battle of two of the National
Hockey League's hottest teams.
	   Richter made 24 saves as he extended his personal unbeaten
streak and the Rangers' team streak to six (5-0-1). In winning
their fifth straight, the Rangers climbed over the .500 mark for
the first time this season at 10-9-7 after an 0-4 start.
	   Mike Knuble, Todd Harvey, Niklas Sundstrom, Brian Leetch, Peter
Nedved and John MacLean scored for New York, which extended its
unbeaten streak against the Maple Leafs to 10 games (9-0-1).
Toronto hasn't beaten New York since Jan. 3, 1993 and hasn't won in
Madison Square Garden since Dec. 19, 1990, a stretch of seven games
(0-6-1).
	   Frederik Modin and Sergei Berezin scored for the Maple Leafs,
who had won three straight and six of their previous seven and were
tied for the second-best record in the league.

Thai police want parliament to hand over MP who injured officers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Bangkok police will ask Thailand's
parliament to hand over a lawmaker who allegedly ran down two
officers while trying to avoid getting a ticket, local papers
reported on Tuesday.
	   Deputy Bangkok Police Chief Jongrak Juthanond said police had
completed their report on the incident and would soon ask the
speaker of the House of Representatives to hand over the lawmaker,
Poonphol Asavahame, for prosecution, the Bangkok Post reported.
	   Poonphol, who is the son of Deputy Interior Ministry Vatana
Asavahame, will be charged with attempted murder, harming police
officers on duty, insulting the police, resisting arrest and
reckless driving causing injury to others, police said according to
the paper.
	   Under Thailand's new constitution, a lawmaker can not be
arrested or taken into custody while parliament is in session,
unless the legislative body gives its permission.
	   On the night of Nov. 5, police attempted to give Poonphol a
ticket because his car had no license plate or insurance sticker.
	   Policemen involved said the lawmaker refused to cooperate or
identify himself and then sped off.
	   As he hit the gas, he plowed into two policemen, one of whom
said he flipped on to the hood of Poonphol's car and was dragged
for at least 150 meters (495 feet) before the lawmaker slammed on
the brakes, throwing him to the pavement.
	   The officer suffered gashes and a concussion and was in an
intensive care unit for two days. He said he still suffers dizzy
spells and can not work a full day.

EU ministers demand close monitoring of Russian food aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union foreign ministers agreed
in principle Monday to a $460 million food aid deal for Russia but
insisted on tight controls to ensure the aid reaches the needy, not
profiteers.
	   The ministers said they wanted independent monitoring of the
distribution of the aid package, which includes hundreds of
millions of tons of grain, beef, milk powder and other foodstuffs.
They also demanded monthly reports from Russian authorities.
	   The EU must take a number of steps before the aid is freed. The
EU's executive commission is expected to finalize its aid proposal
on Wednesday, EU leaders are likely to give their political backing
at a two-day summit starting Friday, and EU farm ministers will
draw up distribution details Dec. 14.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, who chaired
Monday's meeting, said the aid would be sent gradually and would be
halted if irregularities are discovered.
	   The food aid will be sold in Russia at market prices, and
profits will be used to fund social projects, Schuessel told
reporters.
	   In November, the United States announced it would provide Russia
with a $600 million food aid package.
	   Russia's worst grain harvest in 40 years, coming on the heels of
the summer's financial collapse, has sent prices rising 50 percent.

Exhibition game set for Dec. 19 in Atlantic City
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Michael Jordan won't even be playing, and
courtside tickets will still cost dlrs 1,000.
	   A long-rumored exhibition game featuring locked-out NBA players
was finally announced Monday by agents David Falk and Arn Tellem.
	   ``The Game on Showtime'' is set for Dec. 19 in Atlantic City,
N.J., with the proceeds going to charity and to NBA players in
financial need.
	   ``If you look at people who play professional sports, not a lot
of them are financially secure,'' union president Patrick Ewing
said. ``They make a lot of money, and they also spend a lot of
money.
	   ``Me, I'm financially secure, but there a lot of others who
aren't. Our objective is to help these people. No matter how much
money they've made throughout their careers, if they're in need now
then it's up to us to try and help them,'' Ewing said.
	   Thirteen players are committed to play, and organizers hope to
have a total of 16 players who were members of the four Dream teams
_ the 1992 and 1996 Olympic teams and the 1994 and 1998 World
Championship teams.
	   Ewing, Karl Malone, Penny Hardaway, Tim Hardaway, Allan Houston,
Reggie Miller, Alonzo Mourning, Tom Gugliotta, Gary Payton,
Dominique Wilkins, Vin Baker, Glen Rice and Mitch Richmond have
committed.
	   Among those who have not are Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Charles
Barkley, Scottie Pippen, Isiah Thomas, Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem
Olajuwon, Grant Hill and John Stockton.
	   Derrick Coleman and Larry Johnson, members of the 1994 World
Championship team, were not invited.
	   Jordan's absence is particularly noteworthy because Falk, his
agent, is one of the main organizers.
	   ``Michael has said he won't make a decision about returning to
professional basketball or retiring until the lockout is over,''
said Curtis Polk, president of Falk's sports management company.
``We did talk to Michael about the game, obviously, and Michael
feels he needs to stand by his earlier statement that he'll wait
for a resolution of the lockout before he makes that decision. He
wouldn't want to send the fans a sort of mixed message by his
participation in this game.''
	   Ewing said Jordan might show up, but won't play.
	   The Atlantic City game will be the latest in a recent string of
exhibitions involving locked out players. Games were held last
weekend in Miami and Dallas, and another is scheduled for next
Sunday in Los Angeles.
	   Jay Larkin, executive producer of Showtime, would not reveal how
much the cable network was paying for the broadcast rights.
	   Polk said the largest expense would be insurance, with every
player covered for dlrs 20 million against a career-ending injury.
	   None of the players will be paid, and no criteria have been
established for determining which players will share in the
proceeds.
	   ``We would rather have the players participating in NBA games,''
deputy commissioner Russ Granik said. ``That's why the owners have
made a proposal to the union that guarantees players' salaries will
continue to grow and remain the highest in pro sports.''
	   Mourning said they're not asking for the fans' sympathy and
added that few people realize how many financial obligations
players have. The lockout, now 23 weeks old, has caused the first
two months of the season to be scrapped. No new negotiations are
planned.
	   Organizers hoped to raise at least dlrs 1 million in proceeds.
The game will be held at the Atlantic City Convention Center, which
seats about 17,000. Tickets will cost from dlrs 25 to dlrs 1,000.

Witness described illegal sex to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Before firing his deputy for
immorality, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad called in a person who
alleged he was sodomized by Anwar Ibrahim to get a first-person
account, a trial court was told Tuesday.
	   Azizan Abu Bakar testified at Anwar's trial that police asked
him to go to Mahathir's Kuala Lumpur residence late at night for a
meeting which lasted more than one hour.
	   ``The police told me that the prime minister wanted to know the
true story,'' said Azizan, a former employee of Anwar who alleged
the then deputy prime minister repeatedly forced him into sodomy, a
crime in this predominantly Muslim nation.
	   The witness said he had told Mahathir during the Aug. 24 meeting
that the allegations against Anwar were true.
	   Anwar is on trial on four counts of abuse of power, and will be
tried later on another charge of corruption and five charges of
committing illegal sex acts.
	   He has denied any wrongdoing, calling the charges part of a
high-level conspiracy to ruin his political career.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2, saying he had determined Anwar
was morally unfit for office. The sacking led to demands for
political reforms and massive anti-government protests in the
normally placid Southeast Asian capital.
	   Soon after Anwar was dismissed, Mahathir told reporters he had
personally spoken to many people with whom Anwar was alleged to
have illegal sex so that he could gauge the accusations himself.
	   But he had not disclosed details of such meetings.
	   Azizan, a former driver for Anwar's wife, startled the court
Monday by agreeing with a defense lawyer who said Anwar had never
sodomized him.
	   But as the cross-examination continued Tuesday defense lawyers
did not press him on the retraction.
	   It was not clear whether Azizan had gone back on his testimony
or he had simply misunderstood the defense lawyer's question.
	   If the defense discredits Azizan's testimony, it could be a
major blow to prosecutors who have based the most serious charge of
illegal sex acts mainly on Azizan's accusations.
	   Azizan had accused Anwar of forcing him into sodomy in 1992. He
told the court last week that shame and guilt kept him from making
Anwar's repeated homosexual acts public until 1997.

Ruling party to release tapes of meeting which expelled Anwar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
governing party will sell audio tapes of the meeting at which
leaders expelled former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim from
the party, news reports said Tuesday.
	   The United Malays National Organization decided to make the
proceedings public because tapes of excerpts from the meetings were
already being widely sold in the country.
	   ``Now, we allow copies of all four original tape recordings of
the meeting that day to be made available to anyone who wants to
listen to them,'' Mahathir said after a meeting of party managers
on Monday night.
	   In the unauthorized cassettes being sold in the market, parts of
Anwar's speech had been erased to project a better image of the
jailed politician, the official news agency, Bernama, said.
	   Several versions about what happened at the Sept. 3 meeting,
held one day after Anwar was fired by Mahathir, have been
circulating. While UMNO officials have said the decision to expel
Anwar was unanimous, Anwar's allies insist there were several who
disagreed with Mahathir's decision.
	   Anwar is charged with 10 counts of illegal sex and corruption.
He is facing trial now on four of these charges.
	   Mahathir said the party would not distribute these cassettes
free. ``Anyone who wants to listen to them will have to buy them
... our party has no money now.''
	   Monday's meeting also expelled two party members for their
involvement in Anwar's campaign for political freedom in Malaysia.
	   The party is studying complaints against 47 others who have
expressed sympathy for Anwar.

U.S. envoy urges Australia to accept nuclear waste dump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The United States is urging Australia
to accept a proposal by an American company to establish a dump for
the world's nuclear waste.
	   Seattle-based company Pangea has been quietly promoting the
concept for two years.
	   It was forced to go public with its plans last week when green
groups uncovered a promotional video extolling Australia's
qualities as a dump site.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy on weapons of mass
destruction, Robert Gallucci, said Tuesday that the proposal would
not only be profitable for Australia but would also be a service to
the international community.
	   ``Australia could play a role in that, I think it would make a
tremendous contribution to international security,'' he told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Australia had a history of being active in promoting the
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons of mass destruction, he said.
	   ``I can't help but think that the economics would be very
favorable for a commercial arrangement that involved addressing the
needs of so many countries who do not have the geology for the long
term storage of spent nuclear fuel or radioactive waste,'' he said.

Report: Judge who ruled on Pinochet linked to Amnesty
</HEADLINE>
International &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ One of the judges who ruled that Gen. Augusto
Pinochet does not have immunity from arrest on charges of genocide
and torture has links to a human rights group, The Guardian
reported Tuesday.
	   Law Lord Leonard Hoffman has been an unpaid director of Amnesty
International Charity Ltd. for seven years, the newspaper said.
Last week, The Guardian reported that his wife, Gillian, works as
an administrative assistant for the charity's London-based parent
organization.
	   The newspaper said that the former Chilean dictator's lawyers
were hoping to overturn the House of Lords ruling on the basis of
these connections.
	   Amnesty International has been a major voice in the campaign for
Pinochet to stand trial in Spain, which is seeking his extradition
for killings and tortures by security forces during his 17-year
regime.
	   The five-member Law Lords, Britain's highest court, ruled in a
3-2 decision on Nov. 25 that Pinochet does not have immunity from
arrest, paving the way for Spain's extradition request to move
forward.
	   Lord Hoffman was one of the three justices who voted against
Pinochet's request for immunity. Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in
his hospital bed in London after undergoing back surgery during a
regular visit to Britain. He is now staying under police guard in a
rented house outside of London.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw must decide by Friday whether to allow
extradition proceedings to go ahead _ the same day that Pinochet is
scheduled to appear before Bow Street Magistrate's Court in London.
	   The Guardian said Lord Hoffman's involvement with the charity
was disclosed by Amnesty International on Monday after requests
from the general's lawyers. The newspaper reported the organization
also said the judge was involved in a 1997 Amnesty International
fundraising campaign for a new building.
	   Lord Chief Justice Thomas Bingham, whose earlier ruling that
Pinochet had immunity as a former foreign head of state was
overturned by the House of Lords, had also been involved in the
fundraising appeal, the newspaper reported.
	   The Amnesty International Charity was set up in 1986 to pay for
research and educational work into human rights issues. The
directors meet informally to review finances and prioritize future
projects, the newspaper said.
	   ''The charity does not have any involvement in the human rights
campaigning of Amnesty International, and has not had anything to
do with the crisis over Pinochet,'' The Guardian quoted an
unidentified source from the charity as saying. ''I can only assume
that Lord Hoffman decided there was no reason to declare his
interest in the charity, though it is easy to see how people could
draw the wrong conclusions.''
	   Pinochet's lawyers could not be reached for comment.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule after he overthrew
Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   Meanwhile, about 100 relatives of soldiers and policemen killed
in anti-government attacks after Pinochet seized power were
expected to present a petition Tuesday to Prime Minister Tony
Blair's office calling for Pinochet's release.

Japan's Obuchi encourages world peace on Pearl Harbor anniversary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Pearl Harbor &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Tuesday
pledged continued efforts toward world peace on the 57th
anniversary of Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.
	   Japan's military attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, dragging
the United States into World War II. The war ended with Japan's
unconditional surrender on Aug. 15, 1945.
	   ``By learning from history, we established a constitution that
renounces war to settle international disputes,'' Obuchi told
reporters, according to Kyodo News.
	   ``This is the day when Japan renews its pledge to devote itself
to making efforts for world peace over the future,'' Obuchi
reportedly said at the Prime Minister's residence.
	   The Japanese surprise attack killed 2,290 U.S. military
personnel at bases throughout Hawaii and 48 civilians.
	   The constitution imposed by the United States after World War II
bans using force to settle international disputes. But a 1992 law
allows Japan to dispatch troops to join U.N. peacekeeping
operations under certain conditions.

Greenpeace ends protest at Japanese whaling ships in New Caledonia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) _ Declaring a moral victory, four
Greenpeace activists on Tuesday unchained themselves from two
Japanese whaling ships in port in New Caledonia, ending a 28-hour
protest.
	   The four activists who had chained themselves to the catcher
vessel Kyo Maru and the whaling factory ship Nisshin Maru climbed
down from their protest perches.
	   ``Greenpeace has taken the decision to stand down as we
appreciate the French government is under pressure to remove us,
but our argument is not with France,'' Greenpeace campaigner Peter
Pueschel said.
	   ``Our argument is with Japanese scientific whaling,'' Pueschel
said.
	   On Monday, Greenpeace protesters unfurled a ``Stop Killing
Whales'' banner and chained themselves to the two ships.
	   ``The action to delay the fleet has been successful. Greenpeace
has escalated the global debate on the sham of scientific whaling
in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary,'' Pueschel said.
	   ``Every hour that our activists remained chained to the Japanese
catcher vessel and its harpoon was an hour that the harpoon would
not kill whales in the Southern Ocean,'' he said.
	   Greenpeace said that the Japanese scientific whaling program was
a sham and an insult to science.
	   The Nisshin Maru, the mother ship, was undergoing repairs at
Noumea for engine trouble suffered when the ship caught fire last
month.
	   The fleet was due to return to Japan on Monday for further
repairs before resuming whaling in Antarctic waters in early 1999.
	   Japan catches whales for research purposes in an Antarctic
sanctuary set up in 1994 by the International Whaling Commission,
to which Japan belongs. Last April, the fleet returned with 438
minke whales, representing an estimated 1,700 metric tons of meat.
	   The Japanese whaling ships, which left Japan on Nov. 6, hope to
catch 440 minke whales this hunting season around Antarctica, the
same number caught last year.

Thai Education Ministry: teachers watching soap operas in class
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Satellite equipment meant for
instructional use may be confiscated from some of Thailand's
schools because teachers are using it to watch soap operas in
class, an Education Ministry official said on Tuesday.
	   A survey of more than 12,000 schools nationwide found that 913
were using the equipment inappropriately, with many classes
watching soap operas and other entertainment programs, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Other schools weren't using the equipment at all, keeping it
locked up because they feared it would be stolen.
	   Economists have said that Thailand's antiquated education system
is a major weakness in the country's efforts to achieve sustainable
development and produce a workforce capable of handling
higher-technology jobs.
	   The contract to sell satellite equipment to Thai schools was
heavily criticized by some for its high cost and the fact that the
supplying company was owned by Thaksin Shinawatra, who at the time
was a deputy prime minister, raising questions of conflict of
interest.

Quake rocks Indonesian town, no reports of injuries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An earthquake jolted parts of
southeastern Indonesia on Tuesday, causing panicked residents to
run out of their homes. There were no reports of damage or
injuries.
	   The 5.5-magnitude quake at 6:37 a.m. (2337 GMT Monday) was
centered in the sea 46 kilometers (29 miles) northwest of the town
of Ende, Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics Agency said.
	   Ende, which lies on the island of Flores, is 1,620 kilometers
(1,000 miles) east of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
	   In December 1992, a magnitude-7 quake caused tidal waves that
killed at least 2,500 people and damaged thousands of buildings in
Ende and several neighboring towns.
	   Indonesia, the world's largest archipelago nation, is prone to
seismic upheavals because of its location on the Pacific ``Ring of
Fire,'' a series of volcanoes and fault lines from North America
through Japan and Southeast Asia to the South Pacific.

All Black dies in diving accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand international rugby
union player Aaron Hopa died Tuesday in a scuba diving training
accident on the Coromandel Peninsula, police said.
	   Hopa, 27, is understood to have drowned while completing a
diving course with other members of his Waikato rugby team.
	   Loose forward Hopa played four matches, but no test matches, for
the All Blacks during their tour of Britain late last year.
	   Sgt. Brian Wotton of Whangamata police said Hopa was pronounced
dead after he had received cardio-pulmonary resuscitation for about
50 minutes.
	   Wotton said Hopa was diving with seven other members of the
Waikato rugby team as part of a diving course he had started on
Oct. 12. (djp)

Haitian exiles seek trial for former dictator Duvalier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Haitian exiles in France have created a committee
to seek a trial for former dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, better
known as ``Baby Doc,'' on charges of crimes against humanity.
	   ``It is our duty to make sure Jean-Claude Duvalier is tried for
the memory of the 60,000 victims of his regime and that of his
father Francois,'' said Gerald Bloncourt, the founder of the
committee,
	   It may not be easy for the committee, which was founded
Saturday, to see that Duvalier has his day in court.
	   The French Ministry of the Interior says it has ``lost track''
of Duvalier, 47, who it says has ``probably'' left French
territory.
	   Named president for life at age 19 following the death of his
father in 1971, Duvalier has lived in France since 1986 when he
fled his native Haiti. Duvalier's Paris lawyer, Sauveur Vaisse,
said Duvalier ``was still living in France'' without saying where.
	   Vaisse also said Duvalier had been shocked at recent press
reports comparing him with Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet,
who remains in custody in England while Spain seeks his
extradition.
	   ``For the time being, Jean-Claude Duvalier is not the object of
any complaint of this type in Haiti or in France,'' said Vaisse.
	   Duvalier was allowed to enter France by then Socialist Prime
Minister Laurent Fabius, who is now president of the National
Assembly.
	   His father, Francois, known as ``Papa Doc,'' had ruled Haiti
with an iron hand since 1957 with the help of the Tontons Macoutes,
his private militia. Tens of thousands of people were massacred and
tortured to death during the 31-year father-and-son dynasty, which
ended when ``Baby Doc'' fled after several weeks of demonstrations.
	   The French Ministry of the Interior says Duvalier has never had
a residency permit for France, while the Foreign Ministry says he
had ``territorial asylum,'' which allows the government
discretionary power to allow whomever it wants to reside in France.
	   ``France is still protecting Jean-Claude Duvalier,'' said
Bloncourt in an interview. ``He comes and goes freely and all the
authorities claim to ignore where he is, that's impossible.''
	   Duvalier lived for a time on the Cote d'Azur and then following
financial difficulties moved to the Paris region in 1993, where his
father-in-law lived. Haitian exiles claim that Duvalier was seen in
Paris in mid-1998.
	   Duvalier allegedly lost a large part of his fortune when he was
separated from his wife, Michele Bennett. The couple have two
children.

Homeless man dies after attack by three teen-agers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A homeless man died of a brain hemorrhage Tuesday
nearly a month after suffering a midnight assault by three teen-age
boys, police said.
	   The man, whose identity remains unknown, was attacked as he
slept in the yard of the city hall in Kakogawa, about 500
kilometers (310 miles) southwest of Tokyo, the prefectural (state)
police said.
	   The victim, who was believed to be about 60, fell unconscious as
the three boys repeatedly kicked him in the head and shot him with
an air gun, police said.
	   Under the nation's juvenile law, the identities of the boys were
not disclosed. The three were arrested the day after the attack.
	   Kyodo News quoted one of the boys as telling police he wanted to
test the air gun he just bought.
	   The police spokesman, who spoke on customary condition of
anonymity, said an autopsy is planned to determine whether the
death of the homeless man was directly linked to the injury.
	   Japan has been deeply disturbed by a recent wave of violent
crimes committed by juveniles. On Monday, a 15-year-old boy was
arrested after allegedly stabbing a schoolmate, apparently to vent
his frustrations about his school work.

Asian Games' tiniest nation bows out, dream unfulfilled
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Asian Games' tiniest member, a
cluster of coral islands in the Indian Ocean, departed from the
event without being able to fulfill its very modest wish _ just one
soccer victory.
	   ``For our nation it would have been fantastic to win just one
match,'' said Ahmed Shahir, manager of Maldives soccer team.
	   Maldives, a soccer-crazy nation of about 250,000 people who live
on 202 inhabited coral islands scattered some 800 square kilometers
(320 square miles) across the equator, played in the preliminaries
with 22 other teams. But it was eliminated without a single
victory.
	   So crazy are the Maldivians about soccer that they chartered
four Indian cargo ships to bring tons of sand and thousands of
slabs of green grass to make proper soccer fields.
	   The soccer fields are in the capital, Male, but even today
players on other islands wait for low tide to start so that they
get more space to practice.
	   The players often sustain injuries and the shoes don't last more
than three months as Maldives sand contains coral that pierces
them.
	   The nation, made up mostly of Sunni Muslims, holds a kind of
soccer World Cup record: it lost 17-0 to Iran in the first round of
the World Cup qualifiers earlier this year.
	   Putting behind that soccer humiliation, the Maldivian
government, headed by South Asia's longest reigning leader,
President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, drew up a 12-year soccer training
program that involves even under-age 12 teams.
	   The country sought the help of former Rumanian star Victor
Stanchules and former Uzbekistan player Solokho Vyacheslay as
coaches. Four tournaments are held annually.
	   ``I worked hard on the team for the Asian Games,'' said coach
Vyacheslay, 52.
	   ``But I do have problems, but they are funny ones,'' he added,
referring to Maldivians' passion for eating mounds of rice.
	   ``I tell them don't eat so much rice, eat more protein. But
every time I see them dining, I look at their plates and there is
the heap of rice,'' he said.
	   In Bangkok, Maldives had one small consolation.
	   Although the team lost to Qatar 4-0 and Tajikistan 3-0, that was
better than Mongolia's 15-0 rout by Uzbekistan.

Hong Kong action hero No. 1 at Asian Games

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Martial arts are a medal sport at the
Asian Games but probably drawing larger audiences is Jackie Chan,
the karate-chopping Hong Kong action star who is packing them in at
the Athletes' Village.
	   Although the village movie theater has a schedule of some 40
Hollywood films, Chan's hit film ``Rush Hour'' is No. 1 with some
7,000 athletes from 41 Asian nations.
	   Second in popularity, according to the games' official
newspaper, is Chan's ``Who am I?''
	   Also attracting large numbers of athletes are the karaoke room
and video parlor, where just about every sports game is available,
including virtual skiing.
	   Skiing is not on the games schedule in tropical Thailand.
Taekwondo, judo and wushu _ the martial arts of Korea, Japan and
China _ are.

Record Australian cocaine haul

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Four people charged over the
importation of Australia's biggest cocaine haul -- 495 pounds (225
kilos) seized from a yacht -- appeared in court Tuesday and were
jailed pending trial.
	   They were Robert Scott Flavel, 28, of Florida; Beatriz
Gonzalez-Betes Suarez, 38, of Spain; Jose Manuel Campillo Vaquere,
34, of Adelaide; and Gregory Paul Meggett, 28, of South Africa.
	   The four appeared in Coffs Harbor Local Court following the
seizure of 495 pounds (225 kilos) of cocaine from a yacht off Coffs
Harbor on Monday. All were charged with importing cocaine and
ordered to reappear in court Monday.
	   A police spokesman said it was believed the ketch Maeva,
carrying cocaine with an estimated street value of 50 million
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 30 million), had started its journey
in South America.
	   The drugs seized Monday afternoon had been stored in a dinghy
attached to the vessel, the police spokesman said, adding the bust
followed a six-month undercover operation.
	   It comes two months after federal police, customs and the navy
smashed an
	   international drug ring and recorded Australia's largest ever
drug haul.
	   On October 14, during a pre-dawn raid on a beach on the New
South Wales mid-north coast, south of Port Macquarie, 880 pounds
(400 kilos) of high-grade heroin was seized.
	   Eighteen people, including seven Hong Kong Chinese nationals and
11 Indonesians, were arrested.
	   The previous record cocaine haul was in 1994 when 383 pounds
(174 kilos) were found in the northern Sydney suburb of Artarmon.

Report: Thai Interior Ministry advocates lethal injections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Interior Ministry wants to
use lethal injections to execute prisoners instead of shooting them
and will propose legislation to allow the change, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   Ministry officials said they are pushing for the change to
stifle criticism from international human rights groups that accuse
Thailand of brutality for shooting its condemned, according to The
Nation.
	   Prisoners are executed by a single marksman. They are tied to a
wooden cross with their backs to the shooter.
	   Ministry officials said there are 52 prisoners on death row. Two
people have been executed this year, while 279 have been put to
death since capital punishment was instituted 63 years ago, the
paper quoted the officials as saying.

Seoul to revive multi-billion dollar air-defense plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea will revive a dlrs 2.3
billion plan to build a new air defense system to replace its aging
American missiles, Defense Ministry officials said Monday.
	   The officials quoted their minister, Chon Yong-taek, as telling
military leaders Monday night that the missile system will be
upgraded ``as soon as possible.''
	   South Korea has been planning for some time to replace its
Nike-Hercules missile defense system, first deployed in the 1960s,
but put the project on hold this year because of the nation's
financial crisis.
	   The decision to revive the project came after a Nike-Hercules
antiaircraft missile was accidentally fired into busy commercial
airspace over the western city of Inchon on Friday.
	   An interim report indicated the missile's built-in
communications system malfunctioned and triggered the firing. Two
similar accidental firings of the same type of missile occurred in
1997 and 1980.
	   Officials are considering replacing the Nike-Hercules missiles
with U.S. Patriot missiles or Russia's S-300 missiles.
	   Military officials reportedly prefer Patriots, but their price
tag of dlrs 700,000 per missile is a third more than the cost of
the Russian missile.
	   South Korea buys most of its military hardware from the United
States, but in 1996 it rejected U.S.-made Stinger air-defense
missiles and bought 1,000 French-made, shoulder-mounted Mistral
missiles for dlrs 300 million.
	   Meanwhile, President Kim Dae-jung reprimanded the defense
minister Tuesday for a recent series of military accidents,
including Friday's missile firing, and ordered him to punish the
officers responsible.
	   Other recent military-related accidents included an explosion
Saturday of a recoilless rifle shell at a front-line army barracks
that killed three soldiers and wounded five others.
	   An 83-year-old woman was injured Sunday when a stray flare
shell, fired by a marine unit, fell on her home north of Seoul.

Chen Yan out of 200-meter event
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's world champion swimmer Chen
Yan, badly beaten in her main event at the Asian Games, pulled out
of the 200-meter freestyle Tuesday because of diarrhea.
	   Chen, the world record holder for the 400-meter medley, was
relegated to third by Japan's Yasuko Tajima and China's Wu Yanyan
on Monday.
	   She didn't swim in Tuesday's freestyle heats, and coach Han
Mingyan said she was in doubt for the 200-meter medley, where Wu is
world champion.
	   ``She had the trots last night,'' Han said Tuesday. ``We sent
her to the village clinic this morning to receive some treatment.''
	   ``As she is rather weak now, whether she will continue to
compete in the games is still in doubt, not to say winning gold,''
Han added.
	   Chinese head coach Zhang Xiong said he expected Chen to enter
the women's 200-meter medley. ``I'm sure she will take part in that
event,'' Zhang said.
	   Tajima, third behind Chen at the world championships earlier
this year, said she noticed something was wrong with Chen after the
race. The Chinese swimmer started poorly, finishing the opening
100-meter leg in fourth before fighting back to second at the final
turn. But a weakened Chen labored down the stretch as Wu claimed
silver.
	   Chen's illness gave the rival Japanese team a boost.
	   ``The mediocre form plaguing Chen will give us more chances to
win,'' said Japanese team chief Tsuyoshi Aoki.
