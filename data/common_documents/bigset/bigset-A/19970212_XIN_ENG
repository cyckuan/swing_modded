<HEADLINE> US Productivity Increases 0.8 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. productivity
increased by 0.8 percent in 1996, the best showing in four years,
the U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the advance in the U.S. non-farm
productivity, which measures output per hour of work, was more
than double the 0.3 percent gain in 1995.
</P>
<P>
It is also the best showing since productivity shot up by 3.2
percent in 1992, the year after the 1990-91 recession.
</P>
<P>
However, it was far below the typical increase in the decades
after World War II.
</P>
<P>
The productivity in the U.S. often rose more than 2 percent a
year in the 1950s and 1960s. Since the early 1970s, its gains have
been averaging around 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. productivity at the end of last year improved
markedly. It was up by 2.2 percent in the final three months of
1996, the best in three years. The productivity was unchanged in
the third quarter, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The department said unit labor costs -- which take account of
both hourly wages and productivity -- rose at a 1.4 percent annual
rate in the fourth quarter, down from the 3.3 percent rise in the
previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
For the year, unit labor costs rose 2.9 percent, the same as in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The productivity is the key measurement oement in American
living standards.

Earlier, a special commission headed by Tajik vice-premier
Abdurakhmon Azimov had been instructed to work out a mechanism on
exchanging the hostages for 40 supporters of the Sodirov brothers.

<HEADLINE> France Strongly Condemns Ethnic Violence in Mostar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- France today "very strongly"
condemned the ethnic violence that took place in the Bosnian city
of Mostar, which Paris said was threatening the process of
reconciliation in the town divided between Muslims and Croats.
</P>
<P>
"These incidents conflicted with the efforts made by the
international community and by the European Union in particular in
this city," said French Foreign Ministry vice-spokesman Yves
Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 200 French soldiers and 150 Spanish soldiers
belonging to the Stabilization Force (SFOR) of NATO have been
dispatched to Mostar to reinforce a Spanish unit of the SFOR and
prevent new clashes between Muslims and Croats.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted SFOR spokesman
Lieutenant-Colonel Bayle as saying in Mostar that a company of
French soldiers, backed by light armored vehicles, have been
patrolling the streets of Mostar and stationed at some places
considered as sensitive.
</P>
<P>
The reinforcement came after a Spanish unit of the SFOR failed
to put under control the violence between Muslims and Croats in a
Croat district of the city Monday.
</P>
<P>
The violence started after Croat police shot dead a Muslim man
to disperse a cortege of Muslims, who were going to a cemetery in
a Croat district to pay homage to the tombs of their parents
buried there, after the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Arrests Two Ruling Party Legislators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Two South Korean National
Assembly members of the ruling New Korea Party (NKP) were arrested
by the prosecution here tonight on charges of taking graft and
exerting influence in connection with the Hanbo loan scandal.
</P>
<P>
Hong In-kil, who has been secretary to South Korean President
Kim Young-sam since the seventies, was accused of having received
a total of one million U.S. dollars from Hanbo Business Group
General Chairman Chung Tae-soo on four occasions last year -- with
the request that he exercised his influence on banks so that Hanbo
could obtain loans easily.
</P>
<P>
Chung Jae-chull, chairman of the NKP's national convention, was
charged with receiving 100,000 U.S. dollars from Chung Tae-soo in
October 1995.
</P>
<P>
The local press reported that the Hanbo leader asked Chung
Jae-chull to give money to the lawmakers of National Congress for
New Politics (NCNP), the main opposition in South Korea, hoping
they would promote banks giving loans to the Hanbo Iron and Steel
Company.
</P>
<P>
Chung Jae-chull allegedly handed the money to NCNP legislator
Kwon Roh-kap, conveying to him the message from the Hanbo leader.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prosecution issued a summons to Kwon Roh-kap
this afternoon, telling him to report to the prosecution by
tomorrow morning or face arrest.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said Chung Tae-soo poured huge amounts of money
into politicians' pockets in the process of financing his project
to set up a steel mill in South Korea's southern Chungchong
Province.
</P>
<P>
Chung Tae-soo was arrested by the prosecution on January 31 on
charges of fraud and embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
He had secured six billion U.S. dollars in bank loans between
1992 and 1996 without sufficient collateral for his flagship firm,
Hanbo Iron and Steel Company. The company was declared bankrupt by
its creditors on January 23 after failing to honor billions of
U.S. dollars in notes.

<HEADLINE>   UK Tories Plan Major Education Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain will undergo education
reforms designed to raise and guarantee standards, British Prime
Minister John Major and Education and Employment Secretary Gillian
Shephard said today.
</P>
<P>
In the third of a series of pre-election press conferences
today, Major set out the Tories' plans for education reforms.
</P>
<P>
He said the nation's schools would be set targets each year to
improve the number of General Certificated Secondary Education
(GCSE) passes, and the levels of literacy and numeration.
</P>
<P>
At present, only 45 percent of 15-year-olds get five GCSEs at
grades between starred A and C.
</P>
<P>
The aim would be - over a number of years - to nearly double
that figure, said Major.
</P>
<P>
Higher targets would also be set for the testing of younger
children. Currently 57 percent of 14 year olds, 58 percent of 11
year olds, and 80 percent of seven year olds had achieved the
level set for their ages.
</P>
<P>
Schools would also have to set targets to allow comparisons to
be drawn with rivals and international standards. All parents
would be given information on how their children were doing at
school.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Shephard said that "All the Government's education reforms
were designed to raise and guarantee standards. The quality,
consistency and reputation of qualifications were a key part of
that drive on standards."
</P>
<P>
The annual report, published by British government last
February, said that Britain had suffered from a low standard
education system for decades. Standards needed to be raised in
half the 20,000 primary schools and two-fifths of the 3500
secondary schools,
</P>
<P>
Education reforms are one of focus topics in Britain before the
 general election due to be held in May this year. Both Tory and
Labor regard this as their priority.
</P>
<P>
Labor leader Tony Blair promised on January 12 to make the
education of the nation's children his "first priority" if Labor
won the general election.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to revolutionize Britain's schools as
radically as Margaret Thatcher reformed trade union law in the
1980s. He said secondary school children would be required to do
at least 90 minutes' homework everyday, and seven to 11-year-olds,
30 minutes'.

<HEADLINE> EU Lobbyists Call for Road Safety Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The EU lobbyists have called
for mandatory speed limits on major European roads and random
breath tests as two of a package of safety initiatives to cut
20,000 from the European Union's annual road death toll, it was
learned today.
</P>
<P>
The call for safety measures came Monday from the European
Transport Safety Council as it started a campaign to get EU
governments committed to cutting annual road deaths from the
current 45,000 to 25,000 people by the year of 2005.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than half of those killed recently
have been car users, while those on two-wheeled motor vehicles and
pedestrians each accounted for about 15 percent of deaths.
</P>
<P>
Freddy Blak, a Danish member of the European Parliament, said
that two million people, mainly young people under the age of 25,
obtained driving licences each year but about 2,000 of them were
killed on the road within a year.
</P>
<P>
He is urging the European Commission to devise an action plan
"in response to this clearly unacceptable situation."

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Official statistics released
today showed a total of 10,877 people applied for asylum in
Germany last month, with 6 percent of the applications approved.
</P>
<P>
The number of asylum seekers registered an increase of about
2,700 persons over December, probably due to seasonal causes,
according to the Federal Interior Ministry.
</P>

Of these people, the largest group were Turkish nationals,
totaling about 2,300 persons. They were followed by more than
1,400 Iraqis and nearly 1,100 people from the Federal Republic of

<HEADLINE> Chirac Rejects Israel's Proposal on Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today rejected a proposal by Israel on replacing Israeli troops
with a French inter-position contingent in southern Lebanon to
separate Israel from the pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Chirac was quoted as saying during a meeting with Lebanese
Prime Minister Rafic Hariri that France is opposed to a unilateral
solution to the conflict in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"France will not send inter-position troops to southern Lebanon
if the Israelis withdraw from there in a unilateral way," said
Hariri following his talks with Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese prime minister, who is a close friend of Chirac,
said that the position of France is that one should go back to the
negotiating table to seek a global peace agreement between Israel,
Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the French presidential office said that Chirac
reaffirmed the "land for peace" principle for solving the Middle
East conflict, which he presented during his tour of the Middle
East last October.
</P>
<P>
Israelis Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu has ruled out the
possibility of withdrawing Israeli troops from the Golan Heights,
which Israel seized from Syria and annexed after the 1967 Middle
East war.
</P>
<P>
Some Israeli parliament members proposed last week that Israeli
troops withdraw from southern Lebanon and be replaced by a French
contingent, after a clash of two Israeli military helicopters
killed more than 70 Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
French Ambassador to Israel Jean-Noel de Bouillane de Lacoste
rejected the proposal, saying that Israel must sign a peace
agreement with Syria first.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French Defense Minister Charles Millon will start an
official visit in Israel Wednesday to "renew" defense cooperation
between the two countries, which was first launched in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Air Raids Against Guerrillas in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes carried out
this afternoon a series of air raids on guerrilla targets in the
Hezbollah-controlled Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon, reportedly
wounding seven people.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that four Israeli jet fighters, covered
by six other warplanes, launched an air offensive at targets on
the outskirts of the Shiite Muslim stronghold of Baalbek city
in eastern Lebanon at 1:15 p.m. (1115 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The Israeli warplanes fired four air-to-surface missiles in
the direction of a radio station of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah,
or Party of God, on a hill and badly damaged the building.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses in Baalbek said that they saw black smokes rising
into the sky from the hilltop and covered the area, and
explosions echoed across the city.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said, on a condition of anonymity, that
at least four people were wounded in the air raid.
</P>
<P>
A group of people in Hezbollah's black uniforms set up
blockades around the hill and preventing reporters and others
from approaching, and ambulances were witnessed rushing to the
scene.
</P>
<P>
The fundamentalist Hezbollah, which spearheads a guerrilla
warfare against the Israeli occupation in south Lebanon, denied
that any of its members were wounded by the Israeli warplanes.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth air raid by the Israeli air force at the
"Sawt Mutabasin" radio since November 1992.
</P>
<P>
The radio resumed transmission one hour after the attack.
</P>
<P>
In another air raid, Israeli warplanes attacked a base of a
radical Palestinian organization only five kilometers west of the
Syrian-Lebanese border, injuring three Palestinian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Local security sources said that two Israeli helicopters
carried out the attack on a base of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestinian (PFLP) at Yagoub in western Beqaa and
wounded three members of the organization.
</P>
<P>
The security sources also reported that Israeli helicopters
fired missiles at a base of the PFLP at Naameh in western Beqaa,
without causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army spokesman announced in Jerusalem that Israeli
warplanes launched two air strikes on targets in western Beqaa
in southeast Lebanon "not far away from the Syrian border."
</P>
<P>
The air strikes came two days after Hezbollah guerrillas
ambushed an Israeli patrol in the Israeli self-proclaimed
"security zone" in south Lebanon, injuring seven Israeli
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by Muslim guerrillas and bombardments by
Israeli forces constitute a daily scene on the last active
battle front of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in south Lebanon in 1985 in a bid to protect northern Israel from
cross-border attacks.

People's Assembly in September 1992 before the re-start of the
civil war, would not remain a UNITA member of the parliament,
according to the Angolan News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Fatima claimed she would not abandon her parliament
membership, but UNITA said the former party official, who fled to
the Portuguese capital of Lisbon in 1993 after the restart of the
civil war, had no right to remain a UNITA party member.
</P>
<P>
Only the UNITA leadership has the power to appoint its own
members to the parliament and the national unity government,
which are soon to be inaugurated, said the UNITA announcement,
adding that "any attempt to disrupt this practice would put the
peace at stake."
</P>
<P>
A UNITA announcement to this effect was also released in
Lisbon, where Fatima is still staying, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, UNITA also expelled Honorio Van-Dunem, Norberto De
Castro and Waldemar Correia, who were also elected members of the
People's Assembly in 1992, from the party, and dismissed their
UNITA parliament memberships.
</P>
<P>
Angola's much-delayed peace process is still moving ahead with
the formation of a united army nearly completed, UNITA members of
parliament soon to arrive at the capital, and differences
narrowed between the former rivals over power sharing in the
government.

<HEADLINE> French Oil Firm to Enter Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Ring Oil International, a
French oil company, is going to invest 200 million U.S. Dollars
as a ticket to enter Nigeria, Africa's largest oil-producing
country.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said the money will be used as a "seed
fund" for Ring Oil's Nigerian affiliate, which intends to bid for
the planned upgrading of the Nigeria's ailing refinery industry.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Ike, the Managing Director of the company, said Ring Oil
also plans to establish a refinery plant in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, the company's immediate focus will be the
purchasing and selling of Nigeria's crude oil, oil lifting,
production of artificial synthetic fibers and chemicals like
methanol.
</P>
<P>
It plans to be involved in the prospecting and production of
oil, said Ike, adding that his company is also interested in
acquiring part of the Nigerian government's interest in existing
oil producing joint ventures when it eventually decides to sell
the equity holdings.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is a member of the Organization of Petroleum Export
Countries (OPEC) and the largest oil-producing country in Africa.
At present, it produces about two million barrels of crude oil
daily.
</P>
<P>
The government has the monopoly over the petroleum industry
through the state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
(NNPC). Foreign oil firms can only operate in Nigeria through
joint ventures with the NNPC.
</P>
<P>
Ring Oil will be the seventh foreign oil firm to operate in
Nigeria, after Mobil, Shell, Cheveron, Agip, Texaco and Elf.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Reform Military Commanding System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- South African Defense
Minister Joe Modise today announced a plan to reorganize and
restructure the military at its top administrative levels.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming reform will include transferring of military
commanders and creating a new Ministry of Defense, Modise was
quoted by the South African Press Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Defense Minister Ronnie Kasrils said the
military reform will create a mechanism that the secretary for
defense and the chief of the National Defense Force would operate
at the same hierarchical level under the Defense Minister.
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary will play a role of departmental policy
adviser and the chief of armed forces will serve as departmental
military adviser.
</P>
<P>
Kasrils said the military reform is aimed at creating a more
effective and streamlined head office as well as saving 66
million U.S. Dollars of military budget.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the local press quoted Reg Otto, chief of the South
African Army, as saying that the armed forces in the country
would drastically disband and amalgamate its units as part of a
cost-saving exercise in the military services.
</P>
<P>
The downsizing of the armed forces would allow the army to
comply with budgetary restrictions while maintaining and
promoting combat efficiency, Otto said.

HARARE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The clearing house of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) is under
restructuring in line with international trade developments, an
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Davison Marape, acting executive secretary of the clearing
house, said the changes would include the introduction of a new
payment system in April.
</P>
<P>
He said a unit of account for payment of trade transactions
would be introduced by member states through the clearing house
based on the U.S. Dollar as opposed to the current arrangement
based on the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) of the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The system would automatically introduce a flexible exchange
rate system and replace the rigid system currently in place, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the clearing house was also
undertaking an aggressive education campaign to the business
community, banks and government institutions to popularize the
system in all sectors of the economy.

HARARE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will this year import
five million male condoms and 420,000 female condoms for public
distribution as it intensifies preventive and control measures
against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Zimbabwe's National AIDS Coordination
Programme Coordinator, Everisto Marowa, at a one-day consultative

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- High freight costs, now
representing 50 percent of input costs of Zimbabwe's flower
growers, are eroding the viability of the industry, exporters
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Mary Dunphy, administrator of the Export Flower Growers
Association of Zimbabwe, said freight costs varied from airline
to airline and prices per km ranged between 21 to 23 U.S. Cents.
</P>
<P>
"This is a high rate bearing in mind that for some flowers,
this will constitute 50 percent of the input costs. So we would
like to get that price lower," she said.
</P>
<P>
She added the harsh winter in Europe had also affected
business, and flower exports were reduced.
</P>
<P>
The association, which exports 70 percent of its products to
Europe and to the auction floors in the Netherlands, last year
exported 12,800 tons of flower worth about 39.3 million U.S.
Dollars.

<P>
An estimated 16,000 tons of export was expected this year, she

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the Lesotho
Defense Force, Makhula Mosakeng, today warned renegade policemen
against taking any further action to pose a threat to stability
of the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today from Lesotho's capital of Maseru
quoted Mosakeng as saying that the army will play an important
role to end a week-long police mutiny.
</P>
<P>
But he said the police officers involved should refrain from
moving around heavily armed and in full combat gear.
</P>
<P>
The police officers should also immediately return all
vehicles they have seized, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mosakeng also called on other policemen who joined the mutiny
to return to their posts without delay.
</P>
<P>
The warning comes after last Thursday's seizure of the police
headquarters in Maseru by the mutinous officers.
</P>
<P>
The rebellious policemen dismissed six senior officers,
including the commissioner of police who was at the time out of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The renegade policemen have been resisting arrest for the 1995
murders of three fellow policemen who allegedly demanded amnesty.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Modern life and inadequate or
incorrect information are largely responsible for the sexual
problems of Greeks, according to the findings of a recent
epidemiological study presented today by the Hellenic Sexology
Association.
</P>
<P>
The findings were presented prior to the first conference to
be held in Greece on contemporary sexology issues.
</P>
<P>
According to the study carried out by the Institute of Sexology
and Patras University, one in 10 Greeks has a sex problem, 60
percent of which concern premature ejaculation while 40 percent
are erection-related.
</P>
<P>
The picture is even gloomier when it comes to women, since it
is estimated that one in four fail to attain sexual satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of women fail to reach orgasm, while many
women report diminished sexual desire.
</P>
<P>
According to Salonika University professor of obstetrics and
gynaecology Z. Papathanasiou, the causes of most of the problems
in men and women are psychological.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the low birth rate in Greece, Gynaecologist M.
Kardamakis said that 20 percent of men over the age of 35 do
not want children, while two out of 10 couples living in cities
want but are unable to have children.

LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Output prices of manufactured
goods in Britain rose only by 0.2 percent in January, giving a
year-on-year rise of 1.5 percent, the lowest level since October
1986, official figures showed Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that the figures,
much better than the increase of about 0.5 percent expected by the
City, suggest there is little inflation pressure on the industrial
front at present and reinforced Chancellor of the Exchequer
Kenneth Clarke's decision not to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Input prices, or the costs of fuel and raw materials, fell 0.5
percent between December and January, leaving prices 6.2 percent
lower than a year ago, also a 10-year low, due largely to the
strength of the pound.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said that two of the largest contributors to the fall
in import prices were imported metals, the price of which fell
almost 15 percent in the past year, and pulp and waste paper
prices, which dropped by 42.7 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- British Airways reported record
pre-tax profits for the nine months to December as it started
celebrations to mark the 10th anniversary of its privatization
today.
</P>
<P>
At 933 million US dollars, pre-tax profits were 9.2 percent
higher than the comparable period last year and took the
post-privatization total to 5.2 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the occasion, the airline today offered a 16 US
dollar return fare on 10 seats on every Concorde flight for a
period of 10 days. The usual fare is 8,640 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
British Airways shares, brought by the public when Lord King
was chairman at 200 cents in an offer which was 11 times
oversubscribed, began trading on the Stock Exchange 10 years ago
today, leaping to an instant premium of 85 cents.
</P>
<P>
Since then the shareholder register has been reduced from 1.1
million to 235,000, but those investors who have stayed the course
have seen a minimum investment of a 400 US dollar increase in
value to 2,048 US dollars, including dividends.
</P>
<P>
Colin Marshall, chairman of the airline, said the airline was
on course to achieve its target of 1.6 billion US dollars worth of
savings over a three-year period.
</P>
<P>
Robert Ayling, chief executive, refused to discuss details
about the size of the savings but promised more details with the
full-year figures in May.
</P>
<P>
Since privatization, British Airways revenues have topped 8
billion US dollars while the company has paid out more than 960
million US dollars in tax and 1,280 million US dollars in
dividends.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Salonika, the second largest
city in northern Greece which has been declared cultural capital
of Europe this year, will have its long history of civilization
shown on specially drawn-up maps by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The city's cultural capital organization has prepared an
ambitious program to locate, study, record and display dozens of
archeological sites buried under that northern port city.
</P>
<P>
The program, entitled "the city under the city," will be
carried out with the cooperation of the three antiquities
departments responsible for ancient, Byzantine and historical
monuments and be completed by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
At an estimated cost of over 500 million drachmas (208 million
U.S. dollars), part of which is hoped to be secured from European
Union funds, the program will divide Salonika according to
historical periods.
</P>
<P>
Special maps will be drawn up for each period, resulting in an
archeological atlas of the city.
</P>
<P>
Although no real excavation work will be carried out, Roman and
Byzantine monuments, walls and churches will be "revealed" through
scientific research, drawings and models.
</P>
<P>
"Our target is during 1997 to present, with adequate
documentation, about one-fifth of Salonkia's historical center,"

<HEADLINE>   Amir's Former girlfriend Indicted for Assisting in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Margalit Har-Shefi, former
girlfriend of Yigal Amir who assassinated former Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, was indicted today for abetting Amir in
the murder.
</P>
<P>
The indictment, which was filed in Tel Aviv Magistrate's
Court, charged Har-Shefi with failing to prevent Rabin's murder
and giving Amir the means of committing crimes.
</P>
<P>
Amir shot with a pistol and killed Rabin on November 4, 1995,
after the former premier attended a mass peace rally in Tel
Aviv. He is now serving life sentence after being convicted of
murder.
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, Har-Shefi knew about Amir's plan
to murder Rabin but failed to notify proper authorities; and she
also provided Amir with information on committing anti-Arab
activities.
</P>
<P>
Har-Shefi, a 20-year-old student from Beit El, was detained
two days after Rabin's assassination, but was released after 17
days later.
</P>
<P>
She admitted having heard about Amir's plan to assassinate
Rabin, but argued that she doubted that he would really commit
it.
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the two accounts of crimes, Har-Shefi will
face up to five years in jail. Today's charge came following the
State Attorney's Office's decision Monday to indict her.
</P>
<P>
Har-Shefi's indictment was filed 15 months after Rabin's
murder. The Justice Ministry explained that the delay was due to
two reasons: Har-Shefi was a witness in the conspiracy trial of
Amir and his brother Haggai, and the State Attorney's Office did
not want her testimony to be compromised.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, because six people were being investigated on
similar charges, the investigation involved a lengthy amount of
cross-checking.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the five other people investigated have been
cleared of charges of conspiracy in the Rabin's murder due to
insufficient evidence.

<HEADLINE> UK Parliament on IRA Bomb Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Security measures at
Westminster have been tightened after a warning that the Houses of
Parliament could be the target of the IRA attack.
</P>
<P>
It was officially announced that from Wednesday, entry into the
Houses of Parliament on foot is to be severely restricted.
</P>
<P>
Commons pass-holders also face spot checks and bag searches
because security chiefs fear there are IRA "sleepers" in the
building.
</P>
<P>
"They are worried about the enemy within -- people working at
the Commons whom nobody has suspected," said a senior government
official.
</P>
<P>
The restrictions are being imposed after an MI5 warning that
IRA terrorists are monitoring the comings and goings at the
Commons and continue to view MPs and Parliament as possible
targets.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to all Commons staff, MI5 said security
measures were being introduced or reinforced because the building
remained at a high level of threat from the IRA.
</P>
<P>
Although there is understood to be no specific threat to
Westminster, security chiefs regard the run-up to the election as
a highly sensitive time in which the IRA might be tempted to mount
an attack.
</P>
<P>
At the weekend the IRA leadership said it was "highly unlikely"
there would be a fresh cease-fire in the run-up to the election,
and denied that it was engaged in a phoney war.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique scored a good

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of cholera
victims who were admitted in hospital in the Tanzanian capital
Dar es Salaam has decreased from 17 to six by today, indicating
successful control of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Dar es Salaam City Commission (DCC) Commissioner for Health
Matiku Nyakarungu told reporters here today that four patients
are remaining at Amana Hospital and two others were at the newly
established Cholera Emergency Center at Kipawa area in the city.
</P>
<P>
"Three of them could be discharged at any time from now
because their condition has highly improved. They are only
waiting for final results," he said.
</P>
<P>
The DCC commissioner for health said the newly cholera
emergency center established at the most affected area of Kipawa
last Saturday has contributed greatly in controlling the disease.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, health officers also conducted mass
education to the public over the epidemic and distributed
essential drugs from house to house in the city.
</P>
<P>
However, Nyakarungu cautioned city residents to keep their
premises clean, boil drinking water, eat hot food and wash fruits
with clean water before eating.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if health rules are not observed, heavy loss of
human lives is likely to occur with the approaching rains as
floods will spread the germs "vibrio choleras".
</P>
<P>
Cholera erupted on January 19 in Kipawa and Buguruni areas in
the city, whereby 17 out of the 32 people who were suffering from
diarrhoea were diagnosed cholera positive and admitted in
hospital.

<HEADLINE> Developed Countries Want UNEP to Be "Exclusive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- An Indian official has said
that some developed countries aimed at turning the U.N.
Environmental Program (UNEP) into an "exclusive club" at the
just-suspended 19th session of the UNEP Governing Council.
</P>
<P>
In an article issued here today, Indian High Commissioner to
Kenya T.P.L. Screenivasan noted that the controversy during the
session was about the merits of an existing democratic system of
governance as against an exclusive club.
</P>
<P>
Since the last session, developed countries have been calling
for a review of the UNEP governing structure while drastically
reducing their contributions to the UNEP, said the Indian
official who is one of the vice-presidents of the UNEP Governing
Council meeting opened on January 27.
</P>
<P>
At the insistence of some developed countries, UNEP Executive
Director Elizabeth Dowdeswell proposed the creation of an
Executive Board to implement decisions adopted by the Governing
Council.
</P>
<P>
But, Screenivasan pointed out, the proposal was unanimously
rejected by the developing countries because it struck at the
very root of democratic decision making system at the Governing
Council.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the set-up of a small Executive Board as an
inter-sessional body would deprive the great numbers of the
Governing Council members of the opportunity to have their say in
the UNEP administration.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure from the West major donors, the developing
countries have agreed in principles to establish a high level
committee if it is open to all member countries, said
Screenivasan who is chairman of the Committee of Permanent
Representatives to the UNEP.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, one concession on the part of the
developing countries led to a demand to set up another group for
reform to manage UNEP affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Indian official pointed out that the message from the 19th
session was that the UNEP would be reshaped by the powerful
nations in accordance with their own vision and priorities.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, he called on developing countries to take
united actions to ensure that the UNEP remains relevant to the
environmental needs of the whole world.

<HEADLINE> UN Security Council Condemns Killing in Mostar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council today strongly condemned the killing of a
civilian in the divided Bosnian town of Mostar earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued at the end of the consultations of the
15-member council said that all the member states of the council
"condemned in the strongest possible term the discriminative
killing of one civilian in Mostar today."
</P>
<P>
The council demanded that "those responsible for the acts be
identified, be arrested and brought to trial," the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
The statement also called on all responsible citizens in Mostar
to "remain calm and maintain peace."
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the members of the Security Council would
continue to follow closely development of the situation in Mostar.
</P>
<P>
The incident came only one day after Bosnian Croats reportedly
opened fire on a crowd of Moslems visiting a cemetery in Mostar
Monday. At least four people were wounded, an international police
spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The shooting and killing followed rising tensions over the
past month in Mostar between Moslem and Croat communities.
</P>
<P>
The violence has coincided with political battles inside the
Moslem-Croat federation over power-sharing and budgets.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Moslems and Croats fought a vicious 10-month war in
1993-94 until they agreed to form the federation under heavy U.S.
pressure.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Defend Culture Against US Incursions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Canada will use every weapon in
its arsenal to fight U.S. assaults on its cultural policy, said
Heritage Minister Sheila Copps.
</P>
<P>
"If the Americans want to enter a good dialogue on good policy,
we're prepared to do it," Copps said at the end of the country's
two-day culture summit here.
</P>
<P>
"But don't lecture the most open market for cultural products
in the world with the kind of one-way denunciations that we've
seen emanating from the U.S. trade representative," she warned.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government "is prepared to use all the tools in
our arsenal to fight decisions that restrict our capacity to build
our own culture," the minister vowed.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans are playing hardball on the issue of the (World
Trade Organization) and magazine. Well, we can play hardball too,"
she was quoted as saying by reports today.
</P>
<P>
The summit was designed to review existing policies and new
ways to protect its culture when the U.S. is mounting bigger
efforts to crack open the border for its cultural products.
</P>
<P>
The meeting became all the more urgent to the Canadian cultural
industries, after the WTO ruled last month that Canada should
change its policies protecting the domestic magazine industry.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government will appeal the WTO ruling, Copps told
the meeting of country's largest cultural industries and
institutions.
</P>
<P>
She also revealed that the government "is looking at whether
there are other instruments we can use to protect our magazine
industry."
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, next week's federal budget will
include a 7.4 million U.S. dollar broadcast fund for CBC radio
and a loan guarantee program for Canadian book publishers.

The FTSE index on the London market ended 3.4 points down at

French stocks also finished slightly lower, dragged down by
profit-taking and overnight falls on Wall Street, but firm bonds
and the stronger dollar tempered losses, with the CAC-40 index
13.28 points down at 2,582.09.

In Frankfurt, German shares posted slim gains with support

LUSAKA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Zambia
today dismissed an opposition application challenging the
qualification of President Frederick Chiluba to contest the
presidential elections held last November.
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice Matthew Ngulube, sitting with other six supreme

<P>
Five opposition parties are challenging Chiluba's nationality

The five opposition parties include the Zambia Democratic

Kenneth Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
Under the new constitution signed by Chiluba, those whose
parents are foreign immigrants cannot contest the presidency.
</P>
<P>
The UNIP and some other opposition parties boycotted the
elections held under the constitution, which factually barred
Kaunda from running for the presidency because his parents are
Malawian immigrants.

Aqaba, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Energy Ministry was seeking international bidders by April
30 to construct, operate and own the projected plant, whose
capacity is designed to be 210,000 barrels per day (bpd).

<HEADLINE> Great Lakes' Water Levels Could Drop Drastically, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Rising consumption and the
effects of global warming could cause a reduction of over 25
percent in the amount of water flowing out of the Great Lakes,
according to a new study by two environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
The drop would occur over 40 years if no actions are taken to
make farmers, businesses and consumers rethink their "outrageous"
use of water of the lakes.
</P>
<P>
They could drop even further if major diversion projects are
approved to move water from the Great Lakes to parched areas of
the United States, the report warned.
</P>
<P>
North America's Great Lakes are the largest freshwater system
in the world, containing 23,000 cubic kilometres of water. Some 33
million people live around or near the lakes.
</P>
<P>
A major drop in Great Lakes water levels could harm animals,
lake freighters and hydroelectric stations, said the report by
Great Lakes United and the Canadian Environmental Law Association.
</P>
<P>
Drastically lower levels would also dry up wetlands used by
waterfowl, change beaches and decrease shorefront property values,

<P>
ULAN BATOR, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian Defense Minister
Dorligjav today denied allegations that Mongolia would allow the
presence of United States forces in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, he told the Mongolian News Agency that Mongolian
cooperation with the U.S. and NATO would not harm the interests of
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
This statement came as rumors over Mongolian-U.S. military
cooperation circulated among the foreign diplomatic corps in this,
the world's largest land-locked country.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Mongolia and the U.S. have begun to enhance
cooperation in the military field. They signed an agreement on
military exchanges and visits last June, following heated debate
in the Mongolian State Great Hural.
</P>
<P>
When asked about his visit to Russia earlier this month, the
minister said Russia voiced its respect towards Mongolian defense
policy in the new period.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two sides signed a non-aggression treaty
and agreed to hold a joint military exercise in fighting natural
disasters this summer.

<HEADLINE> France's Public Deficit Drops 28 Bln Francs in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- France's public deficit dropped
by 28 billion francs (5 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996 to stay at
295 billion francs (53 billion U.S. dollars), Minister of Economy
and Finance Jean Arthuis announced today.
</P>
<P>
The figures represent 4.1 percent of the gross domestic product
(GDP) of France, higher than 3 percent of GDP as is required by
the Maastricht Treaty signed by the European Union (EU) countries
for joining the single European currency euro.
</P>
<P>
France has to further lower its public deficit to 3 percent
this year to join the euro in the first wave, scheduled for
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac today congratulated the
government on having controlled public spending over the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
He called for further cutting of public spending, which
includes spending by the state, by the social security system, and
by local communities.
</P>
<P>
Althuis said that the increase of public spending in 1996 over
1995 stood at 1.7 percent, for the first time below the country's
inflation rate, which stood at 2 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that the public debt of France continued to grow
in 1996, and said that France has to cut its public deficit to 2
percent of GDP to decrease its public debt.

<HEADLINE> Japan's PM Apologizes Over Radioactive Bullets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today apologized to the Okinawa prefectural government
over belated notification about radioactive bullets fired by
United States Marines a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto made the apology at a session of the House of
Representatives Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Marine Corp. jets fired a total of 1,520 radioactive
bullets on Torishima Island off Okinawa during training exercises
in December,1995 and January,1996. Washington informed the
Japanese foreign ministry of the incident last month.
</P>
<P>
Under U.S. Marine regulations, the use of radioactive bullets
is prohibited in any places in Japan, including the uninhabited
island of Torishima.
</P>
<P>
The belated notification prompted Okinawa Governor Masahide
Ota, an outspoken critic of the U.S. military presence in the
prefecture, to fiercely criticize the U.S. military and the
Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
At the lower house session, Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda
acknowledged that the government had neglected the impact of the
incident on Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa, about 1,600 kilometers southwest of Tokyo, accounts
for only 0.6 percent of the country's total land area while
accommodating 75 percent of the U.S. military presence in Japan.

<P>
LANZHOU, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A girl who could not afford
medical treatment has regained her health thanks to donations
from her doctors.
</P>
<P>
About a month ago Fang Yuxiu, a farmer's daughter in
northwest China's Gansu province, was sent to the Provincial
People's Hospital for treatment for heart disease.
</P>
<P>
To save the girl an operation costing at least 8,000 yuan
(nearly 1,000 US dollars) was necessary.
</P>
<P>
This was far beyond what the family, living in Jishishan
county, the poorest county of Gansu, could afford. So, the doctors
contributed the money between them and the operation was performed
promptly and smoothly.
</P>
<P>
"My life was saved by these warmhearted doctors, and they have
taught me how to care for and love others," said Fang, tearfully,
when she left the hospital on the eve of the traditional spring
festival.

TOKYO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today welcomed the start of direct talks between the
Peruvian government and heavily armed rebels holding 72 hostages
at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima, Kyodo News
reported.
</P>
<P>
"There is a meaning in having started talks in any form, I'm
relieved." the news service quoted Hashimoto as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Even as we have so far talked under the surface of the water,
there were many parts which were not conveyed to the families of
the hostages."
</P>
<P>
The first round of the so-called preliminary dialogue took
place Tuesday for about four hours at a private home across from
the diplomatic compound in Lima.
</P>
<P>
The face-to-face talks between Peruvian Education Minister
Domingo Palermo and Roli Rojas, the No.2 man among the rebels
inside the residence, were aimed at finding a peaceful end to the
58-day-old standoff.
</P>
<P>
They reportedly adopted procedures for future dialogue and
agreed to continue talking in accordance with a schedule to be
agreed upon later.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement seized the
Japanese ambassador's residence on December 17, taking hundreds of
hostages. Most of them were released later but the 72 people are
still held captive.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A number of chain bookstores
have quietly appeared in this capital of south China's coastal
Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
The manager of the "Rainbow Bookstore", which has six branches
here, attributes this to the booming of the book market in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
"This year I plan to open two more branch bookstores," he said.
</P>
<P>
The chain bookstores, generally 30 to 40 sq m in area, have the
advantages of relatively-low investment and risk in addition to
being able to spread to every corner of the city.
</P>
<P>
Some of the chain bookstores are housed in supermarkets. When
books are standing side by side with such daily consumer items
like eggs and vegetables, it is very convenient to choose
something to read, one bookstore head said.
</P>
<P>
The manager of a chain bookstore sponsored by the "Guangzhou
Daily" said that his bookstore is very helpful in enhancing the
relationship between the paper and its readership in terms of
understanding the readers' interests.
</P>
<P>
"We will strive to improve our service, for everything we do
for our customers will pay dividends in such a competitive
market," he said.

<P>
BONN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Germany's petroleum import
expenditure soared by 28.5 percent in 1996 due to higher oil
prices on the world markets, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Frankfurt-based Federal Economic Office,
Germany imported 102.9 million tons of crude oil in 1996, an
increase of only 2.2 percent over 1995, but that volume cost 23.9
billion marks (about 15.9 billion U.S. dollars), an increase of
28.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Russia surpassed Norway as Germany's top oil supplier for the
first time in 1996, with the export of 26 million tons as against
22 million tons from Norway.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Libya and Saudi Arabia were the third, fourth and
fifth largest oil suppliers for Germany in 1996 with deliveries of
18 million, 12 million and six million tons respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Germany got 39 percent of its crude

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan launched a new rocket
today carrying the world's first radio telescope satellite into
space, said the Education Ministry's Institute of Space and
Astronautical Science.
</P>
<P>
Minutes after the lift-off from a launch in the town of
Uchinoura, Kagoshima Prefecture, southwestern Japan, the 830
kilogram Muse-B satellite separated from the rocket and was put
into elliptical orbit around the Earth.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will link up with ground-based telescopes to
probe major sources in the galaxy, such as distant quasars and
black holes.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, which uses radio astronomy technology, has a
life expectancy of at least three years.
</P>
<P>
It was placed in orbit with an apogee height of 20,000
kilometers and a perigee height of 1,000 km to observe radio
sources such as quasars and masers in cooperation with radio
telescopes on Earth, over a period of three to five years.
</P>
<P>
The satellite's magnifying power for celestial bodies is
equivalent to being able to see from Tokyo a grain of rice in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The M-5 rocket is the fifth generation of M-series rockets. The
30-meter, three-stage rocket, developed by the institute, is
capable of launching a satellite weighing up to 1.8 tons.
</P>
<P>
The rocket was designed to match increasing demands for larger
payload capacities and is powerful enought for missions to Mars,
Venus and outlying asteroids.

<HEADLINE> EU Questions US Security Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Maintaining United States
national security does not necessarily require interference in the
legitimate trade between European companies and Cuba, European
Union Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan said today.
</P>
<P>
Brittan made the remarks in a statement which aims to give the
U.S. more timed to reach an agreed settlement with the European
Union (EU) on the disputed Helms-Burton and D'Amato Acts before
the World Trade Organization (WTO) forms a panel to resolve the
issue.
</P>
<P>
"Any resort to arguments of national security in a WTO dispute
settlement procedure must clearly be related to genuine national
security concerns," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that it was impossible for a country to evade the WTO
settlement procedure simply by proclaiming that its national
security was involved.
</P>
<P>
He said no country would be allowed to be judge or jury "in its
own cause" to damage the WTO dispute settlement procedure.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said the essence of an independent dispute settlement
mechanism was that no country could expect to win every
case. Instead, all countries accepted that the gains in having
such a system far outweighed the risks of losing particular cases.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Serious Faction Fighting Erupts in North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 12 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were
killed and 12 others wounded in a heavy fighting this
morning in North Mogadishu, Somalia, according to eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, which erupted in Shebbis District between forces
loyal to the Islamic leader, Sheikh Ali Sheikh Mohamud, and those
supporting the rival North Mogadishu faction leader, Ali Mahdi
Mohamed, was the most serious armed clash in North Mogadishu
since last October.
</P>
<P>
Local people said the rival militiamen used technical
vehicles, anti-tank guns, mortar rounds and heavy machine guns
during the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Although the spokesman for Sheikh Ali denied that the fighting
took place between Sheikh Ali's forces and the men loyal to Ali
Mahdi, he characterized the fight as a war between the Islamic
militiamen and what he called gunmen against the pacification of
North Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
So far there is no word yet from Ali Mahdi's side on the
fighting. However, the roads leading to the main Islamic court
have been cut off.
</P>
<P>
The North Mogadishu people had been enjoying peace since the
Islamic courts were established in the region two years ago.
</P>
<P>
But the security in North Mogadishu has deteriorated in
October last year when Ali Mahdi issued a decree which removed
Sheikh Ali from his chairmanship of the High Islamic court.
Sheikh Ali denounced the decree.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Mogadishu controlled by Ali Mahdi's main
rival, Hussein Mohamed Aidid, has remained calm.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Guiseppe Cassini, a special envoy from
the Italian government, met on Tuesday with Ali Mahdi in a bid to
bring the North Mogadishu faction leader to peace talks with
Hussein Aidid, the South Mogadishu warlord.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said a face-to-face negotiation, which would
soon be brought about in the neighboring Kenyan capital of
Nairobi, could start a new round of peace initiative in Somalia
which has been torn apart by six years of civil war.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Rejects German Intervention in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani today rejected German intervention in the arrest of the
chief editor of an Iranian magazine, who sought political asylum
in Sweden and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani told a press conference here today that Faraj
Sarkohi's case is a domestic issue by a hundred percent and
"Germany should not interfere in it."
</P>
<P>
On Iran's stand vis-a-vis German government's reaction to the
case of Sarkohi, he noted, "From our point of view this is
ambiguous and a cause of surprise."
</P>
<P>
"Sarkohi had been in Germany and the Germans declined to
tell everything, thus the case has turned to a hue and cry
and a puzzle," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said "What is important is the reason behind the issue
and other things are not of parallel importance."
</P>
<P>
Iranian security authorities said that the chief editor of the
Persian weekly Adineh was arrested along with his brother and two
other smugglers while attempting to make an illegal exit in
Bushehr, a port city in southern Iran last week.
</P>
<P>
Ismaiel Sarkohi, the brother of the Iranian writer, said last
week that Faraj Sarkohi is mentally unstable.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, spokesman of Iran's Foreign Ministry, has
said that the case of Faraj Sarkohi was unrelated to relations
between Iran and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Since Sarkohi's arrest last week, Sweden and Germany have been
trying to find out what has happened to the Iranian journalist who
has disappeared twice in three months.
</P>
<P>
On November 3, 1996 Sarkohi disappeared after he entered
Tehran International airport. The authorities in Tehran maintained
that Sarkohi had boarded a plane to Germany. On December 20,
Sarkohi reappeared, saying that he had been in Germany, trying to
resolve a family dispute with his wife who resides in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Swedish Foreign Minister Pierre Schori in
Stockholm called on the Iranian government to clarify what has
happened to Sarkohi.

<HEADLINE> Outward Processing in China's inland Contributes to HK Trade Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Outward processing trade
accounted for half of Hong Kong's total exports to China's
interior areas in the third quarter of 1996, as shown by the
latest government statistics.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, outward processing trade made up for 75
percent of Hong Kong's domestic exports and nearly 50 percent of
its re-exports, according to the Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
Outward processing is a popular form of trade between Hong Kong
and booming towns in Southern China. Hong Kong first exports raw
materials or semi-manufactures to interior areas for processing,
and then imports the processed goods.
</P>
<P>
During the third quarter of 1996, Hong Kong exported more than
62 billion HK dollars (about eight billion US dollars) worth of
raw materials or semi-manufactures to interior areas for outward
processing, representing an increase of 11 percent over the same
period of 1995. The domestic exports to China's inland areas for
outward processing fell by six percent to some 11.5 billion HK
dollars (1.5 billion US dollars), while re-exports to the areas
for outward processing jumped by 15 percent to almost 50.6 billion
HK dollars (6.5 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, about 80 percent of Hong Kong's imports from
China's interior areas in the July-September period were related
to outward processing. During the period, the value of imports in
this category hit 336 billion HK dollars (43 billion US dollars),
up 13 percent over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Out of Hong Kong's re-exports of China-made goods to other
countries, 86 percent were produced through outward processing in
the third quarter of 1996. The total value amounted to 410 billion
HK dollars (52.5 billion US dollars), up 14 percent from the same
quarter of 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Leading officials in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have braved winds and
snowstorms to visit farmers and herdsmen in snowstorm-hit areas
during the Spring Festival period.
</P>
<P>
Wang Lequan, secretary of the autonomous regional committee of
the Communist Part of China (CPC), and other ranking officials
drove over 1,000 miles to Altay Prefecture, a seriously affected
area, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the house of Murat Hadi, a herdsman living in the
snow-covered Gobi Desert, Wang asked Murat whether he could find
enough grass to feed his sheep.
</P>
<P>
Murat replied that he had used 7.5 tons of fodder so far but
what he had left may not cope with the need.
</P>
<P>
Wang told Murat he would discuss the matter with relevant
officials after he returned to the county seat and try to
get for him adequate fodder and daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
Then the regional party secretary gave two bags of brick tea,
sugar and some cotton-padded clothes to the household and wished
all the family members a happy New Year.
</P>
<P>
Murat, moved to tears, expressed his gratitude to the Communist
Party of China and the People's Government.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, Wang and his party kept busy visiting a
number of families of ethnic Kazakh minority that is in need and
organizing local officials to fight the snowstorm disasters in the
past three days.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The outgoing Spring
Festival, which fell on February 7 this year, has brought brisk
sales for large department stores in Hong Kong thanks to growing
consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
Jusco Store (Hong Kong) Co. Limited, one of the largest
department stores in Hong Kong, today reported a double-digit
sales growth for the two weeks before the Lunar News Year's Day,
compared with the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Jusco, a merchandise company funded by Japanese capital, saw
its four stores in Hong Kong record the highest sales on the New
Year's Eve. Fashion items and gifts were hot cakes during the
festive season, all posting a 30-percent rise in sales.
</P>
<P>
Yamaguchi, managing director of Jusco were optimistic about
Hong Kong's retail business in 1997 though not all retailers would
be able to capitalize on the recovery of consumer market.
</P>
<P>
In his view, consumers' desire to consume has restored in
anticipation of the smooth transition in mid 1997. The active
stock and property market and booming tourist industry helped to
build up people's confidence.
</P>
<P>
But some retailers would still face rising operation costs,
said Yamaguchi, who believed that value-for-money goods and
cost-effective measures were the key to success.

<P>
LAGOS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's first Export
Processing Zone in Calabar in Cross River State in the southeast,
will be inaugurated in June, the official daily "New Nigerian"
report today.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Minister of Finance Anthony Ani was quoted as saying
on a recent visit to Calabar that the government has released
about 7.5 million U.S. Dollars to complete all the facilities at
the zone.
</P>
<P>
In order to boost import and export at the zone, the
government also planned to expand the runway of the Calabar
Airport so that larger planes such as Boeing 747 could land and
take off.
</P>
<P>
The minister refuted reports that the establishing of another
export processing zone in Port Harcourt in southern Rivers
State would adversely affect the operations of the Calabar zone.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two zones will complement each other as
Calabar will concentrate on manufacture and Port Harcourt on the
oil and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Administrator of Cross Rivers State, Colonel
Umaru Ahmed, has expressed disappointment over the lukewarm
attitudes of local manufacturers to the Calabar Export Processing
Zone, urging them to invest more in the zone.

GENEVA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian gas exports are
expected to almost double, from 197 billion cubic meters (bcm) in
1996 to 360 bcm in 2015, says a press release today by the United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE).
</P>
<P>
The release was issued when the seventh session of the UN/ECE

"Despite the fall in economic activity in Russia, the gas
sector achieved good results in 1996, and its future now seems
more promising than ever," said the UN/ECE in its press release.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the release said: "To sustain the predicted export
levels, considerable investments are required in the Russian gas
industry." It said there was a lack of financial resources.
</P>
<P>
According to the All-Russia Institute for Gas Problems, the
scientific and research arm of GAZPROM, Russia's biggest gas
corporation, Russia's production will rise to 929 bcm by 2015 from
current production of 600 bcm, an increase of 55 percent.

<HEADLINE> Campaign to be Launched to Stop Military Exercise In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Environment and peace groups
in Australia will campaign to stop the joint US-Australian
military exercise "Tandem Thrust" to be held on the north
Queensland coast.
</P>
<P>
Plans for the operation were highlighted this week when a US
supply ship, USNS Kilauea was reported to have run out of fuel off
Townsville and a case of smoke grenades was lost into the sea.
</P>
<P>
Australian Anti-bases Campaign Coalition's national coordinator
Dennis Doherty said today that he would brief activists and launch
the "Stop Tandem Thrust" campaign in Brisbane tomorrow, according
to a press release available here.
</P>
<P>
He said the exercise, to be held in the Shoalwater Bay training
area near Rockhampton in March would involve 17,000 US and 5,000
Australian troops in one of the biggest peacetime exercises in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Doherty said peace and environment groups were opposed to the
war game because of the threats it poses to the environment and
because of its purpose which is to prepare for intervention in
countries that did not agree with US policies.
</P>
<P>
The threats included oil spills, toxic chemicals from live
ammunition and concerns about a nuclear accident (as a nuclear

<HEADLINE> Spanish Royal Couple to Visit Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Spanish King Juan Carlos and
Queen Sophia is scheduled to pay an official visit to Egypt on
February 17-20, their first in 20 years, to cement bilateral trade
links.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's MENA news agency today quoted Spain's Ambassador to
Egypt Juan Alfonso Ortiz as saying that the king will be
accompanied by a business delegation which groups 55 Spanish
businessmen and investors specializing in oil, contracting,
communications, electricity and power.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish monarch will hold talks with President Hosni
Mubarak next Tuesday on the Mideast peace process and Europe's
role in it as well as the bilateral economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish King will attend an economic symposium on the
expansion of trade exchange and joint investments in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
He will also meet Egyptian businessmen over a luncheon and
speak on economic and trade cooperation between the two countries
and boosting joint projects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Spanish investors and businessmen will have
talks with their counterparts in Egypt on the possibility of
augmenting Egyptian exports to Spain and increasing Spanish
investments and joint projects.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed an agreement on economic and industrial
cooperation in March 1991, agreement on investment protection and
an agreement to avoid dual taxation in November 1992.
</P>
<P>
The volume of two-way trade was at 796 million Egyptian pounds
(about 234 million U.S. dollars) in 1993, then rose to 988.9
million pounds (290.8 million dollars) in 1994 and took another
leap to hit 1.16 billion(341 million dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Egypt exported 533 million pounds(157 million dollars) of
commodities to Spain against 626 million pounds(184 million
dollars) of imports in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The main exports to Spain include oil and textiles, while the
imports are basically tires, spare parts, meat, filters and
telephone wires.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Issue Global Bond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today announced that the Philippine Central Bank will
formally launch 1 billion US dollar Global Bond issue in April.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Monetary Board has chosen Salomon Brothers as
the lead manager for this bond offering with JP Morgan, Citicorp,
Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and ING-Baring as co-leads, a news
release from the Presidential Palace said.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson was quoted as
saying that with the US dollar interest rates at historic low
levels and with the current strong market demand for long-dated
debt securities, the bond issue is expected to be well-received
and priced at advantageous terms for the country.
</P>
<P>
Singson also said the Central Bank Global Bond will be the
first non-investment grade paper to be issued that will carry very
long dated tenors.
</P>
<P>
The bond will have a target maturity of a minimum of 30 years
and possibly, where market demand is determined to be sufficient
just prior to launch, a 100 years maturity.
</P>
<P>
Singson explained that the Central Bank is the only Philippine
public sector entity that can issue such very long-dated tenors as
the country's own issuance is limited by law to a maximum of 25
years.
</P>
<P>
The Global Bond, Singson added, is envisioned to establish a
long-dated benchmark for Philippine borrowers, highlighting the
strong performance of the economy and market acceptance of the
Philippine credit.
</P>
<P>
The proceeds from the bond offering will be used principally to
build up the country's international reserves which is presently
at around 11.4 billion US dollars, he said.

<HEADLINE> More Funds for Three Gorges Resettlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- China will invest 2.8 billion
yuan this year for the resettlement of people who are living in
and near the Three Gorges Dam Project, in central China's Hubei
Province.
</P>
<P>
The funds will mainly be used for relocating people in the
flooded areas when the Yangtze River is dammed in November this
year and for the emergency excavation of cultural relics in the
affected areas.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1.2 million people are expected to move out of areas
affected by the gigantic dam project, believed to be the largest
of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale evacuation began in 1993, after an eight-year
relocation on an experimental basis. The state has earmarked 5.8
billion yuan for the resettlement of evacuees in the past four
years.
</P>
<P>
Calculated on the basis of May 1993 prices, the relocation will
cost 40 billion yuan. But officials in charge of the resettlement
predict that more money will be allocated for the scheme in
future.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Bars Germany Meeting EMU Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Germany could not meet the
standards for the 1999 European Monetary Union (EMU) set by the
Maastricht Treaty because of the record high unemployment rate, a
German economist said today.
</P>
<P>
Klaus-Werner Schatz, vice president of the Kiel International
Economic Research Institute, told the Flensburger Tageblatt
newspaper that the rising unemployment was likely to result in a
60 billion marks deficit this year, higher than the expected 50
billion.
</P>
<P>
Schatz said the deficits could account for 3.4 percent of the
gross domestic product, which meant Germany could not meet the EMU
criteria.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the time for achieving a single currency
system be postponed, so strengthening the reliability of the
monetary union.
</P>
<P>
The number of unemployed in Germany soared to nearly 4.66
million in January, the highest since 1933, official statistics
showed.

<HEADLINE> Ties With Singapore Remarkable, Says British FS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said here today that his country enjoys
"a remarkable relationship" with Singapore, but there remain
opportunities to seize.
</P>
<P>
"In almost every sphere of life, Britain and Singapore work
closely together," Rifkind noted in a speech to the Institute of
Policy Studies here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that business is "the heart of our relationship,"
citing a two-way trade volume of 6.7 billion U.S. dollars for
1995.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind expressed his country's welcome to Singaporean
investment in Britain, which is the fourth largest foreign
investor in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the afternoon, Rifkind met with his Singaporean
counterpart, S. Jayakumar and the two men had "a wide-ranging
discussion on Singapore-U.K. bilateral relations, the forthcoming
ASEAN-EU Ministerial Meeting and ASEM Foreign Ministers Meeting in
Singapore and regional and international developments," according
to a Singaporean Foreign Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The two officials also had "a fruitful discussion on the Action
Agenda on Singapore-U.K. Relations," which will serve as the

The two countries also signed a new agreement for the avoidance
of double taxation to replace an old one signed in 1966.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Home Minister Resigns Over Hanbo Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 12 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Home Minister Kim
Woo-suk, involved in the Hanbo loan scandal, has offered to
resign, a government official said today.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who is being investigated for bribery in connection with
the Hanbo scandal, telephoned Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung this
morning before his summons by the prosecution and offered his
resignation, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official said President Kim Young-sam would accept the
resignation and immediately appoint a successor.
</P>
<P>
He added that kim told the prime minister on the telephone that
he "is sorry for his involvement in the Hanbo loan scandal".
</P>
<P>
Kim Woo-suk, along with the ruling New Korea Party (NKP)
legislator Hwang Byung-tai and the opposition National Congress
for New Politics (NCNP) legislator Kwon Roh-kap, was summoned by
the prosecution today for questioning on suspected involvement in
the Hanbo loan scandal.
</P>
<P>
Kim is suspected of taking bribes from the Hanbo Business Group
in return for financial favors to Hanbo while serving as president
of the Korea Land Development Corporation in 1993, and as
construction and transportation minister in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said Hanbo's Chairman, Chung Tae-soo, had
bribed some politicians with huge amounts of money in order to
finance his project of setting up a steel mill in the country's
South Chungchong Province.
</P>
<P>
Chung Tae-soo, who was arrested by the prosecution on January
31 on charges of fraud and embezzlement, allegedly secured six
billion U.S. dollars for his flagship firm, Hanbo Iron and Steel
Company. The company was declared bankrupt by its creditors on
January 23 after failing to honor billions of U.S. dollars in
notes.
</P>
<P>
President Kim Young-sam today ordered law enforcement
authorities to "strictly and fairly" investigate anyone involved
in the Hanbo loan scandal.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know corruption and irregularities were so serious,"
Kim said, adding that there should be a thorough probe without
allowing any havens.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung said today that he would
take responsibility for the Hanbo loan scandal, hinting that he
might resign when the investigation finished.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Challenge EU Dumping Fines on Cotton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is trying to lift the
crippling dumping fines imposed last year by the European Union
(EU) on all its EU-bound cotton exports, said today's Egyptian
Gazette.
</P>
<P>
According to Abdel Hakim Hagag, head of the Holding Weaving and
Textiles Company, contacts are under way by Egyptian ministers of
foreign affairs, industry and trade, and the enterprise sectors,
to totally lift the penalty on Egypt's most important agricultural
export.
</P>
<P>
The dispute began in early 1996 when the EU received a number
of complaints from European cotton producers that Egypt, India,
Indonesia, Turkey and Pakistan were adopting a dumping policy
through selling their produce at less than the production price.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the Egyptian cotton companies of following a dumping
policy, the EU agencies concerned took samples from three
Egyptian cotton companies and decided to slap fines on them, in
addition to a 13.3 percent fine for six months on all Egyptian
cotton exports to the EU, as of November 21, 1996.
</P>
<P>
After the six months, Egypt can plead against the fines.
However, if the plea is turned down, the fines will be extended
for another five years, said Hagag.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's cotton export to EU countries, which reached 155
million Egyptian pounds (45.6 million U.S. dollars) in 1996,
constitutes 74 percent of its total cotton exports.

<HEADLINE> Iran Opts for No Dialog, Confrontation with US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani said here today that Iran seeks neither dialogue, nor
confrontation with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question at a press conference, Rafsanjani said,
"There can be a third alternative to the dialogue and
confrontation" in Iran's policy to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"That is to be in the state of no war, and no peace as we are
in now," said the 62-year-old president.
</P>
<P>
Tehran and Washington broke diplomatic ties shortly after
Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979, which toppled the pro-U.S. Shah
Pahlavi, and the two countries have been hostile to each other
over almost all issues since then.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has imposed sanctions on Iran and even threatened the
Islamic state with a military strike against 19 targets,
including the alleged training camps for extremists and nuclear
reactors in the country.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said "I don't see any new threats against the
country from the United States and we would continue to pursue our
previous policy toward the United States."
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "Unofficially there are statements against
Iran via some media... to the friends of Iran and subsequent
threats of revenge."
</P>
<P>
But, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warned of the possible
danger and said late last month that Iran is ready to confront any
potential U.S. military strike against the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani criticized the U.S. for lack of goodwill in
relations with Iran, adding "If it begins to show goodwill it
would see a different face from Iran."
</P>
<P>
"One of the ways of showing their goodwill is to free Iranian
assets frozen by the United States. If they do that we would
interpret the gesture as a change of policy," he added.

<HEADLINE> Further Cooperation in Macao is Best Souvenir: Chinese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Further cooperation on the
question of Macao between China and Portugal is the best souvenir
to mark the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Portuguese
Joint Declaration, a top Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
made these remarks while addressing a gathering here marking the
Chinese Lunar New Year, which was attended by more than 1,000
Macao celebrities and officials of the Macao government.
</P>
<P>
"On the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Portuguese
Joint Declaration this year, the best souvenir would be
maintaining the good cooperation between China and Portugal so
that Macao's economy would keep growing, society remain in good
order and transitional affairs be completed in time," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
The director said that the three big issues of the transitional
affairs concerning civil servants, language and law have all
scored new progress, but further efforts still need to be made.
</P>
<P>
He urged all residents of Macao to take a more active part in
the transitional affairs, in Macao's economic growth and social
stability. He also urged the Macao government to take further
effective measures, pledging that the Chinese side would offer
whatever help it can.
</P>
<P>
China and Portugal have maintained good relations over the past
few years. Exchange of visits between state leaders has been
frequent. China's Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
visited Portugal last month, and Portuguese President Jorge
Sampaio is to visit China this month.
</P>
<P>
"All questions concerning Macao's transition will be able to be
handled properly if both China and Portugal take into
consideration the general interests of a long-term friendship
between the two sides, and the overall and long-term interests of
Macao," Wang stressed.
</P>
<P>
Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira said in his speech that
multiple cooperation between the two sides has become an important
factor in promoting the process of Macao transitional affairs,
and that the Macao government is fully aware of that.
</P>
<P>
"The Government will do its best to promote the friendly
relationship between Portugal and China," he said, adding that the
Portuguese president's upcoming visit to China would further
enhance the existing relations of understanding.

MACAO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Criminal gangs in Macao burnt a
total of 30 motor vehicles early Tuesday morning, and police
established a special team to investigate the case, according to

<HEADLINE> Macao Joins Five International Tourism Bodies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Macao has joined five
international tourism organizations, which would help Macao
cultivate its tourism and promote its fame across the world, a
local tourism official said.
</P>
<P>
The five bodies are the Asia-Pacific Tourism Association
(PATA), the World Tourism Organization (WTO), the East Asia
Tourism Association (EATA), the Asia Association of Convention and
Visitor Bureaux (AACVB) and the International Congress and
Conference Association (ICCA).
</P>
<P>
Joao Manuel Antunes, director of the Macao Tourism Department,
said on Tuesday that by joining those world bodies, Macao can get
a better publicity at a least expense.
</P>
<P>
"Each time Macao hosts an international conference
successfully, Macao improves its ability of organization," said
Antunes. "That also means a better chance of publicity and more
visitors' arrivals."
</P>
<P>
The Macao Tourism Department first joined the PATA in 1957, and

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Optimism About Business Situation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Most industrialists are
optimistic about the general business situation for the next six
months ending June 1997, according to a survey of Business
Expectations of the Manufacturing Sector by the government's
Economic Development Board (EDB), which was released today.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the number of manufacturing
establishments that expect a positive business situation for the
next six months outweigh those that are pessimistic by 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
The more optimistic industries are the electronics, chemical
products, transport equipment industries and cement/ready-mixed
concrete, the EDB said in releasing the survey.
</P>
<P>
It said that in the electronics industry, business optimism is
mainly led by the computer related industries, particularly the
disk drive sub-segment which anticipates strong demand overseas.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunication equipment sub-segment also foresees good
business prospects ahead in the Asia Pacific market. The consumer
electronics, on the other hand, continues to expect a less
favorable business outlook due to sluggish demand, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Survey of Business Expectations of the Manufacturing Sector
for the first quarter of 1997 was conducted by the EDB between
December 1996 and January 1997. Of a total 383 companies surveyed,
94 percent responded.
</P>
<P>
In conducting the survey, companies were asked to indicate
their experience and the expectations of business conditions,
investment and other indicators such as output, employment, orders
and sales, the EDB said.
</P>
<P>
The companies surveyed expect continued growth in export
orders, output and overseas deliveries in the first quarter of
1997, while on investment plans for 1997, a weighted 73 percent of
the manufacturing establishments plan to invest in plants and
machinery, it said.

<P>
LAGOS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Bechtel International, a U.S.
multinational company has pulled out of an eight-year-old joint
venture pact with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,
"The Guardian" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said it is still unknown why Bechtel decided to
withdraw from the joint venture, National Engineering and
Technical Company Limited (NETCO), two years before the contract
expires.
</P>
<P>
Bechtel's withdrawal, however, will put at risk no fewer than
15 multi-million-dollar contracts in the hands of NETCO, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
These contracts including engineering services for the
3.8-billion-dollar liquid natural gas project on the Bonny Island
in the Rivers State, NNPC Pipeline Phase three, turn around
maintenance of major Nigerian refineries and others.
</P>
<P>
The Bechtel-NNPC joint venture was launched in 1989 to engage
in engineering services in petroleum and allied industries, with
NNPC holding 60 percent of the shares and Bechtel 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
NNPC officials are now in London to discuss with Bechtel on
the purchase of the latter's equities, the report said.

JOHANNESBURG, February 12 (Xinhu) -- South African police
authorities today denied an allegation that its members have been
arrested in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
The South African Police Service is not aware that any of its
member was in detention in Lesotho, South African police
spokeswoman Leah Shibambo said.
</P>
<P>
Shibambo made the remarks apparently in response to news
reports that 14 people were arrested in Lesotho yesterday on
suspicion of being members of a special South African police
unit.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports from Maseru, the capital of Lesotho said a
crack South African police unit was on standby to restore order
in the mountain kingdom after reports of a possible clash between
opposing factions in the Lesotho police force.
</P>
<P>
However, Pretoria government officials have categorically
denied the reports, saying South Africa's support for the Lesotho
government would be executed through diplomatic channels rather
than military means.
</P>
<P>
Mutinous junior officers of Lesotho's Police Training College

<HEADLINE> Iranian Foundation Raises Reward for Killing Rushdie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A private Iranian foundation
has raised its reward for killing British author Salman Rushdie
from 2 million U.S. dollars to 2.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, President Hashemi Rafsanjani declared in a press
conference held here today that the reward has nothing to do
with the government, claiming, "The government policy still
remains the same."
</P>
<P>
The Persian Daily Jumhuri Islami reported today that Ayatollah
Sheikh Jassan Sanai'e, representative of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei and head of the Khordad Foundation, has announced the
decision for raising the reward.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the clergyman made the announcement on
the occasion of the 8th anniversary of the issuance of the decree
on the Indian-born author of the book of "Satanic Verses."
</P>
<P>
Muslim fundamentalists, who consider the book blasphemous for
its irreverent treatment of the Prophet Mohammed, Islam's
founder, reacted very strongly after the book was published in
1989.
</P>
<P>
Sanai'e said that the interests on the reward money would also
be paid to the executor of the decree right from the beginning,
adding, "There is nothing more (important) to the foundation than
seeing Imam Khomeini's decree executed."
</P>
<P>
On February 14, 1989, the late Iranian leader Ayatollah
Khomeini issued a religious edict, announcing the death sentence
of Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest at the
publication of his novel, and exhorting all Muslims to carry out
the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Rushdie issue has turned into a big
controversial problem that hinders the relations between Iran and
European countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran, given tremendous pressures from the European
Union (EU) after the death of Khomeini, has promised not to
dispatch any commandos to kill Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities reportedly face tremendous pressure and
opposition from the religious extremists inside the country on
the issue.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea to Exploit Volcano's Geothermal Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Geothermal energy from
beneath dormant volcanos may help to power Eritrea's economic
growth and cut its expensive oil imports, a report reaching here
said today.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Baire, a senior official in Eritrea's Ministry of
Mines, Energy and Water Resources, was quoted as saying that
geological survey has shown geothermal potential around volcanic
mount Alid, 80 kilometers south of Red Sea port city Massawa.
</P>
<P>
"As a source of energy, if it becomes viable, there is an
option to produce power in that area... In the long run it could
save costs even though the initial investment is very high," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Baire's ministry has recently received a final report by
Eritrean and American geologists who say there are good prospects
for harnessing geothermal energy from Mount Alid.
</P>
<P>
Mount Alid lies on the geologically active Rift Valley which
arcs from northeast to southern Africa. There geothermal energy
can be harnessed when underground water is boiled by volcanic
heat into steam and then used to generate electricity.

KUALA LUMPUR, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Foreign
Minister Jamie Gama said today his country plans to open its
embassies in Malaysia and Singapore to step up diplomatic
relations with ASEAN member countries in an effort to collaborate

</P>
<P>
Jamie Gama said efforts to forge closer relations with the

Malaysia's news agency Bernama as saying after visiting Portuguese
historic sites and the Portuguese Settlement in Melaka (Malacca),
about 145 kilometers south from here.
</P>
<P>
Portugal just opened its embassy in the Philippines this year,
the second diplomatic office in the region. It already has its
embassy in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Jamie, who flew in for a short visit on his way to Singapore to
attend the 12th ASEAN-European Union Ministerial Meeting there
Thursday, said Portugal hopes not only to improve economic and
business ties but also to forge closer political and cultural
links with ASEAN members.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that a high level visit to the region either by
Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio or Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres is also being scheduled later this year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warplanes Strike Palestinian Base Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes launched
this morning an air raid at a base of a radical Palestinian group
near Beirut, but no words on casualties were given by security
sources.
</P>
<P>
The attack came less than 24 hours after a series of
Israeli air strikes at suspected guerrilla targets in the
Syrian-controlled Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon, wounding one
Lebanese civilian and three Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that around 10:30 a.m. (8:30 GMT),
Israeli warplanes dived from the clear blue sky and hit the
Naameh hill south of Beirut, where the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command has a camp.
</P>
<P>
The hill was also stricken by Israeli warplanes in Tuesday
afternoon's air raids.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Lebanese government filed a
complaint to a five-nation committee supervising a limited truce
in the border area between Lebanon and Israel, over the Tuesday
successive air raids in eastern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire monitoring committee, comprising representatives
of France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the United States, was set
up according to a cease-fire understanding reached between Lebanon
and the Jewish state in April, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Radio Lebanon announced this morning that Lebanon
lodged a complaint to the committee's chairman, French diplomat
Jean-Michel Gaussot, over the "wounding of civilians and
destruction of houses."
</P>
<P>
In the complaint, Lebanon accused Israel of violating the
"April understanding," the official radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Brokered by the U.S. and France, the understanding, which put
an end to a 17-day Israeli blitz against Lebanon last April,
barres fighting sides on the last active battlefront of the
Arab-Israeli conflict from targeting civilians.
</P>
<P>
In the first of four sets of air raids in the afternoon, four
Israeli jet fighters pounded a radio station of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, on the outskirts of the
Shiite Muslim stronghold of Baalbek city 90 kilometers east of
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of the Oppressed radio station was badly damaged,
and a 15-year-old shepherd was injured by a number of shrapnels.
</P>
<P>
In another air offensive, two Israeli fighter bombers dropped
two 1,000-kilogram bombs on a base of the PFLP-GC led by Ahamed
Jibril, in the Western Beqaa near the Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
Three Palestinians were wounded in the air raid, the
Damascus-based Palestinian group said.
</P>
<P>
PFLP-GC is among a handful of Palestinian organizations which
are strongly opposed to the peace pursuit led by Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's air raids were the most violent operation Israel
launched in Lebanon since this year.
</P>
<P>
In Israel's "Operation Grapes of Wrath" in south Lebanon
last April, some 200 Lebanese people, mainly civilians, were
killed.

DAR ES SALAAM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian institute
(TAFIRI) will launch a new deep water research ship next month
for establishing fish distribution on the Tanzanian side of Lake
Victoria, reports reaching here from Mwanza said today.
</P>
<P>
TAFIRI Director General, professor Phillipo Bwatondi said in

</P>
<P>
Bwatondi indicated that the vessel will be the first of its
kind to be introduced in Tanzania and is equipped with modern
echo sound system.
</P>
<P>
The director general added that the ship would help the
research institute to get correct data on the remaining fish
stock in Lake Victoria, especially at this time when fish
processors are keen to know the facts on Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the findings which would be obtained
by TAFIRI through using the vessel would help the government

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Rebels Fell Trees Randomly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) has became a major dealer in illegal tree felling in
the world to fund its campaign for a separate Tamil state in Sri
Lanka, according to sources from the north.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that during the period of the LTTE's control
in the Northern Jaffna Peninsula, civilians were prohibited to
cut down trees. But now, they have changed this rule for their own
advantage.
</P>
<P>
After they were driven away from the Jaffna Peninsula and
restricted to the jungles by government troops, the rebels are
felling trees on a mass scale at Batticaloa, Kokavil and Mankulam
jungles in the east of the country, and adding large sums of money
to their coffers to finance their rebel campaign.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE is also involved in drugs, arms and human trafficking
among other unlawful activities, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting for a separate Tamil state in the
north and east of the island country since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Welcomes France's Role in Mideast Pease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri said today that his country welcomes the French role in the
Middle East peace process, hoping that this role will be enhanced
after resumption of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Hariri made the remarks in Paris, France, in an interview
Tuesday with the London-based Al-Hayat daily, the release of which
was available here today.
</P>
<P>
The London-based Arabic daily Al-Hayat today quoted the prime
minister as saying in an interview in Paris that "we welcome the
French role and we are hoping that this role will be strengthened
when the negotiations are resumed."
</P>
<P>
Hariri, currently on a visit to France, had a meeting with
French President Jacques Chirac in Paris Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The coordination between us and Syria, between Lebanon and
France and between France and Syria is big," the Lebanese
premier said.
</P>
<P>
Hariri reiterated his country's refusal of an Israeli
proposal on a conditional withdrawal from Lebanon's land, noting
that "talking about an Israeli withdrawal is a tactical move
rather than a move leading to peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu proposed a unilateral
withdrawal urging the Lebanese government to disarm the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, and intergrates Israel's
proxy militia, the South Lebanon Army, into the government troops.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on escalation of tension in south Lebanon,
Hariri said, "I rule out a war (between Israel and its Arab
neighbors) in the region because this is not a realistic thing."
</P>
<P>
"What is necessary is to bring about quickly a start of the
peace negotiations and bring about quickly an Israeli withdrawal
from all the Lebanese and Syrian territories," Hariri pointed
out.

<HEADLINE> Concern Expressed over Proposed Electoral System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian Trade
Union Congress (MTUC) today said if the proposal to raise
deposits for state and parliamentary election candidates is
implemented, it will result in "politics becoming an elitist
preserve".
</P>
<P>
Expressing deep concern over the proposal, MTUC president
Zainal Rampak said in a statement today that Parliament and state
assemblies would be automatically transformed into an "exclusive
millionaires' clubs" all at the expense of the common people.
</P>
<P>
"Needless to say, such a state of affairs will eventually spell
the end of democracy in our country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement as a powerful reaction to Minister in the
Prime Minister's Department Abang Abu Bakar Mustapha's remarks
Tuesday that the Election Commission would undertake a study on
the possibility of increasing the deposits for state and
parliamentary election candidates.
</P>
<P>
Contestants for state assembly and parliament seats in Malaysia
are presently required to pay a deposit of 3,000 ringgit (about
1,200 U.S. dollars) and 5,000 ringgit (about 2,000 dollars)
respectively. The MTUC leader claimed that arbitrarily increasing
the cost of the electoral process substantially would result in
poor, sincere prospective candidates with good public service
records being disqualified at the starting point itself.
</P>
<P>
The process would "in sum, serve as the fertile breeding ground
for large-scale corruption, money politics vote buying and
political horse- trading", he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to include what he termed
"people-oriented institutions" such as trade unions, societies,
associations and consumer groups in the study group before trying
to effect any significant changes to the electoral system "if at
all there is going to be a study to refine or streamline the
national electoral process".

DAR ES SALAAM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
has called upon Tanzanians to join the anti-corruption drive by
exposing corrupt elements in society.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally in Biharamulo on Tuesday, the fourth day of
his week-long tour in Kagera region, northwestern Tanzania, Mkapa
said he has given government officials six months to report to
him on the steps taken to curb corruption.
</P>
<P>
The war against corruption at village and ward level is in the
hands of people, he stressed, citing initiatives he had shown
earlier to replace public servants having a tainted record.
</P>
<P>
"I call upon each good citizen who loves his or her country to
report corrupt elements," he appealed.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa asked farmers in the country to elect competent, diligent
and hard-working people as their leaders and encouraged them to
sue leaders guilty of embezzling their funds.
</P>
<P>
He said many cooperative societies in the country are plunged
in serious operational problems, adding that the recent amendment
to the Cooperatives Act of 1981 would give autonomy right to
cooperatives members.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Household Tend to Buy More Securities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey has shown that
Beijing residents are holding more securities as monetary assets,
though many still keep their money safely deposited in banks, the
Guangming Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Conducted by the Beijing Statistics Bureau among 1,550
households, the survey indicates that every household has an
average of 39,873 yuan, 79.4 percent of which is in bank deposits,
12.1 percent is in securities and 3.4 percent is cash.
</P>
<P>
The surveyors found a rising demand among residents for buying
state treasury bonds, with about 74.4 percent of securities in the
form of treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1996, household monetary assets rose 7.2 times on
the whole, while securities and banking deposits increased 8.8
times and 7.3 times respectively, but cash in hand rose only 1.3
times.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government, NDF Rebels to Step Up Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos was informed here today that the peace panels of the
government and the rebelling National Democratic Front (NDF) have
agreed to step up their peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Howard Dee, chairman of the government panel, told the
president that the two sides have agreed to accelerate
negotiations in the next four months in order to reach a final
peace settlement by June this year.
</P>
<P>
Dee said that both panels will discuss the human rights
agreement in March, economic and social reforms and perhaps,
political and electoral reforms in April, and the "end of
hostilities and disposition of forces" in June.
</P>
<P>
He said the two panels, which held an eight-day meeting in
Utrecht, the Netherlands, earlier this month, have agreed on the
mode of release for NDF consultant Danilo Borjal on or before
February 18.
</P>
<P>
The meeting began and proceeded as an informal meeting for
several days and became formal after the two panels successfully
hammered out a number of important agreements, which will be
subjected for approval by their respective principals, Dee said.
</P>
<P>
The government signed a peace agreement with the mainstream
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) last year, ending a
24-year-old war in the southern Philippines. It is now pursuing
peace talks with the NDF and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, a
splinter group of the MNLF.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A memorandum of understanding
on a feasibility study on Konkola deep mine of Zambia has been
signed here, a public relations official of the zambia
privatization agency (zpa) confirmed here today.
</P>
<P>
under the memorandum of understanding sealed on Tuesday by the
Consortium of Anglo America and the Zambian government, the giant
consortium has awarded an exclusive right to carry out the
feasibility study on Konkola deep mine.
</P>
<P>
After completing the study Anglo America is likely to spend 12
million U.S. Dollars on the mining project.
</P>
<P>
The feasibility study will take about nine months, ZPA chief
Executive Valentine Chitalu said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Ronald Penza who inked the memorandum on
behalf of the Zambian government said signing of the memorandum
of understanding is a major development in the privatization
process of the country's mining conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
The Konkola mine in northern Zambia contains 340 million tons
of ore resources and can sustain mining operations for over 30
years.

<HEADLINE> Moi Condemns Use of Children in Zaire's Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has condemned the conscription of primary school students
into Zaire's rebel army, terming it as an abuse of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Keiyo District of Rift Valley province on Tuesday,
the president said the rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, is using
children as pawns in pursuit of egocentric goals in the name of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Children must always be given a chance to develop in a
peaceful environment so that they can realize their full
potential, the Kenyan leader added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that human life is abused daily in many parts
of Africa as unsuitable democracy was introduced into the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader had reportedly been walking into classrooms
to conscript students into his army in the last few days in the
face of a counter-offensive by Zairean government troops.
</P>
<P>
Kabila presided over a parade of more than 1,000 new rebel
recruits on Monday at the Roman Catholic secondary school in
Bukavu, appealing to parents in eastern Zaire to encourage their
sons to join his rebel army.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that he commands an army of up tou 15,000
rebels, most of whom are children of around the age of 15 years.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 12 (Xinhua) - The National Committee for
Overseas Vietnamese (NCOV) has put its monthly journal Que Huong
online as the first electric newspaper in the country.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported today that the electric newspaper was
launched on the Internet on February 6, the eve of the lunar new
year.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese-language newspaper provides overseas Vietnamese
with latest information on government policies and the daily life
of the Vietnamese at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The printed journal came out three years ago with low
circulations. NCOV deputy chairman Pham Khac Lam was quoted as
saying that he hoped that the journal will be able to reach about
50,000 Vietnamese readers abroad via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The first issue of the electric newspaper includes new year
greetings from Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh and Foreign
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam's speech at a new year's meeting with
overseas vietnamese returning for lunar new year's holiday. It
also includes Vietnam's socio-economic achievements in 1996 and

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Most Murderous Country: De Klerk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has become
the most murderous country in the world under the governance of
the African National Congress (ANC), National Party (NP) leader
F. W. De Klerk said.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk made the remarks for the first time on Tuesday under
his new title of Leader of the official opposition since NP's
withdrawal from the ANC-led Government of National Unity in May
last year, a local daily "The Citizen" today reported.
</P>
<P>
During the debate on President Nelson Mandela's speech opening
Parliament in Cape Town, De Klerk said the promises and threats
regarding rampant crime made by Mandela needed to be translated
into assertive action and deeds.
</P>
<P>
During the period Mandela delivered his speech to the new
session of parliament last Friday, said De Klerk, six women had
been raped in South Africa, 40 people assaulted, nine motor
vehicles hijacked and three murders committed.
</P>
<P>
While referring to the reconciliation, the opposition leader
also accused the ANC of plunging the country into a form of new
apartheid by fomenting color prejudices, citing the policy of the
affirmative action, which the blacks were reportedly favored than
the whites in the public services and parastatals.
</P>
<P>
"This is a dead-end street which could only end in crisis and
misery," De Klerk claimed.

SHENZHEN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A premature baby girl born
after a gestation period of only 192 days and weighing just 950
grams at birth is in stable condition in a Shenzhen hospital.
</P>
<P>
Experts claim it is the first such case in the city, located in

1,500 grams do not have life-sustaining heart, liver and kidney

The child's mother did not expect her to survive, but 70 days
after the infant was brought to the local maternity and child care
hospital, she was taken off a respirator and can breathe on her
own and drink milk. She now weighs 1,500 grams.
</P>
<P>
Experts say her low weight is no longer
life-threatening. Before this, the hospital had treated several
babies weighing between 1,000 and 1,500 grams.

<HEADLINE> Israel Releases 30 Palestinian Women Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel released overnight
30 Palestinian women prisoners in a positive gesture that will
help push forward to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Thirty of the 31 prisoners slated for release left prisons by
11:30 (21:30 GMT) Tuesday night. Only Zinav Sido, convicted of
selling drugs in 1994, remained at Neveh Tirza Prison.
</P>
<P>
The release was agreed upon at a meeting between Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The release was held up for almost a day as Israel's High Court
of Justice rejected a last-minute petition against the
government's decision to pardon the prisoners, which was filed by
the rightist Association of Terror Victims (ATV). A day earlier,
the court rejected a similar petition by the ATV.
</P>
<P>
All the women were reportedly freed on condition that they
signed a statement pledging not to return to violent attacks
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lamya Maarouf, a 32-year-old Brazilian citizen, was the first
to be released Tuesday afternoon. She was sentenced to 25 years
in jail in 1986 after being convicted of kidnaping and killing
an Israeli soldier. Palestinian officials said she would be
deported after the release.
</P>
<P>
Most of the released women were taken to the Palestinian city
of Ramallah, where several hundreds of people, mostly the
relatives of the prisoners, gathered before the police
headquarters to welcome them home.
</P>
<P>
Despite of presence of Arafat in the welcoming ceremony, the
celebration was very low-key in order to avoid provoking the
extremist Jews.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Israeli police detained two rightist
Jews who tried to block the buses transporting the Palestinian
detainees from leaving a prison.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Arafat praised the release of
Palestinian women prisoners as a good sign for peace with
Israel. "No doubt this will help the relationship between the two
peoples," he said.
</P>
<P>
All the women prisoners were to have been released immediately
after the signing of the Oslo II accords in September 1995, but
Israeli President Ezer Weizman refused to pardon two of them, who
were convicted of killing Jews.
</P>
<P>
In a goodwill gesture after his meeting with Arafat in the wake
of the September bloodshed, due to Israel's opening of a tunnel
near the holy site Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, Weizman changed
his mind by agreeing to pardon also the two murderers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu demanded
Tuesday the PNA to fulfill its own obligations to the peace
accords after Israel's release of the women prisoners.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a tactic, we are serious about fulfilling
commitments, but we intend fully to see that there is an equal
reciprocity on the other sides," he said during a tour to the
northern border.
</P>
<P>
He specifically urged the PNA to stop all political activities
in eastern Jerusalem according to the Oslo accords.

<HEADLINE> China in Urgent Need of Qualified Public Accountants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province has become the tenth province to unite its two
associations of auditors and accountants -- a move regarded as a
milestone in the nationwide reform of the accounting workforce.
</P>
<P>
China started to bring together its organizations for auditors
and accountants in 1995, in a move to better discipline the
accounting field and sever the ties the accounting agencies once
had with the government.
</P>
<P>
"This process will sharpen the competitive edge of Chinese
accountants, helping them edge into the international accounting
market and comply with international accounting norms," observed
Ding Pingzhun, Secretary General of the China Association of
Certified Public Accountants.
</P>
<P>
Ten provinces and autonomous regions have so far completed the
work, bringing the number of members of the Association of
Certified Public Accountants to well over 70,000.
</P>
<P>
That figure will exceed 110,000 when the reform is completed.
</P>
<P>
But China needs even more accountants than that: a team of
300,000 certified public accountants is predicted to be a
necessity by the end of this century, with the rapidly increasing
number of overseas-funded ventures in China.
</P>
<P>
China has also vowed to adopt a unified code to audit the
accounting sheets of large- and medium-sized state firms before
the end of 1997. The code will apply to all Chinese enterprises by
the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Thai Minister Urges Dealers to Deliver Cars on Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Thai Commerce Minister
Narongchai Akrasanee has warned that car makers and dealers must
deliver ordered vehicles to customers on time or face penalties.
</P>
<P>
Narongchai reminded car makers and dealers that under existing
regulations vehicles must be supplied within three months of
booking and that they must pay interest to customers who had made
down payments, or refund the deposit.
</P>
<P>
His warning Tuesday followed heavy bookings for Toyota's new
Soluna, a budget-priced sedan.
</P>
<P>
Customers are worried that the existing assembly capacity of
Toyota Motor (Thailand) Co. might not be able to deliver the
ordered cars on time.
</P>
<P>
The company has collected booking fees totaling 145 million
baht (5.8 million U.S. dollars) based on 29,000 orders for the
Soluna, with each customer paying a deposit of 5,000 baht (200
dollars).
</P>
<P>
It is worried that based on the company's existing production
capacity, customers may have to wait six months for their ordered
cars.
</P>
<P>
The company said it would boost assembly capacity next month in
Thailand from 3,000 to 5,000 per month to ensure punctual
deliveries.
</P>
<P>
An Internal Trade Department source said Toyota aimed to sell
40,000 Solunas this year.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Denies Involvement in War in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has denied any
involvement in the war now under way in Zaire, ''The New Vision''
paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Kadaga, the State Minister for Foreign Affairs, said
in a statement on Tuesday evening that Uganda has no territorial
ambition and has no intention to send troops into its west
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
A Zairean defense spokesman claimed earlier Tuesday that a
plane with Ugandan troops crashed in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Uganda welcomes international monitors at Uganda-Zaire border
to find the fact, she said.
</P>
<P>
Zaire accuses Uganda of backing its rebels and sending troops
to fight inside eastern Zaire, but Uganda has denied any
involvement.
</P>
<P>
Zairean rebels took up arms to fight the Kinshasa regime last
October and have occupied large tracts of territory in eastern
Zaire, and earlier this month Kinshasa launched a
counter-offensive and intense fighting is going on there.
</P>
<P>
Uganda supports non-violent political solutions to the
existing problems in Zaire, Kadaga noted.
</P>
<P>
Although Uganda is not involved in Zairean affairs, Zaire has
been harboring rebels fighting Uganda for several years, the
state minister counter-charged.
</P>
<P>
''The Uganda government take this opportunity to urge all
governments in the region to respect and adhere to Organization
of Africa Unity charter on human and people rights and other
international conventions relating to the rights of citizenship
and nationality,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Colombia's Civil Servants Strike for Higher Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 600,000
government employees in Colombia went on an indefinite nationwide
strike today in support of their demands for higher pay.
</P>
<P>
The strike, called by the National Federation of State Workers,
the Unitary Workers' Union, the Colombian Workers' Union and the
General Confederation of Democratic Workers, began at midnight
local time.
</P>
<P>
About 600,000 to 650,000 people, nearly 70 percent of the
country's public servants, took part in the strike, union
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Union leaders argued that the 13.5 percent salary hike decreed
earlier by the government was an insult to public servants since
last year's inflation was 21.65 percent. They asked for new
negotiations with the government to further increase their wages.
</P>
<P>
They also opposed the privatization of state-owned companies
and violence against union movements.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, international airlines including American Airlines
and Continental Airlines suspended operations in Colombia, fearing
the strike could spread to other sectors including communications.
</P>
<P>
President Ernesto Samper Pizano said Monday evening on the
national radio network that "murky interests" were behind the
strike to "sow the seeds of chaos and violence".
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Horacio Serpa asked the strikers to behave
with prudence and good judgment to avoid being taken advantage of
by drug traffickers and guerillas.
</P>
<P>
Government authorities said security forces are on alert
throughout the country to prevent any possible disturbances.

<P>
LUSAKA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern

Vewde Demissie as saying that the commitment followed recent
recommendations by the COMESA Trade and Customs Committee to the
Council of Ministers which pledged a schedule of Common External
Tariffs (CET).

This agreement was arrived at after extensive discussions of
various studies regarding the establishment of CET, the global
liberalization after the Uruguay round agreement and the
liberalization trends within COMESA.
</P>
<P>
the agreement on a schedule of CET for COMESA facilitates the
establishment of a single market with a population of 320
million, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 80 billion U.S. Dollars,
and import bill of 19 billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
It provides vast opportunities of national, cross-border and
direct foreign investment and trade.

<P>
The decision to establish CET also took into account the
economic competitiveness of member countries, impact of a common
external tariff on government revenue, protection of domestic
industries, intra-COMESA trade, COMESA trade with third countries
and on consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA Council of Ministers is expected to discuss CET
recommendations in Lusaka on April 7-8 to prepare the agenda for

<HEADLINE> Slovakia Records Trade Deficit in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Slovakia ran a trade deficit of
2.15 billion U.S. dollars in 1996 as against a surplus of 56.7
million dollars recorded in 1995 and 109 million dollars in 1994,
according to the latest report of the National Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The exports in 1996 amounted to 9.02 billion dollars, an
increase of six percent, while the imports totalled 11.17 billion
dollars, a sharp increase of 28.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the deficit mainly to lack of
competitiveness of the country's high value-added goods in the
world market and insufficient channels of exports.
</P>
<P>
About 85 percent of Slovakia's exports have been carried out
through the Czech Republic since the two separated from each other
in January 1993.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Signs 1997 National Budget Into Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos signed here today into law the 1997 national budget totaling
493.1 billion pesos (18.8 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The budget, which was approved after two months' hot debate
between the two chambers of Congress, is 16.5 billion pesos (630
million U.S. dollars) higher than the amount originally proposed
by the president.
</P>
<P>
"The passage of the budget law ensures the continuity of the
strong fiscal foundation we have carefully laid out since I took
office in 1992," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos commended Congress for reflecting in the budget his
proposal that the largest chunk of the budget should continue to
go to social services.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the increase in capital outlays in the budget,
saying it will enable the government to improve its capital stock
and other more-enduring investments that will build up the
country's capability for self-sustaining development.
</P>
<P>
However, Ramos vetoed nine items in the budget, which include
the provision banning the Commission on Elections to appropriate
funds for any elections or plebiscites for the purpose of amending
the Constitution.

<HEADLINE> Israel, U.S. to Launch New Anti-missile Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the United
States plan to launch a new anti-missile program this summer
that aims to destroy enemy ballistic missiles in early stage,
a report said today.
</P>
<P>
The program, called Boost-Phased Intercept (BPI), would begin
with a risk-reduction phase that will ensure a consequently
smoother research and development program, Israeli officials were
quoted by today's The Jerusalem Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that the phase would cost 34 million
U.S. dollars which were to be shared by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the U.S. Congress provided 15 million dollars
for a multi-year feasibility study of BPI. At present, senior
defense officials are quietly making the rounds in Congress to
ensure that the funding will be available for the next
phase, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Boost-Phased-Intercept, a concept that remains unproven, calls
for the destruction of enemy missiles in their early stage of
launch when the projectiles are still low in the sky and moving
slowly. One approach is to use an early-warning airborne radar
system to detect the launches and direct another plane to fire a
laser beam that would destroy the enemy missiles.
</P>
<P>
"We are coming up with all sorts of projects on how to
deal with Scud-type missiles," a senior Israeli defense official
said.
</P>
<P>
The issue of BPI was discussed last month during the
visit to Israel of the new head of the U.S. Ballistic
Missile Defense Organization, U.S. Air Force Lt.- Gen. Lester
Lyles.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials confirmed that Lyles returned from Israel on
January 29 with a draft agreement to build a prototype of
unmanned aerial vehicles designed to intercept enemy missiles.
</P>
<P>
Israeli defense sources maintain that the U.S. government is
showing growing interest in BPI. They also said the main
contractor for the BPI program would be Israel Aircraft
Industries.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Adopts Regulation to Control Drug-Making Chemicals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan
Province, which yearly confiscates large amounts of chemicals that
can be used to make drugs, has enacted a local law to crack down
on the use of special chemicals or pharmaceuticals needed to
produce illegal substances.
</P>
<P>
Adopted recently by the provincial people's congress, the
regulation lists 28 chemical products that can be easily turned
into drugs. They include ephedrine for making the drug "ice," and
acetic anhydride, ether and chloroform for making heroin.
</P>
<P>
The law stipulated that ventures or companies that make, sell,
transport and use the listed chemicals must receive special
licensing. Those units are prohibited from providing any of the
listed chemicals overseas.
</P>
<P>
The regulation added that businesses or individuals that
illegally make, sell or transport the listed chemicals will be
fined between 5,000 to 10,000 yuan (600 to 1,200 U.S. dollars) and
their products and vehicles used to transport the drugs will be
confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Those who smuggle the listed chemicals abroad will be punished
as drug runners in accordance with the state law.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is famous for its rubber trees, and the chemical agents
such as acetic anhydride, ether and chloroform are usually used as
a coagulating agent in the processing of rubber latex.
</P>
<P>
Ephedrine can be used to treat asthma and rhinitis.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: ASEAN, EU to Seek Common Ground  Despite Differences by Liu Huorong, Zeng Hu (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 12 (Xinhua) -- As their foreign ministers
are arriving in the Lion City for a two-day meeting today, the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the European
Union (EU) seem set to give another push to their 20-year-old
relationship of dialogue and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At their two-day meeting beginning Thursday, foreign ministers
from the seven ASEAN and 15 EU countries will "review the ASEAN-EU
dialogue relationship and set future directions for the ASEAN-EU
dialogue," the Foreign Ministry of Singapore, the host, said in a
press statement issued on the eve of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The ASEAN-EU dialogue is important for both strategic and
economic reasons," Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar said in
a recent interview with the press. "We are working hard to ensure
that the 12th ASEAN-EU Ministerial Meeting (AEMM) in Singapore
will give an added impetus to the relationship."
</P>
<P>
The two regional groupings have built up an extensive network
of commercial, economic and political relations since 1977 when
their ties were formalized as the EC became an ASEAN dialogue
partner and was invited to attend the First ASEAN Post-Ministerial
Conference.
</P>
<P>
In the following year, the two organizations decided to open
negotiations for a cooperation agreement, which was signed in 1980
and is still in force today, having been amended to include Brunei
Darussalam in 1985. And according to the program of the coming
12th ASEAN-EU Ministerial Meeting, the accord will be further
amended to include Vietnam.

<TEXT>
<P>
And over the years, the two sides have become each other's
major trading partners. Official figures show that in 1995, EU
exports to the ASEAN reached 52.88 billion U.S. dollars, out of a
total of 1.911 trillion dollars, while exports from the ASEAN to
the EU amounted to 46.63 billion dollars, out of a total of 249.48
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam while the EU has as
its members Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Apart from a review of the ties between the two organizations,
the 12th ASEAN-EU Ministerial Meeting (AEMM) is also expected to
discuss issues such as economic relations, political issues,
development cooperation and other people-to-people activities
before adopting a joint declaration, which a Singapore Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman said "can be expected to put in place a
framework that will guide relations into the next century."
</P>
<P>
But despite the two sides' determination to focus on common
ground during the meeting, difference may erupt, particularly over
issues such as East Timor and Myanmar, which were raised at AEMM
meetings in the past.
</P>
<P>
At the Senior Officials Meeting here which started Tuesday to
prepare for the Ministerial Meeting, EU officials have indicated
that they are going to raise the two issues and want to include
them in the joint declaration to be issued at the end of the
meeting.

<P>
The ASEAN however has made it clear that these two questions
should be excluded.
</P>
<P>
"A fundamental principle of ASEAN member states is that we do
not comment on the internal situation, nor interfere in, the
domestic politics of other countries," Singapore Foreign Minister
Jayakumar said. "With regard to Myanmar, the ASEAN approach of
constructive engagement remains the most useful."
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN, at its informal summit in Indonesia last year,
agreed to admit Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos simultaneously,
hopefully before the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
In regard to the issue of East Timor, which the EU may raise at
the meeting as it did in the past, Jayakumar believed that the
ASEAN-EU Ministerial Meeting is not an appropriate forum.
</P>
<P>
"It is an issue which is between Indonesia and Portugal and
should not be introduced into the ASEAN-EU level relationship," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has already threatened to walk out of the meeting
should the EU or Portugal raise the question, a Singapore Foreign
Ministry official said earlier.
</P>
<P>
The country claims East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, as
part of its territory while Portugal insists that the people there
should be given the right to self-determination.
</P>
<P>
"The Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the European
Union are at a critical point in their relationship," an ASEAN-EU
ad hoc Eminent Persons Group pointed out in a report, which spells

HANOI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's population reached 76
million by the end of 1996, with an annual growth rate of 2.0
percent, official statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics published in today's Vietnamese Daily
Nhan Dan, the average family size reduced from 3.3 children per
family in 1994 to 2.78 in 1996. At the same time, the birth rate
fell to an estimated 2.1 percent in 1996 compared to 2.39 percent

HARARE, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaria killed 128 Zimbabweans
countrywide in the first five weeks of this year, while another
66,556 cases were reported during the same period, a health
official has said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Health and Child Welfare Ministry Paulinus

the outbreak.
</P>

At least 1.3 million U.S. Dollars have been used to buy

favored by mosquitoes, and another 700,000 Dollars were used to
buy anti-malaria drugs, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Sikosana said his ministry anticipated the malaria problem to
be bigger this year than last year because of the incessant and
widespread rains, a situation which created a conducive
environment for mosquito breeding.

Last year, malaria killed more than 2,000 Zimbabwean people.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Selects 7 Hydro Projects for Feasibility Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
selected seven medium-size hydropower projects throughout the
country for feasibility study under a loan assistance program,
electricity planning officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The seven projects, with a total generating capacity of nearly
600 megawatt, are mostly located in hilly areas of western and
eastern Nepal, officials of the Medium Hydropower Study Project
(MHSP) were quoted by local newspapers as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most of these proposed projects have been chosen for
feasibility study after one year of preliminary study under the
MHSP, which is financed by a five million US dollar loan from the
International Development Agency, they said.
</P>
<P>
The MHSP project, implemented by the Nepal Electricity
Authority (NEA), the governing body of the country's power sector,
is part of the government's electricity planning process which
involves completion of technical and environmental studies to
start the project financing.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government earlier has adopted a policy to encourage
private investors to develop hydropower projects, especially small
and medium-size ones, in the country which has an estimated
hydroelectric potential of some 83,000 megawatt.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Air Force Resumes Coastal Training Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force resumed
training flights along parts of the country's coastlines today
after a four-day suspension following accidents involving military
planes and commercial jets.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the Air Force is
redesigning its training to take into account the sensitivity of
collision avoidance systems on civilian planes.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the things investigators discovered was that
many commercial planes' alerts can be triggered off by fighter
jets at distances the military pilots may not be counting on.
</P>
<P>
Two incidents occurred last Wednesday off the East Coast of
Maryland and New Jersey involving commercial aircraft and F-16 Air
National Guard jets that prompted a suspension of training
missions along the coast.
</P>
<P>
In one of the cases, collision alarms sounded in an airliner
when F-16 fighters came too close, causing one airline pilot to
maneuver so sharply that three people were thrown to the floor. In
the other case, the pilot went into a descent to avoid the
military planes.
</P>
<P>
Two more incidents were reported on Friday. One took place when
two F-16s and an American Airlines MD-80 passenger jet came too
close near Clovis, New Mexico. The second incident was between one
F-16 and a Northwest Airlines Airbus about 117 kilometers
southwest of Palacios, Texas.
</P>
<P>
In the New Mexico incident, a collision warning was triggered
aboard an American Airlines MD-80 jetliner and the pilot climbed
to avoid coming close to the military planes.
</P>
<P>
The F-16s were about 5.6 kilometers from the airliner and
flying within 90 meters of the airliner's altitude at the time,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
In the Texas incident, an F-16 came within 7.7 kilometers
horizontally and 90 meters vertically of a Northwest Airbus.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Friday ordered
controllers at its Jacksonville, Florida, Washington and New York
air traffic control centers and military controllers at the
Virginia Capes station to review procedures for handling traffic.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Parties Agree To Support Caretaker Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The five main parties in the
Bulgarian parliament agreed on Tuesday to support a caretaker
cabinet until elections are held in April, the Bulgarian Telegraph
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at a meeting called by President
Petar Stoanov Tuesday afternoon, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the five parties in parliament agreed to give full
powers to the caretaker government which will be appointed by
Stoanov to deal temporarily with the country's economic crisis,
including signing loan and assistance contracts with international
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time this month Bulgaria's politicians have
reached agreement, propelled by escalating protests and the
economic disaster which has engulfed the country.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria plunged into a political crisis after the previous
Socialist prime minister resigned in December over his handling of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Although the Socialist government was only half-way through its
four-year mandate, the opposition and outgoing president protested
against the Socialists forming a new government.
</P>
<P>
Pressure mounted on the Socialists as people took to the
streets in massive daily protests calling for early elections.
</P>
<P>
The parties finally signed an agreement on February 4 on
holding a general election on April 19 this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the parliamentary group led by the ruling
Socialists gave up its chance to form a government.
</P>
<P>
The caretaker government is expected to function for about
three months, the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency said, adding that
Sofia city mayor Stefan Sofianski was likely to be appointed prime
minister of the caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
Sofianski himself did not confirm or rule out the
possibility. But he told reporters Tuesday that the caretaker
government would make all-out efforts to negotiate with the
International Monetary Fund for loans and assistance.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's economy has almost collapsed over the last year as
prices skyrocketed and living standards fell dramatically.
</P>
<P>
The political crisis added fuel to the fire; the currency, the
lev, has fallen five-fold to about 2,500 to the U.S. dollar since
January 1.
</P>
<P>
Monthly inflation was put at 50 percent in January alone and
average monthly wages have plummeted in value to less than 10
dollars compared to 70 dollars a year ago.

NEW DELHI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
decided to allow private participation including foreign
companies, in the exploration and mining of coal, a government
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet decision made on Tuesday will be applicable only
after the government changes the coal/mines (nationalization) act
1957, through an amendment approved by parliament as the act
prohibits the entry of private companies in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The government will also have to amend the mines and minerals
(regulation and development) act 1957 in order to permit private
companies to undertake exploration work.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies would be allowed into the sector only through
joint ventures with the Indian companies subject to the approval
from the foreign investment promotion board (FIPB).
</P>
<P>
The extent of equity participation of the foreign companies
would depend on the FIPB formula fixed by the government from time
to time, the same source said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government currently allows 50 percent foreign
equity in exploration and mining and 74 percent in mining
services.
</P>

The entry of private sector was necessary to bring in advanced
technology, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Russia Warns of Retaliation Against NATO's Expansion Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia would have to take
retaliatory measures if NATO insisted on its plans for eastward
expansion, Secretary of the Russian Security Council Ivan Rybkin
said today.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting Danish Defense Minister Hans
Haekkenup, Rybkin stressed that NATO's expansion would result in
great changes in the political situation within Russia and
seriously threaten the country's democratic reform process.
</P>
<P>
Russia has repeatedly expressed its strong opposition against
NATO's expansion plans since the 16-member alliance officially
announced the plan in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin reiterated that NATO's plan had not been anticipated by
Russian leaders, who believed the alliance would disintegrate
after the Warsaw Pact bloc was disbanded in the wake of the
collapse of the Soviet Union in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The Warsaw Pact bloc was NATO's arch rival in the Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin indicated that cooperation between Russia and NATO was
possible if the latter agreed to sign an independent agreement
with Russia.
</P>
<P>
He added that Europe's security should be guaranteed by the
joint efforts of all countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin's remark coincided with a current tour by NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana of the four former Soviet republics of
Moldova, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Another report from the Interfax news agency quoted Dmitry
Ryurikov, Russian President Boris Yeltsin's top foreign policy
adviser, as saying that Solana's tour was aimed at showing NATO's
tough line on the expansion issue.
</P>
<P>
Ryurikov said Solana's tour was also a signal to the four
nations that NATO's door was open to them.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange opened higher this morning, the first
trading day of the year of the Ox, after a long festive break.
</P>
<P>
At 12.30 hours today, the Composite Index added 15.31 points to
1,257.26, the Emas Index was at 360.82, up 4.62 points and the
Industrial Index was 2,355.01, up 24.21 points.
</P>
<P>

Turnover was 226.348 million units valued at 1.067 billion
ringgit (about 426.8 million U.S. dollars) by the time.
</P>
<P>
The local market was aided by the strong overnight close on
Wall Street, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The firm undertone of the market before it closed for the long
Chinese New Year and Moslem's festival of Fast-breaking holidays
last week, coupled with the firmer ringgit, was also attributable
to the rise in share prices, they said.

<P>
"It was a good start to the week, as far as the share market
was concerned, but this is left to be seen for the rest of the
week, a dealer said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Albania's Ruling Democrats to Discuss Solutions to Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister
Alexander Meksi said today that his administration was trying to
restore peace through dialogue in the southern port of Vlore,
where three people died in rioting this week.
</P>
<P>
Meksi said the government has decided to postpone the
declaration of a state of emergency in the city following clashes
between the police and protesters who lost their life savings in a
string of collapsed pyramid investment schemes.
</P>
<P>
Widespread rioting swept Albania last month after pyramid
schemes offering quick returns started to go bust. The schemes had
attracted money from virtually every family in the country of 3.4
million people over the past six years. Citizens in Vlore suffered
the biggest losses.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has blamed the government for the failure of the
investment schemes and demanded the resignation of the government.
</P>
<P>
President Sali Berisha convened an emergency meeting of the
parliamentary group of the ruling Democratic Party on
Monday. Members of the group debated the situation in Vlore and
the whole country and measures to control the situation.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Plans Tax Refund to Help Promote Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Tourism Authority of
Thailand (TAT) will complete guidelines for tax refund for foreign
tourists in the first half of this year to boost Thailand as a
shopping center in the Southeast Asian region, according to local
press today.
</P>
<P>
In principle, the planned tax refund system drafted by the TAT
will specify a minimum spending limit over which tourists can
claim a tax refund at the airport before leaving Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The initiative is hoped to be a big attraction to lure foreign
tourists to spend more money on shopping, similar to systems
operating in Hong Kong and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The 7 percent value-added tax refund program for foreign
tourists is to be launched this year in preparation for the
revisit Thailand year in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
The TAT hopes it will be a strong selling point for the
country, beyond the well-known traditional Thai culture and
natural locations.
</P>
<P>
Pannara Choochan, deputy governor for marketing at the TAT, was
quoted as saying that the aim of becoming a shopping center will
be achieved in stages, so problems regarding tax refunds, quality
control of products, experience of traders, as well as duty free
shops for tourists can be addressed in stages.
</P>
<P>
The year 1998, he said, will be best opportunity to turn
Thailand into a shopping center. Thailand in that year will host
the Asian Games which will generate many activities throughout the
year. It is expected more tourists will visit Thailand in 1998 --
about one percent increase from an estimated 7.5 million this
year.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Budget Cuts to Reduce Growth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's economic growth
rate for this year is expected to fall to 6.8 percent from an
earlier forecast of 7.1 percent, as a result of massive budget
cuts proposed by the government.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on Tuesday, the cabinet decided to cut 99 billion
baht (3.96 billion US dollars) from the fiscal 1997 budget
standing at 984 billion baht (39.36 billion dollars), to ease the
country's current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
Specific projects to be cut are yet to be decided. But those
deemed to be unproductive, non-urgent or having a high import
content are likely to be axed.
</P>
<P>
Of the proposed cuts, the government spending will be reduced
by 59 billion baht (2.36 billion dollars), while state enterprises
will face a reduction of at least 40 billion baht (1.6 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The pruning is aimed at lowering the current account deficit,
which reached 8.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) last
year.
</P>
<P>
If the planned cuts are implemented, the country's current
account deficit for 1997 would drop to 7.4 percent of GDP, from
8.3 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's fiscal year 1997 ends on September 30 this year.

<HEADLINE> Ecuadoran Congress Names New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's Congress today
selected its leader Fabian Alarcon as the country's interim
president, hours after Acting President Rosalia Arteaga's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon, now 50, got the job by winning a majority of
congressional votes. He will act as an interim president to govern
the country until 1998, when he is supposed to call new elections.
</P>
<P>
The selection of an interim president was in line with an
earlier deal between Acting President Arteaga and Congress amid a
political turmoil in this small Andean nation.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the two sides agreed that Vice President Arteaga
would act as president until legislators name an interim president
to replace ousted President Abdala Bucaram.
</P>
<P>
Arteaga refused to give up her post as caretaker president on
Monday, insisting that Congress would have to amend the country's
constitution before it could elect an interim president.
</P>
<P>
But she changed her mind later and declared she would return to
her vice presidency held in the Bucaram administration.
</P>
<P>
In a letter announcing her resignation, Arteaga proposed a
national referendum to decide what role Congress should play when
the presidency becomes vacant and whether she should retain the
post of vice president.
</P>
<P>
On a previous occasion, Alarcon was sworn in as interim
president by legislators last week immediately after they voted to
oust Bucaram on the grounds of "mental incapacity."
</P>
<P>
But as an elected president, Bucaram refused to step down. And
Arteaga claimed that under the country's constitution, she should
assume the presidency when the post becomes vacant.
</P>
<P>
It was through the military's mediation that the vice president
and Congress worked out an agreement that resulted in Arteaga's
taking of the presidential office for two days.
</P>
<P>
Bucaram, who left here today on a chartered plane for Panama,
said he was still the president. "I never resigned and will never
resigned," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called Congress' action to oust him a dangerous
precedent. "Now Congress can meet and overthrow a president in 10
minutes," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Opposes Canada's Whaling Permit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
responded today to Canada's "unacceptable" decision to authorize
whaling by brushing aside Canadian request for trade in seals.
</P>
<P>
"Canada's unilateral decision to authorize whaling outside of
the IWC (International Whaling Commission) is unacceptable,"
Clinton said in a letter to Congress. "Canada's conduct
jeopardizes the international effort that has allowed whale stocks
to begin to recover from the devastating effects of historic
whaling."
</P>
<P>
Washington's reaction was to Canadian government's alleged
decision last year to issue whaling licenses to native hunters.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government said that the move undermined the
conservation program of the IWC aimed at protecting the endangered
bowhead. Canada is not a member of the IWC.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he had instructed the U.S. Commerce Department to
suspend consideration of any Canadian requests for waivers to the
existing moratorium on the import of seals and seal products into
the United States.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the U.S. State Department to oppose Canadian
efforts to address takings of marine mammals within the newly
formed Arctic Council.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president said he felt these measures were more
appropriate than imposing an import ban on Canadian fish
products.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar National Races Urged to Safeguard Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Senior-General
Than Shwe today urged all the national races in the country to
safeguard the Union and ensure its lasting existence with the
Union spirit.
</P>
<P>
In his message to today's Golden Jubilee Myanmar Union day,
Than Shwe, who is also chairman of the ruling State Law and Order
Restoration Council, called on the national races to oppose and
crush the internal and external "destructive elements" who are
"disturbing" and "disrupting" the stability and progress of the
state.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "at present, neo-colonialists are found to
be blatantly interfering in the internal affairs of other
countries pursuing their policy of hegemony in various parts of
the world."
</P>
<P>
"Traitorous elements with negative views in the country, who
are cohorts of the colonialists, at the same time, are offering
their support to the neo-colonialists, to enable them to meddle in
the internal affairs of our country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that national solidarity has been restored and
different groups of various national races have joined with the
Tatmadaw (Armed Forces) in their endeavors to implement regional
development projects.
</P>
<P>
He also urged all Myanmar national races to take part in
building a peaceful, modern and developed nation, while the
government is striving for the progress in economic and social
life of the people along with peace and tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
Fifty years ago on the very day in 1947 before Myanmar regained
independence from Britain, the then Myanmar leaders led by General
Aung San, national hero, and representatives of all the national
races met in Panglong and signed the Panglong Agreement to strive
for an end to the British colonialists' rule in the country and
formed the Union of Burma (Myanmar). One year later in January
1948, Myanmar regained independence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Union Flag hoisting ceremony was held at the
People's Square here this morning to mark the Golden Jubilee
Myanmar Union Day.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, there were Union Flag relay activities in the
capital.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Prepares Concept Paper on Sub-regional Grouping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
preparing a concept paper on sub-regional cooperation among
Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Bhutan, spelling out the framework
and objectives of the proposed idea, according to the Foreign
Ministry sources.
</P>
<P>
The paper will be placed at a specially convened meeting of
foreign secretaries of the four countries, which is likely to take
place in Kathmandu sometime in March for launching the idea on
more concrete terms, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretaries' meeting is likely to be followed by a
meeting of the foreign ministers of the concerned four countries.
</P>
<P>
The idea of sub-regional cooperation was first floated by
Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad at the SAARC foreign
ministers conference held in New Delhi in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)
also includes Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
The concept paper proposed by Dhaka will aim at identifying the
areas of cooperation between the four neighboring countries. The
paper will also try to explore the possibilities of undertaking
some steps under a common platform to address some identical
problems confronting the four countries.
</P>
<P>
The issues may include the problems of illegal trafficking of
women and children, cross-border trade and smuggling. Some common
concerns like environmental degradation will also be addressed.
</P>
<P>
Although harnessing of water resources is seen as a crucial
area, this may take a back seat at the formative stage of the
sub-regional concept, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Mostar Still Tense After Monday's Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia's divided city of
Mostar remained tense today following Monday's clash between the
Muslims and Croats, in which five people were killed and 46
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Alije Izetbegovic, Chairman of the three-man Presidency of
Bosnia and leader of the Bosnian Muslims, and Kresimir Zubak, a
Croat member of the presidency, urged people in Mostar not to take
any action which could escalate the violence in the city.
</P>
<P>
A night-time curfew was declared in Mostar after Monday's
trouble when Bosnian Croats opened fire on Muslim pilgrims trying
to visit a cemetery in Croat-controlled west Mostar. Two people
were killed and 22 were injured.
</P>
<P>
In revenge, the Muslims attacked Croat vehicles passing
Muslim-controlled east Mostar, leaving two Croats dead, 24 wounded
and 20 vehicles damaged.
</P>
<P>
Croats then evicted some 26 Muslim families out of west Mostar.
</P>
<P>
The multi-national stabilization force Sfor arrived at the
demarcation line to separate the two sides and patrol the streets
in a bid to prevent the conflict from worsening.
</P>
<P>
Both the Muslims and Croats blamed each other for starting the
conflict. Representatives of the international community in Bosnia
are investigating the incident.

<HEADLINE> 200 Private Museums Operating in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- China plans to add to its more
than 200 private museums by opening to the public collections of
Mao Zedong badges, miniature carvings, tree-root engravings,
first-issue journals, tickets, insects, stones, ship models and
unusual bottles.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the wide variety illustrates the shift in
philosophy of Chinese private collectors, who have long refused to
put their antiques on public display.
</P>
<P>
To date, Shanghai has 20 private museums and Beijing has 10,
including four which will open soon.
</P>
<P>
The "Calculator Museum," China's first individually-sponsored
museum, was opened by Chen Baoding in Shanghai in March of
1981. On show are over 520 Chinese and foreign calculators,
including one abacus that is four meters long and another that is
round and silver.
</P>
<P>
The wave of private collections began in the early 1980s with
the country's reform drive and improved lifestyles. Now the number
of such museums accounts for 16 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
China's first museum opened in 1905, and since then, more than
2,000 state and collectively-run museums have received visitors.

<HEADLINE> Guatemalan Congress Approves Deployment of UN Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Guatemalan congress
today unanimously approved the deployment of 155 United Nations
military observers to verify compliance of a recent peace accord
which ended 36 years of civil war in the country.
</P>
<P>
The main task of the U.N. mission will be to verify the
demobilization and disarmament of some 3,000 guerrillas from the
Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit (URNG) who waged a 36-year
war against the government for recognition of economic, social and
land rights for the indigenous population.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of observers comes under the terms of a
definitive cease-fire agreement signed by the government and the
URNG in the Norwegian capital Oslo on December 4, 1996, as part of
negotiations for a final peace treaty which was signed on
December 29.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council approved the mission on January
20. The observers will be sent to eight zones in the Guatemalan
interior designated as assembly points where the guerrillas are to
surrender their weapons before starting their integration into
civil life.

<P>
QUITO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's Acting President
Rosalia Arteaga announced her resignation tonight, two days after
she took the office following the ouster of an elected president.
</P>
<P>
Arteaga made her intention public at a press conference while
the country's top legislators, who sacked President Abdala Bucaram
last week, were debating a new replacement to run the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Arteaga was the small Andean nation's vice president until
Congress named her acting president on Sunday to replace Bucaram,
who was voted out by the legislature for "mental incapacity."
</P>
<P>
Before stepping down, Arteaga issued a decree calling for a
national referendum on whether a vice president should succeed the
president if the head of state's position becomes vacant.
</P>
<P>
But as a caretaker president, Arteaga was committed to an
agreement with Congress that she would give way to an interim
president who would call new elections and govern until 1998.
</P>
<P>
She reportedly refused to give up power on Monday but later
changed her mind.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Rejects NATO Expansion Plan: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) still lacks justification for its planned
eastward expansion, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said
today.
</P>
<P>
As Russia's closest ally within the Commonwealth of Independent
States, Belarus has firmly sided with Russia in opposing NATO's
plans for expanding into eastern Europe since the 16-nation
alliance officially announced its plan in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said Belarus would not question the right of other
countries to join NATO, but hoped that its own stance would be
taken into consideration when the alliance discussed the plans.
</P>
<P>
And he warned there would be a high price to pay if Belarus'
views were ignored.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko pointed out that safeguarding the security of
European countries will be realized by demilitarization in the
region instead of an enlarged military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko made the remarks in a foreign polcy speech at a
government meeting, during which he also mentioned Belarus'
policies on China and Russia, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The president indicated that China and Belarus are political
partners and his country would always treasure such a
relationship.
</P>
<P>
He added that great potential still exists for the two
countries to expand economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
But he said Russia-Belarus relations were his foreign policy's
top priority. Belarus will consistently develop friendship with
Russia so as to benefit the peoples of the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Argentina, Paraguay and
Uruguay today inaugurated a waterway project which will link the
three countries, increasing freight transport and cutting costs.
</P>
<P>
Argentine President Carlos Menem, Paraguayan President Juan
Wasmosy and Uruguayan President Julio Sanguinetti took part in the
ceremony, which opened work on a 3,440-kilometer waterway
connecting the three neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The project includes dredging a 32-foot deep canal from the
port of San Martin in the Argentine province of Santa Fe to the
Atlantic Ocean, through the Emilio Mitre Canal.
</P>
<P>
Concessions for planned dredging from Santa Fe to the
Paraguayan capital of Asuncion, and the dredging of the Uruguay
River between the Uruguayan city of Concepcion and the Argentine
province of Entre Rios were also announced.
</P>
<P>
The next tender for bids will cover a 1,722-kilometer dredging
project in Argentina, due to be concluded in 1998. The cost for
the first stage of it is estimated at 37 million U.S. dollars and
the annual maintenance cost at 12 million.
</P>
<P>
Once finished, the waterway will connect the Pantanal region on
the Brazilian-Bolivian border with the River de la Plata. It is
hoped that the waterway will allow bigger ships to carry more
freight and at lower cost between the three countries.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Still reeling from the
industrial collapse that followed the breakup of the Soviet Union,
Russia depends on imports for 80 percent of its consumer goods, a
top government official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country "is fully dependent on purchases made abroad," a
report of the Itar-Tass news agency today quoted Deputy Economy
Minister Ivan Starikov as saying.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a government commission, Starikov said the country
needs to lessen its dependence on foreign goods and attract
investment to develop its own producers.
</P>
<P>
He said that at least 160 countries are exporting goods to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Some officials at the meeting said Russia should impose
protectionist measures to protect domestic industries or increase
taxes upon foreign goods.
</P>
<P>
Russia's economy has been shrinking for six straight years. In
addition, the old Soviet system was not geared to produce the wide
variety of consumer goods people now demand.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Government and MRTA Guerillas Start New Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Peru's government and rebels
holding 72 hostages at the Japanese ambassador's residence here
started face-to-face talks today in a bid to resolve the
eight-week crisis.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian government negotiator Domingo Palermo and Rolly Rojas,
second-in-command of the MRTA guerillas, met at a safe house near
the residence for the talks, the first direct negotiations between
the two sides since Palermo, also education minister, met the
leader of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) inside the
ambassador's residence on December 28.
</P>
<P>
The talks are being supervised by a commission of guarantors
set up to negotiate an end to the crisis and made up of
representatives from the Vatican and the International Red Cross,
the Canadian ambassador to Peru and the Japanese ambassador to
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The commission announced in a communique that any information
on the talks will be handled with extreme discretion, saying both
sides agreed not to comment publicly over the content of the
discussions.
</P>
<P>
The commission expressed its hope that a peace solution would
be found soon to protect the lives and human dignity of the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori was optimistic about a
satisfactory outcome. He hoped talks with Rojas, a sociologist
with the nom de guerre "The Arab", would lead to formal
negotiations in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The hostage crisis started on December 17, 1996, when 22 MRTA
guerrillas took over the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima,
taking more than 500 cocktail party guests hostage to press for
the release of their 400 comrades jailed in Peru.
</P>
<P>
Most of the hostages have now been freed but the rebels are
still holding 72 key people, including two Peruvian ministers, the
Japanese and Bolivian ambassadors, some Japanese businessmen and
Fujimori's brother.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Company Begins Oil Drilling in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The ARCO of the United States
has begun oil drilling on Myanmar's coast waters after conducting
a seismic survey with the state-run Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise
(MOGE).
</P>
<P>
According to today's official paper the New Light of Myanmar,
the drilling is being conducted at the Shwepyihtay test well-1 at
block M-9 as an initial step as the results of the survey work
have indicated good prospects to get oil and gas at the block.
</P>
<P>
The Shwepyihtay test well-1, which is located off Mottama
coast, about 296 kilometers south of Yangon, will be drilled up to
3.2 kilometer depth, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. company signed the production sharing contract with
the MOGE in July 1995 for exploration of oil and natural gas at
the block.
</P>
<P>
Exploration is also being done at another block, which is M-7,
by the U.S. company under its second contract signed with Myanmar
last May.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, Myanmar has signed over 20
production- sharing contracts with oil companies from nearly 10
countries including Australia, Britain, France, Indonesia, Japan,
Malaysia, Thailand and the United States, and foreign investment
in the oil and gas sector had reached 1.49 billion U.S. dollars in
31 permitted projects as of the end of 1996.

<HEADLINE> New Limits Coming for Beijing's Large Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital will issue
a blueprint to control the development of large retail outlets --
shopping centers, supermarkets and department stores.
</P>
<P>
The move is to achieve a reasonable distribution of large-scale
retail outlets throughout the city, with an 11 million population,
and to avoid repetitious construction, said local officials.
</P>
<P>
The locations of shopping centers occupying areas of more than
10,000 square meters will have to conform to the city's overall
planning strategy, said Zang Hongge, chairman of the Beijing
Municipal Commercial Commission.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has 66 shopping centers of that size. Another 30 are
under construction.
</P>
<P>
A detailed explanation of Beijing's overall planning policies
will be released soon by the commercial commission to help guide
and regulate the development of local stores.
</P>
<P>
Experts will be called in to re-examine the plans of large
department stores not yet under construction. New projects out of
step with the city's overall planning policy will be halted.
</P>
<P>
To better distribute retail outlets throughout the huge city,
the local government will support the development of retail
outlets in residential areas. Commodity distribution centers for
chain stores and warehouse facilities also will receive official
support to ensure a more reasonable distribution of business
outlets.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has experienced a boom in large department store
construction in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In the Seventh Five-Year Plan period (1986-1990), the city
contained only eight department stores larger than 10,000 square
meters.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 100 shopping centers, each of more than
10,000 square meters, will be opened in Beijing by the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
However, the concentration of large department stores in
certain areas and the repetitious offering of identical products
have defeated management plans to achieve their own commercial
goals and caused a serious waste of labor and material resources.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the local commercial commission showed that
among 41 shopping centers which turn over an average of more than
100 million yuan (about 12 million US dollars) per year, 17
experienced a drop in profits in 1996, compared to the previous
year.

aggravated by her family's financial problems. She left home with
four children after fighting with her husband Salvatore Musumeci.
</P>
<P>
After stopping at a gas station to buy gasoline and then
driving for a dozen kilometers, Lo Faro pulled over to the side of
the expressway, doused herself in gasoline and set herself on fire.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Control over Rural Enterprises Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- New rural enterprises will
undergo more strict environmental examination before they open to
prevent possible industrial pollution, the Ministry of Agriculture
said.
</P>
<P>
While more than 23 million township enterprises contribute half
of the country's industrial output, they disgorge one-fifth of the
country's waste water, gas and residue, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Their sparse distribution in the vast countryside and urban
areas poses a threat to agricultural development. In this sense,
the ministry's Township Enterprises Bureau has vowed to strengthen
checks on enterprises set to open.
</P>
<P>
Before opening an enterprise, applicants must submit
environmental impact reports on their activities to local
administrative departments, said the bureau's vice-director Zong
Jinyao.
</P>
<P>
Projects, which are considered to be light-polluting within
national limits, are asked to be equipped with pollution-proof
facilities, which must be put into use the same time as the main
projects. Meanwhile, township enterprises are on a national
campaign to change from being resource-dependent to
technology-oriented.
</P>
<P>
The Agricultural Bank of China and the National Environmental
Protection Agency said late last month they will grant no loans to
small enterprises with serious pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
By last December, 50,000 rural enterprises, involving
pulp-making, hide-processing, chemical industries and some others
which seriously polluted the environment, had been closed by the
government.
</P>
<P>
With an average 5.7 workers per firm, a total of 285,000 people
will have to be transferred to other business or laid off.
</P>
<P>
Another 10,000 heavy-polluting firms have been blacklisted and
will be closed down.
</P>
<P>
The factories include paper mills with an annual output of less
than 5,000 tons, tanneries producing less than 30,000 pieces of
cow leather annually and factories producing less than 500 tons of
dye a year.

<HEADLINE> China's Rubber Inventory to Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 12 (Xinhua) -- China's rubber supply is
likely to continue to surge this year, but imports will remain
high, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The paper said rubber supply surged 22.6 percent to 1.89
million tons last year, compared with 1.46 million tons in 1995.
Total consumption grew seven percent to 1.4 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The glut of last year will add to this year's rubber supply,"
the paper quoted Chen Guoying, secretary-general of the Chinese
Rubber Industry Association, as saying.
</P>
<P>
China produced 973,000 tons of rubber last year, with synthetic
rubber accounting for 56 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the world's top four rubber consumers. Domestic
supply remains far below demand since China's tyre industry, the
biggest rubber consumer, is thriving.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that rubber imports will stay at around 50
percent of annual consumption.
</P>
<P>
Imports in 1996 hit 917,000 tons, jumping 45.1 percent from
1995. Imports of natural rubber reached 550,000 tons, soaring 72.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
"The price decline in the international rubber market partly
resulted in the surge in imports last year," said zhao Wenqing,
deputy director of the Ministry of Chemical Industry's rubber
division.
</P>
<P>
The oversupply of rubber last year also prompted a plunge in
the domestic price to around 13,000 yuan (1,566 US dollars) per
ton, down from the record high of 18,000 yuan (2,166 US dollars)
per ton in the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise in rubber prices during 1994-95 left domestic
rubber consumers reeling under the weight of escalating costs.
</P>
<P>
"This year's price is likely to continue decreasing, but at the
same pace as last year," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Total tyre production in 1996 is estimated at 61 million tons,
with unsold stock surging 20 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Despite the slump in tyre production, experts predict rubber
demand will increase five percent to 1.47 million tons this
year. Domestic production is estimated at 1.05 million tons this
year.
</P>
<P>
"The import of rubber, annually accounting for half of the
nation's consumption, will see a slight decline because of last
year's inventory," Chen said.

These minerals will boost the production of fertilizer, fodder
and pesticides, said Li Lierong, director of the ministry's
Department of Geological Environment.
</P>
<P>
Minerals such as sylvite, phosphorus and sulphur are widely
used abroad to produce fertilizers, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Studies show China will need 150 million tons of fertilizers by
2000.
</P>
<P>
China has discovered 4.3 billion tons of sulphur and iron ore
and 15.7 billion tons of phosphorus ore, enough to meet the demand
for sulphur and phosphorus fertilizer production.
</P>
<P>
Although the ministry discovered 400 million tons of sylvite
ore, more reserves need to be found to produce enough potash
fertilizer by 2000, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also try to discover sufficient mineral
supplies to improve fodder production, Li said.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 minerals which can raise crop or livestock yields
are found in China.
</P>
<P>
Li also said his ministry will study, with agricultural and
chemical departments, the use of minerals in pesticide
production.

<P>
PARIS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Estonia held Scotland to a 0-0
tie in a replayed World Cup qualifying game in Monte Carlo on
Tuesday, four months after it failed to show up for the game.
</P>
<P>
Scotland squandered several chances and Estonia goalkeeper Mart
Poom made a series of saves to keep the Group Four leader
goal-less at Monaco's Louis II Stadium.
</P>
<P>
The result will be a major disappointment for the Scots who
claimed all three points after the Estonians failed to appear for
the October 9 game in Tallinn. FIFA disagreed and ordered the
replay.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Scotland earned only one point for a total of eight
from four games, one more then Austria which has seven from
three. Scotland has six from four and Estonia and Belarus have
four.
</P>
<P>
The Estonians refused to show up for the Oct. 9 match after
FIFA ordered that the kickoff be moved up four hours because of
the lack of proper floodlights at the Kadriorg Stadium.

<HEADLINE> EU Goes to WTO over Japanese Pork Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has
decided to go to the World Trade Organization for consultations
with Japan over what it regards as Japan's failure to administer
the import of frozen pork in a uniform, impartial and reasonable
manner.
</P>
<P>
The EU made the decision in response to the "emergency
measures' introduced by Japan on pork imports for five months
between November 1 of 1995 and March 31 of last year, according to
a press release issued here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The EU claims that the periodic use of emergency import
restrictions by Japan since November 1995 has caused market
disruption, effectively pricing European, mainly Danish, pork
exports out of the Japanese market for most of the year.
</P>
<P>
It believes that the way these emergency measures are being
used contravenes the terms of the Uruguay Round Agreement. Canada
has announced that it will join the EU's request for WTO
consultations.
</P>
<P>
Under the Uruguay Round, any such emergency measure must be
administered in a uniform, impartial and reasonable manner, and
the distribution of tariff quotas should approximately reflect the
market share of the existing suppliers to the market so as to
avoid any discrimination.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Parliament Passes Law to Reinstate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian parliament passed
a special law Tuesday to reinstate the opposition victory in
November's local elections.
</P>
<P>
The law, drafted by the Serbian government under instruction of
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic on February 4, was passed by
130 parliament deputies present at the special session. It
finalizes the preliminary results of municipal elections in
Serbian cities listed in a report by a mission of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe and confirms the victories
of the opposition coalition Zajedno in the local elections.
</P>
<P>
Constituent sessions of the municipal and city assemblies will
be called by the parliament speaker within five days of the
promulgation of the law.
</P>
<P>
The election of deputies is established by municipal elections
commissions, or city election commissions, within three days of
the law taking effect.
</P>
<P>
If the election commissions fail to comply within the mentioned
period of time, the ministry of justice will establish the
individual election of deputies within the next 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
The law takes effect the day after it is published in the
Serbian official gazette.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian government hopes that the law would end the
political crisis that was sparked off by a court ruling to annul
the local election results since November 19 when the opposition
took to the streets to protest over the annulment.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition, while welcoming the adoption of the
special law, continued their street protest on Tuesday that began
82 days ago. Zajedno leaders say they would not cease their
demonstrations until all their demands were met, that include the
freedom of mass media and democracy in the country.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Helps Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved two
loans of 283 million U.S. dollars in total for Peru to help it
reduce debt to commercial banks and private suppliers.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement of the Bank, one loan of 183
million U.S. dollars is entitled Debt and Debt Service Reduction
loan, and the other loan of 100 million U.S. dollars is called
Pension Reform Adjustment loan.
</P>
<P>
These loans will support Peru's finance agreement with its
private creditors that will restructure 7.98 billion U.S. dollars
of its commercial debt. The combined loan agreements are a vital
step in further consolidating the country's economic recovery and
financial stability, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the finance plan the Peruvian government agreed
with its foreign private creditors and being supported by the
World Bank goes a long way to further integrate Peru into the
international financial community and confirm investor confidence
in the country.

NEW YORK, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar hit a
33-month high against the mark Tuesday in a broad rally.
</P>
<P>
Widespread mark weakness and an underlying demand for dollars
spurred the advance of the U.S. currency.

The dollar reached an intraday high of 1.6810 marks, the
strongest since May 1994, before settling in New York at 1.6766
marks, up from 1.6560 marks Monday. For the year, the dollar is up
nearly 8.8 percent against the mark.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar settled in New York at 123.15 yen, up from
122.78 yen Monday, and only 1.55 yen lower than its intraday
four-year high reached last Friday.

<HEADLINE> Albright Defends Foreign Affairs Budget Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright today defended a budget increase on foreign
affairs, proposed by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"During the last four years, the State Department has cut more
than 2,000 employees and closed more than 30 overseas posts, and
we have slashed foreign assistance by almost one third," Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
"This trend cannot continue," she told the House of
Representatives International Relations Committee, adding that
"diplomatically, we are steadily and unilaterally disarming
ourselves" under such current trends.
</P>
<P>
"Spending on international affairs now constitutes barely one
percent of the federal budget," she added.
</P>
<P>
"If this small amount were to be cut further, it is out
influence in the world, not the deficit, that would decline," she
said. "Diplomatic readiness is not a luxury; it is an imperative."
</P>
<P>
In his budget plan for the fiscal year of 1998 sent to Congress
last week for approval, Clinton proposed an increase of over six
percent over 1997 to a total of 19.4 billion U.S. dollars for
foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Gilman, chairman of the House International Relations
Committee, told Albright that Congress was ready to work with her
on the budget plan.
</P>
<P>
The budget request, plus a 3.5 billion U.S. dollars "general
agreement to borrow" for the International Monetary Fund and 920
million dollars arrears payment for the United Nations by 1999, is
certainly "a tall order", Gilman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Albright also issues new appeal for NATO
enlargement. A long delay in expanding NATO would create a
"permanent source of tension and insecurity in the heart of
Europe", she testified before the Committee.
</P>
<P>
The "right approach", she stressed, is to proceed with a
"careful and transparent" process of expansion while "offering to
Russia the opportunity to be a full partner".
</P>
<P>
"To that end, NATO has proposed a formal charter to Russia that
will allow us to cooperate, consult, train and respond to crises
together," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We have made steady progress toward this goal, which will be a
major subject of my discussions in Europe," she noted.

<HEADLINE> EU Official Hits Back at Critics of EU Social Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A European Union commissioner
today hit back at those who blame the Union for over-regulation
which they claim have been killing business.
</P>
<P>
Padraig Flynn, EU commissioner in charge of employment and
social affairs, struck the counterblow when he was speaking
Tuesday in Brussels to the British Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said that today's reality consisted of
navigating a path between "the rabid deregulators, who offer us
the low pay, low productivity route and those within an equally
rigid view of social progress, who see change as anathema and
offer us only the high unemployment...and dual labor market
route."
</P>
<P>
What is needed is "new approaches to skills, work organization
and re-integration into the labor market...new partnerships
between government, business and organized labor, and a new focus
on investment in people for productivity growth and competitive
success," he said.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner pointed out that social legislation was mainly
a matter for national authorities and that provision at European
level was only concerned with equal opportunities, free movement
of workers, health and safety in the workplace and classic labor
law.
</P>
<P>
He said that a competitive economy could not be created in a
social wasteland, adding that they should not oversimplify any
change in the EU's social policy.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Americans to Respect Simpson Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today urged the Americans to respect to the O.J. Simpson jury
verdict despite the general disagreement between the blacks and
whites on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
"It terms of the jury verdict, that's the system we have in
America. It's over as far as I'm concerned," Clinton said in a
brief exchange with reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"We need to get on to other things. But we always need to be
working on how to bridge these divides between us," Clinton said,
asking the blacks and whites to "spend more than listening to each
other."
</P>
<P>
A mostly white jury decided on last Tuesday that Simpson was
responsible for the slayings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson
and her friend Ronald Goldman two and a half years ago. The same
jury again decided on Monday to impose a 25 million U.S. dollar
punishment on the former football star for the slayings, based on
a 8.5 million dollars in compensatory damages awarded last week.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, a mostly black jury acquitted Simpson of
criminal charges in October 1995. After the jury's decision,
Clinton also said Americans should respect the verdict, concerning
the racial disagreement in the country.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion polls show that most white Americans believed
Simpson committed the murders while a majority of blacks believed
he was innocent.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of the way Americans see the world differently,
generally, based on their race, that troubles me," Clinton said
today. "I think the only answer to that is for us to spend more
time listening to each other and try to put ourselves in each
other's shoes and understand why we see the world in different
ways and keep trying to overcome that."
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of social harmony in the nation.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Meets with Klein on Eastern Slavonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic held talks here Tuesday with U.N. Administrator of the
Eastern Slavonia region Jacques Klein over the regional situation.
</P>
<P>
A Serbian presidential office said in a statement that the two
sides exchanged views on further implementation of the Erdut
agreement, signed in November 1995 between local Serb authority in
Eastern Slavonia and the Croatian government.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Eastern Slavonia region, located in
northeastern Croatia bordering Yugoslavia and dominated by
Croatian Serbs, was put under the U.N. Transitional Administration
in the Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES) for 12 months since early 1996.
The transitional period has been extended for another six months
and the U.N. mandate expires in next July if no further extension
was demanded by local Serbs.
</P>
<P>
At the talks, Milosevic stressed the importance of the
Serb-Croatian relations in the region, and called for a consistent
implementation of the Erdut agreement which will be an important
element of the promotion of those relations, according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
"The role of the U.N. transitional administration is of great
importance and that is why administrator Klein and his team are
expected to show the necessary understanding for constructive
proposals and demands of the Serb side," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian president also stressed that the U.N. transitional
administration should especially help create an atmosphere of
confidence, personal security, security of the property, and equal
rights of citizens in the region.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic also asked for creating conditions for an
equality-based participation of all inhabitants in the upcoming
elections in the Eastern Slavonia region, so that the elections
could be held in a democratic atmosphere and could be free and
fair.

<HEADLINE> Iraq's UN Envoy Demands Speedier Delivery of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 11 (Xinhua) --Iraq's envoy to the
United Nations has complained that food supplies under an
"oil-for-food" plan were taking too long to arrive, and urged the
United Nations to take effective measures for speedier delivery of
the supplies, U.N. sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's U.N. envoy Nizar Hamdoon lodged the complaints when
meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan late Monday, the
sources said. He also appealed to non-aligned members of the U.N.
Security Council today to support his demand for quicker delivery
of the food supplies.
</P>
<P>
Under the "oil-for-food" agreement which took effect on
December 10, Iraq has been permitted to sell 2 billion U.S.
dollars worth of oil over six months to buy food, medicine and
other necessaries to offset the effects of U.N. sanctions imposed
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Some 155 U.N.
monitors have been sent to Iraq to ensure equitable distribution
of the humanitarian food and medicine supplies.
</P>
<P>
But Hamdoon told reporters Monday that no food supplies had
reached his country, and the U.N. Security Council's sanction
committee was slow in approving the supply plans and deliveries.
</P>
<P>
In response, Annan's spokesman Fred Eckhard told reporters at
the press briefing today that the U.N. chief had promised to give
Iraq more details on the deliveries and asked Hamdoon to relay
"operational" matters to the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
Some U.N. sources complained that Baghdad was "hindering
operations" for the food supplies on the ground.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the operational issues included
getting permission to use the airport in Baghdad rather than drive
goods and personnel in from Jordan, allowing U.N. monitors to have
their own communications and letting them move around freely
without a Iraqi government escort.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard admitted that Iraq's oil sales had reached 386 million
U.S. dollars but only 113 million U.S. dollars had been dispersed.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that four contracts for foodstuffs had been
approved, including 21 million U.S. dollars for French wheat and
50 million U.S. dollars for Australian wheat.
</P>
<P>
Taking up Iraq's complaint, Russia has asked U.N. officials to
give the Security Council a briefing later this week on precisely
what food supplies were in the pipeline and when they could reach
Iraq, diplomats said.

<HEADLINE> Spread of HIV Affects Canadian Youth, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The epidemic of HIV infection
appears to be growing in Canada, especially among drug users and
young people.
</P>
<P>
The median age for new infections is now 23, down from 32 in
the early 1980s when the epidemic first hit Canada, the Globe and
Mail newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The lowering of age means that a great number of people now
being diagnosed with HIV must have been infected as teenagers,
since there can be a long delay between contracting the virus and
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
The majority of all HIV infections probably begin in the peak
years of sexual activity, between 15 and 25, and many of those
infected tended to ignore the dangers of contracting AIDS out of
bravado, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the rate of new infections has declined
dramatically among older Canadians, who are apparently taking
precautions.
</P>
<P>
A number of recent statistical analyses show a rising rate of
infection with HIV, which causes AIDS, the paper said. It didn't
give specific figures for the rate.
</P>
<P>
By September 30, 1996, at least 72 percent of the 14,185
Canadians with AIDS reported have died. Another 10,000 to 12,000
cases are expected to be reported through the year 2000, the paper
added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Studies WFP's Appeal for DPRK Food Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
considering to contribute emergency food aid to the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in response to a new appeal from
the U.N. World Food Program for urgent international assistance,
the State Department said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the World Food Program, in its third
international appeal ever since the past year, asked the
international community to provide a total of 100,000 metric tons
of food, valued at 41.6 million US dollars, for relief of grain
shortage in the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said: "I
understand the World Food Program today issued a new emergency
appeal for humanitarian assistance to North Korea. The World Food
Program is seeking donations of 100,000 metric tons of food valued
at roughly 41.6 million dollars."
</P>
<P>
Burns said the Clinton administration was "very seriously"
studying the request but would consult with allies like South
Korea and Japan before deciding whether and how much to
contribute. A senior official, speaking anonymously, said: "I
believe the United States will make decision to contribute."
</P>
<P>
Burns stressed the humanitarian relief would not be linked to
other issues such as negotiations between the DPRK and Cargill
Inc. a Minnesota-based grain trader, which has run aground over a
deal of importing 500,000 tons of grain to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
He said the breakdown of the negotiations had no bearing on a
decision to contribute to the World Food Program effort.

LONDON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government announced
in Dublin today that it would set up a working group to fight
against the illegal use of the Internet.
</P>

Irish Prime Minister John Bruton said in a statement that the
main task of the working group was to focus on "such issues with
particular reference to the need to address the issue of child
pornography (on the Internet) in the short term."
</P>
<P>
The government group was also charged with drawing up various
recommendations to crack down on Internet abuse across the
country, according to press reports from Dublin.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Cabinet Reshuffled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian government was
reshuffled Tuesday at the proposal of Serbian Premier Mirko
Marjanovic with one vice-premier and nine new ministers being
brought into the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle was made at the Serbian parliament session which
is also expected to approve a "special law" on the reinstatement
of the election results annulled in November by the Serbian
government.
</P>
<P>
Serbia and Montenegro, the two leftover republics of the former
Yugoslavia, formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in April of
1992 after the other four republics -- Slovenia, Croatia,
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia -- gained independence in 1991
and early 1992.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet change was apparently a concession of the Serbian
government under pressure from the opposition coalition Zajedno
which has led daily demonstrations over the past 80 days to
protest against the Serbian government for annulling the November
local election results.
</P>
<P>
According to Tanjug news agency, Milutin Stojkovic, former
assembly speaker of Serbia's northern province Vojvodina, was
appointed vice-premier to replace Slobodan Babic, who was relieved
of post.
</P>
<P>
Ministers of mining and power industry, tourism, industry,
education and agriculture were replaced with new faces while heads
of three newly-formed ministries -- economic and ownership
transformation, self-government and family care -- were appointed.
A minister without portfolio was added into the cabinet, and the
ministry for private entrepreneurship was dissolved.
</P>
<P>
In the new cabinet, there are a prime minister, four
vice-premiers, and 26 ministers, including three ministers without
portfolio.
