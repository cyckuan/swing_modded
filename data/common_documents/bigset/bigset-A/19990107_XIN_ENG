<HEADLINE> Yearender: Peace Process Uncertain After Back on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 6 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
....the Labor Party was rejected,
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had no way to go but early elections.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel is moving into a long campaign period which will
last till May 17 -- the scheduled date for the elections, it is
likely that the stalemate in the peace process will continue.
</P>
<P>
Even if the current Israeli government chooses to go ahead
with the peace accord to appeal to the majority of Israelis,
it is almost impossible for the two sides to reach a permanent
solution to the toughest issues in the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The gaps on these issues such as the final status of
the Palestinian territories, the fate of Jerusalem, Jewish
settlements and Palestinian refugees, are much wider than those
on interim issues. And the two sides have yet to start the
talks on these issues.
</P>
<P>
The stalemate in the peace accord and the turmoil in
Israel's political stage puts Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat in a difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
Since the Wye agreement was signed, Arafat has taken a
series of steps to crack down militant groups and collect
illegal weapons. He also convened the Palestinian National Council
to annul the anti-Israel clauses in the Palestinian charter in
the presence of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
But he has gained little concession from the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
Israel transferred only 2 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinians. It freed 250 Palestinian prisoners - the first
group of a total of 750 prisoners to be released under the
agreement -- but most of them are common criminals instead of
political prisoners as the Palestinians hoped for.
</P>
<P>
As a fruit of the peace agreement, a Palestinian airport
in Gaza was opened after more than two years of delay. But
Israel has threatened recently to close the airport due to
emerging security disputes between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that as the stalemate drags on, more and
more frustrated Palestinians may lend their support to militant
groups like Hamas, which has staged a string of terror attacks
in Israel aimed at wrecking the peace process.
</P>
<P>
This would set back Arafat's efforts to stem violence that
could drive a hard-line party into power just as what happened
in Israel's previous elections in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Another decision Arafat has to make is whether he shall
go ahead with his repeated pledge to declare a Palestinian
state on May 4, the deadline for the five-year interim period
set by the Oslo accords signed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel sets the elections date two weeks after May
4, Arafat's decision on the statehood will surely have a
decisive impact on the result of the elections, which will in
return decide the direction of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have sent mixed signals on this issue
recently. Some officials suggested that Arafat might put off his
declaration of statehood to avoid driving Israeli voters to elect
a hard-line candidate rather than a genuine peace partner.
</P>
<P>
Other officials, however, said the statehood plan will not be
affected by Israel's elections and therefore a Palestinian state
will be declared on May 4 as scheduled. The internal debate may
continue but a choice has to be made before May 4.
</P>
<P>
Many believe that the early elections in Israel might actually
turn out to be a blessing for the peace process. After seeing more
than two years of stalemate and conflicts, it is hard to imagine
that Israel's electorate will allow the current situation, under
which the government is held hostage by a few hard-liners who
oppose the will of most people, to repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that any new government --no matter headed by
Netanyahu again or by anyone else -- will become more responsive
to the interests and demands of the large majority of the
Israelis, that is to move the peace process forward.

CAIRO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT -- A senior Kuwaiti diplomatic source has disclosed that
Kuwait will consider providing crude oil to Jordan if Iraq stops
its supply upon the restoration of Jordanian-Kuwaiti ties.
</P>
<P>
The offer will be raised during the visit of Jordanian Foreign
Minister Abdul Ialh Al Khatib to Kuwait in March, Egyptian Arabic
Alam Al Yom newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The World Bank expects an annual economic growth of
no-more-than 2.7 percent in Algeria between 2000 and 2002, the
Alam Al Yom reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bank stressed Algeria is being considered as one of the
most seriously hit countries by the world economic crisis,
particularly with regard to the sagging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Over 18,400 Israeli companies suffered cash flow
problems in 1998, a 9 percent rise from 1997, according to a
survey conducted by consultancy Business Data Israel.
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, the survey said, over 1,500 local
companies experienced liquidity problems.

JERUSALEM -- Israel's economic growth rate in 1998 fell to a
decade low of 1.9 percent, according to Israel's Central Bureau of

The CBS said the country's economy will experience
pre-elections and post-elections periods in 1999.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Bank of Israel, the country's central bank, said
that based on preliminary data, it ended fiscal 1998 with a surplus
of 5.45 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the bank also saw a sharp growth in receipts in
shekel's term due to the dollar's appreciation in October.

The bank left the key interest rate unchanged at 13.5 percent
in January this year to maintain price stability.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Industry and Trade Minister Natan
Sharansky signed an agreement here Tuesday with his Argentine
counterpart Alieto Guadagni to promote bilateral trade and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, bilateral trade totaled 200 million dollars.
Argentina exported mostly agricultural and food products to
Israel and imported machinery, chemicals and plastics from
Israel.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran has produced over 4.17 million tonnes of
unprocessed steel in the first nine months of the current Iranian
calendar year ending March 20 in 1999.

Mussa Aqaie Lankarani, deputy head of the National Iranian
Steel Company, told the Islamic Republic News Agency that the
figure was only 89 percent of the projection for the period.
</P>
<P>
Some 6 million tonnes of unprocessed steel and about 5 million
tonnes of final products are expected to be produced by the end of
this Iranian year, Lankarani said,
</P>
<P>
He also said that Iran produced 6.06 million tonnes of

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia could not trust
chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler any longer, Sergey
Lavrov, Russia's ambassador to the Untied Nations, said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov made the statement when asked to comment on a report in
the Washington Post which says that the Untied Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction had helped the United States intelligence agents
to spy on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov said the Washington Post must have proof for what they
were writing.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said, "We have been saying that UNSCOM must be
reformed and that the the report triggering the U.S.-led air
strikes against Iraq last month is a provocation, and it is an
inaccurate report telling half the truth and sometimes not telling
the truth."
</P>
<P>
"We have said after the report that we cannot trust Butler and
this position stays," he added.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Police Boss Defends Promotion of Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's police boss has defended the
recent promotion of police officers, saying that the promotion is based on
merit instead of ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
John Kisembo, the Acting Inspector General of Police, made the remarks
at a press conference at Police Headquarters here Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
On corruption in the police force,  Kisembo said a complaint desk has
been
established at the headquarters while a suggestion box will be introduced
at each police station.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to strengthen the National Flow Squad and advised the
general public not to facilitate corruption.
</P>
<P>
Kisembo, former deputy inspector general of police, was recently
appointed to this post following former inspector-general of police, Cossy
Odomel, announced his resignation at an end-of-the-year party hosted for
senior police officers.
</P>
<P>
Odomel said that he was forced by President Yoweri Museveni to step
down. A newspaper report said that he was found abusing his office and
running businesses which supply materials for the police force.
</P>
<P>
Many senior police commanders said that they were shocked at the news
of 43-year-old Odomel's resignation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Home Sales Jump to Record in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. sales of new homes
jumped 7.6 percent to a record in November, the Commerce
Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Stimulating by low interest rates, unseasonable warmth and a
strong economy, people purchased new homes at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 965,000 in November.
</P>
<P>
November's increase was the largest in a year. And, even
without December's number, the 823,000 homes sold during the first
11 months of the year have already reached an annual record,
surpassing the 819,000 homes sold during 1977.
</P>
<P>
November marked the 15th consecutive month of sales rates above
800,000, also a record.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that a variety of factors have come together to
make 1998 a strong year for housing. First, jobs are plentiful,
with the unemployment rate this year averaging around 4.5 percent
at a 28-year low. Second, mortgage rates have remained below 7
percent since June, a stretch unseen in 30 years. Third, the stock
market, though tumultuous, has increased many Americans' wealth.
</P>
<P>
In addition, unusually warm weather in November also gave sales
an added boost for the month.
</P>
<P>
The number of homes for sale at the end of November totaled
292,000 -- 3.7 months supply at the current sales rate. It is a
record low inventory.

MOSCOW, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Moscow is certain that the

the European Union, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir
Rakhmanin said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of the euro, based on the broad economic
foundation of the Western European market and dynamically
developing industry, will noticeably influence economic relations
between the European Union and its leading trade partners,
including Russia," Interfax quoted Rakhmanin as saying at a

</P>
<P>
"Europe's financial market is potentially the largest source of
direct investments in the Russian economy, including those through
government channels and the private sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The euro may give an additional stimulus to accelerate
economic growth in Europe, which should help to increase Russian
exports to this region," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The integration of the financial markets of the European
Monetary Union countries will give their partners, including
Russia, wider access to commercial loans, including syndicated
loans denominated in the euro," Rakhmanin said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Cabinet Approves Reform Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti government Wednesday
approved a comprehensive economic reform package aimed at helping
the oil-rich state withstand a serious economic crisis due to the
sagging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The package was passed at a special cabinet session and has
been submitted to the National Assembly (parliament) for approval,
the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State for Cabinet
Affairs Abdel Aziz Deckeel Al-Dekheel said after the meeting that
all details related to the goals of the reforms were discussed.
But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The government-proposed reform package has recently become the
main topic of both Kuwaitis and expatriates. Though it has yet to
be made public, part of its items have been learned from the
remarks of some of the ministers.
</P>
<P>
Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah said last Monday that
the government will launch reforms that can lead to the cost of
basic services rising up to about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Sheikh Ali Salem Al-Ali Al-Sabah said that the
government will increase charges by 10 to 30 percent on
state-rendered services, such as government property, electricity
and water.
</P>
<P>
"The steps will be taken in view of the increasing pressure on
the state budget," he said.
</P>
<P>
The latest financial report showed the state deficit had
exceeded 50 percent of the budget and is expected to mount because
of the sagging oil prices, he added. The projected deficit for
fiscal 1998 was 2.162 billion Kuwaiti dinars (7.13 billion
U.S. dollars), accounting for 49.5 percent of the state budget.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah has urged

<HEADLINE> IMF Urges Zimbabwe to Clarify Land Reform Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
HARARE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will have to wait a little
longer before the International Monetary Fund (IMF) releases the 157
million U.S. Dollars balance of payment support it badly needs.
</P>
<P>
IMF head of the African department, Goodall Gondwe, Wednesday said the
institution is still holding discussions with the Zimbabwean government on
the country's land reforms.
</P>
<P>
 "All we are concerned with is how the land reform is going to
implemented so that it does not impact negatively on agricultural
production,"
Gondwe told journalists after briefing Zimbabwe's Vice-President Simon
Muzenda on the talks.
</P>
<P>
He said the negotiations, scheduled to end late Wednesday,
will continue and his team will return to Zimbabwe within a few days for
further consultations if there are still outstanding issues on land.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team had been satisfied with the government's
explanation on its participation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
war and the 1998 budget performance, he said..
</P>
<P>
"I must say that the government has been very open with us on a number
of matters we discussed, particularly on the DRC war," Gondwe said.
</P>
<P>
"We reviewed the progress Zimbabwe is doing on the budget...Zimbabwe
has made excellent performance in this respect," he added.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Underlines Entwinement of Lebanese-Syrian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
Wednesday reaffirmed his country will uphold the entwinement of
its peace track with the Syrian one in the peace process with
Israel, opposing any attempt to separate them.
</P>
<P>
"The truth is with Lebanon and from the truth the resistance
movement come," Lahoud said in an annual meeting with foreign
ambassadors in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He was alluding to Lebanese guerrillas-led anti-occupation
campaign to oust Israeli forces out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud said the peace Lebanon believes is not a part
withdrawal only from Lebanese territory, which will only lead to
a half peace and don't serve the regional security.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his country's national interest falls within
the overall Israeli withdrawal from both Lebanon and Syria in
any cases and conditions.
</P>
<P>
About 40,000 Syrian troops are currently stationed in
Lebanon. Both the two countries have insisted that their peace
negotiations with Israel be carried out simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel has been attempting to separate the two
tracks and reach a peace deal with Lebanon first.
</P>
<P>
Last April, Israel offered to withdraw its troops from Lebanon
with a condition that Beirut agreed to meet its security
arrangements in advance.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria rejected the offer, urging the Jewish state
to leave the country without any preconditions, as stipulated in
the United Nations Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Israel is also in control of Syria's Golan Heights it captured
in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Lebanon will be committed to
achieving a lasting and overall peace which he said is a real
guarantee for all countries's security in the region.

<HEADLINE> IMF Spells out Role of Governments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
HARARE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior International Monetary Fund
(IMF) official wednesday spelt out the dual role of governments as that of
social development and promoting the growth of private sector.
</P>
<P>
In an interveiw with the Zimbabwe News Agency, IMF African
Department Director, Goodall Gondwe, said that governments need to put in
place policies that provide the business sector with a conducive
environment for growth.
</P>
<P>
Gondwe, who is in Zimbabwe on a mission to clarify national economic
issues ahead of the release of balance of payments support, noted that on
cutting back expenditure, the governments should not sacrifice the sectors
of health and education.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that governments should emphasise development of
education and health, actually expenditure should be increased in these
areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and the World Bank have for years been champions of economic
reforms being implemented in most developing countries.
</P>
<P>
 But the economic reform process in the country has entailed cutting
back of government expenditure mostly to the detriment of the social
services of welfare, health and education.
</P>
<P>
"Previously we asked governments to reduce expenditure globally, but
now we are saying they have to ensure that education and health are not
affected," Gondwe said.
</P>
<P>
He said however the role of government in policy-making should not make
it difficult for private sector to operate.
</P>
<P>
Reducing the role of government in national economics is part of the
reform programs which perceives the private sector as the engine for growth
and subsequent national development, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, China Sign Political Consultation Mechanism Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 NAIROBI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
signed here Wednesday an agreement with his Kenyan counterpart Bonaya
Godana on establishing Sino-Kenyan political consultation mechanism in a
bid to deepen the friendly relations and cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, officials at ministerial or director-general
levels of the two countries shall meet regularly or otherwise alternately
in their capitals for consultations on their bilateral relations and
regional and international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, which Godana described as "an important milestone" in
Sino-Kenyan 35-year-old relationship, will take effect immediately and will

remain in force for four years.
</P>
<P>
 At the signing ceremony, Godana expressed thanks for China's long-
term, sincere and unconditional assistance. He called for more joint
efforts to
further consolidate the continuous and fruitful cooperation between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Kenya's firm stand on the "one China" policy which, he
noted, is helpful not only for Kenya's ties with China, but also for the
peace, prosperity and stability in the world.
</P>
<P>
 Tang said the signed accord is an important part of Sino-Kenyan
friendship which thereby will get fresh momentum for further higher-level,
over-all development.
</P>
<P>
" We are more than ready to join the Kenyan side ...to explore new
methods, new ways and new ideas, under new circumstance, to further expand
 our economic and trade cooperation," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
 Earlier on arrival at the airport from Egypt Wednesday, the Chinese
minister said his three-day visit to Kenya is aimed "to make friends,
step up consultation, enhance mutual understanding, expand common ground
and promote cooperation with Africa."
</P>
<P>
 Kenya is the second leg of Tang's 12-day, five-country tour in Africa
and also the first sub-Saharan African country Tang visited this year. He
will also pay visits to Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Prince Receives Message From Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Deputy Prime Minister
Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz Wednesday received a letter
from Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on regional developments.
</P>
<P>
The message was conveyed by Mohammad Ali, head of the office of
the Iranian President, during a meeting in Riyadh, the Kuwait News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Mohammad Nouri said the
letter was within the framework of perpetual consultations between
leaders of both countries on various regional developments.
</P>
<P>
"The current developments in the Arab and Islamic nations
require continued consolations," Nouri said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first message President Khatami sent to Abdullah
this year. Last year, about a dozen letters were conveyed from the
Iranian President, in which he discussed with Saudi leaders means
of enhancing bilateral ties, as well as coordinating their stances
on shoring up the sagging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Saudi Arabia, once in mistrust to each other for
almost two decades, began to improve their ties since President
Mohmmed Khatami, a political moderate, took office in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations between Tehran and Riyadh saw a big boost
since last February when Iran's former president Hashemi Rafsanjani
paid a 14-day official visit to the Gulf Kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Urged to Fight Drought with Effective Ways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Tanzanian meteorological
official Wednesday advised people to use effective ways to counter the
adverse effects of drought which grips most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Director General of the Directorate of Meteorology, Mohamed
Mhita, said in a statement issued in Dar es Salaam that farmers should take
full advantage of the rains and plant drought-resistant crops like maize,
sorghum, millet and cassava.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested farmers resort to small-scale irrigation, use
residual moisture in valleys for planting, and apply fertilizer, manure and
pesticides for better results.
</P>
<P>
Mhita also cautioned all Tanzanians to ensure food security at home by
keeping stocks for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
Predicting weather conditions, he said seasonal rains in Kigoma, Rukwa,
Mbeya, Iringa, Ruvuma regions will be from near normal to slightly below
normal.
</P>
<P>
Long rains over the northern part of the east African country will
commence around mid-March and are expected to last till Mid-May, with a
likelihood of rainfall deficits.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the rainfall deficit to cold episode conditions already
developed over the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and the associated
atmosphere circulation anomalies, typical of those experienced during cold
episode years, or La Nina periods.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye has appealed to the
international community to provide urgent food assistance to his country as
13 out of 20 Mainland regions are facing an acute shortage of food.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, Tanzania will have a food deficit of
some 600,000 tons because of bad weather last year and destructive pests,
Sumaye said while meeting diplomatic corps Tuesday in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources told Xinhua Wednesday that the World Food Program
(WFP) and donor countries will send teams to various parts of the country
to make their own assessment of the food situation.
</P>
<P>
The investigations are expected to be completed in two weeks, followed
by food relief deliveries in six weeks before the start of the long rains
season starting March, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
"In some regions, people are reported to have depleted their food
stocks and they are now facing serious shortages...this would lead to
famine for the poorest and most vulnerable of our people," said the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said the government has released 35,000 tons of food from the
Strategic Grain Reserves and will import 50,000 tons of food on emergency
basis. The duties on maize imports to encourage commercial imports have
been waived for the next three months.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Directorate of Meteorology reported that four regions
including Kigoma, Mbeya, Iringa and Ruvuma recorded seasonal rains during
January 1-3.

<HEADLINE> New DRC Refugees Flee to Neighboring Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Continued fighting between rebels and
the government forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has led to
a new exodus of refugees into neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the Nairobi Office of the U. N. High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) here Wednesday said that since last Saturday some 5,
000 terrified DRC refugees, most of them women and children, fled the town
of northwestern Zongo and crossed the border over the Ubangi River,
seeking safety in the Central African Republic's capital Bangui.
</P>
<P>
The refugees said they fled after gunfire erupted in and around the town
of Zongo and they feared it was about to fall in rebel hands.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR staff in Bangui could clearly hear the sound of gunfire coming
from the other side of the river and together with the local Red Cross
provided food and initial health care to the newly coming refugees.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, UNHCR staff over the past few days have registered more than
2,900 new refugees, also mainly women and children, arriving from DRC's
Rutshuru district into Uganda's Kisoro Province, the release said, adding
that several unaccompanied and malnourished children have been placed under
special care.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that UNHCR has transferred the new arrivals from the
border zone to Hoima district north on the eastern shores of Lake Albert,
where the Kyangwali settlement has already hosted several thousand refugees
who came earlier from the DRC.

LUSAKA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba will
leave here on Thursday for Kigali, capital of Rwanda, to discuss peace in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with his Rwandan counterpart Pasteur
Bizimungu.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba and his party will return home soon after the planned one-day
talks, a spokesman of the Zambian Foreign Ministry said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba announced Tuesday that the long awaited peace talks on the five-
month war in the DRC will be held here in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks will be attended for the first time by the rebels who
rose up in arms last August against DRC President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
He noted that all the warring parties in the DRC now agreed to meet to
iron out their differences.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka regional summit on the Congo peace has been postponed for
three times because Kabila refused to have direct talks with the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Israel Deports Another Three Cult Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 6 (Xinhua) - The Israeli Interior Ministry
Wednesday deported three members of a Denver-based doomsday cult,
the last group of the 14 members detained on suspicion of planning
violence.
</P>
<P>
The three, under interrogations for the last two days, denied
the allegations against them, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The 14 members of the Concerned Christians group were arrested
Sunday afternoon in a police raid on two residential units in the
suburbs of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Eleven of them had been deported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The cult members -- eight adults and six children -- arrived in
Israel in October. Israeli police said they planned to provoke a
gunfight by opening fire on policemen in order to hasten the
so-called "second coming of Jesus."
</P>
<P>
So far the 11 deportees have not filed appeals though they are
entitled to do so until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 14 were among some 78 members of the doomsday cult
disappearing from Denver and other U.S. cities in October. It is
not clear where the other 64 members have gone, the Jerusalem Post
daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As the millennium is approaching, four million tourists, most
of them Christians, are expected to visit Jerusalem in 1999, the
holy place for Christians as well as for Jews and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Israel has stepped up security in the city to prevent
apocalyptic cult members from provoking violence.
</P>
<P>
Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani has asked for an
increase in budget and manpower allocations to deal with this
problem.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Government  Pledges Help for U.N. Probe Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
Wednesday made a promise to U.N. special envoy Sevan Benom that his
government would "fully support" the U.N. search-and-rescue mission for the
two crashed planes and possible survivors.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos said that it is the duty of the Angolan government to help
the U.N. investigation team to search for the crashed planes and rescue
those possible survivors.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with the Angolan president, Benom told reporters that
dos Santos believed that the two U.N.-chartered planes which went down in
central Huambo Province had apparently been shot down by the troops of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Benom said that his talks with the Angolan president were "very
successful." And he expressed his satisfaction with the promise made by
dos Santos that the Angolan government will ensure the safety of all U.N.
humanitarian relief workers and all members of the non-governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. special envoy denied the claim that the U.N. has
stopped its humanitarian flights in Angola by saying that the world body "
would not use humanitarian assistance as a political weapon and would not
allow anyone do so."
</P>
<P>
As U.N. Undersecretary-General for Defense and Security, Benom Wednesday
also held discussions with Angolan Defense Minister Pedro Sebastiao on the
details of sending a probe team.
</P>
<P>
Authorized by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Benom arrived in Angola
Monday to investigate the causes for the consecutive crashes of the two U.N.
 planes.
</P>
<P>
On December 26, one C-130 transport plane went down soon after it took
off from the Huambo airport. Just eight days later, another U.N. plane
crashed in a near site. There were altogether 22 U.N. workers and crew
members.
</P>
<P>
Because fierce fighting is still going on between the Angolan government
troops and the UNITA forces near the crash sites, the U.N. has appealed to
the two warring sides to agree to a 48-hour cease-fire so that the search-
and-rescue mission can be implemented.

<HEADLINE> U.N., Angola Agree to Set Up Search Team Over Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and
the Angolan Government agree to set up a search team to conduct
search and rescue at the crash sites in central Angola, U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Under-Secretary-General and Security Coordinator Benon
Sevan told the U.N. headquarters here in New York that the
agreement came after he met with Angolan President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos Wednesday morning in the Angolan capital of Luanda,
when the two sides discussed cooperation and access to the crash
sites.
</P>
<P>
"Sevan said that he and the president agreed to set up a search
team and that the president said he was ready to assist in the
deployment of such a team," the U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent Sevan to Angola to
facilitate rescue operations for the two U.N.-chartered planes and
assess the threat to the security of U.N. personnel in Angola. But
he has so far failed to secure a cease-fire between government
troops and rebel UNITA, the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, that would allow a full search for
survivors.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman made the announcement as the Security
Council is meeting behind closed doors on the latest developments
in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Since the downing of the planes, the United Nations has halted
all flights in and out of Angola and withdraw its staff from
combat areas.
</P>
<P>
The first U.N. aircraft, a leased C-130 cargo plane, went down
on December 26 with 14 passengers and crew aboard. A second C-130
was shot down Saturday soon after taking off from Huambo, about
500 kilometers southeast of Luanda, with five passengers and four
crew members.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Says Japanese FM's Mideast Tour at Critical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese foreign minister's
upcoming visit to the Middle East comes "at a critical moment"
when the Mideast peace process comes to a standstill, a senior
Egyptian official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo "plays an influential role" at both regional and
international levels, said Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister
Nagui Ghatrrify.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura is scheduled to arrive
here Wednesday night on a three-day visit. Egypt is the first stop
of his regional tour, which will also take him to Lebanon, Syria,
Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have come to a halt due to
Israel's decision to hold early elections on May 17.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between Syria and Lebanon, on the one hand,
and Israel, on the other, have been in a deadlock since early 1996
due to disputes over the future of the Syrian territory captured
by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War.

UNITED NATIONS, January 6 (Xinhua) --U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said on Wednesday that he has no convincing evidence on
U.N. arms inspectors' spying on Iraq for the United States as the
Washington Post had reported.

"We not only have no convincing evidence of these allegations;
we have no evidence of any kind. We have only rumours," the U.N.
chief said in a statement issued by his spokesman's office.

Fred Eckhard, U.N. spokesman for the Secretary-General, said at
the noon brief that Annan had spoken to Butler about the
allegations and "Ambassador butler categorically denied them."

<HEADLINE> Butler Says UNSCOM Spies For No Nation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler said on Wednesday that the United Nations
Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction spied for no nation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Butler, Executive Chairman of UNSCOM,
said "We have never conducted spying for anybody."
</P>
<P>
Butler was responding to the report in Washington Post that
says U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan had obtained convincing
evidence that UNSCOM had helped the United States listen to some
of Iraq's most sensitive communications.
</P>
<P>
"Have we facilitated spying? Are we spies? Absolutely not.
Don't believe everything that yor read in print. There is much in
those articles which is wrong. I regret it," Butler said.
</P>
<P>
Butler said UNSCOM obtains assistance from more than 40 U.N.
member states to carry out its mandate, including the United
States, which were obliged by U.N. resolutions to provide that
help.
</P>
<P>
He said " We have never accepted or used any of that
assistance for any other purpose, not for any member state's
purpose, only for our purposes of seeking to bring about the
disarmament of Iraq."

<HEADLINE> Russia Slams Warsaw for Granting Asylum to Russian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Wednesday criticized
Poland for granting refugee status to a former Russian politician
wanted at home for bribery charges.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry said there was no legal
justification for giving asylum to Sergei Stankevich, a prominent
figure during perestroika who is accused of taking 10,000 U.S.
dollars in bribes, a charge Stankevich denied as a political
frame-up.
</P>
<P>
"Attempts by certain circles in Poland to give a political
coloration to what is a criminal case and the absence of any legal
justification for this decision by the Polish government is reason
for serious doubts about its readiness for honest cooperation
between the law enforcement agencies of the two countries," the
ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Such actions in Poland can give rise to nothing but regret and
are certainly out of tune with statements by Polish officials
about their desire to develop good-neighbor relations between our
countries."
</P>
<P>
The ministry said Stankevich did not qualify for refugee status
under any of the criteria listed in the international accords to
which both countries are signatories.
</P>
<P>
Under a convention of July 28, 1951, and a protocol of January
31, 1967, a nation may grant refugee status to a foreign national
who has valid fears of racial, religious, national, social or
political persecution at home. None of this applies to
Stankevich, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Questions are warranted about the legitimacy of the Polish
government's decision to grant refugee status to Sergei
Stankevich," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Order Maize as Famine Looming in Northeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has decided to
purchase 270 million kilograms of maize as a drought-related famine is
threatening northeastern areas of the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural Minister Musalia Mudavadi told a press conference Wednesday
that Kenya harvested a bumper 2.34 billion kg of maize last year but the
poor rainfall in the October-December "short rains'' season caused crop
failures and famine in northeastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"Crops in many parts of the country, which rely on the short rains for
food production, are showing signs of moisture stress," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is expected that for most of the areas there will be a total crop
failure,'' Mudavadi added.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will closely monitor maize supply levels in the
areas hardest hit by crop failures.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's yearly maize consumption is around 2.88 billion kg and the
government is expecting supplies of 3.4 billion kg from 1998's bumper crop
as well as imports, leading to a surplus of 504 million kg by June 1999,
said Mudavadi.
</P>
<P>
But the failure of the short rains meant there would now be no surplus,
said the agricultural minister.

<HEADLINE> 106th U.S. Congress Convenes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The 106th Congress of the
United States opened on Wednesday with Representative Dennis
Hastert elected new House speaker to succeed Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
At the stroke of noon the House was called to order to start a
session in which the Republican hold on power is one of the
narrowest in history. The Senate session officially began minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
The House vote was 220-205, with Democrats voting for their
leader, Representative Dick Gephardt of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
Hastert, 57, who has emphasized the need to end the partisan
rancor that has characterized Congress in recent years, promised
more bipartisan spirit in his remarks as speaker. In a gesture to
the Democrats, he allowed Gephardt to preside from the speaker's
chair while he gave his speech, which he delivered from the well
of the House.
</P>
<P>
"Solutions to problems cannot be found in a pool of
bitterness," Hastert said. "In the turbulent days behind us,
debate on the merits often gave way to personal attacks."
</P>
<P>
Hastert outlined four areas that Republicans hope to promote in
the coming session: Social Security and Medicare reform, more
local control of education, lower taxes and stronger national
defense.
</P>
<P>
In response Gephardt said Democrats will do their part to end
the partisan conflicts of recent years. "Let's bury the hatchet,"
he said as he introduced Hastert, and "put to rest finally the
poisonous politics that has infected this place."
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Al Gore, presiding over the opening of the
Senate, swore in the 34 senators elected or re-elected in 1998.
There are eight new senators, four from each party.
</P>
<P>
A different sort of swearing-in ceremony will take place
Thursday in the Senate when Chief Justice William Rehnquist
administers the oath to the 100 senators, who will serve as jurors
in the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Hastert's surprise rise to the leadership spot followed
Gingrich's decision to resign in the wake of Republican losses in
the November elections last year and the announcement last month
by Gingrich's expected successor, Bob Livingston, a Republican
lawmaker, that he had had extramarital affairs and would not seek
the speakership.
</P>
<P>
The House completed its part in Clinton's impeachment matter
when it approved two articles of impeachment last month. But it
must reappoint the 13 Republican Judiciary Committee members who
will act as prosecutors in the Senate trial on whether to remove
the president from office.
</P>
<P>
The House, as in most years, will go into recess after the
opening session, waiting until after the president's State of the
Union address, scheduled for January 19, before getting down to
real business.
</P>
<P>
The Senate will start Thursday to undertake the impeachment
trial proceedings against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still unclear when the formal trial would start
and how long it would last.
</P>
<P>
The House in December last year passed on largely party-line
votes two articles of impeachment against Clinton alleging he
committed perjury and obstructed justice in trying to cover up his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
The votes sent the issue to the Senate, where a two-thirds
majority must vote to convict Clinton in order to remove him from
office.

MOSCOW, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian First Deputy Prime

criticized."
</P>
<P>
Maslyukov said at a meeting with senior officials of the State

<HEADLINE> Decision on Namibian Secessionists Soon in Botswana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A Botswanan government spokesman
said Wednesday that more than 2,000 Namibians who fled to Botswana to seek
political asylum will know their fate within days, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"The committee which is interviewing the asylum seekers is expected to
finish its work within three or four days," SAPA quoted the unnamed
spokesman as saying. "A government decision is expected soon after."
</P>
<P>
The Namibian government alleged that the asylum seekers were linked to
a group seeking the secession of the Caprivi strip from Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the secessionist group were among the first to cross the
border on October 30 last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the refugees are unlikely to be sent home against their will
as both Botswana and Namibia are signatories to a convention on asylum
seekers of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
A November meeting in Botswanan capital Gaborone between Namibian Prime
Minister Hage Geingob and Botswanan Deputy President Ian Khama agreed that
the secessionists would only be returned to Namibia voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR advised the Botswanan government in determining the status of
the Namibians. In mid-November, the UNHCR found it was plausible they
would face persecution if they went back.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary UNHCR report concluded that the Namibians did not plan
to use Botswana as a base from which to pursue an armed struggle for the
independence of Caprivi.
</P>
<P>
They were, however, considered keen to continue political activities to
settle the issue through peaceful negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Economy Not Needs Devaluation, Says PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish outgoing Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz said here Wednesday the Turkish economy does
not need a devaluation, adding that devaluation won't bring any
benefit to the economy.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to reporters titled "Turkish Economy at the
Beginning of 1999", Yilmaz said "in Turkey, investors and
industrialists can't carry the burden of high interests
anymore. It is the biggest hurdle that stands in front of the
struggle against inflation rate."
</P>
<P>
He said that although interest rates fell by 30 percent,
following the sudden eruption of the government crisis, interest
rates soared again to 150 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government led by Yilmaz collapsed in November
in a no-confidence vote as a result of his corruption
scandals.
</P>
<P>
On the Turkish economy, Yilmaz stressed: "in 1999, interest
rates will continue to fall, In addition, Central Bank foreign
currency reserves will start rising again."
</P>
<P>
Turkey's State Statistics Institute has announced that the
consumer products prices increased 2.5 percent in December
compared to that of November 1998. Thus, the inflation rates
of 1998 were 69.7 percent, higher than the government's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
By signing the Staff Monitoring Program with the
International Monetary Funds (IMF), Yilmaz said his minority
government won the confidence of both domestic and foreign
investors so that Turkey borrowed 2.7 billion U.S. dollars from
abroad in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said that Turkey was granted 600 million dollars for
long term education funding, 369 million dollars for earthquake
and flood relief and 270 million for energy transmission lines
by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
On the Turkish foreign trade, Yilmaz said that while the
rate of export growth has fallen, imports has also fallen as
a result of domestic contraction.
</P>
<P>
"In the period between January and October 1998, exports to
Asian countries fell by 46.2 percent and exports to Russia
dropped 31.8 percent."
</P>
<P>
Russia is the second largest trade partner in the world
and the trade volume between Anakra and Moscow reached near 10
billion U.S. dollars in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Greece Continues to Commit to Cyprus Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Greek Ambassador to Cyprus
Kyriakos Rodousakis stressed here Wednesday that Greece will
continue to be committed to defending Cyprus in the event of a
fresh Turkish offensive.
</P>
<P>
Rodousakis made the remarks in an interview with the Cyprus
Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Rodousakis reiterated Greece's unwavering support for Cyprus,
saying "our weapons purchases take Cyprus into account and I
wonder why Greece's intent to defend Cyprus is being questioned."
</P>
<P>
Greece and the Greek Cypriot-dominated Cypriot government
signed a joint defense pact in 1993, which provides that Athens
will come to Cyprus' assistance if it is attacked.
</P>
<P>
Rodousakis said "Greece and Cyprus are working together to make
the best use of all the possibilities and recent developments
related to the Cyprus problem and the reduction of tension and
military equipment."
</P>
<P>
He also said, "it would be naive for Greece not to adjust its
plan throughout the Aegean and the wider region, but we could not
abandon the joint defense pact."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus ordered S-300 anti-aircraft missiles from Russia in 1997
to increase its defense capability and the missiles had been
originally scheduled to be shipped to Cyprus by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
But Turkey, the close ally of Turkish Cypriots, who
unilaterally declared an independent republic in northern Cyprus
in 1983, had since vowed to launch pre-emptive strikes if the
missiles were deployed on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
President Glafcos Clerides made a last minute decision on
December 29, 1998 to cancel the deployment after consultation with
Athens.
</P>
<P>
The decision has come under strong criticism both in Cyprus and
in Greece and two ministers of Cyprus' Socialist EDEK party
resigned.
</P>
<P>
Rodousakis also said he believes that there is "sincere
disposition" on the part of various circles to fulfill their
commitment to work for a reduction of military equipment in Cyprus
and an overall settlement of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island, but
the peace talks between the two sides have been stalled since
summer in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find Way to Make Cancer Cell Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- British scientists have found a
ground breaking way of making cancer cells commit suicide that
could lead to a new generation of drugs to combat breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, led by Professor Robert Newbold of Brunel
University, made the discovery by "winding up" the clock which
tells cancer cells when it's time to die, the British Cancer
Research Campaign, which funded the study, said Wednesday in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Normally, old or damaged cells send a chemical message to
stop dividing and self-destruct to prevent any mutations being
duplicated and growing into tumors.
</P>
<P>
Cancer cells usually ignore these messages and continue to
multiply indefinitely and out of control.
</P>
<P>
An enzyme called telomerase is one of the factors responsible
for protecting cancer cells from the natural aging process.
</P>
<P>
Professor Newbold and his team have found that a group of genes
could halt the production of the enzyme telomerase, which prevents
cancer cells from dying.
</P>
<P>
"We already know that telomerase is active in around 85 per
cent of cancers and is probably responsible for kick-starting the
process that protects cancer cells from dying." Professor Newbold
said.
</P>
<P>
"However, our latest research has finally been able to pinpoint
a new way to potentially de-activate this rogue enzyme." he added.
</P>
<P>
In lab tests, groups of healthy genes were transferred into
breast tumor tissue to ascertain which which combination could
potentially stop the gene that produces telomerase from working.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have successfully identified "chromosome 3" as
the specific group of genes which has the ability to stop the
further production of telomerase in breast tumours.
</P>
<P>
In addition, by using advanced genetic techniques they have
also been able to map the gene responsible to a small region of
the chromosome.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of a normal copy of chromosome 3 into these
breast cancer cells will cause them to regain their normal aging
process and die." Professor Newbold said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Reduces Oil Prices Under Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ABUJIA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Yielding to pressure from labor unions,
the Nigerian government has pedalled back on the new increased prices of
petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
 A statement issued Wednesday here by the Association of Petroleum
Marketers said the new price for gasoline now is 20 Naira (one U.S. Dollar
equals 86 Naira) per liter, compared with 25 Naira announced earlier.
</P>
<P>
The new price for diesel is 19 Naira per liter, compared with 23 Naira
before, while the price of kerosene has been reduced from 23 Naira to 17
Naira per liter.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement signed by the association's president Umar
Abba Gana, the new prices were agreed at a meeting between marketers and
Aret Adams, the special adviser on petroleum to Nigerian Head of State
General Abdulsalam Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's petroleum marketers raised the prices of their commodities on
December 21 without a formal announcement.
</P>
<P>
Before the hike, gasoline was sold for 11 Naira per liter, while diesel
was sold for nine Naira per liter.
</P>
<P>
The marketers' move was apparently approved by the government, as
senior officials have repeatedly said that increased price would help
combat against the smuggling of petroleum products to neighboring countries
where the commodities are much more expensive.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, the top crude oil producer in Africa, has been suffering from
prolonged oil scarcity in the last two years, which even got worse in the
just-concluded 1998.
</P>
<P>
Besides smuggling, black market sales and ailing refineries have also
been blamed for the ironic situation.
</P>
<P>
The price hike, however, has been strongly criticized by the labor
union.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Labor Congress Tuesday issued a 14-day ultimatum demanding
the government review the price hike.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Lashes out at Rebel Penetration in  Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday issued a presidential statement, voicing its "strong
support" for the elected president of Sierra Leone and strong
condemnation of rebel penetration into Freetown, capital of the
West African nation.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the
15-member Security Council for the month of January, Celso Amorim
of Brazil, said, "Council members reiterate the strong support for
the democratically elected president of Sierra Leone, President
(Ahmed) Kabbah, as well as the efforts that are being conducted by
ECOWAS," the Economic Community of West African States, and its
peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Security Council called on the international
community to support ECOWAS, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Council members strongly condemned the penetration of rebel
force in Freetown, and also condemned the support for the rebels
from abroad," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council expressed support for all diplomatic
efforts and particularly those in the region to restore peace and
security in Sierra Leone," the statement said, which voiced the
appreciation of the work of the U.N. Observer Mission in Sierra
Leone (UNOMSIL).
</P>
<P>
The statement came at the end of the closed-door Security
Council consultations on Sierra Leone on Wednesday morning as
rebels are reported to have seized President Kabbah's State House
in central Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told a press conference
that at the time of attack in Sierra Leone, the United Nations had
20 international staff members in Freetown -- 17 from UNOMSIL, and
the three U.N. agency staff members.
</P>
<P>
"They are in the process of being relocated from Freetown,
first by helicopters to the airport at Lungi, where they were to
be taken to Conakry by fixed-wing aircraft," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In light of these developments, the Secretary-General's
special report to the Security Council, which was due tomorrow,
may be delayed by one day," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
United Nations personnel, including military observers, pulled
out en masse from Sierra Leone's rebel-besieged capital. They were
seen boarding aircraft and helicopters at Lungi International
Airport, which is across an estuary from Freetown, before their
departure for Conakry, capital of Guinea, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Lashes out at Rebel Penetration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday issued a presidential statement, voicing its "strong
support" for the elected president of Sierra Leone and strong
condemnation of rebel penetration into Freetown, capital of the
West African nation.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the
15-member Security Council for the month of January, Celso Amorim
of Brazil, said, "Council members reiterate the strong support for
the democratically elected president of Sierra Leone, President
(Ahmed) Kabbah, as well as the efforts that are being conducted by
ECOWAS," the Economic Community of West African States, and its
peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Security Council called on the international
community to support ECOWAS, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Council members strongly condemned the penetration of rebel
force in Freetown, and also condemned the support for the rebels
from abroad," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council expressed support for all diplomatic
efforts and particularly those in the region to restore peace and
security in Sierra Leone," said the statement, which voiced the
appreciation of the work of the U.N. Observer Mission in Sierra
Leone (UNOMSIL).
</P>
<P>
The statement came at the end of the closed-door Security
Council consultations on Sierra Leone on Wednesday morning as
rebels are reported to have seized President Kabbah's State House
in central Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told a press conference
that at the time of attack in Sierra Leone, the United Nations had
20 international staff members in Freetown -- 17 from UNOMSIL, and
the three U.N. agency staff members.
</P>
<P>
"They are in the process of being relocated from Freetown,
first by helicopters to the airport at Lungi, where they were to
be taken to Conakry by fixed-wing aircraft," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In light of these developments, the Secretary-General's
special report to the Security Council, which was due tomorrow,
may be delayed by one day," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
United Nations personnel, including military observers, pulled
out en masse from Sierra Leone's rebel-besieged capital. .

UNOMSIL was established on July 13, 1998, under a Security
Council resolution to monitor the military and security
situation in the country.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lanka Set to Give Grand Commemoration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has prepared a series
of activities for a grand commemoration of the centenary birth of
legendary Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike, late prime
minister and founder of the ruling Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
A commemoration committee headed by Minister of Provincial
Councils and Local Government Alavi Moulana is the organizer of
the commemoration activities for the late prime minister's
centenary birth, which falls on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The commemoration ceremony will officially begin with a floral
tribute to the Bandaranaike statue at Galle Face, Colombo, at
10:00 a.m. Friday. Government ministers and members of Parliament
and foreign diplomats will grace the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Bandaranaike, who served as prime minister from April 1956 to
September 1959, was born in a powerful patrician family in 1899.
But he revolted against the values and way of life of the
patrician class which his father represented.
</P>
<P>
Bandaranaike, on his return from Oxford in his mid-20s, changed
his religion to Buddhism, donned the national clothes, founded the
Sri Lanka Freedom Party and rode the Sinhala Buddhist force to
power.
</P>
<P>
Having sensed the seismic changes which were taking place in
colonial Ceylon, renamed as Sri Lanka in 1972, in the 1930s and
1940s, he knew that the old order had to give place to the new.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka hopes the political life of the late leader becomes
known all over the world as the commemoration activities go on
web. A web page depicting the political life of Bandaranaike will
be launched Friday at the Institute of Computer Technology.
</P>
<P>
Two commemorative stamps in honor of the late leader will also
be issued by the Postal Department Friday.
</P>
<P>
The major commemorative activities will be held on Saturday at
the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall, with a
special memorial lecture delivered by Meghanath Jagadeeschandra
Desai Sami, director of the Center for Study of Global Governance
at the London School of Economics.
</P>
<P>
The high point of controversy of the Bandaranaike period was
his decision to make Sinhala the official language amidst the
opposition of the Federal Party.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that in hindsight it would appear that much
of the later problems between majority Sinhalese and ethnic Tamils
could have been avoided if the formula of making both Sinhala and
Tamil the official languages had been accepted.
</P>
<P>
But there is reason to believe that Bandaranaike genuinely felt
that Sinhala as the language of the vast masses had to come into
its own as a form of self-expression of those people if they were
to truly assert their identify.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, hard-core
of the ruling People's Alliance, will seek to project its
founder's personality and politics during his anniversary and try
to get whatever advantage from such an exercise, as the
presidential election scheduled for March and the provincial
elections for August this year are coming near.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Invites D-8 Member Countries to Attend Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has sent invitations to
the heads of government and state of the member countries of the
Developing Eight (D-8) to attend the second summit of the grouping
slated for early March this year, the official BSS news agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
All countries had consented to attend the summit, the first
largest gathering of international leaders in the capital city of
Dhaka, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Seyed Mohammad Khatami had confirmed his
attendance to the summit, to be preceded by a meeting of the
council of ministers, it added.
</P>
<P>
The D-8 came into being in June 1997 after leaders of
Bangladesh, Egypt, Iran, Indonesia, Pakistan, Malaysia, Nigeria
and Turkey, eight Muslim-majority countries, met in Istanbul,
Turkey, for greater trade and economic relations among the eight
countries.
</P>
<P>
The summit, originally scheduled for November 28-29 last year,
was postponed to March 1-2 this year due to the devastating floods
that hit the host country between July and September.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative trade turnover of the eight countries with a
total population of about 800 million was around 400 billion U.S.
dollars, but trade among them is less than 10 percent of their
total trade, the BSS said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- The volume of private foreign investment in Morocco
from 1991 to 1998 is estimated at 4.5 billion to 5 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The investment mainly went to such areas as tourism, banking,
industry, petroleum, energy, trade and real estate.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, Morocco attracted 700 million to 800
million dollars of investment every year, the Arab daily "Al Hayat"
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Morocco ranks the fourth, after South Africa, Egypt and Turkey,
in attracting investors to Africa and the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The gross domestic product of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) in 1998 reached 170 billion dirhams (46.3 billion
U.S. dollars), down 5.5 percent from that of last year which stood
at 180 billion dirhams (49 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The decline was attributed to a drop of 27 percent in oil
prices. About 60 percent of government revenues come from oil
sale, the Egyptian daily "Alam Al Yom" quoted the UAE Minister of
Planning Hameed Bin Ahmed as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
MUSCAT -- Oman is expected to witness a budget deficit of 219.4
million Omani rials (570 million U.S. dollars) in 1998 due to a
big slump in oil prices in world markets.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Omani Ministry of Finance show the budget
deficit increased by 189 million rials (491.4 million dollars)
in the first 10 months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Oil revenues declined by 26 percent in the first ten months of
1998, reaching 1,038 million rials (2,696 million dollars), as
compared to 3,660 million dollars in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel saw a budget deficit of 2.2 billion
U.S. dollars, or 2.4 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP)
in 1998, statistics from the Finance Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign currency deposits held in local banks by foreign
residents in Israel rose to a new all time high of 15.9 billion
U.S. dollars in last November, the Bank of Israel said.

<HEADLINE> IRA Reaffirms Peace Commitment in New Year Message </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA)
Thursday reaffirmed its commitment to Northern Ireland's peace
process, and urged pro-British unionists to implement the peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
In a New Year message which was published in the IRA's weekly
newspaper An Phoblacht, the IRA accused Britain and its unionist
supporters of forcing an end to its first cease-fire in February
1996, when it set off a huge bomb in east London's Docklands
office and residential area, killing two people and causing
considerable property damage.
</P>
<P>
"We approach the New Year optimistic and confident of the
ultimate achievement of our republican objectives, a united and
independent Ireland," said the IRA.
</P>
<P>
"We reaffirm our commitment to the establishment of a just and
durable peace in Ireland," it said.
</P>
<P>
"We approach the New Year conscious therefore of the growing
frustration at the failure thus far of the Belfast Agreement to
deliver meaningful change," the IRA added.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the deal, signed by Protestant and
Catholic parties in April, has become mired in controversy over
whether the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein should start taking
seats in a Northern Irish executive before the IRA has started
handing in its weapons.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has repeatedly ruled out an early start to
decommissioning of its arms but not ruled it out completely.

<HEADLINE> UAE Banks Report Smooth Euro Induction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Banks in the United Arab
Emirates have reported a smooth induction of Europe's new
currency, the euro, but bankers said it is too early to
assess its possible impact on various industries in the country.
</P>
<P>
Though the European single currency was given a warm welcome,
the dealings in euro were reportedly thin at the end of the third
official trading day Wednesday in the UAE, bankers disclosed.
</P>
<P>
They added they were still mainly dealing in German marks,
French francs and some of the other European currencies, the Gulf
News daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The euro were officially launched on January 1. While the euro
will not be in consumers' pockets until 2002, it now can be used
for non-cash, credit card or traveler check purchases.
</P>
<P>
The 11 nations adopting the euro are Austria, Belgium, Germany,
Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal
and Spain.
</P>
<P>
The bankers said they were watching keenly the movement of the
euro to see whether it is gaining strength or weakening against
major international currencies.
</P>
<P>
It will take at least two or three months to feel the real
impact of the single currency and it will be effective only when
dealings in other European currencies stop to compel people to
rush for it, said Hyder Abbas, head of foreign exchange and
treasury of Abu Dahbi-based Bank Paribas.
</P>
<P>
The UAE dirham traded at 4.32 to the euro on Wednesday, a
senior official of the Abu Dhabi-based National Bank said.
</P>
<P>
The good thing about the euro is that it has become a reality
at last, said the official, adding that its economic effects can
be known a few months later.

<P>
NAIROBI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- President Frederic Chiluba of Zambia
Thursday
ended a short visit to the Rwandan capital Kigali where he held discussions
with government officials about ending the five-month old crisis in the
Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba, who arrived in Kigali Thursday morning, held a two-
hour talks with his Rwandan counter-part, Pasteur Bizimungu, and Vice-
President Major General Paul Kagame, Rwanda News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
''It was a very interesting meeting which dealt with many important
issues concerning the restoration of peace in Congo,'' President Pasteur
Bizimungu told reporters.
</P>
<P>
 Chiluba, who is heading the South African Development
Community (SADC), expressed optimism about his endeavor.
</P>
<P>
''As the president of the (SADC) commission on the peace process in
Congo, I have held talks with heads of state, and foreign ministers of
countries concerned. Up to now, the dialogue is promising and is continuing,
"
Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has held discussions with Congolese rebels, but
refused to
comment on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
 A scheduled summit of heads of state of countries involved in the
Congolese
crisis last month was postponed because the time was not appropriate.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba is lobbying for a maximum participation of the leaders
concerned in the meeting re-scheduled to be heldl in Lusaka on January 12-
15.
</P>
<P>
 Chiluba continued his tour in the region to Kampala, where he is
expected to meet Ugandan officials.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Government Orders to Ban Illegal Logging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian government vowed to
crack down and stop the widespread illegal logging to attract the
aids of international donors.
</P>
<P>
In a decree signed by Prime Minister Hun Sen, the government
ordered the concerned ministries and cities as well as the armed
forces to take tough and effective measures to curb illegal
logging.
</P>
<P>
The decree said that the armed forces should cooperate with the
government and ministries concerned to enforce regulations to
prevent the ongoing destruction of the forest and to confiscate
the illegal processing equipment, transportation facilities, wood
and wood products as well as sending the suspects to the court.
</P>
<P>
The rampant illegal logging and timber exporting has caused
internal and external concern and criticism. Cambodia has suffered
from successive natural disasters such as flooding and drought,
for which the massive and uncontrollable deforestation in the
country were largely blamed.
</P>
<P>
Before 1969, the country's forest coverage amounted for 75
percent of the total land area and natural disasters such as
flooding and drought occurred only occasionally, about one every
10 to 15 years. Nowadays the forest coverage has shrunk to less
than 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some environmental groups even warned that Cambodia's forests
will be logged out within three to five years if the government
can not stop the illegal logging.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some international donors and organizations
suspended the aids and support program to Cambodia partly because
of wasteful logging practices.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebels Dismiss Reports of Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Congolese rebels fighting to
overthrow the government of Laurent Desire Kabila have dismissed the
reports by the Catholic Mission News Agency (MISNA) that they killed 500
people at Makobola village in south Kivu.
</P>
<P>
''These reports are false,'' Jonas Padiri, Liaison Officer of the
Congolese rebel Rally for Democracy (RCD), told the Rwanda News Agency
(RNA) on satellite phone late Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
 Talking about an attack by Burundi Hutu rebels from Tanzania and
Burundi which took place on December 31, Padiri said that about 400 Burundi
Hutus of the Front for the Defense of Democracy (FDD) crossed into the
south Kivu attacked the RCD forces.
</P>
<P>
''Reinforcements came from nearby Uvira and beat off the invading force.
Seven Burundi Hutu rebels were killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Two RCD soldiers were killed, while two others were wounded, according
to a
statement by the RCD communication and press department that reached RNA
office.
</P>
<P>
''The Makobola village is not even inhabited by 500 people,'' the RCD
deputy chairman said. ''This is enough evidence that the reported massacre
is not true,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
 While addressing reporters in Goma late Wednesday, the RCD chairman,
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said that investigation will be carried out, and
those responsible will be punished.
</P>
<P>
 This is the second time the MISNA is reporting on alleged massacre by
Congolese rebels. In August, it had reported that the rebels killed 600
civilians at Kasika, a Roman Catholic mission in Uvira.
</P>
<P>
 A team of foreign journalists Thursday is expected to be flown to
south Kivu where the massacre is said to have taken place, to find out
whether the massacre took place or not, Padiri said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Proposes Restraint Regime With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has offered to
discuss a regime of restraint with India in both conventional and
nuclear fields to minimize the risk of accidents and an unfettered
arms race in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Press Trust of India (PTI) here
Thursday, Pakistan High Commissioner to India Ashraf Jehangir Qazi
urged India to have concrete and positive discussions on these
issues with his country in a structured form in accordance with an
agreed agenda.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need to address these issues within the context of
regimes of restraint, both conventional and strategic...within
which an arms race can be avoided and accidents minimized," Qazi
told the PTI.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, nuclear programs of the two neighbors could become
open-ended, Qazi was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad is expected to raise the need to take concrete
confidence-building measures between the two countries in the
nuclear field in the forthcoming talks at the foreign secretary
level scheduled in New Delhi in the first half of February.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani envoy ruled out the roll-back of the nuclear
program in his country, saying that Islamabad has no option but to
develop a deterrent capability to match that in India.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan does not agree to a no-first use nuclear pact with
India as it would in effect restore India's supremacy in the
conventional field, Qazi said.
</P>
<P>
Qazi said that Islamabad was actively considering India's
proposal to allow an increased number of Sikh pilgrims to visit
the shrines in Pakistan from the existing 3,000 per batch twice a
year to 5,000 per batch.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was also contemplating doubling the 200 per group,
twice a year number of Hindu pilgrims wanting to visit religious
places in Punjab and Sinhd.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani envoy said that option of international
arbitration, if necessary, should be kept open by both India and
Pakistan to amicably resolve the Jammu and Kashmir and other
outstanding issues like the Siachen, Sir Greek maritime boundary
disputes and the Tulbul navigation project.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan failed to make any tangible progress on
nearly all long-pending disputes between them during their second
phase of dialogue held in New Delhi last November.
</P>
<P>
Qazi said that international arbitration, which has been
repeatedly turned down by India, should not be seen as third-party
mediation.
</P>
<P>
He contended that accords on Rann of Kutch, southwest India,
and the Indus River waters dispute were achieved through
international arbitration and world banks intervention
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Qazi said that dialogue between the two neighbors has entered a
substantive phase and he expressed his hope that the next round of
talks would see both sides making greater progress.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Japanese LDP Guests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji met
with a Japanese parliamentarian delegation led by Yamazaki Taku,
former chairman of the Political Affairs Investigation Committee
of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), in Beijing this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China (CPC), said that the CPC and the Chinese government have
always attached importance to the development of Sino-Japanese
relations.
</P>
<P>
He reminded the guests that Chinese President Jiang Zemin paid
an historic and successful visit to Japan last December.
</P>
<P>
"In line with using history as a mirror and looking forward to
the future, Jiang and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
reached important consensus and jointly issued a statement which
confirmed the ongoing efforts for the establishment of a
Sino-Japanese friendly and cooperative partnership incorporating
peace and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Zhu's view, the statement is the third important document
in the continuing bilateral relations following the China-Japan
Joint Declaration and China-Japan Peace and Friendship Treaty,
which "set the benchmark and the direction for Sino-Japanese
relations and marked the beginning of a new phase of bilateral
ties."
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that as long as the state leaders and
politicians in both China and Japan strictly observed the
principles and spirit contained in the three documents and
properly handled existing and emerging problems, a healthy and
stable China-Japan relationship can move forward into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
On the relations between the CPC and the LDP, Zhu considered
that the deepening exchanges between the political parties and
politicians in the two countries played an important role in
developing state-to-state relations and enhancing the friendship
of the two peoples, adding that previous experience helped the
two countries to further their exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Yamazaki said that the successful visit paid by Jiang had
pushed forward bilateral relations into a new stage of
development.
</P>
<P>
He considered that the construction of future-oriented
Japan-China relations is "vital for both countries."
</P>
<P>
He praised China's speedy economic growth and China's
contribution to the Asian economy as a whole, adding that Japan
hoped to continue efforts to enhance Japan-China economic
cooperation." Japan intends to play its due part in China's
economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also briefed the guests on China's economic situation.
</P>
<P>
Dai Bingguo, head of International Department of the CPC
Central Committee, held talks with Yamazaki on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yamazaki and the LDP delegation came to China at the
invitation of the CPC.

<HEADLINE> Trading Volume Up 65 Percent in Singapore Bourse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 74 billion shares changed
hands on the Stock Exchange of ingapore (SES) in the tumultuous
year of 1998, a significant improvement over its 45 billion traded
in 1997, local English newspaper The Business Times reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the hike largely to the surge in the
fourth quarter of last year, which pushed SES trading volume up 65
percent for 1998 over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted share trading volume peaked at 27 billion units
in the first quarter of 1998 and then slid to 11 and 13 billion
shares in the second and third quarter respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, cuts in U.S. and domestic interest rates in
the final quarter of 1998, coupled with the return of some
semblance of calm on the regional currency markets by year-end,
boosted total volume to 23 billion counters in the
October-December period.
</P>
<P>
The volume in the last quarter of the year was double that of
the corresponding three months in 1997, the paper emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Volume would have been significantly lower if not for a surge
in activity in the final quarter, the paper noted, underlining the
hike was achieved after the removal of Malaysian Clob shares in
mid-September.
</P>
<P>
The paper also said that besides the rate cuts, another factor
which helped boost volume during the tail-end of the year was the
slew of initial public offers, adding eight of the 20 new issues
for the year came in the September-December period.
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out that the higher trade volume for 1998 did
not translate into a corresponding rise in value of stocks traded
on the bourse.
</P>
<P>
Figures compiled by SES showed that the turnover for the year
was just 98.7 billion Singapore dollars (59.8 billion U.S.
dollars) -- virtually unchanged from 1997.
</P>
<P>
Market watchers believe the continued downward pressure on
interest rates will boost stock market interest, fueling pick-up
in activity this year.
</P>
<P>
But other watchers hold shares will feature in big ups and
downs in the local bourse this year as there is little room for
further interest rate cut and idle funds increase.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that banks and property stocks accounted for a
huge chunk of the Singapore market's capitalization and the
performance of these counters will be key to sustaining interest
in the broader market.

KUALA LUMPUR, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Seven Afghan nationals have
been detained by Malaysian Immigration Authorities at the Bayan
Lepas International Airport in the northern state of Pulau Pinang
on suspicion of using forged Italian passports, an immigration
officer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An Italian national who is suspected to have helped the
Afghans, who were about to board a Singapore airlines flight for
London, in getting the forged Italian passports was also detained,
Penang Immigration Director Md Saad Md Akhir said, according to
the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
He said investigations showed that the seven Afghan nationals
had entered Malaysia on December 7 last year via the Kuala Lumpur
International Airport in Sepang using Afghanistan passports and
they were believed to have collaborated with the Italian national
in getting the forged passports of Italy before leaving for
Singapore on December 8 and re-entering Malaysia via the Johor
Baharu Causeway on December 15 last year.
</P>
<P>
The eight foreigners were being detained under the Passport Act

Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi, head of Likud steering
committee for the upcoming elections, disclosed some of the new
Likud strategies which include sharp criticism of the Labor
Party, Israel Radio reported, without giving further details.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Labor legislator and former prime minister
Shimon Peres declared his support for Labor leader Ehud Barak,
with whom he has different views on many issues.
</P>
<P>
Peres spoke highly about former chief of staff Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, who joined the crowded field of candidacy for
prime minister Wednesday, but said Barak will have a better
chance to oust Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the May
elections.
</P>
<P>
If a second round of voting for prime minister is needed,
Barak and Shahak should join forces in order to advance the peace
process, Peres said after meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
The Labor is wrestling over whether its list for the next
parliament should be decided by a primary election or by the
party's central committee. Some members have threatened to bolt
the party if a primary is not held.
</P>
<P>
The popular former army chief Shahak, who fired his first shot
by a fierce attack on Netanyahu and a call for unity in Israel,
received a cold welcome Thursday by the Israeli media.
</P>
<P>
"Amnon Lipkin-Shahak left many questions without clear
answers...His answers were especially insufficient about the main
question: How his entry into the campaign will resolve the
national troubles he described," an editorial in the local daily
Haaretz said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Anwar Files Appeal in Suit Against Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Former Malaysian deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim Thursday filed a memorandum of appeal
against the High Court's decision striking out his suit against
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and the Malaysian government.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was sacked as deputy prime minister and finance
minister on September 2 last year, filed the appeal which
contained seven grounds through his counsel Karpal Singh at the
Court of Appeal registry here.
</P>
<P>
Anwar had sought a declaration that his dismissal was
unconstitutional and that Mahathir had contravened Article 43 (5)
of the Federal Constitution in removing him and wanted the High
Court to declare his dismissal was null and void and ineffective
and he is still a cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
Justice Mohamed Saari Yusoff in the High Court ruled on
December 23 last year that Anwar's dismissal was in accordance
with the Federal Constitution and did not breach Article 43 (5) as
claimed.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Saari made the ruling after allowing an application by
the attorney-general to strike out Anwar's suit on the ground that
it did not disclose any cause of action, and was vexatious,
trivial and an abuse of the process of court.
</P>
<P>
Among the grounds of Anwar's appeal is that Saari was wrong in
hearing Anwar's application which had been designated lawfully to
be heard by Justice James Foong, especially when the judge had not
given valid reasons for doing so.
</P>
<P>
Anwar claimed that Saari had seriously misdirected himself in
fact and in law when concluding that his case "discloses no
reasonable cause of action and is obviously unsustainable."
</P>
<P>
Anwar said Saari was also wrong in concluding that the
requirements of Article 43 (5) had been satisfied when, clearly,
the position was the reverse.
</P>
<P>
Anwar claimed that striking out his suit had occasioned a
manifest miscarriage of justice and this was further compounded in
that he was being deprived of his livelihood in contravention of
Article 5 (1) of the Federal Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said under the constitution, only the king has the
prerogative to revoke his appointment on Mahathir's advice, as he
did when appointing him as deputy prime minister on the advice of
the prime minister.

MANILA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Thursday ruled out any government take-over of Philippine Airlines
(PAL) as it created a task force to weigh ways of saving the
flag-carrier.
</P>
<P>
"The government will definitely not go into a take-over of
PAL," Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
But since PAL is vital to the economy, Barican said Philippine
President Joseph Estrada has created a cabinet task force to "look
at all ways and means to make PAL viable."
</P>
<P>
Barican said the task force is reviewing all treaties, air
service agreements and other instructions that are discriminatory
against PAL.
</P>
<P>
He said that all efforts to restore PAL back to financial
health would be subject to the approval of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which has placed the airline under its
receivership.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the commission is now in the process of getting
comments and suggestions of PAL's creditors, adding this is
designed to enable PAL to make adjustments in its rehabilitation
plan.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Egypt, PNA to Meet on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) are planning a high-level meeting on the
stalled Middle East peace process, officials of the Jordanian
Foreign Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which is aimed at coordinating positions on the
Arab-Israeli peace process and on the frozen Palestinian-Israeli
Wye River peace accord, will possibly take place around January 20
in Amman, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy head of the PNA Mahamoud Abbas will attend the meeting
with Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah al-Khatib and Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, PNA President Yasser Arafat is expected to
launch intensive political and diplomatic campaigns during his
visits to Germany, Switzerland and the United States to rally
support for his goal of announcing an independent Palestinian
state on May 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The land-for-peace Wye accord was virtually shelved after
Israel demanded the PNA to collect illegal weapons, reduce its
police forces, curb incitements to violence and renounce its
intention to announce Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has rejected the Israeli demands as new conditions
which were not part of the Wye River accord.
</P>
<P>
The PNA hoped to revive a Franco-Egyptian proposal in 1998 for
an international conference to restart the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process, which was virtually frozen after the Israeli
Knesset (parliament) gave its final approval to a bill on early
elections to be held on May 17.
</P>
<P>
The Franco-Egyptian plan, proposed by Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and his French counterpart Jacques Chirac in May 1998,
called for an international meeting "committed to saving peace" in
face of the alleged intransigence of Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> Import of Sensitive Products Up in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The volumes of wool, acrylic
fibres and aluingot imported through bonded warehouse of east
China's Zhanghjiagang reported big increases in the second half
of 1998, "International Trade News" reports.
</P>
<P>
 From August to November last year, the general trade value
of sensitive products including wool, acrylic fibres, aluingot
methyl isocynate and polypropylene topped 9.6 million U.S.
dollars, an increase of 87.1 times the total of the previous
seven months.
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper attributed the eye-catching growth to
preferential treatment enjoyed by China's bonded areas, as
enterprises operating within their boundaries do not need
licenses or registration to bring in sensitive products, which
ordinary businesses outside of the areas are obliged to obtain.
</P>
<P>
 By last July, there were a total of 348 overseas funded
enterprises in Zhangjiagang, with existing, and further
contracted, overseas investment totaling 713 million U.S. dollars
and 1.47 billion U.S. dollars, respectively
</P>
<P>
 However, the increase was also the result of cost cutting
and relatively low tariffs on sensitive products, and China's
efforts in cracking down on smuggling, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Current Account Turns Red Into Black </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's current account
recorded a surplus of 29 billion ringgit (7.631 billion U.S.
dollars) for the first three quarters of 1998 against a deficit of
12.2 billion ringgit (3.21 billion dollars) in the same period a
year earlier, the Statistics Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the 1998 January-September period, a record surplus of
46.7 billion ringgit (12.289 billion dollars) in the merchandise
balance was achieved, underpinned by a greater impact of the
growth in merchandise exports as against merchandise imports, it
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
During the period under review, merchandise exports were 209.3
billion ringgit (55.078 billion dollars), up 36.5 percent from
153.3 billion ringgit (40.342 billion dollars) year-on-year while
merchandise imports increased by 10.7 percent from 146.9 billion
ringgit (38.657 billion dollars) a year earlier to 162.2 billion
ringgit (42.684 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The department said the services account deficit contracted by
8.2 percent year-on-year in the nine months to 14.5 billion
ringgit (3.815 billion dollars), from 15.8 billion ringgit (4.157
billion dollars) recorded in the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The improvement was attributed largely to a 5.9-percent drop in
the net outlay incurred for freight and insurance, which fell to
6.4 billion ringgit (1.684 billion dollars) from 6.8 billion
ringgit (1.789 billion dollars) a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
It was also due to a significant fall of 61.3 percent in the
net payment of other services components, which dropped to 1.2
billion ringgit (315.789 million dollars) from 3.1 billion ringgit
(815.789 million dollars) year on year, it said.
</P>
<P>
The department said net investment income outflows were up by
3.9 percent during the period under review to post a total of 10.7
billion ringgit (2.815 billion dollars) compared to 10.3 billion
ringgit (2.71 billion dollars) in the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The nine-month period registered a positive but reduced net
long-term capital inflow of 3.8 billion ringgit (1 billion
dollars), representing a decline of 72.1 percent over the same
period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The department attributed this decline to a fall of 60.6
percent in private long-term capital inflow.
</P>
<P>
Another factor was the reversal of official long-term capital
to a net outflow of 0.1 billion ringgit (26.315 million dollars)
from a net inflow of 3.8 billion ringgit (1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The period also saw a narrowing of the surpluses traditionally
maintained by the travel and education as well as transportation
components.

inspector general of police with effect from tomorrow, 8th
January, 1999."
</P>
<P>
According to the attorney general, the investigations which
have been carried out so far have not identified the person or
persons responsible for such injuries on Anwar.
</P>
<P>
He said that after further investigation has been fully carried
out, if there is prima facie evidence, he as the public prosecutor
"will not hesitate to consent to the institution of prosecution
against any individual proved to have committed or abetted the
commission of such offense."
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who was sacked as deputy prime minister and finance
minister on September 2 and detained on September 20 last year,
lodged a report on September 27 on the injuries he sustained while
in detention at the police headquarters here. His eyes appeared
swollen when he was brought to court on September 29 to face
several charges.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Gains Nearly One U.S. Cent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar gained
almost one U.S. cent Thursday, trading at levels not seen for more
than a month.
</P>
<P>
Spurred on by commodity price rises and amid talk that U.S.
financier George Soros was actively trading the currency, the
Australian dollar barreled through 63 U.S. cents at one stage, to
peak at 63.18.
</P>
<P>
At the close the Australian dollar was buying 62.9 U.S. cents,
compared with 61.98 late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The local dollar last traded above 63 U.S. cents on December 2
before the pre-Christmas dive in commodity prices hauled it back
closer to 60 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, Soros was buying last night," Mark Glover, manager
of foreign exchange at Bank of America said, citing market rumors.
</P>
<P>
Glover said the currency's rise was likely a delayed reaction
to the recent yen strength and that could figure in why Soros was
buying.
</P>
<P>
Another dealer said she could not confirm whether Soros was the
instigator but a U.S. bank had been doing a great deal of the
business, pushing the currency up to within 0.6310-20 and then
selling it back.
</P>
<P>
Royal Bank Canada senior economist Su-Lin Ong said the gains
could also be attributed to a rally in U.S. Treasury bonds
Wednesday night and a corrective move following several days of
weakness on the local debt market.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was trading at 70.67 Japanese yen from
69.67 on Wednesday's close and it was buying 0.541 euros at the
close.

<HEADLINE> Davenport, Black Support Calls for Korda Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bjorkman on Wednesday called for compulsory bans for players
who test positive to banned substances.
</P>
<P>
At the Hopman Cup on Thursday, Davenport gave Bjorkman's
comments her full support and said the Korda case, with the Czech
not incurring any suspension, had opened a "book of worms".
</P>
<P>
Korda was stripped of the points and prize money he earned at
Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
Davenport said claims he didn't know he had taken an illegal
substance were dubious.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know the specifics of it, but it's a little bit
awkward that he got off," she said.
</P>
<P>
"First of all you should be in control what's going in your
body, I don't think anyone just takes pills without asking what
it is."
</P>
<P>
At the AAPT Australian Men's Hardcourt Championships in
Adelaide of Australia, Zimbabwe's Black also said he was
surprised Korda got off.
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone's a little surprised because you know, it's
pretty clear in the rules, I'm just going by the rules," Black
said after advancing to the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone should be judged the same and for that
substance, I think if you get caught with it, it's a one year
suspension so that's why we are a little surprised."
</P>
<P>
Davenport said the Australian Open champion had clearly
breached the rules and should be punished.
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the drugs," she said. "It says in the book, if
you take it, it's a year off and it seems like in tennis there is
always exceptions made for players.
</P>
<P>
"If they're making this exception, they are opening a book of
worms for everybody that ever tests positive for anything.
</P>
<P>
Martina Hingis declined to make any comment on the matter.

BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's Telecommunications
Bureau announced today that its cellular phone numbers will have

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebels Control Eastern Freetown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LAGOS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Rebel troops in Sierra Lone were believed
to be in control of the eastern part of capital Freetown and the west
African peace keeping force ECOMOG controls the western part of the city,
reports reaching here Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Defense Headquarters (DHQ) said Wednesday night that the
crisis in Sierra Leone would soon be brought to an end as the rebels
reportedly invaded the office of President Tejan Kabbah in the state house..
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian embassy in Sierra Lone was reportedly burned down on
Wednesday as well as the Police Headquarters and the offices of the
Criminal Investigation Department in Freetown, but no comments are
available from Nigerian Defense Headquarters Thursday morning as the
telephone line is also engaged.
</P>
<P>
Acting Director of Defense Information Lt. Col. Sam Tella said
Wednesday that the Nigerian government was aware of the mounting military
attacks on Freetown by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Tella said the DHQ was monitoring the situation in that country with
regards to the strategies of the ECOMOG soldiers engaged in the battle.
</P>
<P>
U.N. workers and international aid workers fled the capital on
Wednesday after the combined force of the rebels of the Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) and ex-junta members launched their attacks on the city.
</P>
<P>
 Rebel commander Sam Bockarie said Wednesday that his troops had taken
over most of Freetown including the presidential State House and the
broadcasting station.
</P>
<P>
However, the claims were denied by the Sierra Leone government and the
Nigerian-led ECOMOG who insisted that their troops remained in authority.
</P>
<P>
Ecomog sources said the peace keepers had pushed the rebel forces back
some distance toward the east, adding President T. Kabbah was taken
Wednesday by helicopter to a military base used by Ecomog near the
international airport and was there Thursday. "The President is well and
safe," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ecevit Again Assigned to Form New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Democratic Left Party
(DSP) leader Bulent Ecevit Thursday said that President Suleyman
Demirel had again authorized him to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, also deputy prime minister of the ousted government
led by Motherland Party (ANAP) Chairman Mesut Yilmaz, made the
announcement after his one-hour-long meeting with Demirel at the
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, who had served as prime minister three times since
1974, returned his mandate to Demirel on December 21 after he
failed to gain enough support in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the decision to again appoint Ecevit to the form
the 56th government one day after the second prime minister
designate, Yalim Erez, returned his duty to the president.
</P>
<P>
Erez, an independent lawmaker and industry and trade minister
entrusted with the task on December 23 after Ecevit failed, gave
up his attempt to form a government Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Two days ago the True Path Party (DYP) leader Tansu Ciller
provided a sudden support for a proposal of a DSP minority
government by Ecevit, making a government under the leadership of
Ecevit possible.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit and Yilmaz had thus called on Erez to return his
mandate, indicating their optimism over the formation of a ANAP-DYP-DSP
coalition to end the month-long government crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government led by Yilmaz, who is now the acting prime
minister, collapsed in November in a no-confidence vote in
parliament because of corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
Demirel did not appoint the leader of the largest party to form
a cabinet as such an appointment will bring the pro-Islamic Virtue
Party (FP) to power, thus infuriating the pro-secular military.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish constitution requires a designated prime minister
to form a government within 45 days.

<HEADLINE> Shamshad's Iran Visit "Highly Successful": Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A recent visit to Iran by
Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad was "highly
successful," Tariq Altaf, Foreign Ministry spokesman, told a
weekly press briefing here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad paid a visit to Iran from January 1 to 3 as the
special envoy of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. During his stay in
Tehran, the Iranian capital, he called on Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami and Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad had detailed discussions in "a frank and cordial
atmosphere" with Iran's First Deputy Foreign Minister Mohsen
Aminzadeh on various bilateral and regional issues, particularly
on the long-running Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
Altaf said Pakistan and Iran have reaffirmed their
determination to promote durable peace and stability in
Afghanistan and will be consulting each other closely to discuss
ways to achieve this objective.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kharrazi and Shamshad shared the view
that given the history of Afghanistan, they would never accept any
government imposed from outside and whatever dispensation emerged
through an indigenous Afghan process should be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
During his call on Kharrazi, Shamshad underscored many linkages
that existed between Pakistan and Iran and emphasized the need for
further enhancing bilateral cooperation in various fields, for
removing minor irritants and for working together to restore peace
and stability in Afghanistan by enabling the Afghan people to move
toward the formation of a broad-based multi-ethnic government.
</P>
<P>
Altaf said Shamshad's visit to Iran was successful also because
the two countries are determined to strengthen their cooperation
in the economic, commercial, technical and cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Ministerial Commission, the Joint Border Committee,
as well as other committees and commissions, will be convened
shortly to expand the bilateral cooperation in these areas, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He also said Iran has reiterated its position on the Kashmir
dispute -- a final settlement in accordance with the relevant U.N.
resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Flight Safety Threatened by Birds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) - Aircraft safety at Beijing's
Capital International Airport is threatened by increasing numbers
of birds crossing or interfering with flight paths, even though
more than three million yuan (about 360,000 U.S. dollars has been
spent on equipment to scare them off, according to a report in
Science Times.
</P>
<P>
Last September, a large flock of swallows crowded airport
runways one particular day and all flights in and out were
suspended for more than two hours, causing massive financial
losses,
</P>
<P>
"A number of modern devices using solar-energy and computers
were bought from the United States last April but are not as
effective as expected as the birds quickly get used to them and
ignore them," said Du Qingren, an official of the airport.
</P>
<P>
According to experts trying to solve the problem the lush
foliage surrounding the airport has provided a healthy breeding
ground for insects which has attracted the birds in vast numbers.
Research has shown that as many as 76 species can be found around
the airport.
</P>
<P>
Aviation experts say a bird weighing over 500 grams can reach
a stress-strike factor of 500 kilograms if it hits a plane. And,
they reveal, birds caused more than 5,000 flight accidents around
the world last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Xinru, a biology professor from Beijing Normal
University, said that it is difficult to completely eliminate
accidents caused by birds but some things can be done to minimize
the threat.
</P>
<P>
Now a map of where the birds are located around the airport
has been drawn up in order to discover their living and flying
patterns in a bid to apply new technology to reduce the risk of
accidents.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice President Meets Japanese Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese vice president Hu
Jintao called on the youth of China and Japan to carry forward
the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship initiated by the older
generation of leaders, and strengthen exchanges and enhance
mutual understandings in order to make new contributions to the
development of bilateral friendship.
</P>
<P>
Hu made these remarks here this afternoon while meeting with a
delegation of young members of Japan's House of Councilors, led
by Kosei Ueno.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the successful state visit to Japan by Chinese
president Jiang Zemin not long ago, Hu said that Jiang's visit
was conducted in the spirit of learning lessons from history and
facing up to the future.
</P>
<P>
During that visit, the two sides reviewed positive and negat
ive experiences in the development of Sino-Japanese relations,
and defined the future direction for the development bilateral
ties, an exchange of profound pragmatic and historic
significance, added Hu.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that past experience, if not forgotten, is a
guide for the future, and the most important element for
bilateral friendship from generation to generation is to have a
correct understanding of history.
</P>
<P>
As long as the two sides adhere to the principles enshrined in
the Sino-Japanese joint statement, the bilateral treaty of peace
and friendship and bilateral joint declaration, and make
concerted efforts, they are bound to bring a sound, steady and
growing Sino-Japanese good-neighborly friendship into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Ueno said that President Jiang's successful state visit to
Japan last year marks a new phase for bilateral ties, and that
young statesmen of various Japanese parties will strengthen
exchanges with China and deepen their understanding of China to
development bilateral friendship.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived here Wednesday for a goodwill visit to
China as guests of the China-Japan Friendship Association.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Leader Urges Efforts to Reduce Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Communist Party chief Le
Kha Phieu Thursday urged all localities to work out concrete plans
to eradicate hunger and reduce poverty in light of their specific
conditions.
</P>
<P>
If hunger and poverty are not eradicated, none of the targets
can be achieved of speeding up economic growth, improving people's
living conditions, maintaining peace and stability and ensuring
the exercise of human rights, Vietnam News Agency quoted Phieu as
saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of poor people in Vietnam fell by 7.5
million in the past six years, Phieu said at a two-day conference
here to launch a national program for hunger eradication, poverty
alleviation and socioeconomic development in mountainous and
remote areas facing special difficulties.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 alone, he said, despite the adverse impact of the
financial crisis in the region, 250,000 households with 1.25
million people were helped to get out of hunger and poverty.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out that about 16 percent of Vietnam's 12.5
million people are still living in poverty, with 90 percent of
them being inhabitants of northern mountainous and central
highland provinces.
</P>
<P>
Eliminating hunger and poverty and narrowing the gap between
the rich and poor is important for maintaining the socialist
orientation of the country's development, Phieu noted.
</P>
<P>
The party leader spelled out policies and means for reducing
the ratio of poor households to 10 percent by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebels Dismiss Reports of Massacre in S. Kivu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NAIROBI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Congolese rebels fighting to oust
the government of Laurent Kabila have dismissed the reports by the Catholic
Mission News Agency (MISNA) that they killed 500 people at Makobola village
in South Kivu, east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
''These reports are false,'' the Congolese Coalition for Democracy (RCD)

Liaison Officer, Commander Jonas Padiri told the Rwanda News Agency (RNA)
on satellite phone late Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
 Padiri talked about an attack by Burundi Hutu rebels from Tanzania and
Burundi which took place on the night of December 31.
</P>
<P>
 ''About 400 Burundi Hutus of the FDD -- Front for the Defense of
Democracy in Burundi -- crossed into the said area and attacked our forces,'
' he told RNA.
</P>
<P>
''Reinforcements came from nearby Uvira had beaten off the invading
force. Seven Burundi Hutu rebels were killed,'' he indicated, adding that
the casualty figure might be much higher because the routed Hutu rebels
managed to carry the wounded and the dead away.
</P>
<P>
 Two rebel soldiers were killed, while two others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
 A statement by the RCD Communication and Press Department that reached
RNA office said there were no civilian casualty.
</P>
<P>
''The Makobola village is not even inhabited by 500 people,'' the RCD
deputy chairman told RNA. ''This is enough evidence that the reported
massacre is not true,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
 According to commander Padiri, Makobola village stretches over two
zones, separated by a river, one belonging to Uvira, the other to Fizi. He
said most of the residents fled in face of the advancing Burundi rebels.
</P>
<P>
While addressing reporters in Goma late Wednesday, the RCD chairman,
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, said investigation will be carried out, and those
responsible will be punished.
</P>
<P>
It had been alleged by MISNA that the killings of civilians most of
whom women and children had been ordered by a Rwandan commander known as ''
Shetani.'' But Rwandan authorities found this claim bizarre, as they have
no troops in that part of South Kivu.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the MISNA is reporting on alleged massacre by
Congolese rebels. In August, it had reported that the rebels killed 600
civilians at Kasika, a Roman Catholic mission in Uvira.
</P>
<P>
A Congolese rebel official who asked not to be named accused the MISNA
of bias, and said it is the mouth-piece of the Kinshasa government.
</P>
<P>
A team of foreign journalists is expected to be flown to South Kivu and
the area where the massacre is said to have taken place Thursday.
</P>
<P>
''They will be able to talk to local residents and find out whether the
massacre took place or not," said Padiri.

<HEADLINE> China Produces 1.2 Billion Tons of Coal in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At present, supply exceeds demand in coal markets both at home
and abroad, and the dwindling demand has seriously affected
China's coal production and exports, according to Zhang Baoming,
director of the State Coal Industry Administration.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the national coal industry conference which opened
here today, the senior official noted that while facing
difficulties, the Chinese government has taken a series of
supporting and encouraging policies to boost the country's coal
production and exports. As a result, China exported 32 million
tons of coal last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the reshaping of the coal industry system
in the first half of last year, China's coal mines have become
more susceptible to economic growth, with their staffs cut
drastically.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 870,000 workers and staff of key
coal mines have been laid off or transferred to other jobs over
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Also, diversified economic operations greatly contributed to
the sound development of coal mines last year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the number of the country's
coal-related diversified operation enterprises had grown to
17,000, employing a total of over 1.8 million people.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Surge Eases on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Share prices surge moderated
on the Singapore Stock Market Thursday after an overnight record
rally on Wall Street and hopes of even further cuts in domestic
interest rate propelled them to shoot up in morning trading.
</P>
<P>
Digesting news of a debt freeze by a Brazilian state
government, the market gave back some of its early gains at the
close, bringing down share prices from its intra-day high of
1,530.46 points.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) closed 52.91 points
higher over Wednesday to end at 1,517.88 points in active trading,
piercing the 1,500-point level for the first time in more than
nine months.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover swelled to 525.44 million units worth
903.51 million Singapore dollars (about 541.51 million U.S.
dollars). Decliners led advancers by 184 to 119 with 117 counters
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
SemCorp was the most favorite stock of the day with a volume
of 20.12 million units traded. ERL was the second most heavily
traded share with a turnover of 16.79 million units. DBS Land was
next with 16.02 million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Creative 50 headed the ascents of the day with a jump of 160
cents to 26.4 Singapore dollars. It was followed by SIA F which
surged 130 cents to 13.5 Singapore dollars. SPH climbed 90 cents
to finish at 18.5 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, YHS was the biggest loser of the day with a
drop of 18 cents to 3.3 Singapore dollars. Venture was next
retreating 15 cents to 6.1 Singapore dollars. HL Fin sank 10 cents
to end at 3.26 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Asian stock markets exploded to life Wednesday after a slow
start to the new year as foreign funds poured in after returning
from their New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
Share prices skyrocketed in morning dealings Thursday with
broad-based buying from institutional and retail investors boosted
by Wall Street's overnight record performance.
</P>
<P>
But the initial buying spree tapered off as investors began
mulling over the impact of the declaration by Brazil's state of
Minas Gerais of a 90-day freeze on debt payments to the federal
government.

<HEADLINE> "Modern Norway - And China" Published in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A book which compares the
differences and similarities between China and Norway on topics
such as legal systems and welfare was published today.
</P>
<P>
The book, "Modern Norway - And China", is based upon a
seminar on modern Norway co-sponsored by the Norwegian Embassy in
China and the Development Research Center of the State Council
(DRCSC) following the Norwegian King's visit to China last year.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-President of DRCSC, Sun Xiaoyu, said at the book's
launch that despite the fact that China and Norway are
geographically far apart and differ greatly in terms of history,
culture and social system, relevant Norwegian experience in
building and developing a welfare state provides valuable points
of reference for China in its shift to a socialist market economy
and the restructuring of its political system.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian ambassador to China, Sverre Johansen, declared
that he regarded the book as a sign of political cooperation
between the two countries, as well as a motivation to promote
political progress and diversity in both countries.
</P>
<P>
China's relations with Norway, one of the first countries in
the West to establish diplomatic ties with China, have enjoyed
new developments since the two heads of states exchanged visits
in recent years.

The delegation arrived here Tuesday evening as guests of the
NPC Foreign Affairs Committee to begin a ten-day study tour of
direct elections of township-level people's deputies in southwest
China's Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Zou said that China treasures the people's congress system at
all levels, including elections at county and township levels,
and that this is a major event in the country's political life.
</P>
<P>
These elections enable the people to become involved in the
country's effort to promote democracy and improve a legal system,
and exercise their rights as masters of the nation, Zou said,
adding that through the delegation's observations in Chongqing
and relating what they have learned when they return home,
Americans will surely have a better understanding of China's
people's congress and election systems.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Jianhui, chairman of the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee,
was also present to greet the guests.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. visitors, who discussed China's grass-roots democracy
with personnel from both the NPC and the Ministry of Civil
Affairs in Beijing, will go to Chongqing tomorrow to observe the
direct township elections of people's deputies.
</P>
<P>
This is the first field study tour by a foreign
non-governmental organization to see firsthand the direct
elections of China's local power organs since the Carter Center's
two previous inspection tours of villagers' committee elections
in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1982 by former U.S. president Jimmy Carter and his
wife, the center has been devoted to observing democracy and

countries.

</P>
<P>
The sources said the estimated value of the narcotic is nearly
1 million rupees (about 15,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The detection was made early Thursday morning when the man got
off an Air Lanka flight with the heroin concealed under his
armpits.
</P>
<P>
Three days ago on Monday, an Afghan national posing as a
Japanese scholar was arrested by Sri Lankan Customs officials at
the Colombo International Airport here.
</P>
<P>
The man arrived on an Air Lanka flight from Trivandram, India,
with 4.5 kilograms of cocaine worth 18 million rupees (265,000
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Both suspects have been handed over to the narcotics bureau of
the Sri Lankan police for further investigation.
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking has been increasing in recent years in Sri
Lanka, which is said to be a key transit point on the global drug
trafficking route. The relevant authorities have tightened
measures to crack down on drug traffickers.

<HEADLINE> Poll not Decided to Compete in 2000 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Claudia Poll
of Costa Rica isn't sure whether she will compete in the 2000
Olympic Games in Sydney, as she said during the two-day
short-course swimming World Cup which ended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I am not sure about the Olympics. It needs too much
preparation," said the women's 200m freestyle winner at the
Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Poll, 26, had completed her university studies in business
administration last December. She is set to enter several legs of
the World Cup short-course series and World Short-course
Championships to be held in Hong Kong in April.
</P>
<P>
"I need to solve some personal problems first before I decide
to go to Olympics," she said.
</P>
<P>
Blessed with height of 1.91m and explosive stroke, Poll
brought her country's first-ever Olympic gold medal in 1996 when
she upset Germany's world record holder Franziska van Almsick in
the 200m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
At a time when most Olympic champions are fading out, Poll
just can not leave the water.
</P>
<P>
"I love swimming. It is entertaining and I still enjoy the fun
in this sport," she said.
</P>
<P>
"After I won the Olympic champion in 1996, I just decided to
go anther year. I made my choice whether to go on year by year. I
and my coach trained for each year's target," she added.
</P>
<P>
"The four-year Olympics is a long term for training, and I
must train hard if I want to swim at the Games. It is much easier
for us to make a one-year program," said Poll, whose training
sessions began at 3:30 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
Poll started swimming at the age of seven, and has been
trained by her coach Franciso Rivas for almost 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"She will show up at the national championships on March 25,"
Rivas said. "Maybe after the nationals she will make her mind to
compete or not in Sydney, and at the latest after she finished
the Pan Pacific Championships in August."
</P>
<P>
"But one thing for sure, I won't leave the water even though I
don't compete anymore," said the Costa Rican heroine.
</P>
<P>
Poll was happy with her results in the women's 400m and 800m
freetyle at the Beijing World Cup meet though she only won two
silver medals.
</P>
<P>
"My swims are not bad and I don't care about the color of
medal," she said. "Nobody challenges me and the real challenge
comes from myself."

<P>
BEIJING, JANUARY 7 - The Chinese side today expressed its
strong resentment about and firm opposition to the
recently-issued U.S. report, which accused China of acquiring US
military technology through its economic and technological
exchanges and cooperation with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao made the remark
at today's regular press conference.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that "The Ad Hoc Committee on China and Technology
Transfer" of the U.S. Congress recently adopted a so-called
"Investigation Report on Technology Transfer to China", accusing
China of acquiring U.S. military technology through its economic
and technological exchanges and cooperation with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this is "groundless" and the purpose is
attempting to damage China's image and undermine the Sino-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the development of Sino-U.S. relations in the
past two decades has proved that the development of friendly and
mutually beneficial relations and cooperation between China and
the United States, including the normal trade contacts and
economic and technological exchanges, is in keeping with the
mutual interests of the two countries and peoples, serves peace,
stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and the world
at large, and also conforms to the trend of the times and the
common aspirations of the people of all countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is also the bipartisan common understanding and consensus
of the general public in the United States," Zhu added.

According to Zhu, obsessed with the cold war mentality, a few
U.S. congressman run counter to the historical trend and
fabricate rumors out of thin air in an attempt to obstruct the
improvement and development of Sino-U.S. relations and they are
doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that there is a favorable opportunity for improving
and developing Sino-U.S. relations and both sides should further
enhance mutual trust and expand cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We hope that the U.S. congressmen will proceed from
the fundamental interests of the people of the two countries and
do more to promote the development of the bilateral relations and
mutually beneficial cooperation, and not to the contrary," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu added that China also hopes that the US government will
take effective measures to remove all obstacles and maintain the
sound and steady development of the Sino-US relations with actual
deeds.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Industry Aims to Grow 10.57 PC in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's industrial sector
targets a 10.57-percent growth and an export earning of between
6.3 billion to 6.5 billion U.S. dollars this year, Vietnam News
Agency (VNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's National Assembly set a growth rate of between 10-11
percent in 1999 for the sector at its session at the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The objectives were agreed upon at an industrial sector's
conference here on January 6 which discussed ways to implement
industrial production tasks of 1999.
</P>
<P>
State-run industrial enterprises under the central government
are poised to increase their production value by 7.59 percent
while those under local governments aim for 7.06 percent. The
private sector will strive for a 6.43-percent growth while the
foreign-invested sector looks to expand by 18.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
The conference worked out four major measures to achieve these
targets.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector will focus on strengthening and expanding
its foothold on domestic and foreign markets, mobilizing more
capital from domestic sources and continuing to draw in foreign
investment.  Vietnam's industrial growth rate in 1998 was 12.1
percent and industrial production value for the whole year
exceeded 150 trillion Vietnamese dong (nearly 11 billion U.S.
dollars) and export earnings stood at 6 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Capital to Ban Use of Fireworks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 7 (Xinhua) -- After receiving many complaints
about dangerous and polluted fireworks and tracer bullets,
authorities of the capital city of Beirut are considering entering
an official ban on the public use of them.
</P>
<P>
"This custom of letting off fireworks and firing tracer
bullets for any occasion, whether it be Christmas, New Year or
Eid, has to be stopped," Abdel Aris, head of Beirut's
municipality, told the Daily Star published on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It's not civilized, it's dangerous and it tarnishes the city's
reputation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The municipality will take immediate action to enforce a decree
from the Ministry of the Interior to control the use of both
firecrackers and tracer bullets, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the municipality cannot ban the sale of
firecrackers, but it can clamp down on their use during
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
On New Year's Eve, the sky over Beirut was lit up with the red
streaks of tracer bullets.
</P>
<P>
Drivers had to wind up their windows against the hail of
burning ballistics and bystanders caught in the cross fire of
whistling fireballs ran for cover.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified woman crossing a street fainted from fright
when a roadside explosive hidden under a tin can went off in
Beirut's southern suburbs, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Beirut municipality's plan came four days after the country's
Shiite Muslim spiritual leader Sayyed Fadlallah issued a religious
edict, outlawing the use of fireworks as "sacrilegious."
</P>
<P>
In the country's third largest city of Sidon, the municipality
banned the sale of noisy firecrackers Monday, after a large number
of residents complained that the noise invoked memories of the
country's 1975-1990 civil war.

<HEADLINE> GCC States Urged to Act to Get Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) countries need to create a conducive environment to attract
direct foreign investment, according to the lastest issue of the
financial periodical Moneyworks.
</P>
<P>
The market-watcher in an analysis urged the GCC countries to
focus on economic liberalization to stimulate inflows of private
capital both by local and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
It noted that foreign investment is a powerful tool to reduce
the vulnerability of the Gulf region to external shocks.
</P>
<P>
So far, investments in the GCC have almost entirely been inward
oriented due to the infrastructure development of domestic
economies.
</P>
<P>
With the phase of infrastructure development almost over, it is
necessary to identify new avenues of productive and efficient
investments, both on domestic and international bases, the
magazine said.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate private capital inflow to the region, relaxation
of direct controls, removal of structural rigidities and
deregulation measures together with reforms in the financial
sector and stabilization policies are suggested in the analysis.

<P>
LAGOS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Rebels in Sierra Leone moved into capital
Freetown Wednesday afternoon, forcing their way into the State House
offices of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, media reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A man calling himself Col. Sessay was quoted as saying that the
combined forces of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and ex-junta
members met no resistance on their way to the capital.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday evening, the whereabouts of Kabbah were unknown. But
witnesses said Kabbah was at a military base near the capital Freetown's
international airport Thursday, and he was flown to the base of the west
African peace-keeping force ECOMOG by helicopter on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A Freetown resident said the rebels had earlier gone to the Pademba
Road and New England prisons, where they released prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Among those detained in the prisons were rebels of the RUF and ousted
junta members, many of whom were sentenced to death on treason charges.
The rebels burned down the Nigerian embassy in Freetown and torched the
police headquarters and offices of the Criminal Investigation Department.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Meets Japanese LDP Guests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian said here today that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
visit to Japan last year, the first ever made by a Chinese head
of state, unveiled a new stage in the good-neighborly relations
between China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and
state councillor, made the remarks while meeting with Yamazaki
Taku, visiting former chairman of the Political Affairs
Investigation Committee of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP), and 11 accompanying LDP parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Chi noted, the two heads of state reached
consensus on establishing a friendly and cooperative partnership
devoted to peace and development, though some Japanese still show
no remorse for Japan's atrocities against China during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
Only if Japan respects historical honesty, and properly
handles the Taiwan issue as well as the Japan-United States
security cooperation issue, Chi stressed, can the development of
long-term and stable friendly ties for peace be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Yamazaki apologized seriously for the disasters the Japanese

<HEADLINE> Former Polluter Home to Wild Ducks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 600 wild ducks have flown
to a big pool in the Capital Iron and Steel Company here, a
former serious polluter, to spend their winter there this year,
according to today's Beijing Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
"We saw some wild ducks come several years ago, but there
were only three or four of them then," said Wu Jianxin, a company
employee, quite happy at seeing the new flock.
</P>
<P>
The company's industrial water recycling pool has now become
the fourth place where wild ducks, which are pollution-sensitive,
can settle in Beijing. The other three are the Kunming, Yuyuantan
and Zhongnanhai lakes.
</P>
<P>
"We now have assigned people to protect the wild ducks and
feed them regularly," said Li Chongtao, manager of the company's
Greening Company, adding that the plant will build a special home
for the ducks in an effort to attract more.
</P>
<P>
The Capital Iron and Steel Company has spent more than 100
million yuan on pollution control annually for four consecutive
years since 1995, and the plant now meets all of the city's
emission standards while seeing a remarkable improvement in air
and water quality.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait PM: Iraqi Regime Still Source of Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Violence and suppression are part of the personal nature of
(Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein," Saad said in an interview with
the Arabic daily Al-Rai Al-A'm.
</P>
<P>
"Saddam's regime is still a source of tension and
instability to its neighbors, the Gulf region, the Arab nation
and the whole world," he added.
</P>
<P>
This is the harshest remarks made against Iraq by a
senior Kuwaiti official since last October, when tension
escalated in the region following Iraq's suspension of
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has been trying not to be involved in any Iraqi
crisis since last February, when it publicly supported military
strikes against Baghdad to end a U.N.-Iraqi standoff over arms
inspections.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Kuwaiti Defense Ministry and the Army have
repeatedly said that Kuwait was "not a part of U.N.-Iraqi
crisis," but holding Saddam responsible for the escalation of
tension and the following U.S.-British air strikes against
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Southwestern Natural Gas Field Benefits Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A major natural gas field in
southwest China produces 14 million cubic meters of natural gas
daily, accounting for a fifth of the nation's total, China
Chemical Industry News reported.
</P>
<P>
The Chuandong natural gas field is located in the eastern part
of Sichuan Province and Chongqing Municipality, and covers an
area of 55,000 square kilometers, according to the paper. The
field is considered a guarantee for the nation's energy supply.
</P>
<P>
To date, the field has 300 gas wells and has turned out a
total of 70 billion cubic meters of natural gas, 87 percent of
which has been obtained in the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
The report said the field serves as backbone for the growth of
the petrochemical and metallurgical industries of the region.
</P>
<P>
The development of the field has prompted the urbanization of
surrounding areas, the report said, and workers drawn to the area
bring new consumption demand to the region.
</P>
<P>
Chengdu and Chongqing, major southwest China cities, are
greatly benefiting from the natural gas field.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, seven out of ten households in
Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province, now use natural gas, and
their annual consumption is 300 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
In the large industrial city of Chongqing, 13 percent of the
energy consumed is natural gas, and 700,000 of the 1.1 million
urban households have natural gas for daily use.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Economy Stable Last Year: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Despite the Asian economic
contagion, the Philippines managed to maintain macroeconomic
stability and prevent a worsening of its economic situation last
year, Secretary of Foreign Affairs Domingo Siazon said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Philippine foreign policy briefing for members of
the diplomatic corps and the media here, Siazon said that from
January to November 1998, the country managed to post a
single-digit inflation rate averaging 9.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
It also improved its fiscal position with 40.96 billion pesos
(1.02 billion U.S. dollars) in reserves and managed to dodge a
recession by posting a 0.8-percent growth in gross national
product.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the Philippine peso also strengthened
further against the U.S. dollar by the yearend, indicating the
relative inherent strength of the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, Siazon said, is proud to have effectively
managed the ill effects of the Asian financial crisis which
"heightened political and social unrest in some countries, while
others wrestled with increasing criminality, unemployment and
massive poverty."

<HEADLINE> Software Imports to Beijing Up in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Imports of computer software to
Beijing totaled 59.33 million US dollars from January to November
last year, 2.4 times that of the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Figures from Customs offices across the country show that
software imports to Beijing have been accounting for more than
half the country's total since 1993. During the first 11 months
of 1998, the city's software imports accounted for 67.4 percent
of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
The rapid increase of the city's software imports reflect the
general trend in China, a result of the introduction of more
advanced foreign technology and equipment, according to today's
Beijing Daily.
</P>
<P>
State-owned and foreign-funded enterprises are the biggest
software importers in Beijing, with 98 percent of all such
products going to these enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Experts explained that these increasing imports are one result
of the rapid development of the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
Most of software imported in 1997 is used for national
defense, scientific research, and energy, and the information and
pharmaceutical industries. But as more telecommunications
facilities were imported last year, the amount of software used
in this field has also increased.
</P>
<P>
Most of the imported software last year was from Finland and
Sweden.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Prime Minister
Tony Blair has slammed the European Union (EU) for not reaching a trade
agreement with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking shortly after his arrival on Wednesday for a three-day
official visit, Blair said he could not believe that there was no way
around the remaining issues.
</P>
<P>
Both South Africa and EU have held many rounds of talks over free trade
issues for years. However, the two sides failed to reach an agreement as
was expected by the end of last year because of disagreement over the use
of trade mark of wine -- "Sherry" and "Port".
</P>
<P>
South Africa insists that it continue exporting wines with trade mark
of "Port" and "Sherry", but the EU rejected the request.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the British government would work with its German
counterpart toward the resolution of the issues that are hampering
conclusion of free trade agreement between South Africa and the EU.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami vowed to sack Intelligence Minister Qorbanali Dorri
Najafabadi after his ministry admitted that its agents were
involved in serial murders of dissidents and intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
"President Khatami underlined that he would dismiss him
(Najafabadi) if he would not resign," local daily Salam on
Thursday quoted informed sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Khatami would take over the Intelligence
Ministry by himself and appoint one of the current deputy
intelligence ministers as acting intelligence minister.
</P>
<P>
The Intelligence Ministry announced on Tuesday night that it
had arrested a few of its own "devious colleagues" for being
involved in the mysterious killings of an opposition leader and
several dissident writers later last year.
</P>
<P>
The admittance shocked the Iranian society. Some print media
have called for the resignation of the conservative minister and
a pro-Khatami political party also urged the government to change
the structure of the country's security and intelligence system.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Iran Nation Party Darius Forouhar and his wife
were stabbed to death at home in November and several dissident
writers were killed in Tehran in December.
</P>
<P>
Some conservatives have previously blamed "foreign enemies" for
the murders.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Gives Equal Access to Telecom Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Thursday launched
an equal access facility for telecommunications companies in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The equal access is for fixed lines telephony services in the
country with full participation of all five fixed line operators
-- Telekom Malaysia, Binariang, Time Telekom, DiGi Telekom and
Celcom, each getting a three-digit prefix equal access code called
"Carrier Selection Code."
</P>
<P>
With the new system, all fixed telephone users will no longer
be restricted to the telephone company that provides their lines
and can choose, at any time, one of the five operators to carry
their national or international calls if they register with the
operators before hand.
</P>
<P>
The services could be selected by simply dialing the
three-digit equal access code before the national or international
direct dialing numbers.
</P>
<P>
The equal access facility incorporates basic telephony network
services, namely voice telephone, facsimile communications and
Centrex services.
</P>
<P>
Under the equal access facility, the companies in the industry
are allowed to offer up to 20 percent discount of the current
regulated price for calls to avoid a price war, Energy,
Communications and Multimedia Minister Leo Moggie told reporters
after the launching.
</P>
<P>
According to Leo, so far, about 4,000 customers have registered
to use the equal access facility which was on trial since last
October 1.
</P>
<P>
Ruling out possible mergers between major local
telecommunications players, Leo said, "It is up to the market. I
have not heard about anything yet."
</P>
<P>
On whether there is a proposal to increase foreign
participation in the industry, Moggie said the government has
already allowed up to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
"For the time being, we think that is very liberal. In fact, if
you compare with other countries, we are one of the most liberal.
We will leave it at that," he added.

<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- By publishing periodicals and
opening a website, China's first AIDS club aims to create a
friendly environment for virus carriers and patients across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The non-governmental organization, established at Ditan
Hospital in Beijing on Wednesday, has accepted eight AIDS
patients and some medical workers as its first members.
</P>
<P>
"'Home of the Red Ribbon,'as the club is called, plans to play
a role as a bridge between AIDS patients and rest of society,
since these patients still have difficulty trying to live a
normal life," Lun Wenhui, a worker at the club, told Xinhua
today.
</P>
<P>
The club will initiate a series of activities, such as holding
lectures and symposiums for patients and publishing magazines,
said Lun at Ditan Hospital, a leading AIDS clinic.
</P>
<P>
China has at least 300,000 people infected by HIV, the AIDS
virus. Beijing, where China's first AIDS case was discovered in
1985, has diagnosed 280 carriers and patients so far, according
to today's Beijing Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
"HIV/AIDS isn't a simple medical problem, but a complicated
social problem for China. Lots of virus carriers and patients
suffer not only from the disease, but also from discrimination
and isolation from the society," Lun said.
</P>
<P>
The club, which plans to accept members from outside Beijing,
will invite legal professionals, journalists and social workers
to join in order to protect the patients' interests and rights,
and provide psychological counseling, he said.
</P>
<P>
A website, also named 'Home of the Red Ribbon,' is under
construction, and will provide the latest information for linking
up with more AIDS patients, Lun said.

<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan police spokesman Ngobi Bob
refuted the report of the arrest of a member of parliament in a telephone
interview with Xinhua Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Monitor daily reported Thursday that Wasswa Lule, an MP and the son
of former President Yusuf Kironde Lule, was arrested Wednesday night for
allegedly saying that President Yoweri Museveni could be a culprit in the
privatization scandals and therefore should be investigated.
</P>
<P>
However, the arrest claim was denied by the police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
 "We just want the MP to make a statement about his utterances
because they can cause bad impression about the president and the
government. Our earlier attempts to contact him were futile. So police
officers went to his home at about 8:00 p.m. and he went to the Criminal
Investigation Department in his own car," Ngobi said.
</P>
<P>
"The statement is long so he was escorted home by police. He is not
arrested as reported by some newspapers," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The report said Lule, when addressing a seminar on January 3, said he
and his father brought President Yoweri Museveni to power. Museveni then
had nothing and now built a palace and a large farm, he added.
</P>
<P>
The First Lady Janet Museveni Wednesday blasted Lule for his comments
which she said were unfortunate.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- China has set growth targets of
20 percent for its electronic industry this year, the Ministry of
the Information Industry has announced.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin Yuanfang, a senior official with the
ministry, the sector's industrial output in 1998 was estimated at
480 billion yuan. He said that increasing the average growth by
20 percent over the next two years will achieve an output of 700
billion yuan by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The electronics industry is expected to be a pillar of the
country's national economy by the end of the century, and to
account for 10 percent of its total industrial output.
</P>
<P>
"At present it is only 6 percent and to achieve the higher
figure the 20 percent growth rate is necessary," said Lin.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry stressed that the Chinese Government will
continue to put much emphasis on infrastructure development and
this will boost the demand for integrated systems and product
marketing.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese minibus manufacturers
are speeding up the development of new products to meet the
country's new pollution control requirements.
</P>
<P>
Beijing adopted stricter automobile exhaust emission standards
on January 1, as all minibuses manufactured in the country in the
past failed to meet these new standards.
</P>
<P>
The capital has decided to eliminate minibus taxis in the year
2000 to control the city's air pollution, and this measure will
take 30,000 minibuses off of Beijing's streets.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that many major cities in China will gradually
adopt the two anti-pollution measures in the near future, said
today's Economic Daily.
</P>
<P>
Domestic manufacturers are considering increasing the
minibuses' engine power and expanding their market share in the
country's rural area.
</P>
<P>
China has nine major minibus manufacturers with a total annual
capacity of 600,000 vehicles, and production is still
increasing.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Grain Output Of 495 Million Tons This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- China's State Information
Center says that the country's grain output is expected to be 495
million tons this year, about the same as for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The amount of land for grain will remain at 110 million
hectares in 1999, with more wheat, soybeans, and rice grown and
corn decreased in response to demand. Cotton output is expected
to be 3.5 million tons, down slightly from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Although some major grain-producing areas suffered from last
summer's catastrophic flooding, grain output in 1998 was
maintained thanks to the good autumn weather.
</P>
<P>
The SIC says that China's agriculture faces difficulties in
1999 because the flooding left an enormous amount of
reconstruction work that needs to be done, and a glut in
agricultural products has meant continued low prices, dampening
farmers' enthusiasm. China will make a greater effort to develop
agriculture and to maintain stability and increase incomes in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Illegal fees have also kept incomes down. Per capita incomes of
 farmers grew by less than one percent in the first three
quarters of 1998. To deal with this, the Chinese government will
implement rural reforms to improve the land contract system and
stop illegal fees. It will further industrialize agriculture and
develop non-agricultural industries in rural areas as well. Per
capita incomes of rural residents are expected to grow by four
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises, which account for a third of the
country's GDP, will absorb four million more laborers in 1999,
and their value-added output will grow by 14 percent, according
to the SIC. The government will try to help township enterprises
to maintain national economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Official Upbeat About GNP Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Philippine government Thursday predicted that the country's gross
national product (GNP) will grow by 3 percent to 3.5 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Diokno, secretary of budget and management, told
reporters that agriculture's strong rebound, the export sector's
impressive performance and the government's construction drive are
major contributors to the GNP growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, under a stimulus package of the International
Monetary Fund, the government was allowed to incur a deficit of
68.4 billion pesos (1.71 billion U.S. dollars), or about 2.2
percent of the GNP, he said.
</P>
<P>
This stimulus package could largely improve the productive
capacity of the economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed gratitude to the congress for responding to
his department's appeal for an early approval of the 1999 national
budget (January 1-December 31).
</P>
<P>
He explained that the timely approval of the budget was crucial
for the implementation of infrastructure projects before the La
Nina weather phenomenon unleashed its fury on the country's
agricultural sector.

<HEADLINE> China Optimistic About Boosting Trade with Netherlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Despite a 3.5 billion U.S.
dollar trade surplus with the Netherlands last year, China is
confident it can boost bilateral trade in 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the "International Trade News", businesses in
Holland have shown considerable interest in the Chinese market
and the government is supporting investments in China with
preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
Queen Beatrix Wilhelmina Armgard is to visit China in the
first half of this year together with a Dutch business delegation,
 the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Another delegation of small and medium Dutch enterprises
will also attend the China Fair for International Investment
Trade, which will be held in east China's coastal city of Xiamen
in September.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is now China's third largest trading
partner in the European Union. China's exports to the Netherlands
reached 4.15 billion U.S. dollars in the first ten months of
1998, a 19 percent increase on the previous year. In the
meantime, its imports dropped 25.3 percent to 660 million
dollars, according to latest customs statistics.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Government Rules Out Arresting KR Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 7 -- The Cambodia government will not
arrest the Khmer Rouge (KR) leaders who defected to the royal
government, including Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, in order to
maintain peace and stability in the country and the region, an
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, Om Yentieng, advisor
to Prime Minister Hun Sen, clarified the government's stance on
the defecting Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will not force the Khmer Rouge members,
who have surrendered to the government, back to the jungle.
</P>
<P>
"They will not be arrested and their safety will be guaranteed.
It is in the interests not only of the country but also of the
region and the whole world," he added.
</P>
<P>
"They have every reason to live in their own land at their
ease," he said. "Cambodia is a country ruled by law, so every
issue should be resolved in accordance with the law."
</P>
<P>
Om Yentieng pointed out that Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea had
made a peaceful trip recently to the capital of Phnom Penh, the
seaside city of Sihanoukville and Angkor Wat in Siem Reap without
meeting any protest. Facts have shown that what the Cambodian
people need most is peace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Khieu Sopheak, spokesman of the Interior Ministry,
also said, "We are not against the trial of the Khmer Rouge
leaders but not at this moment, because it was not easy for
Cambodia to achieve the current situation of peace and stability.
We should not sabotage it."
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the government will not use military force
to arrest the Khmer Rouge leaders who defected to the government.
</P>
<P>
"We need not only justice, but also peace and political
stability which is the most important thing for Cambodia," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
After Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea defected to the government
and received a warm welcome from the government, international and
external pressures have been mounting on the government and Prime
Minister Hun Sen to arrest and try the two top leaders of Khmer
Rouge.
</P>
<P>
Khem Nguon, the Khmer Rouge general who defected to the
government a month ago, warned that Cambodia could return to civil
war if an attempt was made to arrest former senior leaders of
Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea had returned to the former rebel
base of Pailin now under the control of former Khmer Rouge leader
Ieng Sary, who defected to the government in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Writers Say No to Long Novels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 200 novels were published in 1998, and one writer,
Liu Zhenyun, spent eight years creating his two million-word opus.
</P>
<P>
But most of these novels lack readers because of their length,
the Shanghai-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Another famous writer, Su Tong, said he has read only two and
a half novels in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Yu Hua, a promising young writer, claims he has no interest in
reading long novels.
</P>
<P>
The two writers did acknowledge, however, that reading is an
inseparable part of their lives, but that reading long novels
takes too much time and energy, Su said.
</P>
<P>
There are many brilliant short stories in China, said Yu,
whose longest novel is 170,000-character long.
</P>
<P>
Referring to novels of more than one million characters, Yu
said, "Their writers simply make novels for self-reading."
</P>
<P>
However, one survey indicates that writers living in north
China accept longer novels comparatively easily.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Herd Number on Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
HARARE, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's herd number has been on a
decline since the great drought of the early 90s. The total national herd
is estimated at just under five million from seven million prior to the
drought.
</P>
<P>
Chief executive of the Cold Storage Company Lawrence Masanga was quoted
by Thursday's Business Herald weekly as saying that efforts to rebuild the
national herd which was depleted by the 1991-92 drought have been hampered
by high interest rates and the liberalization of the beef industry which
were done without putting in place adequate regulatory measures.
</P>
<P>
He said present rate of interest of 45 percent is not viable for cattle
producers and that this had inhibited expansion for the existing producers
and prevented new entrants into the industry.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time the liberalization of the beef industry has seen a
phenomenal growth in the number of new abattoirs," he said.
</P>
<P>
At present the national slaughter figures are estimated at 450,000 to
500,000, a drop of up to 35 percent.  Before the devastating 1991-92
drought, the country slaughtered around 700,000 head annually for the
domestic and export markets, he said.

WELLINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Beset by polar blizzards,
slow
travel, dwindling food supplies and illness, three men trekking to

the South Pole have abandoned the return leg of their journey to
the
Antarctic coast, Television New Zealand (TVNZ) reported Thursday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The three explorers are New Zealander Peter Hillary and

cover more than 2,800 kilometers, of which some are previously
unexplored.

the

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Inflation Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NAIROBI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's inflation fell to 2.6 percent
year-on-year last month from 3.0 percent in November, 1998 on the back of
tight monetary policy and good food supplies, the Central Bank of Kenya
(CBK) has reported.
</P>
<P>
The CBK, quoted by the East African Standard newspaper Thursday,  said
year-on-year underlying inflation -- which excludes food prices -- fell to
7.7 percent in December from 7.9 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Maurice Kanga, CBK's chief economist, said the inflation rate reflected
tight monetary policy and a decline in food prices in most of the just-
ended year.
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers we are seeing now are as a result of good monetary
policy," Kanga said.
</P>
<P>
 "When you run a tight monetary policy, it takes time to lower
inflation, there is a time lag of six to nine months. we are now seeing
that impact," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Kanga said food supplies had also greatly improved in 1998 after
problems in the previous year and "effects of this are now trickling in and
are manifest in the figures."
</P>
<P>
But he warned that inflation was likely to be on the upturn again
because the effects of lower food prices and tight monetary policy had
already been absorbed by the economy.
</P>
<P>
"We could be looking for worse inflation," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Chief Banker: Banking System Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Dismissing predictions that
non-performing loans (NPL) in the Philippines will hit 15 percent,
chief banking official of the Philippines said Thursday that the
entire banking system will remain stable this year.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel C. Singson, governor of the Central Bank of the
Philippines, quashed doubts that the country's banking system will
experience liquidity problems due to the slump in the real estate
sector.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the real estate sector has the biggest
exposure in terms of loans owed to the banks in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I do not agree to what some people say that the NPL will hit
15 percent by the end of the year," Singson said during a weekly
roundtable discussion.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics from the central bank showed that the NPL
was 11.97 percent as of the end of October 1998.
</P>
<P>
Compared with other countries in the region like Indonesia,
Malaysia, Thailand, and South Korea, the Philippines has much
lower NPL so far, Singson said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Urged to Understand Euro Implications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian International
Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz Thursday stressed the
need for Malaysia to understand the implications of the
newly-launched euro on global trade.
</P>
<P>
The implications of trading in the euro should not be viewed in
the context of Malaysia's trade with Europe only but also with
other countries due to cross implications, Rafidah told reporters
here after presenting her ministry's excellence service awards.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of the euro, beginning this year, has brought
about a new element to the international trade and marketplace,
she said, adding that it would certainly stand side by side with
other major currencies like the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said her ministry will present a comprehensive paper to
the cabinet on the euro that would outline the implications and
ramifications of the new currency and how the Malaysian private
sector could deal with it most effectively.
</P>
<P>
She said the paper would also look into how her ministry could
work together with the private sector to optimize the use of the
euro in trade.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia conducts substantial trade with countries in the
European Union (EU), with its exports to the EU standing at 42.2
billion ringgit (about 11.11 billion U.S. dollars) and its imports
from the EU at 24.7 billion ringgit (6.5 billion dollars) in the
first 11 months of 1998.

<HEADLINE> China Preserving Oldest Bamboo Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's cultural relics
experts recently discovered a way of preserving 2,400-year-old
books written on strips of bamboo, most of which were in danger
of totally decaying.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the Shanghai Museum have frozen and dried some
1,200 bamboo books containing about 35,000 characters inscribed
during the Warring States Period (475-221 B.C.), according to a
report today in the Shanghai-based Liberation Daily.
</P>
<P>
This freeze-dry method helps improve the strength of the slips
, which are from 24.6 to 57.1 centimeters long, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
According to the scholars, the bamboo version of the Book of
Changes is the oldest extant copy of the famous Chinese classic.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they also found some comments on Confucius on
poems, which had not been recorded in any other known ancient
books, the Shanghai-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
This method of preservation could be used in other similar
cases throughout the world, according to municipal authorities
supervising the protection of cultural relics.

<HEADLINE> Accounts Vary Concerning S. Leone Capital after Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rebels claimed that they had captured the presidential state house and
other key areas, which were denied by the government and west african peace
keeping force known as ECOMOG, reports reaching here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
United Nations staff and international aid workers fled the capital
Wednesday after the rebels and breakaway soldiers of Sierra Leone's former
military junta launched their attack.
</P>
<P>
 Rebel commander Sam Bockarie was quoted as saying his men would
only cease to fight with the ECOMOG troops if detained rebel leader Foday
Sankoh was freed.
</P>
<P>
Bockarie said his guerrillas had taken over most of Freetown,
including the broadcasting station, and even the seaport.
</P>
<P>
 Aid workers and Freetown residents confirmed that the State House was
in rebel hands and that the Nigerian embassy had been burnt down.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the rebel claims were denied by both Information
Minister Julius Spencer and ECOMOG spokesman Chris Olukolade.
</P>
<P>
"They have been subdued. It will be over before nightfall,"
Spencer told BBC Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"No part of Freetown has fallen from us," Olukolade told the
same program, adding that ECOMOG was exercising self-restraint
to avoid heavy civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the U. N. World Food Program said serious food shortages
now threatened the capital of Freetown, especially the 63,000 people it had
been feeding. Freetown has about 400,000 people at present and the country
has a population of over four million.

<P>
HARARE, January 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 120,000 families in the
Mberengwa district of southern Zimbabwe are starving because of food
shortage, a parliamentarian has said.
</P>
<P>
Member of parliament for Mberengwa West Jiram Bumbo told the daily
Herald Wednesday that food shortage in the district had reached a critical
stage at which human life was under threat.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the government to urgently deliver food assistance to
the starving families, saying failure to do so within the next three weeks
may result in some people starving to death.
</P>
<P>
In the past three months, he said, no food went to people registered on
the government's grain loan scheme.
</P>
<P>
The food situation was worsened by a critical shortage of mealie-meal
which hit some urban centers in the last two months, he said.
</P>
<P>
He lamented the failure by the government to declare Mberengwa district
a disaster area given that Matabeleland South, which is close to the
district, had been declared a disaster area.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- World number two Martina
Hingis beat world number one Lindsay Davenport on Thursday at the
Hopman Cup Mixed Teams Tennis Tournament in Perth of Australia.
</P>
<P>
American Davenport claimed the top ranking off Hingis with her
win in the U.S. Open last October, but the Swiss teenager was too
good in their first meeting for 1999, winning 6-3, 5-7, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Though Davenport had 12 aces during the three sets, four more
than Hingis did, and almost matched her rival in others, but the
world No.1 made 23 unforced backhand errors while Hingis had only
12.
</P>
<P>
"We both had good returns, and there's a lot of pressure on
both sides,"Hingis told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation
shortly after the match.
</P>
<P>
She described her wins over Davenport, who took the world No.
1 from her last year, as "an exhibition, more or less".
</P>
<P>
The result will not directly affect the women's world
standings, however it will give 18-year-old Hingis a
psychological edge over Davenport in the leadup to the Australian
Open later this month.
</P>
<P>
During round robin matches on Thursday between Switzerland and
the United States, Switzerland leads 1-0.

<P>
DHAKA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Garments
Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) has initialed the
process of canceling the membership of 72 apparel factories for
"false registration" with the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB).
</P>
<P>
The 72 factories were among the 319 garments and knitwear
factories that had submitted "false" documents to get registered
with the EPB and had recently been deprived of export licenses,
The Bangladesh Observer newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Wednesday, BGMEA President Mostafa
Golam Quddus said these apparel factories had tarnished the image
of the country's ready-made garment sector in the global market
and affected the genuine exporters and manufactures.
</P>
<P>
The factories were previously charged by the EPB with providing
false documents regarding bonded warehouse, Generalized System of
Preference certificates and fake papers for obtaining export visa.
</P>
<P>
There are over 3,000 garments and knitwear factories in
Bangladesh, which contribute to about 70 percent of the country's
total export earnings.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Spurs Efforts on Kosovo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) envoy to
Kosovo Wolfgang Petritsch urged the two conflicting factions --
Serbian authorities and ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, to
use the January-February period to make all possible efforts to
advance the negotiation process in the southern province of the
Serbia republic.
</P>
<P>
Petritsch was quoted by Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency as
telling the local Albanian-language newspaper Koha Ditore in
Pristina that 1999 is a crucial year to achieve reconciliation in
the ethnic Albanian-dominated province.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian diplomat said the EU will make every effort to
encourage the conflicting parties to reach a consensus on a
political solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, he said a political solution does not mean
independence for Kosovo, but autonomy with the participation of
all ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Petritsch, U.S. special envoy for Kosovo Christopher
Hill told the same newspaper that the use of force could not
resolve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
All armed men hiding in the woods must understand the Kosovo
issue can only be settled through political means, Hill added.
</P>
<P>
Before the two envoys called for calm in Kosovo, a grenade
attack occurred on Tuesday evening in a Serb cafe in the downtown
area of Pristina, in which three young men were injured.
</P>
<P>
Jovica Jovanovic, Kosovo's interim executive committee member
in charge of justice, said that the incident indicated the
provocation by the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army have spread
from the rural areas to the urban areas.
</P>
<P>
It was designed to provoke the Serbian police forces to start
a crackdown on separatists, which will give an excuse for a North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) intervention in Kosovo,
Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
Another Kosovo official Veljko Odalovic alleged that ethnic
Albanian militants in Kosovo have launched over 400 attacks on
Serb police and civilians, killing more than 40 of them and
driving many Serbian and Montenegrin residents out from their
homes in about a dozen villages.
</P>
<P>
He accused Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) observers of not honoring their obligations.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE personnel forgot that the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia "is a sovereign state" and "has the right to defend
its borders."

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Opposition Issues Demands for City Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Eight opposition parties in
Bangladesh have issued a joint declaration of demands for
participating in the coming municipal and city elections.
</P>
<P>
The parties would launch a simultaneous movement to boycott the
polls if the demands, which were announced separately on
Wednesday, were not accepted by the government within 30 days,
press reports here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Elections to 139 of the country's 182 municipalities would be
held on February 23-25, the Election Commission said earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
The demands of the major opposition -- the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party, the Jatiya Party, the Jammat-e-Islami and the
Islami Oikya Jote (Islami Solidarity Front) -- and four other
parties included: the resignation of the Chief Election
Commissioner, the reorganization of the commission, distribution
of voters' identity cards in all municipalities and cities, the
release of jailed political leaders and workers, withdrawal of
false cases against them and an end to arrest and repression of
political leaders and workers.
</P>
<P>
In the joint declaration, the opposition parties alleged that
no polls would be fair under the present Election Commission, and
accused the government of repressing the opposition leaders and
workers.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the opposition's joint declaration, Mohammad Nasim,
the ruling Bangladesh Awami League's organizing secretary, said
"the Awami League will remain busy in the elections...We don't
care if they (pro-movement opposition) call a few hartals and hold
rallies during the election period."
</P>
<P>
Chief Election Commissioner Mohammad Abu Hena, in response to
the opposition's demand, said he was "not at all hesitant" to quit
if "the greater interest of the people and the country" called for
it, a report in The Daily Star said.

percent of the total households nationwide or a 2 percent decrease
compared with 1997, according to an official report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Also in 1998, the report said, 15 provinces and cities in this

and 21 provinces, from 11-19 percent.
</P>
<P>
A two-day conference to launch the national program on hunger

<HEADLINE> NBA to Pay NBC and Turner Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The NBA will pay the TV
networks NBC and Turner Sports millions of dollars for the NBA
games missed during the lockout labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
NBC already has canceled nine telecasts, plus the February 14
All-Star game. The network, which signed a four-year, $1.75
billion deal prior to this season, is expected to receive its
money back for the missed telecasts during the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Turner paid $178 million a year for four seasons and will miss
about 50 games. But it will try to insert about 20 games into the
remainder of this season's schedule.
</P>
<P>
With rights to 26 of the 29 NBA games, Fox Sports Net has
replaced pro basketball games with regional classics and other
low-rated programs.
</P>
<P>
"We produce more NBA games than anyone else," said Arthur
Smith, Fox Sports Net executive vice president for programming
and production.
</P>
<P>
"Our substitute programming did well, but not as well as our
NBA games. It's fair to say we lost the most until now, but
nobody benefits more than us from here on in."
</P>
<P>
The first NBC tele cast could be a triple-header on February
7, and the Bulls at Lakers would have been one of those games.
</P>
<P>
A total of 50 games is expected. Fox lost more than 500 games
through the end of January, and the network would not estimate
its financial loss.
</P>
<P>
"Fox regional lost a lot of games," said Neal Pilson, the
former president of CBS who runs a consulting firm. "NBC won't be
damaged significantly because the bulk of their season is coming
up. The postseason is always when they draw their best ratings."
</P>
<P>
"The lockout probably won't have any effect on the ratings
until the postseason," said Steve Grubbs of BBDO Worldwide
Advertising.
</P>
<P>
"Michael Jordan's return may have a bigger impact than
anything, but in terms of advertising, we've been walking way
from the NBA because we feel they've lost touch with the
consumers."

<HEADLINE> Dengue Outbreak May Affect New Areas in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Health Ministry
has warned that areas which did not have outbreaks of dengue last
year may not be spared this year, the Jakarta Post reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An outbreak would likely happen in the transition from the
rainy to dry season, said director of the eradication of
animal-source contagious diseases Thomas Suroso.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains are expected to increase over the next few months
across the country, creating more pools of water for mosquitoes to
breed in, including areas unaffected by dengue last year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's 1998 data for dengue reveals that 14 out of the
country's 27 provinces were the most affected.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that the remaining 13 provinces will experience
outbreaks as heavy rains will leave water in pipes, gutters and
any other breeding sites of the mosquitoes", he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's director general of communicable disease control
Achmad Sujudi said that between January and April last year, 345
people died of dengue fever. There were 16,434 cases.
</P>
<P>
"In the same period of 1997, 68 people died out of 5,559
cases," he said.
</P>
<P>
The health agency reported that as of Wednesday, some 470
children suffered from dengue in Tegal, Central Java province. Six
of them had died.
</P>
<P>
Besides the six recent deaths, 36 others have died from dengue
fever in Central Java over the past three months.
</P>
<P>
In Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara province, dozens of children have
fallen ill with dengue in the past two months, two died due to
late treatment.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever, an acute tropical disease transmitted by
mosquitoes, leaves its victims with fever, rash and severe pains
in the joints and back. The cholera-like disease causes vomiting
and diarrhea.

<HEADLINE> Accused Contractor Wins His Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A man accused of corruption was
ruled innocent in his appeal trial recently in Central China's
Hubei Province, the Beijing-Based China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The case caught nationwide media attention because it involves
the definition of legal rights of private businesses and those of
"collective-owned" economic entities, which are large in number
in China.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qun former contractor of a medical facilities service
center in the city of Honghu, had been accused of embezzling more
than 200,000 yuan (US$24,000), and was sentenced to life
imprisonment by the Jinzhou Intermediate People's Court, the
court of the first instance.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that Wang, a contractor for the center, had
illegally occupied and used State capital by repeatedly
reimbursing receipts, failing to record in the accounts some of
the medicines sold and exaggerating the amount of stored medicine.
</P>
<P>
The Hubei Higher People's court, however, after receiving an
appeal from Wang, decided after examining a notarized contract
that Wang was a contractor at his own risk, not so-called
collective enterprise who was connected to the center.
</P>
<P>
Wang's actions, therefore, had not infringed on the State
capital, the court ruled.
</P>
<P>
In China, collective contractors only have the rights to use
and manage capital while those working at their own risk are
entitled to ownership of the capital of the entities contracted.
</P>
<P>
"This case concerns the interpretation of the country's policy
on contract," the daily quoted a judge at the Criminal Court of
the Hubei Higher People's Court as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We just tried to protect the lawful rights of the
contractors," the judge said.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers in Beijing said such a ruling by the Higher People's
Court will have far-reaching impact on many other cases involving
contractors who are either self-employed or linked with a
collective-owned economic entity.

<HEADLINE> S. Lankan Rebels' Regional Leaders Desert LTTE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of senior regional
leaders of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are
deserting the organization following defeats at Mankulam and
Kilinochchi in northern Sri Lanka, said reports reaching here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior Tamil political leader, over 20 regional
leaders had handed in their resignations during the last two
months, saying that the LTTE could never win the war.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the Mullaitivu area leader of the
LTTE and his three associates have been arrested on the orders of
LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran for defying orders.
</P>
<P>
There were also reports earlier that the internal power
struggle in the LTTE prompted many rebel cadres leaving their
organization. Several rebel leaders were killed after defection.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the rising number of deserters and the
arrest of the Mullaitivu leader indicate a growing division within
the ranks of the LTTE and a turning point in the scenario of LTTE
operations.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting a war against the government
for a separate state of its own in the north and east of the
country since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Sports Program Must Put Olympics First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former sports
minister Hayono Isman recommended that provincial administrations
deal with shrinking sports budget allotments by setting their
sights on the most viable Olympic-medal winning disciplines.
</P>
<P>
Hayono was responding to the State Budget draft allocating
60.7 billion rupiah (about 8 million U.S. dollars) for youth
affairs and sports, a 30 percent drop from last year's 86.7
billion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"I think relying only on the State Budget won't be enough in
developing sports, particularly during the economic crisis," he
was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The government, in this case the state minister of youth
affairs and sports office, should issue guidelines on how to use
the money solely to boost priority sports," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hayono said the government guidelines must refer to the
National Sports Council's long-term program Golden Garuda, which
aims to shoot Indonesia to sixth on the medals standing at the
Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Agung Laksono
called on all provinces on Tuesday to financially help national
sports development.
</P>
<P>
Hayono, Agung's predecessor, said sports development must
concentrate on sports with the greatest potential to land medals.
</P>
<P>
"Badminton and archery top the priority list, followed by
potential sports which include karate and windsurfing," said
Hayono.
</P>
<P>
Next on the priority list should be sports in which the
country could excel in the Asian Games, Hayono believed. They
include athletics and tennis.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that provinces be assigned a sport for
specialization.
</P>
<P>
"West Java may focus on badminton, Bali on windsurfing,
Southeast Sulawesi on rowing, canoeing and traditional boat
races," he added.

<HEADLINE> Health Ministry Calls For Better Hospital Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Health has
urged all hospitals to surrender profits from the sale of
medicines as a measure to improve service and earnestly follow
the reform procedures for 1999.
</P>
<P>
With the new system, income from medicines and treatments will
be accounted and administered separately, according to Health
Minister Zhang Wenkang.
</P>
<P>
The reform aims to end the practice of "lengthy prescriptions"
- a common practice in many hospitals that make money from sales
in order to make up for low fees charged for consultations and
some sophisticated treatments, Zhang was quoted by today's "China
Daily" as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from medicine sales often make up more than half of
total income of hospitals, which has compelled doctors to
prescribe medicines as expensive as possible, but pay less
attention to treatments.
</P>
<P>
Profits from sales of medicines will be put under monopolized
management by local health administrative departments, which will
later be returned to hospitals rationally according to their
service quality and efficiency, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals will be permitted to raise fees for technical
services such as clinical consultations and surgeries.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals are to be challenged as a new medical insurance
system enables people to choose hospital service more freely, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Health Ministry is also going to attach importance to
developing medical service in vast rural areas, where poor
residents are in bad need for adequate medicines and doctors.

<HEADLINE> Spring Arrives Early in Prague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Instead of feeling the bitter
cold during the winter season, the Czechs are now bathed in the
warmth of an early spring.
</P>
<P>
The capital city of Belgrade in the Czech Republic is
experiencing the second warm winter since 1948 with its highest
temperature on Tuesday hitting 13.8 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
With the early arrival of spring weather conditions, Belgrade
has taken on a complete spring look: the melting away of snow and
the greening of trees, grass and flowers. People have stripped
themselves of clumsy winter clothes and are dressing in lighter
spring suits.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists here attribute the abnormality in the Czech
weather conditions to the impact of global warming and an inflow
of warm and damp air currents from the southwest.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the convenience that the warm weather has brought,
it has unfortunately heightened people's chances of developing
illness and diseases. Currently, the number of people suffering
from colds in the country is on a rapid rise. The northern part
of the Czech Republic witnessed a 25-percent increase in colds
among the population as compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts here fear the Czech Republic may be overtaken
by widespread flu attacks.

<HEADLINE> Bus Accident Kills at Least 24 in Bolivia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LA PAZ, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A bus plunged off from a
120-meter cliff in southern Bolivia Wednesday, killing at least
24 people and injuring 11 others, police commander Ivar Narvaez
said.
</P>
<P>
The injured were taken to hospitals in Tarija and some of them
died en route, Narvaez said.
</P>
<P>
The bus was reportedly riding on a mountain road linking
Tarija, 950 kilometers south of this administrative capital of
Bolivia, with the Andean farming town of Tupiza, when it went off
from the cliff.
</P>
<P>
The dirt road the ill-fated bus was riding on has poor
visibility and most buses covering the route are old and often
overloaded and at high speed.
</P>
<P>
However, the cause of the accident is still unknown.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Urged to Address Liquidity Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai businessmen on Thursday
urged the government to continue efforts to address the liquidity
problem which obstructs economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The businesses circles were preparing a seminar to address the
liquidity problem later this month, business sources said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda both plan to address the seminar that would bring
together business representatives nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, the biggest of its kind in Thailand, will also be
attended by senior government officials such as province
governors, ministers, and representatives of the National Economic
and Social Development Board.
</P>
<P>
The government has been making attempts to reduce lending rates
and press commercial banks to resume lending in order to defuse
the economic crisis, but these efforts must be matched by attempts
to solve the liquidity problem, the Thai Chamber of Commerce said.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said that solving the liquidity problem
would be one of the priorities in the new year. But Thai
businessmen want the government to mete out specific measures.
</P>
<P>
Thailand needs 26.1 billion U.S. dollars in capital inflow over
the next 12 months to overcome the present tight liquidity. From
October 1996 until last year, Thailand lost more than 12 billion
dollars through capital flight and over the next 12 months
Thailand will have to repay 6.1 billion dollars of short-tern
foreign debt and another 8 billion dollars will be needed to repay
the Bank of Thailand's swap obligations.
</P>
<P>
Because of the liquidity crunch, about 300,000 businesses have
closed down since the financial crisis erupted in July 1997.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says Reports of UNSCOM Spying Nothing New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Ambassador to the
United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, said on Wednesday the reports that
U.N. arms inspectors had helped the United States to spy on Iraq
proved what his country had been saying all along.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon was responding to reports in two U.S. newspapers on
Wednesday that inspectors of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)
in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction had
helped U.S. intelligence agents to spy on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"For us this is not really news," Hamdoon told the press.
</P>
<P>
"We are accusing the UNSCOM of doing exactly the same that was
confirmed today by the Washington Post: this is for the UNSCOM to
be utilized by the United States government to try to destabilize
the government in Baghdad," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a victory for the truth which Iraq has been
advocating for quite some time now. In the past nobody believed
us. I think now our word will have to be trusted," said the top
Iraqi representative here.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon said the U.N. Security Council should lift sanctions
on Iraq's exports, such as oil, linking to requirements that Iraq
no longer has weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"That is the least the Council should do at this point to
compensate for all the damage that was done to the Iraqi nation
by the type of work we had from the UNSCOM," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Vows to Complete Privatization in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The privatization will be done in complete transparency, he
said at a traditional New Year cocktail party for chief foreign
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Kostov called on all countries to take an active part in
Bulgaria's privatization process in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
"The pace of privatization so far clearly does not correspond
to the government's intentions," Kostov said. "Regrettably, some
of the transactions concluded through international
intermediaries have drawn most criticism."
</P>
<P>
"To overcome this weakness, Bulgaria will count in the coming
months on the active cooperation of your countries' governments,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Kostov also briefed his guests on Bulgaria's achievements in
stabilizing the economy and containing crime in 1998. Though
times were tough, Bulgarian people last year saw a great
improvement in living conditions compared with 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Ambassador to Sofia Heitor Maia e Silva said that
he appreciated the "tremendous efforts" the Bulgarian government
has made in developing the economy and preparing the state
administration and the private sector for the "major challenge
posed by Bulgaria's bid to join the European Union and NATO".

<HEADLINE> Euro to Put Indonesia in Competition With Eurozone Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The launching of the Euro will
cause Indonesia to face fierce competition from Eurozone countries
and other developing countries in marketing its products in
Europe, the Industry and Trade Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The relatively stable and strong Euro would help the Eurozone
countries to post higher economic growth, which would in the end
create job openings and increase their per capita incomes and
living standards, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The condition would most likely increase demand for imported
goods produced by fellow Eurozone countries as well as developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the competition between Indonesia and the
Eurozone countries and other developing nations would increase in
intensity, chief of the ministry's public relations service Lily
Rosyana said in a press release issued here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lily said that demand for goods produced by developing
countries would remain because many of them were not produced by
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"The commodities which are still in great demand in European
Union countries are agricultural products such as coffee, spices
and tuna as well as consumer goods such as paper, textiles,
utensils, souvenirs and electronics," she said.
</P>
<P>
Lily expressed the hope that the Indonesian business world
would capitalize on the opportunities at the time when the
Eurozone countries adjusted the prices of their commodities to the
Euro.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian businessmen still had the chance to maintain or even
increase their market share in Europe although the launching of
the Euro would likely have an impact on Indonesian exports, she
said.
</P>
<P>
The quality of products was therefore a crucial factor in
enabling Indonesian exporters to withstand fierce competition with
Eurozone countries and other developing countries, she was quoted
by Antara News Agency Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's exports to Europe rose by 400 percent to 7.1
billion U.S. dollars in 1997 from 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in
1987.

<P>
NINGBO, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Ningbo Port, a major coastal
city of east China's Zhejiang Province, handled 350,000 TEU (ton
equivalent unit) containers in 1998, up 37 percent on 1997.
</P>
<P>
This increase has resulted from an extensive overseas
promotion campaigns waged by the local authorities and improved
services at the local customs in an effort to offset losses
incurred by the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The port has placed priority on improving services related to
customs inspections on commodities, animals and plants.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a number new container shipping lanes have been
opened from Ningbo to various other major domestic and foreign
ports. At present, Ningbo's container shipping routes are linked
up with Europe, Japan, Republic of Korea and southeast Asian
countries, in addition to domestic ports such as Guangzhou,
Tianjin and Dalian.

<HEADLINE> United Efforts Needed to Solve Beijing Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A solution to Beijing's air
pollution problems requires cooperation from the whole society,
as well as the government, a local environmental official said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
 Yu Xiaoxuan, deputy director of the Beijing Environmental
Protection Bureau, said that although the environmental awareness
of the government officials and the public has greatly improved,
there were still problems in implementing the city's 19 emergency
measures to combat serious air pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
 Every work unit with large boilers should use low-sulfur
coal, instead of inferior grade, high-polluting fuel, to reduce
airborne particulates, today's China Daily quoted Yu as saying.
</P>
<P>
 Sulfur dioxide, a kind of harmful gas, can cause diseases in
human respiratory systems and result in erosive acid rain.
</P>
<P>
 Over 90 percent of the sulfur dioxide in the air during
winter comes from high-sulfur coal.
</P>
<P>
 People should know that they are benefiting not only others
but also themselves by using low-sulfur coal, because everyone
breathes the same air, Yu noted.
</P>
<P>
 Every work unit in the city should try to be a model, not
using high-sulfur coal for its boilers, getting rid of cars past
their life expectancy, and cars not up to standards in exhaust
emissions.
</P>
<P>
 So far orders for 1.3 million tons of low-sulfur
high-quality coal have been placed since this winter by various
work units in this city.
</P>
<P>
 Industries around the city also constitutes a major source
of air pollution, according to Yu. In the 1950s, a group of light
and heavy industries were developed in this city. In the western
parts of Beijing, the Capital Iron and Steel Plant produces a
considerable amount of pollutants.
</P>
<P>
 Every year, millions of tons of coal are consumed in
production and daily life.
</P>
<P>
 Yu added that over the past decade, annual coal consumption
has increased by 32 percent and the number of automobiles
doubled. Both are major sources of nitrogen oxides.

<HEADLINE> Hubei Plans to Reduce Logging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province
plans to reduce its annual logging volume by one million cu.m. as
part of an effort to curb erosion.
</P>
<P>
The provincial forestry administration said the annual logging
volume has already been cut from eight million to seven million
cubic meter. The administration also announced a plan to carry
out afforestation projects on 2.33 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
Hubei plans to raise its forest coverage rate to 30 percent
over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The unchecked falling of natural forests was partly blamed for
last summer's record flooding in the Yangtze River Valley, the
heaviest in over five decades.

<HEADLINE> Tough Task for Indonesian Boxing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Amateur Boxing
Federation (Pertina) faces a potentially tough task ahead with
the mission to emulate the success of the last edition of the
Southeast Asian (SEA) Games and to keep good form for the Olympic
s.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge in will be tougher than ever," Pertina
Secretary General Didit Sudijoto told reporters here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian boxing team will be seeking to repeat their
victories in the last SEA Games and their success in
qualification ahead of the finals of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia took six gold medals at the 19th SEA Games in
Jakarta. The upcoming edition will be held in Brunei later this
August.
</P>
<P>
"The chase for at least the same gold spike as we did in
Jakarta should not be an easy duty given the fact that Thailand
and the Philippines are equally renowned for good boxers.
Therefore, we must make a sound program for the preparation,"
Didit said.
</P>
<P>
As to the upcoming Olympics, Didit said that Indonesia would
vie for five places in Sydney as they did in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
However, Indonesian boxers will have to endure tough tests in
the qualifying arenas scheduled for Tashkent on October 10, Seoul
in January and Bangkok in June.
</P>
<P>
"Our good job in guiding five boxers to Atlanta has motivated
us in the wake of the Sydney Olympics, although we are well aware
of difficult times because the venues for qualification are
countries of traditionally stiff contenders," Didit was quoted by
the Indonesian Observer Thursday as saying.

<HEADLINE> Ford to Outfit Vehicles With Collision Sensors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. automaker Ford
Motor Company announced Wednesday that it plans to begin
outfitting its vehicles this year with sensors that can measure
the severity of an impending frontal collision.
</P>
<P>
At the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, the
company said its Advanced Restraints System will be added to new
models until all of its cars, sport utility vehicles and truck
products have the features.
</P>
<P>
According to Yahoo News On Line, the system works by analyzing
various conditions at the instant of an impact. The sensors would
also measure the size and weight of the driver and if there is a
front seat passenger. Other sensors measure the position the
occupants are in and if they are wearing a seat belt.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped the system can be used to adjust the force at
which the air bag deploys, avoiding the problem air bags
inflating with too much power and injuring people in the front
seat.

<HEADLINE> Peru: No Change In Free Market Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Peru's new Prime Minister and
Economy Minister Victor Joy Way said Wednesday that his
government will not change the free market policy launched in
1990.
</P>
<P>
"We will not turn away from the market economy model, which is
the only one to successfully integrate us into the world as well
as generate jobs and a stable economic growth," Joyway said.
</P>
<P>
The new prime minister, who was sworn in on Tuesday, said the
new cabinet would implement "stability and security" measures to
attract private investment. Peru must have "clear rules to
generate confidence among investors."
</P>
<P>
The new government will give priority to the rebuilding of
roads, bridges and installations damaged by the floods caused by
the El Nino phenomenon, or the warming of tropical Pacific Ocean
waters.
</P>
<P>
Joy Way said the government would also continue its programs
to build basic social infrastructures and improve health and
education indicators.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Peru's economy grew only by about 1.5 percent due
to the Asian economic crises and damages caused by the El Nino
phenomenon.

<P>
CARACAS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Over 9.4 tons of drugs were
seized by Venezuelan police in 1998, newspapers here said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
General Luis Alberto Camacho Kairuz, who heads the anti-drugs
department of the National Guard, was quoted as saying that the
drugs included more than five tons of cocaine, 3.9 tons of
marijuana, 427 kilos of cocaine base and 24 kilos of heroin. The
police also confiscated over 93.7 tons of chemicals used to
manufacture drugs.
</P>
<P>
A total of 356 alleged drug traffickers were detained last
year, including 255 Venezuelans and 101 foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Camacho said that the quantity of the seizure had slightly
declined compared with previous years.
</P>
<P>
However, the anti-drugs chief warned that Venezuela, which is
being used as a transit route by drug smugglers, could end up
having an uncontrollable drug problem like Colombia in the future
if the government does not crack down now on traffickers.

<HEADLINE> Stern, Hunter Reach Agreement to End NBA Lockout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- After months of acrimonious
negotiations, NBA commissioner David Stern and Players
Association executive director Billy Hunter hammered out a deal,
ending the lockout, saving the season and perhaps the future of
the sport.
</P>
<P>
Stern and Hunter worked through the night to reach a
settlement just hours before NBA players were to vote on the
league's "final" proposal, and one day before the so-called "drop
dead" date for the cancellation of the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the NBA and union have yet to announce the
deal, but Stern has notified league officials that a collective
bargaining agreement has been reached, pending ratification.
</P>
<P>
The NBA Board of Governors will vote on the agreement Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
ESPN is reporting that a 52-game regular season will begin on
February 2 if the deal is approved. The season will extend into
May, well past the original April 21 closing date.
</P>
<P>
Stern rejected the union's final proposal on Monday and
Hunter, yielding to internal and external pressure to put the
league's offer to a vote of the rank and file, summoned the
players to New York. An individual role call vote was scheduled
for this afternoon today.
</P>
<P>
After the secret all-night session between Stern and Hunter,
the deal was struck sometime around 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
The owners' and players' negotiating committee recommended
approving the six-year deal, which give the NBA an option for a
seventh year.
</P>
<P>
The players approved it 179-5 in a ratification vote at the
union's law office this afternoon, a union spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A season of about 50 games would begin the first week of
February, with training camps not starting before January 7.
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I'm so relieved it's unbelievable," Milwaukee Bucks coach
George Karl said. "It's like I let a balloon out of my stomach.
The knots are already loosening up in my neck. I get to do what I
love to do."
</P>
<P>
The union agreed to accept 55 percent of revenues in the
fourth, fifth and sixth years of the agreement, sources said.
Players would get 57 percent if the league exercises its option
for the seventh year. In the first three years, there is no limit
on the percentage of revenues players can receive.
</P>
<P>
According to the local press, following are the details among
the other compromises:
</P>
<P>
-- The union agreed to a $14 million maximum salary for
players with 10 years' experience. Players with one to five
years' experience can get a maximum of $9 million, and players
with six to nine years' experience can get $11 million.
</P>
<P>
-- The union agreed to a three-year rookie scale with teams
holding an option for the fourth year and the right of first
refusal in the fifth year.
</P>
<P>
-- The league accepted the union's proposal for an "average"
salary exception and "median" salary exception, with both being
phased in during the next three years. As a result, every team
will have the right to sign two additional players each season,
even if they are over the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
-- The annual allowable salary increases will be 12 percent
for players with so-called Larry Bird rights -- those free agents
re-signed by a team without regard to the salary cap -- and 10
percent for others.
</P>
<P>
-- Changes to free agency timing rules will be phased in, with
free agents counting 200, 250 or 300 percent against their old tea
m's salary cap until that team re-signs them or renounces their
rights.
</P>
<P>
-- The league agreed to higher minimum salaries than it had
been offering, although the exact amounts weren't immediately
known.
</P>
<P>
The league and the union had been fighting over how to divide
an estimated $2 billion in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
NBA players have the highest average salary in professional
sports, about $2.6 million annually, and the median salary is
about $1.3 million. NFL players average about $900,000, and major
league baseball pays an average of $1.45 million.
</P>
<P>
A total of 437 games already been lost due to the lockout,
which lasted 190 days and cost the league its previously perfect
mark of never having lost a game to a work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
It also cost owners and players hundreds of millions of
dollars and may have done irreparable damage to the popularity of
the league.

<HEADLINE> Ahonen Wins Four Hill Tour, Widhoelzl Final Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Janne Ahonen of Finland Wednesday
became the eighth skijumper to win the prestigious Four Hill Tour
title without a top spot in one of the four individual jumps in
Bischofshofen in Austria.
</P>
<P>
Ahonen, 21, placed second on the day behind Andreas Widhoelzl
of Austria.
</P>
<P>
That was good enough to win the 47th edition's overall Tour
standings with 960.6 points from a fifth-place finish last
Wednesday in Oberstdorf and other second-place finishes in
Garmisch-Partenkirchen (Friday) and Innsbruck (Sunday) in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The last man to capture the Tour trophy without a day-win was
Ahonen's compatriot Penti Laakonen in 1989. For Ahonen, it was
the second major title after a world championship gold medal 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ahonen snatched the top spot from Japan's Noriaki Kasai, who
had to settle for fourth place Wednesday. Kasai had a total 953
points and was a runner-up for the second time after 1993. Both
had been separated by a mere four-tenth of a point coming into
the final event.
</P>
<P>
Kasai had 125 and 123 meters on the day, but Ahonen showed
nerves like steel by sailing 124.5 and 126m for 255.9 points on
the day.
</P>
<P>
Widhoelzl, meanwhile, delighted the 30,000 home fans by
dominating in both jumps (127.5 and 128.5m) for a winning total
of 263.3 points.
</P>
<P>
Hideharu Mirahira of Japan placed third on the day and by
doing so snatched third place overall with 916.8 points from
German sensation Martin Schmitt, who had won in Oberstdorf and
Garmisch. Schmitt was 14th Wednesday and finished with a total
915.6 points.
</P>
<P>
Ahonen also remained on top of the overall World Cup standings
with now 893 points from 12 of 30 events. Schmitt is a distant
second with 778 and Kasai third with 582 points.
</P>
<P>
The World Cup continues at the weekend with two competitions
in Engelberg, Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Peace Talks Success Linked to Rebel Chief Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The
success of Thursday's third peace talks in the past 15 years is
believed to depend on the presence of Manuel Marulanda, the
leader of America's most powerful leftist guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
Colombia could have its first opportunity for peace in 50
years if the leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC) meets as scheduled with conservative President Andres
Pastrana on the first day of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks, the first one in almost seven years, is
scheduled to take place here in San Vincente del Caguan. With
some 45,000 inhabitants, it is the largest town in southeast
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
President Pastrana will attend the talks.
</P>
<P>
The 20,000 strong FARC is expected to demand the elimination
of pro-government paramilitary groups as well as sweeping
agrarian reforms, wealth redistribution and an end to free market
policies.
</P>
<P>
The government wants the rebels to release police and soldiers
as part of an exchange of prisoners, and a truce to reorganize
its weakened 50,000 strong army.
</P>
<P>
Another key issue is the government's pledge to destroy coca
and opium plantations, with 290 million dollars in US aid this
year.
</P>
<P>
The FARC is being accused by both Washington and Colombian
officials of using funds from the drug trade. The rebels are
believed to earn over 790 million U.S. dollars a year from drug
trafficking, kidnapping and extortion.

<HEADLINE> US Embargo Affects Cuban Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. embargo against Cuba is
damaging the Caribbean island country's health care despite the
easing of restrictions announced by Washington this week, Cuban
Health Minister Carlos Dotres said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot allow conditions to be placed on (medicine) sales.
I believe that this does not make the announced (program) very
feasible," he said.
</P>
<P>
The program to ease a 1961 U.S. trade embargo against Cuba,
which was formally announced Tuesday by President Bill Clinton,
calls for an expansion of medicine, food and agricultural sales.
</P>
<P>
It also increases cash transfers from U.S. citizens to Cubans,
more people exchanges and direct mail service.
</P>
<P>
But the five-point program excludes members of the Cuban
Communist Party and government officials. The sale of goods is
only allowed to non-government entities.
</P>
<P>
"What is currently happening is that there is an attempt to
impose a series of limitations on North American companies
wishing to sell medicines to Cuba. They are told where the
medicine is going and who is going to use it," Dotres said.
</P>
<P>
"We need more information on Clinton's statement," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are obstacles stemming from the embargo laws and a
transparent trade is not possible if there are conditions,"
Dotres said.

<HEADLINE> Yemen Hostage Death Probe Due to Resume: UK Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Wednesday that
detectives from Britain and the United States should be allowed to
resume their inquiry into the deaths of hostages in South Yemen
shortly.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman said the decision in Yemen to order
the detectives, who were probing a fatal hostage rescue operation,
to leave Aden earlier this week was not the official policy of the
Yemeni authorities.
</P>
<P>
The detectives, investigating how three British and one
Australian hostages were killed during a shoot-out between
kidnappers and Yemeni government forces last week, were told to
leave but now had returned to the capital Sanaa.
</P>
<P>
"There was a mix-up between the government and the local chief
in Aden, who was not properly instructed," a British official told
reporters in London.
</P>
<P>
"If the detectives want to go back, we are confident they will
be able to do so. They will stay in Yemen for another week or so,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the Yemeni government had cooperated
well with Britain since the killings.
</P>
<P>
The British and U.S. detectives arrived in Yemen last week to
probe the rescue bid in which a Briton and an American were also
injured. The victims were among 16 Western tourists taken hostage
by Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Britain twice summoned Yemen's ambassador to London
to complain that it had not received a full account of the raid.
</P>
<P>
Yemen has insisted that its forces had to go in because the
kidnappers had started killing the hostages.

<HEADLINE> Major Semiconductor Vendors Suffer Severe Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Most major semiconductor
manufacturers in the world suffered severe revenue decline in
1998, a year slated to be the worse since the mid-1980s, according
to a U.S. research firm.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest said in a report released Tuesday that seven of the
top 11 vendors saw their worldwide revenue drop by at least 14
percent last year. Contributed to the situation were
over-capacity, Asian financial crisis, and the falling market of
dynamic random access memory (DRAM) which suffered its third bad
year in a row.
</P>
<P>
Intel was one of the few vendors to post positive revenue in
the year, with revenue surpassing 22.6 billion U.S. dollars. Its
nearest rival, NEC, made 8.27 billion dollars, a 19 percent drop.
Other major sufferers include Motorola, Toshiba, Texas
Instruments, Samsung, Hitachi and Fujitsu.
</P>
<P>
On the regional basis, Dataquest said, Europe was the only
region in the world where vendor revenue gains outnumbered the
declines. Three European vendors -- Philips, STMicroelectronics
and Siemens -- all posted positive revenues and were made into the
worldwide top 10 vendor ranking for the first time.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Disagrees with Israeli Ambassador on Wye Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday that it did not agree with Israeli ambassador's
criticism of the Palestinians for failing to fulfil most of
promises they made in the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Ambassador Zalman Shoval said in an article published
in Wednesday's Washington Times that the Palestinians should be
responsible for the suspension of the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We do not share Ambassador Shoval's assessment at all," U.S.
State Department spokesman James Rubin told a briefing.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians have in fact worked hard to implement many
of their commitments under the Wye agreement, including
annulling clauses in the Palestine National Charter, and
stepping up the fight against terror. There are some commitments
that still have to be fulfilled. But in our view overall, they
are making progress here," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Let me point out that it is the Israelis who have not
fulfilled any of their Phase II obligations, by failing to pull
back the further redeployment," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has linked the next stage of
withdrawal from the West Bank with unilateral conditions added
after the Wye agreement. The Palestinians and the United States
say they do not recognize the new conditions.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Creates Web-Commerce Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Hoping to cash in on the
emerging market for Net retailing, Microsoft has created Complete
Commerce, a package of Web hosting, development and technical
support for electronic commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
The software giant said Monday that the "all-in-one" package
has been designed to meet huge demand from mid-sized to large
businesses looking for help in hosting e-commerce sites. Its
partners include chipmaker Intel, computer maker Compaq and 10
commercial hosting services. The program is aimed at Fortune 2000
companies.
</P>
<P>
While pricing will vary depending on the size of the sites to
be hosted, a typical configuration offering business to consumers
would cost roughly 50,000 U.S. dollars to build and host for three
months. Contracts also include a maintenance fee.
</P>
<P>
There have been various estimations of the worldwide e-commerce
potential. A moderate prediction made by the U.S. research firm
International Data Corporation (IDC) last year put e-commerce
revenue to 400 billion U.S. dollars by 2002. IDC also predicted
that the global Net audience will jump from 100 million by the end
of 1998 to 320 million by 2002.
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. research firm, Forrester Research, estimated last
November that worldwide "Internet commerce" sales will be between
1.4 trillion and 3.2 trillion U.S. dollars in 2003. The high
potential estimate would represent nearly five percent of all
global sales. Forrester defines "Internet commerce" as the trade
of goods and services in which the final order is placed over the
Internet. It includes business-to-business and
business-to-consumer sales and electronic data interchange (EDI)
orders placed on the Internet, but exclude the value of financial
transactions.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft has been increasingly active on the e-commerce
hosting and site-design front. Last August the company, along with
Hewlett-Packard and a troop of smaller vendors and consultancies
introduced E-Commerce Quick-Start, a bundle of hardware, software
and services to get companies up and running on an electronic
commerce system.

<HEADLINE> U.S., DPRK to Hold New Round of Talks in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) will hold a new round
of talks on January 16-17 in Geneva to discuss access to an
underground building site in DPRK, the State Department said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman James Rubin told a regular briefing that a working
level group met in New York on Tuesday to discuss the planned
talks and make arrangements for overall four-party talks in
Geneva. The four parties include the DPRK, South Korea, China and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States was seeking satisfying answer
about the site at the Kumchang-ri near the mothballed nuclear
reactor in Yongbyon, where Washington is suspicious of a new
nuclear reactor to be built, which, however, was categorically
denied by the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the four-party talks were due to begin on January
19. And the U.S. delegation will be led by Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs Charles Kartman.
</P>
<P>
These talks are aimed at replacing a now-fraying truce with a
permanent peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said bilateral relations between the U.S. and DPRK would
improve dramatically if progress were made on implementation of a
framework agreement, missile proliferation, the return of remains
of missing Americans and in the area of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"So, were we able to make success in those four areas, we are
prepared to improve our economic and political relations,
including by sanctions easing," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Bigger Budget Surplus for Fiscal 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Wednesday announced a bigger budget surplus of 76 billion U.S.
dollars for the fiscal year of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The budget surplus in fiscal 1999 would be the second in a row
after nearly three decades of deficits, and the largest in history
in dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
"I am proud to announce that we can say the era of big deficits
is over. We are now entering the second year of an era of
surpluses," Clinton said in announcing the surplus forecast at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
Vowing political battles would not obstruct his economic
agenda, he pledged to continue pursuing his economic agenda,
topped by a financial overhaul of the Social Security retirement
system, despite his impeachment trial in the Senate which begins
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The federal government in fiscal 1998 recorded a surplus of 70
billion U.S. dollars, its first budget surplus in 29 years.
</P>
<P>
The new forecast by the White House budget office for fiscal
1999, which ends on September 30, is an increase over the White
House's initial projection in May of a 54 billion dollars surplus
for 1999. The Congressional Budget Office in its August update
projected a surplus of 80 billion dollars for fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
A White House official attributed the increased forecast to a
"renewed strength in the economy." He said the U.S. economy slowed
less than expected in the third and fourth quarters of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Annan Condemns Reported Massacre in Congo(K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a statement issued through his spokesman, Annan, who has read
reports of the alleged massacre, said, "Throughout the conflict in the
DRC (the Democratic Republic of Congo), the Secretary-General has
called on all parties to respect human rights and international
humanitarian law. He reiterates that call today, as well as his strong
condemnation of killings and other atrocities such as those alleged to
have been committed at Makobola," eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General believes there can be no military solution
to the conflict," the statement said, "He will continue to actively
support current regional efforts to broker a ceasefire, the withdrawal
of foreign troops from the territory of the DRC, and a broadening of
the democratic space within the country."
</P>
<P>
About 500 people were massacred at Makobola, eastern Congo (K)
during the New Year holiday, reports said on Wednesday. However,
there is no independent confirmation of a massacre or of its size at
the moment.
</P>
<P>
If what the reports said are true, it would appear to be the
largest massacre since the start of a rebellion in August last year
against the government led by President Laurent Kabila. Both Kabila
and the rebels have since accused each other of carrying out mass
killings.
</P>
<P>
Kabila came to power in May 1997 after a military campaign across
the country, then Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Those killings, never fully investigated, had their roots in the
region's bitter ethnic conflict between the Tutsi and Hutu, and in
the massacres of more than half a million Tutsi in Rwanda in 1994.

<P>
LONDON January 6 (Xinhua) -- All major European stock markets
surged Wednesday, inspired by merger hopes, new year demand,
confidence in the new euro currency and a strong gains in Tokyo
and New York.
</P>
<P>
In London, the FTSE 100 index of leading shares breached the
6100 level for the first time since July, climbing 3.2 percent -
its biggest percentage gain since October 20.
</P>
<P>
It rose 190.6 to 6148.8, just shy of the 6157.4 session best as
a large wave of cash entered a market boosted by strong mobile
phone sales figures, telecom merger talk and rate cut hopes.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra Dax index also closed over 3 percent higher on
the same day amid tie-up speculation in the car and
telecommunications sectors.
</P>
<P>
The electronically traded Xetra Dax ended up 3.41 percent at
5442.90, its highest level since August 21. The floor Dax ended
3.61 percent higher at 5,443.62 points.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse joined in the New Year rally, with the Cac 40
index ending about 100 points shy of its all-time peak of last
July.
</P>
<P>
The rise was partly due to a revival in demand from
institutional investors who had held off for the euro conversion.
More merger speculation also helped.
</P>
<P>
The Cac 40 index closed up 2.24 percent, 94.04 points higher at
4294.82. All-time best was 4404.94 on July 20 last year.

<HEADLINE> Study Identifies Subconscious Alarm Clock of Human Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A hormone in the blood may hold
the keys of the body's natural alarm clocks which can
subconsciously wake people up when they want, German scientists
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the expectation of waking at a certain time
induces a marked increase in the concentration of
adrenocorticotropin, the hormone which is the key wake-up factor,
wrote the researchers from the University of Lubeck, Germany, in
the scientific journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
The hormones released before waking could help people to
anticipate the "stress" of getting up at different hours, the
researchers suggested.
</P>
<P>
Normally levels of adrenocorticotropin and cortisol, hormones
released by the adrenal and pituitary glands, increase during the
late stages of sleep.
</P>
<P>
However, after waking some volunteers who had expected to sleep
peacefully until 9 a.m. some 3 hours earlier, the scientists found
that levels of adrenocorticotropin of the volunteers increased
substantially in the last hour before waking.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the concentration of adrenocorticotropin was
also present before waking in people who had been told that they
would only sleep for a short period, the researchers reported.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in adrenocorticotropin release before the
expected time of waking indicates that anticipation, which is
generally considered to be a unique characteristic of conscious
action, pervades sleep," the researchers concluded.

<HEADLINE> Flu Surges in UK as Waiting Lists Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The National Health Service (NHS)
waiting lists in Britain have fallen by a record number, according
to figures released on Wednesday by the Royal College of General
Practitioners (RCGP).
</P>
<P>
The figures shows that NHS waiting list for November had
dropped 31,000 against the previous month. The number of people on
NHS waiting lists is now 1,162,100 - down 150,621 from the high
point in April 1998, the RCGP survey says.
</P>
<P>
However, the government's satisfaction at the fall has been
blunted by the news that hospitals across the country are having
to implement emergency measures to deal with the surge in flu
cases.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that the flu bug sweeping the country has
gathered pace, with the number of cases rising by more than 80
percent in a week.
</P>
<P>
The RCGP survey found more than 97,100 people in England and
Wales fell ill with the virus in the last week, compared to around
53,200 in the week before Christmas. The number of infections
reached 185 cases per 100,000 people in the week ending on January
3.
</P>
<P>
Experts admitted the current outbreak of flu still has another
week to run before it reaches the height of its five-week cycle.

LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A glass and a half of wine a day
could help prevent degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's, the New Scientist magazine reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers in Italy have found that a chemical produced by
vines to fight infection and found in grapes and wine, can
increase the activity and effectiveness of Map-kinase, the neural
enzyme which stimulates and regenerates neural cells, by up to
sevenfold.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Bertelli and colleagues at the University of Milan,
Italy, tested resveratrol, the chemical, on human neural cells in
laboratory cultures and found that it made them grow small
extensions through which they could connect with neighboring
cells.
</P>
<P>
This is a key finding since the contacts between some neural
cells are broken in both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, the New
Scientist said.
</P>
<P>
"By daily reinforcing these contacts, we can prevent
neurodegeneration," Bertelli was quoted by the magazine as saying.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Using UNSCOM to Gain Information on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday denied it had got any intelligence information from
UNSCOM officials as the Washington Post alleged in Wednesday's
front page report.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post quoted some U.N. Secretary Geeneral's
confidents as saying that U.N. weapons inspectors had helped
"collect eardropping intelligence used in American efforts to
undermine the Iraqi regime."
</P>
<P>
The Boston Globe had a similar report, which said U.S.
intelligence agents were able to listen to secret communications
between elite military units responsible for Saddam Hussein's
security.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, took steps to assist
the United States in listening to some of the most sensitive
communications of the Baghdad regime ... Washington used the
operation to penetrate the security apparatus protecting Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein," the newspaper continued.
</P>
<P>
In responding to the Washington Post's report, State
Department spokesman James Rubin flatly rejected the accusation.
</P>
<P>
"It is my understanding that at no time did the U.S. work
with anyone at UNSCOM to collect information with the purpose of
undermining the Iraqi regime," Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Rather, the spokesman said, it was the United States that had
given intelligence and logistical help to UNSCOM to help it find
and destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"Our support was specifically tailored to facilitate the
UNSCOM's mission and was done at the direct request of UNSCOM
and for no other purpose," he said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan had
obtained what he regarded as convincing evidence about UNSCOM's
transferring of the intelligence information to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
But Annan's spokesman Fred Eckhard rebuffed the allegations.
</P>
<P>
"We not only have no convincing evidence of these
allegations; we have no evidence of any kind. We have only
rumors. Neither the secretary general nor any member of his
staff has access to classified U.S. intelligence, although
UNSCOM does."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had spoken
to Annan earlier in the day and the secretary general assured
her of his support to UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler and his
work in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> UK Tells Citizens to Leave Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom on Wednesday
condemned rebel attempts to topple the government of Sierra Leone
and urged Britons caught up in the fighting to leave the small
West African country as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn the rebel efforts to overthrow by force the
legitimate government of Sierra Leone and atrocities that they
have committed against innocent civilians," a Foreign Office
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement also read that Foreign Secretary Robin Cook had
been in touch with "key allies" to rally support for the
government of Sierra Leone, which was once a colony of Britain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office used the BBC world service
program to broadcast appeals to those British nationals in the
Sierra Leone capital city of Freetown to get out of the city or
keep their heads down.
</P>
<P>
Rebels attacking the capital seized control of the presidential
state house and other key areas on Wednesday, witnesses said
earlier.
</P>
<P>
All the United Nations personnel, including military observers,
have been pulled out of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office said all British nationals who had wanted to
leave were evacuated over Christmas.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to urge those who remain, who we estimate to
number around 50, to leave as soon as they can safely do so," it
said.
