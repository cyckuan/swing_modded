LAKERS DO INEVITABLE IN FIRING HARRIS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; In these days of change, when the Lakers' nose rings outnumber
their championship rings, isn't it comforting to know they still do
one thing the old-fashioned way?
</P>
<P>
   They fired Del Harris on Wednesday for the oldest reason in the
book.
</P>
<P>
   The team was off to an unimaginably rotten start _ 6-6, tied for
fourth, with !ital!Sacramento _ and, as they've been saying
probably since John Kundla was the Minneapolis Lakers' coach in the
'40s, you can't fire the players.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers finished 1997-98 with a four-and-out playoff loss to
the methodical Utah Jazz that highlighted their weaknesses and set
the bar for their improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Then they showed little evidence of improvement in the first
three weeks of the condensed NBA season. They were humbled again at
the Forum by the Jazz, which used the same pick-and-roll tactics as
last spring. They were outsmarted at the end of a tight game at the
Forum by the Indiana Pacers, a veteran team with a Jazz
resemblance. They were 0-4 against teams with winning records at
tipoff, and then they lost back-to-back to hapless Denver and
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents had been saying things like this, from Indiana's
Antonio Davis: ``I think they just need to learn to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Lakers are talented but would need time to
acquire the intelligence and !tal!esprit de corps to get over the
Utah hump.
</P>
<P>
   Unless . . . you thought the coach was at fault for failing to
drum those qualities into them. Which, it developed, Lakers vice
president Jerry West or owner Jerry Buss or both determined to be
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Bill Bertka is in charge for tonight's game
against the Clippers at The Pond, or until the front office chooses
between assistants Kurt Rambis and Larry Drew, or until Phil
Jackson can hop a plane.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fifth Lakers season for Harris, 61. His most
impressive accomplishment was coaxing higher regular-season win
totals out of the team in each of the first four. His most damning
failure was finishing second or third in the Pacific Division each
time and never reaching the NBA final.
</P>
<P>
   The departure last summer of the team's most divisive figure,
point guard Nick Van Exel, inspired visions of Aquarian harmony in
the locker room and a breakthrough year for the young Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when they lost three straight this week _ an embarrassment
mitigated only a bit by the fact they were playing the first
all-on-the-road back-to-back-to-back games by an NBA team in Kobe
Bryant's lifetime _ Lakers players cited a continued lack of
chemistry as a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to, I guess, point the finger at somebody,'' forward
Corey Blount said after the firing. ``I guess it was just time for
a change. To me you can't put all the blame on the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   But coaching is a bottom-line business and Harris was headed for
a 14th season as an NBA head coach without a division title to his
credit.
</P>
<P>
   And he walked a short plank to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   By declining to extend his contract, which runs out in June,
Lakers executives signaled that Harris hadn't accomplished what
they'd hoped and perhaps never would. He began the season as a
gimpy, if not lame, duck.
</P>
<P>
   A calm and courtly man, holder of degrees in religion and
history, noted for painstakingly precise speech, Harris never
played basketball after Milligan College in Tennessee, making it
harder to connect with NBA players who appreciate war wounds.
</P>
<P>
   When Lakers players needed somebody to light a fire under them,
Harris had the look of a wet match.
</P>
<P>
   His firing _ sooner, later or at the end of the season _ seemed
as inevitable as a Lakers losing streak under the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   They've played a hard schedule _ already facing Utah, Indiana,
San Antonio and Seattle in the first 10 games. They've played every
game but one with a predicted opening-night starter in street
clothes for health reasons _ Robert Horry, Shaquille O'Neal and/or
Rick Fox.
</P>
<P>
   They might just miss Van Exel more than they expected,
especially in light of third-year point guard Derek Fisher's crisis
of confidence, brought on by playing fewer minutes than Derek
Harper most nights and then getting benched.
</P>
<P>
   Their offense continues to run one direction _ through O'Neal,
who has led the Lakers scoring in every game he has played.
</P>
<P>
   And they've spent the month trying to figure out what's more
distracting _ the Dennis Rodman contract circus or having to deny
it's a distraction over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those problems are Del Harris' fault, some aren't.
Whatever, it was time for a change.
</P>
<P>
   Change usually doesn't mean signing a guy with nose rings. But
it always means firing the coach.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Bill Spiers is regarded as a jack-of-all-trades
player who can help his team in just about any capacity imaginable.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the trait that often goes unnoticed is an unselfish approach
that makes Spiers the ultimate team player. Sure, he can play every
position on the diamond with the exception of pitcher and catcher _
and that may be only because no one has asked him _ but Spiers also
has the rare ability to swallow his pride and act in the best
interests of the team.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it might have appeared Spiers was pushed into
the background when the Astros signed free-agent third baseman Ken
Caminiti. But Spiers was one of the people working behind the
scenes to pave Caminiti's way back to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Spiers and Caminiti never have been teammates prior to this
season, but they share common friends in Jeff Bagwell and Craig
Biggio. Caminiti was well aware of how highly Spiers is regarded in
the Astros' clubhouse, and the last thing he wanted to do was
ruffle feathers unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people probably thought this caught me off-guard, but
it really didn't,'' Spiers said. ``Before Cammy signed, he called
me and asked how I would feel about him coming to the Astros, and I
told him I'd love to have him as a teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten to know him through some of the other guys on the
team, and I know he can help us. That's really the only thing that
matters. To me, you can't get caught up in worrying about a lot of
other stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know I'd rather have him on the team than not have him.
He makes us better, and I've always dreamed of being on a team like
this. He has a personality that fits right in with our club. I was
all for it.''
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, Caminiti would have signed with the Astros
regardless of Spiers' response, but the fact he asked is an
indication of how Spiers is regarded by his peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the utmost respect for Billy Spiers,'' Caminiti said.
``I just felt like I should ask him about it as a courtesy. I
didn't want to step on anybody's feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Caminiti's signing made the Astros a better overall
team, it raised all sorts of questions regarding Spiers' role. For
the past two seasons, Spiers shared third base with Sean Berry, but
it's safe to say Caminiti will get a large majority of the playing
time at third base in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spiers is Mr. Versatility,'' Astros general manager Gerry
Hunsicker said. ``He can play every position on the infield, and
he'll most likely be our top lefthanded pinch hitter off the bench.
I'm not sure (manager) Larry (Dierker) would be opposed to running
him out to the outfield every now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   The outfield? Now, there's an intriguing possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, Richard Hidalgo is the starting left fielder
now that Moises Alou is likely out for the season. But the Astros
are exploring all of their options with regard to outfield depth,
and Spiers might figure into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only played a few innings in the outfield since I've been
in the big leagues,'' said Spiers, who has a .283 batting average
in his three seasons with the Astros. ``But I'm willing to leave
that possibility open.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that type of attitude that makes Spiers one of Hunsicker's
most cherished acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Spiers is the consummate team player,'' said Hunsicker,
who signed Spiers as a free agent in 1996. ``He has no problem
putting the team before himself. In my mind, he's going to be just
as important to our team as he has been the past two seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiers is likely to get the bulk of his playing time at
shortstop, depending on how he plays the position during the
spring. The 32-year-old former first-round pick of the Milwaukee
Brewers broke into the big leagues as a shortstop in 1989, but
there is some concern about his range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shortstop is going to be the key to his playing time,''
Hunsicker said. ``If, in fact, Dierk has the confidence to put him
there, that's another real option.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what the higher-ups decide, Spiers seems willing
to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to win, and I want what's best for the team,'' he
said. ``Somehow, some way, I know I'm going to get my
opportunities.''

HARRIS' DEMISE INEVITABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the more dramatic 24-hour periods in the history of
the Los Angeles Lakers, the team Wednesday hired a wacky Generation
X cult figure, Dennis Rodman, and fired their 61-year-old coach,
avuncular-looking Del Harris.
</P>
<P>
   The two monumental events are unrelated, but they do reflect a
restlessness and impatience uncommon to a revered Southern
California athletic team whose hallmark throughout the seasons has
been its stability. The gentleman who pulled the trigger on both
decisions, Jerry Buss, owner of the Lakers, is not a man given to
such intemperate deportment, having hitherto run a well-respected
franchise that has won five NBA championships since he bought it
from Jack Kent Cooke in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Buss only twice before has a detached a coach during a
season, with the first coming on Nov. 19, 1981, when he replaced
Paul Westhead with Chick Hearn's radio partner, fellow named Pat
Riley. The second time came on March 23, 1994, when Magic Johnson
took over for Randy Pfund.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that Buss finally came to the conclusion that his
vice-president of basketball operations, Jerry West, came to in the
middle of last season that Del Harris wasn't the proper fit for
this Laker team.
</P>
<P>
   Buss ignored West's advice to get rid of Harris then, and also
ignored West's advice to get rid of Harris in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   But, apparently, Buss had a drastic change of heart after
watching his wealthy, underachieving Laker players Shaquille O'Neal
alone earns $16 million a season lose back-to-back road games this
week to the lowly Denver Nuggets and Vancouver Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   Many Laker players long had been voicing off-the-record
misgivings about Harris, despising his slow-motion,
pitch-the-ball-into-Shaq attack, abhorring his unpredictable
substituting patterns, hating his constant chattering at practices
and during games, just plain loathing him as their leader.
</P>
<P>
   The grumbling from people like O'Neal and Kobe Bryant had
reportedly reached a reverberating crescendo in recent days with
the team performing below expectations during a 6-6 start in this
abbreviated NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' long-time assistant coach, Bill Bertka, 71, will
assume the head coaching duties for the team's game tonight against
the Los Angeles Clippers at the Pond, but Laker sources say another
assistant, Kurt Rambis, is Buss' top choice to permanently succeed
Harris. Larry Drew, another Laker assistant, also has been
mentioned as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The question now being asked by many observers keen to Laker
goings-on is not why Jerry Buss fired Del Harris, but, instead, why
he didn't fire him a year ago, when Jerry West recommended he do
so.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time that Buss unfailingly listened to West, but
that no longer appears to be the case, with the signing of Rodman
the latest example of Buss' defiance toward West.
</P>
<P>
   West was the architect of the mighty Lakers' Showtime dynasty of
the 1980s, and one of its enduring legacies was its remarkable
avoidance of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   It was West's policy to stock the Laker roster with solid
citizen types who preferred spending more time in gyms than in
gambling casinos, tattoo parlors, hair salons, etc. There were a
few bumps along the way James Worthy being nabbed for soliciting a
prostitute in Houston being the most notable exception but Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Byron Scott, Michael Cooper, Jamaal
Wilkes and the others usually got their names mentioned by the
media for their basketball heroics, not for claiming to sleep with
Madonna, or for coloring their hair, or for festooning their bodies
with tattoos, or their faces with rings.
</P>
<P>
   West always has shied away from players carrying heavy baggage,
and it would take a couple Fed-X jets to haul around all the
luggage Dennis Rodman brings with him to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   As do all people in their later years, especially rich ones
nearing 70, Jerry Buss has changed, and the impact of such a
metamorphosis already has been negatively felt by the Lakers when
Buss nixed an Eddie Jones-for-Mitch Richmond trade that West had
made a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see what will develop in the upcoming
weeks from Buss' risk-laden acquisition of Rodman, although the
feeling here is that a Laker turnabout will take more than adding
Rodman and subtracting Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it about time the Lakers go out and locate a legitimate
point guard and dump those two impersonators who've been laughably
playing the position, Messrs. Derek Fisher and Derek Harper?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it about time someone informs their 20-year-old prodigy,
Kobe Bryant, that he isn't Michael Jordan, will never be Michael
Jordan, and that he should stop gunning and making foolish passes
and just start learning how to become a team player like, say,
Michael Jordan was?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it about time someone tells Shaquille O'Neal that there is
more to playing basketball than dunking it, and that one of his
noble predecessors, Wilt Chamberlain, to this day has been unable
to live down his deserved image as a loser because he performed in
the same I-want-to-score-my-points,
the-heck-with-getting-down-on-defense style throughout so much of
his career?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it about time the Lakers either trade Elden Campbell and
Eddie Jones, or send them to Kosovo to do peace monitoring duties
for NATO, or at least desist with their policy of letting them
dangle haplessly from the precipice?
</P>
<P>
   Now that Del Harris follows Paul Westhead and Randy Pfund into
Laker coaching oblivion, is this team that has stumbled so
erratically set to rebound under the guidance of a new coach as it
did 18 years ago, when it won 17 of its first 20 games under Pat
Riley?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Laker players, who had grown to detest Harris even
though the past three years he had led them to 170 regular season
victories, will emerge from their season-long funk under the new
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Derek Harper or Derek Fisher will start doing what the
departed Nick Van Exel was able to do on occasion when a game was
on the line make big plays.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Shaquille O'Neal will start blocking more shots and making
more of his free throws and maybe Kobe Bryant will start displaying
more discipline and shooting accuracy and maybe Eddie Jones finally
can find consistency and Elden Campbell can find passion.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe Kurt Rambis, or Larry Drew, or both can inspire these
Lakers to heights they never were able to reach under Harris, a
nice man who found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time
with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, and maybe Dennis Rodman will not create a tense locker
room atmosphere with his zany antics, and maybe I one day will be
mistaken for Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   There may not have been a coach in the NBA who knew more about
X's and O's than Del Harris, but such clinical knowledge seemed
quite irrelevant on a young, spoiled Laker team comprised of
players who simply couldn't relate to a silver-haired coach from
another era.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Buss was left with no alternative, in light of the Lakers'
unpromising beginning and hatred of Harris.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't fire O'Neal or Bryant, or any of the others. So Del
Harris had to go even though his departure doesn't figure to make
that much difference on a team that still has too many open wounds
festering on it.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Carroll Dawson, the Rockets' executive vice president of
basketball, stood in the tunnel leading to the Compaq Center court
last week, watching his players blow out the Phoenix Suns.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A passer-by jutted a thumb toward the court and said, ``That's
one heck of a team you have there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawson nodded but couldn't resist the obvious reply: ``The team
we have in the training room isn't bad, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, how else to best sum up the Rockets' season so far?
</P>
<P>
   Forgotten amid an interminable road trip and agonizing schedule
is the fact the Rockets have managed to keep their heads above
water, taking a 7-4 record into tonight's home game against the
Atlanta Hawks while playing without four of their key players.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley, Antoine Carr, Rodrick Rhodes and Stanley
Roberts, all of whom are expected to play big roles in any
championship drive, have been out with injuries for much or all of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   But the trainer's-room All-Stars are almost ready to return.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes and Carr participated in their first real basketball
workouts Wednesday, and both are lobbying for a quick return to the
roster, perhaps as soon as tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Relief, at last, for Rudy Tomjanovich and his coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to push the issue (of returning to the lineup)
now,'' said Rhodes, who had been out after undergoing surgery to
repair a torn right pectoral tendon. ``I took some licks on my
shoulder, and it didn't hurt it at all. I took some real good pops
today. I don't know how they (the coaches) feel, but I want to
start playing again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited, and I'm just happy that this is over with my
chest. It was frustrating. I was getting tired of just not doing
anything. I want to get back, and I don't care what they think or
what the doctors say, my chest is fine now.''
</P>
<P>
   As is Carr's right knee, which underwent arthroscopic surgery to
repair an ``acute chondral injury'' on Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great being able to get back on the floor,'' Carr
said. ``I finally got some banging in. I just have to keep going
from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr, like Rhodes, said he wants to return as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully within the next few games,'' said Carr. ``I just
have to keep working and get my aerobic conditioning back up, since
I wasn't able to do much (conditioning work) with the knee. Other
than that, I'm ready to bang.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley reiterated that he wants to be back for either Sunday's
game in Los Angeles against the Lakers or Tuesday's home game
against the San Antonio Spurs. He went through his first hard
workout since undergoing surgery to repair torn cartilage in his
left knee and will go through another tough workout today.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I originally got hurt, we said that I would be back in
two to three weeks,'' Barkley said. ``Hopefully, it will go well
for me (today) when I have the big test. It's going to be sore for
a couple of weeks, but I'm going to try and do a lot more (today)
and see how it goes. Worst-case scenario, it will be Tuesday (when
he returns).''
</P>
<P>
   And Barkley, like the others, intends to return full-force.
There will be no easing back into the grind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't play sports like that,'' Barkley said. ``You either
go out there and play hard the whole time, or you shouldn't be out
there. If you have to pace yourself, you can't play.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dangerous to go out there when you're taking a little bit
off,'' he said. ``A lot of times, that's when you get hurt. I think
you have to play your natural game, whatever that is. It seems to
work better that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said he hasn't had any of the players come to him
and demand to be put back in the rotation, even though he
understands they might be getting antsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been put in that position yet,'' Tomjanovich said.
``Today is like a test day for Antoine, going contact right now,
and Charles still hasn't had any contact. But he (Barkley) is
always whispering in my ear, `I'm just about there, coach.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to what the doctors say _ that's their field. We'll
see how it goes. We want to keep our focus on the big picture, and
that's being ready at the end, when it really counts _ in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich has been busy trying to draw up a game plan that
will best take advantage of what new starters Scottie Pippen,
Michael Dickerson and Cuttino Mobley bring to the team. And having
all these players coming in at roughly the same time will make that
job even more taxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a lot of guys close to coming back,''
Tomjanovich said. ``We've got to be patient and get them in
physically but also the mental part. We're still changing things
and trying to find out what's best for this personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a transition _ what plays are best for these
new guys? We have three new guys in the starting lineup, so we're
looking at a lot of different things. And our guys have been very
patient. Hopefully, we'll hit on some basic sets and basic tactics
that everybody will be comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody'' is exactly right with this team. After all the
injuries, the Rockets find themselves with a roster full of guys
who are ready _ and able _ to contribute to a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people forget that we're 12 deep,'' Carr
said. ``We have a lot of good players. A lot of guys can do other
things, and we're going to have to use all of that. But the four
guys that were out are definitely guys that can make a
difference.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A three-game win streak and being two games above
.500 might not sound like much, but it tells the Cal State
Northridge baseball team it's starting to do things right.
</P>
<P>
   By beating UCLA 10-4 Wednesday at Matador Field, Northridge
(11-9) moved to higher ground than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three in a row,'' second baseman Kevin Patrick said. ``And we
took two of three from Washington, and now we beat UCLA, so that's
three out of four against the Pac-10.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, that might not seem major, but wins now against major
Division I teams are crucial. Northridge is an independent and
needs a solid record against top-level teams to earn a postseason
berth.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, a win like Wednesday's, in which the Matadors put
together as balanced an effort as they have had all season, is
critical now because of the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's home game with Loyola Marymount, Northridge has
just 10 more home games out of 35. It started the season with 18 of
21 home games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had better have it together once you go on the road,''
Northridge coach Mike Batesole said. ``There's not an easy Division
I win on the road. You'd better come together as a club.''
</P>
<P>
   Northridge isn't completely there yet, but Wednesday showed it
was closer. Seven batters got hits, led by Chatsworth graduate Dan
Phillips' 4-for-5 day with a double and a three-run home run in the
seventh inning that turned a 6-4 lead into a rout.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick followed Phillips with his own home run.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge also came through with the bases loaded. Eric Horvat
hit a sacrifice fly and Jason Gorman hit a two-run single in the
fifth, and Matt Synhorst drove in two in the seventh. His hit,
against Chaminade graduate Tyler Derson, gave the Matadors the lead
for good.
</P>
<P>
   Also, four pitchers held UCLA (8-11) to eight hits. Garrett
Atkins and Chase Utley combined for five hits and scored two runs
apiece, but two players don't usually make an offense win.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Sanchez (3-1), the team's third pitcher, got the win with
one scoreless inning. Ryan Carter (0-4) took the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge,'' Phillips said. ``We need the momentum. We're
going on the road a lot. The more momentum, the better. We're
starting to work together. The pitching is complementing the
hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA took the loss hard. For an hour after the final out, the
Bruins met, then ran in the outfield (coach Gary Adams included),
performed diving and baserunning drills, sprinted and met some
more.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have battled inconsistency throughout the season.
They often fall behind and then come back, sometimes winning and
sometimes falling short. There was no comeback this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I don't like surprises,'' Adams said. ``We put
together a great game against San Diego State, then an off game
against Texas Tech. Then a great game against Loyola and now
this.''

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
WACO _ Texas coach Rick Barnes inherited a team in turmoil and
watched his players lose seven of their first nine games this
season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That difficult transition must have seemed like a distant memory
Wednesday night when the Longhorns clinched the Big 12
regular-season championship, capping one of the most amazing
turnarounds in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Texas easily defeated hapless Baylor 62-52 at the Ferrell Center
in a game that displayed two teams at opposite ends of the
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   The 22nd-ranked Longhorns (18-10, 13-2 Big 12) claimed their
first outright conference championship since the 1993-94 Southwest
Conference season. The Longhorns were co-SWC champs with Texas Tech
in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win a regular-season championship, you have to have mental
toughness, and you have to have discipline over a two-month
period,'' Barnes said. ``It says a lot about these players. I think
what meant the most to me tonight was the support of our fans. They
came up here and let our players know how much they appreciate what
the team has done.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 5,711, most of whom were UT fans, made it seem like
a home game for the Longhorns. Late in the second half, the Texas
fans began chanting ``Big 12 champs'' and did it again when the
players stood in front of them after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has won eight of its last nine games and 14 of its last
16. Baylor (6-22, 0-15), on the other hand, is one loss away from
becoming the first Big 12 team to go winless in league play.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Clack led the Longhorns with 21 points, and Nnadubem
``Gabe'' Muoneke added 16. Center Chris Mihm had his 15th double
double of the season, amassing 12 rebounds, 10 points and five
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so exciting for us,'' Muoneke said. ``I'm just so
happy that coach Barnes came here and did what he did. Now, we want
to win the Big 12 Tournament and put all the doubters to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear early in Wednesday's game that Baylor wasn't going
to challenge the Longhorns. Texas led 34-17 at the half after
holding the Bears to 31.6-percent shooting (6-of-19) and
outrebounding Baylor 19-12 in the first 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Texas had its biggest lead at 40-19 after a baseline jumper by
Clack with 16:30 to go. Baylor never made a serious run, but the
Bears cut an 18-point deficit to 10 in the final three minutes.
Baylor forward Jamie Kendrick was the top scorer with 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has come a long way,'' said Baylor coach Harry Miller.
``They are a tough outfit that is well-coached. If they continue to
get a little perimeter shooting, they are going to be tough to deal
with.''
</P>
<P>
   While Barnes is headed for conference Coach of the Year honors,
Miller's time at Baylor might be coming to an end. There have been
rumors and speculation for weeks that Baylor will have a new
basketball coach next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a tough year, but all the guys have continued to
play hard,'' Miller said. ``I just hope we can play a few games in
the (Big 12) tournament and go out on a good note.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas has one league game left, a home date with Missouri on
Saturday. Regardless of the outcome, the 'Horns will be the top
seed in the Big 12 Tournament, which begins a week from today in
Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   UT will have a bye in the first round before playing at noon
March 5 against the winner of a first-round matchup. Baylor will be
the 12th seed and play at 2:20 p.m. March 4 against the No. 5 seed.
</P>
<P>
   Having a bye in the opening round should be beneficial to a
Texas team that rarely uses more than eight players. It has been an
amazing season for the Longhorns, who were 4-8 when conference play
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came back from LSU (at 2-7), that's when we decided to
become a team,'' Barnes said. ``Everyone put his ego aside, and the
chemistry started to click. Each person truly evaluated what he
could bring to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes took over a team in disarray after Tom Penders was fired
last spring because of a players revolt. Two key players _ shooting
guard Luke Axtell and point guard Bernard Smith _ transferred to
other schools. When it was all settled, Barnes was left with only
eight scholarship players, and he lost one of those _ backup center
Marlon Drakes _ to a broken foot early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes also was making a 180-degree change from the style of
play Texas used under Penders, going from a run-and-gun,
offensive-minded team to an aggressive, half-court defensive team
with a structured offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I wanted them to become one of the best half-court
defensive teams in the country, and I wanted them to prepare hard
in practice,'' Barnes said. ``We committed to a style of play,
locked in on it and went to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to develop better habits, and it took some time. I told
them there are many seasons within a season. First preseason, then
came our trip to Hawaii, then conference. The Big 12 Tournament
will be a new life, and postseason will be another. This is not a
sprint; it's a marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   Clack said the players never lost faith in what Barnes was
trying to teach them early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a matter of putting it together as a team,'' Clack
said. ``We stayed positive, and we knew we had the players to do
it. We are looking for bigger and better things now.''

   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA freshman center Dan Gadzuric suffered a
potentially season-ending injury to his left knee Wednesday in
practice. Gadzuric had an MRI exam Wednesday night, and the results
are expected today. UCLA officials believe he may have torn the
meniscus cartilage in the knee. Gadzuric is doubtful for tonight's
game against Washington State and questionable for the remainder of
the season. Gadzuric is averaging 8.6 points and 5.7 rebounds per
game.

   NY-DOG-CONTROL (New York) _ Dog wars: a chronic conflict made
worse by a fashion among New Yorkers to own bigger, stronger, more

dragging their owners (or paid walkers) to city parks. So to
preserve Central Park and especially Riverside Park, the city has
announced stiffer fines and increased enforcement. By getting tough
on free-range dogs _ an echo of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's

percentage points. Many other hedge funds did poorly in 1998. But
this is not just another hedge fund. Cramer-Berkowitz manages about
$300 million on behalf of elite investors who pony up at least $2.5
million each to become partners in the all-star fund, known for its

the pages of Traditional Home magazine. But what's that green,

   NC-DAY-MUSEUM (Milton, N.C.) _ Nearly 10 years after a brush
fire reduced the historic Union Tavern to a roofless shell, a
determined committee is slowly raising money to repair it and
convert it into a museum devoted to Thomas Day, a black
cabinetmaker who worked here before the Civil War. Born free in
Virginia in 1801, Day walked a precarious line all his life.
Despite laws limiting the rights of free blacks, he established a
successful business in North Carolina, owned stock in a local bank,
trained white apprentices (and owned black slaves, himself), and
numbered among his customers North Carolina's most prominent
citizens, including the Governor, David S. Reid. By Liz Seymour.

Territorial Seed Co., has no idea if the millennium bug, aka Y2K,
is ``overblown fiction or a real problem.'' But that did not stop
him from warning about possible Y2K disruptions in the catalogue
that Territorial recently mailed to 650,000 gardeners. By Barnaby
J. Feder.

   LOS ANGELES _ Aimee Copp sits up in bed, her eyes focused
straight ahead. She knows something terrible is about to happen.
Panic and fear overtake her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to die right now,'' she thinks.
</P>
<P>
   Her vision narrows. She hears everything in echo. One by one,
she loses her senses. Then everything goes black and Copp falls
unconscious for between 20 and 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For the last seven years, Copp, now a USC basketball player, has
lived with epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She deals withit every day,'' USC coach Chris Gobrecht said.
``It's a real part of her life. She is able to play with it and it
doesn't endanger her.''
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about epilepsy, or seizure disorder. It can be
linked to heredity, head injury, brain tumor or infection, or
chemical imbalances. Seizures can happen several times a day _ at
any time of day or night _ or once every few years. Some people
receive visual warnings (auras) and some don't. There also are
several types of seizures.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms aren't the only things Copp fights. Ignorance is
just as formidable an opponent. At Fullerton High, her teachers and
peers couldn't understand why she was out of school all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see how strong and fit I look. They just can't believe
it,'' Copp said. ``Some think, `Oh, no big deal.' Some think you're
retarded. Some think, `Do you have to wear a helmet?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her sophomore year in high school was her most difficult time.
She spent so much time out of school as doctors tried to determine
the cause of the seizures and the proper medication to control them
that she couldn't pass her classes.
</P>
<P>
   When she was in class, she often suffered absence seizures, in
which she would be unable to process information for between three
and seven seconds. To her peers and teachers, it appeared she
wasn't paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Her principal told her she wouldn't graduate with her class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very emotional,'' Copp said. ``I'd start crying.''
</P>
<P>
   The family struggled, too. At first her parents thought she was
having nightmares _ until the parents of a friend with whom Copp
stayed overnight called them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aimee was in a catatonic state and there was a lot of blood
(from) a loose tooth,'' Phyllis Copp said. ``When we got there, she
didn't respond. It was frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Also frightening for Aimee was the loss of her athletic career.
She loved soccer and tried to stay with it for a year.
</P>
<P>
   For much of her sophomore year, different doctors prescribed
different medicines to combat her seizures, all to no avail. But by
the summer of her junior year _ after being told this was how she
would have to live _ she switched doctors again. This group of
doctors wanted to try something different: Find the exact location
of the seizure in the brain. That meant hospitalization, going off
medication and enduring at least three more seizures.
</P>
<P>
   She found herself with about 50 wires hooked to her head and to
a camera that would record her every move. Seven doctors watched
three seizures over three weeks before finding the location on the
left side of her brain, where controls for speech, language and
memory are located.
</P>
<P>
   They put Copp on a third type of medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that point on, I had a new life,'' Aimee said.
</P>
<P>
   She resumed her life. She attended class and even took night
school to catch up. She finally got her driver's license. She
joined her school's tennis, track and basketball teams. She
graduated with her class.
</P>
<P>
   It was basketball that she really grew to love and wanted to
play in college, but since she hadn't played it long enough, she
felt the junior college route would work. At Fullerton College, she
made the All-State team and helped the school finish 27-9 and reach
the state quarterfinals last year. Her 334 rebounds established a
school record and helped attract USC's attention.
</P>
<P>
   This season has been difficult for Copp. She has been slow to
adjust to the Division I game, averaging two points and one rebound
a game in 8.9 minutes. Not becoming eligible for USC until Dec. 29,
the result of a transcript snafu at Fullerton, didn't help, either.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she was seizure-free for five years. Until . . .
</P>
<P>
   She returned to her apartment from the grocery store one weekend
late last year and felt that same sense of dread.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I remember is my head jacking two times to the right,''
she said. ``I woke up in a dark room. I'm hyperventilating. My
first thought was `I have to get out of here.' I tried to get up,
fell and hit my head. I looked in the mirror (the sliding-glass
closet door in her bedroom). My face was covered in blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get up again and couldn't, so I laid there shaking.
I crawled to the desk in my room. I crawled to the phone. It took
five to 10 minutes. I picked up the phone and called Mom. My speech
was slurred.''
</P>
<P>
   She lost her license and her medication dosage increased from
three to four times a day. She hasn't had another seizure since.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a heartbreak every time it starts again,'' Phyllis said.
``She wants to appear strong and not be different than anyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Copp has.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very inspirational and she's very open about it,''
Gobrecht said.

DUNN GETS TOP FUEL INSPIRATION FROM GWYNN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Mike Dunn had listened to his father, he wouldn't be driving
a Top Fuel dragster today.
</P>
<P>
   If Dunn had given in to his critics, he would have called it
quits during winless 1997 and 1998 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a grinning Dunn graces the cover of the current issue
of ``National Dragster'' as owner of the national elapsed-time
record and winner of the prestigious NHRA Winternationals.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn got all that done during the rain-plagued season opener at
Pomona Raceway in California. He collected every point available
under National Hot Rod Association rules and earned overdue
recognition for himself and inspirational team owner Darrell Gwynn.
Dunn heads into the NHRA event at Firebird International Raceway
this weekend in Phoenix as the Top Fuel points leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had set the national elapsed-time record, and I've
been doing this for 18 years,'' said Dunn, 42, who earned the No. 1
qualifying spot by covering Pomona's quarter-mile in 4.503 seconds.
That ET became the record when it was backed up by a first-round
pass in 4.513 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Those are message-sending numbers by Dunn, runner-up to Gary
Scelzi at four races last year. Three of those final-round defeats
came in consecutive national events in midsummer, and helped propel
Scelzi to his second Winston Top Fuel title.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn finished fifth in points in 1998, the sixth season in which
he has placed in the Top Fuel top 10. During the off-season,
however, Dunn said Gwynn and tuner Ken Veney decided they were
going to stop racing the Team Mopar car like also-rans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darrell's always talking about going to the next level. That
competitive spirit has never died in him,'' Dunn said of Gwynn, 36,
whose Top Fuel driving career ended when he was paralyzed in a
crash on Easter Sunday 1990 in England. ``All you \Rmedia\S guys
talk about is Scelzi and Cory McClenathan and Kenny Bernstein and
Joe Amato. Now we hope that you're going to mention us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn's love affair with drag racing was sparked by his father,
Jim, a pioneer match-racer from Southern California in the 1970s
and subject of the classic movie ``Funny Car Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My father never encouraged me to do this,'' Dunn said. ``He
was a fireman and did it as a hobby on the weekends. He never
really thought you could make a living at it. But like most kids, I
never listened to my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn was a part-time Top Fuel shoe in 1993 when he joined Gwynn,
who motors around the pits in a wheelchair. Through the trying
times since their last victory in 1996, it is Gwynn who has emerged
as Dunn's everyday hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``And don't get me wrong, because we do argue,'' Dunn said.
``Darrell, since I've been with him, has never complained about the
cards he's been dealt. When I'm not winning a race, I've got no
right to complain. There's going to be another race in two weeks.
He can't \Rdrive\S and he's not complaining. That has helped me out
immensely in my career. I think it's helped me mature.''
SPOTLIGHT ON... Arie Luyendyk LUYENDYK EXIT MAY FOIL TEXAS MOTOR
SPEEDWAY
</P>
<P>
   Arie Luyendyk's intention to retire after running the 83rd
Indianapolis 500 on May 30 presents a potentially sticky marketing
situation at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   As in, what if Luyendyk wins The Greatest Spectacle in Racing?
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Gossage, executive vice president and general manager of
TMS, has promoted and built the Pep Boys Indy Racing League event
in Fort Worth on two premises the past two Junes _ as the first
nighttime Indy-car race in modern history, and as the first
appearance of the new Indy 500 champion since the victory at
Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   If Luyendyk wins his third Indy 500 and hangs up his helmet,
Gossage will have to come up with another ticket-selling hook.
</P>
<P>
   Or will he?
</P>
<P>
   ``You better believe I'll be talking to Arie in Victory Lane at
Indianapolis, threatening him if necessary,'' Gossage said
good-naturedly Tuesday. Earlier, Luyendyk had unveiled the No. 5
Sprint PCS G Force/Aurora he will drive for car owner Fred
Treadway, and a commemorative ``Arie's Final 500'' logo during a
news conference at the Speedway Hall of Fame Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-year-old Dutchman reiterated that his decision to run
Indy and retire is firm. The Longhorn 500K on June 12 will have to
go on without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made up my mind this is my final race,'' Luyendyk said. ``I
put all my thought into it at the end of last year. My wife
\RMieke\S said it best: `Even when you're 60 you'll still have the
urge to drive a race car.' Well, I'm 45 and I'm going to end my
career here. A lot of athletes have retired and somebody throws a
lot of money at them \Rto return\S. But if I win at Indy, that will
be the ultimate and perfect way to end my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk carved his place in motorsports history with Indy 500
victories in 1990 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The latter victory was followed by the inaugural and
controversial True Value 500K at TMS on June 6, 1997. The race was
plagued by a series of electronic scoring glitches, and when Billy
Boat was declared the winner, Luyendyk crashed the party in Victory
Lane to protest that he had won. Luyendyk was promptly slapped
upside the head and knocked to the ground by car owner A.J. Foyt in
what has become one of TMS' signature moments.
</P>
<P>
   After an overnight audit by the U.S. Auto Club, Luyendyk was
declared the winner the next day. Foyt, however, has stubbornly
refused to return the trophy. Gossage has awarded Luyendyk a copy
of the original hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if Arie comes to Texas, I'll go get him the real trophy
from A.J.'s office,'' said Gossage, who added that he sincerely
hopes Luyendyk runs the race of his life this May.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about a guy that has won two Indy 500s, the
first IRL race at Texas, and he's been a personal friend for better
than 15 years,'' Gossage said. ``But I'll do what I've got to do to
twist his arm to convince him he really needs to come to Texas.
After all, the Indy 500 is just a warm-up for the Longhorn 500.''

QUICK HITS RATINGS SAVED ``THE ROCK''
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of empty seats Sunday on the windy backstretch
at North Carolina Speedway, and now we know where many of those
missing fans were.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sitting outside in 40-degree weather in Rockingham,
N.C., the fans apparently were among those at home watching on TNN.
The Nashville Network earned a 6.2 national cable rating for its
telecast of the Dura-Lube/Big Kmart 400. The rating was up 10
percent from last year's 5.6, according to Nielsen Media Research.
The 4,524,000 households are also a record for NASCAR Winston Cup
coverage on cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   Given the unsettled weather in the Carolinas in February,
perhaps NASCAR ought to consider date-swapping next year. For
instance, why not take the week after the Daytona 500 off to give
the champion a chance to make the talk-show circuit, etc., and to
allow teams to regroup. Race No. 2 could be at Texas Motor
Speedway, followed by a trip to Las Vegas for hopefully more nice
weather. Then head back to North Carolina Speedway and Atlanta
Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Because, other than the weather, it does not make sense for the
same series that drew an estimated 195,000 fans at Daytona on Feb.
14 to perform before 45,000 at ``The Rock'' one week later.
CUP TEAMS BOOK TMS TESTS
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR teams will begin descending on Texas Motor Speedway next
week for testing leading to the Coca-Cola 300 Busch Grand National
and Primestar 500 Winston Cup races March 27-28.
</P>
<P>
   Testing begins Monday and Tuesday, when Team Sabco's Sterling
Marlin and Joe Nemechek are scheduled to be joined by two-time
Winston Cup champion Terry Labonte of Hendrick Motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time Busch Grand National champion Randy LaJoie, the current
points leader, will attend the session to shake down the Cup car he
plans to run in five events this season beginning at TMS. The car
is owned by Cup regular Ernie Irvan and Trans-Am racer Mark Semo.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Irwin Jr., the 1998 Cup rookie of the year, is also
tentatively scheduled to test the Busch car owned by Cup star Dale
Jarrett and Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre. Irwin will
debut the No. 11 Ford in the Coca-Cola 300.
</P>
<P>
   The tests are closed to the public.
AERO PACKAGE ENDORSED
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Cup race featured 25 lead changes among six drivers _
and that rates as an endorsement of NASCAR's revised rear spoiler
and front air dam rules.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the lead-swapping, there was plenty of
side-by-side racing around the tight, 1.017-mile oval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it definitely made the racing a lot better,'' said
Ford driver Dale Jarrett, who finished second to Mark Martin's
Taurus. ``We could go in the corner side-by-side and not feel like
we were gonna spin out or slide up and get loose and get in the
other guy. I think that we'll see even better racing as we go to
some racetracks where the tires don't wear quite as quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett was likely referring to the series' next stop, at the
1.5-mile Las Vegas Motor Speedway on March 7. Bruton Smith's most
recent acquisition features a smooth surface and flat, wide,
12-degree banked turns that put a premium on downforce. In other
words, it's a Taurus track.
LAST WORDS
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't feel sorry for nobody in this sport, because those
suckers will stomp right on you. When you're down, that's good
because they don't have so far to kick you.''
</P>
<P>

Cup Series

TEXAS TOPS BAYLOR, GRABS BIG 12 TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
WACO, Texas _ A team that turned for the better on Hawaiian shores
in December became the best in the Big 12 last night on the banks
of the Brazos River. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas, which stood 2-7 when it embarked for a post-Christmas
tournament in Honolulu, Hawaii, won for the 14th time in 16 games
and clinched the Big 12 conference championship with 62-52 victory
over Baylor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Texas, 18-10 overall and 13-2 in the Big 12 with a home game
remaining at home Saturday against Missouri, also captured the No.
1 seed in next week's Big 12 tournament. The Longhorns became the
first team other than Kansas to win a regular-season title in the
three-year-old conference. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Words can hardly explain it,'' said forward Gabe Muoneke, who
had 16 points and seven rebounds. ``I'm so excited for everyone who
worked so hard for this. This was our goal after we came back from
Hawaii, and it started with Colorado. We said this is a new season
and we're going to win this conference.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The No. 22 Longhorns crowned themselves in an arena that,
instead of echoing with the hollow losses of the last two seasons,
resounded with cries of ``Big 12 Champs!'' by orange-clad fans who
dominated a Ferrell Center crowd. Texas won for the eighth time in
nine Big 12 road games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Senior Kris Clack led with 21 points as Texas was up as much as
21 and led by no fewer than 10 from 8:44 of the first half to the
end of the game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked hard all year, and we're deserving of this,'' Clack
said. ``It was just a matter of putting it all together as a team
and expressing on the court all the hard work we did in practice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of orange up in the crowd, and that was
wonderful. We didn't end the game like we wanted to, but we came
out with a 10-point win, and that's fine with us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Baylor (6-22, 0-15) closed with a 10-2 spurt, which upset Texas
coach Rick Barnes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, I'm very happy for the players and the fact we are
where we are today,'' Barnes said. ``To win a regular-season
championship in these days of expanded conferences where you're
playing 16 games shows that you've got to be mentally tough and
have a lot of disipline over a two-month period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But we didn't have very good practice yesterday ... and got a
little too happy there at the end tonight, got a little careless
wanting to make home-run plays and score too quick. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to understand there's more out there, more basketball
to be played. We have another conference game that to me is as
important as any game we play.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Texas' most recent outright regular-season championship was in
the Southwest Conference in 1994; the Longhorns shared the SWC
title with Texas Tech in '95. &QL;

LAST-MINUTE CHANGE LEADS TO DEATH BY INJECTION FOR GERMAN
NATIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Ariz. _ Giving a thumbs up and mouthing ``I love you''
to his minister, convicted murdered Karl LaGrand was executed by
Wednesday night after a wild hour in state government of figuring
out to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   The case of LaGrand, a German national, attracted widespread
attention in Europe, and his attorneys had selected death by gas as
a grounds for reversal on appeal and to illustrate the horrors of
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the tactic worked.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted a stay early
Wednesday but the execution was reinstated when the U.S. Supreme
Court refused to take up the case.
</P>
<P>
   Then, about an hour before the scheduled execution, LaGrand
changed his mind about being gassed and selected lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   That set off a mad scramble in the offices of Gov. Jane Hull and
Attorney General Janet Napolitano as LaGrand's attorneys continued
to file appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano said she and Hull decided to grant his request
because of the lateness of the hour and ``rather than create
another avenue of appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Strapped to a gurney, LaGrand apologized profusely to the family
of Kenneth Hartsock, a Marana bank manager he repeatedly stabbed in
a bungled 1982 robbery attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry this took so long and dragged out,'' said LaGrand,
35. ``But from the bottom of my heart I'm sorry for what I did. I
hope one day you can find it in your heart to forgive me.''
</P>
<P>
   LaGrand also looked in the direction of Dawn Lopez, a former
teller at the bank who is now a policewoman. She survived an attack
by LaGrand's brother, Walter, who is scheduled to be executed next
Wednesday for the same crime.
</P>
<P>
   Karl LaGrand apologized to her also.
</P>
<P>
   She looked down and closed her eyes as the poison began to flow
through his veins.
</P>
<P>
   Four minutes later, he was dead.
</P>
<P>
   The case was front page news in Germany, which has no death pen
alty.
</P>
<P>
   The LaGrands' mother married an American serviceman and moved to
the United States when they were boys. German officials, including
that country's ambassador to the United States, testified on Karl
LaGrand's behalf at a clemency hearing Tuesday and remained adamant
Wednesday that his life should have been spared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe they're doing this. It churned my stomach,''
said Steffen Ufer, an attorney from Munich, Germany, who was
assisting the LaGrand brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. would probably threaten us with an atomic bomb if we
did this to one of your citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Ufer also said he would not participate in any more of what
referred to as ``alibi hearings.'' Walter LaGrand is scheduled to
have a clemency hearing Tuesday, a day before his execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm through with this,'' Ufer said. ``Now it is time to go
mobilize Germany's politicians on behalf of Walter.''
</P>
<P>
   The LaGrands were sentenced to death for the January 1982 murder
of Hartsock, a Marana bank manager who was stabbed 23 times and had
his throat cut during a bungled robbery attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The LaGrand brothers also critically wounded Lopez. Lopez
recounted the horror of the attack Tuesday at Karl LaGrand's
clemency board hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, now a Pima County Sheriff's deputy, recalled that she and
Hartsock were bound with electrical tape and recounted the frenzy
of the attack after Hartsock kicked Karl LaGrand in the shins.
</P>
<P>
   The LaGrands were born into poverty in a Bavarian town at the
height of the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Both LaGrand brothers and their sister have different U.S.
soldiers for fathers and each abandoned them.
</P>
<P>
   The LaGrands were later adopted by yet another GI and brought to
Arizona in 1967 when the GI was transferred to Fort Huachuca in
Sierra Vista.
</P>
<P>
   But their adopted father left the family after becoming
dependent on alcohol and drugs in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were left to fend for themselves, bouncing among
juvenile homes and families who would shelter them for short

STARS LOSE GAME, LOSE HULL FOR AT LEAST TWO WEEKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
DALLAS _ The injury bug caught up with the Stars last night, just
as the Nashville Predators did. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Predators threw the Stars a changeup in a 2-1 Nashville
victory, and the injury bug claimed Brett Hull and Joe Nieuwendyk.
Hull is expected to be out ``a minimum of two weeks,'' Stars coach
Ken Hitchcock said, after Hull pulled a hamstring muscle when he
caught the edge of his skate in a rut on the ice. Nieuwendyk is
listed as day-to-day after missing last night's game with a
sprained ankle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Combine those injuries with a knee injury to Darryl Sydor
(expected out two weeks) and the Stars are hitting a wall in the
82-game season. The loss was sealed when Sergei Krivokrasov scored
with 28.6 seconds remaining. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned that's a loss where the schedule just
caught up to us,'' Hitchcock said of the Stars' playing on
back-to-back nights in two cities, as well as playing their sixth
game in 10 nights. ``We need to rest and regroup.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They also need some contributions from their role players. Hull
scored his 26th goal of the season last night and his 12th in the
past 15 games. However, the Stars will have to learn to live
without his scoring presence for a while. Nieuwendyk tested his
ankle in the pregame skate then was scratched from the game. He
could play tomorrow against the Pittsburgh Penguins. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to learn from this game and pick it up,'' said
winger Mike Keane, who likely will play on the first or second
line. ``When we lose players like that, we all have to step in.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Stars last night showed the aftereffects of expending a ton
of energy the night before to claim a 4-3 come-from-behind victory
in Nashville, Tenn. A night after getting a season-high 45 shots
against the Predators, the Stars were held to 18. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They also struggled to adapt to Nashville's change of pace _ a
game plan heavy on trapping and team defense _ as well as bad ice
conditions at Reunion Arena. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible,'' Stars defenseman Shawn Chambers said.
``When you have \RMike Modano\S and \RSergei Zubov\S fumbling the
puck, you know there's a problem.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Stars saw a seven-game unbeaten (6-0-1) streak snapped and
fell to 36-11-9, still 11 points better than Phoenix for first
place in the Western Conference. The Predators, meanwhile, extended
their road success, pushing themselves to 5-1-1 in their past seven
road games, good for a 21-32-6 record. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Stars suffered their first loss to the expansion team in
stunning fashion when Predators winger Krivokrasov stole the puck
from Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher in the final minute of
regulation and rushed up ice. Krivokrasov stopped at the right side
of the crease, faked an onrushing Hatcher off his skates and tried
to look to pass. With no opening available, Krivokrasov instead
pushed a backhand past Stars goalie Roman Turek for the game-winner
with 28.6 seconds remaining. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turek (10-2-2) suffered his first loss since Jan. 10, stopping a
four-game winning streak for him. He registered 23 saves and had
given the Stars the chance to hang on for a tie. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping for the tie,'' Hitchcock said. ``A point would
have been good tonight.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Predators coach Barry Trotz didn't see it that way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a game we deserved to win,'' Trotz said. ``Taking
nothing away from Dallas, but we stuck to our game plan.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Stars scored first with Hull wristing in a loose puck at the
10:51 mark of the second period, but the Predators tied the game
six minutes later when Andrew Brunette was allowed to get to a
loose rebound on the power play. Both teams then played chess until
the end. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Stars will have to make a few moves, altering their
lineup and also trying to get refreshed while playing five games in
the next eight nights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to buckle down and look at winning games 1-0 and
2-1,'' Hitchcock said. &QL;

 TEN YEARS LATER, JIMMY JOHNSON DEFENDS
JERRY JONES (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By RANDYc.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
It was 10 years ago this morning when Jimmy Johnson, having sampled
the hostile mood of the local populace, decided immediately upon
his most sensible course of action.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I got the hell outta Dodge,'' Johnson said yesterday,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   On a Saturday afternoon _ Feb. 25, 1989 _ Johnson hitched a ride
to D-FW and grabbed the next flight for home, which was, then as
now, Miami. He would return in a few days and stay a few years.
</P>
<P>
   But later that evening at Valley Ranch, in what is still
considered by many as the darkest moment in North Texas sports
history, a fellow from Arkansas took the podium, introduced
himself, and life with the Dallas Cowboys would never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Today is the 10th anniversary of the infamous ``Saturday Night
Massacre.'' Or, to be fair, today is the 10th anniversary of the
Jerry Jones era, which has produced the most Super Bowl success in
franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, admit it, Jerry hasn't been that bad. Granted, Jones'
first impression on that Saturday night long ago did cause massive
gagging. For some, the gagging continues to this day. And for four
of his 10 years at Valley Ranch, Jones allowed a pair of empty
shoes to serve as head coach, simply because of ego. Plus, Jerry
also seems to top everybody's least-likely-to-be-trusted list.
</P>
<P>
   But. . .
</P>
<P>
   Three Lombardi Trophies in a four-year span is unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry is good. Jerry is bad. And there hasn't been much
grey-matter in-between.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, of course, would be at the top of any
least-likely-to-defend-Jones list. There is, however, an exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one criticism that sticks with Jerry 10 years later, and
it's the thing many people in Texas will never forgive him for,''
he said, ``is also the criticism he never deserved. Not then or
now.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, would be how Jones ``handled'' the firing of
Tom Landry in the ``Saturday Night Massacre.'' And count me among
the chorus that has repeatedly said it wasn't done the proper way.
</P>
<P>
   An excited Jones, overcome with joy about buying the Cowboys
from Bum Bright, ran smack into media hostility that night a decade
ago. Most of it centered on the Landry issue. Such hostility was a
reflection of outrage throughout the area.
</P>
<P>
   A novice at dealing with the media, Jones was easy prey on that
evening. He basically came across as a greaser from the Arkansas
outback, as opposed to an astute businessman who had just wrangled
a $140 million loan to buy the most popular football franchise in
the land.
</P>
<P>
   But in a Dallas newspaper that Saturday morning, there was a
front page picture of Jones and Johnson enjoying Tex-Mex at Mia's
on Lemmon Ave. Actually, they were dining on enchiladas, and not
Landry's carcass. But the ``buzzard'' impression stuck. Landry had
been told nothing, but here was the rumored new owner of the
Cowboys feeding freely in Dallas with his rumored new head coach.
</P>
<P>
   And for irony, Landry's favorite Tex-Mex restaurant, then and
now, is Mia's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, man, it looked bad,'' said Johnson of the front page
photo. ``We were staying at a hotel and Jerry came by the room and
said he wanted to take me to a little out-of-the-way place. I told
him I didn't think it was a good idea. It was Friday night. Every
place would be packed. But he was positive no one would recognize
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry just forgot he was suddenly a long way from little ol'
Little Rock. But on that same Saturday morning, the sale of the
team was finalized. Only one obstacle remained _ how to deal with
the Landry issue.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson: ``Tex \RSchramm\S was there with us at Bum's office,
and he's a savvy guy, so he advised Jerry to send me back to Miami
and not have the coaching part of the press conference until the
next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody, however, had to tell Landry, and Bright immediately
volunteered to personally fire the only coach the Cowboys ever had,
removing the heat from Jones and taking it himself. Other
suggestions then followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard Tex on the phone with Tom, all but telling him a
coaching change was coming,'' said Johnson. ``These were men I had
great respect for; coach Landry and Tex Schramm were idols of mine
growing up in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't going to be easy. I felt bad. But Jerry stood
right up to it. He would not let Bum do the firing. He would not
let Tex inform Tom with a phone call. He would not phone Tom
himself. Jerry said the deal couldn't get done until he told Tom
face to face. And Tom had gone to Austin to play golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry then put everything on hold, got on a plane, flew to
Austin, and found Tom on the golf course. Contrary to popular
opinion, Jerry was not a close friend of mine and I hadn't been
around him much. But after seeing that, I walked out that afternoon
really impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Public perception, however, was just the opposite. And remains
so. ``But on this part,'' said Johnson, with a laugh, ``I strongly
defend Jerry.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, and miracles do happen.

BIG MAC BACK WITH POWER ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. Sullivan 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
JUPITER, Fla. _ The winter after hitting 70 home runs, Mark McGwire
met Pope John Paul II, spoke with John Glenn, did a voice over for
[ix]The Simpsons[nm] and kissed Helen Hunt. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he showed up at the St. Louis Cardinals' training camp for
the first full-squad workout yesterday, he convincingly
demonstrated his off-season hobnobbing with the rich and famous
hardly diminished his slugging prowess. McGwire smacked 13
baseballs over the left-field fence during batting practice despite
hitting into a stiff wind. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every ball crushed was accompanied by the rapid clicking of
dozens of cameras and the oohs and ahhs of several hundred fans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My body has been itching to go the last three weeks,'' McGwire
said. ``As soon as the Super Bowl is over, I feel it's baseball
season. I started hitting around Jan. 10 as I always do. I'm not
going to change anything just because of what I did last year.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals general manager Walt Jocketty confirmed that at
McGwire's first news conference by announcing, ``We're here to
dispel any rumors Big Mac is leaving baseball to pursue a career in
acting.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God,'' McGwire said, fresh off his cameo appearance on
[ix]Mad About You.[nm] &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead, McGwire is back in uniform for an encore performance
after becoming a national sensation last year with his assault on
baseball's single-season home-run record. He went into spring
training last year with people anticipating he might assault the
record. Turns out he shattered it, hitting nine more than Roger
Maris hit in 1961 and four more than Sammy Sosa did for the Chicago
Cubs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There was more pressure keeping the home-run \Rlead\S than in
breaking the record,'' said McGwire, who hit his historic 62nd home
run on Sept. 8 off of Cubs pitcher Steve Trachsel. ``Sammy Sosa had
a darn good year. He was right there with me. Breaking the record
that night, I knew there was a lot of time left. To hold and keep
the record, that was tough.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McGwire did so with a spectacular final weekend, hitting five
home runs in three days against Montreal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McGwire enters this season with the simple goal of hitting 50
home runs, something he has done the past three years. The
possibility of reaching greater heights than 70 home runs seems
remote. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything is possible, but I think it would be foolish to sit
here and think you can break your own record from last year,''
McGwire said. ``What I did last year, ballplayers have been trying
to do for the last 38 years. To hit 70 home runs, you would have to
have 40 at the All-Star break. I can only imagine the pressure. I
know how hard it was hitting 61 or 62; imagine trying to hit 10
more. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in awe of what I did last year. I'm still in awe.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said, ``expectations are always tough but the only
expectations I have to live up to are the ones I set for myself. I
know what I can do. Last year was a magical year. It may never
happen again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Then again, it may.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said he had a relatively uneventful off-season, even
with the guest appearance on Mad About You and the opportunity to
meet the Pope. He took two trips to Mexico and one to Australia.
The Australians didn't recognize him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd take one look at me and look away,'' McGwire said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He didn't receive the same treatment in the United States or
Mexico. McGwire is trying to become accustomed to being mobbed as a
hero wherever he goes. He said there was not one time he was able
to go to dinner in the off-season without being recognized. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had so many people join me for dinner, it's amazing,''
McGwire said. ``If I walk into a place and just one person
recognizes me, it was all over. People will just walk up and sit
down and tell me their stories, where they were last year, what it
meant to them, how they were never going to watch baseball and now
they're watching it again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty neat. People have been great. I don't think I
had a problem this whole winter with anybody. I deal with it every
day.'' &QL;

   Class isn't conferred on you with your first million or your

after your first NBA championship or your fifth. The kind of class
that was cut loose from the Forum Wednesday cannot be bought or
won.
</P>
<P>
   You either have it or you don't.
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows Del Harris could have mustered enough ammunition
to go out with guns blazing after being relieved of his
head-coaching duties 12 games into his fifth season with the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, goodness is as goodness does, which explains why
Harris sat in the Forum on Wednesday and removed the dagger from
his heart and did his best to wipe off the fingerprints of owner
Jerry Buss and Jerry West. He even forgave his players for their
cowardice in preventing the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Though clearly in shock, Harris lent dignity to the funeral
proceedings as foreign to Buss as a girlfriend his own age; as
alien to this 1999 Lakers team as strength of character and as
unfamiliar to the newest Laker, Dennis Rodman, as a nuclear family.
</P>
<P>
   Harris refused to stoop to the level of the bullying Buss _
never mind that Buss fussed more over Kobe Bryant becoming a
starter and Rodman becoming a Laker than he did over Harris, who
was effectively operating without a net with no contract beyond
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I owned the team, I might make the same decision, in all
honesty,'' said Harris, who didn't get mad, he got humble. He gave
thanks for ``the opportunity to coach the Los Angeles Lakers. It's
as high as you can get in what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all so civil it made you want to cry.
</P>
<P>
   If Harris harbored any hurt feelings _ and honestly, how could
he not? _ he kept them well-hidden underneath a cloak of decency.
</P>
<P>
   At times his speech sounded like a publicist's pitch. Harris
called it an honor to have had the chance to work with ``the Big
Man'' and Kobe Bryant and Robert Horry and Eddie Jones, too.
</P>
<P>
   Harris always did defend his players. His downfall was that he
never really got any public show of support from them in return.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven knows he could have borrowed a page from the behavioral
manual of O'Neal and ranted and raved about the injustices. Owners
are just like officials, Harris could have wailed, near-sighted and
unfit.
</P>
<P>
   He could have gotten in players' faces as former Laker Nick Van
Exel was getting into his up until he was traded to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Harris could have announced that he was ``The Man,'' as Bryant
did. Or gone into a funk at the first hint that he wasn't long for
the Lakers, as Jones did. Or prayed openly for team unity, as Derek
Fisher did.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Harris tried to be tough without being disrespectful.
He acted more like a teacher than a recess monitor. He went for
steady over ostentatious. In the end all it got him was a pink
slip.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought his firing was fair, Harris gave an answer
for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of fairness,'' he said. ``I think we make
a mistake in life assuming everything is going to be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   A level playing field, he went on to suggest, doesn't provide
nearly as fertile ground for growth as one seemingly tilted against
you. ``You learn and grow through struggles in life,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   The pity was this message left a deeper impression on at least
one reporter in the room than it did any of Harris' players. The
truth is, the Lakers, losers of their last three and 6-6 in this
shortened season, look about as equipped to tackle life's
inequities as they do to defend Western Conference champion Utah's
pick-and-roll.
</P>
<P>
   Don't take our word for it. Listen to the Worm, who followed
Harris to the podium and in an interview session in which he was
more subdued than sassy, said of his new teammates, ``You can't
bitch and complain when you're making 12 and 15 million dollars a
year and not producing. If you're going to win a championship,
you've got to go in and look at films, look at players, study the
game of basketball, visualize. A lot of guys today don't feel the
game of basketball. They just come in and try to be flashy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have enough flash to light up a sky. What they were
lacking was a power forward with an attitude. They got one in
Rodman. And if the players were yearning to be free of Harris'
half-court game and his long-winded homilies, that wish too has
been granted.
</P>
<P>
   The ball is in the players' court. If they continue to
underachieve, they'll have no one to blame but themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were our players,'' said a solemn West, ``I'd take a very
good look in the mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who showed up toward the end of the optional practice,
said the players had a meeting and did just that. Whether or not
they were just primping and preening remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't make Del look good,'' O'Neal said. ``It's an
unfortunate situation.''
</P>
<P>
   And one that probably couldn't be avoided. ``To be candid with
you,'' West said, ``I think it was inevitable that it was going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course. In Southern California about the only thing that
doesn't change is the weather. Cheekbones and chests rise and fall.
Actors and singers come and go. If attention-deficit disorder is a
disease, L.A. wants no part of the cure.
</P>
<P>
   Angelenos want what they want and they expect it yesterday. In
the end, Harris' Midwestern sensibilities simply got in the way.

MCGWIRE CONCERNED ABOUT LABOR FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
JUPITER, Fla. _ St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Mark McGwire said
he is ``scared to death'' about what might happen the next time
owners and the Players Association negotiate a new Basic
Agreement. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   McGwire's feelings are based on what happened during the
off-season with the record-breaking contracts handed out to some
free agents. The current agreement expires after the 2001 season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we can get something done before then,'' McGwire said
yesterday. ``I sure hope what happened in 1994 _ salaries are
getting up there _ doesn't happen again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be so disgusted, I'd walk away from the game. I don't know
how we baseball players and owners could let that happen again
after what we did last year.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Baseball enjoyed a sensational season in 1998, mainly because of
McGwire's 70 home runs and the 66 hit by Chicago Cubs outfielder
Sammy Sosa. The feeling in the industry was that the Great Home Run
Chase helped to heal the wounds left over from the 1994-95 players
strike and the cancellation of the World Series. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But new fears about what might happen during the next
negotiations were renewed this off-season with the further widening
of the gap between big-market and small-market clubs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most notable was the Los Angeles Dodgers giving pitcher Kevin
Brown a seven-year contract worth $105 million and California
Angels first baseman Mo Vaughn setting a standard for position
players with a six-year, $80 million deal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's do it now. Let's sit down and be reasonable, and let's
keep the game on top,'' McGwire said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Labor relations was one controversial issue McGwire addressed
yesterday during a news conference. The other was Androstendione,
his controversial dietary supplement. It is legal in Major League
Baseball but has been banned by the International Olympic Committee
and other organizations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said he will continue to use it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's legal,'' McGwire said. ``Major League Baseball is not the
IOC, and it has absolutely nothing to do with hitting a baseball.
It has something to do with getting me through workouts with my
body being worn down.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball is studying the possibility of banning
Androstendione. But McGwire said if that happens, it would not
tarnish his record. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody has any common sense, they'd know it has nothing to
do with hitting a baseball,'' he said. &QL;

INCIDENT PUTS FOCUS ON SPRING-TRAINING SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Tuesday's altercation between Rangers
hitting instructor Rudy Jaramillo and a 23-year-old man might
result in the organization reducing spectators' access at its
Charlotte County Stadium complex. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We'll discuss it and see if we need to make any changes or
consider this an isolated incident and leave things as they are,''
Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said yesterday. ``I'd hate to
see a lot of fans hurt because of the incident Tuesday, but it is a
possibility.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said he plans to discuss the issue with Rangers president
Tom Schieffer, who is scheduled to attend the first full-squad
workout today with owner Tom Hicks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The incident points to the larger issue of safety and security
for players, coaches and fans at the more accessible spring
training facilities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, the Cardinals, knowing that interest in home-run
king Mark McGwire will be more intense than ever this spring,
stepped up security at their training complex in Jupiter, Fla. But
fans have easy access to his batting practice _ if they can see
over all the cameras _ and he spent 15 minutes signing autographs
behind a fence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a bodyguard,'' McGwire said, responding to a
story that he would be followed by an off-duty police officer.
``The security here is for the St. Louis Cardinals. We had to bump
up security because of the number in attendance here at Jupiter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked to hear I was coming to camp with three
bodyguards. I don't need a bodyguard. I don't want a bodyguard. I
just want to be myself.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jaramillo tussled with Dave Davison, 23, Tuesday after Davison
failed to return baseballs hit beyond the left-field fence at a
practice field. A sign near where their scuffle occurred requests
that spectators return all baseballs to the playing field. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jaramillo and Davison exchanged shoves, and the latter's shirt
was torn.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy admits he was wrong,'' Melvin said. ``He never should
have let that happen.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jaramillo acknowledged regret for the incident and declined to
comment further. Melvin spoke yesterday with Davison on the
telephone and offered an apology. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The event, though, demonstrated to Rangers officials that one
spectator can instigate an incident that can escalate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers employ two off-duty deputies from the Charlotte
County Sheriff's Department as security guards. The officers keep
unauthorized personnel out of the Rangers' clubhouse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, those who roam the complex to watch workouts have no
organized supervision. Melvin pointed to several people seated in
the shade of a practice-field dugout. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We allow fans in those dugouts to stay out of the sun,'' he
said. ``We don't say anything to them.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' complex is fan-friendly, and that might be an
understatement, said Jerry Hill of North Richland Hills. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the sixth year Hill and her husband have visited Florida
for spring training. They have been to Arizona, where 10 other
major-league teams have camp, twice. They have visited more than 20
spring-training sites, and Hill said the Rangers allow more
accessibility to players than anywhere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``These people park in the lot with the players,'' she said.
``You don't find that at any other ballpark.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That might change. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid it's going to be the fans who lose out because of
one person, one obnoxious person,'' Grant Hill said. ``I wasn't
here Tuesday and didn't see the incident, but it just takes one
person to ruin it for everyone else.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lack of security, though, does not appear to concern Rangers
players.this decade. ] &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to walk through a wave of fans every day here,''
pitcher Rick Helling said of the 400-yard hike from the clubhouse
to the field where the Rangers begin most workouts. ``There's
definitely a greater opportunity for something bad happening here.
I think it could happen, but I don't think any of us worry about
it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neither does manager Johnny Oates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That never enters my mind,'' he said. ``Maybe I'm naive.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oates' greater concern is for spectators' safety. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they have too much access out there?'' Oates said. ``Yes,
in my opinion, they do.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oates watched a boy almost get hit by a batted ball yesterday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He never knew that ball went by him,'' Oates said. ``It's too
late after it hits him.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oates said he also fears children or the elderly might be run
over by those chasing baseballs for souvenirs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want my children or father out there,'' he said.
``It's all fun until someone gets hurt badly.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consider Davison. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him \RTuesday\S,'' Melvin said. ``What a nut. He was
running around everywhere chasing down balls. He could play center
field for some teams.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Watching batting practice from beyond the outfield might soon be
a thing of the past for those who visit the Rangers' training
complex. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It has absolutely nothing to do with the baseballs,'' Oates
said. ``We go out there with 50 dozen baseballs and come back with
25 dozen. That's no big deal. We just go get another 25 dozen.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Safety of players and spectators is the issue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take a look at this,'' Melvin said. &QL;
</P>

   LOS ANGELES -- It was a big night for peacocks.
</P>
<P>
   The 41st annual Grammy Awards at the Shrine Auditorium provided
an opportunity for every fashion maven and victim in the music
industry to strut their wildest Technicolor clothes, and most
looked like extras on the old ``Sonny and Cher Show.'' The trends
were myriad, with lots of duster coats, dresses with safety pins
(Dixie Chicks did it best), patchwork, hair sparkles, big diamond
cuffs on guys, and an array of velvet retro designs that probably
came from a Silver Lake thrift store.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Oscars, performance groups are a big part of the
Grammys, so it takes some effort to coordinate a fashion-savvy
look. And the Temptations did their homework; their suits were
coordinated in patterned variations of black and white, accented by
one member wearing all yellow. The band THEM provided colorful
comic relief with complementary costumes trimmed in pink feathers.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Black's wife, Lisa, wore a blue plaid pantsuit by Moschino
with blue sandals that revealed her blue toenail polish, and
Shirley Manson of Garbage wore a blue dress that revealed she
wasn't wearing undies.
</P>
<P>
   But the real peacocks on the red carpet were the men. There were
country-western inspired long rider coats sporting brightly colored
satin linings by Manuel of Nashville (fans included the Dust
Brothers). Then there was the head-to-toe satin suit that was a
fave with younger music men. Ernest Chapman, who arrived with his
mom, Beth Nielsen Chapman, wore a red one, while Aaron Carter
(younger brother the Backstreet Boys' Nick), chose canary yellow.
His suit was accented with a huge clunky ID necklace with his name
in rhinestones. ``My brother got it for me,'' he said of the
jewelry that turned out to be the hottest men's accessory trend of
the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there were plenty of folks in leather, fur and feathers,
but a few nominees went for pure elegance. Among them were Celine
Dion in a beaded gown by Carolina Herrera; Shania Twain in a
dazzling white sequined gown by Marc Bouwer; Jennifer Lopez in a
Versace minidress; and Alanis Morissette, who looked like a
modern-day Juliet in her Elizabethan gown of brown chiffon.
</P>
<P>
   Brandy and Monica went for the class act, too, wearing
coordinating champagne satin ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   For the label-conscious, Sheryl Crow wore a black bustier and
shrug (a blend of stole and a sweater) with a slim skirt by Dolce &AMP;
Gabbana; Jennifer Love Hewitt wore a strapless black number by
Donna Karan; John Tesh's wife, Connie Sellecca, wore a purple
sari-inspired outfit by Barcie Waite; Regina Bell chose a Pamela
Dennis gown with huge diamonds by David Orgel; and Jada Pinkett
Smith wore a gold knit gown by Los Angeles designer Eduardo Lucero.
</P>
<P>
   Men who went for the suave-and-sophisticated look over
fun-and-funky were Lyle Lovett in Armani, Jerry Seinfeld in Prada
and Shawn Mullins in Hugo Boss.

DALLAS _ Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk missed last night's game with
a slight ankle sprain suffered the night before in Nashville,
Tenn. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk is listed as day-to-day. The 32-year-old center
missed five games at the beginning of the season and five games in
January because of residual pain from two knee operations in the
summer. Nieuwendyk is fifth on the Stars in scoring with 12 goals
and 20 assists for 32 points. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last night, the Stars also were without Darryl Sydor (knee
injury, out two weeks) and Brian Skrudland (chest contusion, two to
four weeks) and lost Brett Hull to a leg injury in the third
period. Hull is expected to be re-evaluated today. &QL;

The Stars played host to their 24th consecutive sellout crowd of
16,928, extending their franchise record. The Stars have sold out
25 of 28 home games this season. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NICE TRIP &QL; 
The Stars and Predators had to travel from Nashville after
Tuesday's game for the home-and-home series. Due to the short
distance (Nashville is the Stars' closest geographical rival) and a
7 p.m. start on Tuesday, the Stars arrived back at Dallas/Fort
Worth Airport by 12:45 a.m. yesterday. It is the earliest the Stars
have returned from a road trip since moving to Texas in 1993. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THREE STARS &QL; 
1. Sergei Krivokrasov, Predators _ Amazing move to score game
winner &QL; 
2. Cliff Ronning, Predators _ A constant thorn in the Stars' side &QL; 
3. Tomas Vokoun, Predators _ Came up with big saves when needed &QL; 
 &QL; 
X-FACTOR &QL; 
The Stars seemed more tired from the back-to-back situation than
the Predators, who played a great road game. &QL;

NELSON CRITICIZES SAMAKI WALKER'S PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
DALLAS _ Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson criticized the
play of Samaki Walker yesterday and disputed recent comments made
by his agent, Norm Nixon, who said the team is not treating the
power forward fairly. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nelson said the Mavericks don't play well when Walker is on the
floor, which is why Walker hasn't been on the floor much lately.
The third-year veteran has played a total of six minutes in the
past three games, and is battling John ``Hot Rod'' Williams for
12th-man status on the Mavericks' 12-man roster. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you guys would care enough to look it up _ which is pretty
easy to do _ the minutes that Samaki is on the floor, the team has
not done well,'' Nelson said. ``That's what a coach looks at; what
are the pluses and minuses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some big minuses when he's on the floor. We've
played him at different times with different lineups and the
results are often the same.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walker is averaging 5.9 points, 4.1 rebounds and 15 minutes, and
is shooting 39.4 percent from the field. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Nixon said Nelson is controlling Walker's minutes on
the court in an effort to control the amount of money his client
can earn on his next contract. Walker can be a free agent after
this season, and Nixon said the former Louisville standout stands
to lose a lot of money if he's not able to get on the court and
prove his worth. The Mavericks say they want to re-sign him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said backup power forward Gary Trent is the main reason
why Walker isn't getting more playing time. He also praised the
play of starting power forward A.C. Green. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you who's limiting \RWalker's\S playing time is
Trent, not me,'' Nelson said. ``If Samaki was playing as good as
Trent is, Samaki would be playing. It's really that simple. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A.C. has played pretty darn well, too.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trent averaged 18.5 points, 9.3 rebounds and 27 minutes during a
recent four-game stretch. In the Mavericks' past three games,
Walker did not play against the Los Angeles Clippers, played the
last six minutes in a loss to Phoenix, and did not play in
Tuesday's victory against Atlanta. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nelson pointed out that Trent, like Walker, will be a free agent
at the end of this season, and that he isn't limiting Trent's
minutes in order to squash his earning potential. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``So by playing the game that Mr. Nixon says I play, why
wouldn't I do it with Trent?,'' Nelson asked. ``I don't like being
accused of things like that. That's unfair. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes Samaki better than I do. I wish he was playing
better. But Trent is the man right now.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nixon has instructed Walker not to make any comments about his
contract or lack of playing time. But Nixon says he steadfastly
believes Nelson is not treating his client fairly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Samaki loves Dallas and wants to be there,'' Nixon said. ``But
he has to be ready to go play somewhere else.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walker and Nixon are seeking one of two proposals for a contract
extension with the Mavericks: $30 million over four years or $42
million over six years. The Mavericks offered a four-year, $20
million deal, but might let the March 13 deadline to sign Walker
pass. Walker then could test the free-agent market, beginning July
1.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite his remarks about Walker, Nelson said the 6-foot-9
third-year pro remains in the team's plans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of our talented young players,'' Nelson said. ``Do
you think we would have offered him what we offered him if he
wasn't in our plans for the future?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But when asked if the four-year, $20 million offer to Walker is
still on the table, Nelson said: ``I don't really know. I really
don't even want to know, because I'll get accused by Mr. Nixon of
something else.'' &QL; 
Trent's deal &QL; 
If he keeps playing the way he has played lately, Trent could be
one of the most sought-after free agents in the NBA this summer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks are limited in what they can offer the third-year
veteran, but Nelson said they will make every effort to re-sign
Trent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We like Gary Trent very much,'' Nelson said. ``And he's proven
to be everything I thought he was.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trent said he would consider re-signing with the Mavericks after
the season. &QL;

NASCAR ASSUMES TV RIGHTS FOR WINSTON CUP RACES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ NASCAR, the only sport with television-ratings
increases each year this decade, plans to consolidate broadcast
rights to cash in on the accelerating popularity of stock-car
racing. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASCAR announced yesterday it no longer will allow racetracks to
negotiate separate TV deals, returning to the setup it employed
until 1978. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the biggest news story of the year in
motorsports,'' said Eddie Gossage, executive vice president and
general manager of Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth. ``This could
well mark the true beginning of the success of modern-day Winston
Cup racing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tracks generate about $100 million in rights fees for 34 Cup
races from CBS, ABC, NBC, ESPN, TBS and The Nashville Network.
Gossage and his cohorts at Speedway Motorsports Inc., say they
believe current premium events on the schedule should see broadcast
rights fees double. In some instances, the value of rights could
increase five-fold. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said CBS is paying approximately $4.1 million for rights
to broadcast the Coca-Cola 300 NASCAR Busch Grand National race
March 27 and the Primestar 500 Cup race March 28. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TMS' four-year contract with CBS expires after the 2000 race,
and Gossage said he is unsure how the impending deal would affect
rates at the Fort Worth facility.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on fees in general, Gossage said, ``I think we're
looking at $400 million or better in the year 2001.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR officials intend to continue the current TV rights fee
distribution formula of 65/25/10 as it pertains to tracks,
competitors and the sanctioning body, respectively. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wins in this deal,'' Gossage said. ``Twenty-five
percent goes into the purses for competitors, and if it increases
to $400 million, that's $100 million that goes into purses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The \Radded\S revenues also will help us to keep our costs
down. We're probably close to tapping out our fans' revenue right
now. Ticket prices are plenty high. Now, we're making headway.'' &QL;

WOMEN WIN BIG AT GRAMMY AWARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- As expected, the 41st Grammy Awards turned into
another ladies night out, continuing a decade-long trend, as
hip-hop chanteuse Lauryn Hill won five awards, Madonna took home
three (tripling her career total) and Sheryl Crow's ``Globe
Sessions'' was named best rock album in ceremonies held Wednesday
at the Shrine Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually discovered women a long time ago,'' said Steven
Tyler, lead singer of Aerosmith (winners of best rock group
performance).
</P>
<P>
   The Grammys did, too, as performers like Shawn Colvin, Alanis
Morissette and Sheryl Crow have dominated the ceremonies of recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   This year was no different, with Hill winning album of the year
and best new artist, the Dixie Chicks (``Wide Open Spaces'')
snagging best country album and Morissette winning two awards for
female rock performance and best rock song (``Uninvited'').
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so amazing . . . this is crazy because it's hip-hop
music,'' Hill said while picking up her fifth award for her solo
debut, ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.'' The Fugees member broke
Carole King's 1971 record for most Grammys for a female artist in
one year.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old Hill, who led with 10 nominations in nine
categories, also won best rhythm and blues album. Her hit song,
``Doo Wop (That Thing)'' won best R&AMP;B song and best R&AMP;B vocal
performance, and she was named best new artist despite having been
part of the Grammy-winning Fugees.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna's biggest prize came early in the evening when her
techno-tinged ``Ray of Light'' was named best pop album.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a surprise. I'm honored,'' said Madonna, whose
famed blond hair has been replaced by straight black tresses.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the dominance of women, Natalie Maines of the
Dixie Chicks said, ``Right now, the women are doing the original
stuff, setting themselves apart in terms of style and music. The
guys . . . well, they just all look the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Crow (who wore a minuscule abs-ahoy top while performing ``There
Goes the Neighborhood'') more or less agreed backstage, saying she
wanted Hill to produce her next album.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just so incredible,'' Crow enthused. ``She deserves
every award and every accolade that has come her way this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Celine Dion and her ubiquitous ``My Heart Will Go On'' wasn't
left out, either. The song won four Grammys, including song of the
year and record of the year and Dion's female pop vocal.
</P>
<P>
   Said Dion: ``Every night when I start my concert, people
immediately want to hear that song. And I'm like, Hold on! I'll get
to it! I've got a few new songs first. But people go so crazy when
the music for `My Heart Will Go On' starts that it makes me forget
that I've sung it so many times. It becomes a thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anyone else who could have sung it,'' said the
song's composer, James Horner, who admitted backstage that he had
stopped listening to the ``Titanic'' theme more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just took on a life of its own,'' Horner added. ``I never
guessed it would have been this big of a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Shania Twain (and her thigh-high boots and short-short dress)
was a hit with voters and audiences alike. Twain won for country
song (``You're Still the One'') and female country performance. Her
performance during the show of ``Man! I Feel Like a Woman!'' was
anything but country, however. More like Def Leppard Lite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time I've ever worn a short skirt,'' said
Twain, who usually favors outfits that expose her famous
bellybutton. ``Dressing up is the fun part. I like looking good and
I enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   And the men in attendance did, too. The Grammys didn't
completely ignore the male sector, with country singer-guitarist
Vince Gill winning three awards and Will Smith taking home best rap
solo performance for the popular, mainstream hit ``Gettin' Jiggy
Wit It.'' (He dedicated the award to his son, Trey.)
</P>
<P>
   Smith bested Hill, Busta Rhymes, Wyclef Jean and hard-core
rapper Jay-Z, who boycotted the ceremony because he didn't feel the
Grammys gave rap music the proper amount of air time. Ironically,
Jay-Z won best rap album (``Vol. 2 . . . Hard Knock Life''),
awarded in the portion of the Grammys not televised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay-Z is cool,'' said fellow rapper Missy ``Misdemeanor''
Elliott backstage. ``And I think that someday the Grammys are going
to start giving rap its due.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if a woman (Missy?) puts out a great record, they will. By
the way, Elliott's new album (affectionately titled ``She's a
Bitch'') hits stores in May.

TAME GRAMMY CEREMONY REWARDS WOMEN OF ROCK, POP, RAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: Fred Shuster is the Los Angeles Daily News' music
critic.) 
BY FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Most hard-core music fans given the choice would
probably rather spend three hours cleaning shrimp than watching the
yearly orgy of self congratulations, back-patting and missed cues
that is the Grammy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's always a veneer of excitement about the glittery
event. Wednesday's 41st annual show at the Shrine Auditorium was no
exception. For sheer star power, Madonna opened the telecast in
Kabuki mode, suggesting a step away from the Indian Buddhist look
and London cabby accent of the American Music Awards earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the number of nominees with two X
chromosomes this year, but that's been the trend for the past
several years. Year of the woman? The '90s have been the decade of
the woman.
</P>
<P>
   The record academy recognized aspects of what was a pretty good
period for pop music overall, even while it may not have been a
stellar year for many of those who toil within the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Best rock album winner Sheryl Crow mentioned from the Grammy
podium that her label, A&AMP;M, went under recently as a result of the
largest shake-up in music history. She dedicated her trophy to
those employees who lost their jobs in the Seagram's acquisition of
PolyGram.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to win a Grammy tonight because it is a closing of an
era. . . . I am sort of a poster child for my label and small
labels like A&AMP;M,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the academy advertised the ceremony as ``the awards
show where anything can happen and usually does,'' there was no
``Soy Bomb'' moment like last year when an uninvited guest dropped
in on Bob Dylan's performance. And apparently no cuss words had to
be bleeped out of the telecast.
</P>
<P>
   The only hint of controversy -- and it was so minor hardly
anyone noticed -- was the absence of hard-edged rapper Jay-Z, who
won the pre-telecast rap album category but boycotted the event to
protest what he considered the lack of prominence given to the rap
genre and specifically for not nominating his fellow New York City
rapper DMX for best new artist.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a bit short-sighted in a year when hip-hop diva Lauryn
Hill led the field with 10 nominations for her solo disc, ``The
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' which won album of the year.
</P>

recent Time magazine cover gal who cut the largely reggaefied
grooves of her debut album at Bob Marley's Tuff Gong studio in

most critics and academy voters could agree on this year.

   Another critically acclaimed disc, Lucinda Williams'

solicits 496 critics nationwide. The poll is one of the most
respected in the industry.

Bastard, the New York rapper who rushed the podium last year during
Shawn Colvin's acceptance speech, to liven things up. But there was
heavy security at the Shrine, and you got the feeling that even if
the Ol' Dirty one had a bona fide ticket in his possession, he'd be
hustled off to a holding cell immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the people's choice was heard loud and clear
Wednesday. Celine Dion's ``My Heart Will Go On'' sopped up four of
the miniature golden gramophones. A contender for the most
irritating song of the year, the ``Titanic'' theme had the extra
oomph of an Oscar win -- a fact, combined with 26 million records
sold, that was irresistible to academy voters.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it was a granny kind of Grammys. But there's always
next year to look forward to -- by then Ol' Dirty Bastard should be
out of house detention, and kiddie pop star Britney Spears will
have developed a political agenda.

TAME GRAMMY CEREMONY REWARDS WOMEN OF ROCK, POP, RAP
</HEADLINE>

critic.)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Most hard-core music fans given the choice would
probably rather spend three hours cleaning shrimp than watching the
yearly orgy of self congratulations, back-patting and missed cues
that is the Grammy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's always a veneer of excitement about the glittery
event. Wednesday's 41st annual show at the Shrine Auditorium was no
exception. For sheer star power, Madonna opened the telecast in
Kabuki mode, suggesting a step away from the Indian Buddhist look
and London cabby accent of the American Music Awards earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the number of nominees with two X
chromosomes this year, but that's been the trend for the past
several years. Year of the woman? The '90s have been the decade of
the woman.
</P>
<P>
   The record academy recognized aspects of what was a pretty good
period for pop music overall, even while it may not have been a
stellar year for many of those who toil within the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Best rock album winner Sheryl Crow mentioned from the Grammy
podium that her label, A&AMP;M, went under recently as a result of the
largest shake-up in music history. She dedicated her trophy to
those employees who lost their jobs in the Seagram's acquisition of
PolyGram.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to win a Grammy tonight because it is a closing of an
era. . . . I am sort of a poster child for my label and small
labels like A&AMP;M,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the academy advertised the ceremony as ``the awards
show where anything can happen and usually does,'' there was no
``Soy Bomb'' moment like last year when an uninvited guest dropped
in on Bob Dylan's performance. And apparently no cuss words had to
be bleeped out of the telecast.
</P>
<P>
   The only hint of controversy -- and it was so minor hardly
anyone noticed -- was the absence of hard-edged rapper Jay-Z, who
won the pre-telecast rap album category but boycotted the event to
protest what he considered the lack of prominence given to the rap
genre and specifically for not nominating his fellow New York City
rapper DMX for best new artist.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a bit short-sighted in a year when hip-hop diva Lauryn
Hill led the field with 10 nominations for her solo disc, ``The
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' which won album of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, one-third of the enormously successful rap group the
Fugees, won five Grammys to add to the pair of trophies she took
home several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There will be few calls for Hill's impeachment. A single mom and
recent Time magazine cover gal who cut the largely reggaefied
grooves of her debut album at Bob Marley's Tuff Gong studio in
Jamaica, Hill's smart pop-rap was one of the few musical events

ASSAULT UP AT LOS ANGELES SCHOOL CAMPUSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- While crime rates fell at most California public
schools last year, incidents of battery and assaults with deadly
weapons on Los Angeles Unified School District campuses rose,
according to a state report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles school officials said they were puzzled by the jump
in battery cases but said that perhaps increasingly crowded
conditions at the district's schools are provoking friction among
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you enhance the density of the population, there
could be a greater likelihood of violence,'' said Assistant
Superintendent Dan Isaacs.
</P>
<P>
   Officials noted, however, that Los Angeles' battery rate remains
substantially lower than the statewide average: 1.08 attacks for
every 1,000 students compared with an average of three per 1,000
students in California.
</P>
<P>
   And the report, released by the state Department of Education,
also shows the LAUSD is making progress against vandalism and
property destruction, officials said. The property crime rate in
Los Angeles schools fell from 8.41 per 1,000 students during the
1995-1996 school year to 6.77 last school year.
</P>
<P>
   School board member Julie Korenstein, whose district is entirely
in the suburban San Fernando Valley northwest of downtown, said the
drop in vandalism may be due to tighter security measures,
including metal grills across windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Security systems are better, fencing's better,'' Korenstein
said. ``It reduces the crime of people being able to get in and rip
off our computers.''
</P>
<P>
   The third annual California Safe Schools Assessment report
showed most types of crime dropping at schools throughout the
state, although there were exceptions. Elementary school districts
saw increases in battery complaints. And while fewer guns were
confiscated from students, authorities found more students with
knives.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics were reported by individual districts and contain
some large discrepancies between communities. Schools in Burbank, a
suburban community north of downtown Los Angeles, for example,
logged a battery rate six times higher than Los Angeles schools in
the report, a finding Burbank officials said had to be a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Scott, a state education department consultant who worked
on the report, said it was impossible to determine a margin of
error for the entire report. But an examination of the drug and
alcohol information, she said, found that about 32 percent of
districts under-reported their problems. Los Angeles was not among
those districts, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The report gives the LAUSD decidedly mixed grades. The number of
drug and alcohol offenses inched down, from 2.27 per 1,000 students
in the 1995-96 school year to 2.16 last year. The sexual assault
rate crept up, from 0.14 to 0.15.
</P>
<P>
   Robbery and extortion rates dropped by 15 percent, to 0.55 cases
per 1,000 students. The incidence of assault with a deadly weapon
rose and amounted to one attack for every 2,500 kids compared to
one for every 2,857 students the year before.
</P>
<P>
   School board member David Tokofsky said the district's safety
committee will discuss at one point next week whether to give
additional money to the district's police department, which has
aging cars and bulletproof vests no longer under warrantee. The
fact that such a large, urban school district as Los Angeles has
lower crime rates than much of the state, he said, is due in part
to its 300-member police force.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of districts don't even have a security department, and
I think that's a little naive,'' he said.

A DISSIDENT PRIEST IS EXCOMMUNICATED 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Roman Catholic priest in Rochester, N.Y., who was suspended
for expanding the roles of women, homosexuals and non-Catholics has
``excommunicated himself'' by starting his own church, the Diocese
of Rochester said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The priest, the Rev. James Callan, formerly of the Corpus
Christi Roman Catholic Church, has been renting out a Protestant
church and holding Sunday services there since Feb. 14. The
hundreds of parishioners who attend Callan's services inside Salem
United Church of Christ _ he said his flock numbered about 1,100 _
have been excommunicated, too, the diocese said.
</P>
<P>
   People who are excommunicated cannot celebrate Mass or give or
receive communion. According to Roman Catholic doctrine,
excommunication takes place automatically when a Catholic creates a
schism by attempting to take on independent authority in the
church. But the Rev. Kevin McKenna, the chancellor of the diocese,
said that Callan and his followers would be welcomed back into the
faith if they renounced the upstart church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church would consider this to be a medicinal remedy, in
the hopes that Father Callan and the other individuals would return
to the church,'' McKenna said.
</P>
<P>
   Callan said he had no such plans. ``I was kind of hoping they
wouldn't do this because it looks bad for them,'' he said on
Wednesday night, ``but as far as I'm concerned, this doesn't affect
me, and I don't think it affects most of the other people either.''
</P>
<P>
   Callan built Corpus Christi's flock up from about 200 when he
started there in the mid-70s to more than 3,000 last year, but his
increasingly liberal practices put him in conflict with the church
at a time when the pope is urging Catholics to adhere to tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Callan invited all people who considered themselves followers of
Jesus to take holy communion, a privilege the church generally
reserves for Catholics. He opened the church's marriage preparation
program to gay couples and has blessed five same-sex unions. And he
allowed a woman in the parish, Mary Ramerman, to preach, offer
blessings and stand behind the altar and raise the chalice during
consecration.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, the diocese transferred Callan to a small church
in Elmira, N.Y., about 70 miles from Rochester. In October, Ms.
Ramerman, the associate pastor at Corpus Christi, was dismissed.
And in December, Callan was suspended with pay for refusing to
follow church rules.
</P>
<P>
   Also in December, Corpus Christi dismissed six staff members
whom Callan had signed to one-year employment contracts in
September, shortly before his transfer. On Wednesday, four of the
workers sued the church and the diocese, charging breach of
contract and seeking 10 months' pay. McKenna said that the
dismissal was Corpus Christi's decision, and the new pastor at
Corpus Christi, Daniel McMullen, was not available on Wednesday
night, church personnel said.
</P>
<P>
   The diocese, which covers 12 counties in western New York, said
in a statement on Wednesday that it would consider dismissing
Callan from the priesthood, a more serious penalty that can only be
reversed by the Vatican, if he did not toe the line. It added that
the bishop, Matthew H. Clark, was reluctant to take such a step.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a happy situation,'' McKenna said.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Callan disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited,'' he said. ``It helps us a little bit because
we've been not celebrating Masses all this time. We've been holding
communion services with preconsecrated hosts, just to hold out an
olive branch to the diocese. But now that we've been
excommunicated, we can go back to celebrating the Eucharist and
operating the way we're used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Callan confidently predicted that ``within 10 or 20 years,'' the
church establishment would embrace his views and said he was
willing to work outside the system until then.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not starting our own denomination,'' he said. ``We
consider ourselves a Catholic church _ we're parallel. You know how
they say pork is the other white meat? Well, we're the other
Catholic church.''

FOR INTERIM, IT LOOKS LIKE RAMBIS

<P>
   &LR; INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Phil Jackson has six NBA championship rings
to his credit and a lot of time on his hands, but Del Harris'
successor as Lakers coach will come from within the Forum, at least
for now.
</P>
<P>
   With the firing of Harris on Wednesday, the Lakers will probably
hand the reins to assistant coach Kurt Rambis, although a decision
has not yet been announced. Lakers management planned to interview
both Rambis and assistant coach Larry Drew on Wednesday, and will
hire one of them as interim head coach as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have historically made our coaching choices from people
within our own organization, and we feel confident that one of
those two will be the person that will get us to where we want to
get,'' Lakers executive vice president Jerry West said.
</P>
<P>
   Until that decision is made, 18-year assistant coach Bill Bertka
is in charge and will lead the Lakers into tonight's game against
the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Either Rambis or Drew will then get the chance to make a mark as
head coach and try to earn the job permanently. West won't look for
a permanent replacement until the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   And Jackson? The former Chicago Bulls coach is probably the best
available candidate, but he's taking the year off, and West
declined to comment on him.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old Rambis is viewed as a logical successor to
Harris, particularly because of his strong ties to the franchise's
glory years, as a player in the 1980s. He was a hot commodity last
summer, interviewed for head coaching positions by both the
Sacramento Kings and the Clippers, but Rambis ultimately decided to
stay with the Lakers, perhaps because the team knew Harris' tenure
was coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two assistant coaches, Rambis is the more laid-back, and
Drew, also 40, is the more aggressive. Rambis has been an assistant
for most of the last five years (interrupted by a few returns as a
player) and currently coaches the Lakers' centers and forwards.
Drew, a former point guard for the Kansas City Kings and later the
Lakers, is in his seventh season as an assistant and coaches the
guards.
</P>
<P>
   Players said they would be happy with either coach, and Harris
said both have promising futures as head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only hope is they do give it to one of my assistant coaches
to finish it out,'' Harris said, ``and what a tough choice that
would be. I think they're both terrific. . . . I just find both of
them to be just great prospects for being coaches. And I hope that
in the next two or three years, each of them is a head coach
somewhere in this league.''

ROBINSON OFFICIALLY QUIETS DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ After a chat with the NHL's czar of off-ice
discipline, Kings coach Larry Robinson has agreed to keep his
``Holy Macaronis'' to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Following Saturday's 2-2 tie in Calgary, Robinson erupted while
discussing the performance that night of referee Stephen Walkom.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the worst officiated game I've ever seen,'' Robinson
said that night in a tone of high-decibel exasperation. ``I'm
disgusted. I'm sorry. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a break. You're not supposed to criticize (officials)?
Holy Macaroni. I'll get a young kid out of the stands who can do
just as good a job. It's awful. I've never seen anything like it in
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   According to NHL spokesman Frank Brown, Robinson's phone
conversation Tuesday with league vice president Colin Campbell
closed the matter, with Robinson agreeing not to disparage
officials again in such vivid terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, what really happened was that public comments
made in Calgary were intended to be in jest,'' Robinson said
Wednesday. ``But I probably shouldn't have made them. I was upset
at the time. I was told not to make such comments publicly. The
issue is at rest. There's nothing more to be said.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Admiring words: Luc Robitaille, the hockey player, is having
a difficult time getting wins.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille, the horse, is another matter. The 6-year-old pacer
has won 10 of his last 12 races and placed in the top three in 68
of his last 73 outings.
</P>
<P>
   Bred in Bakersfield, the horse was purchased three years ago by
Kevin Wallis of Windsor, Ontario, which is minutes from Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Told about his equine namesake's success, the Kings' left wing
said, ``He's faster than me.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Blast from the past: Petr Klima has returned to the NHL with
the Red Wings after spending most of the past two seasons playing
in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old winger began his career with the Wings in
1985-86, then bounced around the league for more than a decade,
scoring 312 goals along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of stint No. 1 in the league was an eight-game
stint at the start of the 1996-97 season with the Kings, for whom
he produced all of four assists and was a defensive liability.
</P>
<P>
   After attending the Red Wings' training camp, he began this
season in Germany, staying only long enough to collect a bonus he'd
been promised if he remained there through Jan. 1. He returned to
North America last month, playing 13 games for the Wings'
Adirondack farm team in the AHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I signed a contract (with the Wings), there were no
guarantees,'' Klima told the Detroit News. ``I went down (to
Adirondack) to play and wait to see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Klima did not play against the Kings and has one goal in four
NHL games this season. &QL;

UPSTAGED RODMAN EXPECTS TO DEBUT FRIDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Picture this: After three weeks of grabbing
headlines just by !ital!thinking about joining the Lakers, Dennis
Rodman finally arrives at the Forum as a full-fledged member of the
purple and gold and he's not even the top news story of the day.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a lot to upstage Rodman, but the firing of coach Del
Harris did just that on an unusual Wednesday afternoon at the
Forum. The Lakers had originally scheduled a press briefing with
Rodman on the occasion of his first workout with the team after
signing a contract late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was only once the media arrived that a Lakers spokesman noted
the team had ``made a coaching change.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rodman did take the podium after Harris, expressed sympathy
for the ousted coach and declared himself ready to play for the
newly reshuffled Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman signed a one-year deal for the veterans minimum salary _
$1 million, prorated to $463,414 for the remaining games _ and has
an option for a second year.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-time rebounding champion and noted cross-dresser said
he is in game shape but expected to make his playing debut Friday
night, when the Clippers come to the Forum. And he vowed to be the
same steady force here as he was while winning five NBA titles in
Chicago and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's gonna be a lot of pressure on Dennis Rodman to produce
and bring some type of unity to this (team). But I get paid just
like everyone else on this team to go out there and work hard and
hopefully get us to the Finals,'' he said. ``I've been producing
for 12 years, and hopefully these guys see that and not be too
immature not to know that it's not all about fun and games, it's
all about winning basketball games here. It doesn't matter what
pressure I'm under, I always come through in the clutch.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman and team leader Shaquille O'Neal have verbally sparred in
the past, Rodman deriding O'Neal's game and O'Neal dismissing
Rodman as ``a bum.'' But O'Neal lobbied hard to bring the
``thuggish rebounder'' to the Lakers, and Rodman said they have put
all the harsh words behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no hard feelings,'' Rodman said. ``I've always
respected Shaq. We had a little choice words here and there about
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, who hid black-and-white hair under a large hat, said
Lakers management had made no demands of him with regard to his
appearance, his off-court behavior or other extracurricular
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in the city of extracurricular,'' he said. ``This is
perfect for me, brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman went through a brief workout with Robert Horry and the
Lakers' three rookies while the rest of the team took a needed day
off.
</P>
<P>
   Horry said he'll happily play behind Rodman at power forward but
cautioned that Rodman's arrival guarantees nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis is not the answer. . . . Dennis is just a piece of the
puzzle we need,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Horry's return: Horry practiced for the first time since an
irregular heartbeat surfaced 12 days ago and said he felt fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is clear for me. I'm ready to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors attributed the condition to a viral infection, but
Horry's heartbeat has returned to normal and the problem is not
expected to resurface. &QL;

IN A YEAR OF THE WOMEN, LAURYN HILL LEADS AT THE GRAMMYS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lauryn Hill won five Grammys, a record for a
female artist, with the first hip-hop recording to be named album
of the year, ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' at the 41st
Annual Grammy Awards ceremony at the Shrine Auditorium here.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hill, in accepting the award for best album, which mixes
rhythm-and-blues, gospel, pop and rap, exclaimed, ``This is crazy
because this is hip-hop music.'' Among her other Grammys was the
one for best new artist.
</P>
<P>
   The two other top awards on Wednesday night went to ``My Heart
Will Go On,'' sung by Celine Dion, which won record of the year
(presented to a song's performer) and song of the year (presented
to songwriters, in this case James Horner and Will Jennings). The
song, from the unsinkable ``Titanic'' soundtrack, also won an award
for best pop vocal performance.
</P>
<P>
   The other big winners at Wednesday night's ceremony, which was
broadcast on CBS with Rosie O'Donnell as host, were also female,
including Alanis Morissette, Sheryl Crow, Shania Twain, Madonna and
the Dixie Chicks.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter in the Grammys press room asked Ms. Dion what
she thought of all the female winners, she was rankled. ``I don't
like that question,'' she said, and then added: ``It's wonderful
that there are a lot of women coming forward in politics and show
business. Good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Grammy voters are well-known for their erratic,
unpredictable and often outlandish choices, few were surprised when
the Grammy favorite Ms. Dion and the favored newcomer Ms. Hill
walked away with armloads of prizes. In her acceptance speech for
best new artist, Ms. Hill brought a Bible onstage and read Psalm
40. With so many awards, she could have held an entire service on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hill's five Grammys surpassed by one the number won by
Carole King for her ``Tapestry'' album in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hill, a member of the rap group the Fugees who released her
first solo album to rave reviews and millions of sales last year,
even beat herself in two categories. For best rhythm-and-blues song
and the best female rhythm-and-blues vocal performance, her own
song telling women to respect themselves, ``Doo Wop (That Thing),''
won Grammys at the expense of Aretha Franklin's ``A Rose Is a
Rose,'' which was written by Ms. Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited about Lauryn Hill the day I heard that record,''
said Michael Greene, the president of the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences, which presents the Grammys, in an
interview before the show. ``I sweated bullets because I wondered
if the academy membership would get it. But they got it. They got
it big time.'' Ms. Hill received 10 Grammy nominations, more than
any other artist this year.
</P>
<P>
   Many have called this year's Grammy celebration the year of the
woman, but the awards show could also be called Madonna's revenge.
Despite a decade and a half of recording, she had only previously
received one award, for best long-form video in 1991. Now, in her
latest guise as a raven-haired spiritualist, Madonna, who opened
the show with a Japanese-flavored performance of ``Nothing Really
Matters,'' has three more Grammys to her name: best pop album, best
short-form video and best dance recording.
</P>
<P>
   The country trio the Dixie Chicks pulled an upset by winning the
best country album award over Shania Twain. In their acceptance
speech, the Dixie Chicks feigned surprise that a country act that
actually played its own instruments and sang what it wanted won an
award.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Twain responded with wounded pride backstage when asked
about losing to the Dixie Chicks. ``You never know what to expect
with these things,'' she said. ``I'm the biggest seller.'' She also
won two more awards.
</P>
<P>
   Though the rock group Garbage didn't win any awards, its singer
Shirley Manson _ heeding Ms. Hill's advice in ``Doo Wop'' by
petulantly refusing to let Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins
put his arm around her while they were presenting an award _
deserves points for capturing a free advertisement by wearing a
dress with the artwork from her record on it. In another rarity for
the night, the Grammys presented a Latin pop contender unfamiliar
to mainstream pop fans, the former Menudo singer Ricky Martin, who
took advantage of his big break with one of the biggest production
numbers of the night for the song ``La Copa de la Vida.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapper Jay-Z learned on Wednesday night that snubbing the
Grammys doesn't lose a musician any points. The gangsta rapper had
announced that he was boycotting the Grammys for overlooking
rappers and asked that his name be withdrawn from the running. He
was specifically upset with Grammy voters for not nominating his
fellow rapper DMX for best new artist and at the music industry in
general for paying more attention to violence in rap than to his
upcoming tour. Nonetheless, his ``Vol. II . . . Hard Knock Life,''
won the award for best rap album. True to his word, Jay-Z was not
here to accept the award.
</P>
<P>
   In a year of major changes for the music business, particularly
the sale of Polygram to Seagram and the industry's resistance to
the distribution of music via the Internet, Sheryl Crow was the
only award winner to acknowledge the upheaval. During her speech
for best rock album (for ``The Globe Sessions'') she delivered a
eulogy for her record label, A&AMP;M, which was shut own by Seagram,
and the executives who lost their jobs there.
</P>
<P>
   Past winners of top awards won again this year. There was Ms.
Dion, who won the album of the year award in 1996. Eric Clapton,
the big winner in 1993, won best male pop vocal performance for
``My Father's Eyes'' and Alanis Morissette, who swept up in 1996,
won best rock song and best female rock vocal performance for
``Uninvited.''
</P>
<P>
   One Grammy favorite, though, Tony Bennett, lost this year: to
Elmo of Sesame Street for best children's musical album.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, previously neglected artists received long
overdue Grammys. In her acceptance speech for best traditional pop
vocal performance for her ``Live at Carnegie Hall'' album, Patti
Page said that when her grandchildren asked what name to call her:
``I said Grammy because I'll never get one. Now they have to call
me granny.'' And Shirley Horn, after six previous nominations, won
her first Grammy for best jazz vocal performance for ``I Remember
Miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Grammy critics who've complained after watching Elvis Costello
get snubbed year after year were temporarily quelled. Costello won
a Grammy by collaborating with a four-time winner, Burt Bacharach,
on an album, a song from which (``I Still Have That Other Girl'')
won best pop vocal collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Over half a century since its heyday, swing is officially pop
music again. The Brian Setzer Orchestra, led by the former member
of the rockabilly revivalists the Stray Cats, won best pop
instrumental performance for ``Sleepwalk'' and best pop vocal
performance by a duo or group for ``Jump Jive an' Wail.''
</P>
<P>
   In the classical field, the conductor Pierre Boulez won, adding
to his 20 awards, for best opera recording (``Bluebeard's
Castle''), and best orchestral performance (``Mahler: Symphony No.
9'').
</P>
<P>
   Recordings released between Oct. 1, 1997, and Sept. 30, 1998,
were eligible for an award. The winners were selected by the 10,000
voting members _ from musicians to producers to industry executives
to liner note writers _ of the recording academy.

ANGLERS PROUDLY DISPLAY TAGS

<P>
   INDEPENDENCE, Calif. _ Like tiny badges of honor, the metal
clips stamped with ``CAL-DFG'' are displayed proudly on stained
fishing vests and the worn lapels of lucky flannel shirts. But
their significance is largely a mystery to anglers, even to the
most experienced fishing guides.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery only deepens after the source is vividly determined
when a huge rainbow trout is landed bearing such a tag pinned to
its gill plate. But what does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   ``The word isn't getting out to the angling public exactly what
our program is about,'' said Mike Seefeldt, assistant manager of
the Eastern Sierra's Mount Whitney and Black Rock state fish
hatcheries.
</P>
<P>
   The tags identify rainbows that are reared in the DFG's
3-year-old trophy trout program, and anglers who catch a tagged
trout have every reason to beam. Released at weights of 1 to 5
pounds after at least 10 months' growth in larger pens than most
hatchery fish swim in, the tagged trout represent less than 2
percent of the total production of any given hatchery. Most trout
average a half-pound when they are stocked in angling waters,
Seefeldt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are definitely thrilled when they get a tagged fish
because they are so much larger than most of our catchables,'' said
Greg Kollenborn, a fish culturist at Hot Creek State Fish Hatchery,
east of Mammoth Lakes, where the staff fields weekly calls from
anglers curious about the tags. ``I've seen people with tags on
their hats. They want to show them off. It's cool, like saying, `I
caught the big one.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At the Mount Whitney and Black Rock hatcheries, for example,
just 6,700 of an estimated 334,000 fish annually earmarked for
planting are set aside and raised as trophy trout, which are larger
because they have more room to grow. When ready for release, the
trophy trout are rounded up in their pens, individually placed into
plastic-foam cradles and tagged, then planted the next week in
various waters. The process is repeated throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   While the hatcheries produce rainbow, brown and golden trout,
the trophy program is limited to rainbows. Similar programs in the
Eastern Sierra are found at Hot Creek and Fish Springs state
hatcheries. A small percentage of large brood stock, the majority
of which are planted after two years in the hatchery, are also
tagged as a supplement to the trophy trout program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tags are like trophies for the anglers. It's nice to hear
from people who catch them,'' said Seefeldt, who recently posted on
his office wall a newspaper clipping of a woman holding a 5-pound,
23-inch tagged rainbow. ``Sometimes people bring them here, but
mostly we see them at campgrounds or along streams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling for everybody, including the hatchery
crew, which works very, very hard to put out a very good-looking
fish and a healthy fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Tired of private entrepreneurs, such as Tim Alpers and his
renowned Alpers trout, getting the lion's share of credit for
planting trophy trout, the DFG initiated its program so that
anglers could easily identify rainbows raised with revenues derived
from the purchase of state fishing licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anglers know by the tag this fish was paid for by them,''
Seefeldt said. ``And it's also our way of saying thank you to the
angler for their support.''
</P>
<P>
   Since there is no state financing for studies on the tagged
trout that are caught, the hatcheries don't want the tags back.
Instead, they want anglers to keep the tags as souvenirs. Those who
practice catch and release can photograph the tagged fish for a
keepsake, as the metal clip shows prominently on the trout's gill
plate. &QL;

EASTERN SIERRA HEADS UP
</P>
<P>
   While the Eastern Sierra opens to angling for the most part
April 24 this year, an early trout-fishing season opener is slated
for March 6 along the western edge of Inyo County.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing grounds include all waters bounded by the Inyo County
line to the west and south, Independence Creek (which runs through
the town of Independence) to the north and Highway 395 on the east.
The daily bag limit is five trout; a total of 10 fish can be in
possession. The season runs through Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   For additional information, contact the Department of Fish and
Game in Bishop at (760) 872-1171.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a couple of Eastern Sierra angling tournaments will
take place next month:
</P>
<P>
   __ Anglers will gather at Diaz Lake, 1{ miles south of Lone
Pine, from sunrise to 3 p.m. March 6 to compete for prizes. Diaz is
open year-round. Information: (760) 876-4444.
</P>
<P>
   __ The annual Blake Jones Fishing Derby at Pleasant Valley
Reservoir northwest of Bishop, slated from sunrise to 4 p.m. March
13, will also feature a plethora of prizes. The derby is named for
the late Owens Valley resident and prominent Eastern Sierra-fishing
promoter. Information: (760) 873-8405.

<P>
   BISHOP, Calif. - In winter you can almost wade across the Lower
Owens River. Doesn't that make a drift boat to shuttle anglers down
it overkill?
</P>
<P>
   My doubts were largely reconfirmed after Mammoth Lakes fishing
guide Tom Loe scraped the hull of his aluminum McKenzie-style drift
boat along the gravelly bottom last Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A cold snap had sent the resident rainbows and browns into a
state of lethargy. Casting the heavy sink-tip fly line was a chore
in the face of a stiff wind.
</P>
<P>
   The only action was a beaver that disappeared with the slap of a
tail as we rounded one of the river's many oxbows that can make a
compass schizophrenic. Sure, there was also a hat that blew into
the water and a rare foul in lines in which two anglers' hooks
became enjoined, but to say things were slow is an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   My suspicions began to wane an hour into the seven-hour odyssey
when the first brown, about a foot long, was caught. As the
afternoon water temperature rose enough for the fish to take a more
serious look at our offerings, I warmed to the adventure. A few
minutes after 2 p.m. I boated a 19{-inch, 4\-pound rainbow, my
largest ever fly-fooled trout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you a believer now?'' asked Loe, who in November quit his
commercial pursuits of harpooning swordfish and hook-and-line
rockfishing to open Sierra Drifters Guide Service to guide
full-time.
</P>
<P>
   I was sold.
</P>
<P>
   The colorful size No. 8 spruce-adaptation streamer pattern had
done it's job; meant to mimic a baitfish, the fly proved
irresistible when the line was pulled underwater with short,
irregular strips through the guides on the 9-foot, 5-weight
graphite rod.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever size trout you catch on streamers _ which imitate
sculpin, squawfish, carp and other small prey _ they hit it real
hard, so you think you have Moby Dick on the line,'' said Gary
Gunsolley, a Bishop tackle-shop proprietor who cast a No. 10 olive
Hornberg fly while sharing the boat's bow with me.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliant crimson that defined the fish during the fight had
faded to a mere blush by the time she was returned to her chilly
home. A metal clip on the gill plate designated it as a trophy
trout. (See related story.)
</P>
<P>
   I might not have had a chance to release the fish, let alone
land it, had I been wade-fishing, Gunsolley explained; one surge
from the trout's tail could have pushed it around a bend in the
river, snapping the line. But with the boat's favorable
positioning, the fish was kept closer to the middle of the channel,
tiring sooner from the force of the current.
</P>
<P>
   Wading was not a likely option on this section of the Lower
Owens anyway. The banks are lined with an impossible tangle of
willow, wild rose and tule. Access is further impeded by a lack of
nearby roads.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown tired of failing to navigate the dense brush on
previous excursions, Dana Point stockbroker Bill Sidenfaden
surprised his girlfriend, Kelly Lee, with a Valentine's weekend
trip with Loe's outfit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't hear a person, didn't see a person. The fresh air and
the scenery is spectacular, with the snow-capped Sierra mountains
and the ospreys and all kinds of birds,'' Sidenfaden said of his
recent drift. ``You can see it's a classic fishery, with perfect
water and unpressured hole after unpressured hole.''
</P>
<P>
   While wading on earlier outings, he said, ``I would fish a
section for an hour and then want to move down river, and you can't
because of the brambles. You're stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple put three dozen trout in the boat; Sidenfaden lost
what was thought to be a 7- or 8-pounder in the weeds before any
real battle began. He plans to fish again with Loe in March and
April.
</P>
<P>
   Wind makes casting from the boat difficult, but that's only if
you manage to keep the line out of the bushes on the back cast. The
problem is solved by rollcasting, a relatively simple technique in
which the line is not cast above the angler but instead rolled out
while it lays atop the water.
</P>
<P>
   Loe offered other tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is to stay in contact with the line,
so you can feel the fly through the line and detect a strike,'' he
said. ``By having the rod tip actually in the water you are
minimizing the slack in the line and keeping the fly deeper and
closer to the fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Cast to either side of the foam, which flags the swiftest
current. It is here in the ``neutral zone,'' as Loe calls the slack
water, where the fish hover comfortably, close enough to the main
channel to dart in and grab a meal while expending the least amount
of energy. In winter, when their metabolisms are slow, these trout
need an excuse to move. By bringing the bait to them, dangling a
faux meal just above their maws, logic dictates it might entice a
bite.
</P>
<P>
   The day produced just 10 boated trout, but Gunsolley was happy
with a 16-inch rainbow and I'm still bragging about my prize.
</P>
<P>
   Loe is hoping to buck the odds and sway anglers to target
Eastern Sierra waters in the offseason. Most trout anglers take a
hiatus from traveling Highway 395 from November to late April, when
the bulk of the region is closed to angling. The Lower Owens River
is but one of a handful of fishing holes that are open year-round.
Loe has his work cut out for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a resource here that is 98 percent underutilized in
the winter,'' said Mike Seefeldt, assistant manager of the Mount
Whitney and Black Rock state fish hatcheries to the south.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager living in Bishop in the 1950s, Seefeldt and a
buddy floated and fished the Lower Owens in a pair of
torpedo-shaped airplane fuel tanks that were welded together. ``It
was a real Huck Finn experience,'' he said. ``I grew up in an
environment where what we took from nature supplemented the dinner
table, heavily. We took what we needed _ rainbows and a lot of
browns.''
</P>
<P>
   While the river can still be treacherous and Seefeldt urges
newcomers to be cautious, fishing has changed a lot since then. The
boats are better and catch and release is practiced. But Seefeldt
can't figure why someone didn't think of making a business
enterprise out of drift-fishing the Lower Owens earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised it didn't materialize years ago,'' he said. &QL;

OUT IN CAR COUNTRY, BANTER IS THEIR LANGUAGE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ For almost 22 years, Click and Clack, the
Tappet Brothers, have been doling out belly laughs and _ they
proudly proclaim _ bad car advice on public radio's ``Car Talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Their audience on 489 stations around the country is inching
dangerously close to three million listeners a week. The series
(which is heard in New York on WNYC-FM Saturday mornings at 10 and
WNYC-AM Saturdays at noon) is National Public Radio's most popular
non-news show, and nobody seems to know why.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask the stars, whose real names are Tom and Ray Magliozzi,
advises Ken Rogers, the associate producer. ``The boys are as
amazed as the rest of us that they've been tolerated this long,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A visit with the ``Car Talk'' crew offers some clues as to what
has solidified their hold on a generation of listeners whom they
have teased, tested and tutored. They offer a weekly hour of
general silliness sandwiched between car advice, automotive
puzzlers and relentless irreverence (directed toward the callers as
well as each other).
</P>
<P>
   WBUR Radio is on the Boston University campus, a block from the
Charles River, in a neighborhood that looks _ and is _
institutional. The studio is new and up to date, but the Magliozzi
brothers like to think of themselves as throwbacks to a more
leisurely time.
</P>
<P>
   On this Wednesday, a taping day, Ray, 49, the teddy bear of the
pair, has gone for a Sears, Roebuck look in his plaid shirt, chinos
and comfortable rubber-soled shoes. Tom, 61, a bit more of a
grizzly, is wearing chinos and a fashionably faded denim shirt.
They arrive with a shopping bag full of treats, which, since
they've sworn off fried pork rinds, includes bagels and cream
cheese with bacon grease.
</P>
<P>
   They joke with the crew until they're on the air. Then they joke
with the callers and each other. What you hear is what they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're out to have a good time and if, by accident we happen to
help someone, so be it,'' said Ray, who still runs the car repair
shop that the brothers started in 1973. The Magliozzi empire also
includes a syndicated newspaper column, three CDs and ``Car Talk''
the book.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about their success inspire answers about the show's
supposed business unit, formally named the Shameless Commerce
Division of the law firm Dewey Cheatham &AMP; Howe in Harvard Square.
And as listeners know, the guys never forget their extensive and
highly fictionalized staff in the closing credits.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: the customer care representative, Heywood Jabuzoff;
the chief negotiator, Bernadette Bridge; the director of
geriatrics, Al Takaka; the staff grammarian, I.M. Shirley Wright;
the oral historian, Studds Tercel, and the chairman of the Federal
Lubrication Board, Alan Greasepan.
</P>
<P>
   But reality does occasionally rear its rude head in the
brothers' lives. Once, lawyers for Chrysler visited the Magliozzis
after they had called the automaker's mini-van ``a piece of junk.''
``Like the IRS, they're a little thin-skinned,'' Tom said. ``A
bunch of babies, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, however, the hosts try not to take anything
too seriously. On the air, they laugh at their own often-repeated
jokes (like ``I bought my wife a Freudian slip'' and ``Keep your
chins up''). ``Our mother always tells us,'' Ray said, ```Don't
worry, no one's listening.'''
</P>
<P>
   Determined to lead lives in which fun comes first, the ``Car
Talk'' guys, who grew up in a gritty section of this erudite town,
have declined offers from television networks and Hollywood moguls
to embark on grander enterprises. They prefer to be immersed in
their own universe, in what Bostonians like to deride as the
Republic of Cambridge, a grandly quirky municipality where Nobel
laureates and out-of-work car mechanics rub shoulders daily.
</P>
<P>
   Ray still works at the garage almost every day. (He asked that
its name remain confidential lest he be inundated with work.) Tom,
meanwhile, manages the Web site (www.cartalk.com.) unless it's good
weather. Then he's out driving his 1963 Dodge Dart convertible.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sleek, it's black, and it's beautiful,'' said Tom, who
constantly admonishes listeners not to waste money buying new cars.
Ray, meanwhile, drives a modern, fuel-efficient 1987 Dodge Colt
Vista. ``It's a dirt brown _ so it never has to be washed _ marvel
of engineering,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to mention a study in ugliness,'' Tom added.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, they congregate with their own families, their
parents and their sister, Lucille, a music promoter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the black sheep,'' noted Tom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right,'' confirmed Ray. ``She's likable, well mannered and
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers' fascination with cars was born in the 1950s when
Tom did emergency repairs on his father's 1932 Chevy as Ray watched
in awe.
</P>
<P>
   Momentarily misguided, both attended the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. Tom graduated in 1958 as a chemical engineer and
actually worked for a local manufacturer for 15 years. Ray
describes himself as, ``MIT, class of '70, '71 and '72, majoring in
mechanical engineering, math and humanities.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduation (the last one), he relocated to Bennington,
Vt., to teach junior high school. ``It was charming, till I moved
there,'' he said. ``Then it was like a one-year prison sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Tom quit his job. ``I had to be there at 8 a.m. and
wear a tie _ every day!'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Ray got a call from his mother. ``She begged me to
come home to rescue Tommy or he'd slip into oblivion,'' he said.
``Also, I was promised barrels of money.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, four years after they opened the garage, a WBUR talk
show host invited Tom to join a few other mechanics for a show on
car repairs. For publicity's sake, Tom actually showed up. He was
the only one who did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a panel of expert,'' he reminisced.
</P>
<P>
   The host asked Tom to return. He did and brought his brother.
But, they recalled, ``the host had been fired but left a note:
`Good luck. Watch your language.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers went on and were soon offered a show of their own.
For five years, they actually focused on serious car issues; then
they got bored. ``There were enough shows that gave useful
answers,'' said Ray. ``We didn't want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   So the real fun started and they became entertainment icons with
banter like:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey Tommy, remember last week's puzzler?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a literary tale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespearean?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. Volkswagean.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Tom stopped working at the garage. ``I finally slipped
into oblivion,'' he said. And the show was picked up by NPR. The
``Car Talk'' guys, it seems, have become top earners for the
nonprofit public radio system, taking in as much as $60,000 an hour
during fund-raisers, said Murray Horwitz, NPR's cultural
programming director.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've become a great expression of American humor,'' Horwitz
said. ``And they really do know cars.''
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, the brothers say, the most reliable car is a Toyota;
the most obnoxious is a red BMW of any year. To find an honest
mechanic, they suggest, ``Get someone whose boat is paid for and
has no kids in college.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the most important thing to know about automotive
maintenance this year is, ``Prepare for Y2K,'' said Tom.
</P>
<P>
   Ray added: ``If you want to know how, send $1 to `Car Talk.' No
self-addressed stamped envelope needed.'' He almost sounded
serious.

OH, REMEMBER THE DAYS WHEN MUSIC COULD SING? 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Tony Scherman is the author of ``Backbeat: Earl Palmer's Story,''
to be published in april.  
 By TONY SCHERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was in my early teens, my father and I spent countless
Sunday afternoons driving around the Hudson Valley in his
Volkswagen Beetle. We often sang _ rather, he sang and I sometimes
joined in.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know many of the hundreds of Tin Pan Alley and Broadway
show tunes in his repertory; besides, their shapely melodies, full
of sharps, flats and key changes, were daunting.
</P>
<P>
   If I ventured to add my voice, my father quickly left the melody
in my quavery custodianship to improvise a flawless harmony.
Hitting an especially piquant interval, he would turn to me and say
something like, ``Flatted sixth,'' his feigned complacence masking
the pleasure he took in the sharpness of his ear.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't have known a flatted sixth if it had come crashing
through the VW's roof and knocked me on the head.
</P>
<P>
   My father was unusually musical, but that's not the point. He
grew up in an America whose pop tunes, the music he and his friends
imbibed as youths, were often highly sophisticated pieces of work.
(My mother is from a musical culture, too, but that's another
story; she's Viennese.) My father's generation, raised on Berlin,
Gershwin, Porter and Kern, developed a harmonic acuity, a
suppleness of ear, that mine lacks.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up on the three chords of rock-and-roll, on Phil Spector,
Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones (and the Beatles, of course, but
they were an anomaly, their chord progressions unpredictable, their
melodies hard to harmonize to).
</P>
<P>
   Music meant as much to my friends and me as it had to my father
and his contemporaries _ more, I think, for it was the emblem of
our resistance to the conventions we considered our parents trapped
in. Lyrically, our music was more interesting than all but a few
show tunes.
</P>
<P>
   That was Dylan's significance, after all: to give pop lyrics the
resonance of literature. But Dylan's harmonies are crude compared
with Gershwin's and Porter's. We and our musical heroes were, and
are, stuck in the blues, in simple triads and major keys that would
have bored Gershwin to tears.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying that everyone who grew up in the 30s can sing
perfect harmony and identify tricky intervals; I'm saying that
music fans today have a less intuitive grasp of two of music's
essential building blocks, harmony and melody, than they had 50
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I can't marshal much hard evidence for my argument. But given
the millions of hours of piano lessons my father's generation
collectively squirmed through, once as standard a feature of
middle-class family life as the upright in the parlor; given the
harmonically rich tunes that once floated daily from Times Square
office buildings out across the nation; given that America's
favorite dance hits once had enough intellectual meat to pique the
improvisational genius of a Charlie Parker or a Lester Young _
given these facts, these vanished aspects of everyday American
life, it's hard not to suspect that the average pop-music listener,
circa 1940, was more alive to the full range of musical expression
than his or her baby-boom offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five and graying, almost as old as my father was when we
took those drives, I eye my future uneasily. Am I going to spend
the rest of my life listening to rock-and-rollers chase threadbare
melodies across three chords?
</P>
<P>
   And what about the generation after mine, the Tone-Def
Generation, reared on music in which melody and harmony are even
more attenuated? It would be easy to argue that the last five
decades represent a wholesale dumbing-down of America's musical
public.
</P>
<P>
   Culture's path is never that simple. My father's hummed bass
lines may have been harmonically ingenious, but their
four-to-the-bar uniformity always irked me. In rock and its spawn,
rhythm has supplanted harmony and melody as the creative motor.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to be a hip-hop fan (although you do need a good
sense of rhythm) to hear the skill and creativity of more than a
few rappers, deejays and remix artists. Is it possible that the
young people who flock to today's dance clubs are developing an
awareness of rhythmic nuance equal to an earlier generation's
harmonic sophistication?
</P>
<P>
   Rhythm's new prominence reflects a seismic cultural shift. As
the world shrinks, Euro-America is awash in influences once beneath
its notice. The rhythm-rich sounds of Africa and the African
diaspora, whether Nigerian juju, Brazilian samba or
African-American funk, now pervade pop music. Today's musicians
draw on, and today's listeners absorb, rhythmic riches that were
unimaginable 40, or even 20, years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, how excited can you get about pop's expanding rhythmic
possibilities if our awareness of harmony and melody is atrophying?
Nor am I at all comfortable with some of the social implications of
rhythm's hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   When The New York Times critic Jon Pareles recently wrote that
in an era of overload, rhythm organizes time and information in
manageable, pleasurable ways, he touched on a troubling state of
affairs: the enervating sensory glut that makes serenity all but
impossible today. And Pareles's judgment that contemporary pop's
reduced melodies are the victims of shrinking attention spans _
well, it's a chilling thought.
</P>
<P>
   My father and I weren't just tooling around the suburbs, of
course; we were traversing the century, navigating its currents. He
died 20 months ago. As the months lengthen into years, I miss him
more and more. A small part of that ache, I think, is that his
death severed my living connection to an already faraway place: an
America whose pace was leisurely enough for its pop music to be
elegant.
</P>
<P>
   My father's ear thrived on the music of those centenarians
Gershwin and Ellington, whom my generation may admire but does not
love. Our souls belong to Elvis, and we pay the price.

PIERCE HAS LOOK OF PEERLESS ROOKIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Paul Pierce simply won't give us a chance to see if
there are any warts. After nine games, he's doing to the NBA what
Tiger Woods did to the PGA Tour: showing he's mature, developed,
prepared, well beyond his years.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any need to avoid the obvious any longer? Paul Pierce
is not only the best player on the Celtics, he's playing at a pace
that makes him a serious All-Star candidate. With every game he
plays, he looks so comfortable, so in place, that it's almost
sacrilegious to even call him a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   This guy may only have played three years at Kansas, but he came
out of the basketball womb ready to go, a full-term delivery. None
of this preemie stuff. He had all his fingers, toes, and every
other essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing against Paul since we were both in high
school,'' said Bruce Bowen, another Southern Californian. ``He was
always able to hold his own. Always. Wherever we played. He just
had a knack for it. With some young guys, the older guys think they
can find something. You can't find anything with Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce is polished. He belongs. Like Woods, he doesn't have one
of those days when he shoots a 79. He's a mortal lock for double
figures in points, but that only begins to tell the story. It's the
other stuff that he's doing with frightening regularity that, if it
continues, is going to thrust him right into Bird-dom in terms of
first-year contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night was yet another example, the ninth in nine
games. Pierce didn't even play in the elongated garbage time of
Boston's 111-79 bludgeoning of the Magic, but by then he already
had accumulated a more-than-acceptable dossier, starting with 19
points.
</P>
<P>
   He also had 6 rebounds, 3 assists, 5 steals, and 3 blocked shots
in 31 active minutes. He's undoubtedly going to be leading the
league _ again _ in steals when the latest stats spin off the Elias
computer Thursday. He's among the top 15 in the league in blocked
shots and scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Two defensive possessions in the third quarter cut to the
essence of the Pierce story. With Boston leading, 58-42, he missed
a shot. But he then stripped Anfernee Hardaway and that led to an
Antoine Walker dunk. (It also was the first hoop of a 9-0 Boston
run that ended competition for the night.) In that same stretch, he
also stripped the ball from Bo Outlaw and, while on his knees,
threw an over-the-shoulder, no-look pass to Walker, who fed Ron
Mercer for a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really take pride in my defense,'' Pierce said. ``You can
get embarrassed in this league and I don't want to be the guy on
the highlight film getting beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   How many guys talk about not wanting to be on ``SportsCenter''
for fear of humiliation?
</P>
<P>
   This is looking more and more like the Hoop God's rebate for the
1997 draft. It was as if last June, He looked down from above, and
told Rick Pitino, `OK, you missed out on Tim Duncan and Keith Van
Horn. But we'll have Paul Pierce ready, able, and vengeful for you
next year. Just hang in there.' '' (He might have added that Walter
McCarty is now officially Wally Pipp.)
</P>
<P>
   The Hoop God not only held Pierce for the Celtics, he also made
sure the Celtics were going to get someone who would look at the
nine teams that passed him by the same way Clint Eastwood looks at
creeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he got drafted 10th, he felt he had worked his entire
college career to be a high draft pick, and he wasn't,'' Pitino
said. ``So he decided he was going to get his body and his game in
great shape, to show people, to show himself. What he is is a man
with incredible pride.''
</P>
<P>
   We know now what happened the night of the draft. Pierce figured
he'd go in the top three. Should he unexpectedly slip a little, he
already had told Toronto and Sacramento to forget about it. Golden
State, which could have had him, decided to go with Antawn Jamison.
By the time it got to No. 8 and Philadelphia, Pitino was beginning
to think the unthinkable. But, he said to himself, how could Larry
Brown pass on a Kansas guy? (Answer: the same Larry Brown who
traded Van Horn for Tim Thomas, that's who.)
</P>
<P>
   Already, Pitino had seen his hoped-for guy, Dirk Nowitzki, slip
away, thanks to a trade. Now he was looking at UNLV's Keon Clark,
for goodness sake, but Pierce kept sliding. The Sixers took Larry
Hughes, who might be a fine player one day. Then came the
prearranged Nowitzki pick and it was Boston's turn. Pitino was
dumbfounded.
</P>
<P>
   We hearken back to Frank Layden's memorable line when Karl
Malone was still available at No. 13 in 1985. ``What does he have,
AIDS?'' Pitino wasn't thinking that, but he was thinking there had
to be a skeleton somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was sitting in that (draft) room, I said, `Dammit,
Philadelphia is going to take him,' '' Pitino said. ``And Chris
(Wallace) said, `No, they're not. They're going to take Hughes.'
And my next question was, `OK, what's wrong with him? There must be
something wrong with him. Find out what's wrong. There's gotta be
something.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There was something, of course. Something wonderful.

CAN'T READ THE CLASSIC? SEE THE TEEN MOVIE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By BRUCE NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It is the next logical development in Hollywood
high concept: the literary teen movie, bringing together young
people and their Cliff Notes in a way that ends the need for all
those dreary literary classics that clutter up the high school
experience. Think of the possibilities! ``Clueless II: Why Anybody
Would Read Jane Austen,'' ``Lolita: Summer Vacation!'' and ``I
Still Don't Know What James Joyce Was Talking About Last Summer.''
For the younger crowd there would be the inevitable ``Ernest
Hemingway Goes to Camp.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just such an impulse that gave Roger Kumble, a
32-year-old former video store clerk, the inspiration for ``Cruel
Intentions,'' which he wrote, and later directed, as ``Dangerous
Liaisons'' in high school. The new film navigates the shiny
surfaces of an Upper East Side world of Gothic brownstones and even
more Gothic behavior. And as with ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' it is a
place where sex is neither furtive nor fun: it is a weapon of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the source of Kumble's bright idea was the 1988
film adaptation of Christopher Hampton's play, written by Hampton
and directed by Stephen Frears. By the time Kumble came to
Choderlos de Laclos' 18th-century classic, ``Les Liaisons
Dangereuses,'' it was on the order of reading a studio
novelization. ``They're so mean and nasty in that movie,'' he says,
``I thought, `This is really what high school is like: hurting
people.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Phillippe, who stars as the film's Valmont, says: ``I
really hope this isn't Cliff Notes for kids. But I don't think
there's anything wrong with going back to a great piece of
literature and saying, `How can we apply this to our times?' That
was one of the challenges of this movie. Things that were socially
taboo in the 18th century aren't necessarily anymore. Kids are more
sexual now. They just are. So I think we exchanged taboo for
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The same transformation had been pulled off in ``Clueless,'' Amy
Hecker-ling's stylish 1995 updating of Jane Austen's ``Emma.''
Kumble allows _ a bit grudgingly _ that without the success of that
picture, his would not have been made. It came up again and again
during meetings with the studio. ``They'd go, `This is what Amy did
with `Clueless,' '' he recalls. ``And I thought, `Well, whatever
gets your movie made.' But I think mine's closer to the novel than
she got with `Emma.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Kumble did allow himself an occasional liberty with de
Laclos' novel. The careful reader will search in vain for where it
is written that the wicked Marquise de Merteuil, played in the film
by Sarah Michelle Gellar, informs the virginal Cecile (Selma Blair)
that she is going to demonstrate for her precisely _ very precisely
_ what it means to get to ``first base.'' And does. By this time,
Kumble has wheeled in for a close-up that is more clinical than
lascivious.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration is delivered with the erotic charge of a
particularly detailed set of Ikea instructions, and in Ms. Blair,
it is met with the sort of cloddish, adolescent enthusiasm that is
the opposite of sex. ``It was my first time kissing another girl,
and, you know, girls can be so judgmental,'' Ms. Blair said of the
scene. ``I care much more about what women think than men, so I
really wanted to impress her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gellar's sub-zero chill in that scene, and through most of
the film's nasty fun, concealed the actress's mounting alarm at her
own transformation from television's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' _
platinum-tressed defender against the undead and the dark root _ to
social vampire. Ms. Gellar is playing the sort of person whose
heart she might gladly drive a stake through on her show. And
though she had balled up her tiny fists and declared, ``I'm not
Buffy!'' during her first meeting with Kumble, there were certain
lines of dialogue at which Buffy got huffy. ``You're known for
being a certain way,'' Ms. Gellar says of her perky Buffy persona,
``and there were a couple of days at first when I felt like, I'm
just not sure I can say this.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Phillippe wasn't sure he would take on the role of
Valmont _ though not, as one might expect, because of John
Malkovich's daunting performance as a roue in the film a decade
ago. No, Phillippe offers, his reluctance was based on the fact
that, as he puts it, ``I have little sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   For months before filming began, the actors met at Kumble's
house to work out pesky problems brought on when the story was
modernized. In one scene, 14-year-old Cecile ``essentially gets
raped,'' says Ms. Blair, who plays her part with a kind of goony
charm. ``But somehow she puts a happy face on it, so it's not as
painful to watch.'' Kumble's goal, he says, ``was to take a
terribly uncomfortable scene and make people laugh. And then make
them feel bad that they're laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem was that there was nothing to laugh at in
Valmont, the character Malkovich had made indelibly and
heartbreakingly funny through the sum of his nasty parts. This new
Valmont suffered the curse of all modern leading men: He had to be
likable. ``I think when you do a period piece, it's easier for the
characters to be less likable,'' Kumble asserts, ``because there is
kind of a distance.'' Reese Witherspoon, who plays the demure role
once filled by Michelle Pfeiffer _ and who is romantically involved
with Phillippe in real life _ made her feelings about the character
known to Kumble early. ``It was nearly impossible to like him in
the first version,'' she says of Valmont.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Phillippe's conventional good looks, not to mention
the gorgeous '56 Jaguar roadster convertible in which he cruises
around Manhattan, should help insure his acceptance by high school
audiences. ``Some of the stuff that didn't end up in the movie was
a lot harsher, a lot more original, and there was less emphasis on
the romance,'' says Phillippe, sounding resigned. ``In studio
terms, romance is heroism, and I think the idea was that if love
and romance prevailed, you'd kind of forgive some of the seedier
aspects. But that's the way it always is. There's always this
dilution process.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Throughout the filming Kumble clung to two ideas: one, that
``Dangerous Liaisons'' in high school could work, and two, that
without so much as a music video to his credit he was the man to
direct it. Kumble, who grew up in Harrison, N.Y., attended public
high school there and abetted his video clerking with other humble
jobs like paperboy and bellhop. This, despite the fact that his
father, Steven Kumble, was managing partner of a prominent
Manhattan law firm.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Northwestern University in 1988, Kumble
was determined not to follow his father into the law, so he headed
off to California and immediately set about writing screenplays.
Five years later he wrote a mean-spirited play about Hollywood,
``Pay or Play,'' which chronicled his frustration with the studios
that would not make his movies. This, of course, led to several
screenwriting offers. ``Theater was more of a calculated move,''
Kumble says. ``I'd be lying if I said it was my great love for the
stage. It was more of a way of getting my work seen.''
</P>
<P>
   He followed that with a second play, ``d-girl,'' about low-level
studio development executives. It starred David Schwimmer of
``Friends,'' and became such a hit that the very Hollywood moguls
Kumble was skewering were fighting to get into the 99-seat theater.
``And in typical Hollywood fashion, they all wanted reserved
seats,'' he says. ``The whole point of both plays was to lure
people in and then midway through, attack them and make them feel
really bad. The great thing about theater is that you can be as
mean as you want, and it's like a roller-coaster ride that people
can't get off.''
</P>
<P>
   Determined to seize his moment, Kumble went to Mexico after
``d-girl'' closed, and two weeks later returned with the script for
``Cruel Intentions.'' He taught himself how to direct by renting
every laser disk he could find with a director's audio commentary
track and listening to them over and over again. ``The Criterion
School of Directing,'' he says, referring to the commentary-rich
Criterion Collection series. ``I wholeheartedly believe in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kumble says he is trolling amazon.com for his next literary
adaptation, and he may already have hit upon a way to add to this
expanding genre of de Laclos. ``The story exists on its own,'' he
says. ``You could do `Dangerous Liaisons' in space.'' Or not.(BOX)

   NEW YORK _ There is an expectant murmur in the room as the cast
and crew gather in Greenwich Village on the first morning of
rehearsals for ``Annie Get Your Gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Perched on the edges of their metal folding chairs are the
people who will spend the next 17 weeks bringing this classic 1946
Irving Berlin musical back to Broadway: Bernadette Peters, the star
who plays the title role of Annie Oakley; Graciela Daniele, the
show's director and co-choreographer; Tony Walton, the set
designer; William Ivey Long, the costume designer; as well as the
34 other members of the cast and many technical staffers.
</P>
<P>
   At the front of the expansive rehearsal studio, looking
typically coiffed and fashionable, stand Fran and Barry Weissler,
the mama and papa of this production, the producers. ``Look at all
the people here,'' Ms. Weissler says, smiling. ``And
(italics)we're(end italics) paying them.''
</P>
<P>
   The quip was striking because, in the 16 years that the
Weisslers have produced on Broadway, they have earned a reputation
for being _ among other things _ cheap. At last year's televised
Tony Awards, Rosie O'Donnell joked during a commercial break that
the Weisslers are ``the cheapest people in the free world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good sports,'' Ms. O'Donnell said subsequently. ``You
can tease them and they'll invite you to dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and colleagues of the Weisslers say this ability to
laugh at themselves has come to the husband-and-wife producing team
with time. The couple that started out driving their acting company
around to parochial schools in the Northeast in a station wagon and
U-Haul have, over the last several years, presented Broadway
revivals of ``Gypsy'' with Tyne Daly, ``My Fair Lady'' with Richard
Chamberlain and Melissa Errico, and ``Grease!'' with Ms. O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the success of ``Chicago'' _ their Broadway revival
that won six Tonys two years ago and has seven companies around the
world as well as two in rehearsal for Sweden and the Netherlands _
the Weisslers have hit the jackpot, becoming international
producers and earning not only millions of dollars but even the
grudging respect of some of their peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave them an artistic credibility they were looking for,''
said Nick Scandalios, executive vice president of the
theater-owning Nederlander Organization.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Weisslers seem to have entered the current
theater season with increasing confidence, mounting the revised
``Annie Get Your Gun'' (which opens on Thursday at the Marquis, a
Nederlander theater) and moving Kenneth Lonergan's acclaimed comic
play, ``This Is Our Youth,'' to a commercial run Off Broadway at
the Douglas Fairbanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's softening them a lot,'' said Ms. Errico, who played Eliza
Doolittle in ``My Fair Lady.'' ``They're not hungry in the same way
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone would agree. The Weisslers are still lightning rods
in the theater business, and people apparently either love them or
hate them. Those in the latter category say the Weisslers are
lowbrow and litigious and bully their employees. In dismissing the
couple on artistic grounds, their critics say the Weisslers prefer
to play it safe with revivals rather than develop productions from
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   According to this argument, the work on ``Chicago'' had already
been done for the 1996 production in the Encores concert musicals
series at City Center; the Weisslers simply moved the show to
Broadway more or less intact.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with many people in the theater industry, no one
would speak critically of the Weisslers on the record. The New York
theater world is a small one, and those who have clashed with the
Weisslers _ be they actors, directors, investors or potential
co-producers _ refuse to be quoted by name, given the possibility
that they may work with the couple in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In response to some of the criticisms, Weissler said in a recent
interview: ``Of course I care what my colleagues think of me. But I
won't live with the obsession that I want to be loved by all these
people. I want them to acknowledge Fran's and my work, but if they
don't, I'll go it alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being frugal gave us a reputation for being tight,'' he added.
``It's just not true. We're not profligate. We're trained in the
theater, so we put a value on things. We say: `This is what we
believe we can spend on this. Can you do it? If not, we'll go
somewhere else.'''
</P>
<P>
   Those who think well of the Weisslers suggest that some of the
criticism surrounding them is sour grapes because they are
self-made and have become multi-millionaires with ``Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Weisslers ``bring in their shows on budget and their shows
make money, which is practically unheard of in this business,''
said Rocco Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters, who has
co-produced several shows with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of Schadenfreude in this business and a
resentment of success.'' Landesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Plummer, who starred in the Weisslers' first
Broadway production, ``Othello,'' in 1982, said: ``Everybody talks
about how mean they are. I think all of us have been talking about
producers like that since Day One. They've never been mean to me.''

CELTICS DO A NUMBER ON MAGIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The only difficulty they found the entire night came
after the game was over. The Celtics couldn't decide which segment
of their 111-79 win over the Magic was, you know, The Best.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the democratic process. Forget about letting the
people determine which scene from the FleetCenter deserved to be
held above the others. There were 18,235 fans at the arena
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night. If you polled them, you would have a list of at
least 10 notable items. And if you happened to look at Rick
Pitino's Memorable Moments sheet, you would see that the coach did
even better than that. He had 32 reasons to smile about his team's
fourth win in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did they play great defense,'' the coach beamed of
the Celtics, ``but they were all passing the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   They passed and passed until they had accumulated a staggering
17 assists by halftime and 32 for the game. We'll get to that
later. But what Penny Hardaway must be wondering Thursday morning
is how his seven shots consistently passed the rim. That's right.
Hardaway, an All-Star guard, took seven shots and missed them all.
He didn't attempt any free throws, either. Zero points.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway sat in a locker stall afterward, saying he couldn't
ever remember going scoreless in a game. Ever. Not as a schoolboy
in Memphis. Not as a collegian in Memphis. Never as a pro.
Especially not during this season, when the Atlantic Division
leaders had won nine of their first 11 games. Hardaway had 28
points against the Celtics two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the warmups, I wasn't getting a sweat,'' he said. ``I
knew it was going to be a long night. I didn't have that fire in
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the Magic, who shot 35 percent from the field. The
Celtics obviously did. They led by a comparatively modest 50-35 at
halftime. After three quarters, things were ridiculous. It was
83-54. Ron Mercer, Antoine Walker, and Paul Pierce were on the
bench looking like millenial versions of M.L. Carr, smiling and
waving towels. They were getting excited about one of Eric Riley's
dunks.
</P>
<P>
   Which dunk was the best?
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a lot of good ones,'' Mercer said. ``It's hard to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   So what was the best pass?
</P>
<P>
   Well, most people would nominate the third-quarter sequence in
which Pierce stripped the ball from Bo Outlaw, dived on the floor
to retrieve it, threw it over his head to Mercer, who passed to
Walker, who finished the play by dunking in 2 of his 17 points.
Never mind that it was three passes. The trio got a standing
ovation for their work.
</P>
<P>
   But if you focused on that pass, you would have snubbed Dana
Barros's alley-oop to Mercer. Or Barros's pick-and-roll bounce pass
to Andrew DeClercq. Don't forget about Walker's no-looker to
DeClercq. Or the time Walker was on one side of the court with his
back to the basket and zipped a pass to the opposite corner for
Pierce, all set to take and make a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   And did we mention any of the eight assists by Kenny Anderson?
Walker and Anderson exchanged angry words Sunday in Washington.
They said the incident helped them. ``They were embarrassed by
it,'' said Pitino, who fined both players. They were so embarrassed
that they were obsessed with winning at practice for two days,
eager to show people that they are not the men they appeared to be
at the MCI Center.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson emerged from those practices energized. ``I was just
dragging up the court before,'' he said. ``I wasn't pushing the
ball or nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   He pushed Wednesday night. Pushed the ball and passed it. ``They
excite me,'' Anderson said of his passes. ``It's like being, um,
it's like sex, man. Really. When I get a pass to Antoine or Paul
Pierce cutting to the basket? That's like sex to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker wouldn't take it that far, but did say, ``I'm glad he
feels that way. He's a point guard.''
</P>
<P>
   So who was the best player?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all of them. The only 3-pointer Barros missed in six tries
was a desperation heave at the first-quarter buzzer. DeClercq was 7
of 9. Riley had a career-high 14 rebounds. Mercer rolled his left
ankle, sat for a while, then came back dunking and twisting his way
to 15 points. And then there was The Rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were all playing at his level right now,'' Walker said,
``we'd probably be leading the division.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce finished with 19 points, 6 rebounds, 5 steals, 3 blocked
shots, and 3 assists. He had talked with his mother in Los Angeles
earlier in the week. She told him that she was proud of the way he
was playing. He told her: ``Yeah, but I'd take wins over playing
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, he got both.

 NEW YORK: to me.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Both critics and fans of the Weisslers agree that they have
successfully bucked the tide by producing the old-fashioned way,
frequently in collaboration with other investors, at a time when
commercial Broadway theater is moving into the hands of corporate
titans like Disney. They also say the Weisslers are strong
personalities, a dying breed on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things this business is missing is the roguish
impresario characters,'' said Jed Bernstein, executive director of
the League of American Theaters and Producers, the trade
organization on whose executive board Weissler sits. ``Barry and
Fran are certainly larger than life and the theater needs
larger-than-life personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weissler _ Fran to most _ looks considerably younger than
her 70 years in her Escada coral and lime-green outfits,
pear-shaped diamond ring and manicured nails. She is the matriarch
of the operation. Rather than simply employing people, she adopts
them, taking an interest _ some might say meddling _ in their
personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fran likes to know what you eat, where you bought your
earrings, who you're in love with,'' Ms. Errico said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Weissler, 60, who is more formal than his wife,
though his friends say he has a shrewd sense of humor. Weissler
handles the business side of their company, National Artists
Management, affectionately dismissing his wife as someone who would
give the store away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you leave it to her, she just says yes to everything,'' he
said. The two acknowledge that they often disagree (he prevailed in
wanting to do ``Fiddler on the Roof'' when she didn't; she
prevailed in wanting to do ``Gypsy'' when he didn't; both shows won
Tonys for best revival).
</P>
<P>
   Some say the Weisslers have perfected a good-cop, bad-cop
dichotomy that belies their coordinated teamwork. While Ms.
Weissler may defer financial questions with, ``That's Barry's
department,'' they say, she is not a novice about money.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, people in the industry maintain, it is
typically Weissler's contentiousness that leads the couple into
court.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, for example, the Weisslers' company filed a $4 million
arbitration claim against Anthony Quinn for allegedly concealing a
heart condition that later invalidated insurance coverage for the
aborted 1989 national tour of the Lee Blessing play ``A Walk in the
Woods,'' when the actor was unable to perform.
</P>
<P>
   In their claim for breach of contract and fraud, the Weisslers
said they would not have produced the play if they had known that
Quinn ``suffered from significant cardiac illness.'' They were
awarded $450,000. Quinn said he had not known he suffered from
angina when he started working on the play.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Vinnette Carroll, who created and directed the
Weisslers' production of ``Your Arms Too Short to Box With God,''
charged them with failing to pay royalties. The case was settled
out of court.
</P>
<P>
   The Weisslers are still in litigation over their insurance on
``Busker Alley,'' the show that closed on the road in 1995 because
the star, Tommy Tune, fractured his foot.
</P>
<P>
   Weissler said that such disputes come with the territory. ``I'm
in business,'' he said. ``We do hundreds of millions of dollars a
year. There are bound to be legal ramifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people who have worked with the Weisslers argue that the
tenacity that makes the producers distasteful to some in the
industry is also the secret to their success. ``They're tough,''
said Walter Bobbie, the director of ``Chicago.'' ``Anybody has to
be to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the Weisslers' early experiences in trying to build their
business that seem to inform everything they do to this day. They
met in 1963, soon after Weissler had started his theater troupe,
the National Shakespeare Company, in New Jersey. Fran Weller spent
one day working in the box office in West Orange, N.J., to fill in
for a sick friend. The couple were married a year and a half later.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what originally attracted her to her second husband (she
has two children by her first and four grandchildren), Ms. Weissler
said that she surprised herself by falling for a short man with no
money and small hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was difficult, volatile, funny, romantic,'' she added. ``He
was a combination of a lot of things I hadn't had before.''
</P>
<P>
   Weissler was typically more circumspect. Speaking of their age
difference, he said: ``I love to be taken care of. We're just your
average husband and wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Weissler, who grew up in a suburb of Boston, and
Weissler, who grew up in Jersey City, are keenly aware of how far
they have come since those rough beginnings. So much so that even
though they appear to embrace the accouterments of success _ a
spacious apartment on Central Park West, elegant dinners out on the
town with prominent people _ they can still be made giddy by their
good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   They also guard it fiercely, knowing that _ given the perilous
risks of producing _ it could slip away from them at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We closed `Applause' out of town,'' Ms. Weissler said, ``and
`Busker Alley' went down the toilet; thank God we had `Grease!' on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then `Chicago' happened. Everybody forgets what came before,
and let them forget it. You're as good as your last show. It comes
with the territory. You want to go to Broadway, you want to play
with the big guys, you can't complain about it.''

 NEW YORK: about it.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some say that wanting to play with the big guys is a large part
of what makes the Weisslers so driven. ``There is the perception
among the initiated that they are outsiders, and I think they have
felt that,'' Landesman said. ``I don't think it is ever going to go
away because they have labored so long without what they have felt
to be general acceptance, always feeling they have to work twice as
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   To the degree that it is possible, the Weisslers have insulated
themselves against some of the vagaries of the business by
producing revivals that are more likely to appeal to a Broadway
audience and its tourists; by developing road companies that can be
an additional source of revenue; by building a full-time operation
_ including marketing, casting and development _ that is constantly
at work on future projects.
</P>
<P>
   From choosing costumes to editing programs to traveling out to
their road companies to watching rehearsals, the Weisslers are all
over their productions. ``Fran will go to auditions for every
chorus person that goes into a show,'' said Howie Cherpakov, the
Weisslers' associate casting director.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who work with them say the producers take pride in
developing talent and thereby inspire loyalty. ``They've been very
good to me,'' said Cherpakov, who started out as an intern in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, others say the couple have trouble keeping
employees because they berate them. ``If you go to any production
office, virtually everyone there has worked for the Weisslers,''
said the owner of a theater outside New York City who insisted on
anonymity. ``It's a revolving door.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weissler disagrees. ``Sometimes,'' she said, ``if you have
great assistants, they want to go further, but most of the major
people have stayed with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Weisslers are legendary for negotiating over the last sequin
and both acknowledge that they believe in finding ways to produce
for less.
</P>
<P>
   While musicals can cost more than $10 million these days,
``Annie Get Your Gun'' is expected to cost about $6 million. ``They
set out to do the best they can for the least amount of money for
the most amount of profit,'' Ms. O'Donnell said. ``And that's what
anyone in business tries to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Broadway competitors say the Weisslers save money at the
expense of their productions and that their frugality is why, for
example, ``Chicago,'' at about $3 million, was the show for them.
</P>
<P>
   In a business that is notorious for losing money, the Weisslers
maintain that their approach has paid off and that of the 20 shows
they have produced, they have made a profit on 14. The figures
cannot be confirmed because National Artists Management is
privately owned.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether they play it safe artistically, the Weisslers
counter with several arguments, starting with ``Falsettos.'' The
musical by William Finn, involving gay characters, was a gamble for
them on Broadway, although it is true that the show had been
produced before in two parts and the Weisslers simply combined them
into one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Busker Alley'' would have been a new Broadway production had
it traveled that far. Press reports at the time suggested that
Tune's foot fracture was an excuse to close a troubled show out of
town. ``Cornelia,'' a new play about the second wife of George
Wallace, the governor of Alabama, had been scheduled to arrive on
Broadway this season, directed by Jerry Zaks, but has been put off
to next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Weisslers said they have had difficulty casting the
production, written by Mark Victor Olsen, a first-time playwright.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the Weisslers say, revival should not be a dirty
word. ``Why is reviving `Annie Get Your Gun' any less noble than
doing `Macbeth'?'' Ms. Weissler asked. ``What is opera? What is
ballet? How great it is to preserve the classics and make them
new.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what the criticism of the Weisslers, there is a
mantra that people throughout the business recite: They get their
shows up and keep them running.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever they are or aren't,'' asserted Jay Binder, a casting
director who said he had been dismissed by Ms. Weissler on three
separate occasions, ``they've delivered.''

BC IS NO MATCH FOR SYRACUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It is almost over now. Twenty-five down. Two to go.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's 73-56 loss to the No. 24 Syracuse
Orangemen before a Conte Forum crowd of 4,165, that seemed to be
the only consolation for the Boston College men's basketball team
in its grueling torture test of a season. All that remains now for
the Eagles is a final regular-season game at Notre Dame Sunday
afternoon, then a likely rematch next week against the Orangemen in
the first round of the Big East tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Only then will the Eagles be able to look ahead to next season
with scarcely as much fear and trepidation as they did this season.
But Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night the Eagles (6-19 overall, 3-14 conference)
were forced to deal with the present, coming one game closer to
finishing last in the conference and earning the dreaded No. 13
seed in next week's conference tournament at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse's Etan Thomas did all he could to make that a certainty
by leading the Orangemen (19-9, 10-7) with a game-high 25 points,
including 18 in the first half, despite sitting out 14 minutes in
the second half with three fouls. Ryan Blackwell had 15 points and
9 rebounds while guard Jason Hart chipped in 15 with 4 assists and
7 steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, we tried to get the ball to Etan,'' said Syracuse
coach Jim Boeheim. ``He did his best job all year of posting up
strong, and when we missed, getting on the offensive glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who had nine rebounds and one blocked shot, helped
Syracuse outrebound BC, 49-20, which was two shy of the conference
record for rebounding margin. The Orangemen were so dominant they
had more offensive rebounds (21) than BC had total rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some nights when people are just better than you,
plain and simple,'' said BC coach Al Skinner. ``He created such a
mismatch for us that we attempted to compensate and made it easier
for everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   But not for sophomore guard Kenny Harley, who led BC with 20
points on 8-of-16 shooting, or for freshman forward Brian Ross, who
scored 11 points on 5-of-9 shooting but faced the unenviable task
of fronting Thomas in the low post. Though he is listed as 6 feet 8
inches, Thomas played as though he stood 7 feet, especially when
juxtaposed against BC's small frontcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big kid and very strong,'' said Ross. ``We're smaller
and not as strong as them, but when you play a guy like that you've
got to keep fighting. If we play them again we've just got to go
play harder next time, be more physical. To be honest, they just
beat us up.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take Thomas long to get into the groove, scoring
Syracuse's first 11 points. All in the low post.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 13-6, BC went on a 7-0 run to tie it, but Thomas went
to work down low and helped Syracuse surge to a 38-23 halftime
lead. The Orangemen came out in the second half and thrice led by
22 (48-26, 52-30, and 56-34) before BC pulled within 16 (64-48).
But that was as close as the Eagles would get as they absorbed yet
another loss and drew another game closer to calling it a season. A
very long season.

SONICS DO TEXAS TWO-SLIP, SHOOT BLANKS IN ALAMODOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Vin Baker sat alone in an empty locker with his
left eye just about closed.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics forward had been poked in the eye and discomfort was
evident by the redness. Even worse, Baker staggered around with
blurred vision, which was symbolic of the Sonics' 99-81 loss to the
San Antonio Spurs Wednesday night at the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight game, the Sonics stumbled around on
offense. And one has to wonder what they see because this team
cannot seem to locate the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't make free throws, we missed open shots. Same old
story,'' said Sonics coach Paul Westphal, whose team lost 98-86 at
Houston on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is time to put a suggestion box on Seattle street
corners. For the record, Westphal is willing to try just about
anything to invigorate an inept offense.
</P>
<P>
   That it was the Sonics' fourth loss in five games is enough for
concern. However, the team struggled through its worst shooting
night (34 percent) this season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Sonics (7-4) are downright mystifying.
</P>
<P>
   They were never really in this game. A late rally made the final
quarter interesting, but the Sonics were dominated by the Spurs'
frontline as David Robinson and Tim Duncan combined for 47 points
and 30 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Gary Payton's 20 points, the Sonics were flat. Detlef
Schrempf shot 2-for-8, Hersey Hawkins was 1-for-5 and Baker
suffered with 1-for-7 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need some confidence with guys making plays,'' Schrempf
said. ``Right now, we don't have confidence. It's off and on. We've
got to start rolling offensively. I'm sure we're looking at a lot
of different scenarios.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal actually tried to rewrite what has been an awful and
predictable script when the Sonics have had the ball this season.
He changed the starting lineup, inserting veteran Dale Ellis to
replace rookie Rashard Lewis at shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old Ellis hadn't started an NBA game since the
1996-97 season with the Denver Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things haven't been working too well. We've got to find some
scoring somewhere,'' Westphal said. ``Rashard did fine. We lost a
few, and it's time to go with the veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   The move was intended to give the Sonics an early scoring boost,
and it did. They shot 50 percent in the first quarter, and trailed
by only three.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Sonics fell apart, shooting a mere 30 percent
(18-for-60) the rest on the game.
</P>
<P>
   Since beating Utah at home Feb. 16, the Sonics have managed to
upend only the struggling Los Angeles Lakers. That was the only
time this season the Sonics benefited from balanced scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got starters who have made shots their whole careers,
and they're not making them,'' Westphal said. ``Why is a mystery to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were equally as bad at the foul line, sinking just 27
of 45.
</P>
<P>
   Baker missed all four of his free-throw attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was determined. Unfortunately, the eye really threw me off.
I kind of never got back in it because I was seeing double all
night,'' Baker said. ``It's disappointing. This team is doing
everything it can to win games, and I'm not playing well. I'm not
playing my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker's first field goal originated from the right low block.
With Duncan defending, Baker turned toward the baseline and made a
strong move toward the basket.
</P>
<P>
   However, that diligence didn't last long in the first half.
After attempting his second shot from the post, Baker started
launching from outside and missed four of his first five shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics still managed to stay close in the first half,
trailing 47-41 at the break. But they missed seven straight shots
at the start of the third quarter, many of them layups and
wide-open jump shots.
</P>
<P>
   The scoring drought lasted for five minutes until Payton hit a
short jump shot. Payton scored the Sonics' first six points in the
quarter, but his one-man act couldn't keep the Sonics from falling
behind 68-49 with 3:04 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Vladimir Stepania gave the Sonics their only spark when
he started the fourth quarter. Stepania, who was active on the
boards, finished with nine points. He was also effective defending
Robinson long enough to help the Sonics get within 87-77 with 3:05
left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But as good as Stepania was, he could not stay with Robinson the
entire period. The Spurs pulled away for good after Robinson dunked
the ball twice over Stepania in the game's last two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thankfully in the fourth quarter, two things happened: One, we
scored and two, we hit our free throws,'' Spurs coach Gregg
Popovich said. ``Those are the two things that have been tough for
us all year long.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Westphal, the Sonics are still dealing in the
present tense.

HUSKY BOOSTERS SHOULD THROW MONEY LAMBRIGHT'S WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the news conference in which Rick Neuheisel was announced
as University of Washington football coach, I asked Rob Aronson,
faculty representative and a member of the coaching search
committee, whether he expected former coach Jim Lambright to sue
the school.
</P>
<P>
   Aronson, in his fifth year as rep and familiar with the athletic
department, seemed taken aback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, no,'' he said. ``I don't think he would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Really?
</P>
<P>
   Makes one wonder what else was assumed by the UW search
committee. Maybe they figured Neuheisel knew the NCAA rule book,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who knows Lambright reasonably well had to know he wasn't
going to go down without an embarrassing public fight.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's story that he was dissatisfied with terms of his UW
settlement and was contemplating filing a lawsuit was as shocking
as wet shoes in February.
</P>
<P>
   It was classic Lambo _ stubborn, prideful, reckless, unthinking
and money-driven.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention divisive. His backers, and they are numerous and
wealthy, want the university and athletic director Barbara Hedges
to pay, in cash and image, for what is perceived to be an abrupt,
disloyal end to a noble Husky career.
</P>
<P>
   Even more numerous and wealthier are those who wanted him out.
They helped facilitate the hijacking of Neuheisel from Colorado,
and feel that the $276,000 settlement was more than Lambright
deserved, given how he imperiled the program with his political and
tactical blunders.
</P>
<P>
   In between, sort of, is Hedges. She was eager to see Lambright
gone, but now is equally eager to get him out of the headlines,
given how many headlines she's having to explain with her new hire.
</P>
<P>
   The football coaching change has had more snags than barbed wire
on panty hose, and guess what? Neuheisel's contract still isn't
done, more than six weeks after his hiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always takes a while for these things,'' Hedges said
Wednesday. ``It (the delay) really means nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if the crew hasn't controlled the old fire, it's
hard to bear down on the fresh flames.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the diplomat, Hedges avoided saying she wished Lambo would
go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (a lawsuit) is in anyone's best interests,'' she
said. ``He's taken the position he felt he needed to. That's the
only thing I can think or know.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedges said she is unable, by terms of Lambright's state
contract, to offer more than the maximum buyout ($176,000 for one
year's base salary, and a $100,000 annuity). And since the contract
says he can be fired at will, there is no dispute about the
university's rights.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, according to Lambright's Seattle attorney, Tracy
Codd, is the way it was done _ with no public indication of
trouble. Hedges' unqualified endorsement of Lambright in November
led the coach to believe he was secure. If Lambright had known of
the jeopardy, Codd said, he might have sought another job during
the narrow window of annual coaching openings.
</P>
<P>
   There's also some thought that, since Lambright's final contract
extension was not completed and signed until January 1998, after
the Aloha Bowl win against Michigan State and six months after
negotiations started, the ax had been out for a while. Codd
speculates there may be grounds for a violation of contract law
called fraud in the inducement.
</P>
<P>
   The merits of any case, if filed, are unknowable. What is known
is that Lambright is hacked off and the university by law can't
appease him, even though numerous other settlements involving
Division I coach firings are for much more money.
</P>
<P>
   The irony, undoubtedly lost on Lambright, is that he is seeking
the same kind of respect and appreciation that he failed to accord
Shane Fortney and Nick Lentz, two players who left the program
because of Lambright decisions, yet were denigrated publicly and
privately by Lambright.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Hedges and her booster backers need to consider
the trouble an embittered Lambright will make. His is a
black-and-white world where you are with him or against him, where
loyalty and betrayal are his primary, if not exclusive, definers of
behavior. Don't expect compromise or subtle persuasion to work.
</P>
<P>
   If athletic department money is unavailable, the boosters who
encouraged his ouster might give serious consideration to passing
the hat among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware of anything like that going on,'' Hedges said.
``It certainly could be done, as long as it's private money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person was interested in doing that, I'd encourage them
to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   By law and perhaps by conscience, Lambright doesn't deserve
more. But the the athletic department's million-dollar decision to
hire Slick Rick has sufficiently irritated the college football
nation to the point that the purple throngs are finding trouble
where they never imagined it.
</P>
<P>
   The Lambright dilemma needs to be in the past, and there is one
tried-and-true business solution: Throw money at it.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like the athletic department isn't familiar with the
trick.

   1. COLONEL QADDAFI IN HIS TENT A Western journalist travels to
Libya for an exclusive interview with Colonal Mu'ammar Qaddafi and
finds a country struggling to modernize. Tired of suffering under
the U.N. embargo, Libya may be ready to hand the suspected
Lockerbie bombers over for trial. After being pariahs for over a
decade, most Libyans seem eager to re-enter the international
community. But power in their country is divided between
bureaucrats who favour the West and the old, fiercely anti-colonial
revolutionaries who still cherish Qaddafi's defiance. By Milton
Viorst. From Foreign Affairs magazine. 2,000 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 2.
THE GOALS OF CHINA'S GROWING MILITARY STRENGTH Whether or not China
becomes a global threat in the future is irrelevant to its
activities in Asia today. China is definitely on the move, and its
full intentions are far from clear. James Webb, secretary of the
U.S. navy under President Reagan, discusses China's growing
military strength. New York Times Op-Ed. 1,000 words. 3. STUDY
FINDS LITTLE RISK OF CANCER FROM CARCINOGENS
</P>
<P>
   IN COOKED MEAT People who eat more meat have higher rates of
colon and rectal cancers, two of the most common causes of cancer
death. But just why eating more meat increases a person's risk of
cancer is unknown. One theory holds that chemicals formed when meat
is fried, grilled or roasted at high temperatures are to blame. But
Swedish researchers now report that they could find no strong link
between cancer rates and the amount of these chemicals people ate
in their diet. By Michael McCarthy. The Lancet News Service. 1,000
words.
_______________________________________________________________ 4.
AMERICA SPEAKS LOUDLY BUT ISN'T AT ALL SURE There is a remarkable
gap between the role America seems to seek in the world when it
talks of leadership and a new ``strategic concept'' for NATO to
meet an assortment of global challenges and how Americans see
themselves. The end of the Cold War hasn't brought any clear idea
of what to do now. By Flora Lewis. 800 words.

   A. SOME RARE PEOPLE SEE A SOUND AND HEAR A COLOUR Some people
have a rare condition called synesthesia, in which the customary
boundaries between the senses appear to break down, sight mingling
with sound, or taste with touch (e.g. the number 5 is seen as
yellow; the month of January as red.) The arrival of imaging
techniques and other new technologies for studying the brain at

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: GORE BECOMES A PUNDIT'S PEN PAL
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Feb. 28.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In ramping up for his coming presidential race, Al
Gore has sent a two-page letter to more than 100,000 people,
inviting them to become members of his ``National Steering
Committee'' _ a group that will never meet and has no formal
duties.
</P>
<P>
   The mailing, a Gore spokesman said, was targeted at folks who
have contributed to President Clinton's past campaigns. Although as
a working journalist I've never given any politician a dime, I made
the cut.
</P>
<P>
   True, I've contributed to charities and schools that also
interest Gore and his wife. (Charitable giving has been a sore
topic for Gore since last April, when Republicans branded him
``Vice President Scrooge'' for donating only $353 to charity on
1997 income of $197,729.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore's lifestyle remains well beyond the reach of most
millionaires. His cocoon comes complete with a mansion, planes,
cars and bodyguards, all courtesy of the taxpayers. (When Gore's
charitable gifts for 1998 and 1999 come to light, you can bet
they'll top $353.)
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always thus. When Harry Truman served in the vice
presidency, he lived in an apartment that's a five-minute walk from
my home. Old-timers recall Truman strolling and shopping in the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the letter (prepared by Gore 2000 Inc. and crafted
by the unionized Allied Printing Trades Council on recycled paper)
does make a stab at human contact. He concludes, ``I need your
advice.'' So here goes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Your advisers say that you'll need to put some political
distance between yourself and the president to highlight ``the Gore
agenda.'' Don't. You're forever joined at the hip to Bill Clinton.
To act otherwise will make you look like a phony.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prepare for the day that Ken Starr comes after your old pal
Nathan Landow. As your longtime top fund raiser, Landow got into
Starr's sights for allegedly pressuring Clinton volunteer Kathleen
Willey to clam up. (When called before Starr's grand jury, he took
the Fifth.) Perhaps you'll get off the hook if Attorney General
Janet Reno finds a way to shut Starr down.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ditch ``Earth in the Balance,'' your 1992 best-seller in which
you wrote that ``the froth and frenzy of industrial civilization
mask our deep loneliness.'' Jimmy Carter took a huge hit for his
``malaise'' speech; the same thing could happen to you. For the
1992 campaign, your staff wrote an internal memo warning you that
to equate ``the failure to recycle aluminum cans with the
Holocaust,'' as you did in your book, shows ``no sense of
proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep laughing at yourself before most audiences. But ease up
on the ``I'm-a-stiff'' jokes: They cut too close to the bone.
Successful pols usually marry their public and private personas. So
should you.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, you took it in stride when my son beat out your
daughter by one vote to become president of the joint school
government club. (She got to serve as his vice president.) Now,
I'll take no offense at being tagged as a ``good friend to the
president and me'' if you'll buy the notion that pundits should
look out solely for the best interests of their readers.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Congress tries to buy enlistments
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, Feb. 28, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not surprising that the Congress last week quickly and
overwhelmingly passed a healthy pay and benefits increase for our
people in the Armed Forces. Statistics showed that enlistments and
re-enlistments in the military were woefully low.
</P>
<P>
   It is reported that the branches of our military will need about
200,000 new enlistments this year alone _ and the chances of
achieving that are not good.
</P>
<P>
   But any thought that a slightly larger paycheck is going to get
a person to join, or one to re-up, is to miss the real point of why
so many are declining to remain: Someone could get killed out
there.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. has become unbridled in its use of U.S. troops around
the world. After frosty experiences in Bosnia, our young men and
women in uniform now face the possibility of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we remain pitiably exposed in the Middle East,
exposed to germ warfare, missiles and terrorism. The Iraq situation
involves actual combat as well as jeopardy on a daily basis
</P>
<P>
   Being in the Army or the Navy isn't exactly as it is depicted in
those TV ads during football games. Indeed, you do see the world
and you can get a college education, but lately Army life has been
in full battle gear rather than on a day's leave or in a classroom.
</P>
<P>
   This is not meant to detract from the fact that our military was
in need of, and had earned, those increased paychecks and benefits
from the government. With all those billions and billions of
dollars being devoted to pork, waste and mismanagement, what's
wrong with throwing a few billion into the hands of soldiers,
sailors, Marines and airmen?
</P>
<P>
   Our worldwide adventures in the guise of stopping communism,
dictators, drug dealers and warlords have exposed U.S. troops to
previously uncharted territories, and it has not always been
supported by the U.S. people.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers have little choice; they are sent.
</P>
<P>
   What choice they do have is to decide whether to re-enlist. As
President Clinton, without benefit of congressional approval, moves
his soldiers around the globe to put out what he considers to be
critical fires, the chances of major losses loom.
</P>
<P>
   Military spokesmen claim young men and women no longer think of
the military when planning careers, but let's be realistic: For a
great number of America's youth, joining the military is a way out
of a hard civilian life. Not all of us can become rocket
scientists, lawyers or presidents. So many join up. Or, rather,
many did join up.
</P>
<P>
   But with the authority of presidents to commit troops to foreign
conflicts, even over the protests of usually opposition-party
congressmen and women, the element of physical danger increases
dramatically. Eighteen-year-old kids do not savor the idea of
signing up to make themselves available for dangerous duty in a
desert half a world away.
</P>
<P>
   So intense was the Congress to pass this legislation that it
broke down all political and budgetary barriers. The few who
questioned the move did not do so in opposition to military pay
raises but did by questioning where the money was coming from.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about it, the protagonists insisted, we'll get it.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm certain they will, just as Ronald Reagan got all that
money to build up our military nearly two decades ago _ from a
money-printing machine.
</P>
<P>
   Money is not going to bloat our military ranks. What we really
need to question is why we need such a large military complement.
When do we stop being the world's policemen? What is the threat to
the U.S. by civil war action in Yugoslavia between ethnic Serbs and
Albanians?
</P>
<P>
   When youngsters join the service, they rarely think they are
going to be killed, yet when they step across the line at the
recruitment station, their lives do belong to someone else.
Soldiers should not be surprised, or disillusioned, if they are
sent off to war; that's why they're there in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   But what needs to be examined, also, is why we go off to so many
murky wars, so many that are not our wars. If we're really trying
to find out why enlistment and re-enlistment is down, the answer is
not in a paycheck; it's in our policy.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Gun industry, you can save yourself
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a great idea for gun manufacturers, though they won't
think so right away: Their industry should start thinking about
supporting national gun control.
</P>
<P>
   No, really.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the industry faces a growing chaos of federal, state
and city regulations and laws _ and lawsuits, too _ whose
inconsistency and often ad hoc nature pester and confuse legitimate
owners, aid criminals by creating as many cracks as barriers and
nudge the manufacturers themselves into strategies that threaten in
the long run to be their own undoing.
</P>
<P>
   The long-standing but inanimate public support for control is
finally beginning to exert itself.
</P>
<P>
   A Brooklyn jury recently bought the argument, and brought in a
$4 million judgment for seven victim families, that 15 major gun
makers were legally negligent for flooding low-regulation states
with firearms they had to know would be smuggled to black markets
in strong-control states. Ninety percent of the guns criminals use
in New York state are bought elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   A number of cities, bloodied by gun violence, are filing similar
suits, and the NAACP is thinking of joining in to give the claims
some national oomph. And gun-control organizations, like Handgun
Control, have acquired enough political and lobbying savvy and
popular support that they've pretty much established a standoff
with the gun lobby in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has even managed to get two useful bills
enacted _ the Brady law and the ban on military-style assault
weapons _ and seems likely to win funding to add 10 cities to his
successful program in 27 that is tracing guns used by young
criminals back to their buyers. (Contrary to myth, most weapons
used by youths are not stolen but were bought for the kid market by
straw buyers.)
</P>
<P>
   Blocked in Congress, the National Rifle Association, the
manufacturers' faithful dogsbody, is resorting to frantic measures
in state legislatures, where its money still talks. Georgia's
Legislature has passed a law forbidding its cities to sue the
industry, and blocking bills are pending in nine other states.
</P>
<P>
   The industry as well is resorting to what look like desperate
means. With hunting slumping in an ever less rural America,
manufacturers increased the number of pistols they produced by 92
percent between 1985 and '93 and upped the firing speed and
caliber. Some are now making so-called ``pocket rockets'' _ small,
lightweight, easily concealed and still more powerful than older
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   It is inconceivable that the public will put up with this
escalation forever. The backlash, when it hits, could be furious
both in legislatures and the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be better to act before the human damage piles up
still higher? It is perfectly possible to draw national firearms
regulations that equally recognize the legitimate interests of
owners and protect public safety.
</P>
<P>
   (And thus incidentally secure a predictable and durable market
for the business itself, but it's OK if Colt, Smith &AMP; Wesson and
the rest don't thank me for that.)

HILLARY VS. BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  By William Saletan 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Hillary Clinton runs for the U.S. Senate in New York next
year, she'll have two crucial advantages. One is that her last name
is Clinton. The other is that her first name isn't Bill.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging spin behind her candidacy is that she's her
husband's moral opposite: She's been his victim, she's been
faithful and now it's ``her turn.'' But that's only one dimension
in which the Clintons differ. Republicans who oppose Hillary
Clinton's candidacy are gearing up to exploit another difference:
her comparative liberalism on matters of policy.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Republican attacks on Hillary Clinton's involvement
in Whitewater and Filegate might have hurt her. But nowadays
talking about those scandals reminds people less of the Clintons'
suspicious behavior than of the GOP's impeachment jihad. Indeed,
part of the logic behind her candidacy is to ride the
anti-impeachment backlash. ``Mrs. Clinton would serve as a constant
reminder of the GOP effort to oust her husband,'' observes the Wall
Street Journal. She ``could help drive Democratic voters to the
polls,'' sweeping several of New York's congressional Republicans
out of office.
</P>
<P>
   A scandal-based Republican attack would only make things worse.
``If their campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton is to simply be
an extension of the Starr investigation,'' Sen. Bob Torricelli,
D-N.J., the Democrats' Senate campaign chairman, warned on ``Meet
the Press,'' ``they're going to take a sizable Hillary lead and
make it into a rout.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that the public remains angry at Mrs. Clinton's
husband. But the genius of her candidacy is that she gets to ride
that backlash, too. Her ``advisers'' told the New York Times that
she's ``very enticed by the idea of at last having an independent
voice, particularly after her husband ... publicly humiliated her''
last year. This story line plays to moralists as well as to
feminists. If you're mad at the president, the argument goes,
support the woman he cheated on.
</P>
<P>
   The media have fallen head over heels for this spin. ``Her
Turn,'' says Newsweek's cover. ``A Race of Her Own,'' agrees Time.
A New York Times editorial says her candidacy ``could allow her to
untangle herself from the political side of her marriage and
compete for a power base that is all her own. Many women might ante
up a campaign contribution just in the hopes of seeing Mrs. Clinton
sworn in on the day that her husband becomes unemployed. ... If the
President announces that it is now Hillary's turn to shine, and his
to take on the jobs of campaign cheerleader and family breadwinner,
even many of the couple's critics would agree it is about time.''
</P>
<P>
   The pose of the wronged but ever-faithful wife also helps
Hillary Clinton in two other ways. It raises her to an even higher
pedestal, prompting the media to ask not whether she's up to the
job of senator but whether she's too good for it. Meanwhile, the
pedestal lifts her above the charge of carpetbagging. Torricelli
says she ``would be part of a great tradition'' of icons who have
used New York's Senate seats as a ``platform'' from which to
``enlighten the whole nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton's likely Republican opponent, New York Mayor
Rudy Giuliani, understands the peril of the impeachment mess and is
wisely steering clear of it. ``I was one who didn't believe that
(President Clinton) should have been impeached, so no, I would not
bring it up,'' the mayor declared on ``This Week.'' Instead, he
vowed to confront his likely foe on ``issues'' such as taxes,
welfare reform, national health insurance and her advocacy of a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Superficially, Giuliani's argument is that she's too liberal.
But he has added a clever twist to the argument, turning Hillary
Clinton's strategy on its head. She's different from her husband,
all right, says the mayor. The difference is that she's out of the
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   On ``This Week,'' Giuliani twice likened his own views to those
of Clinton and contrasted them with Hillary's more radical views.
On the Middle East, said Giuliani, ``I'm in the same position as
the White House, and Mrs. Clinton is out there much more heavily
favoring the Palestinians.'' Later, when asked about his initiative
to require homeless people to get jobs or leave their homeless
shelters, Giuliani said the initiative ``emerges from the mandates
of the welfare reform bill that was signed by President Clinton.
And what it says is that when you seek shelter ... we will engage
you in a process of trying to find work for you as opposed to
letting you become dependent.'' As for Hillary Clinton, the mayor
allowed, ``She may be in a different position.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's strategists worry openly about this line of
attack. ``Let's say she disagrees with her husband on trade
policy,'' one member of her team told the Times. ``It will be
trumpeted as a big deal.'' In a mock strategy memo published in
Newsweek, former Clinton adviser George Stephanopoulos asked her,
``What if the president undercuts your most effective campaign
issue by making a deal with Republicans on partial privatization of
Social Security and tax cuts? Will you take a stand or stand by
your man?''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies her dilemma. On ``Meet the Press,'' former Nixon
strategist Bill Safire explained how she could beat the extremism
rap. ``She can do what her husband has done over the years, and
that is reassess things. ... She can make a visit to Israel, be
embraced, get a lot of pictures over there, and move from the left
(toward) the center,'' talking more ``about getting people off
welfare and balancing budgets.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli is already working on this script, saying Clinton
``would make very clear that she supports this peace process ...
from the perspective of an administration that has probably been
more helpful to Israel and its security than any president in
American history.'' One step to the left, two steps to the right.
That's what people love about her husband's politics--and what they
hate about his character.

THE UNSINKABLE ELIZABETH TAYLOR 
</HEADLINE>
  Includes a color slide of Liz Taylor before her 1997 birthday party
and a black-and-white print of the actress in ``Cat on a Hot Tin
Roof.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    She's one of the most famous women in the world, and on Feb. 27
she'll turn 67. She's lived virtually her whole life in the
spotlight, in a dog-eat-dog world where cynics abound.
 &HT;    Yet, her current boyfriend says, ``I'm amazed that for a person
who has been out there since she was 9 years old, she's so trusting
and naive _ in the best sense of the word.''
 &HT;    Oscar-winning actor Rod Steiger is talking about his friend
Elizabeth Taylor, and he insists that _ despite her much-chronicled
trials and tribulations, her many husbands and consorts, her
numerous health crises, the acres of newsprint devoted to her
so-called scandals _ ``She has not become a hardened person.''
 &HT;    The couple have become close friends, dodging the paparazzi to
slip away for a quiet lunch each week.
 &HT;    Their relationship began, Steiger says, when he met her to
discuss a film script and was stunned to discover that, except for
AIDS fundraisers, she hadn't been out to lunch in two years.
 &HT;    Despite the gossip columns, however, the actor insists that he
and the much-wed Taylor are not contemplating marriage.
 &HT;    ``Some of the papers have played it up as heavy romance,'' he
says. ``I have a great deal of respect for her and her courage.
We've both had a lot of pain _ we are sympatico.''
 &HT;    So much so in fact that, in her late 60s, Taylor is going back
to work to star opposite Steiger in a modestly budgeted movie
entitled ``Somewhere,'' which Steiger will direct.
 &HT;    The actor calls it, ``a little picture about Dorothy later in
life, wanting to go back to Oz at the age of 60.''
 &HT;    At 67, Taylor is bouncing back from her most recent back
problems and minor sinus surgery. At last count she has had more
than 30 major surgeries.
 &HT;    ``Elizabeth uses hospitals the way other people use resorts,''
her second husband, Michael Wilding, once said _ and that was when
she was still in her 20s.
 &HT;    Today Taylor is looking well again. She stays actively involved
with her AIDS charity work, and continues her efforts to promote
her signature White Diamonds and Passion perfumes.
 &HT;    Her seesaw life continues to captivate the world. One week she's
fat, the next week she's thin. One week she's glamorous in diamonds
and designer duds, the next she's in an ambulance being rushed to a
hospital. One minute she's giving an impassioned speech about AIDS,
the next she's flashing her $4 million diamond ring as if she'd
never had a serious thought in her life.
 &HT;    Taylor has made her whole life a study in how not to mature.
When she hit 60 she invited her assorted pals to live it up with
her _ at Disneyland. At 65 she was thrown a huge, celebrity-studded
birthday bash which became a television special to benefit AIDS.
 &HT;    And still she's the center of the tabloid universe. Whether it's
her relationship with Steiger or her public display of concern
after her former husband, 47-year-old Larry Fortensky, fell down
the stairs at his home and sustained a brain injury.
 &HT;    But privately she mostly stays home in her $5 million Bel Air
mansion, meeting with producers and filmmakers who want to entice
her back to the big and small screen. And she enjoys visits from
her extended family, grandkids and all.
 &HT;    She has little left to prove, having already lived enough for
six lifetimes. She's won Oscars for ``Butterfield 8'' (1960) and
``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf'' (1966) and made dozens of other
movies, some of them great, some not so great. She's made
headlines, some good and some embarrassing. She's dumped husbands
and lovers and given us a vicarious ride with her yachts, her
jewels, her kids and her animals.
 &HT;    And with all that, it's been hard for us to accept that the
gorgeous little 9-year-old who showed up on screen in ``National
Velvet'' (1944) is on the Medicare rolls.
 &HT;    Elizabeth Taylor Hilton Wilding Todd Fisher Burton Warner
Fortensky is no longer a box-office star. Yet she's a huge draw
when she makes personal appearances to peddle her perfumes or to
raise money to help lick the disease that killed her longtime
friend Rock Hudson.
 &HT;    The last film she starred in was the television movie ``Sweet
Bird of Youth'' (1989). The last time she worked on the big screen,
it was a mere cameo role in ``The Flintstones'' (1994).
 &HT;    Yet the world is apparently endlessly fascinated by this woman,
even if her main claim to fame these days is that she's more famous
for being famous than any other woman in the world.
 &HT;    She keeps bouncing back, more than earning her title of
Hollywood's Queen of Survival: There's not much she can't handle,
not even that curse of great beauties everywhere, aging.
 &HT;    ``I feel the same inside,'' she says. ``But, you know, that's
because I don't look in the mirror much. It depends on how I feel
in the morning on any given day. But I don't look back _ only
forward.''
 &HT;    She says she tries to think positively.
 &HT;    ``I don't live with regret in my life,'' Taylor says. ``I really
don't say, `Oh God, I wish I hadn't been under contract.' I don't
live to regret any of it. It's too late, anyway. I didn't realize
I'd go along for so long _ I'm like a bad penny, hard to get rid
of.''
 &HT;    She laughs.
 &HT;    ``I don't watch my old movies,'' she adds. ``No way. I never
look at them, and if one comes on TV I switch off quickly. It makes
me very self-conscious.''
 &HT;    Perhaps in her late 60s, forgoing the grand passions that always
seemed to get her in so much trouble, she seems to be settling for
companionship. At least that's what Steiger thinks.
 &HT;    ``We're like a couple of old gunfighters _ Wild Bill Hickok and
Wyatt Earp,'' the actor says. ``We've both been through a lot of
crap. I believe talented people should help and protect each other.
Whenever we see each other we have a nice time, because we've both
been there _ and back.''

 &HT;    Spanish coin gives a clue to state's past
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. SIMONS ISLAND, Ga. _ Robertson Shinnick has found a tiny
piece of Georgia's past _ lost for more than 300 years.
</P>
<P>
   Searching the ground on this resort isle with a metal detector
last fall, the 33-year-old coin collector dug a foot into the black
soil and found an odd-shaped coin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had in my hand a small, squarish piece of copper with a
strange design on it,'' Shinnick said. ``I knew the Spanish
colonial mints struck millions of silver coins, but this was
obviously copper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mystery until I identified the design as the monogram
of Philip IV of Spain, who reigned from 1621 to 1665.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out the four-maraved coin, a low-value sort of penny of
its era, had been hand-forged in Spain about 1658. It isn't
particularly dear to collectors _ it's worth about $65 _ but it's
valuable to Georgia historians.
</P>
<P>
   John Worth, director of programs for the Calhoun-based
Coosawattee Foundation and one of the top experts on 17th century
Spanish missions along the Georgia coast, calls the coin ``quite a
find.'' He says Shinnick's coin gives a clue about the long-lost
mission of Santo Domingo de Asajo, built in 1595 to convert Native
Americans to Christianity. It was destroyed by English-backed slave
traders in 1661, rebuilt a year later, then burned by British
pirates in 1684.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were about 30 men, women and children, and friars, but
no soldiers. A small garrison of soldiers was located on nearby St.
Catherine's Island,'' Worth says.
</P>
<P>
   Other traces of the early Spanish period, such as olive jars and
pottery shards, have been found on St. Simons, says Worth, who's
done extensive studies on the island. But coins such as the one
Shinnick found are rare along the Georgia coast. Shinnick's may be
the first found on St. Simons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its significance is in our common state heritage,'' Worth
says. ``It is a bit of actual, concrete evidence of the Spanish
missions, right here in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Shinnick, a bellman at the King and Prince Resort, found the
coin on private land at Hampton Point, where million-dollar
mansions are being built.
</P>
<P>
   One side of the time-blackened coin shows the royal monogram of
Philip IV and a Roman numeral for the denomination. The other shows
the letters ``RX'' _ for ``rex,'' or ``king,'' according to Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the friars couldn't touch coins, my best guess is it
was dropped by a passing soldier or an Indian,'' says Worth, whose
Coosawattee Foundation aims to protect former Native American sites
in the Southeast. ``It's just a good history lesson from an era
that's been lost.''

   BOX INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
   Generations of Georgians know the state was founded by James
Oglethorpe, a British general, some 50 years before the American
Revolution. Less well-know is that Spain established missions here
more than 150 years earlier, beginning in 1565, some 42 years
before the English established the Jamestown colony in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   _ At least 10 missions were established by the Spanish on St.
Simons, St. Catherines, Sapelo, Jekyll and Cumberland Island.
</P>
<P>
   _ On St. Catherine's Island, scientists have unearthed 430 human
remains, household dishes, musket shot, rosary beads, wheat for
Eucharist flatbread and thousands of beads for trading. Also,
silver and gold religious medallions, minted at the Vatican, have
been found.
</P>
<P>
   _ After fleeing St. Simons in the late 1600s, the Spanish
returned and attacked Fort Frederica, which had been established by
Oglethorpe. At the Battle of Bloody Marsh, not far from the present
King and Prince Resort Hotel, the Spanairds were defeated, and in
1763, swapped holdings from St. Simons to St. Augustine for the
British in exchange for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1821, Spanish Florida formally came under control of the
United States.

 &HT;    The fact of the matter is ...
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Here are some little known facts sent to me that
would no doubt make even Cliff Claven say, ``I didn't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Shakespeare's time, mattresses were secured on bed frames by
ropes, and when you pulled on the ropes the mattress tightened,
making the bed firmer to sleep on. That's where the phrase,
``goodnight, sleep tight'' came from.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence ``The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog''
uses every letter in the alphabet (developed by Western Union to
test telex communications).
</P>
<P>
   The only 15 letter word that can be spelled without repeating a
letter is uncopyrightable.
</P>
<P>
   When opossums are playing 'possum, they are not ``playing.''
They actually pass out from sheer terror.
</P>
<P>
   The Main Library at Indiana University sinks over an inch every
year because when it was built, engineers failed to take into
account the weight of all the books that would occupy the building.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``the whole 9 yards'' came from WWII fighter pilots in
the Pacific. When arming their airplanes on the ground, the .50
caliber machine gun ammo belts measured exactly 27 feet, before
being loaded into the fuselage. If the pilots fired all their ammo
at a target, it got ``the whole 9 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``rule of thumb'' is derived from an old English law
which stated that you couldn't beat your wife with anything wider
than your thumb.
</P>
<P>
   An ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain.
</P>
<P>
   The name Jeep came from the abbreviation used in the army for
the ``General Purpose'' vehicle, G.P.

 &HT;    Algae? Hay? Romantic? Makes scents, says French perfumer (whose
nose obviously knows)
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fl.a _ Jean-Paul Guerlain can smell you.
</P>
<P>
   Get within spitting distance, and he just can't help it. Got
deodorant? Apply liberally. Nothing, not even garbage in Manhattan
in July, insults his nostrils like a case of B.O.
</P>
<P>
   Guerlain is known as the ``nose'' of his family's famous
Paris-based perfume business. He recognizes thousands of scents and
has created 14 perfumes (among them Shalimar), the formulas for
which, until recently, he kept in a safe. And only he could open
it.
</P>
<P>
   His talent is not so much physical _ ``He doesn't have a bionic
nose,'' his publicist warns _ as mental. Growing up nearly blind,
he was called on by his grandfather to memorize the smells of
jasmine, sandalwood and other materials and become a company
catalog of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Guerlain, now 62, calls himself a master perfumer. ``There are
not more than 10 or 12 in the world who deserve the title,'' he
sniffs.
</P>
<P>
   He visited his Palm Beach boutique at The Breakers last week
(where one 1 ounce of his Vega costs $1,200) and had a few minutes
to chat. It was his first trip to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: How many smells can you recognize?
</P>
<P>
   A.: A girl who worked with me for 35 years once counted all the
smells I really remember. She arrived at about 3,000. People are
always amazed by that. But the Chinese and Japanese know ten
thousands of writing characters. Surely, that's more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: When did you first know you had a great nose?
</P>
<P>
   A.: When I was 16. I was more or less blind. I was really unable
to go down the staircase. My grandfather said to my father, ``Send
him to my place.'' I would go every afternoon to the factory. He
put me in a room with 100 raw materials and said, ``Try to memorize
them.'' Every evening, he would dip a blotter (he waves his hand in
front of his nose) and ask, ``What's that?'' Then, one day, he gave
me a bottle of perfume and said, ``Try and do something like
that.'' He called my father and said, ``It's not your eldest son
who will work with me; it's Jean-Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Can you see now?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Now I am able to see. I had 17 operations. The last one, the
18th, was only five years ago. I still suffer in a lot of light.
(The day is overcast, but he wears sunglasses.)
</P>
<P>
   Q.: What scent do you wear?
</P>
<P>
   A.: The lady with whom I'm in love wishes me to wear Derby (a
Guerlain perfume). We've been together for 14 years. I created
Samsara for her.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: What smell do you wake up to?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I always travel with a bottle of her perfume. First thing, I
take and smell it. And I never go to sleep without smelling
something.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: What does Florida, or Palm Beach, smell like?
</P>
<P>
   A.: I must say not much.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: What are the most romantic scents?
</P>
<P>
   A.: The ocean, surely, with the algae. New-mown hay. And what I
smell when I go through India _ jasmine, the pepper, the coffee.
India is the most romantic because everything smells.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Have you ever had odd requests to use your nose?
</P>
<P>
   A.: When I was young, a researcher working on mushrooms brought
me his collection and asked me to try to identify their smells. I
was quite amazed by the question.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Did you do it anyway?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Do you do anything special to take care of your nose?
</P>
<P>
   A.: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Are you allergic to anything?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Stupid women. And garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Can you ``turn off'' your nose?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Unfortunately not. I think it's worse when I'm in a
restaurant _ this happens unfortunately too often _ and the server
has a bad perspiring smell. And since I don't smoke anymore, I'm
disturbed by the tobacco smell.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: Can you tell things about people by their smell?
</P>
<P>
   A.: No, but by their perfume, yes. You can tell a girl by her
perfume.
</P>
<P>
   Q.: An example?
</P>
<P>
   A.: (Pause) No, I don't want to get into a mess. (Smiles.)
</P>
<P>
   Q.: How would you compare the smell of Americans and the French?
</P>
<P>
   A.: Americans will buy what the best salesgirl convinces them to
buy. Many buy the latest perfume and don't even smell it. A pity.
They give too much importance to the advertising, not the quality
of the liquid inside. The French say, ``A meal without wine and
cheese is like a day without the sun.'' Perfume is very important.
When you switch off the light, it's the only thing left but the
charm of her voice.

 &HT;    Katz decamps, reaps `Mountain' of rewards
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some men deal with midlife by buying new sports cars
and shedding wives. Jon Katz bought a ramshackle cabin on a
mountain and read books by the Trappist monk Thomas Merton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't really a midlife crisis,'' says Katz, a contributing
editor for Rolling Stone and the author of the Suburban Detective
mystery series. ``The only crisis was that it dawned on me I was
entering the final stage of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he admits, it was quite a comfortable life. As a free-lance
writer, he had spent several years looking after his daughter while
his wife worked as a reporter for The Washington Post. He carpooled
so much he became known as ``the Prince of Rides.'' Once his
daughter turned 17 and was getting ready for college, that part of
his life was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't want to continue to write the same mysteries
and do the same things I had always done,'' Katz says. ``More and
more we had drifted into the baby boomer habit of defining
ourselves by our children, rather than by the things we ourselves
were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in the summer of 1997, Katz ignored the advice of his wife
and friends and left his suburban New Jersey home to spend six
months in a cabin in upstate New York. He chronicles his
experiences in ``Running to the Mountain: A Journey of Faith and
Change'' (Villard, $20).
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did, although I didn't realize it at the time, is a
bigger fantasy for middle-aged men than sex. They would come up to
me and say, `What you did is what I want to do.' They're harried,
they're worried about their parents and their kids. They don't want
to spend the rest of their life being hassled.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz admits his timing couldn't have been worse. His daughter
was getting ready to leave for college, his house needed extensive
repairs and his free-lance writing career was as risky as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely could not afford it,'' Katz says, ``but I thought
if I didn't do this, I didn't know what I would do. My wife
reluctantly agreed when she saw how important this was to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz was prepared to spend a lot of time repairing the cabin.
What he was not prepared for was the solitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``The silence was the loudest sound I had ever heard,'' Katz
says. ``The second night I was there, I drove to a liquor store and
got a big bottle of Glenlivet and drank most of it. I didn't drink
after that. I came to treasure being alone. I loved it so much it
scared me.''
</P>
<P>
   When he came down off the mountain, he had had no epiphanies,
experienced no revelations, but he was a changed man. For one
thing, his publisher had canceled his mystery series and he felt as
if a great burden had been lifted. And he'd learned that
spirituality was possible outside of organized religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being around beautiful, quiet things is spiritual. Growth
doesn't have to come from religion; it can come from the kind of
father and the kind of husband you are.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Wordplay: Every time a revised edition of a dictionary
appears, a big deal is made about all the new words that have been
created. Words such as cybersurf and nerd and e-mail. But what
about all the words that drop off the map? Well, you can read all
about them in Jeffrey Kacirk's ``Forgotten English'' (Quill, $11
paperback), a bizarre and entertaining guide to archaic words.
Among the gems Kacirk has uncovered are ``isabelline,'' an
adjective indicating a grayish-yellow or parchment color, named for
a princess who vowed not to change her underwear until her unlucky
father won a certain battle; ``piggesnye,'' a term of endearment
for one's sweetheart; or ``amober,'' a medieval Welsh legal term
for a ``maiden fee,'' a payment imposed by the lord of the manor as
compensation for forgoing his right to sleep with a servant girl on
her wedding night. Kacirk's stories behind the words offer a
fascinating glimpse into history.
</P>
<P>
   _ Story search: Paul Cossman at Humpus Bumpus Books in Cumming
is looking for a few good writers for his ``O, Georgia!'' and ``O,
Georgia, Too!'' anthologies. Cossman, who had to cancel the ``O,
Georgia!'' competition last year because of lack of participation,
says the anthologies are a good opportunity for Georgia writers to
showcase their work. Plus, he says, there are cash prizes of $250
for the best adult writer and $100 and $50 prizes for the top three
student writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``O, Georgia!'' is open to adults, ``O, Georgia, Too!'' to
students from kindergarten through grade 12. For entry forms and
information, call 770-781-9705 or send e-mail to
paulcossman(at)mindspring.com. The deadline is March 15.

 &HT;    `Duane's Depressed' familiar new offering by McMurtry
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry McMurtry apparently has run out of country song titles for
his novels. There were ``All My Friends are Gonna Be Strangers''
and ``Moving On,'' the old Hank Snow hit, and ``Leaving Cheyenne''
and ``Somebody's Darling'' and ``Streets of Laredo.'' They didn't
come in sequence, but they were in there along with other titles
such as ``The Last Picture Show'' and ``Terms of Endearment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Archer City, Texas, native has turned out a passel of good,
not-so-good, and very, very good novels including the one that
pushed him over the line, apparently, into a national superstar and
Pulitzer winner, ``Lonesome Dove.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't think ``Lonesome Dove'' was his best, but I did like it
very much. My favorites at this moment anyway are, ``Moving On''
and ``Leaving Cheyenne.'' From remarks attributed to him over the
years, I have the impression McMurtry never has particularly liked
``Leaving Cheyenne,'' for reasons I could never fathom. Maybe
because so many of his fans loved it so much back in his early
years and he didn't want to be tied to an early bird like that. I
have great respect for McMurtry as a writer. I like him fine as a
person, too, despite the popular notion that he is hard to talk to
and generally unfriendly at times.
</P>
<P>
   I've been around McMurtry from time to time over the years and
never found him to be off-putting in any way. I have heard stories
from others, however, and figure that's his business. If he wants
to occasionally be unapproachable, he has as much right to that as
those who approach him have a right to do so. Maybe more.
</P>
<P>
   Actors and singers and even professional athletes may be obliged
to interact with their fans, since their fans pay money _
increasing amounts of money _ to watch them do what they do. But
writers must do their work in private, alone, so it seems different
to me. But I digress....
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry's new novel is titled ``Duane's Depressed.'' The Duane
in question is, of course, the one we first met in ``The Last
Picture Show'' as a teen-ager and later as a husband and father
approaching middle age in ``Texasville.''
</P>
<P>
   Duane's gotten relatively rich in the ``awl bidness'' and is
now, in this latest, in his early 60s and wondering whether his
life has been meaningful or not.
</P>
<P>
   The opening chapter is hilarious, especially if you grew up in
Small Town, Texas, where nobody walked anywhere. Duane suddenly
decides to park his pickup and walk everywhere he needs to go. This
not only upsets his wife, Karla, it stirs up a controversy all over
the town of Thalia. Friends and neighbors wonder if Duane has come
down with Alzheimers or completely lost his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Karla's first thought is that Duane has decided to divorce her.
She is even more upset when Duane decides to walk the six miles to
his cabin and live there indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   All the ``Last Picture Show'' characters are accounted for in
this story, that comes closer to having the familiar McMurtry tone
and flavor than some of his other books have in recent years. If
you liked ``The Last Picture Show'' and ``All My Friends are Gonna
Be Strangers,'' you'll probably like this one.
</P>
<P>
   We discover what happened to Jacy, the town's prettiest girl who
caused Duane and others so much angst in their teens. Duane's
problems now usually involve his children and grandchildren, all
except those who are serving time in jail seem to live with, or
very near, him and Karla and depend on Duane for their basic needs.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite character in ``Duane's Depressed'' may be Shorty,
Duane's dog, who is loyal to a fault as dog's so often are.
</P>
<P>
   Now and then you hear that McMurtry has decided to quit writing
books. ``Duane's Depressed'' makes me hope that's just another
baseless rumor.

 &HT;    `Star Wars: Phantom Menace' mania likely to produce staggering
May box office debut
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The phenomenon began a long time ago in a cineplex not
so far away. Now it's coming back _ in 83 days, to be precise. And
leading up to its May 21 release, George Lucas' fourth ``Star
Wars'' film will be one hyped-up ``Menace'' to society.
</P>
<P>
   Next month will bring a new 2.5-minute trailer for ``Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' purported to have more than 100
fresh sequences from the film, featuring battle droids, laser
firepower and an eye-popping canyon race.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Pepsi USA will launch an ad campaign for soft drink
collectibles that will likely include a gold Pepsi can sporting
Jedi instructor Yoda and the ``Star Wars: Episode I'' logo.
</P>
<P>
   And starting April 30, Denver will host the Lucasfilm
Ltd.-sanctioned ``Star Wars Celebration,'' a three-day fan festival
at the Wings Over the Rockies Museum with ``Phantom Menace'' sneak
peeks, appearances by many of the film's stars, including young
Jake Lloyd who plays Anakin Skywalker (a.k.a. Darth Vader), and a
marketplace hawking merchandise from all the ``Star Wars'' films.
</P>
<P>
   When the movie finally debuts in May, some think its box office
take will be staggering, likely topping ``The Lost World: Jurassic
Park's'' record $92.73 million opener in 1997. For ``Phantom
Menace,'' Hollywood is planning on stepping out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a clear path completely around that movie for
weeks,'' says Ira Mayer, publisher of Entertainment Marketing
Letter in New York. ``Nobody's putting anything major out against
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers haven't seen hype this big since, well, last summer
and ``Godzilla.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hype can kill you, as `Godzilla' found out,'' says Dan Cox,
film editor at the trade magazine Variety. ``I expect (`Phantom
Menace') will make an enormous amount of money, but I don't know
how it will hold up. George Lucas is a little out of touch,
frankly. But he can tell a story well. I just wonder if the
technology is going to be up to what people are expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, people are expecting a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Last November ``you had moviegoers paying $7.50 not to see a
movie but to see the first trailer (when it was paired with films
like `The Waterboy' and `Meet Joe Black'),'' says CNN's Jim Moret,
anchor of ``Showbiz Today.'' ``If that isn't pre-opening buzz, I
don't know what is.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those fans was Kristopher Graham, 24, of Dawsonville, who
drove to Alpharetta's North Point theaters just to see the trailer.
He dubbed it ``awesome. It sends chills down you.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole ``Star Wars'' thing ``has come to occupy our culture
in a unique way,'' says Matthew Bernstein, associate professor of
the film studies program at Emory University. ``They talk about a
film everybody has seen like `The Wizard of Oz'. It's occurred to
me I'm no longer sure every child in America growing up sees 'The
Wizard of Oz.' But you know every one of them sees 'Star Wars.'''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just in America.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Moritz Minzlaff, an 18-year-old German college student
in Karlsruhe, south of Heidelberg, posted an Internet message
begging fellow foreign ``Star Wars'' fans to join him in traveling
to the United States to see ``Phantom Menace'' in May (opening
dates outside North America start in June).
</P>
<P>
   So far Minzlaff has gotten responses from dozens of fans in
Germany, France, Slovakia, Great Britain, Sweden, Austria and
Switzerland. He plans to travel to Los Angeles with the group he
assembles for the first showing of ``Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done anything like this (before),'' Minzlaff says in
an interview via e-mail. ``I think it's a crazy thing to do but
that's part of the fun. `Star Wars' is something special to me.
I've never been this excited about anything. I started counting
down the days when the release was more than 500 days away.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar sentiments clog the Internet, which has been littered
with ``Star Wars'' sites for years. Activity has intensified in
recent weeks with unofficial postings of purported sound clips
pirated from the film's production, an alleged frame-by-frame
accounting of what moviegoers will see in the coming new trailer
and spy reports from London's Abbey Road where John Williams
recently began recording the ``Phantom Menace'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the information is housed in sites commonly referred to
among the webnoscenti as ``spoilers'' for the obvious reason that
they readily reveal anything they can get their hands on.
</P>
<P>
   The minutiae is often mind-boggling. Ryan Johnson's
www.astheygo.com, for instance, details one script excerpt he's
``99 percent sure that this might be authentic!''
</P>
<P>
   Here it is:
</P>
<P>
   Jedi: ``Holy Moley! What's that?''
</P>
<P>
   Anakin: ``I've got a bad feeling about this ...''
</P>
<P>
   Jedi: ``You always say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet users such as Germany's Minzlaff avoid many of the
spoiler sites. ``I'm very much concerned about knowing too much
about the story,'' he says. But he does hook into sites like
www.countingdown.com at least three times a day for ``Phantom
Menace'' updates.
</P>
<P>
   Countingdown.com is an obsessive-compulsive nirvanaland. The
entrance to the ``Star Wars'' pages contains a digital clock
counting down the days, hours, minutes and seconds until ``Phantom
Menace'' opens in theaters. (You, of course, can capture the clock
to place on your own computer desktop).
</P>
<P>
   Inside are news bits gleaned from media around the globe,
posters from the film and spy reports, including the latest gossip
on the burgeoning line of upcoming toys. One item, for instance,
estimates exactly how many new Lego ``Star Wars'' Mindstorm Droid
Developer Kits (each selling for $100) will be available at every
Toys R Us this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's ``Phantom Menace'' mania, however, isn't as
shocking to some as the mainstream media's handling of both of the
film and marketing in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's talking about the hype,'' Entertainment Marketing
Letter's Mayer says. ``The sense in the press is that (the film) is
the second coming. The truth is there is no next Beatles, there's
no next Elvis. There is just what there is.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, he says, ``the media is pushing how marketing is
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The press has definitely picked up on the ``Phantom Menace''
buzz. Many newspapers, including The Atlanta Journal-Constitution,
covered the debut of the first trailer. USA Today has announced it
will publish a package of ``Phantom Menace'' stories today. The San
Jose Mercury News began a weekly column on the coming film last
Sunday. And magazines like Vanity Fair have run extensive
interviews. Movieline even featured twentysomething movie and TV
stars talking about their favorite ``Star Wars'' characters.
(``Felicity's'' Keri Russell, for example, admits she wore her hair
in big, tight Princess Leia ear buns for two years after seeing the
original film, which debuted in 1977).
</P>
<P>
   To CNN's Moret, it's all pretty much justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at our function as being a marketer of the
film,'' he says. ``But if it's being embraced enough by moviegoers
to obsess over seeing a trailer, if people are going to camp out to
get the first tickets, that's a story.''
</P>
<P>
   With this film, there's a ``clear indication for quality and
blockbuster,'' Moret says. ``You don't often have both.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he adds, all the hype and all the marketing and all the
press and all the Web sites will only be too much ``when the fans
say it is too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it too much?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not for Keir Larock, 17, a student at the Maine School
of Science and Mathematics in Limestone, Ma. In a phone interview,
he says he's seen the first three ``Star Wars'' films ``200 times
each easily,'' has downloaded from the Internet at least seven
copies of the first ``Phantom Menace'' trailer and is organizing
via the Web his own group of fans to see the film on opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally mystified'' while watching that trailer for the
first time, he says. ``I saw my reason to live for the next six
months.''

 &HT;    Turner was the inspiration for `Rushmore' millionaire
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you've seen the movie ``Rushmore,'' you might think
Bill Murray _ who plays a millionaire steel tycoon _ reminds you of
somebody. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of modeled his look on Ted Turner,'' says Wes
Anderson, co-writer and director of the critically acclaimed prep
school comedy, now playing. ``I had these photographs of Ted Turner
that I took to the makeup woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Funnily enough, he's speaking only two blocks from CNN Center,
sitting on a couch in the back of a bright yellow tour bus. You
know, the rock 'n' roll kind of bus, complete with claustrophobic
sleeping berths and a seasoned driver accustomed to bad behavior
and long hours.
</P>
<P>
   So is this bus fulfilling some sort of rock star fantasy for the
young director?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's not,'' Anderson says with a sigh, a shake of the
head, then a yawn. ``Someone at Disney came up with the idea. We
arrived in Atlanta about midnight last night. I got four hours'
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's got resilience. He's only 29, though his gangly, pale,
spiky-haired looks could make you think he's younger.
</P>
<P>
   Receiving raves, ``Rushmore'' earned several critics' awards for
Murray, as well as a Golden Globe nomination for best supporting
actor. He plays a middle-aged man who runs afoul of 15-year-old
preppieMax Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) when both guys fall for the
same woman.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson co-wrote the script with actor Owen Wilson
(``Armageddon''). They met during college in Austin, Texas; made a
short movie called ``Bottle Rocket'' about a band of hapless,
would-be thieves; and enlisted the aid of producer-director James
L. Brooks (``As Good as It Gets'') in turning it into a feature
film. The '96 comedy earned good reviews, but didn't do much
business.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and Wilson (who's now acting opposite Liam Neeson and
Lili Taylor in DreamWorks' summer ghost flick ``The Haunting of
Hill House'') decided to write ``Rushmore'' because they both went
to prep schools. Wilson's was in Dallas, Anderson's in Houston; in
fact, the director's old alma mater stood in for the fictional
academy.
</P>
<P>
   The movie doesn't take place in Texas, per se, but in a
fablelike atmosphere. ``In the real world, this kid would never be
able to do what he does,'' Anderson says. ``So it was important to
have a world with its own logic, different from reality. We did
things with the design that makes it unreal. The walls are colors
you'd never get away with.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson visited his old school several times to ``do the
politics'' of getting permission to shoot there. ``It was fun,
because one of my classmates is teaching there now,'' he says. ``He
introduced me to a lot of people he thought I'd like to cast. Like
the `Serpico' play is all cast from the school and a lot of the
supporting, bit players.''
</P>
<P>
   Harder to come by was his Max. He auditioned around 1,800 teens
for the lead role. ``A lot of them were on tape. But I saw hundreds
and hundreds in person. I spent a year. We wanted somebody you'd
never seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzman fit the bill, though he wasn't without Hollywood
connections. He's the son of actress Talia Shire, nephew of Francis
Ford Coppola.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and Wilson share a house in Los Angeles with Owen's
brother, actor Luke Wilson (``Home Fries''). They're already
writing their next movie, about a New York family of geniuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they're really geniuses,'' he qualifies, ``but
they each have some kind of inspired area. It'll be a big cast, and
hopefully we'll try to shoot it sometime at the end of the year.
But we have to do a lot of work first.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no script yet. But Anderson has a couple of small,
spiral-bound notebooks, laid on the table in front of him. They're
crammed with precise notes in capital letters, and tiny sketches.
``You can flip,'' he says, handing a notebook to a reporter.
``Don't read.''

   TRAVEL-SKI-CANADA _ BANFF, ALBERTA _ Skiing, etc. at Banff/Lake
Louise: You should be as lucky as me right now: I am stamping my
Australian lamb-lined soft-leather Uggs on a glittering frozen pond
in the middle of western Canada. My right hand is wrapped around a
steaming, very strong Irish coffee. My left hand is deep inside the
pocket of a fleece ski parka. It's cold: minus-something Celsius,
but I'm dressed for it. And the sky is the clearest, darkest black
you've ever seen, and the Big Dipper is turned upside down and
spilling stars all over the place, while the man in the full
Canadian moon is grinning a big, goofy, McKenzie brothers smile.
That bright grin lights up everything: three soaring peaks of
Canadian Rockies that run along the frozen river behind me; the
castle-like Banff Springs Hotel that rises on the steep hill to my
right; the snow-bloated pines that scent the air
everywhere.(Jubera, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS.

looking for a lost tribe that, you hope, isn't associated with the
Shining Path. But lately, the word adventure has become a marketing
term to make tame tours sound more thrilling. Do you really think
15 people packed on an enormous raft, an inflated version of a tour
bus, drifting down a river is an adventure? A group hike on a
national park trail as crowded as a city sidewalk is thrilling?

   TRAVEL-SKI-CANADA _ BANFF, ALBERTA _ Skiing, etc. at Banff/Lake
Louise: You should be as lucky as me right now: I am stamping my
Australian lamb-lined soft-leather Uggs on a glittering frozen pond
in the middle of western Canada. My right hand is wrapped around a
steaming, very strong Irish coffee. My left hand is deep inside the
pocket of a fleece ski parka. It's cold: minus-something Celsius,
but I'm dressed for it. And the sky is the clearest, darkest black
you've ever seen, and the Big Dipper is turned upside down and
spilling stars all over the place, while the man in the full
Canadian moon is grinning a big, goofy, McKenzie brothers smile.
That bright grin lights up everything: three soaring peaks of
Canadian Rockies that run along the frozen river behind me; the
castle-like Banff Springs Hotel that rises on the steep hill to my
right; the snow-bloated pines that scent the air
everywhere.(Jubera, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS.

   ADVENTURES-COMMENTARY _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Adventure travel
used to mean something along the lines of riding a camel through
dust storms in Morocco, hot on the trail of the mysterious Blue
People. Or hacking your way with a machete through Peru's jungles,
looking for a lost tribe that, you hope, isn't associated with the
Shining Path. But lately, the word adventure has become a marketing
term to make tame tours sound more thrilling. Do you really think
15 people packed on an enormous raft, an inflated version of a tour
bus, drifting down a river is an adventure? A group hike on a
national park trail as crowded as a city sidewalk is thrilling?
(Blackerby, Palm Beach Post). 22.

Lauder, women can take their pick of anti-aging, wrinkle free
creams. (Hill, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS.

   COXNET-ENTERTAINMENT 0226 _ The phenomenon began a long time ago
in a cineplex not so far away. Now it's coming back _ in 83 days,

fourth ``Star Wars'' film will be one hyped-up ``Menace'' to

   SOUTH CHANNEL -- Turner South, Turner Broadcasting's 18th cable
TV channel, is scheduled to debut sometime this fall with a focus
on the South. (Haddad, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO REVIEWS -- Think of ``Ronin'' as a postmodern action
movie. This guilty pleasure from director John Frankenheimer casts
Robert De Niro as a member of an ad hoc band of secret warriors,
along with Jean Reno, Stellan Skarsgard and Sean Bean. (Staff,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   CD REVIEWS _ Once upon a time, Blondie was arguably the coolest
band in the world. Fronted by Deborah Harry, the perfect new wave
pinup girl, this New York combo churned out a string of
chart-topping hits. ``No Exit,'' Blondie's first album in 17 years,
shows how much times have changed. (Staff, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

   CONDUCTOR-DEPREIST _ A visit with conductor James DePreist, 62,
who leads the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra this weekend. The
62-year-old has studied with the best, and survived polio. He grew
up in South Philly, the birthplace of musicians from Mario Lanza to
Frankie Avalon. The great contralto Marian Anderson was his aunt.
Though a well-regarded possibility to succeed Yoel Levi, whose
contract with ASO expires in 2000, DePreist denies any
``candidacy.'' He's been music director of the Oregon Symphony for
19 seasons. (Green, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 22. WITH PHOTOS.

   PHANTOM _ Next month, ``Star Wars'' prequel fans will get their
second big fix _ a new 2.5 minute trailer to ``The Phantom Menace''
with more than 100 fresh images from the film. And coming in late
April and early May is Lucasfilm Ltd.'s officially sanctioned
three-day ``Star Wars Celebration'' fanfest to be held at Denver's
Wings Over The Rockies Museum (it'll have sneak peeks at
``Phantom,'' visits by some of the film's stars, including young
Jake Lloyd (Anakin Skywalker), and of course lots and lots of
merchandise to sell). (BLongino, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

www.theforce.net which boasts a purported frame-by-frame rundown
(in words only, sorry) of the coming trailer. (BLongino, Atlanta

   SKUBE-ON-BOOKS _ Of all forms of fictions, the spy novel draws
most on sensory response. In ``Archangel,'' Robert Harris immerses

Depressed.'' The Duane in question is, of course, the one we first

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: The joys of travel in the comfort
of your home
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ I used to think I wanted to be a world
traveler. Be careful what you think you want to be.
</P>
<P>
   These past 10 years, toiling in the vineyards for Cox
Newspapers, I've been here, there and yonder. Of the three, I
prefer here.
</P>
<P>
   If you think otherwise, have at it. Even if you don't have the
price of a ticket to take you halfway around the world, you can
still experience the thrill, the romance and the excitement of
traveling to faraway places.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how:
</P>
<P>
   Pack a suitcase with everything you'll need for the next couple
of weeks _ clothes to wear, books to read, pills for what ails you.
But pack light. The reason they call it luggage is because you have
to lug it.
</P>
<P>
   Say goodbye to friends and family. You'll be on your own, a long
way from home and lonesome. Of course, this being a pretend
journey, you'll have to instruct them to treat you like a stranger
when they do happen to see you around town.
</P>
<P>
   Set your TV and radio on a Spanish station or, better yet, one
playing 24-hour rap music. Just so that it's incomprehensible,
that's the main thing. That's what travel is: going to places where
you don't know what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   As for the plane trip itself, it's easy to simulate. Decide
where you're heading. Europe is about eight hours away; Asia,
closer to 13. Just go to your downtown bus station. Spend that
amount of time sitting in a chair in the waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   You can get up to go to the bathroom, but otherwise keep your
seat. Eat your meals from a vending machine. Stare at a blank wall,
as if you're staring out the window of the plane. If there's a TV,
watch that instead. Inflight movies, don't you know. Personally, I
prefer a blank wall.
</P>
<P>
   By the time your behind is totally numb, you can figure you're
about halfway there.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know what it's like to go through customs, when
you leave the bus station, look for a cop and start staggering as
if you're drunk. You'll be treated accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget your luggage. You're going to be hauling it with
you wherever you go, loading it and unloading it in taxis, city
buses and subways.
</P>
<P>
   Don't even think about driving a car. You're in one of those
countries where the traffic is upside down and backwards on the
wrong side of the street. You wouldn't last until the radiator got
hot.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be sleeping at home, of course, this being make-believe.
But you can sample the comfort of a foreign hotel easily enough.
Try sleeping on the couch _ better yet, an old couch in the attic.
</P>
<P>
   As for the facilities, run a garden hose through the bathroom
window to the tub. That'll be your shower. Little or no hot water
when you're shaving, either. Otherwise ... well, let's just say
toilet paper will be similarly rationed.
</P>
<P>
   Meals? That's tricky. There's nothing like foreign food.
Leastwise, nothing that we consider edible.
</P>
<P>
   The thing to do is pick local dishes you hate the most. Then
flavor them with castor oil. You'll get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Lest we forget, all this time you'll be jet-lagged. Simply
follow the above instructions at a time when you're just back on
your feet after a bout with the flu. That oughta do it.

   When Diane Kelly describes her unusual field of study, her
listeners, especially the men, tend to squirm. That's because she
spends her days doing experiments on the penises of mammals from
rats to armadillos. She is, to her knowledge, the first and only
scientist to study the biomechanics of the male organ _ in other
words, the principles of engineering and physics that enable the
penis to do what it's supposed to do. Mary Roach, a contributing
editor of Discover magazine, reports.

   Forensic scientists use the presence of pollen in decades-old
remains to try to establish the season that a mass slaying in
Germany took place _ and thereby the probable culprits, the Nazis
or the Soviet secret police. Also, researchers test a revolutionary
new device to help totally paralyzed people communicate through
brain waves; and a fossil of a newly discovered species of
saber-toothed cat is unearthed.

   ``Penis, penis, penis, penis, penis.'' Diane Kelly is making the
point that she is used to saying the word. She says it in front of
large gatherings of academics. She has said it to a Tallahassee
police officer who caught her by the side of the road, removing one
from a dead armadillo. She says it to people at barbecues and
dinner parties who ask her what she does for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, a 30-year-old postdoctoral fellow at Cornell, is the
first _ and to her knowledge only _ scientist in the world to study
the biomechanics of the mammalian penis.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to speculate on the reasons no scientist has studied
the penis in the past: a) the majority of scientists are men, and
b) the research involves things like ``inflation and bending
experiments,'' wherein a rat penis is attached, by way of electric
clamps, needles and superglue, to a strain gauge and a force
transducer. (The organ is not, mercifully, attached to the rat.)
Kelly allows that ``men do squirm a lot'' at her talks.
</P>
<P>
   Her field _ biomechanics, the application of principles of
physics and engineering to living things _ is a very young science,
only 35 years old or so.
</P>
<P>
   With biomechanics' elders heading into retirement, a second
generation has taken the baton and carried it into less obvious
places: the biomechanics of hearing, of smelling, of circulation.
Kelly was one of the intrepid few to claim reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   She chose male reproductive organs over female not because of
any prurient interest, she says, but because they're so much
simpler: fewer parts, fewer functions. The same practical bent
determines the species she studies.
</P>
<P>
   Dead armadillos, her original organ donors, were easy to come by
in the part of Florida where she did her graduate work. When
armadillos are startled, they invariably jump into the air, putting
them at grille height and pretty much sealing their fate in the
face of oncoming trafffic.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the male Florida armadillo has the advantage of
being uncommonly well endowed. Its penis can be as long as
one-third its body length (a proportion that stretches to
two-thirds in some South American armadillos), which may have
something to do with the need to insinuate it under the female's
shell.
</P>
<P>
   Biomechanically speaking, the male reproductive organ has to do
two things. It has to get rigid, and it has to deliver sperm. Kelly
made her name in the rigidity arena, solving, as she puts it, ``the
mechanical problem of how to make something that's floppy stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer she found contradicted conventional biomechanical
wisdom. A penis is, in its materialist essence, a fleshy cylinder,
and as such it's far from unique in nature _ mechanically, it's
akin to an earthworm or a squid tentacle.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of relying on bones for support, these ``hydrostatic''
structures use pressurized liquid. Hydrostats are elegant
engineering solutions to a host of physical challenges, but they
necessitate a couple of safety mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   First, a structure that relics on internal pressure for
stiffness must have a means of restraining that pressure _ a tough
skin _ to make sure its innards stay innards.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if it's going to bend, it must bend without crimping.
</P>
<P>
   In case after case, the solution nature has provided for these
cylinders is to protect them on the outside with fibers of collagen
woven in crossed helices, like intertwined spirals of DNA. This
arrangement lets the cylinder resist the internal pressure yet bend
smoothly and spring back naturally to its original position, a
desirable state of affairs if you're, say, a worm on the move.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had assumed that penises must have the same
arrangement of fibers. Apparently, no one had argued that a penis
is not a worm. A worm, though, if it's going to get anywhere, needs
to be readily bendable. A penis, for reasons that do not need
explaining, must be rigid. It has one place it needs to go, and
wriggling is not how it gets there.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly discovered, while examining armadillo penises for her
dissertation, that the fibers in the mammalian penis are not in
fact helically wound. Instead they're laid out in layers: one
longitudinal, in which the fibers run parallel to the organ's long
axis, and one circumferential, in which the fibers run
perpendicular. Kelly called the arrangement an axial orthogonal
array.
</P>
<P>
   Having collagen fibers arranged this way discourages bending and
allows the erect penis to hold its shape. It's not squishable. The
circumferential fibers keep it from bulging out when the end is
pushed in, and the longitudinal fibers hold its length when it's
squeezed. In short, the fiber array makes the erect penis behave
like an erect penis and not like a water balloon.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment Kelly is occupied with other matters:
investigating the baculum, or penis bone. Among mammals, there are
species of rodents, pinnipeds, bats, and primates that have bacula,
and in no case does anyone know what they're for.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly is working on a specimen, the penis of a freshly deceased
rat, testing a hypothesis about how the baculum might work.
</P>
<P>
   She grips the tip of the bone with a copper electric clamp and
impales the other end on a hypodermic needle. Then she ties a piece
of string around the base of the penis and pulls it tight. She
presses in the syringe plunger and pumps the penis full of saline.
This is how you give an erection to an unattached penis. (It tends
to have the opposite effect on attached penises, human ones anyway,
which usually leave the room right about now.)
</P>
<P>
   Kelly checks the strain gauge wires, then steps back. She
presses the switch to engage the pulling mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   The machine commences a slow upward motion. The tiny penis
bends, the computer beeps and whirs. Kelly sighs. ``Hours of prep
for minutes of glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Her relief can be read like a billboard. The data are in. She
can get in her car and go see her family and not say penis again
until tomorrow.

   &UR; OF FLOWERS AND MURDER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While digging the foundation for a building in the German town
of Magdeburg in 1994, workers were startled to discover a mass
grave. Hitler was rumored to have been buried in the area, yet an
examination of the grave turned up the remains of neither Hitler
nor Eva Braun, as some had suspected it might, but the skeletons of
32 young men. All had died violently sometime between 1945 and
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new forensic method has apparently settled the issue. The
killers were most likely Soviet secret police.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had theorized that the grave in Magdeburg was
created by one of two notorious organizations. The Gestapo, while
capable of many horrors, would not normally have created a mass
grave in the center of a city. But they may have done so in the
spring of 1945, during the last few chaotic weeks of the Second
World War.
</P>
<P>
   After the German defeat, the Gestapo was succeeded by SMERSH, a
Soviet counterintelligence agency. SMERSH reportedly executed
Soviet soldiers who refused to help quash a revolt in the former
German Democratic Republic in June 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic scientists have often used pollen found on victims to
determine where a murder took place, but Reinhard Szibor, a
biologist and forensic specialist at Otto von Guericke University
in Magdeburg, realized that pollen could also be used to determine
when death occurred, a crucial point in the case of the Magdeburg
mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   Pollen, as allergy sufferers know, is released by different
plants at different times of the year, depending on when they
flower. ``So everyone who dies at a particular time will have that
pollen in his nose,'' Szibor explains.
</P>
<P>
   Szibor rinsed out the nasal cavities of 21 skulls from the
Magdeburg grave. Seven contained large amounts of pollen from
plantains, and smaller amounts from lime trees and rye, all of
which release their pollen in June and July.
</P>
<P>
   The victims apparently died in the summertime, supporting the
theory that they were Soviet soldiers killed in June by SMERSH.
Researchers are now looking for corroborative evidence in archives
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MIND OVER MATTER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strokes and accidents that damage the brain of spinal cord
sometimes leave people fully conscious but unable to speak or move.
Trapped in their own bodies, the people who suffer from what is
sometimes called locked-in syndrome are lucky if they can
communicate their needs with a blink or a raised eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   That may soon change. A team of neurologists has developed a
device that allows paralyzed people to communicate through a
computer without having to move a muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Kennedy, a neurologist in private practice near Atlanta,
has been working on the implant _ a millimeter-long electrode _ for
12 years. Implanted into the part of the brain that normally
controls the hands, the electrode, coated with growth factors that
spur brain tissue to grow into it, picks up electric signals sent
back and forth by nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   When a patient thinks about moving his hands, electrical
activity near the electrode increases. Through an amplifier and
antennas positioned underneath the scalp, those signals are
transmitted to a computer, which uses them to drive a cursor across
a screen.
</P>
<P>
   By concentrating or relaxing, a patient can control the firing
of his neurons and make the cursor stop on an icon with a prepared

   &UR; A NEW SABER-TOOTHED CAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In north central Florida there is a sinkhole that local fossil
collectors call Hog Heaven. Paleontologists have unearthed the
remains of dozens of large wild hogs called peccaries from the
site, as well as the skeletons of two saber-toothed cats, all of
which died about 1 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the sabertoothed cats were bringing home pork
for the kittens,'' says paleontologist Larry Martin of the
University of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The cats from Hog Heaven are unique for more than their penchant
for pork _ they are the first specimens of a new and particularly
fearsome species of sabertooth, bringing the total number of known
North American species to three.
</P>
<P>
   The new cat, which has not been officially named, combines some
of the deadliest features of the other two species. Like Smilodon
(the picture-book example of a sabertooth), it had a powerful,
stocky build.
</P>
<P>
   ``And like Homotherium, it had broad, knifelike teeth that are
very coarsely crenulated, and then a projecting set of long, curved
incisors that are serrated like a steak knife,'' says Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the largest, most ferocious sabertooth in the world at
that time,'' says Martin. ``If I were going to choose who would win
a bout of mortal combat,'' he adds, ``I'm not sure that this thing
wouldn't clean Smilodon's _ or Homotherium's _ plow.''

   &UR; OF FLOWERS AND MURDER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While digging the foundation for a building in the German town
of Magdeburg in 1994, workers were startled to discover a mass
grave. Hitler was rumored to have been buried in the area, yet an
examination of the grave turned up the remains of neither Hitler
nor Eva Braun, as some had suspected it might, but the skeletons of
32 young men. All had died violently sometime between 1945 and
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new forensic method has apparently settled the issue. The
killers were most likely Soviet secret police.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had theorized that the grave in Magdeburg was
created by one of two notorious organizations. The Gestapo, while
capable of many horrors, would not normally have created a mass
grave in the center of a city. But they may have done so in the
spring of 1945, during the last few chaotic weeks of the Second
World War.
</P>
<P>
   After the German defeat, the Gestapo was succeeded by SMERSH, a
Soviet counterintelligence agency. SMERSH reportedly executed
Soviet soldiers who refused to help quash a revolt in the former
German Democratic Republic in June 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic scientists have often used pollen found on victims to
determine where a murder took place, but Reinhard Szibor, a
biologist and forensic specialist at Otto von Guericke University
in Magdeburg, realized that pollen could also be used to determine
when death occurred, a crucial point in the case of the Magdeburg
mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   Pollen, as allergy sufferers know, is released by different
plants at different times of the year, depending on when they
flower. ``So everyone who dies at a particular time will have that
pollen in his nose,'' Szibor explains.
</P>
<P>
   Szibor rinsed out the nasal cavities of 21 skulls from the
Magdeburg grave. Seven contained large amounts of pollen from
plantains, and smaller amounts from lime trees and rye, all of
which release their pollen in June and July.
</P>
<P>
   The victims apparently died in the summertime, supporting the
theory that they were Soviet soldiers killed in June by SMERSH.
Researchers are now looking for corroborative evidence in archives
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MIND OVER MATTER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strokes and accidents that damage the brain of spinal cord
sometimes leave people fully conscious but unable to speak or move.
Trapped in their own bodies, the people who suffer from what is
sometimes called locked-in syndrome are lucky if they can
communicate their needs with a blink or a raised eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   That may soon change. A team of neurologists has developed a
device that allows paralyzed people to communicate through a
computer without having to move a muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Kennedy, a neurologist in private practice near Atlanta,
has been working on the implant _ a millimeter-long electrode _ for
12 years. Implanted into the part of the brain that normally
controls the hands, the electrode, coated with growth factors that
spur brain tissue to grow into it, picks up electric signals sent
back and forth by nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   When a patient thinks about moving his hands, electrical
activity near the electrode increases. Through an amplifier and
antennas positioned underneath the scalp, those signals are
transmitted to a computer, which uses them to drive a cursor across
a screen.
</P>
<P>
   By concentrating or relaxing, a patient can control the firing
of his neurons and make the cursor stop on an icon with a prepared
message or on a letter of a keyboard display. The computer then
speaks or prints a letter or message.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Roy Bakay, a neurosurgeon at Emory University, have
tried the implant on a man paralyzed from the top of the neck down
after a stroke. He hasn't quite mastered the keyboard, but he can
position the icon near prepared messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's delighted,'' says Kennedy, ``and when it works for him he
has a big smile on his face.''

ARIZONA SCHOOL GAY CLUB ALLOWED TO STAY 
</HEADLINE>
 CLUB-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY PEARCE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GILBERT, Ariz. - It's a typical high school club: socializing on
campus, volunteering with other school organizations, holding
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Only its status is unique.
</P>
<P>
   Gays, Lesbians and Straight Supporters, or GLASS, is believed to
be the only club in Phoenix area schools for gay or lesbian
students and their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, GLASS was not just a club with an untraditional
standing at Gilbert High School, but also one at risk of having no
standing at all.
</P>
<P>
   Since GLASS formed in January, the student council tried
unsuccessfully to ban the club, an Arizona lawmaker introduced a
bill that would have effectively done the same, and school and
district administrators looked into whether the club had a legal
right to be on campus.
</P>
<P>
   One state representative wrote the founder of GLASS, saying his
sexual orientation amounted to ``a death style, not a lifestyle'''
and she hoped his club would not be allowed to exist.
</P>
<P>
   None of which have fazed Jesse Evans, a 17-year-old senior who
formed GLASS. Openly gay, Evans said he's had people spit on him,
hurl gay-bashing epithets and throw trash at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gilbert is the last place you would expect this club,'' Evans
said, calling it a religious and socially conservative enclave.
``Being openly gay at Gilbert High is hard.''
</P>
<P>
   He and 20 other students formed the club to give gay and lesbian
students a haven where they don't feel different, where they aren't
misunderstood, and where they find support to navigate through
life. About half of the members are gay or lesbian; the others are
straight students who believe in supporting their classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who are gay have not even told their parents of
their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's paramount to the youth to have a positive support
environment, whether it be in the home or school,'' said Lyle
Miller, executive director of Valley of the Sun Gay and Lesbian
Community Center. Miller said that gay youths are several times
more likely to attempt suicide and to drop out of school because of
derision and attacks from their peers.
</P>
<P>
   School clubs for gays and lesbians are rare locally. One emerged
last school year at Corona del Sol High School in Tempe, but it
dissolved when some of the members graduated last spring. A gay and
lesbian support group took its place, and other support groups have
cropped up at several other schools, including Chandler and Central
high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Several parents have told GLASS members that they don't believe
high school is the proper place for such a group and that the
students should seek counseling.
</P>
<P>
   The student council initially sought a change in the bylaws that
would have prevented clubs that don't have an academic bent,
students said. The council eventually decided against the move.
</P>
<P>
   And when Evans wrote her an e-mail about GLASS, Rep. Karen
Johnson, R-Mesa, fired one back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him that in my opinion that the particular
lifestyle that he has chosen, which he has every right to choose,
is something that I don't think is especially good for young people
that are still in their formative years, and that, in fact, I
looked at it as a death style not a lifestyle,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rep. Linda Gray, R-Glendale, introduced a bill
prohibiting school clubs that encourage criminal or delinquent
conduct, promote a specific sexual orientation or conduct that
contradicts abstinence. She since has decided to hold off on the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Such attempts have occurred elsewhere. Three years ago in Utah,
lawmakers passed a bill banning clubs that encourage criminal or
delinquent conduct, bigotry or sexual behavior, after the
Gay-Straight Alliance was formed at a Salt Lake City high school.
Eventually, the school board banished all non-academic clubs at all
of the city's high schools.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gilbert district officials downplayed concerns
about GLASS. They said they sought legal advice and held a couple
of meetings with Evans and his friends, but have concluded that the
club can continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the legal right to be there,'' Assistant
Superintendent Dave Allison said. ``We don't want it to be a
political action group. That would be true of any club.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Morrison, Gilbert School Board president, admitted there
is room for misunderstanding when folks hear about the club. But
every club will be given the same privileges as long as they abide
by the rules, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Gray still has problems with Gilbert High's GLASS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not like when kids are singled out and made fun of,'' she
said. But ``where does it (the club) meet academic standards?''
</P>
<P>
   Gray also took offense to club members trying to recruit
students during class time and telling each other they didn't have
to share with their parents that they were attending GLASS
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Evans said students and teachers have told him they respect
and admire his determination in forming the club. The straight
members of the club tell Evans they joined because they want to
support their gay friends and family members.
</P>
<P>
   Even the student council, which some said was against GLASS in
the beginning, is trying to find a happy medium.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Evans said, he knows the future of GLASS is never a
given.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how life is going to be. It is a lot to handle,'' he
said. &QL;

DR. BENTON FINALLY GETS RESPECT ON `ER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Eriq LaSalle knew his time would come. Anthony
Edwards has had his episodes, same for Julianna Margulies. Of
course, we all know about George Clooney, whose departure from
``ER'' on the Feb. 18 episode is a milestone in the top-rated show.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Peter Benton never got his shot in the spotlight as the
sole focus of this ensemble hit.
</P>
<P>
   Why so long? ``I've been asking that for five years,'' LaSalle
said in a telephone interview last week. ``All the principals have
had not just one opportunity, but multiple opportunities. Finally,
this year Warner Brothers (the production studio) stepped in and
here we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Benton stepped into the forefront in ``Middle of
Nowhere,'' the title of the episode where the young super surgeon
traveled to Mississippi on a special assignment he took for
much-needed cash. In the end he earned a lot more than money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The episode itself, as I see it, is a metaphor about a man
going on a geographic journey, but more importantly ... an
emotional journey,'' LaSalle said. ``It allows him to get in touch
with himself with what is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helps him to start diminishing his God complex. He
starts realizing he can't control everything. He can't control
people.''
</P>
<P>
   LaSalle said the most surprising thing about Benton's evolution
has been the audience's reaction. Originally, the acerbic doctor
was the character people loved to hate. After the third season he
became the character you hated to love. But through this process
viewers never became turned off to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more fun playing a three-dimensional character,'' LaSalle
said. ``You never know what you are going to get. He still has ego.
He can be cold and indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is human,'' LaSalle said. ``Sometimes you are going
to like him, sometimes you are not.''
</P>
<P>
   LaSalle said part of the appeal of Benton is that he can't be
pigeon-holed into the role of sinner or saint, hero or villain.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times it is reverse racism, the `Noble Savage'
syndrome: we are either beasts or perfect,'' LaSalle said. ``No
race or people completely fits either one of those definitions.
This guy is flawed, but ultimately he has a good heart. But there
are times those flaws will overwhelm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I obviously would like to see certain parts of Benton explored
more,'' LaSalle said. ``There are so many layers to this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Clooney, LaSalle said his worth to the show went far
beyond what viewers saw on Thursday nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``George has been the center of the ensemble,'' LaSalle said.
``He is the big brother who took care of everybody. He helped keep
us a tight unit and I think that translates on film. He was the
peacekeeper, he was the clown, he was the adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   LaSalle was circumspect in discussing his own potential
departure from the show. ``My contract expires next year,'' LaSalle
said. ``I am on the show until my contract expires.''
</P>
<P>
   And after that? ``My contract expires next year,'' LaSalle
repeated. ``I am on the show until my contract expires.''

FANS KEEP OLD TV HEROES ALIVE ON THE INTERNET

<P>
   Eddie Mekka is still alive, and thank heavens for that.
</P>
<P>
   The poor dancing fool better known as Carmine Ragussa from
``Laverne and Shirley'' was rumored on the Internet to have been
polished off by some overzealous moose in North Dakota during a
hunting expedition several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Unsubstantiated death accounts of long-forgotten entertainment
personalities are nothing new on the Web. Fortunately for Mekka,
fans determined to keep their idol's names alive have built sites
that have become staples of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Liz Clare's Internet tribute to Herman Wedemeyer.
Herman who? He's the chap who played Duke Lukela on ``Hawaii
Five-O.''
</P>
<P>
   From pictures of his football glory days, to his stint as a
state legislator in Hawaii, the site is Wedemeyer all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ``Hawaii Five-O'' sites are about Jack Lord, said
Clare, of Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know anything about (Wedemeyer), and since I started
the site last June, I've learned so much about him,'' Clare said.
``I haven't heard from him, but I hear he's alive and well and
playing golf everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to another site, the name George Stanford Brown of the
1972-'76 police series ``The Rookies'' will no longer be a Trivial
Pursuit answer. A devoted fan of the star has ensured Brown's
perpetual presence on the Web. Like most typical fan pages, Brown's
includes a complete filmography, biography and photo gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is not totally relegated to television history. He
recently played a bit role on ``The X-Files.''

ANY WAY YOU SLICE IT, THE TOMATO IS PACKED WITH NUTRITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN GRIFFIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no escaping the tomato. And who would want to?
</P>
<P>
   Tomatoes are used in everything from soup to salad. Texans, for
example, have long recognized the value of this fruit of the vine
(it's a vegetable only in the legal sense; the Supreme Court
declared it so in 1893 for trade purposes) and have used it
liberally in such regional staples as salsa, Spanish rice and pico
de gallo.
</P>
<P>
   It's also one of the few foods moms don't have to use a hard
sell to get their children to eat. A tomato's great flavor makes it
as appealing as its levels of vitamins and potassium.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say that a tomato a day can reduce a person's risk of
developing prostate, colon, rectal and breast cancers, as well as
cut the risk of heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Tomatoes contain a substance called lycopene, which has strong
cancer-fighting properties. Lycopene is an antioxidant in the
carotenoid family, the same group as beta carotene, and it is what
gives tomatoes their rich red color.
</P>
<P>
   Processed tomatoes are better than raw, said Dr. Venket Rao, a
professor in the University of Toronto's Department of Nutritional
Sciences, who has conducted independent studies of lycopene.
</P>
<P>
   Heat will increase the lycopene level, he explained, adding that
the level found in tomato paste is 2 1/2 times that of a raw
tomato.
</P>
<P>
   Rao's research also suggests that the body processes lycopene
more efficiently when it's taken with a small amount of oil or fat.
So any way you prepare or eat tomatoes _ even ketchup on a few
fries _ can be good for you.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Weir, a fourth-generation chef, found it easy to fill her
cookbook, ``You Say Tomato: Peel, Chop, Roast, Dry, Freeze,
Preserve, and Enjoy'' (Broadway Books, $15).
</P>
<P>
   ``More than any other fruit or vegetable, the tomato has changed
the face of modern cuisine,'' Weir said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter where we live, we look forward to growing our own
tomatoes or to buying them fresh at the farmers' market,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Weir is not one to let any part of the tomato go to waste. If a
recipe calls for peeling, she will save the skin, bake it and grind
it into what she calls tomato dust. The dust is a great flavor
enhancer in vinaigrettes, sauces and soups. It's also rich in
lycopene, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other red foods, such as watermelon and pink grapefruit, also
contain this cancer preventive, but studies have focused on
tomatoes, Rao said, because ``85 to 90 percent of lycopene in our
diet comes from tomatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't be fooled into thinking lycopene-rich tomatoes are the
only weapon in fighting cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a nutritionist, I must say there are no magic bullets,''
the Toronto researcher said.

<P>
   DALLAS _ With 75 orders already in hand for their new 609
civilian tilt-rotor aircraft, Bell Helicopter Textron and its
Italian partner, Agusta, are feeling optimistic enough to nudge the
ante a bit higher.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 75 orders, which will be delivered through 2004,
buyers had to make an initial deposit of $100,000 toward the total
cost of about $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   But now the earnest money is rising to $150,000, Bell said this
week at the industry's annual Heli-Expo show in Dallas. And the
second round of buyers won't get their aircraft until at least
2005.
</P>
<P>
   The 609 is the civilian version of the V-22 Osprey, being built
for the U.S. Marines. The tilt-rotors are designed to hover like a
helicopter, or fly straight ahead at speeds up to 300 miles per
hour, double the speed of the fastest helicopters today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hope that in the first decade of production, we could
sell about 1,200 609s,'' said James K. Rogers, a longtime Bell
executive who is managing director of the Bell/Agusta joint
venture.
</P>
<P>
   Early buyers who have made deposits include local luminaries
such as Ross Perot Jr. and Donald Carter, as well as billionaire
Wayne Huizenga of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and golfer Greg Norman.
Perot and Norman are longtime Bell customers.
</P>
<P>
   Bell is concentrating on the executive market, as well as
offshore energy and rescue industries.
</P>
<P>
   Bell intends to assemble 609s at its new Amarillo plant and also
at the Agusta helicopter plant in Vergiate, Italy, north of Milan.
</P>
<P>
   The 609 will have a range of 750 miles, reach an altitude of
25,000 feet, and fly in all weather. Prototypes are scheduled to be
completed late next year. The first craft will probably not be
delivered to buyers until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The 609's current price of $10 million is $3 million to $5
million more than the cost of the twin-blade helicopters that the
609 will compete against. But the craft, which is powered by
turboprops, is considerably cheaper than corporate jets such as the
Gulfstream V, which can cost up to $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bell and Agusta announced their joint venture last year. The
venture will be based in Fort Worth but will have a separate
identity from Bell Helicopter Textron.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 Agusta engineers and marketing personnel have already
relocated from Italy to Bell's plant in far east Fort Worth.
Agusta's presence at Bell is headed by Antonio Giovannini, a
22-year veteran of the company who learned to fly helicopters in
the Italian Navy. Giovannini moved to Bedford this month.
</P>
<P>
   Giovannini professes to like Texas, even though he can't easily
indulge his passions for Italian soccer and skiing. But his highest
enthusiasm is reserved for the 609.
</P>
<P>
   ``This aircraft will revolutionize flight the way the helicopter
did in the early 1950s,'' Giovannini said.
</P>
<P>
   Agusta was a longtime fixed-wing aircraft builder until stripped
of that right after World War II. It switched to helicopters, and
Bell was the first American company to license its products with
Agusta in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really was the birth of the modern Agusta, and we have
had a good relationship with Bell ever since,'' Giovannini said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell has been betting heavily on tilt-rotors for the past two
decades. The fight to get the military to buy the Osprey was long
and torturous, including a cancellation by the Bush administration
in 1990. The Clinton Pentagon revived the Osprey, and the first
prototypes are going through land and sea trials now. Bell expects
to deliver the first full production V-22 to the Marines from
Amarillo this May.
</P>
<P>
   Military orders for the V-22 stand at 425 for the Marines, and
50 for the Air Force special forces.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Chairman Terry Stinson is optimistic that tilt-rotors will
also be sold to the Coast Guard for rescue work.
</P>
<P>
   The military is expected to play a major role in the shakeout of
tilt-rotor technology before the civilian market accepts it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of questions about the tilt-rotor,
particularly its cost of maintenance, and how it will handle
turbulence and other problems,'' said Mike Harvey, vice president
of a Bellport, N.Y., helicopter reconditioning company, who stopped
by the 609 mockup for a peek at the Heli-Expo.
</P>
<P>
   But Harvey said the military will answer a lot of those
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody doubts the gee-whiz aspect of the tilt-rotor. But there
are still questions about the tilt-rotor's application in
nonmilitary fields.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, will corporate executives accustomed to jet power
give it up for a turboprop?
</P>
<P>
   The company is counting on it, citing the advantage that the 609
can land atop a building or on a flat parking lot, eliminating
drives through heavy traffic to distant airports.
</P>
<P>
   The acute shortage of full-service helicopter ``vertiports'' in
major U.S. cities is often a topic of discussion at meetings like
Heli-Expo.
</P>
<P>
   But Rogers notes that the 609 is lighter than several other
civilian hover aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   It ``has been designed to land anywhere a conventional
helicopter can land,'' he said. ``That includes open fields.''

MEXICO TO IMPOSE FEE ON INLAND VISITORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID HENDRICKS  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Mexico plans to charge tourists a $15 entry fee
beginning July 1, a move some business people say could harm
tourism, particularly among travelers of modest means.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Espinosa Villarreal, the tourism minister of Mexico,
announced the new fee this week during a visit to Texas, where he
is campaigning for foreign investment in his nation's visitor
industry. The fee is expected to generate about $150 million
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Espinosa said the fee would be collected from airline passengers
as well as from tourists arriving by auto or bus.
</P>
<P>
   For airline passengers, the fee will be added to the price of
tickets, he said. Auto and bus passengers will pay the fee at the
interior checkpoints of Mexico, usually located about 15 miles from
the border. Tourists traveling no further than border cities will
not have to pay the fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will not complicate entry into Mexico,'' Espinosa said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, some 10 million people visited Mexico's interior _
including about 800,000 who arrived in autos and buses _ according
to the Mexican Government Tourism Office in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism representatives said the fee would not likely change the
plans of vacationers who fly into resort areas, but would hurt less
affluent people who go to Mexico to visit family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will definitely have an impact on tourism,'' said Max
Rosenstein, owner of the Sanborn's Mexican Insurance office in San
Antonio, which sells auto insurance for people driving into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not look on this favorably. Business is off already
because of bad publicity of incidents with tourists in Mexico. This
cannot help,'' said Floyd Woods, general manager of Travco Service
in McAllen, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists entering Mexico now receive a free visa good for six
months. Each time they leave and return to Mexico, they must get
another visa, even if an earlier one has not expired. After July 1,
each entry will require payment of the $15 fee, according to the
Mexican Government Tourism Office in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The fee will be in addition to the $18 per-passenger airport
departure tax, which is used to fund the nation's airport system.
</P>
<P>
   The revenues from the entry fee will go mainly to pump up
Mexico's budget to promote and advertise tourism, Espinosa said.
Other portions of the revenues will fund international networks of
consulate and tourism offices, the modernization of immigration
services plus tourist assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tourists to Mexico will be compensated,'' Espinosa said.
``This is a duty similar to that charged in many other countries
and it will, for the first time, allow us to plan our promotion
programs on a long-term basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Espinosa said his ministry had weighed the impact of the fee on
the country's growing visitor industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the basis of international experience, we expect the
negative impact of this duty on tourist flows to be minimal, and we
are confident that the positive impact on our ability to promote
Mexico internationally will far outweigh it ... This is competitive
with the rest of the world. Mexico is not a high-taxation
country.''

 &HT;    Luminous Lewis lifts uneven `Sister'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Juliette Lewis' off-kilter, eccentric acting style makes her
performance in ``The Other Sister'' seem inevitable. As a mentally
challenged woman determined to live life on her own terms, she
brings focus and electricity to a gooey-glossy film that sometimes
plays like a lavish Movie of the Week.
</P>
<P>
   Co-written and directed by Garry Marshall (``Pretty Woman''),
``Sister'' unfolds in a rarefied stratum of San Francisco, where
the Tate family awaits the arrival of Carla (Lewis). She's the
daughter of Elizabeth Tate (Diane Keaton), sent years ago to a
private boarding school for ``special'' students. It's a decision
Elizabeth still regrets. We know, because she tells her
long-suffering husband, Radley (Tom Skerritt), ``I'm gonna make it
up to that girl!''
</P>
<P>
   But mom can't distinguish loving from smothering. She frets when
Carla enrolls in the local poly tech, when Carla insists that she
wants her own apartment, and most of all when Carla falls for
another mentally challenged person, Danny (Giovanni Ribisi).
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds familiar, you might be remembering ``Like Normal
People,'' a 1979 TV movie that starred Linda Purl and Shaun Cassidy
as a similar young couple. ``The Other Sister'' does a big-bucks
variation on the theme, filling the screen with plush Bay Area
interiors and honey-gold cinematography from Dante Spinotti (``L.A.
Confidential'').
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of movie in which Radley blows off steam by
tinkering with his sailboat and Elizabeth says things like, ``You
remember the club, don't you, Carla dear?'' When mother and
daughter finally have their big emotional blowup, it happens on a
pristine golf course and the ladies are wearing formal gowns.
(Director Marshall makes sure we realize that this is a big, teary
moment by having the lawn sprinklers whirl on at the climax of
their argument.)
</P>
<P>
   These silver-spoon trappings are nice to look at, but they lower
the dramatic stakes. No matter what happens, you know that nobody's
in danger of losing much. The big issue is Carla's self-worth, not
where her next meal is coming from or how she would get by if all
she had to rely on was a welfare check. All the Tates love one
another, including Carla's smart, blond sisters. (One of these has
a lesbian lover whom Elizabeth refuses to meet, but the subplot
seems to be there for P.C. flavoring, because it sure doesn't add
any extra dramatic interest.)
</P>
<P>
   Keaton, that nimble comedian, seems uncomfortable playing a
fussy matron. Because Elizabeth is a control freak, we're
encouraged to dismiss her concerns out of hand. We never have to
face the reality that, whether Carla and Danny are in love or not,
Elizabeth has good reasons to be worried about their life together.
</P>
<P>
   That said, ``The Other Sister'' is still surprisingly watchable.
Mainly that's due to Lewis' emotional translucence. She has moments
onscreen that are as breathtakingly truthful as the script is
dishonest. She also knows how to have naughty-girl fun as Carla,
reveling in the newfound pleasures of just sitting around in her
very own apartment, belching aloud because she can. Ribisi, who was
so good in ``Saving Private Ryan,'' holds his own with a
performance that's fearless, but respectful.
</P>
<P>
   You can't say as much for the script. It keeps manipulating us
by putting Carla and Danny through the same series of events. First
it shows them being cute, then it shows them being humiliated, then
it shows them crying. Carla's big dream is to be a veterinary
assistant, and that's no surprise: The movie treats her and Danny
like adorable puppies, always in danger of accidentally peeing on
the rug. Danny even has to wear a puppy costume at one point (Carla
gets a swan outfit), and the script turns their sexual stirrings
into the source of nudge-nudge comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the most effective scene in ``The Other Sister'' is Lewis'
angry, tearful outburst when she thinks a roomful of people are
ridiculing her. You can understand her frustration, because of the
inconsistent way the movie treats its mentally challenged
characters. It wants us to laugh with them, but too often it's
laughing at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Other Sister''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Juliette Lewis, Giovanni Ribisi and Diane Keaton. Rated
PG-13 for thematic elements involving sex-related material.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A couple of strong performances get undercut by
glitz, jokes and sentimentality.

 &HT;    `Eight Millimeter' exposes itself as sham
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest sample of Morbidity Chic from ``Seven'' scripter
Andrew Kevin Walker, ``Eight Millimeter'' is like a morally
bankrupt public health official: It warns you about the dangers of
an illegal substance by making you indulge in the stuff till you're
sick.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, we're talking pornography. Not the slick pages of
Playboy, but the seamy bazaars of the kinkiest skinflicks. That's
because private eye Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) has been hired by a
rich widow (Myra Carter) to find out why her late husband had a
porn reel in his safe. And whether that movie is really what it
seems to be: a ``snuff'' flick, ending with the brutal slashing
death of a sad-eyed teenage girl.
</P>
<P>
   Tom's investigation takes him from his Pennsylvania home to
North Carolina, Los Angeles and Manhattan. Trying to track the
identity of the girl, and the movie's makers, he enlists the help
of an L.A. porn-store clerk, Max (Joaquin Phoenix, whose amusing,
street-smart performance is the best thing here).
</P>
<P>
   They find themselves in a murky world of filmmakers for hire,
willing to shoot anything for a price. Unfortunately, these guys
(played by the fine James Gandolfini and Peter Stormare) are as
two-dimensional as they are evil. As he uncovers ever worse ethical
squalor, Cage exhibits his moral outrage with a glum expression
that suggests the onset of a migraine. He's something I never
thought I'd say about him: boring. (Another casualty is the fine
actress Catherine Keener, reduced to a limited performance as
Cage's anxious wife.)
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with ``Eight Millimeter'' is the way it
turns us into voyeurs (like the rape-murder sequence in ``Strange
Days''), then gets self-righteous about what it's been showing us.
It's hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   When it came out in 1960, the British film ``Peeping Tom,''
about a photographer who takes pictures of women at the moment he
murders them, disgusted critics. And it ended director Michael
Powell's career. But it was trying to say something relevant about
the ways film can objectify reality and turn us all into voyeurs.
``Eight Millimeter'' has nothing on its mind but cheap sensation.
It pretends to explore moral ambiguity, then finds shortcuts so
that our man Tom can be both a hero and a vigilante whose actions
are as bloody as the porn sleazos'. More hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   But enough with the egghead analysis. Here's what you want to
know: This movie is also slow-going, punishingly grim and often
ugly to look at, in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as a set designer for TV commercials, director Joel
Schumacher does his usual job of visual oversell. The widow's
mansion is so comic-book baronial that you expect Alfred from the
director's two ``Batman'' movies to drift through. Other houses
seem to be lit by a single fluorescent light that bleaches color
from everything. The porn kings cavort in junky-baroque sets that
look like a sci-fi hand-me-down from ``Dark City'' director Alex
Proyas.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is to remove the movie from its moorings in the real
world. It turns everyday evil into a comic book, something we can
easily dismiss. It says that bad guys are out there. But don't
worry _ bang! pow! _ they can be beaten. The movie comes close to
real complexity only once, when one of the murderous creeps turns
out to be a bespectacled, next-door-Joe kind of guy. He even lives
with his mother. But before the implications of this can sink in,
out come the knives and guns for another bloody burst of action.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, ``Eight Millimeter'' is sharply done. It's an
exploitation flick tricked out as art. The pluses include a score
from Mychael Danna (a longtime collaborator of director Atom
Egoyan). It's a terrific mix of hushed percussion and Middle
Eastern-sounding vocals. But after a while, you realize that even
this is a questionable choice. It implicitly equates the porn
underworld with our fears of ``alien'' cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody could probably make a great movie that explores the
strange, sorry world of pornography: a parallel studio system
breeding in the shadows cast by Hollywood's klieg lights. ``Boogie
Nights'' came close, but it lost sight of what it was trying to
say. ``Eight Millimeter'' isn't even in the ballpark. It just drags
you through the mud.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the deepest thing it has to say is, ``Mean people
suck.'' You can get that message off a bumper sticker, for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight Millimeter''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix. Rated R for strong
language and for strong, perverse sexuality and violence. 2 hours,
</P>
<P>
   3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A depressing and unpleasant waste of talent.

 &HT;    `Cigarettes' misses the party, but brings hip cast, great music
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What little we know about Ellie midway through ``200
Cigarettes'' we really don't like: We've heard that she's a moody
performance artist who's chosen New Year's Eve, of all socially
stressful times, to dump her boyfriend, Kevin (Paul Rudd).
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop the audience at a recent Atlanta preview
from happily applauding Ellie's first onscreen appearance. ``That's
Janeane Garofalo!'' one woman whispered excitedly.
</P>
<P>
   And that pretty much seems to be the point of ``200
Cigarettes,'' a disjointed series of tales about more than a dozen
New Yorkers (with a few New Jerseyites and Long Islanders thrown in
for good measure) in 1981, all trying to get to the same New Year's
Eve party. From Courtney Love and Ben Affleck to Elvis Costello (!)
and Christina Ricci, the large ensemble cast is a would-be
hipster's dream, and it's that sense of shared coolness that the
filmmakers seem quite happy to substi-
</P>
<P>
   tute for any serious character development.
</P>
<P>
   Why else would they keep returning to Rudd and Love, a
thoroughly unlikable couple of platonic friends who set out to
attend the party together and proceed to whine their way through a
series of bars, diners and cab rides along the way?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just gonna go home and kill myself,'' Rudd declares in one
scene, for reasons we already don't care about.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Love earthily challenges him to have sex,
for reasons we already don't care about.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do we really care what happens to teenagers Val (the
ubiquitous Ricci) and Stephie (Gaby Hoffman). They can't remember
the address of the party they've sneaked in from Long Island to
attend (the duo's overly broad accents are more appropriate to
Staten Island, or maybe an early Bowery Boys movie), and they keep
running into a pair of punks (Casey Affleck and Guillermo Diaz) who
seem liable to hurt them whenever Val's not busy kissing them.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget (Nicole Parker) ditches Eric (Brian McCardie) when she
finds out that the party is being thrown by his ex-girlfriend
Monica (Martha Plimpton). Then Bridget scrounges the bars for
another date, while Eric demands that Monica tell him why he's a
loser with chicks.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, you'll be completely unsurprised to know by this
point, has to do with sex. In fact, everything in this movie has to
do with sex, which, truth be told, isn't interesting enough to
spend 90 minutes on. At least not in a movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   And yet ``200 Cigarettes'' is recommended viewing, if only for
the way it faithfully re-creates that pre-Reaganomics period in the
very early 1980s when women willingly dressed like Madonna's
version of a virgin, stereo turntables were more commonplace than
condoms, and love and fun _ not career and money _ were what really
mattered. Indeed, in one of the movie's slyer moments, Ben Affleck
turns off women by revealing that he's a third-year law student
planning to make a lot of money in real estate.
</P>
<P>
   There also are several excellent performances turned in by the
cast's less hip names. As party hostess Monica, Plimpton, who was
one of the hottest young actresses a decade ago in ``The Mosquito
Coast'' and ``Running on Empty,'' gets funnier the later the
evening gets and, still, no guests have arrived. And in her film
debut as the recently deflowered virgin and colossal klutz Cindy,
Kate Hudson winningly combines Lucille Ball-like physical comedic
skills with just a touch of the screwball line readings of her
mother, Goldie Hawn. Similarly, Jay Mohr, as Cindy's initially
unknowing deflowerer, and Dave Chapelle, as a grooving,
philosophizing cabbie, also seem to understand how not to overplay
their characters' hands.
</P>
<P>
   But the real star of ``200 Cigarettes'' is the music. From
Blondie and Roxy Music to Joe Jackson, Costello and Nick Lowe, the
authentic period music never stops playing or surprising us anew
with its freshness and its enduring hipness.
</P>
<P>
   ``200 Cigarettes''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck, Dave Chappelle, Guillermo
Diaz, Angela Featherstone, Janeane Garofalo, Gaby Hoffman, Kate
Hudson, Courtney Love, Jay Mohr, Martha Plimpton, Elvis Costello,
Christina Ricci and Paul Rudd. Rated R for language, sexual
situations and alcohol use. 1 hour, 27 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Like most New Year's Eve parties, this one fails to
live up to expectations. But the music is great.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray and Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affliction'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nick Nolte and James Coburn.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar nominee Nick Nolte gives a searing, career-defining
performance in this soul-weary study of one of the walking dead.
Nolte plays a troubled New England cop whose ``afflictions''
include an angry ex-wife, a frightened young daughter, a boss who
belittles him and a roaringly abusive father (James Coburn, also
Oscar-nominated). 1 hour, 44 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Blast From the Past'' PG-13 (profanity, sex, drug references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Fraser, Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Fraser does another culture-clash, fish-out-of-water
flick, playing a guy who climbs into the '90s after spending all
his life in a bomb shelter. You wait for the high-concept comedy to
make some smart observations (or at least some decent jokes) about
the collision of the '60s and '90s. But the humor and the plot are
amateurish, leaving its cast flailing.1 hour, 52 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia
Louis-Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   A multi-legged wonder. The newest computer-animated feature from
the makers of ``Toy Story'' is the eye-popping, witty tale of an
ant named Flik (voice of Dave Foley), who recruits a bunch of
circus bugs to battle evil grasshoppers (the chief villain is
voiced by Kevin Spacey). There's enough going on here to keep every
adult, child or arachnid vastly entertained. 1 hour, 34 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Central Station'' R (profanity and mature themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Fernanda Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   In this tender and unexpectedly moving Brazilian film, a sour
old woman (Oscar nominee Fernanda Montenegro) takes a motherless
boy she barely knows into rural Brazil to find the father he's
never met. Montenegro's performance is a beautiful study in
bitterness dissuaded, of possibility and optimism stumbled on after
too long an absence from someone's life. Subtitles. 1 hour, 55
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action'' PG-13 (profanity and mature themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a true story, this legal thriller stars John Travolta
as a small-time personal injury lawyer who tackles two giant
corporations. Oscar nominee Robert Duvall is his cagey opponent.
Travolta is miscast and the movie can't quite decide what its focus
is. Still, it more than makes its case with intelligence and
old-fashioned Hollywood ``let us entertain you'' craft. 2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the Delta'' PG-13 (profanity, drug references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alfre Woodard and Al Freeman Jr.
</P>
<P>
   This warm, funny, utterly engaging family film insists you can
go home again, even if you've never been there before. Alfre
Woodard stars as a messed-up Chicago single mom with two kids. Her
own mother (Mary Alice) ships her south to Mississippi to stay with
her uncle
</P>
<P>
   (Al Freeman Jr.) and try to get her life straight. 1 hour, 41
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight Millimeter'' R (strong perverse sexuality, violence,
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   A new example of Morbidity Chic from the screenwriter of
``Seven.'' Nicolas Cage plays a PI investigating the possible death
of a young girl in a snuff flick. It's an unpleasant crawl through
the world of porn; you can tell the filmmakers think it's a
troubling exploration of moral ambiguity, but it's an exploitation
flick tricked out as art. 2 hours, 3 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth'' R (violence and sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   This opulent period film puts a slight feminist gloss on the
early reign of 16th-century monarch Elizabeth I, showing her
transformation from a radiant, saucy innocent to a polished,
guarded ruler. Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett gives a luminous
portrayal, and Geoffrey Rush, also an Oscar nominee, gives her
sturdy support as court politics and intrigues swirl about. This is
a really good story. 2 hours, 4 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' At Fernbank Museum of Natural
History. 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters'' Not rated but sexual themes and brief
nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   Three Oscar nominations. A brilliant reimagining of the final
days of gay British director James Whale. Whale, best known for his
classic horror movies (``Bride of Frankenstein''), died
mysteriously in 1957. Played here by the marvelous Ian McKellen
(best actor), he's an isolated, forgotten recluse who becomes
interested in the hunky new gardener (Brendan Fraser). 1 hour, 35
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Jawbreaker'' R (profanity, sexuality and violence, all
involving teens)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Rose McGowan, Rebecca Gayheart and Judy Evans Greer.
</P>
<P>
   Rose McGowan is the queen of mean in this high school comedy
about four teen girls who terrorize the hallways. Things get
complicated when one of the four accidentally dies, and her friends
cover it up. The black comedy borrows heavily from ``Carrie'' and
``Heathers,'' but it has a snappy style all its own. 1 hour, 27
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' PG-13 (Holocaust-related atrocities)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Oscar nominations including best picture, best actor and
best screenplay. An Italian Jew shields his son from the horrors of
a concentration camp by pretending their predicament is part of a
big, complicated game. Roberto Benigni's low-comedy slapstick
approach isn't entirely convincing and is often chillingly
wrongheaded. Subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 2 hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Voice'' R (profanity, brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jane Horrocks, Brenda Blethyn and Michael Caine.
</P>
<P>
   British actress Jane Horrocks, who can belt out tone-perfect
impersonations of everyone from Judy Garland to Shirley Bassey, is
pretty much the whole show here. The rest of the film is a fairly
feeble show-biz fable in which her blowzy mom (Oscar nominee Brenda
Blethyn) and a seedy agent (Michael Caine) try to get this shy
recluse onstage.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 30 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Message in a Bottle'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn and Paul Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Two messages here: Old-fashioned romances still work, and Kevin
Costner needs an ego check. Badly. For a good while, the movie lets
us luxuriate in the pleasures of sailboats, sunsets, candlelit
dinners, etc. Plus, there's comic relief courtesy of Paul Newman
and Robbie Contrane. But the last 15 minutes are a lunkheaded
embarrassment and Costner (he co-produced) is to blame. 2 hours, 12
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Mighty Joe Young'' PG (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Paxton and Charlize Theron.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Paxton is a cute American zoologist, Charlize Theron is a
gorgeous blonde and her pal Joe is, well, a really big gorilla.
Together they stumble through the African jungle, California and,
overall, through this remake of the 1949 B-movie with shamelessly
stolen sequences from ``E.T.'' and ``It's a Wonderful Life.''
(Knight Ridder Newspapers)
</P>
<P>
   At area discount theaters. 1 hour, 55 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``My Favorite Martian'' PG (violence, partial nudity and
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jeff Daniels, Christopher Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   A big-screen remake of the '60s TV series, with the annoying and
unsubtle Christopher Lloyd as the Martian who camps in Jeff
Daniels' living room. The movie is cobbled together with cheesy
special effects and easy gags. But for kids, it's an OK babysitter.
1 hour, 33 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``October Sky'' PG (profanity, sensuality, alcohol use, some
thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper and Laura Dern.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply satisfying tale of West Virginia teen Homer (Jake
Gyllenhaal) and three friends who, in the 1950s, began to build and
shoot off model rockets. Their goal: to win a science fair, which
could help them escape a future of working in the coal mine of
their small town. Based on Homer Hickman's autobiography ``Rocket
Boys,'' it makes the process of learning seem as exciting as a
special FX-driven action flick. 1 hour, 48 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Office Space'' R (profanity, partial nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ron Livingston, Jennifer Aniston, Stephen Root and Gary
Cole.
</P>
<P>
   An amusingly and eerily familiar comedy for anyone who's ever
struggled against the monotonous mind control of a large corporate
workplace. After wittily building audience resentment for nearly 90
minutes, writer-director Mike Judge (TV's ``Beavis &AMP; Butt-head,''
``King of the Hill'') seems to pull his punches with a
less-than-apocalyptic ending.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 30 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Other Sister'' PG-13 (thematic elements involving
sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Juliette Lewis and Diane Keaton.
</P>
<P>
   Juliette Lewis' effective performance as a mentally challenged
woman is the best reason to see this comedy drama, an uneasy
mixture of sentimentality and yucks. Diane Keaton plays her
overprotective mother, and Giovanni Ribisi (also very strong) is
the man she falls for. 2 hours, 11 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams'' PG-13 (profanity, crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays a renegade med student who believes the
rigid rules of health care could use a few laughs. It's ``Dead
Poets Society'' with lab coats. The laughs are good, but when it
tries to get serious (often), the flick is as deep as a bedpan. 1
hour, 56 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Payback'' R (violence, profanity, drug and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mel Gibson and Gregg Henry.
</P>
<P>
   A by-the-numbers vengeance thriller starring Mel Gibson. It's as
generic as its unnamed, dull gray city. 1 hour, 42 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' PG (violence, intense themes)
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Val Kilmer and Ralph Fiennes.
</P>
<P>
   A spectacular animated musical epic that retells _ with some
embellishments _ the Book of Exodus. Val Kilmer is the voice of
Moses, God's choice to lead the Hebrew people from slavery in
Egypt. Ralph Fiennes speaks for the Pharaoh, Moses' ``adopted''
brother. Other talent includes Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and
a host of animators. The movie is visually impressive, insistently
reverential.1 hour, 39 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushmore'' R (profanity and brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Olivia Williams.
</P>
<P>
   This original prep school fable pits 15-year-old Max (Jason
Schwartzman) against a tycoon (Bill Murray) in a battle for the
love of a schoolteacher (Olivia Williams). The second film from
director Wes Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson proves that they
haven't lost the off-kilter wit and viewpoint they first showed in
``Bottle Rocket.''
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 33 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' R (extreme violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon and Edward Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven Oscar nominations including best picture. Part gung-ho
heroism, part in-your-face horror show, Steven Spielberg's superb
film shows us World War II as we've never seen it before. Tom Hanks
leads a courageous squad on a mission to find a private whose three
brothers have already been killed in combat. At metro theaters. 2
hours, 50 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' R (sexuality, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen Oscar nominations including best picture. Poor,
overworked Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) has to finish his play
``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'' and try to win the hand
of noblewoman Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) in this witty comedy that
uses some of the Bard's more outrageous plot devices. 2 hours, 2
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``She's All That'' PG-13 (profanity, sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Freddie Prinze Jr., Rachael Leigh Cook.
</P>
<P>
   High school star Zack (Freddie Prinze Jr.) accepts a bet to turn
geeky Laney (Rachael Leigh Cook) into a prom queen, and falls in
love with her. An amusing, genial reworking of ``Pygmalion,'' the
comedy has one big problem: Its leads are beautiful, but distant. 1
hour, 37 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``A Simple Plan'' R (profanity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Anything but simple, this is a character-driven black comedy
with some powerful moral-qualm undercurrents. In the deep snows of
rural Minnesota, two brothers (Bill Paxton, Oscar nominee Billy Bob
Thornton) and a pal (Brent Briscoe) find a downed plane with $4
million in cash. Their ``simple plan'' to split the money leads to
a chain of increasingly disastrous events. 1 hour, 57 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Steam: The Turkish Bath'' Not rated but has adult sexual
themes.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alessandro Gassman.
</P>
<P>
   Did not open last week as indicated. An Italian yuppie goes to
Istanbul to dispose of the property left him by his aunt. He
intends to sell everything and get home quickly, but once there,
he's seduced. By the city, by a warmhearted Turkish family, by a
new sense of himself and his sexuality. The plot is soggily
familiar, but as a love letter to Istanbul, it is quite wonderful.
Subtitles. 1 hour, 34 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepmom'' PG-13 (profanity, adult themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts play competing moms _ one
biological, the other step _ in this comedy/weepie that tackles
some complex ``blended family'' issues, then cops out by giving a
character a fatal disease. Still, the sturdy cast does much to
redeem the mush-headed script (add Ed Harris in the dishonest role
of doting dad who somehow never sees his kids).
</P>
<P>
   2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thin Red Line'' R (profanity and war violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, Nick Nolte, Woody Harrelson
and Adrien Brody.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Oscar nominations including best picture. Less a war movie
than a meditation on life, death, love, hate, man and nature.
Terrence Malick puts his unmistakable stamp on the drama of an Army
division's struggle to capture Guadalcanal from the Japanese during
World War II. 2 hours, 50 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``T. rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional
story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a budding teenage
paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her dino-hunting dad
(Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be a dinosaur egg
into his lab, Ally, alone with it, accidentally cracks it and is
thrust back in time 65 million years, when the big beasts roamed
the Earth.40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``200 Cigarettes'' R (profanity, sexual situations, alcohol use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Courtney Love, Ben Affleck and Christina Ricci.
</P>
<P>
   Like a New Year's Eve nightmare writ large, numerous New Yorkers
struggle to hook up with someone on the way to an end-of-1991
party. Most of the characters are obnoxious and sex-obsessed, but a
few performances, the only-in-the '80s outfits and most especially,
the music, shine through. 1 hour, 27 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Varsity Blues'' R (profanity, sexuality, nudity, substance
abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Van Der Beek and Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   James Van Der Beek plays a high school football player in this
insulting mix of beery teenage humor and rampant sexuality. 1 hour,
40 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Waking Ned Devine'' PG (sexual themes, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian Bannen and David Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   A broad, twinkly Irish comedy about what happens in a tiny
village when it's discovered that one of the residents is the
holder of a lottery ticket worth nearly $7 million. The movie is a
little too eager to please, a little too Lucky Charms Irish. But
the two leads, devilish old-pro codgers Ian Bannen and David Kelly,
are practiced charmers, and there are lots of winning little
moments along the way. 1 hour, 30 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   This Internet-era update of ``The Shop Around the Corner'' stars
Tom Hanks as a book-chain magnate and Meg Ryan as the small-store
owner he's putting out of business. Little do they know that
they're each other's e-mail sweethearts. ``Sleepless in Seattle''
director Nora Ephron gets the charm working again in a remake that
delivers.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray and Jill Vejnoska write for the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

FROM GEEKS TO GROWNUPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `Adult'' is one of those perfectly good words that cautious
people handle with tongs. Once used only to describe hard-won
maturity, it's also come to symbolize the kind of sordid amusements
immortalized in the Starr Report.
</P>
<P>
   So give America Online Inc. credit for boldness, as they roll
out a new Internet service frankly targeted at adult consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Did I say new? Not really. In fact, we're talking about
CompuServe.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago, AOL completed its acquisition of CompuServe,
the one-time leader in on-line services. To oldtime CompuServers
like me, it was a somber event. While AOL served up family-friendly
fluff for the clueless, CompuServe made its name as the on-line
service for people who knew what they were doing. Its 500
special-interest forums were the place to go for sophisticated
discussions on computers or nearly anything else. Seeing AOL devour
CompuServe would be like watching People magazine buy The New
Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   There was talk that AOL would make like the Borg, totally
assimilating CompuServe into the grand collective. Happily, AOL is
far too clever for that. CompuServe is a valuable brand name, and
the company is moving to make the most of it, with new software and
a shift in marketing focus from geeks to grownups.
</P>
<P>
   AOL blundered in naming the new service CompuServe 2000. Adding
those four digits to a product name makes it sound instantly
out-of-date, like Microsoft's Windows 2000, which has a taint of
obsolescence even though it hasn't gone on sale yet.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the name, there's an upgraded version of good old
CompuServe. The new software completes work that CompuServe began
years ago, converting the system to HTML, the coding method used to
design Web pages. Everything in the new CompuServe appears inside a
Microsoft Web browser that's part of the software.
</P>
<P>
   This method is actually a bit less powerful than the old
software. For instance, you can no longer download dozens of forum
messages at a time, then read them after you've logged off. Also,
some features remain lamentably clunky. The old CompuServe featured
the world's worst software for reading Usenet bulletin board
messages. The new version uses AOL's Usenet software, which is
merely the second-worst.
</P>
<P>
   And here's a geek tragedy for you: no more Telnet access.
Telnet's a program that lets you talk to other computers using a
plain-vanilla text-only display. Gearheads loved CompuServe because
it was the only on-line service that would let you Telnet in from
any computer on the Internet. You can still get e-mail that way,
but none of the other CompuServe features.
</P>
<P>
   CompuServe chief operating officer Audrey Weil says her firm
can't count on techies for survival. Most of them will bypass the
on-line services altogether and head straight for the Internet.
Instead, CompuServe 2000 is targeting serious, mature, but
nontechnical computer users.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at 17 million people coming on to the Internet for the
first time in 1999, and more than half of those are adults,'' Weil
says. ``This service is targeted at busy adults.''
</P>
<P>
   It's even priced that way _ $9.95 a month for 20 hours. Weil
says the typical CompuServe user isn't like the AOLers who live on
line. They'll want to log on, find what they need, and log off. So
they shouldn't have to pay for ``unlimited'' access they'll never
use.
</P>
<P>
   Weil's on to something here. I pay $14.90 a month for
CompuServe, yet I find myself using it less and less _ just nine
minutes in January, according to my billing records. The new
pricing would save me almost $60 a year, without interfering with
my CompuServe habits.
</P>
<P>
   And even though I use the service less frequently, I'd hate to
give it up altogether. CompuServe is still one of the best places
to find reliable data and intelligent discourse. Indeed, that's a
vital part of AOL's business plan.
</P>
<P>
   Weil says CompuServers are an affluent, educated bunch, and 80
percent of them buy things on line. So even though CompuServe's
audience of 2 million is far smaller than AOL's 16 million, the
CompuServe audience is especially attractive to advertisers, who'll
pay lavishly to entice us.
</P>
<P>
   The on-line porn merchants like to claim that catering to adults
is the best way to find profit on the Internet. For once, I hope
they're right.

STANLEY PROVIDES FIRST AID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ At the time, it must have seemed like an act
of appeasement, Jimy Williams's way of taking the sting away when
he told Mike Stanley that he would no longer be catching for the
Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have a first baseman's glove, Williams asked in the
spring of 1997. If not, do you think you could get one? We'd like
you to take some ground balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Mo Vaughn the same day,'' Stanley said Wednesday,
``and he gave me a first baseman's glove, one with his name in it.
I still have that glove. It's the one I use in games.''
</P>
<P>
   That glove appears destined to show some worn leather this
spring. Stanley, his career redirected by Williams's suggestion, is
a candidate to log some serious time at first base for the Red Sox,
a role he hasn't known since he was in college at the University of
Florida 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``So long ago I can't remember it,'' said Stanley, who is
occupying Vaughn's locker, wearing his glove, and perhaps, taking
on some of his leadership qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sign that says you've got to go to the last
locker,'' Stanley said, alluding to the daily gathering of
reporters around Vaughn's locker.
</P>
<P>
   But at age 35, and with 13 seasons in the big leagues behind
him, Stanley ranks as the Sox' most experienced position player.
Only pitcher Bret Saberhagen, who broke into the big leagues in
1985, has been around longer than Stanley, whose debut with the
Texas Rangers came a year later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as vocal as Mo was,'' Stanley said. ``Mine is more a
by-example-type thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not afraid to say something when it's time to talk,
either. Not in a scolding manner, but as a guy who has been around
the league for awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley is in his second go-round with the Sox, who traded him
to the Yankees for prospects late in 1997, when the Yankees needed
a bat for the stretch drive, then recaquired him from Toronto last
July, when Boston had the same need for its run at a wild-card
spot. Stanley did not disappoint, batting .288 with seven home runs
and 32 RBIs in 47 games.
</P>
<P>
   With Vaughn gone, first base could end up being a shared
proposition, depending on how Williams intends to use newcomer Jose
Offerman. But with Stanley's 29 home runs last season making him
second only to Nomar Garciaparra among Red Sox returnees, it stands
to reason Williams will want Stanley in the lineup on close to an
everyday basis, either at first base or as the DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I get that sense? I get that hope,'' Stanley said. ``It's
out of my control, obviously. I just come with the thoughts of
that's the kind of goal you set for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``All things being equal, if we start the season  &UR; tomorrow &LR; ,
I've got to go see the lineup card to see who's in there. Nothing
is guaranteed at all. You just go with that hope and that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley played some first base for the Sox when Vaughn went down
with a knee injury in '97, then wound up there last spring in
Toronto, where the Blue Jays had signed him to be a
righthanded-hitting DH but were forced to use him at first when
young star Carlos Delgado was injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really starting to enjoy my time over there,'' Stanley
said. ``I was kind of sad and reluctant to let it go. At first,
they said he wouldn't be back till the end of May. When he came
back after just two weeks in April, it was like, `Oh, man.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who had balked in the past at being used as the DH, went
along with Williams when he started Stanley a dozen times at first
base upon his return to Boston for last summer's stretch run.
Stanley didn't make an error for the Red Sox, and only made one in
22 games for the Blue Jays at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``From time to time, I had played first base in the minors, and
I also played there in winter ball in the Dominican,'' Stanley
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't something that I had to go learn where to put my
feet on the bag, or do you hold a runner on or not. I've got some
instincts about playing the position.''
</P>
<P>
   The toughest part about playing first base for the Sox, Stanley
suggested, is learning how to handle the throws from shortstop
Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got all types of different (arm) angles,'' Stanley said.
``His is not your true, over-the-top Alan Trammell throw. His throw
is sinking and it's hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, the break is pretty consistent. But still, when he
makes that little running play he likes to do, where he throws off
one leg, that can handcuff me in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley doesn't believe the Red Sox are doomed by Vaughn's
departure, even though talking hitting with Vaughn was among the
most pleasurable aspects of the job for him. Neither should anyone
believe that the Yankees will match last year's 114-win regular
season, even if they have basically the same team, plus Roger
Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was such a magical achievement,'' he said. ``To sit and
think they can repeat that because they have the same cast of
players is unfair and unrealistic. Sure, they're the favorites, but
it's unrealistic to think they'll do what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley accepts that the Sox could end up trading for another
first baseman. But in the meantime, there are some new first
baseman's mitts that need breaking in.

A PROBING POST-MORTEM OF A MARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
The Story of One Marriage 
By John Taylor 
Random House, 240 pp. $22.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Plane crashes have many causes _ metal fatigue, pilot error,
wind shear _ and so do failed marriages, including but not limited
to incompatibility, infidelity, and inertia.
</P>
<P>
   One difference, though, is that when an airliner goes down, an
investigation is usually launched and relevant information gets
passed along to the public. Not so with most marriages, which,
absent an equivalent black-box investigation, sink without a trace,
leaving behind a pool of bewildered survivors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the valuable services John Taylor renders in this
brooding, oddly affecting memoir is essentially a forensic one.
Taylor, a former staff writer for New York and Esquire magazines,
sets out to examine how and why his own 11-year marriage imploded.
He is hopeful that his inquest can enlighten others. He is not out
to settle scores with his ex _ how refreshing is that in this age
of literary payback? _ or to dish dirt on colleagues, but to
explain his observation that while it ``requires will to make a
marriage work, it also requires a horrifying act of will to make
one end.''
</P>
<P>
   Horrifying yes, but in its way admirable too. Taylor is too
gifted, too smart a writer to duck the tough questions or
romanticize his own pain. His foibles and failings _ the drinking
bouts and temper tantrums, the ways in which he rationalized his
extramarital affairs, the lies told his spouse and the trauma
inflicted on his daughter _ are recalledwith a conspicuous lack of
self-pity. He can be funny, as in describing the therapy sessions
to which he was dragged by one romantic partner or another. He can
be brutally candid, as in portraying his conflicting emotions about
leaving or staying, ending the marriage or extending it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure,'' he observes, ``can be gratifying, even liberating;
it relieves you of the need to aspire.'' He goes on to compare his
crippled marriage and its principals to ``animals in a drought''
who survive ``by keeping still and doing little.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Taylor pretends to be an unbiased witness. On the
contrary, it is his bias that gives his book its peculiar shape,
its gritty texture, its melancholy resonance. ``At what precise
point does the breakdown of a marriage become irretrievable?'' he
asks, and then makes you want to know the answer. Not The Truth,
necessarily, but his truth. Which is all one can ask for.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and his wife Maureen married in 1982, 18 months after
they met. He was 26 at the time, she a few years older. As their
romance flourished, so did Taylor's career. He cannot remember who
proposed marriage first, only that marriage and family life was
something to which he had always aspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me,'' he writes, ``marriage was a way not of settling down
but of moving on'' from a life of chronic restlessness. Shortly
after marrying, though, Maureen was diagnosed with Parkinson's
disease. The couple moved from Boston to Brooklyn, and Maureen
stayed home when their baby was born. It was, Taylor acknowledges,
a ``power shift'' that bred resentment and caused the couple to
withdraw, emotionally and physically.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, he began an affair with a young married woman whom
he calls Alex. Their affair seemed ``rakish'' and ``glamorous''
initially, says Taylor. He even imagined himself alongside other
celebrity adulterers, from President Kennedy to Picasso. Meanwhile,
he scorned one neighbor of his who boasted of his own ``open
marriage,'' as if cheating in secret were a lesser matrimonial
crime than serial wife-swapping. He and Alex took a small apartment
together. Gradually she began seeing Taylor as the exit visa to her
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife's physical condition worsening and Alex pressuring
him to leave, Taylor found himself going through the motions in a
marriage that had lost its moorings. Ending the affair with Alex,
he confessed his infidelity to his wife while asking for a ``trial
separation,'' the first big step toward divorce. He moved out, they
agreed to see a marriage counselor, yet he also began another
affair. Four months later, Taylor went back to wife and daughter,
in what proved to be another futile stab at domestic tranquility.
This time around even their therapist diagnosed the couple as
depressingly ``low-energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The endgame would go on for two more ennervating years, Taylor's
career being about the only thing that was flying on all engines.
At home his goal was modest to a fault: to keep a low profile, to
avoid confrontation. One more affair, however, this time with a
woman firmly committed to her own marriage, was the last Mayday
before the plane went down. In the end, it was his wife who found
the courage to say, enough.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders what Taylor's daughter will make of this memoir when
she is old enough to approach it with adult eyes. Perhaps she will
view it as an act of betrayal, perhaps an act of bravery. One thing
she will not have to ask is, ``What exactly happened between you
and Mommy?''

LABOR AND WOMEN PUSH FOR EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nobody says men and women shouldn't get equal pay
for doing the same job. But what's brewing now is a big push
nationally by the president, organized labor, and women's rights
groups to level the gender playing field on wages for different but
equivalent work.
</P>
<P>
   In a strategy session Thursday, Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa
Democrat who has been the lonely champion of pay-equity legislation
since 1996, was to meet with John Podesta, the president's chief of
staff, and other officials on ways the White House can boost his
bill this year. Wednesday, the AFL-CIO launched a nationwide
campaign to pass comparable-worth bills in 24 states.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here? Trying to determine comparable salaries
for jobs traditionally held by men and women is an old idea,
discredited by some economists as unwieldly, if not downright dumb.
They wonder who can and will decide the economic value of a riveter
versus a nurse, the comparable pay for a probation officer and a
librarian, the equivalent salary for an auto mechanic and a
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Many see pay equity, even if it is difficult to enforce, as the
only remedy for wage discrimination, a problem that persists for
women, even as they have earned advanced degrees, climbed the
corporate ladder, and plopped their children in day care while
pursuing fulltime jobs in huge numbers.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study released by the AFL-CIO Wednesday, the
average working family loses more than $4,000 each year to the
gender wage gap, which has narrowed very little in recent years.
Women still tend to be clustered in lower-paying, female-dominated
occupations and, on average each week, earn 74 percent of men's
wages, the report said. Minority women earn 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``For too long, working women have been seething while
politicians have remained silent,'' said Karen Nussbaum, director
of the AFL-CIO's Working Women's department. ``Pay equity can right
a longstanding wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, pollsters are telling politicians the wage gap is
starting to show up as a big issue for American families. It was no
accident that in his State of the Union message last month,
President Clinton asked Congress to ``make sure women and men get
equal pay by strengthening enforcement of equal pay laws.'' It was
one of the few declarations that got a standing ovation from both
Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also devoted his Jan. 30 radio address to the issue and
proposed a $14 million equal-pay initiative to help the Labor
Department break glass ceilings and end wage discrimination against
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay equity has gone from being a women's issue to a national
priority because there is enormous documentation _ from focus
groups to town hall meetings _ that unequal pay for women undercuts
family security in two-wage-earner families,'' said Anne Mosle, an
analyst at the Center for Policy Alternatives, a private,
nonpartisan group that studies women's economic issues. ``The more
wives work, the more husbands notice the gap, and they don't like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is also getting major lobbying support from organized
labor, which advertises a narrower gender wage gap for union
members _ women in unions earn 84 percent of men's wages _ as a way
to recruit women. The AFL-CIO recently set up an equal-pay web site
that allows a woman to tap in her age, income, and education level
and _ ``if you're ready for some really bad news,'' it says _ click
to see how much more a man with the same data will earn in his
lifetime. (The website is http://www.aflcio.org/women/calculat.htm)
</P>
<P>
   Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a resident fellow at the American
Enterprise Institute, says there are plenty of reasons why men and
women earn different wages _ seniority, job risk, and market demand
for certain skills _ that have nothing to do with discrimination
and would not be erased by ``cockeyed'' pay-equity laws. She said
when you compare men and women with the same qualifications doing
the same jobs, women earn 95 percent of men's salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comparable worth is certainly making a comeback,''
Furchtgott-Roth said, ``and I believe it's because feminists who
supported Clinton through the Lewinsky mess are demanding a
political payoff. I don't see any Republican support for these
proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Democratic equal-pay bills are expected to be introduced in
the GOP-controlled Congress next week. Harkin's Fair Pay Act would
provide equal pay for women in jobs of comparable skill, effort,
responsibility, and working conditions to low-skill jobs held by
men. The Paycheck Fairness Act, sponsored by Senate Minority Leader
Thomas Daschle of South Dakota, would strengthen penalties under
the 1963 Equal Pay Act, including awarding compensatory and
punitive damages to women who prove wage discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new momentum for the federal pay-equity bills, the
flurry of activity in state legislatures is perhaps more
significant because of the bubble-up effect. For example, 15 states
passed family and medical leave laws before it became a federal
priority and was enacted in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's pay-equity law, passed in 1982, stands as the
current model. Under it, cities, counties, and school districts in
the state must correct any sex-based inequities in salaries for
employees in equivalent jobs. A state bureaucracy helps evaluate
jobs based on what knowledge, skill, effort, and responsibility
they require. According to the National Committee on Pay Equity, a
private advocacy group, the wage gap between men and women in
Minnesota is 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, West Virginia, a state with a big gap in the median
salaries of men and women, passed a bill to protect state employees
from gender discrimination in wages paid for ``work of comparable
character.'' The legislation will not take effect until 2001 while
a state commission studies how to implement the law and handle
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Barring wage discrimination for ``work of comparable character''
is already on the books in Massachusetts, but state courts have
defined it so narrowly that state Representative Patricia Jehlen, a
Democrat of Somerville, recently introduced legislation to broaden
it to include jobs that require comparable skill, effort,
responsibility, and working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The language of the bills is the easy part; it's the
implmentation that is a ``swamp,'' said Wendy Rose of the Maine
Centers for Women, Work, and Community, a nonprofit group in
Augusta. Maine has had the nation's most far-reaching
comparable-worth law on the books since 1965 _ it requires both
public and private employers to pay equal wages for similar jobs _
but only in the last year, when pressed by advocacy groups, has the
state's Labor Department begun to develop enforcement rules and
tools.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1965 executive order, the US Labor Department is
required to audit federal contractors for wage discrimination. The
Clinton administration has recently stepped up enforcement; last
year the agency charged with contract compliance reviewed more pay
cases and got more settlements than ever in its history.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Texaco agreed to pay $3.1 million to women in
professional and executive positions after the Labor Department
cited the company for inconsistencies in its wage policies. It
included $2.2 million in back pay and interest and $900,000 in
raises.
</P>
<P>
   The government also got settlements in the last year from
CoreStates Financial, a Philadelphia-based bank, which paid $1.5
million in back pay and increased wages to 142 women and
minorities; Chicago publisher R.R. Donnelley &AMP; Sons, which paid 29
women and minorities $425,000 in lost wages; and US Airways, which
paid $400,000 to 30 women managers.

FIRST-TIME AUTHOR SAYS ECONOMY WORKS BETTER WITH LESS PLANNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Progress can best be made by those not preoccupied with planning
the future.
</P>
<P>
   That's the counterintuitive message delivered in a new book from
first-time author Virginia Postrel, who argues that dynamic growth
in business and the economy is possible only when individuals are
free to experiment and react to market forces instead of slavishly
relying on blueprint models that may not reflect the desires and
demands of today's marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Future and Its Enemies: The Growing Conflict Over
Creativity Enterprise and Progress'' (The Free Press, $25, 265
pages), Postrel carefully constructs an argument suggesting that
the ``invisible hand'' driving economic movement is a much more
powerful and effective force than today's scientific approach to
``master planning.''
</P>
<P>
   By predeterming progress by plotting out future developments far
ahead of time, America's growing technocracy can stifle spontaneous
evolution in business rather than pave the way for further
industrial growth and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technocratic governance transfers to deliberate, centralized
authorities decisions that would otherwise be made nimbly, through
competition and feedback in dispersed, evolving markets but also
for ideas,'' Postrel writes.
</P>
<P>
   Although the author criticizes the meddling role of government
in business affairs, she is no advocate of conservative thinkers
who work to merely maintain the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Calling these individuals ``reactionaries,'' Postrel contends
that such an outlook can be equally effective in pre-empting
progress that leads to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an overarching fear of the future _ and the need to
either manage it or to keep it from evolving at all _ actually
casts ultraliberals and ultraconservatives in the same camp, she
writes.
</P>
<P>
   A growing group _ dubbed ``dynamists'' by the author _ is
beginning to embrace the future by rolling with the punches and
adapting to society and markets forces as they change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a party that has no true political or intellectual home
in America today, a party that barely recognizes itself as an
entity,'' Postrel writes. ``Its central value is learning, which
unlike stability or control is an open-ended process. Dynamists do
not expect, demand or desire a world that holds still.''
</P>
<P>
   Postrel sprinkles her work with effective examples of the way
the serendipity of market forces have created fundamental changes
more sweeping than anyone could have planned.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, for example, sprang from its roots as a
low-profile Defense Department project to emerge as a far-reaching
communications network that has become suitable for the mass
market.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the U.S. semiconductor industry _ considered to be a
weakling in need of government funding and protectionist trade
barriers as recently as the 1980s _ roared back to world dominance
this decade even though only modest government programs and plans
were ever enacted.
</P>
<P>
   The power of the marketplace, it seems, was enough to encourage
the innovation that helped U.S. semiconductor makers regain the
upper hand in their industry. Had the manufacturers been sheltered
by government, Postrel writes, the industry may not have felt the
pressure to innovate and very well still could be saddled with
old-style thinking that could have relegated the nation to
second-class status in the vital semiconductor industry.
</P>
<P>
   Stodgy thinking even invades everyday businesses, such as
hairstyling. Postrel decibes a situation in New York where state
licensing exams test would-be hairstylists on outmoded hairstyling
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   It's a situation that prompts hair-styling schools to teach only
old styling techniques, so their students can pass their exam. As a
result, new techniques, such as African-style braiding of hair, are
never taught to students even though the demand for such styles is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   While many readers still may find comfort in the security that
comes from the planning process, Postrel provides some important
food for thought for those seeking to encourage creativity and
innovation in their workplace.

   Three years after his first book on economic opportunities for
African-Americans, author and speaker George Fraser has been
scouring the country for more material. He found it, and his new
book is full of interesting anecdotes about the economic viability
of the black community. After civil rights and affirmative action
programs, Fraser suggests that the next move for African-Americans
is in economic gains. His book could help his community further
this effort through inspiring tales of economic opportunity.

   Indeed, an overarching fear of the future _ and the need to
either manage it or to keep it from evolving at all _ actually
casts ultraliberals and ultraconservatives in the same camp, she
writes.
</P>
<P>
   A growing group _ dubbed ``dynamists'' by the author _ is
beginning to embrace the future by rolling with the punches and
adapting to society and markets forces as they change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a party that has no true political or intellectual home
in America today, a party that barely recognizes itself as an
entity,'' Postrel writes. ``Its central value is learning, which
unlike stability or control is an open-ended process. Dynamists do
not expect, demand or desire a world that holds still.''
</P>
<P>
   Postrel sprinkles her work with effective examples of the way
the serendipity of market forces have created fundamental changes
more sweeping than anyone could have planned.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, for example, sprang from its roots as a
low-profile Defense Department project to emerge as a far-reaching
communications network that has become suitable for the mass
market.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the U.S. semiconductor industry _ considered to be a
weakling in need of government funding and protectionist trade
barriers as recently as the 1980s _ roared back to world dominance
this decade even though only modest government programs and plans
were ever enacted.
</P>
<P>
   The power of the marketplace, it seems, was enough to encourage
the innovation that helped U.S. semiconductor makers regain the
upper hand in their industry. Had the manufacturers been sheltered
by government, Postrel writes, the industry may not have felt the
pressure to innovate and very well still could be saddled with
old-style thinking that could have relegated the nation to
second-class status in the vital semiconductor industry.
</P>
<P>
   Stodgy thinking even invades everyday businesses, such as
hairstyling. Postrel decibes a situation in New York where state
licensing exams test would-be hairstylists on outmoded hairstyling
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   It's a situation that prompts hair-styling schools to teach only
old styling techniques, so their students can pass their exam. As a
result, new techniques, such as African-style braiding of hair, are
never taught to students even though the demand for such styles is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   While many readers still may find comfort in the security that
comes from the planning process, Postrel provides some important
food for thought for those seeking to encourage creativity and
innovation in their workplace.

America''
</P>
<P>
   By George C. Fraser
</P>
<P>
   Avon Books, $13.50
</P>
<P>
   Three years after his first book on economic opportunities for
African-Americans, author and speaker George Fraser has been
scouring the country for more material. He found it, and his new
book is full of interesting anecdotes about the economic viability
of the black community. After civil rights and affirmative action
programs, Fraser suggests that the next move for African-Americans
is in economic gains. His book could help his community further
this effort through inspiring tales of economic opportunity.

RELIGIOUS FREEDOM SEEN AT RISK IN RUSSIAN CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Religious freedom is on trial in a stuffy Moscow
courtroom, where a judge is hearing a case on whether a sect can be
banned because its beliefs and practices are alien to Russian
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are Jehovah's Witnesses, who prosecutors say are
guilty of fomenting religious discord. So far, the prosecutor's
line of argument could be summed up: The authorities do not like
Jehovah's Witnesses, so they should be banned.
</P>
<P>
   The case is the first legal test for a 1997 law that names four
traditional Russian religions _ Orthodox Christianity, Islam,
Judaism, and Buddhism _ and sets tough criteria for other faiths to
win legal recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates warn that a ruling against the Jehovah's
Witnesses could be used as a precedent to outlaw any religious
group that falls out of official favor.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors' evidence comes not from any specific allegations of
wrongdoing but from charges that the group's doctrine is that of a
totalitarian cult. For example, because Jehovah's Witnesses are
discouraged from having blood transfusions, prosecutors say they
refuse care to ill people and encourage suicide. Or, because
Jehovah's Witnesses proclaim their faith as the only legitimate
one, prosecutors say, they foment discord with other groups.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Yelena Prokhorcheva has refused to accept such arguments,
saying that members of many faiths believe theirs to be the only
true one. The prosecutors see her reasoning as biased, and have
repeatedly asked the judge to excuse herself from the case. The
defendants say that the prosecutors' approach just shows they have
no case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have yet to see evidence for the trial,'' said Vasily
Kalin, a Jehovah's Witnesses' lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   If Prokhorcheva finds against the defendants, the Jehovah's
Witnesses, who claim 10,000 members in Moscow and 250,000
nationwide, would be banned from worshiping in the Russian capital.
</P>
<P>
   But the implications could be even greater.
</P>
<P>
   If the prosecution wins ``this case, they can easily use it as a
precedent to close down groups throughout Russia,'' said Diederik
Lohman, director of the Moscow office of the international
organization Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   But even if it does not win, the rules governing Russian legal
proceedings make it easy for the prosecution to drag out the case
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the prosecutor faxed a request for a recess 45
minutes after the proceedings were supposed to start. The case was
already postponed in November to allow the prosecution more time to
prepare its case. In the meantime, state-owned television has run
several reports critical of the Jehovah's Witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are conecerned that this delay is just another excuse to
manufacture evidence through a smear campaign,'' Kalin, a lawyer
for the Jehovah's Witnesses, said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 law has been widely criticized as a vehicle for
Russia's Orthodox Church, which lobbied hard for its adoption, to
reestablish itself as the country's official state religion after
decades of Soviet repression.
</P>
<P>
   The church and state were closely linked until the 1917 Russian
Revolution that brought an atheist regime to power.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 law requires any religion deemed ``nontraditional'' to
wait 15 years before acquiring official status, and makes it hard
for believers to worship in the meantime. During this probation
period, so-called nontraditional religions cannot own property,
open a bank account, publish and spread literature, or invite
foreign preachers to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Jehovah's Witnesses were registered under a Soviet-era
religious law, but after the 1997 law was passed, they were told to
register again. In the fall their application was blocked by
Moscow's city prosecutor on the basis of charges lodged against
Jehovah's Witnesses by a youth group close to the Russian Orthodox
Church.

IN RURAL RUSSIA, THE RETURN OF ANTISEMITISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOROVICHI, Russia _ Eduard Alexeyev flipped through the latest
batch of anonymous hate mail that turned up at his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get your stinking family out of Russia,'' one letter read.
</P>
<P>
   ``Streets will be washed with Jewish blood,'' read another.
``Every Friday there will be a pogrom.''
</P>
<P>
   Such messages are routine these days for Alexeyev, 29, leader of
the tiny Jewish community of Borovichi, a provincial factory town
of 80,000 that has become a center of the new wave of anti-Semitism
sweeping rural Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, a burly man in his 40s assessed the distance to
his own apartment balcony, 150 yards across the courtyard. This was
Alexei Finkelshtein, Alexeyev's friend and unofficial ``security
chief'' and an avid collector of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone tries a pogrom, give me a call and I'll fire a few
rounds above their heads,'' Finkelshtein said, only half joking.
``That'll calm them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Tensions in this town 240 miles north of Moscow have risen
sharply in recent weeks, since the neo-fascist group, Russian
National Unity, known as RNE in Russia, became active here.
</P>
<P>
   RNE's swastika-wearing followers preach a message of hatred,
blaming Jews and other ``foreign people'' for Russia's recent
economic problems and calling for the establishment of ``Russian
order.'' Posters and stickers with anti-Semitic slogans and
pictures have gone up at bus stops and on sign posts and store
windows. Jewish graves were vandalized at the local cemetery.
Someone painted a red Star of David on a Jewish family's door and
set fire to it.
</P>
<P>
   And Alexeyev has been receiving those letters.
</P>
<P>
   Every Sunday, RNE men in their trademark black shirts and red
swastika armbands gather in Borovichi's center to distribute
anti-Semitic material and enlist young recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Russia is nothing like the openly anti-Semitic
regimes of the Soviet Union or the Czarist empire. Russia has a law
against inciting ethnic hatred. But in Borovichi, where there are
about 500 Jews, and other rural areas, Jews worry that authorities
are doing too little to implement it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Borovichi represents the new Russian anti-Semitism _
anti-Semitism in the vast regions of Russia that grows unchecked by
national or international governmental institutions,'' Yosef
Abramowitz, president of the New York-based Union of Councils on
Soviet Jewry, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Alexeyev has appealed to local authorities for help. But
Borovichi's prosecutor last week refused to bring charges against
RNE, saying that the party itself is not illegal and that the
swastikas that its members wear do not incite ethnic hatred. The
local legislature has tried to ban RNE from displaying fascist
logos. Meanwhile, the posters and stickers keep appearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are afraid,'' Alexeyev said. ``They tell us: `Don't
forget that you're Jews, don't be too loud. You know who you're up
against.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Alexeyev, who is married with two small children, says he is not
afraid. But he is cautious about criticizing Borovichi. He does not
want to harm his relationship with its mayor, Vladimir Ogontsov.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when another neo-fascist group ran television ads
telling Christians to take up arms and ``kill a Jew a week,''
Ogontsov had the ads stopped.
</P>
<P>
   During Hanukkah in December, Borovichi officials helped put on
four sellout concerts of Jewish music. Officials also have offered
Alexeyev a building, for the price of $2,000, for a new synagogue
to replace the one destroyed by the Soviet authorities in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Alexeyev knows it could be worse. In Vladimir, a gritty
provincial center 120 miles east of Moscow, the governor still
flies the red Soviet flag and the regional legislature apparently
thinks anti-Semitism and Russian patriotism are the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are tolerated here as long as we keep quiet,'' Natalya
Itelson, 33, a leader of Vladimir's 700-member Jewish community.
She spoke from the Tractory Factory club there, one of the two
buildings in town where ``Jews feel safe about getting together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not live to see the day when Jews in Vladimir are seen
as ordinary Russian citizens,'' Itelson said.
</P>
<P>
   She became convinced of this after the past fall's barrage of
bluntly anti-Semitic outbursts in Moscow by leaders of the
Communist Party, which dominates the federal parliament. Prominent
Communist lawmaker Viktor Ilyukhin in November accused Jews of
waging ``genocide'' on Russians, and argued that the country's
population was falling because President Boris N. Yeltsin's
government was made up ``exclusively of one group, the Jews.''
(Yeltsin's governments have included some Jews and other
minorities.) Another lawmaker proposed quotas for Jews in
government, and Vladimir's local legislature voted 34-2 to support
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Then in December, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said he had
nothing against Jews but that what he called Zionists were plotting
to rule the world. Russian Jews, he said, had to choose which group
they belonged to.
</P>
<P>
   The outbursts were shocking but familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why have they brought this up now? Elections are coming'' this
December, ``and the Communists need an enemy,'' said Alexander
Osovtsov, executive vice president of the Moscow-based Russian
Jewish Congress. ``Whenever that happens in Russia, the first
candidate is the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Is anti-Semitism an effective electoral strategy in Russia? The
voters are certainly out there. In a recent survey of 3,000
listeners by Ekho Moskvy radio, 34 percent said ``yes'' to the
question: ``Would Russia be a better place if all the Jews left?''
</P>
<P>
   Sociologist Lev Gudkov, who studies anti-Semitism in Russia,
says both the Communists and ultranationalist groups such as RNE
are vying for similar voters: the estimated 20 to 25 percent of
Russians who harbor anti-Semitic attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone approves of politicians who employ anti-Semitism.
Moscow's mayor, Yury M. Luzhkov, has condemned the attacks and
banned RNE from holding a congress in Moscow. Yeltsin has ordered
his administration to combat political extremism.
</P>
<P>
   Jews generally report less tension in Moscow and St. Petersburg,
home to most of Russia's Jewish population. Few Jewish leaders in
Moscow think a return to state-sponsored anti-Semitism is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a different view in the regions where Communists
and their nationalist allies constitute the main political force
and Moscow's laws carry little weight.
</P>
<P>
   In Krasnodar Territory in southern Russia, RNE last month put up
posters calling on citizens to burn down Jews' houses. Krasnodar's
governor, Nikolai Kondratenko, frequently demands the ouster of
so-called Zionists from his region. Recently, Kondratenko has
introduced a textbook for Krasnodar schools that blames Russia's
problems in the 20th century on a Jewish conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Stavropol, a large RNE poster welcomes visitors with
an appeal for help in defending ``Russian order.'' When RNE wanted
to hold a congress here, they were given the main exhibition hall.
Black-shirted gangs harass Jews and warn of reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's frightening to go out on the street,'' said
Fima Fainer, head of Stavropol's small Jewish community. ``People
are starting to worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Although that worry has translated into only a slight increase
in Jewish emigration from Russia, Osovtsov of the Russian Jewish
Congress said, the number of Jews who want to know what they need
to do to leave has doubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jews leave, it is not a Jewish problem, it is a threat to
the idea of a democratic Russian state,'' Osovtsov said.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish leaders say the federal authorities have to act more
decisively in prosecuting hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are worried about the lack of action. . . . This sends
the wrong signal to regional authorities,'' said Adolf Shayevich,
the chief rabbi of Russia. ``The big danger for Russia is if these
people realize they can get away with anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, there are many Jews in business and government,''
Shayevich said. ``But there is fear because the government can't
control the situation. Perhaps some people have started to fear all
this fascist literature. Jews have a genetic memory and they know
where that leads.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ After 25 years of teaching women-only classes at Boston
College, Mary Daly, a renowned radical feminist philosopher with a
history of sparking controversy, received an ultimatum from college
administrators: Accept male students or stop teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Daly has balked _ and the ensuing debate, with liberals and
conservatives arguing the merits of allowing segregated classes,
may become the most vivid chapter yet in her career.
</P>
<P>
   A college spokesman says Daly has violated federal law and
school policy during most of her tenure, but it has become an issue
only recently, after two male students complained that Daly barred
them from her class.
</P>
<P>
   Daly, a tenacious, spirited woman, believes the university is
using the issue to ``get rid of her.'' Backed by scores of
students, and the support of many feminists who are slowly finding
out about it, Daly vows to fight the Jesuit college.
</P>
<P>
   ``After beginning my career there with a bang, I cannot end with
a whimper,'' said Daly, who is 70.
</P>
<P>
   She has rejected a retirement package, but hasn't decided her
course of action. She and her attorney, Gretchen Van Ness,
acknowledge they are facing a formidable foe.
</P>
<P>
   One of the students who asserts discrimination, senior Duane
Naquin, has the backing of the Center For Individual Rights, the
conservative Washington, D.C., law firm that successfully sued to
end race-based preferences at public universities in Texas and is
suing Michigan on similar grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In October, administrators received a letter from Naquin's
attorney at the center threatening to sue, and it prompted
officials to reconsider Daly's insistence on teaching men and women
separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston College's opinion is that she is violating federal law
and is thereby discriminating against male students to whom she is
denying access,'' said college spokesman Jack Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   Naquin declined to comment on his complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of allowing Naquin to take her class during this
semester, Daly decided to take a leave of absence. She says she
knew he was affiliated with a conservative group on a campus and he
didn't have the prerequisite.
</P>
<P>
   She hoped to return after the controversy subsided. In 1989,
after several male students challenged Daly's women-only policy,
she took a leave for a semester and the issue faded away.
</P>
<P>
   ``BC has wronged me and my students by caving into right-wing
pressure and depriving me of my right to teach freely,'' Daly said.
``This is not about discrimination. . . . This is about leveling
the rights of women and minorities so that white male power
reigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly is a renowned ``radical-feminist'' theologian and
philosopher, a pioneer in the field. The term radical, which Daly
says has lost its real meaning in contemporary use, refers to
getting ``at the root'' of what is wrong with society.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamental to her philosophy is the belief that since all
established religions are patriarchal, they are philosophically and
morally bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   She has written seven major radical feminist books that explore
world-wide atrocities against women and avenues of expression for
women's creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Among the books she has written are: ``The Church and the Second
Sex;'' ``Beyond God the Father,'' which is used as a text in
theology, philosophy, and women's studies classes in universities
throughout the world; ``Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical
Feminism'' and most recently ``Quintessence . . . Realizing the
Archaic Future: A Radical Elemental Feminist Manifesto.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, the college spokesman, said Daly offers a unique
perspective that all students _ including men _ should be able to
experience in a regular classroom.
</P>
<P>
   But Daly argues she cannot effectively teach these courses with
men in the room because it creates a dynamic that inhibits women.
Not only do men misunderstand her concepts _ because men cannot
understand what it's like to be a woman _ but they tend to be
disruptive, believing they are similarly oppressed, she says. These
kinds of disrupting influences ``dumbs down'' the class, she
insists, keeping it from ``soaring.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, she says, because society teaches women to nurse men, any
male student in the class who argues or says he doesn't understand
would end up becoming a center of attention, zapping creative
energy from the rest of the students.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Daly says, she has taught many male students by
offering one-on-one independent study classes. If anything, she
argues, the male students get more of her attention.
</P>
<P>
   When she first started teaching at Boston College, in 1966, she
taught all-male classes because women were denied entry to the
College of Arts and Sciences. In 1969, when Daly applied for tenure
and was denied, 1,500 students, all men, marched on campus to
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 30 years later, it's the women on campus leading the fight.
Fourteen students signed a letter sent to college administrators
two weeks ago expressing their dismay.
</P>
<P>
   One of the students who signed the letter, Megan Niziol, a
senior majoring in international studies, said Daly's voice is
being silenced and charged that the administration has handled the
issue awkwardly, giving no explanation to students who hoped to
take her class.
</P>
<P>
   Niziol says the issue has divided the campus, with many students
saying if the situation were reversed and a male professor tried to
keep women out, he'd be immediately fired.
</P>
<P>
   To that, Niziol says, ``We live in a patriarchal society in
which eliminating womens' access to education has been a method to
keep them oppressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who support Daly see a danger in allowing the Center for
Individual Rights to pressure Daly into retiring. A CIR letter sent
to hundreds of supporters nationwide seeking financial support said
the CIR plans to attack ``two of feminism's sacred cows: the
Violence Against Women Act of 1994 and Title IX of the 1972
Education Amendments.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Pell, a spokesman for the CIR, said he cannot comment
on any case without a client's permission, but said it's clear that
Boston College is in violation of Title IX and discriminates
against men.

 Drug resistance found in common infection
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Germs that cause garden-variety bladder infections in women are
increasingly resistant to the antibiotics that doctors commonly
prescribe to cure them.
</P>
<P>
   A study published Wednesday in the Journal of the American
Medical Association found that resistance to
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (brand names Bactrim and Septra)
doubled between 1992 and 1996 among 4,000 Seattle women with
bladder infections.
</P>
<P>
   Resistance to these main-line drugs rose from 8 to 16 percent
during the five-year period. That is close to the 20 percent that
specialists say should signal doctors to stop using a particular
drug, for fear it will drive a community's resistance rates higher.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kalpana Gupta of the University of Washington and her
colleagues warn that Bactrim and Septra ``may not be acceptable
choices. . . for much longer.'' The study was paid for by the
National Institutes of Health and the drug manufacturer Procter &AMP;
Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   One implication, Gupta said in an interview, is that a woman
should ask her doctor to ``culture'' her urine if she does not get
better on a first-line drug. Only then can the doctor know which
drug to try next.
</P>
<P>
   Other drugs remain effective, Gupta said. One, nitrofurantoin,
may require seven days of therapy to cure the infections, compared
to only three days for the current front-line drugs. Another,
ciprofloxacin, is effective in short doses, but the researchers
warned that increased use will merely promote microbial resistance
to it, too.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are part of a global problem. ``This is the decade
of multidrug resistance,'' Dr. Stuart B. Levy of Tufts University
School of Medicine warns in testimony to a US Senate committee.
``Resistant infections are four to 10 times as expensive to treat.
. . and US healthcare purchasers are paying the price.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Disparity examined in heart failure deaths
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans are twice as likely to die of heart failure as
whites, but researchers have long debated whether that reflects
differences in access to care, greater likelihood that blacks have
other complicating diseases, or some underlying racial
predisposition.
</P>
<P>
   A study in the current New England Journal of Medicine points to
a racial disparity. Analyzing 2,600 patients who participated in a
federally funded study designed to prevent heart failure, plus
4,200 others in a sister study to treat the disease, researchers
found that blacks were 25 to 36 percent more likely to die after
all factors were accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel L. Dries of the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute and his colleagues call for more research on heart
failure in blacks to see if different treatments are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another new study in the same journal pins down a
different, and also much-debated, racial and sexual disparity in
heart disease treatment.
</P>
<P>
   To see if doctors are more inclined to diagnose and treat
suspected heart disease more aggressively in white men than others,
Dr. Kevin Schulman of Georgetown University and his colleagues
presented 720 physicians with videotaped interviews of actors
portraying patients of different ages, genders, and races _ but
with the same chest pain symptoms and risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors were much less likely to order cardiac
catheterization, the definitive test for clogged coronary arteries,
for women and blacks. Black women were only 40 percent as likely to
be sent to the cath lab.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Birth timing, place tied to schizophrenia
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Having a mother, father, or sibling with schizophrenia raises
the likelihood that an individual will develop this common,
devastating mental illness. But so does being born in February or
March, or in an urban rather than rural area, according to a Danish
study of nearly 2,700 schizophrenia cases in the current New
England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The late-winter effect jibes with other studies suggesting that
flu virus infection during pregnancy may predispose a fetus to
schizophrenia later, said Dr. Francine Benes, a schizophrenia
researcher at McLean Hospital in Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   As for the urban factor, Benes said ``it raised the question in
my mind whether living in an urban center may be associated with
more stress. I'm convinced that part of what triggers this disease
in susceptible individuals is stress.''

KEEPING TABS ON THE NATION'S TOP PREDATOR 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ First, this bit of rudeness in the toniest part
of Pacific Heights. On Wednesday morning fliers appeared saying,
``Neighborhood Alert! Sexual predator headed our way.''
</P>
<P>
   The fliers referred to President Clinton's appearance at Gordon
and Ann Getty's home for a fund-raiser Thursday night. There's no
escape for the guy.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't scrawled notes. They were designed and nicely
typeset. Folks can afford it in the Gettys' neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the flier advertised Wednesday's
``Dateline'' interview with Juanita Broaddrick, the woman whose
accusations against Clinton even feminists can't ignore.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the flier, in very small type, were the words:
``But he's so GOOD on women's issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in San Francisco, Superior Court Judge Ernest Goldsmith has
a strange formula for justice: He sentenced the three people who
attacked Mayor Will Brown with pies to six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   That's extreme for an assault with tofu cream. I say that as a
columnist who condemned the attack as ugly and potentially
dangerous, and condemned the attackers for using the excuse that
they were doing it for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Six months? ``That's very harsh for that kind of a crime,'' said
Peter Keane, dean of the law school at Golden Gate University, and
a friend of Judge Goldsmith.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you or I got hit with a pie it would be considered
egregious if someone did a weekend in jail ... People have had
their noses broken and significant injuries, and people didn't do
anywhere near that.''
</P>
<P>
   This judge is either very crusty or very flaky.
</P>
<P>
   I did some research on newsworthy sentencings in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   A young man involved in the racially motivated gang beating of
two black couples and an infant in a San Francisco neighborhood got
a year in jail, of which he'd probably serve only six months
because of time served. And he used a chain, not a pie.
</P>
<P>
   Latrelle Sprewell got three months of home detention for
reckless driving on Interstate 680 when he swerved off an exit and
injured a couple in another car.
</P>
<P>
   A woman in Salinas, Calif., got six months in jail for running
up $8,000 worth of bills on other people's credit cards to buy
Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, weird crimes make the news. Now we have the weirdest
crime and punishment of all time, six months of hard time for soft
cream.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Goldsmith missed his chance to be the Solomon of
Sachertorte. Instead he created martyrs, and these people seemed to
want to be martyrs _ although perhaps not for six months.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect Solomonic sentence, of course, would have been six
months of community service baking pies for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Biotic Baking Brigade members showed no remorse,
there could have been an extra condition on the community service.
These vegetarians could have been ordered to bake the homeless meat
pies _ chicken pot pie, steak and kidney pie, shepherd's pie and
empanadas.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been more than just de(s)serts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The weirdest press kit ever arrived from the Business Software
Alliance, a trade group that fights software piracy and runs a hot
line so you can turn in your company or the guy in the next cubicle
for using unauthorized copies of software.
</P>
<P>
   The press kit is a clear plastic kids' school backpack, and it
arrived just as the group announced that five California companies,
including the Los Angeles Unified School District, settled software
piracy claims for $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, L.A. schools had to hand over to BSA money that
could have been used on education, and the BSA mailed the little
backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   What is the message here? The backpacks, appropriately enough,
were filled with play money, protractors and notebooks _ the kind
of school supplies you use if you can't afford computers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A radio station in New Zealand has rented hotel rooms in early
April for 100 couples to see which can concoct the first baby of
the millennium. April 9 has been named National Bonk Day in
Britain. Don't ask me how you tell who wins the contest if all the
clocks fail because of the year 2000 computer glitch.

COMPAQ'S ARMADA IS BRAWNY BUT FALLS SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKEL
 &HT;    c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Compaq Computer Corp.'s Armada 6500 is a laptop that lives up
to the name. With a huge 14.4-inch diagonal screen, a 6.4 gigabyte
hard drive, and a 300 mhz Pentium II microprocessor, this laptop
packs more power than most desktop computers. The notebook-sized
model packs nearly twice the power of my desktop machine, and at
$3,850, costs twice as much as a similarly equipped desktop
machine.
</P>
<P>
   The Armada 6500 is a slim computer _ just 1.3 inches deep _ but
it's screen is so large that it takes up too much space in your
briefcase or backpack. I was constantly being interrupted in cafes
and restaurants by people commenting on the large screen.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all its brawn, the Armada felt surprisingly sluggish and
unresponsive in day-to-day use. The reason, I suspect, it its hard
disk, which kept shutting down to save power while I was using it.
I had similar problems with the CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM rests in a little bay on the right side of the
system. Pull a switch and it shoots out. I wasn't careful the first
time I did this, and the drive ended up on the floor. You can slide
the floppy disk into the same bay, or slide in a small plastic
blank that will save a little weight and some drain on your
batteries. You can also buy a Zip drive for $275. I recommend the
Zip; it's excellent backup insurance while traveling with such an
ostentatious and expensive, machine. Don't keep your Zip disks in
the same bag.
</P>
<P>
   The Armada has stereo speakers and a large lithium-ion battery
that spans the width of the machine. Despite its size, though, I
got roughly two hours of life from the battery before it died on
me. A second battery will set you back $200.
</P>
<P>
   The Armada comes with a built-in Xircom modem/Ethernet PCMCIA
card. The machine ships with either Windows 95 or NT. For some
reason, the Win 95 version comes with network drivers for Novell
and Microsoft networking preinstalled, but TCP/IP is mysteriously
absent. Compaq claims the software is easily installed, and I
suppose it is, but shouldn't Compaq try to make things easier for
the typical customer?
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomically, I didn't really enjoy using the 6500. The keys
don't go down far enough. The buttons on the touch-pad hurt my
fingers when I pressed them. The system took an awfully long time _
sometimes up to a minute _ to wake up after being asleep.
</P>
<P>
   The Armada 6500 is a great status symbol, so I'm sure that a lot
of businesses will be buying these puppies for their top
executives. But if I had the option of buying one for myself, I
would probably pass.

MASSACHUSETTS CHECK POLICY LACKS SAFEGUARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Every year, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts issues
more than 1.5 million checks to pay for everything from salaries to
road salt to psychiatric drugs for state hospital patients.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, better than 98 percent of the checks are cashed. But
more than 12 years ago, to handle the several thousand that remain
outstanding at any given time, the state established an Unclaimed
Check Fund, an accounting device to create a cash reserve for
checks that might be cashed months late while moving them off other
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   At times it has held $42 million or more, money that was
supposed to be regularly transferred to the treasurer's heavily
publicized ``unclaimed money list'' for rightful owners to learn
about it and try to get paid.
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out the system has been grossly abused and ignored,
allowing a treasury employee to allegedly try to steal $6.5 million
from it and trade on insider information about the fund to reap
kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the system as designed had been honored, it appears
Massachusetts would have fallen well short of several other states
in trying to locate owners of uncashed state checks _ and keep
state funds from being stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that it took a criminal act to expose a
system that we now know needs significant overhaul,'' said Dwight
Robson, a spokesman for Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien. ``It is
apparent that a lot more work needs to be done before the technical
and managerial problems are fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   The main failing appears to be that under at least the last two
treasurers, Joseph D. Malone and Robert Q. Crane, the state never
widely publicized who held uncashed stae-issued checks. Also, since
1986 the treasury only sporadically _ and often with faulty
documentation _ transferred the money to the larger unclaimed money
list where its existence would become public. The unclaimed money
list normally accumulates $90 million annually from abandoned bank
and investment accounts and other private sources.
</P>
<P>
   Until last December, according to sources familiar with the
process, Malone's office would release a list of outstanding checks
worth only under $5,000 to bounty hunters commonly called ``heir
finders'' who requested it under the state's public records act.
(Heir finders make money by contacting the check owners and
offering to get them payment in exchange for keeping part of it as
a fee.)
</P>
<P>
   One heir finder who requested the list said Wednesday he was
told Malone's office did it that way because it was unsure of the
accuracy of the data, and ``if they're going to make a mistake,
they're going to make a mistake for less than $5,000.'' The Malone
aides involved were not available Wednesday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   However, that policy _ which was not formally changed until Dec.
3 _ apparently allowed the official overseeing the fund, John
Trischitta, to tip off an heir-finder accomplice named Martin
Robbins about big checks outstanding, allegedly in exchange for
kickbacks, according to investigators probing the case.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new policy, developed last May under pressure from at
least one heir finder who complained about the arbitrary manner in
which the fund approved and paid claims, the treasury began
releasing to people who requested it a complete list of checks
outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   It also attempted to put in safeguards on releasing the money,
requiring heir finders to provide a notarized power-of-attorney
form to prove they represented the individual or company who was
due the money. In addition, they had to show a photocopy of the
individual's driver's license or Social Security card, or for a
business, its letterhead and taxpayer identification number form.
</P>
<P>
   When an agency of state government needs to pay a check, it puts
in a request to the state comptroller through the Massachusetts
Management Accounting and Reporting System.
</P>
<P>
   This may be for a single big payment, or it could be an
aggregate amount covering a host of small checks going to, say,
injured employees receiving workers' compensation payments.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every workday, the comptroller combines the payment
requests on a computer tape and ships them to the state treasury,
which cuts the actual checks or authorizes wire transfers of money
from state accounts to individual or business bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Checks typically are paid from a ``pooled cash'' account held at
State Street Bank and Trust, Robson said. But each withdrawal is
attributed by the comptroller to the agency budget line item
covering the expense.
</P>
<P>
   For the huge amounts of money handled, the unclaimed check fund
seems to have had minimal oversight. Trischitta, the sole full-time
management employee overseeing the fund, apparently reported only
to Deputy Treasurer Robert E. Foley, and his assistant, Amelia
Viscomi, and was easily able to forge their signatures on paperwork
to release money.
</P>
<P>
   One question is why, if state checks are supposedly void unless
cashed within 90 days, the treasury even bothered to create the
fund. One approach the state could have taken would be simply to
refuse to pay checks cashed too late.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``If someone performs a service for us and the check
gets lost, our contracts don't say we're relieved of the legal
liability to pay you because you didn't cash the check in 90
days,'' said state comptroller Martin Beneson.
</P>
<P>
   It appears several states have stronger policies in place to
handle uncashed checks. For example, Missouri makes a list of all
unclaimed state-issued checks available to heir finders once a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri state checks are void 12 months after the date they are
issued. But if someone presents a check from the ``outlawed list''
later with adequate documentation, the state will reprint a check
for the amount owed, according to Jay Moore, banking division
director for state treasurer Bob Holden.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, state comptroller H. Carl McCall Jr. four years ago
instituted an aggressive policy of sending as many as three letters
to owners of uncashed checks, starting 6 to 9 months after a check
was issued. The letters urge recipients to either redeem the checks
or ask his office for help getting a lost check replaced, said
spokeswoman Theresa Bourgeois.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state makes checks void after 180 days, and leaves
with the individual agency the responsibility for tracking down
people who failed to cash checks, treasury spokeswoman Donna
Lawrence-Kennedy said.

NEW ADOBE PRODUCTS TAKE THE DRUDGERY OUT OF WEB IMAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this year, an old friend dropped me a note about my Web
page. He was amused by the relatively simple typography and the
gray background. ``Are you intentionally going for that retro
look,'' he asked, ``or have you simply not had the time to update
the page in the past four years?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, alas, is a little of both.
</P>
<P>
   Although I do take the time to update my Web page now and then,
Web technology is moving along at a much faster rate. Content was
king back when the Web was born, but these days style frequently
triumphs over substance. Perhaps its time for me to get with the
program.
</P>
<P>
   The key to making compelling Web pages is the combination of
cute little images and cleverly crafted JavaScript. Designers use
the images to display buttons or knobs or navigation bars.
JavaScript, meanwhile, is the tiny programming language that make
the buttons change when you roll over them with your mouse or click
on them.
</P>
<P>
   Most sophisticated Web designers that I know create their pages
with a fairly Spartan set of tools. They write their own HTML and
JavaScript using a basic text editor, they create their images with
Adobe PhotoShop ($600), and if they care about how long an image
takes to load they run a specialty program like Debabalizer to
super-compress the image without sacrificing too much in the way of
quality. The reason that my Web pages lag behind is that I never
had the time, or the desire, to master many of these tools.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Adobe Systems released two new image manipulation
programs that are designed to make it easier to put out
professional-looking Web pages: ImageStyler ($130) and ImageReady
($190). Both programs combine the look-and-feel of the popular
PhotoShop (and probably much of its technology as well) into
packages that are significantly easier to use, although
substantially more limited. Both products run on either Mac or PC
-- it's the same price for either version, but the programs come on
different CD-ROMs, so be sure to get the on you need.
</P>
<P>
   ImageStyler is a special-purpose tool for building banners,
buttons, navigation bars, complex image maps, or entire graphical
Web pages. What makes this program easy-to-use is the fact that it
is object-oriented. You start by creating a blank Web page and
adding images, text, and shapes. You can then modify the property
of each object, changing its color, typestyle, or special effects.
Finally, you can integrate this with JavaScript, so that images and
text change shape when you roll over them, click them, or release
the mouse. This is a lot easier than using Adobe PhotoShop because
it operates on images at the pixel level, it doesn't keep together
images that combine into a single Web page, and it doesn't know a
thing about JavaScript.
</P>
<P>
   When you are done designing your navigation bar or complex page,
ImageStyler exports it as an HTML file (complete with embedded
JavaScript) and a collection of images. Overall, the HTML is pretty
good -- it even has comments! You can then either insert this HTML
into your Web pages or include it automatically using HTML Frames.
</P>
<P>
   If you make a lot of Web pages that have buttons, ImageStyler
can save you a lot of work. But if you are just doing a few pages,
you might be better off with a more comprehensive product like
Adobe's PageMill. Finally, if you are cheap, take a look at
Microsoft's FrontPage Express, which comes for free with Internet
Explorer 4. You can use both PageMill and FrontPage to create many
(but not all) of the image maps and navigation bars that you can
with ImageStyler. The pages won't look as professional and whizzy,
but you'll save money. There are also a bunch of shareware programs
out there for making Web buttons. Unfortunately, most of these
programs require that you register them in order to use them
properly, and registration usually ends up costing half as much as
ImageStyler does -- for products that aren't nearly as functional.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe ImageReady is designed for the person who is cranking out
a lot of images for the Web and needs each one to be perfect. The
program lets you quickly touch up images, change the color balance,
crop, paint, compress them, and do other simple manipulations. Then
you can preview the result, finding out not only how it will look,
but how many seconds the image will take to download over a modem
of a given speed. You can also have ImageReady make a tiny scripted
application that will repeatedly apply your set of manipulations to
any file that is dragged on top of the application's icon.
</P>
<P>
   This is really handy if you have a few thousand images that need
to be shrunk, compressed, and color-balanced all in exactly the
same way.
</P>
<P>
   ImageReady allows you to work with multiple layers. You can pick
colors and area-fill. You can sharpen, blur, and stamp text -- even
text that is anti-aliased. And it can use any PhotoShop plug-in.
Indeed, ImageReady incorporates so many features from Adobe
PhotoShop that I would be hard-pressed at this point to recommend
the more expensive program for anyone who is not a graphic artist.
</P>
<P>
   What I like best about both ImageStyler and ImageReady is that
they fairly easy-to-use programs that do one job and do it well.
They are also extremely polished, thanks, to that common code that
they share with Adobe PhotoShop 5.0. With these programs, PageMill,
and Acrobat, Adobe continues to reinforce its dominance in the
graphics and multi-media authoring arena.
</P>
<P>
   The only product that's missing is a system for building Web
sites that integrate with database systems. Perhaps we'll see such
a program later this year.

`200 CIGARETTES' IS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An ensemble cast united by a single event or place has long been
a mainstay in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Though Robert Altman and Alan Rudolph made the notion
commonplace in films such as ``Nashville'' and ``Welcome to L.A.,''
the concept dates as far back as 1932 with Edmund Goulding's
star-studded ``Grand Hotel.'' It's taken many turns since then _
from 1964's ``The Yellow Rolls Royce'' to just about every disaster
epic made in the 1960s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the indie film world has embraced the idea of a taxi cab
as the thread that links stories and characters together in such
offbeat fare as ``After Hours,'' ``Night On Earth'' and ``Chicago
Cab.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the idea has pretty much worn itself out, ``200
Cigarettes'' is, oddly enough, fresh air in a stale genre. It
features a top-notch cast of young talent and it actually recreates
with some success the arty allure of New York's trendy Lower East
Side.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1981 and New Year's Eve. A party is about to take place in
a downtown loft belonging to Monica (Martha Plimpton), who broke up
with artist boyfriend Eric (Brian McCardie) six months earlier. But
Brian isn't moping around. He's dating Bridget (Nicole Parker).
Bridget and her best friend Caitlyn (Angela Featherstone) have
agreed to attend the party with him, but Bridget's a little miffed
that Eric's just told her that Monica is his ex and she seizes the
opportunity to make the moves on the handsome bartender (Ben
Affleck) who is serving the trio some pre-function cocktails at a
downtown bar.
</P>
<P>
   Add two ``Jersey girls,'' underage friends Val (Christina Ricci)
and Stephie (Gaby Hoffmann), who are hoping to sneak into the bash,
as well as good pals Lucy (Courtney Love) and heartbroken Kevin
(Paul Rudd), woefully lamenting the demise of his relationship with
performance artist Ellie (Janeane Garofalo), and a new couple,
sweet, clumsy Cindy (Kate Hudson) and conceited Jack (Jay Mohr),
and the air is ripe with possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Blend in a jive-talking taxi driver, played by Dave Chapelle,
who drives the characters to their appointed destinies and anything
can _ and does _ happen.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the fun is discovering who will end up with whom by the
end of this goofy affair. And though there are several
all-too-familiar plot contrivances, first time feature film
director Risa Bramon Garcia manages to keep the action moving and
the silly lines light and appealing. She is aided immensely by the
charming Affleck, Plimpton and the scene-stealing Garofalo.
</P>
<P>
   Who could resist a come on as awful as Affleck's when he finally
realizes he's scored with two women at once: ``How do you like your
eggs in the morning? Scrambled or fertilized?'' The preview
audience howled at such dreadful stuff, but then no one ever said
the '80s were known for good taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``200 Cigarettes'' is energetic and nearly quaint despite its
eccentricity. Although it's essentially just a puff of smoke that
evaporates once we're out of the theater, it still engages and
entertains because of a terrific cast.
</P>
<P>
   200 Cigarettes. Directed by Risa Bramon Garcia. Written by Shana
Larsen. Cast: Ben Affleck, Dave Chapelle, Janeane Garofalo, Kate
Hudson, Courtney Love, Jay Mohr, Nicole Parker, Martha Plimpton,
Paul Rudd, Christina Ricci. Paramount Pictures. 96 minutes. Rated R
for language, sexual content.

SORDID `EIGHT MILLIMETER' APPEALS TO BASEST INSTINCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joel Schumacher's new mystery-thriller, ``Eight Millimeter,''
could well have the distinction of being the most thoroughly sordid
and depressing Hollywood big-studio film of the '90s. It gives a
whole new meaning to the word ``downer.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the director's other work (``Lost Boys,'' ``The Client,''
the last two ``Batman'' movies), it's slick and fast-paced, with
the most expensive-looking production values Hollywood has to offer
and mostly competent performances.
</P>
<P>
   But also like those films, it's numbingly vacuous at its core,
and _ despite its sanctimonious tone and ``serious'' subject matter
_ it's basically an exploitation film that's out to shock,
titillate and appeal to the absolute worst in its audience.
</P>
<P>
   The story is about an upscale private-eye (Nicolas Cage) hired
by the widow of an industrial czar to track down the makers of an
8mm film she's found in her late husband's private safe showing a
teenage girl being savagely murdered for some sicko's viewing
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   It seems an impossible task, but in no time at all he's found
the victim's family, and cornered the committee of monsters who
created the ``snuff'' film, but not before he himself comes into
great peril _ both psychological and physical.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, we're treated to a relentless journey into the
dark side of Schumacher's imagination: S&AMP;M bars, kiddy-porn
emporiums, numerous glimpses of movies that depict people being
bound and tortured, and young women butchered for a sexual kick.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Hardcore,'' ``Cruising'' and other big-budget studio
films that have dealt with the S&AMP;M world, the sensibility here is
highly conservative. Its message is that sex is evil, and the end
product of sexual freedom is not fulfillment but murder. Step out
of line and you become Ted Bundy.
</P>
<P>
   If you like that message, you may find the film a more profound
exploration of human nature than I did. But even if you do, you'll
still likely to find it amazingly hypocritical, and uncomfortably
designed not just to shock, but to excite.
</P>
<P>
   As a genre thriller, you're also likely to find it a fairly
incompetent exercise that constantly relies on a series of amazing
coincidences, that seems implausible every step of the way and
finally disintegrates into a bad horror movie, ``Friday the 13th,
Part X.''
</P>
<P>
   The film has been given the generic ``R'' rating by the MPAA,
which brings up a disturbing question: how could a movie that shows
frontal nudity, masturbation, oral sex, bondage and graphic S&AMP;M,
and refers to bestiality, child pornography and toilet sex,
possibly not earn an NC-17 rating?
</P>
<P>
   At the film's preview earlier this week, I actually saw several
families with pre-teen children happily watching this crash course
in abnormal sexuality. Why does Hollywood even bother to go through
the pretense of having a rating system if it has no intention of
using it?
</P>
<P>
   Eight Millimeter. Directed by Joel Schumacher. Written by Andrew
Kevin Walker. Cast: Nicolas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix, James
Gandolfini, Catherine Keener, Peter Stormare. Columbia. 123
minutes. Rated R for nudity, S&AMP;M sex scenes and extremely graphic
violence.

AT THIS SITE, EVERYONE'S A POET; COOL THINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his preface to ``Leaves of Grass,'' Walt Whitman declared,
``The United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem.''
No doubt, that great champion of democracy would have sung the song
of the Internet. Now there's a Web site, www.favoritepoem.org, that
proves that poetry in cyberspace is not a contradiction in terms.
</P>
<P>
   We're not just talking about printed text, static words on a
screen. We're talking about a Roxbury minister reciting Longfellow
and recalling a time when the news of his death was greatly
exaggerated. We're talking about a native of Alaska reading a poem
that pulled her through a long winter's depression. We're talking
about human connection of the most intimate _ albeit technological
_ kind.
</P>
<P>
   Launched last Sunday, the site is the on-line extension of poet
laureate Robert Pinsky's Favorite Poem Project. Pinsky, a Boston
University professor, started the project in 1997, and it was
decidedly low-tech at first. He planned to have a former student
wander around Washington, asking tourists to read poems into a
portable tape recorder. Good ideas have a way of growing, though,
and within a year, folks from all over were sending Pinsky their
favorite poems, which will be archived at the Library of Congress
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Pinsky sponsored poetry events in five cities,
including Boston. Ordinary citizens shared the podium with
politicians and other public figures: homemakers and homeless
citizens, choreographers and corporate executives were united
through meter and verse. And now their voices can be heard by
millions via streaming audio and video.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want, put it this way, to reach a wide net,'' Pinsky said
the other day. ``Poetry is a bodily act; it's also intellectual and
emotional, but it involves a voice that comes out of a body. The
Web makes it possible to hear in the voice the nature of the
attachment between the person and the poem.''
</P>
<P>
   The monitor serves as a sort of electronic salon. Listen to
Bridgit Stearns reciting ``Not Waving But Drowning'' by Stevie
Smith, explaining how the poem illustrated her depression. It also
inspired hope. ``It has a little bit of a tone of defiance and
bravery and a chirpiness. . . . It encouraged me to keep thrashing
and to keep waving. It helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   Watch Bill T. Jones, that philosopher of dance, choreograph his
favorite poem on the small screen of your media player. See

   ``None of them are the artist. None of them are the expert,''
Pinsky says. ``Yet they take the risk of saying `I love this poem.'
This phenomenon has to do with community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site brings poetic pictures to the masses, creating what
Pinsky calls ``a large-scale time capsule.'' Years from now, you'll
be able to hear the voice of Rev. Michael E. Haynes, the Roxbury
minister who designed his gravestone while awaiting surgery back in
1989. He survived, but the cemetery mistakenly put the gravestone
on his plot, and for a while folks whispered about his death. That
marker is inscribed with his favorite poem, Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow's ``A Psalm of Life.'' This couplet sums up the spirit
of the site: ``And departing, leave behind us / Footsteps in the
sands of time.''

   Pinsky is a people's poet; Andrew Collins, on the other hand, is
a pop-culture junkie. Director of creative content at
Thingworld.com, he ``drives traffic and commerce opportunities in
unique ways through compelling digital content.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: He makes cool stuff.
</P>
<P>
   And what exactly does he make? Well, things called Things. In
ad-speak, Things are ``memorable, interactive, and surprising user
experiences optimized for today's bandwidth.'' In the words of
Collins, they ``allow brand owners a tamperproof way to leverage
their assets on line.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Things are cool. They're also marketing tools.
</P>
<P>
   A Thing is an interactive screen image that changes when you
click on it with your mouse. Here's an example from the Comedy
Central Web site: See Chef Aid from ``South Park.'' Put your mouse
on the image, and he talks: ``Hello there, children.'' Click, and
he sings: ``I'm gonna make love to you, woman.'' Things are digital
tchotchkes, electronic ephemera. Fans can download them and put
them on their own home pages, but they have a built-in link back to
Comedy Central's site.
</P>
<P>
   Newton-based Thingworld.com recently won ``Innovation of the
Year'' from the folks at ``Cool Site of the Day.'' In addition to
Comedy Central, Thingworld.com has developed electronic nifties for
the New England Patriots and the World Wrestling Federation; Hasbro
Toys and Curious George; David Bowie and Nintendo's Zelda.
</P>
<P>
   The technology allows media moguls to spread their copyright
images among fans while maintaining a link to their own domains.
``If you shut out your fan base, you're doing yourself a huge
disservice,'' Collins says.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, 30, knows he fits the stereotype of an interactive
media guy. As a pop-culture junkie, he's his own best customer. ``I
sort of ooze into the room on this job, and people think, `Oh,
here's a goofy fan.' '' A pause. ``Isn't it cool?''

<P>
   The United States, as Zbigniew Brzezinski once said, will be the
first, last and only global superpower.
</P>
<P>
   American officials quite naturally tend to act as if the world
were unipolar. They boast of American power and American virtue,
hailing the United States as a benevolent hegemon. They lecture
other countries on the universal validity of American principles,
practices and institutions.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1997 G-7 summit in Denver, President Clinton boasted
about the success of the American economy as a model for others.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright has called the United
States ``the indispensable nation'' and said that ``we stand tall
and hence see further than other nations.''
</P>
<P>
   This statement is true in the narrow sense that the United
States is an indispensable participant in any effort to tackle
major global problems. It is false in also implying that other
nations are dispensable _ the United States needs the cooperation
of some major countries in handling any issue _ and that American
indispensability is the source of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union,
the United States was often able to impose its will on other
countries. That unipolar moment has passed. The two principal tools
of coercion that the United States now attempts to use are economic
sanctions and military intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions work, however, only when other countries also support
them, and that is decreasingly the case. Hence, the United States
either applies them unilaterally to the detriment of its economic
interests and its relations with its allies, or it does not enforce
them, in which case they become symbols of American weakness.
</P>
<P>
   At relatively low cost, the United States can launch bombing or
cruise missile attacks against its enemies. By themselves, however,
such actions achieve little.
</P>
<P>
   More serious military interventions have to meet three
conditions: They have to be legitimated through some international
organization, such as the United Nations where they are subject to
Russian, Chinese or French veto; they also require the
participation of allied forces, which may or may not be
forthcoming; and they have to involve no American casualties and
virtually no ``collateral'' casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the United States meets all three conditions, it risks
stirring up not only criticism at home but widespread political and
popular backlash abroad.
</P>
<P>
   American officials seem peculiarly blind to the fact that often
the more the United States attacks a foreign leader, the more his
popularity soars among his countrymen who applaud him for standing
tall against the greatest power on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The demonizing of leaders has so far failed to shorten their
tenure in power, from Fidel Castro (who has survived eight American
presidents) to Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein. Indeed, the
best way for a dictator of a small country to prolong his tenure in
power may be to provoke the United States into denouncing him as
the leader of a ``rogue regime'' and a threat to global peace.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Clinton administration nor Congress nor the public
is willing to pay the costs and accept the risks of unilateral
global leadership. Some advocates of American leadership argue for
increasing defense expenditures by 50 percent, but that is a
nonstarter. The American public clearly sees no need to expend
effort and resources to achieve American hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   However much foreign policy elites may ignore or deplore it, the
United States lacks the domestic political base to create a
unipolar world. American leaders repeatedly make threats, promise
action and fail to deliver. The result is a foreign policy of
``rhetoric and retreat'' and a growing reputation as a ``hollow
hegemon.''
</P>
<P>
   In acting as if this were a unipolar world, the United States is
also becoming increasingly alone in the world. American leaders
constantly claim to be speaking on behalf of ``the international
community.''
</P>
<P>
   But whom do they have in mind? China? Russia? India? Pakistan?
Iran? The Arab world? The Association of Southeast Asian Nations?
Africa? Latin America? France? Do any of these countries or regions
see the United States as the spokesman for a community of which
they are a part?
</P>
<P>
   The community for which the United States speaks includes, at
best, its Anglo-Saxon cousins (Britain, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand) on most issues, Germany and some smaller European
democracies on many issues, Israel on some Middle Eastern questions
and Japan on the implementation of U.N. resolutions. These are
important states, but they fall far short of being the global
international community.
</P>
<P>
   On issue after issue, the United States has found itself
increasingly alone, with one or a few partners, opposing most of
the rest of the world's states and peoples. These issues include
U.N. dues; the land mines treaty; global warming; an international
war crimes tribunal; the Middle East; the use of force against Iraq
and Yugoslavia; and sanctions against Cuba, Iran, Iraq and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   On these and other issues, much of the international community
is on one side and the United States is on the other. The circle of
governments who see their interests coinciding with American
interests is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States regularly denounces various countries as
``rogue states,'' in the eyes of many countries it is becoming the
rogue superpower.
</P>
<P>
   If a unipolar world were unavoidable, many countries might
prefer the United States as the hegemon. But this is mostly because
it is distant from them and hence unlikely to attempt to acquire
any of their territory.
</P>
<P>
   American power is also valued by the secondary regional states
as a constraint on the dominance of other major regional states.
Benign hegemony, however, is in the eye of the hegemon.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reads about the world's desire for American leadership
only in the United States,'' one British diplomat observed.
``Everywhere else one reads about American arrogance and
unilateralism.''
</P>
<P>
   Political and intellectual leaders in most countries strongly
resist the prospect of a unipolar world and favor the emergence of
true multipolarity.
</P>
<P>
   At a 1997 Harvard conference, scholars reported that the elites
of countries comprising at least two-thirds of the world's people _
Chinese, Russians, Indians, Arabs, Muslims and Africans _ see the
United States as the single greatest external threat to their
societies.
</P>
<P>
   They do not regard America as a military threat but as a menace
to their integrity, autonomy, prosperity and freedom of action.
They view the United States as intrusive, interventionist,
exploitative, unilateralist, hegemonic, hypocritical and applying
double standards, engaging in what they label ``financial
imperialism'' and ``intellectual colonialism,'' with a foreign
policy driven overwhelmingly by domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Such reactions are to be expected. American leaders believe that
the world's business is their business. Other countries believe
that what happens in their part of the world is their business, not
America's, and quite explicitly respond.
</P>
<P>
   As Nelson Mandela said, his country rejects another state's
having ``the arrogance to tell us where we should go or which
countries should be our friends. ... We cannot accept that a state
assumes the role of the world's policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   In a bipolar world, many countries welcomed the United States as
their protector against the other superpower. In today's world, in
contrast, the world's only superpower is automatically a threat to
other major powers.
</P>
<P>
   It would behoove Americans to stop acting and talking as if this
were a unipolar world. It is not. To deal with any major global
issue, the United States needs the cooperation of at least some
major powers. Unilateral sanctions and interventions are recipes
for foreign policy disasters.
</P>
<P>
   American leaders also should abandon the benign-hegemon illusion
that a natural congruity exists between their interests and values
and those of the rest of the world. It does not. At times, American
actions may promote public goods and serve more widely accepted
ends. But often they will not, in part because of the unique
moralistic component in American policy.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also simply because America is the only superpower,
and hence its interests necessarily differ from those of other
countries. This makes America unique _ but certainly not benign in
the eyes of those countries.

REVOLUTION FINALLY TASTE A TOURNAMENT WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIRANDOLA, Italy _ The Revolution had to travel far from
Foxborough to win a tournament for the first time. Actually, the
Torneo Cesare Ragazzi should not be considered an event of great
significance, with three mini-games of 40 minutes each, but any
accomplishment will suffice for the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition included two teams from divisions even lower than
the Serie C teams the Revolution have been facing _ and will meet
Friday in Modena. Still, the Revolution edged Concordiese, 1-0, on
a 27th-minute free kick by Imad Baba, then played a 0-0 tie with
the home team, Mirandolese, to clinch first place. Concordiese
defeated Mirandolese, 2-1, in between.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Zenga filled only the coach's role of his player-coach
duties and made key substitutions in the opening match. A starting
lineup of mostly reserve players began strong but soon faltered
against Concordiese. Baba, Mike Burns, Jair, Joe-Max Moore, and
Giovanni Savarese entered in the 25th minute and the Revolution
surrendered a shot off the side of the net seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   But Edwin Gorter moved from defense into midfield, and Baba
converted with an impressive free kick that swerved into the far
left side of the net from 25 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Mirandolese was reinforced by retired Serie A midfielders
Giuseppe Accardi and Carlo Trevisanello. Though neither player had
been training, they displayed a savvy and touch that kept their
team in contention, even against a Revolution team that was
physically superior.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution needed at least a tie to clinch first place, and
the back four _ Burns, Dan Calichman, Richard Goulooze, and Ted
Chronopolous _ had a take-no-prisoners approach to the contest.
This game involved the prospective starting lineup for the
Revolution, which could also include John Harkes, after his loan to
Nottingham Forest expires next month. They performed like a team
that will think defense first and be difficult to maneuver against.
But the offense lacked a finishing touch. Baba drilled the
Revolution's best chance off the top of the bar in the eighth
minute, and No. 3 goalkeeper Anthony Latronica stopped
Mirandolese's best chance from Accardi in the 32d minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``These games do not mean too much,'' Zenga said. ``You can
sometimes win playing badly, or lose playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Revolution players felt a sense of accomplishment,
especially after last year's disastrous record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to win a tournament,'' defender Manny Motajo said.
``This is something we can build on.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ian Feuer, starting goalkeeper for the Revolution last year, was
traded to Colorado for future considerations. Feuer expressed his
desire to leave the Revolution after Zenga announced he would be
playing this year and had been performing on loan in England.

<P>
   Col. Qaddafi's emissary, Youssef Debri, met me in Cairo. He was
in Egypt exploring the ramifications of Libya's surrendering two of
its citizens to stand trial for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight
103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   In formal talks in New York, a U.N. official had already managed
to narrow the gap between Libya's concerns and the British-American
proposal for a trial in the Netherlands, but important differences
remained.
</P>
<P>
   Now Debri was in Cairo informally, to clarify Washington's terms
with a well-connected, retired American diplomat, in the hope of
ending Qaddafi's equivocation.
</P>
<P>
   An intimate of Qaddafi since their student days at military
college, Debri had contacted me some weeks before to propose that I
visit Libya. Cut off from the world by the U.N. embargo over
Lockerbie, Libya, he said, had grown weary of its isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the embargo's terms, it could sell oil _ its only export _
to European customers, so it had money for food and medicines. But
the other barriers to trade and transportation were wearing it
down. Few businessmen and almost no journalists came to call.
</P>
<P>
   Debri's message was that Libya, anxious for a new start, wanted
to put Lockerbie behind it. In Libya, he assured me, I would be
free to go where I liked and to see whomever I wanted, including
Qaddafi himself.
</P>
<P>
   Having decided on the journey, I went to the State Department
for a briefing. Officials there acknowledged that they knew little
about what was going on in Libya. In 1986, two years before
Lockerbie, President Reagan broke off relations with Libya and
imposed economic sanctions in response to a series of terrorist
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the officials said, Libya had committed
no terrorist acts. Unlike Iraq, it posed no strategic threat. But
because of Lockerbie, the United States still shunned Qaddafi and
kept Libya on its list of terrorist states.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a U.S. grand jury indicted two Libyans _ Lamin Khalifa
Fhimah, ex-manager of the Libyan Arab Airlines office in Malta, and
Abdel Basset Ali al- Megrahi, a high-level intelligence official _
for the Lockerbie bombing. A British court did the same. In 1992,
the U.N. Security Council imposed its own sanctions, including a
flight ban that effectively closed Libya's airports. Tripoli, in
response, proposed trying the two suspects in a neutral country,
but Washington and London would have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last August, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright
announced that she would ``call the Libyan government's bluff'' and
offered a trial by a Scottish court seated in the Netherlands.
Libya agreed in principle, but Qaddafi demanded more details.
</P>
<P>
   The American embargo did not bar my visit (since it makes an
exception for journalists). I flew to Cairo; then, with Youssef
Debri, set off for Tripoli by car.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped at Benghazi, then Sirte, chosen by Qaddafi as Libya's
new capital. Around 11 o'clock on the morning after our arrival,
Youssef and I set out, heading south, to see Qaddafi.
</P>
<P>
   After a half-hour ride across the desert, we were met by a
police escort, which led us to an almost indiscernible dirt track
that ran off the paved road. A bumpy mile or so later, we reached
the gate of a chainlink fence, where three or four limousines sat.
</P>
<P>
   Parking our car among them, we piled into a Land Rover, which
bucked us over rock and sand a half-hour deeper into the desert.
Finally, we reached an encampment of large tents and modern
trailers near which grazed a herd of some 200 camels. No armed
guards seemed to be anywhere in view.
</P>
<P>
   The tent to which I was first directed was ballroom-size, its
sides open to admit the breeze. Seated next to three Africans in
native robes, I was offered tea.
</P>
<P>
   The Africans made a brief call on Qaddafi, after which Youssef
escorted me to Qaddafi's tent, pitched nearby, and left me there.
Save for a few simple chairs and a table, the tent was bare. Its
camel-skin roof and sides were weathered; the rugs covering the
sand floor were ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Qaddafi sat alone, except for an interpreter. He wore a thin,
tattered Bedouin robe, embroidered at the edges, over a
much-laundered print sport shirt and khaki pants. His furrowed face
was clean-shaven, his eyes covered by dark glasses. A beige turban
half-concealed his bushy hair.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I began the interview by asking whether the view that Libya had
embarked on a new course was correct.
</P>
<P>
   Qaddafi did not turn to me to answer. Through the open flaps of
the tent, he fixed his eyes on the horizon. His lips seemed barely
to move. He spoke in a controlled monotone, though from time to
time emotion quickened its pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``America,'' he said, ``unfortunately treats us as if the world
was the way it used to be. Americans accept that changes have taken
place since the end of communism, but not in their treatment of
Libya. So in the end, they take a racist and fanatical position,
similar to the way Hitler treated the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that America is much like Hitler. We have no
explanation for this, except that it is a religious, fanatical,
racist position. Some analysts call this a new colonialism. But
colonialism is colonialism, and it is always unjust. It is how we
were treated by the Italians, Algeria by the French, India by the
British. This is imperialism, and we seem to be entering a new
imperialist era.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cause of our conflict with America is not that we attacked
them. We have never attacked an American target. America started
the aggression against us right here in the Gulf of Sirte. When we
defended ourselves, they attacked us in these very tents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were bombed by missiles in our own territorial waters. In
1986 our own children were killed. No one can bring my daughter
back to me. Then Lockerbie came along. Now we'd like this chain of
events to be over. But America doesn't want to turn the page. We
shall, however, show courage and be patient, and America will be
the loser.''
</P>
<P>
   The events about which Qaddafi rambled date back to 1981, when
American jets shot down two Libyan planes in a dispute over the
extent of Libya's territorial waters. In January 1986, President
Reagan, responding to terrorist attacks in Rome and Vienna, blocked
commerce with Libya and froze its American assets. A few weeks
later, U.S. Navy planes bombed Sirte and destroyed four patrol
boats in another dispute over territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Reagan, blaming Libya for a bomb that killed two
American soldiers in a Berlin nightclub, attacked Tripoli and
Benghazi, along with suspected terrorist camps in the desert. Among
the 37 civilians reported killed was Qaddafi's adopted infant
daughter, Hana'a. Libyans say the child's death haunts him still.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Qaddafi if Libya was responsible for the many
terrorist incidents of which it was accused in the 1980s, he issued
no denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``These incidents that you mention belong to the past,'' he
said. ``Once Abu Amar (Yasir Arafat) was wanted. Now he enters the
White House with all the trappings, the music, the red carpet
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought I detected a note of envy in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say Libya is a terrorist country. But now that is
illogical, not reasonable. All these things are of the past, an era
that is over. The bombing of the French plane (a French UTA
airliner bombed over Niger in 1989, at a cost of 171 lives) took
place during a time of war in the region _ Libya, Chad, France. It
was similar to America's downing of the Iranian plane in the gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis shot down a Libyan aircraft over the Sinai. The
Soviet Union shot down a Korean airplane. It was a time of war. So
how come you forgot all about that and you just mention the charges
against Libya? There is no explanation for that. We go back to the
racist, fanatical complexes of America.''
</P>
<P>
   When I suggested to Qaddafi that the downing of the other
airliners might have been the result of miscommunications, he broke
into derisive laughter. But I persisted, asking whether the UTA and
Lockerbie bombings were not deliberate efforts to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at your logic, the American logic. Those who use missiles
or fighter planes and rockets are legitimate. Those who use
explosives or small bombs are considered terrorists. If we use the
same logic, Osama bin Ladin will use cruise missiles, the same
weapon used by America, and he will not be accused of being a
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we were responsible for bringing down the French plane
will be decided by a French court. We don't say anything about it.
The same is true of Lockerbie. I can't answer as to whether Libya
was responsible. Let's let the court decide. Libya has not been
convicted of any terrorist act up to this moment. If they accuse
us, they have to prove their charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Was terrorism, I asked, ever in Libya's national interest?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you ask me that? Why don't you ask why it is in
America's interest to attack us in the Gulf of Sirte, why it is in
America's interest to kill our children? Is it so unusual for Libya
to have a reaction when these things happen? Who is being unfair?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no interest in being hostile to America. We would be
fools to initiate a confrontation with America. But when you face
aggression, you have to defend yourself, no matter how small you
are. We want a reconciliation with America, but America doesn't
want a reconciliation with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Libya, I asked, ready to turn over the two Lockerbie suspects
for trial? His answer, I thought, contained a clue to his
procrastination in resolving the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have agreed that a trial should take place. Now let us sit
down and decide how it can be put into practice. I want to find out
the truth about Lockerbie myself. After that, the story will be
finished. I am not so concerned about whether the two Libyans are
convicted or not. What is important is that the problem come to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twice the number of Libyans have died from the embargo than
were killed at Lockerbie. Whether this one or that is guilty or not
is the business of the lawyers and the courts. What matters is that
once the trial starts, sanctions will be over against Libya. The
embargo will be lifted.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on, pessimistically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, normal relations between our two countries should
be restored. But I am sure that because of America's psychological
complexes and imperialist designs, such normal relations will not
be restored, even if the Lockerbie business is over. America wants
to occupy the Gulf of Sirte and the north of Africa. It wants to
hand over Egypt and Syria to Israel, so that a Greater Israel is
established.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problems with the West generally. Libya has good
relations with Europe. We have European embassies and companies
here. But America is different. We are not enemies of the American
people. Millions of Arabs, millions of Muslims, millions of
Africans are Americans these days. How could we be their enemy?
Only imperialist policies prevent our working together. Libya is a
victim of American terrorism.''
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later I was cautiously sipping camel milk in the
waiting-tent when Youssef returned. In an urgent tone he reported,
``The Leader wants me to remind you that he was not talking
officially and that he was not stating policy. He asks you to
remember that he is a private person and was speaking from his
heart on what he feels.''

 &HT;    Sonia is 12 and blind; not surprisingly, she has never played
with footballs, but from age six she was forced to stitch them,
eight hours a day, seven days a week. Her dainty, deft fingers
would often pierce her tiny hands with the needle as she pieced
together tough bits of leather.
 &HT;    But the child taught herself never to yelp in pain for fear of
losing employment, which would have threatened her family's
survival. Yet at the end of each day, she had not earned enough to
buy even a loaf of bread.
 &HT;    Still, Sonia was one of the lucky ones. Kailash Satyarthi, who
has been fighting child labor for the last two decades, raided the
factory _ media in tow _ where she and many other children worked.
After a tough fight through headlines that embarrassed the football
manufacturer, Mayor and Co., Sonia was given back her childhood.
She now lives in the state Vocational Rehabilitation Center for the
Blind in Ludhiana, Punjab.
 &HT;    Kailash, who is 44, has seen many such misery-ridden Sonias
through to happy endings, yet he is no invincible hero. In fact,
the crusade he has launched against child servitude in South Asia
has seen him coping with as many disheartening defeats as
victories.
 &HT;    ``How can I gloat over little triumphs when I see so many
children being wasted as overworked and underpaid help at squalid
factories, dingy shops and affluent urban homes every single day of
my life? When I know that parents still give children away at brick
kilns to work as bonded laborers as repayment of debt?''
 Millions of Workers, Millions of Slaves  
 &HT;    Sikander was 17 when he joined the Delhi shelter after six years
of inhuman working conditions in a carpet factory in the Mirzapur
district in Uttar Pradesh. Forced from age 10 to support a widowed,
ailing mother and two younger siblings, Sikander toiled 12 hours a
day to keep starvation at bay.
 &HT;    ``I worked in tin sheds, which get terribly hot during summers.
Also'' _ and he winced as he recalled those times _ ``we were often
beaten if we made any mistakes.'' Then he was rescued by Kailash's
network, and he is now training to become a welder.
 &HT;    Of the estimated 140 million working children in India, nearly
half are, in effect, slaves. Poverty-stricken parents who need
paltry sums of money _ sometimes just for basic sustenance _ borrow
from moneylenders and literally sign away their livelihoods
forever.
 &HT;    ``There is just too much of this around for us to feel content
about our work,'' Kailash said. ``A problem of such a large scale,
I have come to believe, has to be fought strategically: Raids,
rescue and rehabilitation have to go hand in hand with engineering
national and international aversion and support against child
labor.''
 &HT;    This is the philosophy that Kailash practices, that has spurred
him and his organization, the South Asian Coalition Against Child
Servitude, to identify and liberate more than 34,000 children
working in industries across India, where grimy little hands
working to fight hunger are an accepted reality. Even the upwardly
mobile middle-class thinks little of employing young children to
prepare their morning cuppa because such domestic help is plentiful
and cheap.
 &HT;    And parents in the poverty-ridden rural pockets are often forced
to barter their children to repay debts that keep death away.
 The Economics of Bonded Labor  
 &HT;    Many companies fight to keep child laborers at work because to
the manufacturers, it makes good economic sense. Factories making
carpets, sporting goods, firecrackers, bangles and brassware prefer
smaller hands to do the intricate work especially because children
do not demand better working conditions or more pay.
 &HT;    There are also criminal elements who conspire to control the
network of children in servitude and thwart the laws that ban
employment of youngsters. As a result, no employer has ever been
punished for violating a 1986 act that prohibits employing children
in the carpet industry, a sector defined as hazardous. Frequently,
employers of child labor shield their enterprises by posing as
family concerns.
 &HT;    Kailash has attacked this evil despite the many powerful
interests that resist any change that could damage profit margins.
 &HT;    He also recognized that the rescued children need
rehabilitation, and in 1991, he established the Mukti Ashram
(Shelter for the Liberated) in Delhi, which is run by volunteers.
He has also established 14 informal education centers, which are
funded by such international agencies as Bread for the World,
Christian Aid, Terre des Hommes and Miserior.
 &HT;    The first shelter found Kailash knocking on doors _ literally _
with requests for donations. ``I guess because the initiation of
the shelter saw ordinary people personally involving themselves in
the cause by giving it their hard-earned money,'' he said, ``the
project has always been run at a personal level: Each child is
special to us. Before we train them in a vocation, we make sure
there is a need for such skills in their village. If the locality
has no tailors or is short on a radio repairer, then that's the
skill we prepare the child for. Along with education, of course.''
 Escape Through Education
 &HT;    At Mukti Ashram, the children get basic training in literacy,
health and social issues. Those over 14 get vocational training in
such trades as carpentry, tailoring and making cane and bamboo
products. There are group discussions on the legal system and
children's rights, as well as current political issues. The
youngsters also help manage the ashram, thus acquiring leadership
skills.
 &HT;    Once the children return to their villages, the ashram keeps
track of how they fare. Many become economically independent,
setting up small enterprises. Most importantly, these rehabilitated
youngsters are helping to teach their communities to fight for
their rights in order to prevent further bondage.
 &HT;    Some of the youngsters return to help Kailash in the
raid-and-rescue operations. Thirteen-year-old Mohan, from Bihar
state, was rescued from a carpet factory in Uttar Pradesh, where he
had worked from age seven to 10. After a year in the Mukti Ashram
in New Delhi, it became clear that he was a bright youngster, and
Kailash enrolled him in one of the marches against child labor.
After this Mohan returned to his village and gave talks in local
schools about the cruel realities of child labor.
 &HT;    Fourteen-year-old Govind is doing the same. An underpaid
telephone booth attendant during the day and a cook at night for a
shopkeeper in the Nepal-Sikkim border town Jhaba, the boy was
rescued by Kailash's activists about three years ago. Once at the
shelter, Govind impressed everyone by his quick mind and grasp of
academic subjects, so he was encouraged to be part of all the
coalition's rallies and marches.
 &HT;    He returned from a three-week visit to his village near Jhaba
and informed Kailash about the local networks that he has set up
there. He went to each family in his village and informed them of
the poor conditions their children work in once they are sent away
to the bigger cities.
 &HT;    ``He is so fired up by what he has learnt here,'' Kailash said,
``that he now plans to go to different villages in India and talk
of his experiences as a child who had to work 16 hours a day. My
children are all so bright. They are going to change society.'' He
calls them ``young multipliers of the message.''
 &HT;    Through the Coalition, which was founded in 1989, Kailash has
supplemented these individual rescue operations with a vigorous
campaign to garner public opinion against child labor. Today The
South Asian Coalition Against Child Servitude comprises 400 partner
organizations, including human rights groups and trade unions in
Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka.
 &HT;    ``The need for comrades in the combat was obvious,'' he said.
``I realized that children in the region were all facing the same
pernicious fate, and that the fight had to be for all of them.
Banning child labor in India would only shift businesses that
thrive on such inexpensive labor to the neighboring countries.
These children are ours, you cannot shun their problems because
they don't share your nationality.''
 &HT;    Every wall in Kailash's small, functional office in South Delhi
seems to reflect this belief. Huge black and white photographs of
children from South Asian countries who are working away their
childhood crowd the office, reminders that millions will have to
join hands to save the millions suffering.
 &HT;    He points at them and says, ``Children are world citizens and
the world must come together to save them.''
 &HT;    It was this global outlook that brought Kailash to push through
a carpet-consumers' awareness campaign that culminated in the
creation of Rugmark, a label that certifies carpets made without
child labor. To be Rugmark-certified, carpet manufacturers agree to
independent monitoring and inspections. A presentation by Kailash
in 1991 before a U.N. human rights subcommission in Geneva resulted
in U.N. endorsement of the label.
 The Power of a Positive Label 
 &HT;    He is unwilling to hazard a guess on the percentage of carpet
manufacturers who comply with the Rugmark requirements, but he
points out that Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Britain and the
United States import only Rugmark carpets from the Subcontinent.
The certification is not foolproof, of course.
 &HT;    James Tufenkian, an American who is on the board of Rugmark and
whose company employs about 6,000 weavers in Nepal, was quoted in
The New York Times last October as saying, ``While Rugmark's heart
is 100 percent in the right place, how can we know what's really
going on in the weavers' homes?''
 &HT;    Added to these advocacy efforts, Kailash has organized many
marches in India and Nepal as part of an ongoing protest against
child labor. His latest effort saw him co-ordinating a Global March
Against Child labor this year. Commencing in January 1998, the
march saw activists, supporters and many a child laborer march in
Asia, Africa, America, Australia and Europe and many of them
traveled to Geneva in June for the drafting of a new convention on
child labor by the International labor Organization.
 &HT;    ``Marches have been so much a part of the Indian tradition of
protest,'' Kailash says. ``Mahatma Gandhi used marches effectively
to protest British laws.'' Kailash also wrote 800 letters to
organize different groups for the March to Geneva.
 &HT;    Gauri Pradhan, of NGO Child Workers in Nepal, credits Kailash
with having made the cause a regional rather than a
country-specific issue; Ishtiaque Ahmed, who works against child
labor in Dhaka, Bangladesh, credits Kailash with perseverance and
vision.
 &HT;    Not that Kailash is hungering for appreciation; he is quite
prepared to meet any criticism that might come his way and advances
some himself: ``People might say we have no business touring the
world when the problem of child labor is nowhere near eradication
back home. But that's a very narrow approach. In today's globalized
world you can't sort out anything by remaining home.''
 An Early Start  
 &HT;    Kailash's first brush with child labor was close to home in a
small town in Madhya Pradesh. Perplexed to see the cobbler's son
not attending school like him, 7-year-old Kailash innocently asked
why, only to be told that children born to the ``untouchable''
castes in India have no option but to work.
 &HT;    The sentence stuck with him. So did the desire to change the
terrible truth of the statement.
 &HT;    Years later, while studying electrical engineering at the
Regional Engineering School in Vidisha, Madhya Pradesh state, where
he was born, he organized a book bank to help those students who
could not afford new textbooks.
 &HT;    After teaching engineering for a few years Kailash decided to
work more directly for social change. ``The world had to know the
shocking truth. And I chose not to remain with a mainstream
profession but to change things. I walked out of home.'' Now,
others walk with him, in his marches against the sale of childhood.

 FROM: Wired  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    What a trick of fate: The way to get ahead in the age of the
knowledge worker is not through raw brainpower, but by harnessing
your emotions.
 &HT;    Daniel Goleman, a Harvard-trained psychologist and former New
York Times science writer, turned this idea into a household phrase
with his 1995 blockbuster ``Emotional Intelligence.'' A primer on
the art _ and science _ of self-mastery and social persuasion, the
book remains an international best-seller, now translated into 30
or so languages. At the time of this interview it was topping the
charts in Turkey.
 &HT;    Goleman's follow-up volume _ ``Working with Emotional
Intelligence'' (Bantam, 1998) _ goes even further, providing a kind
of moral philosophy for corporate America. His thesis: In today's
technical fields, you need a highly developed set of soft
(emotional) skills to leverage your hard (knowledge-based)
expertise.
 &HT;    Now CEO of the consulting firm Emotional Intelligence Services
(www.eisglobal.com/), Goleman seems to be walking the talk; let him
know what you think at goleman javanet.com.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    JEFF GREENWALD: The mythical hero of Silicon Valley is the nerd
_ a brain trapped inside a geeky-looking body. Your research
suggests otherwise.
 &HT;    DANIEL GOLEMAN: The stereotype of the tech expert with no social
skills may be accurate. And I used to think these two factors were
independent. But friends at places like MIT argue that people drawn
into the technical fields spend many hours _ particularly in
adolescence _ alone, absorbed at the computer, or in a lab.
 &HT;    As they're increasing their technical understanding in math and
science, they're missing out on a parallel track of social
learning. They become emotionally de-skilled, and that pulls them
back later in their careers.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: The person who seems to belie this point of view is Bill
Gates, who by external appearances is almost autistic. He's hardly
what anyone would call a failure.
 &HT;    A: Gates is a fascinating case. He has a fabulous drive to
achieve, and that reverberates throughout his company. On the other
hand, he's notorious for the worst of emotional intelligence. He
yells, he's abrasive, and he doesn't seem to care how he's coming
off. If he were starting at the bottom _ if the playing field were
level for Gates _ he's not the guy you would pick to lead a team.
He'd work for you, not run you.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: So what's the role of technical skill?
 &HT;    A: It's an entry-level requirement. You have to have enough to
do the job _ but it's not what sets star performers apart. A
University of California/Berkeley study, started in the 1950s,
followed a group of Ph.D. students in science and the technical
fields for 40 years. It turned out emotional-intelligence abilities
were four times more important than IQ in determining professional
success and prestige by the end of their careers.
 &HT;    And in a study of managers who failed, it was always because of
a deficiency of emotional intelligence.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Does our penchant for smartcards, smart homes, and PDAs
encourage emotional intelligence in society, or impede it?
 &HT;    A: The early returns show a negative impact, particularly as it
affects kids _ the average level of emotional intelligence has been
declining among young people for the last 20 years. This generation
spends more time than any generation in history staring at video
monitors. It doesn't matter if they're doing educational CD-ROMs;
they're not out playing with other kids.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What about the workplace?
 &HT;    A: The increasing reliance on communication via the Web and
e-mail _ if it replaces human touchpoints _ weakens the fabric of
connectedness that makes a company or organization work. That's why
emotional intelligence is so important in the high tech universe.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: How does emotional intelligence apply to people like Oracle's
Larry Ellison who are more inspired by the Japanese ``warrior
mentality''?
 &HT;    A: Samurai were Zen students _ they engaged more skillfully
because they cultivated inner peace. Emotional intelligence is
about being skillful, not squishy.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What's today's most emotionally intelligent technology?
 &HT;    A: The MIT Media Lab's Roz Picard, who wrote a book about 2001's
HAL 9000, is investigating computers that can read emotions in the
user and adjust themselves accordingly. If you're frantic and
uptight, they can make things easier. If you're enthusiastic and
zeroed in, they'll up the level of challenge. They're user-friendly
in the real sense of the word _ which means they're emotionally
intelligent, for machines.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: It's one thing to program a computer; how about humans?
 &HT;    A: Competency in emotional intelligence is learnable. In
``Working with Emotional Intelligence,'' I set out guidelines for
training programs designed to make people better on the job, where
the payoff is. A lot of programs out there _ such as these one-day
motivational seminars, or doing ropes courses in the countryside _
have little, no, or even a negative effect. Companies are wasting a
lot of time and money on inappropriate solutions.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Could good training rescue a troubled company _ say, Apple?
 &HT;    A: Emotional intelligence is not the answer to every problem
faced by an organization. There are market realities. But how well
you face a market reality is determined by emotional intelligence.
Andy Grove, writing about Intel, makes a good point: The critical
thing is how managers respond emotionally to a crisis. So often
people panic, deny the crisis _ or kill the messenger. A company
has to be open to bad news, take it in fully, and respond quickly.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: What about other traditions that have a different way of
dealing with emotions?
 &HT;    A: In many Asian cultures you squelch expressions of emotion,
particularly of negative emotion _ which means that people are
getting eaten up inside without showing it. But I was amazed at
Asia's interest in emotional intelligence. In Taiwan, ``Emotional
Intelligence'' is the best-selling book of all time. In Korea,
they're starting to put emotional intelligence curricula in the
schools. ``We're very taken by the West,'' they told me, ``and very
influenced by your ideas and technologies. And here is Western
science affirming our most deeply held values.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Is emotional intelligence sort of bottom-line Buddhism?
 &HT;    A: It's very interesting. Buddhists read ``Emotional
Intelligence'' that way. Christians tell me it's about
Christianity. And Jews tell me it's a great book about Judaism. It
may in that way reflect what Huxley called ``the perennial
philosophy,'' which itself reflects the basic neurological
structures that govern human existence.
 &HT;    My work is grounded in science, particularly neurological
science. Apparently the eternal questions all the great religions
are grappling with are the legacy of evolution: What do you do with
destructive emotions? How can you live a good life, and have
healthy connections to other people? How can you help future
generations?

 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    What a trick of fate: The way to get ahead in the age of the
knowledge worker is not through raw brainpower, but by harnessing
your emotions.
 &HT;    Daniel Goleman, a Harvard-trained psychologist and former New
York Times science writer, turned this idea into a household phrase
with his 1995 blockbuster ``Emotional Intelligence.'' A primer on
the art _ and science _ of self-mastery and social persuasion, the
book remains an international best-seller, now translated into 30
or so languages. At the time of this interview it was topping the
charts in Turkey.
 &HT;    Goleman's follow-up volume _ ``Working with Emotional
Intelligence'' (Bantam, 1998) _ goes even further, providing a kind
of moral philosophy for corporate America. His thesis: In today's
technical fields, you need a highly developed set of soft
(emotional) skills to leverage your hard (knowledge-based)
expertise.
 &HT;    Now CEO of the consulting firm Emotional Intelligence Services
(www.eisglobal.com/), Goleman seems to be walking the talk; let him
know what you think at goleman javanet.com.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    JEFF GREENWALD: The mythical hero of Silicon Valley is the nerd
_ a brain trapped inside a geeky-looking body. Your research
suggests otherwise.
 &HT;    DANIEL GOLEMAN: The stereotype of the tech expert with no social
skills may be accurate. And I used to think these two factors were
independent. But friends at places like MIT argue that people drawn
into the technical fields spend many hours _ particularly in
adolescence _ alone, absorbed at the computer, or in a lab.
 &HT;    As they're increasing their technical understanding in math and
science, they're missing out on a parallel track of social
learning. They become emotionally de-skilled, and that pulls them
back later in their careers.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: The person who seems to belie this point of view is Bill
Gates, who by external appearances is almost autistic. He's hardly
what anyone would call a failure.

LURE OF THE MOUNTAINS IS STILL STRONG FOR THE TENTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH CONWAY, N.H. _ So much has been written about the 10th
Mountain Division ``Ski Troops'' of World War II that these white
cloaked soldiers on their white skis carrying white carbines have
become as romantic in lore as the elite air corps dogfighters of
the previous war.
</P>
<P>
   Many divisions in the Europe and Asian theaters fought longer,
under more prolonged battle conditions, and suffered more
casualties over time. Through the 54 years since the war ended,
many of those divisions have remained in touch, vowing not to let
the memories that bound their lives together, fade.
</P>
<P>
   But the 10th Mountain Division _ known simply as ``The Tenth'' _
has another dimmension binding them, one that will bring them
togehter yet again this weekend at Mt. Cranmore during the Hannes
Schneider Meister Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our love of the outdoors,'' says Newc Eldrege, an Enfield
New Hampshire native and veteran of the Tenth. ``We love to ski and
hike and climb in the mountains. Sure there was the crucible of
combat, but there was much more than that that has held us
together.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, says Eldrege who had just played tennis with
90-year-old Tenth vet John Hubner on Wednesday, ``guys from a lot
of other divisions that fought far longer than we did get ticked
off because we get so much publicity _ and I don't blame them.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995 when Eldrege and his friends climbed up Riva Ridge
in Italy in a 50th anniversary reenactment of the most famous Tenth
battle scene and there, on the summit, embraced their former
enemies, it was clear that the love of the mountains made a greater
bond than the combat that once enveloped them.
</P>
<P>
   The International Federation of Mountain Soldiers, says Eldrege,
who led a squad on the front lines the night the Tenth won the
battle of Riva Ridge, includes fighting units from Germany and
Austria as well as England, France, and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So it is more than old war memories that keep veterans of the
Tenth coming back to events like the Meister Cup, which this year
coincides with the 60th anniversary of the Cranmore Mountain
resort. A lifelong devotion to skiing still keeps the now 70- and
80-year-olds coming back to race on the mountain whose history is
entwined with early years of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the ski area opened in the Mt. Washington Valley,
a young ski instructor from Austria _ Hannes Schneider _ who was
fleeing the Nazis, took a job as ski school instructor. With much
pomp and ceremony, Schneider and his 17-year-old son, Herbert,
arrived in North Conway by train, and were given a hero's welcome
at the station.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Schneider began a trend that found many European ski
instructors teaching the new sport that was catching on in this
country. His Arlberg training technique was the first uniform
method of ski instruction, and Schneider for all time will be
remembered as ``the father of modern skiing.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the European expatriates who fought in the Tenth
founded ski areas and schools from New England to the Rockies
(Aspen and Vail) in a post-war decade that established skiing as a
broad middle-class sport in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our numbers are shrinking,'' says Eldrege, who will be racing
on one of three teams, each with five Tenth veterans to compete
this weekend. ``We used to get 300, and now we're down to about 100
at this reunion.''
</P>
<P>
   But for those who will race over the weekend, skiing is still a
serious pursuit. ``Most of us have kept at it because it's
something we love,'' says Eldrege, noting that the modernization of
equipment _ most notably shaped skis _ have made it easier for the
aging soldier/skiers to make their turns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volante made a Tenth special edition shaped ski,'' he says,
``and they are wonderful. They carve well, and give great control.
They really make skiing easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``old soldiers' race'' is just one feature of the Meister
Cup, which also includes NASTAR handicapped speed competitions for
various age groups ranging from 13 to 80. Races, demonstrations,
special events, and a banquet are all part of the weekend in North
Conway.
</P>
<P>
   All proceeds raised will benefit the New England Ski Museum and
the Make-A-Wish Foundation of New Hampshire, which is devoted to
fulfilling wishes for children faced with life-threatening
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the draw for the Tenth veterans is simply the
opportunity to get together are reminisce. ``We don't bother too
much with the facts,'' says Eldrege, who remembers that several of
the veterans met in the spring of 1995 for the 50th anniversary
reenactment.
</P>
<P>
   Dispatched to Italy in the spring of 1945, the Tenth encountered
elite German mountain troops firmly anchored atop Riva Ridge on the
1,200-foot rock ledge of Mt. Belvedere that commanded the Po
Valley, a possible entrance point for an enemy advance. The nearly
vertical face of Belvedere was considered unclimbable.
</P>
<P>
   But on an April night, some 800 Tenth soldiers climbed Belvedere
and then even engineered a tram car on the mountain to evacuate
wounded. They engaged the surprised Germans, overunning one
stronghold after another until they had dirven the enemy so far
back the Allied troops were able to cross the Po River. On May 2,
the war in Italy ended with the German surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people tell this and make it sound like the Tenth
guys think they won the war,'' says Eldrege, ``and the publicity we
get outweighs what we did in comparison to some other divisions,
like the 5th and the British 8th.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the veterans did their reenactment climb in 1995,
and met with former enemy soldiers to admire the beauty of the
country they once fought over, their message was clear to all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germans, Swiss, US . . . we all worked to create a trail for
people who love to climb and hike in those mountains. Our mission
has been to make peace trails out of the battle mountains, and to
pass (the message) of peace and human rights onto future
generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all,'' says Eldrege, ``we're not going to be around a
hell of a lot longer.''

INOFFENSIVE `OTHER SISTER' IS PLEASANT ENOUGH DIVERSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does this sound like a bad idea or what? A comedy-drama (with
the emphasis on comedy) about a family coping with the return of
their mentally handicapped daughter after (heh, heh) several years
in an institution, directed by low-humor specialist Garry Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   You can recall past Marshall epics and almost see the movie,
can't you? Perhaps an uneasy combination of the medical hijinks of
``Young Doctors in Love,'' the dysfunctional family fun of
``Nothing in Common,'' the sappiness of ``Beaches'' and the
wholesale false sincerity of ``Dear God.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. ``The Other Sister'' is no masterpiece and definitely has
its share of wincing moments, but it's an incorrigibly
sweet-spirited affair that gradually finds a pleasing middle ground
between an affliction-of-the-week weepie and a rollicking domestic
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The story is about the Tate family: wealthy dentist father (Tom
Skerritt), meddling mother (Diane Keaton), and three grown
daughters, one of whom _ the 24-year-old Carla (Juliette Lewis) _
has just returned to the bosom of her family after a lengthy tenure
in a boarding school for the retarded.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the already guilt-ridden mom is instantly
overprotective of Carla, and the film works off the tension that
arises in the family as she moves out from under that maternal
protection, finds an apartment of her own and falls in love with an
equally mentally handicapped young man (Giovanni Ribisi).
</P>
<P>
   With so much of the drama _ and humor _ of the piece designed to
come out of semi-slapsticky scenes in which Carla keeps doing
things that are horrendously embarrassing for the family, the whole
enterprise constantly totters on the edge of a descent into the
worst kind of bad-taste black comedy imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, it doesn't happen. And much of the credit for this
has to go to Lewis, who doesn't have to stretch her normal goofy
mannerisms very far to convince us she's authentically handicapped.
She creates a genuinely believable character (in the way Helena
Bonham Carter did not in her recent affliction role, ``The Theory
of Flight'').
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the ensemble is almost as strong. Tom Skerritt has
rarely been so winning as he is playing an endlessly patient man
whose meekness masks a profound love for his disabled daughter; and
Diane Keaton is wonderfully exasperating as a mother struggling
between protecting and controlling an especially vulnerable child.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Marshall has admirably restrained his usual
penchant for broad comedy and crude sexual innuendo to let a more
subtle humor and groundswell of family affection emerge from his
characters and situations. ``The Other Sister'' is too long and
never quite comes together to be anything truly special, but it's
inoffensive, reasonably entertaining, very much its own thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Other Sister. Directed by Garry Marshall. Written by
Marshall and Bob Bruner. Cast: Juliette Lewis, Diane Keaton, Tom
Skerritt, Giovanni Ribisi, Poppy Montgomery, Hector Elizondo,
Joanna Going. Touchstone/Disney. 130 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some
sexual situations.

NBC'S `ALICE IN WONDERLAND' IS A LOVING TRIBUTE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Imagine Lewis Carroll pitching ``Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland'' to a network executive in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll: ``The main character is a little girl who can grow
smaller or bigger by munching mushrooms or drinking magic
elixirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Executive: ``So it's about the '60s drug culture? NBC just did a
whole miniseries on the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll: ``No. It's a fantastical tale with characters like
Tweedledum, Tweedledee and the Queen of Hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Executive: ``Oh, it's about Diana and the royal family? You're
about a year late, pal.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll: ``No, no. It's a fictional story that pokes gentle fun
at adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Executive: ``A satire, huh? People don't get satire.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll: ``NO! It's just an illogical little yarn that doesn't
make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Executive: ``Well, why didn't you say so? Give me 22, no, 44
episodes and we'll put it on right after `Two Guys, a Girl and a
Pizza Place.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is our good fortune that Carroll dealt not in the offices of
Hollywood high-rises but in the tall imaginations of children (and
adults reluctant to grow up).
</P>
<P>
   Not that the story defies translation to the screen. Millions
who were kids in the '80s remember Irwin Allen's four-hour,
two-night telefilm on CBS that probably holds the record for
celebrity bloat. The cast included Steve Allen, Ernest Borgnine,
Beau Bridges, Lloyd Bridges, Red Buttons, Sid Caesar, Carol
Channing, Imogene Coca, Sammy Davis Jr., Patrick Duffy, George
Gobel, Steve Lawrence, Eydie Gorme, Merv Griffin, Sherman Hemsley,
Ann Jillian, Arte Johnson, Harvey Korman, Karl Malden, Roddy
McDowall, Jayne Meadows, Donna Mills, Pat Morita, Robert Morley,
Anthony Newley, Louis Nye, Donald O'Connor, Martha Raye, Telly
Savalas (as the Cheshire Cat), Ringo Starr, Sally Struthers, Jack
Warden, Jonathan Winters and Shelley Winters.
</P>
<P>
   There have been at least 11 other film treatments, including
five more on television, dating all the way back to 1903, which was
only five years after Carroll's death. No question, the story of
Alice's adventure after she followed White Rabbit down that hole is
enduring and endearing.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark Entertainment's three-hour film Sunday night on NBC is
no slouch, though in the celebrity department it's a featherweight
compared with Allen's.
</P>
<P>
   The scene stealers are Martin Short as a caffeinated Mad Hatter
and Miranda Richardson as Queen of Hearts, whose ear-splitting
rants are reminiscent of Judy Tenuta, sans accordion. It's a
wonderful encore for Short and Richardson, who stood out in Robert
Halmi Sr.'s Hallmark productin of ``Merlin'' last season.
</P>
<P>
   With Carroll's fabulous imagination and twice as many special
effects as were in ``Merlin,'' Halmi couldn't possibly go wrong,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Pretty much, except the first hour of ``Alice'' is a bit slow.
Tina Majorino ultimately makes it work, playing Alice with a mix of
bashfulness and bravado that's nearly as perfect as the sumptuous
visuals.
</P>
<P>
   For some children, ``Alice in Wonderland'' is more nightmare
than dream. But with warm lighting and no monstrous Jabberwock,
this one is as benign as they come. Alas, no Jabberwock means no
Jabberwocky. (Perhaps the network censors feared there's something
subversive in mysterious verse about ``slithy toves'' that ``gyre
and gimble in the wabe.'')
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there's precious little of Carroll's nonsense language
in this ``Alice,'' and several familiar characters are also
missing. Nonetheless, it is a lavish, loving tribute, and if it
sends many kids and their parents in search of the unabridged
version, the Cheshire Cat's grin will last a long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   Alice in Wonderland. Three-hour TV movie based on ``Alice's
Adventures in Wonderland'' and ``Through the Looking-Glass and What
Alice Found There,'' by Lewis Carroll. Starring Tina Majorino,
Robbie Coltrane, Whoopi Goldberg, Ben Kingsley, Christopher Lloyd,
Pete Postlethwaite, Miranda Richardson, Martin Short, Peter
Ustinov, George Wendt and Gene Wilder. Sunday on NBC. Parental
guideline rating: TV-PG.

DAFOE DESERVES BETTER

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON _ Byron Dafoe wouldn't classify himself as a
statistics nut but he does peruse the sports pages to see where he
ranks among National Hockey League goalies.
</P>
<P>
   If, during training camp, you'd have told the Bruins netminder
that at this point in the season he'd have a 2.12 goals-against
average (sixth in the league) and a .924 save percentage, he'd have
been a happy man. But what doesn't add up about Dafoe's numbers is
his 18-19-7 record, a mark that belies his other stats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite a funny stat,'' said Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe is tied for second in shutouts (six) with some pretty good
company _ Philadelphia's John Vanbiesbrouck and Phoenix's Nikolai
Khabibulin _ and tied for fourth in save percentage with Carolina's
Arturs Irbe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is discouraging,'' Dafoe said of his losing record. ``As
happy as I do feel about my goals against and save percentage, I'd
trade it in for where I was as far as wins last year. I'm ahead in
all categories from last year except for wins. Probably the most
frustrating thing is you can go out and feel you had a pretty good
game _ even Ottawa (a week ago when the Bruins lost, 2-0), you give
up two goals on 28 shots and that's generally a pretty good game _
but you walk away pretty disappointed because it's a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter how well you played because if you don't
win, it's not satisfying. That's the reality. You'd think sooner or
later, it would turn if you could keep those numbers where they are
because in the last two games, we've scored 11 goals. If we can do
that some more, the wins are going to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe, who was born in Great Britain but raised in Canada, said
it wasn't his lower number of wins that kept him off the World
All-Star team. At the time the roster was filled out, he had more
wins than Irbe. Dafoe said it was his understanding that he never
was considered at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard through the grapevine that they didn't even consider
me because I'm not truly European,'' said Dafoe. ``We're marketing
this game as World players against North Americans and you don't
fit so let's go with Irbe. That's what I heard. To be honest (that
explanation) makes sense because the numbers didn't make sense.
That disappoints me. Then put me on the North American ballot. As
long as next year it's cleared up.''

GIVE THE NEW GUY A CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ It's not his fault.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox fans are going to have to remind themselves that Jose
Offerman did not ask to become The Man Who Replaced Mo Vaughn. He
did not hold a gun to the head of Red Sox general manager Dan
Duquette and demand a four-year, $26 million contract. He did not
ask to take Mo's place at first base. And it's not Offerman's fault
that the Sox failed in their bids to acquire Bernie Williams,
Albert Belle, and other high-profile free agents this winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Offerman Era began Wednesday, and it's important to remember
all of the above. Let's resist our primal instincts and give the
guy a fair chance.
</P>
<P>
   Jose made his first appearance at Red Sox camp at 9:27 a.m.,
walking into the Sox minor league complex with a Kansas City Royals
equipment bag slung over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman walked up behind Boston manager Jimy Williams and said
hello. Williams, who had been talking with a Boston radio producer,
turned around and said, ``We were just talking about you, Jose.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of folks in the Sox camp have been talking about Offerman.
They talk about where he'll play _ first base, second base, or
designated hitter? They talk about him replacing Vaughn's ``on-base
capability.'' They talk about difficulties he had with former
Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda. They talk about how the pressure of
following Mo might get to the 30-year-old Dominican.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman won't have any of the Vaughn comparisons. Nor should
he.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people don't see me that way,'' he said. ``That wasn't
the situation. They don't got me because Mo leave the team. They
got me because they was looking for me. It's a lot different
between me and Mo, and I hope people don't compare me with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman is not going to hit home runs. He's hit 22 homers in
his career (including one off Dennis Martinez in his first big
league at-bat), never more than seven in a season. Last year he hit
.315 with a league-leading 13 triples and 45 stolen bases. He
played 152 games at second base and committed 19 errors. He's a
leadoff man who strikes out more than he walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what people expect from me,'' said the
switch-hitter. ``I just want to do my job. The only thing I can
bring is a guy that likes to play every day and do everything I can
do to help the team, and that's what I'm here for.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman gets on base and manufactures runs. Will that be enough
to satisfy bloodthirsty Boston fans?
</P>
<P>
   It might be rough. Stan Papi never got a fair shot in Boston
because he was traded for popular Bill Lee. Matt Young was hooted
out of town because fans felt he was overpaid and couldn't pitch
under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman already has been stung by Boston columnists and talk
show hosts. Movie star Samuel L. Jackson took a shot at him during
the ESPY Awards on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse is Offerman's reputation as a player who
doesn't like playing in big-market towns. He was more comfortable
in Kansas City than he was in Los Angeles. So how is he going to
handle the darts and arrows that find all athletes who play in
Boston?
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through that before,'' he said. ``I played in LA and it
was that way. Right now I'm in a better position because I'm older
and I can handle it a lot better than what I used to do before. It
would be a lot easier than last time.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor Jose. How do we tell him that nothing in his professional
baseball life has prepared him for the months and years ahead in
Boston? He hasn't played a game yet, but already he's a marked man
because of the contract and his status as The Man Who Followed Mo.
If he's anything less than Maury Wills, he's going to get roasted
in the Hub.
</P>
<P>
   Already there is controversy regarding where he'll play.
Offerman isn't going to remind anyone of Bill Mazeroski, but
Duquette makes it clear that he wants Offerman to play second base.
Williams loves Jeff Frye and doesn't feel Frye should lose his job
just because he blew out his knee last year. Offerman broke in as a
shortstop, but that won't be an option here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm willing to wait for them to put me in the
position they want me to play,'' he said. ``I'll just be ready for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing first, naturally, would only add to the pressure of
following Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want nobody to compare me with him,'' he said. ``I'm
too far away from him. I just try to do my job. The only difference
is if I have to play first. I don't try to do what he do, and
people have to understand that. I will try to do the best I can. It
is hard to say what I'm going to do, but I will try to do my
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman is from the Dominican Republic. His English is good,
but not as good as Pedro Martinez's. He will wear No. 30. He is 6
feet tall, weighs 190 pounds, and is married with two children.
</P>
<P>
   He is not Mo Vaughn, but that is not his fault. He is Jose
Offerman. Give the guy a chance.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ After 13 years, my husband still swears I was
trying to collect on his life insurance.
</P>
<P>
   I had roasted a pair of cornish game hens. Mine was fine, his,

   Then there's the woman who refrigerated vegetable soup in the

realized the soup had taken on a life of its own, her daughter had
eaten a bowl and gone off to soccer practice. They carried the
child off the field to an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   She should have placed the soup in glass or plastic containers
before refrigerating it.
</P>
<P>
   And there are questions I am frequently asked: ``Can I still use
this case of canned tomatoes I bought three years ago?'' ``Is this
pasta salad leftover from the church luncheon safe to eat?''
``Can't you just tell a turkey is done by wiggling the leg?'' I
usually answer a question with a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the $12 you're saving by not replacing those tomatoes worth
a bout of food poisoning?'' Or, ``Is wasting a bowl of pasta salad

MAKE THE RECKLESS AN ENDANGERED SPECIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks ago we visited the family of Gren Anderson who began
skiing a year ago and is well on his way to being a solid
intermediate. We let pass without comment a story Anderson told me,
which should not have passed.
</P>
<P>
   While he was taking a lesson, a snowboarder ran into him,
knocking him down, causing some pain, and giving him plenty to
worry about the next time he ventured out onto a trial. During his
next lesson, his instructor skied on Anderson's uphill side to
protect him from any other unguided missile that might be headed
his way.
</P>
<P>
   With our story a couple of weeks ago focusing on Anderson's
delight with his new sport, we unfortunately let slide the outrage
that he was blindsided by an out-of-control boarder.
</P>
<P>
   I could fill this space and much more with letters of horror,
hate, stupidity, and slope rage from people with tales similar to
Anderson's. Anecdotal though it may be, it does seem that such
incidences are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Reenforced by news accounts from throughout ski country, the
evidence is pretty clear that some skiers and boarders are not only
out of control but that they are a danger to others on the slopes.
Lest you think the complaints apply only to snowboarders, read from
a letter by Joan Hatch of Andover, Mass.:
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened on one of those what I call classic ski days.
Perfect snow, blue sky, bright sun. We were skiing at (name held
because the area needn't be singled out; it happens everywhere)
down a main intermediate slope. My husband and I were stopped at
the side of a trail looking at a trail map when four teenage boys
came flying around a corner on skis, racing each other. It was
obvious that they couldn't ski very well, but that wasn't about to
slow them down. As they tried to cut the corner where we stood,
three of the boys went in front of us, and you can guess where the
fourth one tried to go _ between us and the woods behind us about 2
feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, he didn't make it, but was going too fast to
stop, and careened into my husband, knocking him into me. All three
of us went down. My husband broke two ribs, I had two bad bruises,
and the young man was also injured so badly he also had to be taken
down in a first-aid sled. Many things were said, you may be sure,
but the one I remember best was the young man saying to us, `You
were right in my way! I didn't have anywhere to go. This wasn't my
fault.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This may be the most flagrant case, but it is only one of many.
It could have been far worse for the Hatches than bruises and
broken ribs.
</P>
<P>
   According to John Frew, president of Colorado Ski Country, the
reports of ``road rage'' on the slopes is rising throughout the
Rockies, and a number of deaths can be attributed to such
recklessness. Frew spoke on the very day a snowboarder was killed
by a skier who ran into him, airborne, at an Oregon ski area.
</P>
<P>
   In response to this alarming trend, Vail _ one of the busiest
resorts in the country _ has gone beyond the incessant analyses of
safety figures. Over February vacation week, it took a simple but
effective action to at least give the perception that it gives a
damn: It deputized safety patrols.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is not new and has been tried in various forms. Many
years ago, the late King Ridge in New Hampshire had ``courtesy
patrols'' _ regular skiers at the area who were empowered to ask
skiers to slow down, stay in control, and to report violators to
the ski patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds kind of nerdy, you say? What's the alternative? The
patrol staff is simply not large to do the job, areas acknowledge,
and for the cost of a free lift ticket, the ski area at least has a
deputy patrol person to keep an eye out.
</P>
<P>
   Most areas put up ``SLOW'' signs in areas of heavy traffic,
especially where mixed abilities come together in a runout to a
lift. But how many areas put a ski patroller around the ``SLOW''
sign to see how many youngsters use it as a slalom gate?
</P>
<P>
   At Aspen's Snowmass Village _ another very busy resort _
residents of the area became so incensed after a hit-and-run
accident that they have set up a $1,000 reward for information
leading to rogue skiers who flaunt safety on their slopes. The
bounty, according to a spokesman for the residents, turns everyone
into a patrolman. ``And they don't have to arrest anyone,'' he
said, ``just blow the whistle on some of the jerks out there.''

FLYNT RETURNS WITH PG MUCKRAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember a few weeks back when Hustler's Larry Flynt was the
most feared publisher in America after forcing the resignation of
House Speaker-elect Bob Livingston amid allegations of marital
infidelity? After a failed attempt to inflict similar damage on GOP
Congressman Bob Barr, Flynt vanished along with his threat to
expose the sexual misdeeds of other leading Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, fans of the porn king's style of Scarlet A journalism will
be able to plunk down $4.99 to purchase The Flynt Report, an
84-page magazine (with no advertising) that should arrive on your
newsstand in early April. Hustler editor Allan MacDonnell won't
reveal its contents, other than to say ``it's not going to be a
Hustler thing. It's going to be PG-rated'' and to mention several
other top Republicans (whose names we'll omit out of abiding
respect for the libel laws) who are ``gonna be very unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   According to his attorney, Alan Isaacman, Flynt took a break
from his public sexual sleuthing after the Barr episode because the
impeachment trial ended and because of difficult negotiations with
sources trying to claim his reward of up to $1 million. ``They
valued the information more than we did,'' says Isaacman.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacman would not say how much Flynt paid in his effort to
embarrass Republicans. But counting snitches and investigators,
MacDonnell put the figure at between $3 and $4 million.

   With the impending arrival of a new editor, one of journalism's
most reliably left-wing voices may soon be singing a different
tune. Roger Cohn, the former executive editor of Audubon magazine
and longtime environmental reporter at The Philadelphia Inquirer,
says it'll be reporting over ideology when he takes the reins of
Mother Jones in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the magazine has . . . leaned too heavily toward
commentary,'' says Cohn. ``To me, it's important that the magazine
take a hard look at the sacred cows of the left, to challenge the
readers' own assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   With a larger circulation (130,000) than either The New Republic
or the Nation, the 23-year-old Mother Jones is a standard-bearer
for liberal journalism, eagerly attacking such conservative icons
as Rupert Murdoch, Rush Limbaugh, and Newt Gingrich and accusing a
center-seeking Bill Clinton of being a ``good Republican
president.'' (To get a sense of its readership, 67 percent of the
respondents to an on-line poll on its Web site favored legalizing
drugs.)
</P>
<P>
   The magazine has done its share of hard-hitting reporting in
following the trail of filthy lucre: In his final column, outgoing
editor Jeffrey Klein characterized ``the money behind politics'' as
the dominant story of his tenure. But Cohn is not satisfied with
the staus quo, saying ``I really would like to improve the quality
of the writing . . . the direction I want to take the magazine in
is very journalistic, not ideological.''

   This is one time the overworked David-versus-Goliath analogy
fits. When the Duxbury, Mass. (population 14,800) proved unable to
support three weeklies, it was the big kid on the block who took
the fall. The Duxbury Mariner _ one of 117 papers owned by mutual
fund giant Fidelity's Community Newspaper Co. (CNC) _ is shutting
down after failing to compete with the independent Duxbury Clipper.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching only about 1,200 paying subscribers at its height, the
Mariner was purchased by CNC in 1995 and converted from a shopper
into a broadsheet, to no avail. ``There is no question there is no
need in Duxbury for a third weekly paper,'' said CNC president Kirk
Davis, explaining the decision to fold the tent.
</P>
<P>
   Still left standing is the Duxbury Reporter, a free weekly
mailed to almost 2,900 homes. But the real victor is The Duxbury
Clipper, an old-fashioned community weekly with 4,000 paid
subscribers that belongs in a Norman Rockwell painting.
</P>
<P>
   It's a real hometown paper,'' says editor Josh Cutler. ``When
they're born, their name is in the paper. When they go off to
school, their name is in the paper.'' Cutler is one of three
full-time staffers on the Clipper. But more important, he is the
scion of the Cutler publishing dynasty. His father, David, is the
Clipper's publisher and his grandparents, John and Roberta, founded
the paper in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see the little guy win one,'' he says.

   The 1980s officially ended on Nov. 21, 1990, when junk-bond king
Michael Milken was sentenced for violating securities laws. After
years of image rehab, Milken is now someone held in even lower
esteem than an ex-con. A journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Through his nonprofit economic think tank, the Milken Institute,
Milken has published the first issue of The Milken Institute
Review, a quarterly journal of economic policy that will initially
have a controlled circulation of about 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to find a happy niche between the popular business
and economic journals and academic journals,'' says Peter Passell,
the former New York Times staffer who is editor.
</P>
<P>
   The 84-page debut issue features everything from a Mark Alan
Stamaty cartoon ``Ekinomix'' to a quiz page (Did you know that
Massachusetts and California soak up 50 percent of new venture
capital?) to a piece on ``capital mobility.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly easy reading, even Milken's ``From The
Chairman'' message with its sentimental recollection of how his
father taught him to analyze corporate finances at age 8.

ROSIE O'DONNELL FRONTS A LARGELY GLITCH-FREE SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rosie O'Donnell presided over the 41st Grammy ceremony like an
old pro. She just showed up and did her Rosie thing, by turns
goofy, brash, and sly, but generally comfortable and always _
always! _ hammy. She put last year's pop-illiterate Grammy host,
Kelsey Grammer, quickly to shame, turning the 1999 event into three
hours of knowing goofs on the music world and Rosie-ized versions
of the hits (``Near, far, the Cross Your Heart bra,'' she sang).
She was everyone's greatest fan, the high-school funny girl, the
lovable misfit talking to the junior-class pretty girl from the
stage: ``Hi, Shania. You look nice.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the event seemed to be more about Rosie's routines than
the Grammys and their winners. But the West Coast gala was such a
remarkably smooth ride this year, it depended on O'Donnell's
attention-getting stunts and shtick for any hint of peppiness. No
one else was going to let go and make the Jerry Falwell Tinky Winky
joke, or mimic Latin pop performance winner Ricky Martin's ``hip
thing,'' or scream-sing a Steven Tyler song. The night contained a
painful shortage of glitches, botches, insults, controversial
political statements, and emotional moments _ the sort of
spontaneous bits that give these award telecasts their color. At
least O'Donnell filled in the gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there weren't grace notes along the way. Lauryn Hill
accepted her award for new artist by reading a Psalm, and later
delivered a sweet version of her song to her son, ``Zion,'' with
Carlos Santana on hand to play his licks from her album. No longer
angry, Alanis Morissette delivered a poised version of
``Uninvited,'' which won rock song and female rock vocal awards,
and Will Smith warmly accepted for best rap solo by admitting that
he had just learned his son's ``rhyming skills are down'' in
school. It was all sedate and, at points, sleepy.
</P>
<P>
   Only one or two pop in-jokes had slightly racy overtones. First,
a pair of sushi chefs on stage after Madonna's Asian-themed opener
revealed the words ``Soy'' and ``Bomb'' on their chests. They were
there as reminders of last year, when a crazed performance artist
surprised Bob Dylan during his heartfelt rendition of ``Love Sick''
by convulsing with those words written on his bare torso. Then
Jerry Seinfeld alluded to one of the more controversial episodes of
``Seinfeld'' as he presented an award with Jennifer Lopez. ``I'm
Jewish, and you are . . .?'' he said. After Lopez replied, ``100
percent Puerto Rican,'' Seinfeld archly waved a miniature Puerto
Rican flag and said, ``Viva Puerto Rico.'' Last year, Hispanic
leaders denounced a plot that had Kramer setting the Puerto Rican
flag on fire and stomping it out.
</P>
<P>
   With one or two exceptions, the fashions were tame. The spy vs.
spy award went to Shania Twain: Early in the evening, both in the
red carpet interviews and in her Shrine Auditorium seat, she was
regal and noble in a bright, sparkly, Audrey Hepburn-necked gown.
The subliminal message was ``white sugar.'' But when she came
onstage to sing ``Man, I Feel Like a Woman,'' Twain had become the
ultimate bad girl, stuffed into a very short, tight, silky black
dress, with tall black boots and long black gloves.
</P>
<P>
   But the boldest fashion statement goes to Madonna. Some 15 years
after she broke onto the pop scene, she is still the Sybil of
style, and she kicked off the gala by leaving yet another indelible
image on our eyeballs. This time she was a red-hot groovin' geisha
(or ``the little geisha that could,'' as O'Donnell said), singing a
full-voiced version of ``Nothing Really Matters'' and swinging her
shiny and profoundly straight black hair. Somehow, she managed to
dance in a pair of cartoonishly arched clogs.
</P>
<P>
   The red carpet action also rated notably low on the garishness
meter. Usually, watching the celebrities trip on their tacky gowns
as they wander into the auditorium, making awkward small talk with
cable TV anchors like Melissa ``How Cool Was That'' Rivers,
provides a special kind of cheap, jittery, aniticipatory high. But
the preshow specials on E! and MTV were quiet, with lots of premade
filler in between the on-site interviews. Morissette, tastefully
dressed and with unstringy hair, confessed, ``I love singing,'' and
Elvis Costello shamelessly plugged ``200 Cigarettes,'' the
forthcoming movie that includes his songs and a cameo. Steven Tyler
sang a ditty to MTV's Serena Altschul, and Brandy and Monica, whose
rift is tired old news indeed, held hands as they talked to E!'s
David Adelson. ``People, we're friends,'' Brandy said. ``Get over
it.''

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CARACAS, Venezuela _ When Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias was
officially declared president-elect of Venezuela last December,
``El Comandante,'' as he is known to his supporters, cited the
words of the 19th century independence fighter and national hero
Simon Bolivar, ``all I am is a frail straw being dragged along in a
revolutionary hurricane.''
 &HT;    As candidate and perhaps even president-elect being a ``frail
straw'' is fine, but President Chavez, who started a five-year term
last month, must now gain his bearings fast. The economy is
plunging into recession. The budget is flying out of control.
Nothing has been secured _ economic policy reforms, investor
confidence and popular demands for a better standard of living are
blowing in the wind.
 &HT;    Indeed, Venezuela in 1999 faces one of the greatest challenges
in its modern history. Chavez's landslide victory over the
traditional political parties and the dramatic price decline of its
principal commodity, oil, last year marked the collapse of the
economic and political models that dominated the country for the
past 40 years. The task of reconstruction now falls into the hands
of Chavez, a 44-year-old, former paratrooper who led a failed coup
attempt in 1992.
 &HT;    ``There is no room for mistakes,'' says Luis Henrique Ball, head
of the industry association, Confederacion Venezolana de
Industriales (Conindustria).
 &HT;    Record low prices for oil have decimated petroleum revenue,
which accounts for as much as 70 percent of the country's exports
and half of the government's revenue. Oil export earnings plunged
some US$7 billion to about $11 billion in 1998, forcing dramatic
cuts in expenditures by state-run oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela (PDVSA) and the government alike. Nonetheless, the public
deficit finished last year at an estimated 9 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP).
 &HT;    Hundreds of sub-contractors and suppliers to the oil industry
have shut down; unemployment has jumped from 11 percent to as much
as 20 percent, according to industry sources. The economy
contracted by an estimated 1 percent last year and, according to
many estimates, is expected to shrink at least another 2 percent in
1999.
 &HT;    Chavez himself rose to power on a wave of popular discontent
with the deterioration of real incomes and basic public services
such as health, education, and justice. Real incomes per capita
have fallen by two-thirds over the past two decades and, although
Venezuela is one of the oil-richest countries in the world, an
estimated 70 percent of the country's 23 million people live in
poverty.
 &HT;    Since his election, however, Chavez has moderated his populist
rhetoric and anti-establishment platform. ``We certainly do not
want a communist economic model but we also reject the savage
neo-liberal model,'' Chavez says.
 &HT;    He has shelved his trademark military-style red beret and taken
to wearing a business suit. Instead of speaking about revising
privatization contracts, halting foreign debt payments, and
shutting down Congress, he now talks of strict fiscal discipline,
endorsing foreign investment, and negotiating with Congress. In a
show of continuity, he even retained Finance Minister Maritza
Izaguirre, who was appointed under the Caldera Administration.
 &HT;    Venezuela's new president, for example, aims to cut public
spending by reducing the number of government ministries, slashing
the public sector payroll, and restructuring the profile of foreign
debt payments. He hopes to increase revenue with better tax
collection _ with the very optimistic goal of an additional $5
billion annually _ and a crackdown on corruption in customs.
 &HT;    The government's success in maintaining fiscal discipline and
boosting the autonomy of the Central Bank, as announced, will
largely determine its success in bringing down a stubborn inflation
rate of near 30 percent in 1998, still one of Latin America's
highest. The Central Bank currently lacks sufficient financial
instruments to practice an adequate monetary policy.
 &HT;    Yet some analysts say the government will not be able to bring
its accounts in order without raising funds on international
capital markets and reaching an agreement with the International
Monetary Fund. ``We are going to need a Brazilian-style package and
international help to refinance our foreign debt obligations,''
says Conindustria's Ball.
 &HT;    Others are concerned the Chavez government may excessively tap
the coffers of PDVSA to subsidize agricultural activities and fund
social programs. Chavez has been critical of PDVSA's management,
saying the company is run as ``a state within a state.'' He has
promised to eliminate fringe benefits including ``the fleets of
private aircraft, overseas travel and credit cards without limit.''
 &HT;    The government has also pledged to respect contracts signed with
domestic and foreign oil companies in recent years to develop vast
oil fields. The private sector has announced investments worth an
estimated $7.2 billion in 1999, more than twice the $2.5 billion
spent in 1998. That comes on top of PDVSA's $3.8 billion in capital
investment in 1999. This could have an important ripple effect in
the economy, kick-starting many service and supply companies.
 &HT;    Some of these oil projects are already being delayed and many
experts say the picture could get worse as oil prices are expected
to remain low for some years to come.
 &HT;    Facing such a scenario, the Chavez government has revived the
country's long-held goal of diversifying the economy, developing
agriculture, tourism and other non-oil sectors.
 &HT;    The public/private investment promotion agency Consejo Nacional
de Promocion de Inversiones (Conapri) says it has identified some
$32 billion in potential investment over the 5-year government term
(1999-2004). Heading the list are infrastructure projects that will
require some $6 billion, followed by mining with $4.3 billion, iron
and steel with $3.2 billion, and petrochemicals with $3 billion.
``Provided the government implements a program towards
macroeconomic stabilization, we could see such investment in coming
years,'' says Luis Soto, head of Conapri.
 &HT;    With immense diversity and unique tourist attractions,
Venezuela's tourism potential is large, industry experts say, and
much of the necessary infrastructure is already in place. New
hotels and international air links have been inaugurated recently.
``What we are looking for primarily from the government is targeted
promotion abroad,'' says Francisco Crededio, a Caracas-based
tourism consultant. Tourism operators are also calling on the
government to further professional education so as to staff hotels
and airlines with trained personnel.
 &HT;    ``I'm very optimistic. For the first time a new government is
appointing experienced professionals and not political supporters
to the government tourism agency,'' says Crededio. Previously, he
says, government officials charged with inspecting hotels ``had no
idea at all'' about the industry. Crededio says Venezuela could
boost the number of visitors from currently 700,000 per year to
around 3 million within five years.
 &HT;    Privatization could also bring in big investments, but the
Chavez government's commitment to the concept is unclear. Officials
have said that they do not oppose privatization, except for the
sale of PDVSA's domestic operations and those of hydroelectric
power company Edelca, which generates some 70 percent of the
country's electricity. His advisors say they are reviewing PDVSA's
foreign assets (except for the U.S. company Citgo) for possible
sale.
 &HT;    However, shortly after Chavez's election last December, the
Venezuelan government postponed the bidding for an electricity
distribution company in order ``to review the terms of the sale.''
Just how long the process remains suspended may be indicative of
the government's resolve.
 &HT;    The country's largely state-run power sector is dramatically
undercapitalized, plagued by red tape, corruption, and
inefficiency. Power shortages are common and extremely costly to
business and industry. According to one estimate, the industry
requires as much as $20 billion in capital investment over coming
years.
 &HT;    Even with the potentially important revenues from the sale of
oil and power assets, Chavez will have to create a positive
investment climate, particularly by setting clear rules of the
game, slashing red tape, and tackling corruption in the judiciary.
In a recent paper on economic guidelines for the new government,
the influential employers trade group, Federacion Venezolana de
Camaras y Asociaciones de Comercio y Produccion (Fedecamaras),
said, ``If the bureaucracy, which stimulates corruption, is cut
back to a minimum, and we have a state that facilitates instead of
complicates business, certainly the private sector will respond
with new initiatives creating jobs and wealth.''
 &HT;    Yet the plan to form a constituent assembly to rewrite the
Constitution raises the prospects of a prolonged period of
uncertainty. With a new Carta Magna, companies could face new rules
of the game. ``Until there is a new order, a new state, uncertainty
will be present in Venezuelan society,'' says retired general
Alberto Muller, Chavez's former campaign manager. In addition, it
will be difficult for the government to implement unpopular
austerity measures and sweeping market-oriented reform before the
new Constitution is approved.
 &HT;    As a result, private capital investment could remain on the
sidelines for some time to come. ``I don't expect private
investment to recover until at least the third or fourth quarter of
this year'', says one prominent economist in Caracas, who forecast
a decline of between 2 percent and 3 percent in gross domestic
product next year. ``Of course it could be much longer,'' he adds.
 &HT;    Few Venezuelan manufacturers anticipate significant economic
recovery in the near future. ``There won't be any expansion before
the year 2000. We will be happy to survive,'' says Henry Gomez,
head of the industry chamber, Federacion de Micros, Pequenos, y
Medianos Industriales de Venezuela (Fedeindustria).
 &HT;    The automobile industry expects sales of no more than 100,000
units this year, compared to the estimated 180,000 for 1998. ``It
is going to be a year of belt-tightening,'' says Alfredo Behrens,
head of Toyota de Venezuela.
 &HT;    Sacrificing 1999 may be worth it, if President Chavez can lay
the groundwork for a sustained recovery thereafter. In the past,
governments, such as that of former President Rafael Caldera, have
started out with a series of short-term policies that provide for
an initial boom, followed by a bust. Industry association head Ball
thinks Chavez is off to a good start. He says,'' If Chavez
continues along these lines, he could do things that president
Rafael Caldera could not.''
 &HT;    Others are less optimistic. ``It's not going to work. It's not
just the budget, it's a matter of philosophy. He is going to take
us back to a 1930s-style paternalist, populist government,'' says
Robert Bottome, head of Veneconomy consultancy.

NET STOCKS ARE HOT NOW, BUT DON'T FORGET BIOTECH 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If philosopher George Santayana was right, and those who forget
the past are doomed to repeat it, then this may be a good time for
a history lesson. Set the wayback machine for the early 1990s,
Sherman. We're going back to the biotechnology boom on Wall Street,
a development with some eerie parallels to the current mania for
Internet stocks. Notes Katherine Kirk, an investment banker with
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in Boston: ``Investors are in love again.''
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology stocks took off in 1990 when one of the industry's
leaders, Amgen Inc., produced the first biotech blockbuster, a key
drug for kidney dialysis patients. For investors the message was
clear: Biotech was ready to move from the laboratory to the
marketplace. Diseases would be cured; money would be made. Hardly
any biotech companies were making money at the time, but that
didn't matter. Profits took a back seat to potential.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen's stock price rocketed from 7 to 78 in a short period of
time. In 1991, Fidelity's Select Biotechnology fund climbed an
astounding 99 percent and its assets ballooned from $70 million to
$1.1 billion in less than two years. It looked as if the sky was
the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Only it wasn't. In early 1992 the stocks started to tumble as
investors questioned some of their early assumptions. And in the
spring of that year, when the US Food and Drug Administration
refused to approve drugs from two of the highest-flying biotech
companies, the rout was on. The stock price of Centocor Inc., one
of the spurned companies, fell from 60 to under 10.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology didn't disappear. A handful of companies,
including Amgen, have gone on to become large, profitable
businesses. But investors never made the kind of money they dreamed
about in those heady days. The Fidelity biotech fund, for instance,
has less money in it today than it did at the peak in 1991.
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist's own biotech index is no higher than it was back
then.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if we had a wild New Year's Eve Party and the hangover
lasted years,'' says Brian Stack, portfolio manager of MFS New
Discovery fund.
</P>
<P>
   Investment pros who lived through both periods will tell you
there are important differences between biotechnology and the
Internet. Biotech's progress in bringing products to market was
agonizingly slow; the Internet seems to grow at lightspeed. Biotech
had the potential to change medicine; the Internet may yet change
every business it touches.
</P>
<P>
   But there are parallels between the two booms as well, say money
managers. And perhaps a few cautionary lessons too. What can we
learn from studying the biotechnology bubble?
</P>
<P>
   1. It's hard to pick the ultimate winners at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine you are a farmer planting seeds in the spring. Can you
say, at that point, which plants will grow tall and straight and
which will never sprout? An investor evaluating companies in an
emerging industry is in much the same position.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are dealing with a new technology and no one knows how the
story will play out,'' says David Stone, who followed biotechnology
stocks for the Boston office of Cowen &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen and Centocor were both early biotech leaders. One soared,
the other stumbled, at least until recently. And Biogen Inc., a
Cambridge company that has been a Wall Street favorite, didn't come
on the radar screen until 1996.
</P>
<P>
   2. Sometimes it's even hard to know who the players are.
</P>
<P>
   Investors assumed that biotechnology was a world unto itself.
They were wrong. At the same time biotech companies were busy in
their labs, the major drug companies were even busier working on
blockbuster drugs for the future. With the benefit of hindsight,
investors who believed in the promise of biotech should have been
investing in companies like Merck &AMP; Co. and Pfizer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Internet is viewed today as a distinct field with
distinct companies. But who is to say that the ultimate winners in
the Internet competition won't be established names like Wal-Mart
or IBM rather than Amazon.com and Yahoo?
</P>
<P>
   3. Euphoria has a way of blinding people to risk.
</P>
<P>
   In their enthusiasm for biotech stocks, investors failed to
appreciate how long it would take to turn good ideas into
marketable products. With the Internet, the risk may be just the
opposite. Because there are practically no barriers to entry, just
about anyone can jump into the Internet business overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with a much fiercer competitive landscape,''
says Kirk of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. In such a world, she says,
competitive advantage can vanish as quickly as it appears. Which
leads to an obvious question: Is that risk built into the price of
Internet stocks?
</P>
<P>
   4. Promise is not the same thing as profit.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas O'Neill, chief investment officer at Fleet Financial
Group Inc., says it was hard not to be excited by the potential of
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were talking about curing diseases,'' he recalls. ``These
were exciting things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has the same kind of buzz about it. Like
biotechnology, it could change the way we live our lives. But
eventually that excitement has to find its way to the bottom line.
Companies don't have to make money in the early days. New firms can
have valuations that look preposterous on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   But down the road investors need to see a real return.
Otherwise, as the biotech boom demonstrated, soaring stock prices
can come back to earth in a hurry.

   As kitchen gadgets go, the Butter Poterie is one of the better
ones. It's small, attractive and actually works.
</P>
<P>
   The poterie is a bell-shaped crock that you fill with butter and
invert into a matching container of water. The crock, which you can
leave on the kitchen counter, keeps butter at room temperature so
it's spreadable. The water seals the butter and prevents spoilage.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't want watery butter, you say. No problem. Butter is
fat and the water rolls off as if it were on a duck's back.
</P>
<P>
   The Butter Poterie comes in six designs, ranging in price from
$21.95 to $24.95. It is available by mail order from L. Tremain
Inc., Marina del Rey, Calif., at 888-575-1900.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Congress tries to buy enlistments
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, Feb. 28, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not surprising that the Congress last week quickly and
overwhelmingly passed a healthy pay and benefits increase for our
people in the Armed Forces. Statistics showed that enlistments and
re-enlistments in the military were woefully low.
</P>
<P>
   It is reported that the branches of our military will need about
200,000 new enlistments this year alone _ and the chances of
achieving that are not good.
</P>
<P>
   But any thought that a slightly larger paycheck is going to get
a person to join, or one to re-up, is to miss the real point of why
so many are declining to remain: Someone could get killed out
there.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. has become unbridled in its use of U.S. troops around
the world. After frosty experiences in Bosnia, our young men and
women in uniform now face the possibility of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we remain pitiably exposed in the Middle East,
exposed to germ warfare, missiles and terrorism. The Iraq situation
involves actual combat as well as jeopardy on a daily basis
</P>
<P>
   Being in the Army or the Navy isn't exactly as it is depicted in
those TV ads during football games. Indeed, you do see the world
and you can get a college education, but lately Army life has been
in full battle gear rather than on a day's leave or in a classroom.
</P>
<P>
   This is not meant to detract from the fact that our military was
in need of, and had earned, those increased paychecks and benefits
from the government. With all those billions and billions of
dollars being devoted to pork, waste and mismanagement, what's
wrong with throwing a few billion into the hands of soldiers,
sailors, Marines and airmen?
</P>
<P>
   Our worldwide adventures in the guise of stopping communism,
dictators, drug dealers and warlords have exposed U.S. troops to
previously uncharted territories, and it has not always been
supported by the U.S. people.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers have little choice; they are sent.
</P>
<P>
   What choice they do have is to decide whether to re-enlist. As
President Clinton, without benefit of congressional approval, moves
his soldiers around the globe to put out what he considers to be
critical fires, the chances of major losses loom.
</P>
<P>
   Military spokesmen claim young men and women no longer think of
the military when planning careers, but let's be realistic: For a
great number of America's youth, joining the military is a way out
of a hard civilian life. Not all of us can become rocket
scientists, lawyers or presidents. So many join up. Or, rather,
many did join up.
</P>
<P>
   But with the authority of presidents to commit troops to foreign
conflicts, even over the protests of usually opposition-party
congressmen and women, the element of physical danger increases
dramatically. Eighteen-year-old kids do not savor the idea of
signing up to make themselves available for dangerous duty in a
desert half a world away.
</P>
<P>
   So intense was the Congress to pass this legislation that it
broke down all political and budgetary barriers. The few who
questioned the move did not do so in opposition to military pay
raises but did by questioning where the money was coming from.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about it, the protagonists insisted, we'll get it.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm certain they will, just as Ronald Reagan got all that
money to build up our military nearly two decades ago _ from a
money-printing machine.
</P>
<P>
   Money is not going to bloat our military ranks. What we really
need to question is why we need such a large military complement.
When do we stop being the world's policemen? What is the threat to
the U.S. by civil war action in Yugoslavia between ethnic Serbs and
Albanians?
</P>
<P>
   When youngsters join the service, they rarely think they are
going to be killed, yet when they step across the line at the
recruitment station, their lives do belong to someone else.
Soldiers should not be surprised, or disillusioned, if they are
sent off to war; that's why they're there in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   But what needs to be examined, also, is why we go off to so many
murky wars, so many that are not our wars. If we're really trying
to find out why enlistment and re-enlistment is down, the answer is
not in a paycheck; it's in our policy.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    CARACAS, Venezuela Cuando Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias fue
oficialmente declarado presidente electo de Venezuela en diciembre
pasado, El Comandante, como lo conocen sus seguidores, cito estas
palabras de Simon Bolivar: ``No soy mas que una debil paja
arrastrada en un huracan revolucionario.''
 &HT;    Como candidato, y quiza incluso como presidente electo, ser una
``debil paja'' no era nada malo, pero el presidente Chavez, que el
mes pasado comenzo un mandato de cinco anos, ahora debe demostrar
un sentido preciso del rumbo. La economia venezolana esta en
recesion. El presupuesto esta descontrolado. No hay nada asegurado:
ni las reformas economicas ni la confianza de los inversionistas, y
las demandas del pueblo de un mejor nivel de vida revolotean por
los aires.
 &HT;    De hecho, la Venezuela de 1999 enfrenta uno de los mayores retos
de su historia moderna. La abrumadora victoria sobre los partidos
tradicionales y la aguda reduccion del precio de su principal
producto de exportacion, el petroleo, marco el ano pasado el
colapso de los modelos economico y politico que han dominado el
pais durante los ultimos 40 anos. La tarea de la reconstruccion
esta ahora en manos de Chavez, el ex paracaidista de 44 anos que en
1992 dirigio una intentona golpista.
 &HT;    ``No hay espacio para cometer errores,'' dice Luis Enrique Ball,
director de la Confederacion Venezolana de Industriales
(Conindustria).
 &HT;    Los bajisimos precios del crudo han afectado los ingresos del
pais: el petroleo representa el 70 por ciento de las exportaciones
y el 50 por ciento de los ingresos del gobierno. Los ingresos por
concepto de exportacion del crudo bajaron US$7.000, a US$11.000
millones en 1998, lo que obligo al gobierno y a la estatal
Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) a realizar profundas reducciones de
gastos. Sin embargo, el deficit publico termino 1998 a un nivel
estimado del 9 por ciento del Producto Interno Bruto (PIB).
 &HT;    Cientos de subcontratistas y suministradores del sector
petrolero han tenido que suspender sus actividades; el desempleo ha
aumentado del 11 por ciento a casi el 20 por ciento, segun fuentes
del sector industrial. Se calcula que la economia se contrajo un 1
por ciento en 1998 y se espera que se contraiga un 2 por ciento
adicional en 1999.
 &HT;    Chavez llego al poder impulsado por una ola de descontento
popular debido al deterioro del ingreso real y de los servicios
basicos como la salud, la educacion y la justicia. El ingreso real
per capita ha bajado en dos terceras partes durante las ultimas dos
decadas y, aunque Venezuela es uno de los paises que mas petroleo
tiene en el mundo, se calcula que aproximadamente el 70 por ciento
de los 23 millones de venezolanos viven en la pobreza.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, desde su eleccion, Chavez ha moderado su retorica
populista y su plataforma contra los poderes establecidos. ``No
queremos un modelo economico comunista, y tambien rechazamos el
salvaje modelo neoliberal,'' dice Chavez.
 &HT;    El presidente venezolano ha cambiado la boina roja por el traje.
En vez de revisar los contratos de privatizaciones, interrumpir el
servicio de la deuda externa y disolver el Congreso, ahora Chavez
habla de una disciplina fiscal estricta, de apoyar las inversiones
extranjeras y de negociar con el Congreso. En una muestra de
continuidad, incluso mantuvo en su puesto a la ministra de
Finanzas, Maritza Izaguirre, nombrada durante el gobierno de Rafael
Caldera.
 &HT;    El nuevo presidente de Venezuela, por ejemplo, planea reducir el
gasto publico mediante la eliminacion de varios ministerios, la
racionalizacion de la nomina del sector publico y la
reestructuracion de los pagos de la deuda externa. Chavez espera
hacer aumentar los ingresos mediante el cobro mas estricto de los
impuestos (con la optimista meta de recaudar US$5.000 millones
anuales adicionales) y la eliminacion de la corrupcion en la
Aduana.
 &HT;    El exito del gobierno en mantener la disciplina fiscal y mejorar
la autonomia del Banco Central, como se ha anunciado, determinara
en lo fundamental su exito a la hora de reducir una testaruda
inflacion del 30 por ciento en 1998, una de las mas altas de
America Latina. Por su parte, el Banco Central no cuenta con
instrumentos financieros suficientes para practicar una politica
monetaria adecuada.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, algunos analistas afirman que el gobierno no podra
poner en orden sus cuentas sin recaudar fondos en los mercados
internacionales de capital y sin llegar a un acuerdo con el Fondo
Monetario Internacional (FMI). ``Vamos a necesitar un paquete de
medidas similar al de Brasil, y con ayuda internacional para
refinanciar nuestras obligaciones de deuda exterior,'' afirma Ball,
de Conindustria.
 &HT;    A otros les preocupa que el gobierno de Chavez saque demasiados
fondos de PDVSA para subsidiar el sector agricola y financiar
programas sociales. Chavez ha criticado la administracion de PDVSA,
diciendo que la empresa funciona como ``un estado dentro de otro
estado,'' y ha prometido eliminar beneficios como ``las flotillas
de aviones privados, viajes al extranjero y tarjetas de credito sin
limite de gastos.''
 &HT;    El gobierno tambien ha prometido respetar los contratos firmados
en anos recientes con empresas petroleras nacionales y extranjeras
para explotar enormes yacimientos de crudo. El sector privado ha
anunciado inversiones por un valor aproximado de US$7.200 millones
en 1999, mas del doble de los US$2.500 millones invertidos en 1998,
aparte de los US$3.800 millones de inversion de capital de PDVSA en
1999. Esta inyeccion economica podria tener una importante
repercusion en la economia al dar lugar a la creacion de empresas
de servicios y suministros.
 &HT;    Algunas obras petroleras ya se retrasan y muchos especialistas
dicen que el panorama podria empeorar si, como se espera, los
precios del petroleo se mantienen bajos por varios anos.
 &HT;    Ante esas perspectivas, el gobierno de Chavez ha resucitado la
vieja meta nacional de diversificar la economia y desarrollar la
agricultura, el turismo y otros sectores no petroleros.
 &HT;    El Consejo Nacional de Promocion de Inversiones (Conapri), una
entidad del sector publico y del privado, ha senalado posibles
inversiones por un total de US$32.000 millones en el periodo de
gobierno de cinco anos (1999-2004). Encabezan la lista obras de
infraestructura que requeriran unos US$6.000 millones, seguidas por
la mineria con US$4.300 millones, el hierro y el acero con US$3.200
millones y la petroquimica con US$3.000 millones. ``Si el gobierno
implementa un programa para lograr la estabilizacion
macroeconomica, en los proximos anos veremos llegar esas
inversiones,'' afirma Luis Soto, director de Conapri.
 &HT;    El potencial turistico de Venezuela es enorme debido a la
diversidad del pais y a sus atracciones unicas, senalan expertos
del sector, y gran parte de la infraestructura necesaria ya esta en
pie. Recientemente se han inaugurado hoteles y enlaces aereos
internacionales. ``Lo que mas necesitamos del gobierno es una
promocion dirigida al extranjero,'' senala Francisco Crededio,
consultor de turismo radicado en Caracas. Los operadores de turismo
tambien quieren que el gobierno proporcione instruccion profesional
para que los hoteles y las aerolineas cuenten con personal
capacitado.
 &HT;    ``Me siento muy optimista. Por primera vez un nuevo gobierno
nombra a profesionales con experiencia para el organismo turistico
y no a partidarios politicos,'' dice Crededio. Agrega que
anteriormente los funcionarios de gobierno a cargo de inspeccionar
los hoteles ``no tenian la menor idea'' del sector. Crededio dice
que Venezuela podria incrementar el numero de visitantes de 700.000
al ano actualmente a unos tres millones en cinco anos.
 &HT;    La privatizacion tambien podria aportar inversiones cuantiosas,
pero la postura del gobierno de Chavez hacia ese concepto es
ambigua.Los funcionarios han afirmado que no se oponen a la
privatizacion, excepto a la venta de las operaciones nacionales de
PDVSA y a las de la empresa hidroelectrica Edelca, que genera
alrededor del
 &HT;    70 por ciento de la electricidad del pais. Los asesores de
Chavez dicen que estan revisando los activos extranjeros de PDVSA,
excepto la empresa Citgo, en Estados Unidos, para su posible venta.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, poco despues del triunfo electoral de Chavez en
diciembre de 1998, el gobierno venezolano pospuso la licitacion de
una empresa de distribucion de electricidad con el fin de ``revisar
los terminos de la venta.'' El tiempo que el proceso se mantenga
suspendido puede ser un indicador de la voluntad privatizadora del
gobierno.
 &HT;    El sector energetico, mayormente en manos estatales, esta muy
descapitalizado y plagado por la burocracia, la corrupcion y la
ineficiencia. Los apagones son comunes y muy costosos para los
negocios y la industria. Segun un calculo, la industria necesita
hasta US$20.000 millones en inversiones de capital en los anos
proximos.
 &HT;    Inc luso con los importantes ingresos de la venta de activos
petroleros y energeticos, Chavez tendra que crear un clima propicio
para la inversion, sobre todo estableciendo reglas claras,
reduciendo la burocracia y atajando la corrupcion en el sistema
judicial. En un reciente documento sobre las directrices economicas
del nuevo gobierno, la influyente Federacion Venezolana de Camaras
y Asociaciones de Comercio y Produccion (Fedecamaras) dijo: ``Si la
burocracia, que estimula la corrupcion, se reduce a un minimo, y
tenemos un Estado que da facilidades a los negocios en vez de
darles complicaciones, no hay duda de que el sector privado
respondera con nuevas iniciativas creando empleos y riqueza.''
 &HT;    Pero el plan de formar una asamblea constituyente para redactar
una nueva Constitucion puede dar lugar a un prolongado periodo de
incertidumbre. Con una nueva Carta Magna, las empresas podrian
afrontar regulaciones nuevas. ``Hasta que haya un nuevo orden, un
nuevo Estado, la incertidumbre estara presente en la sociedad
venezolana,'' dice el general retirado Alberto Muller, ex
administrador de la campana de Chavez. Ademas, al gobierno le sera
dificil implementar impopulares medidas de austeridad y reformas de
mercado antes de que se apruebe una nueva Constitucion.
 &HT;    En consecuencia, las inversiones de capital privado podrian
verse frenadas por un tiempo. ``No espero que la inversion privada
se recupere por lo menos hasta el tercer o cuarto trimestre de este
ano,'' senala un destacado economista de Caracas, que pronostica
una declinacion de entre el 2 por ciento y el 3 por ciento en el
Producto Interno Bruto el ano proximo. ``Desde luego, podria ser
mucho mas prolongada,'' agrega.
 &HT;    Pocos fabricantes venezolanos preven una importante recuperacion
economica en el futuro cercano. ``No habra ninguna expansion antes
del 2000. Sobrevivir ya sera un gran triunfo,'' apunta Henry Gomez,
que preside la Federacion de Micros, Pequenos y Medianos
Industriales de Venezuela (Fedeindustria).
 &HT;    La industria automotriz no espera ventas superiores a las
100.000 unidades este ano, frente al estimado de 180.000 para 1998.
``Este ano nos vamos a tener que apretar el cinturon,'' dice
Alfredo Behrens, presidente de Toyota de Venezuela.
 &HT;    Tal vez valga la pena sacrificar 1999, si el presidente Chavez
logra echar las bases de una recuperacion ulterior. Gobiernos
pasados como el del ex presidente Rafael Caldera han comenzado con
una serie de estrategias a corto plazo que crean un auge inicial y
luego una caida. Ball, el director de Conindustria, piensa que
Chavez va a tener un buen comienzo. Comenta: ``Si Chavez se
mantiene en esa linea, podria hacer lo que Caldera no pudo.''
 &HT;    Otros no son tan optimistas. ``No va a funcionar. No se trata
solo del presupuesto: es una cuestion de mentalidad. Chavez nos va
a llevar al pasado, a un gobierno paternalista, de corte populista,
como en los anos 30,'' afirma Robert Bottome, director de una
consultoria.

MURDER OVER THE HIGH SEAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They were trying to save lives. Three years ago this week, they
paid with their own.
</P>
<P>
   When Armando Alejandre, Carlos Costa, Mario de la Pena, and
Pablo Morales took to the skies that day in their little
blue-and-white Cessna 337s, their plan was to search the Florida
Straits for stranded boat people, refugees fleeing Cuba in
makeshift rafts or flimsy inner tubes. There was little enough the
fliers could do for any rafters they came upon _ toss down food and
bottled water, radio their location to the Coast Guard _ but that
little could make the difference between life and death.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four, Carlos was the most experienced. He had flown more
than 500 such missions for Brothers to the Rescue, and had saved
scores of boat people from drowning or dying of thirst. Armando, by
contrast, was going up for only the second time. What all four had
in common was a love of American liberty _ and a profound concern
for any Cubans so desperate to escape Fidel Castro's Caribbean
hellspot that they would risk their lives to get away.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 24, 1996, Carlos, Armando, Mario, and Pablo took off
from an airfield in Opa-Locka, Fla. They intended to fly to just
below the 24th parallel, well north of Cuba's territorial waters.
Both planes contacted Havana air-traffic controllers as they
approached the 24th parallel, identifying themselves and giving
their position. Whereupon the Cuban Air Force, without warning and
without reason, scrambled two MiG fighters and blew the rescue
planes out of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The planes and their passengers were disintegrated by the Cuban
MiGs. Only a large oil slick marked the spot where they went down.
No bodies were ever recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the men _ Carlos, Mario, and Armando _ were US
citizens. Pablo, a former refugee who had himself been saved by
Brothers to the Rescue in 1992, was a permanent US resident. What
happens when four American civilians are butchered in cold blood,
over international waters, by the air force of a Third World
dictatorship? What terrible retribution does the United States
exact for a quadruple murder so barbaric and unprovoked?
</P>
<P>
   The astonishing is: Nothing happens. There is no retribution.
Indeed, the Clinton administration takes the position not only that
Castro must not be punished for the four lives he destroyed, but
that the victims' families must not be permitted to recover
anything for their loss.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the shoot-down, under intense political pressure,
President Clinton agreed to sign the Helms-Burton Act. Title III of
the statute allows American citizens whose property was confiscated
by the Cuban government _ Castro nationalized billions of dollars'
worth of American assets in the 1960s _ to file suit against any
foreign company using that property. Title IV bars any officer of a
foreign company trafficking in stolen American property from
receiving a visa to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Properly enforced, Helms-Burton would weaken Castro's grip on
power by reducing the flow of foreign capital into his treasury.
But Helms-Burton is not properly enforced. Title III has never
taken effect because Clinton keeps suspending it (as the law
permits him to do if he finds that a suspension ``will expedite a
transition to democracy in Cuba''). Title IV has never taken effect
because the State Department refuses to carry it out.
</P>
<P>
   The hobbling of Helms-Burton is a stinging insult to the memory
of the four murdered men. But the Clinton administration has
delivered a cut unkinder still.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the families of Armando, Carlos, and Mario sued the
Cuban government for damages caused by the wrongful deaths of their
loved ones, a legal remedy specifically authorized by the
Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, Senior US District Judge James Lawrence King
awarded the plaintiffs $187.7 million in damages. ``Cuba's
extrajudicial killings . . . were inhumane acts against innocent
civilians,'' he wrote in his final judgment. ``The fact that the
killings were premeditated and intentional, outside Cuban
territory, wholly disproportionate, and executed without warning .
. . makes this act unique in its brazen flouting of international
norms.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the families attempted to collect their judgment out of
frozen Cuban assets, the Clinton administration blocked them. The
president famous for feeling people's pain is less concerned with
the pain of grief-stricken Americans, it would appear, than with
the pain Castro might feel if the judgment were paid.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's position is staggering. Castro is an open
and declared enemy of the United States and has been for 40 years.
In sending combat aircraft to slaughter four unarmed Americans
engaged in humanitarian rescue work, he committed an act of war.
</P>
<P>
   The response of the United States should have been to remove
Castro from power and put him in the dock for crimes against
humanity. (For the murder of just one American in 1989, the United
States invaded Panama and seized Manuel Noriega.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appeasement of Castro is a cruel betrayal. The
families of the dead Brothers to the Rescue deserve better from
their government. And the unhappy people of Cuba, bleeding under
Castro's whip, deserve better from their free and powerful neighbor
to the north.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Gun industry, you can save yourself
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a great idea for gun manufacturers, though they won't
think so right away: Their industry should start thinking about
supporting national gun control.
</P>
<P>
   No, really.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the industry faces a growing chaos of federal, state
and city regulations and laws _ and lawsuits, too _ whose
inconsistency and often ad hoc nature pester and confuse legitimate
owners, aid criminals by creating as many cracks as barriers and
nudge the manufacturers themselves into strategies that threaten in
the long run to be their own undoing.
</P>
<P>
   The long-standing but inanimate public support for control is
finally beginning to exert itself.
</P>
<P>
   A Brooklyn jury recently bought the argument, and brought in a
$4 million judgment for seven victim families, that 15 major gun
makers were legally negligent for flooding low-regulation states
with firearms they had to know would be smuggled to black markets
in strong-control states. Ninety percent of the guns criminals use
in New York state are bought elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   A number of cities, bloodied by gun violence, are filing similar
suits, and the NAACP is thinking of joining in to give the claims
some national oomph. And gun-control organizations, like Handgun
Control, have acquired enough political and lobbying savvy and
popular support that they've pretty much established a standoff
with the gun lobby in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has even managed to get two useful bills
enacted _ the Brady law and the ban on military-style assault
weapons _ and seems likely to win funding to add 10 cities to his
successful program in 27 that is tracing guns used by young
criminals back to their buyers. (Contrary to myth, most weapons
used by youths are not stolen but were bought for the kid market by
straw buyers.)
</P>
<P>
   Blocked in Congress, the National Rifle Association, the
manufacturers' faithful dogsbody, is resorting to frantic measures
in state legislatures, where its money still talks. Georgia's
Legislature has passed a law forbidding its cities to sue the
industry, and blocking bills are pending in nine other states.
</P>
<P>
   The industry as well is resorting to what look like desperate
means. With hunting slumping in an ever less rural America,
manufacturers increased the number of pistols they produced by 92
percent between 1985 and '93 and upped the firing speed and
caliber. Some are now making so-called ``pocket rockets'' _ small,
lightweight, easily concealed and still more powerful than older
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   It is inconceivable that the public will put up with this
escalation forever. The backlash, when it hits, could be furious
both in legislatures and the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be better to act before the human damage piles up
still higher? It is perfectly possible to draw national firearms
regulations that equally recognize the legitimate interests of
owners and protect public safety.
</P>
<P>
   (And thus incidentally secure a predictable and durable market
for the business itself, but it's OK if Colt, Smith &AMP; Wesson and
the rest don't thank me for that.)

THE HIDDEN SIDE OF HISTORIC HUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Feb. 15, 1851, Shadrach Minkins, an escaped slave new to
Boston, was waiting tables at a downtown coffeehouse when federal
marshals arrested him under the Fugitive Slave Act. He had fled
Norfolk, Va., about a year earlier, but a bounty hunter employed by
slaveholders had tracked him to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Later, while a large angry crowd of about 200 blacks gathered
outside the Custom House, then Boston's federal courthouse, a
smaller group of about 20 stormed the courtroom where Minkins was
being arraigned, overwhelmed two constables, and hustled him out of
the courtroom and eventually out of town to safety.
</P>
<P>
   While the Custom House survives _ as a timeshare resort _ you
won't find any mention of this dramatic piece of Boston history on
or near the building.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would anyone strolling past the Starbucks coffee shop on the
edge of City Hall Plaza, Boston's unintended monument to
brickmasons, have reason to suspect that they are on the site where
William Lloyd Garrison published The Abolitionist, the newspaper
that played a key role in rousing antislavery sentiments before the
Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the presence of the Black Heritage Trail on Beacon Hill
_ a collection of 14 historic sites, almost all from the
abolitionist period _ Boston's critical role in the history of
black America has been, in many cases, little noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Even the honored history leaves something to be desired. The
Black Heritage Trail lacks any visible signage _ in stark contrast
to the Freedom Trail, whose signature bright red stripe can
scarcely be avoided by anyone walking downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Even less visible than sites on the Black Heritage Trail is
black history from the period after the Civil War. While Boston is
a city sometimes obsessed with its history, much history of black
Boston is a story that remains largely invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Because so much of the city's sense of history is shaped by its
role as the birthplace of the American Revolution, its preserved
past is heavily dominated by sites from the Colonial and
Revolutionary period.
</P>
<P>
   That has been a source of pain, and complaint, for many of the
groups that have arrived in the city since, or whose early
contributions often went unacknowledged: African-Americans, after
all, trace their history in Boston back to the 1630s.
</P>
<P>
   The missing pieces range from such sites as the Abolitionist
office to the site that housed Columbus Avenue AME Church on
Columbus Avenue, to many sites in lower Roxbury that formed the
epicenter of black community life as blacks migrated from Beacon
Hill to the South End to lower Roxbury around the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   The truncated preservation of black history owes something to a
debate that occurred when the Black Heritage Trail was being
established in 1976: whether to attempt to commemorate sites that
no longer exist in their original form, or to limit the trail to
sites that people could actually visit.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when much history is absorbed via loudspeakers on tour
buses, it was no contest. Only places that still existed in
historically recognizable form made the list, and only sites from
the period when the black community lived on Beacon Hill _ even
though most black families were priced out of there after the Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, at least two important efforts are now underway to
promote more recent history of Boston's people of color.
</P>
<P>
   The most original and interesting of those is MYTOWN
(Multicultural Youth Tour of What's Now). That group trains
minority high school students to conduct walking tours of the South
End and lower Roxbury for tourists, introducing them to the history
of their people in Boston and promoting, its organizers hope, a
greater sense of belonging.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Boston History Collaborative, which recently
inaugurated a successful Literary Trail of Greater Boston, is also
planning an ``Abolition to Civil Rights'' project that would
encompass the history of black Bostonians after the period focused
on by the Heritage Trail.
</P>
<P>
   Both those efforts can only be an asset in encouraging
Bostonians of all backgrounds to embrace the full scope of the
city's history. Boston's history, after all, did not end with the
Revolution or the Civil War. It is only stubborn habit that leads
us to treat it as if it did.

FLAT RATE PHONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are fast approaching flat-rate telephone service. To some
extent, we're already there; MCI-WorldCom offers 5-cent Sundays,
AT&AMP;T offers ``one rate'' service, Sprint spins its famous dime. For
the moment, these offers are about minutes. In the near future,
they will be about months.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Three major forces are at work. The first is technology.
Not so long ago, there was only one way to make a local or long
distance phone call. For simplicity's sake, call it the Bell
Telephone method. In the near future, there will be as many as five
other ways to make that same phone call; over the Internet, over
cable television lines, over electricity lines and across two
already extant wireless systems (cellular and digital).
</P>
<P>
   The technology exists to make all these alternatives available
in less than five years. And major telecommunications corporations
are gearing up to do just that. AT&AMP;T bought TCI (the cable
television behemoth) for this reason (among others). AOL acquired
Teleport in anticipation of Internet telephony. US West acquired
Continental Cablevision and formed Mediaone, which is rolling out
local telephone service in Massachusetts this year. Bell Atlantic
will soon buy more cellular and digital telephone networks for its
system. The list goes on and on.
</P>
<P>
   These corporate conglomerations are made possible by
deregulation, which is the second reason that the cost of phone
service will soon be packaged into a flat-rate fee. Deregulation of
telecommunications services ensures that competition for your
business will escalate as more and more providers enter the market.
</P>
<P>
   Different companies approach the deregulated marketplace in
different ways. AT&AMP;T dreams of the day when you will use its
products seamlessly. You will use AT&AMP;T World Net for Internet
access, you will use AT&AMP;T for long distance and local telephone
service, you will use AT&AMP;T wireless service for mobile and you will
use AT&AMP;T paging and messaging services just to be safe. In
addition, AT&AMP;T will likely offer GPS positioning technology, so
that you will be able to know where your kids are, exactly, at any
given moment.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint has a slightly different game plan, as does WorldCom MCI,
as do the Regional Bell Operating Companies. Bell Atlantic
desperately wants to break into the Northeast corridor long
distance market, so that it can offer its ``local'' customers a
full array of telecommunications services. SBC Corp. last year
acquired Ameritech (having gobbled up Pacific Telesis before that)
in a bid to become, essentially, Ma Bell with a few regions of the
country missing.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation has transformed telephony from a regulated utility
business into a commodity business. In the not so distant future,
supply of telecommunications services will outstrip demand, causing
the price of the commodity to plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the third and perhaps most important reason
that telephone service will soon be a flat-rate product: Wall
Street. Wall Street is wildly enthusiastic about the future of
telecommunications and more than willing to overlook short-term
problems (like lower revenues from reduced phone bills). Wall
Street, in fact, encourages telecommunications executives to cut
prices for its services, on the theory that the service itself is a
kind of loss-leader. The real money to be made is in the customer
data-base.
</P>
<P>
   If AT&AMP;T has 60 million customers using the full range of its
telecommunications services, then it has a database whose value far
exceeds the value of the actual service it provides. And if AT&AMP;T
offers what Wall Street calls ``discounts for data,'' the value of
that database increases exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discounts for data'' is a simple trade between you and your
telecommunications provider. In return for flat-rate service (say,
$40 for all local and long distance, or $55 for all Internet,
local, long distance and paging), you fill out a detailed
questionnaire revealing your basic demographic information as well
as your interests, preferences, habits and the like. This data can
then be sold to companies who have products that may be useful to
you.
</P>
<P>
   This basic trade already happens on the Internet. Yahoo and
Excite offer free e-mail in exchange for the data they glean about
you from how you use their sites. Now that technology has
commoditized the phone business, ``discounts for data'' deals will
soon be a standard feature of telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
   How low can the cost of telephone service go? There are many
people in the high-tech world who believe that it will drop to
zero; the ultimate loss-leader. That probably won't occur, but it's
not out of the question. Whatever happens, it is certain that the
``one rate'' plans of the future will be calculated not in minutes,
but in months and years.

EVEN CONCRETE HAS A WEAKNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I poured 3 inches of concrete over my concrete basement
floor, which was full of cracks. The new floor has developed cracks
that line up with the cracks in the original floor. I plan to use
the cellar as an animal shelter, so the floor has to be waterproof.
What next?
</P>
<P>
   D.R., Halifax, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Concrete is great stuff _ in compression; that is, it can
take great weights pressing down on it. But it is poor in tension
(forces pressing against its length). So, when you poured the new
floor, it followed the contours of the old floor, and since the old
floor was cracked because of unevenness in the substructure, the
new layer did exactly the same thing. Even if you put in
reinforcing bars or mesh, it could have happened the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Normally this would not be harmful, but to make it waterproof
for use as an animal shelter, something else must be done.
</P>
<P>
   You have a choice:
</P>
<P>
   --Put down wire-mesh reinforcing secured to the new concrete,
then add an inch or so of mortar. After that sets, put down ceramic
tiles with thin-set mortar. A good mason can make that mortar layer
smooth, level, and even, so you could use large (12-inch square)
tiles. If the mortar bed is not that even, then use smaller tiles,
which would be less likely to crack from tension.
</P>
<P>
   --Remove the 3 inches of new concrete, secure the wire mesh to
the old surface, then mortar and tile as above.
</P>
<P>
   --Remove all the concrete and lay a new slab, with reinforcing
bars or mesh.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My oil burner is leaking a bit of oil under the outside
casing. There is just a little on the floor, but I know that should
not happen. My oil man replaced several parts, but the leak
continues. I have a service contract, so the work did not cost me
anything. What else can I do?
</P>
<P>
   ANNOYED WITH LEAK
</P>
<P>
   A. Keep the service man coming back until the thing is fixed.
Small leaks have a habit of becoming bigger, and with oil, any leak
is a hazard, especially to the environment. Oil dealers are well
aware of this hazard, so yours should continue to seek a solution.
</P>
<P>
   The leak sounds as if it is coming from the line from the tank
to the burner. Tightening the connections may be all that is
needed. Or, replace the line. Or, as a last resort, replace the
line and burner. That burner should work right and not leak. Don't
take less for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have no kitchen disposal, and made a bad decision when I
poured dried dog food down the sink. When I added water, brother,
did it ever clog up. I tried an auger and Liquid Plumber, which
helped a bit, but not entirely. I unscrewed a bolt at the bottom of
the trap under the sink, and felt no debris, but the drain is still
cloggged. Help!
</P>
<P>
   S.B., Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You had the same problem Horatio Hornblower had with his
first independent command, a cargo ship damaged and captured in a
battle and given to Hornblower to take back to England. Except the
cargo was rice, which expanded horrendously when it got wet from
the shot holes in the hull, eventually tearing the ship apart and
sinking her. Poor Hornblower; he lost his first command.
</P>
<P>
   You may not lose your ship, but the dog food did the same thing
as Hornblower's rice, expanding when you added water and plugging
the drain. An auger or snake will clear it, and since you already
cleared the drain above the trap, now stick the auger farther down
the drain, through the hole in the trap. Physical removal is the
only way.
</P>
<P>
   Since our first conversation, S.B. called back to say she
cleared the blockage and water is flowing again, but the substitute
brass bolt she bought to close the trap hole is leaking slightly.
To fix that leak, try this: Back off the bolt a bit and put a bead
of adhesive caulk around it, just under the head, then snug down
the bolt again. This will compress the caulk to make a watertight
seal (we hope).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am building an 11-by-13-foot sun room on a block foundation
and plan to put bricks on the dirt floor. How should I do that, and
should I polyurethane the brick?
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD SOLOSKI, Magnolia, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. First of all, do not polyurethane the brick; brick should be
left bare. Or, you could seal the brick with a clear sealer. For
your purposes, dig down deeply enough to put in 6 inches of crushed
stone, then 2 inches of stone dust as a bed for the brick. Tamp it
down as compactly as you can, smooth it out, then apply the bricks
very close to one another, so they are touching.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing. If you plan to use the brick as a heat sink
(letting the bricks warm up from the sun so that they will release
their heat when the sun goes down), you have to put 2-to-4 inches
of styrofoam insulation under the crushed stone; otherwise the
bricks will conduct the sun's heat into the ground instead of
retaining it for release when the sun goes down.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's a good idea to put the insulation under the
crushed stone anyway, in case you ever want to convert the room
into heated living space.

FROM IMPERFECT KITTENS TO WHEN TO MENTION SEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From time to time, this column answers selected readers'
questions. Please send yours to Barbara F. Meltz, The Boston Globe,
Box 2378, Boston, MA 02107-2378; fax 617-929-2813 or e-mail
meltz(at)globe.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our cat had a litter of kittens, including one born with
clubfoot. No one will adopt it. Since this kitten is not really
sick but has a deformity that keeps it from walking, my instinct is
to put it to sleep. But how do I tell that to my kids, 10 and 8?
Should we keep it, even though that doesn't seem like a good
solution for the kitten? I want my children to be sensitive but not
unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   A. You're right to sense this is a tricky issue; whatever you do
sends a message to your children about how much you, and by
extension society, value living things when they are less than
perfect. But there are more options available than you may realize,
according to educator Judith A. Skretny of Life Transitions Center
in Buffalo, N.Y. For instance:
</P>
<P>
   --Surgery. Although costly, surgical repair has been known to be
successful for cats with clubfoot.
</P>
<P>
   --Adaption. A kitten may need help getting around, but grown
cats are often able to lead active lives with just three legs by
learning to compensate for the disability.
</P>
<P>
   --Adoption. Skretny suggests trying to find an adoptive family
by working through your vet or a local animal rescue league. ``Many
people will take a disabled pet,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you do, include your children in conversation about the
choices, although don't leave the ultimate decision to them.
``That's too much responsibility for children of any age,
especially if you are considering euthanasia,'' says Skretny, who
lectures nationally on death and dying with the American Academy of
Bereavement.
</P>
<P>
   Because children have great affinity to animals, they may opt to
keep it without realizing the effort that entails. Include a visit
and discussion with the vet with the kids and the kitten before you
finalize a decision. If they want surgery, for instance, the vet
can give you an idea of the cost and recovery. Then a discussion
for your family may include ways in which the children can earn
money to help pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are so many options for this kitten, Skretny does
not advocate killing it. ``Do you euthanize something just because
it's imperfect?'' she asks. She notes this is very different from a
decision a family must make when an older, sick or infirm, and much
beloved pet needs to be put down. (Look for a fuller discussion of
this in a future Child Caring column.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We found your recent column against spanking (Feb. 4) very
helpful, especially what you said about matching expectations to a
child's temperament and stage of development. Can you give us ideas
about how to keep our Mother's Day celebration from turning into a
disaster? My mother-in-law is coming from Michigan. We want to take
her someplace special but our son, who is 5, doesn't do well in
restaurants (he's very physical and active) and we usually end up
angry and exasperated. We've spanked once, and it was over his
behavior in a public place.
</P>
<P>
   A. Matching expectations to temperament and development means
not expecting more from a child than he is capable of, so you're
right to worry that a meal in a fancy restaurant might be a
disaster with a 5-year-old who has a hard time sitting still.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean you can't do it, though. By feeding into his
strengths, you might be able to take preventive measures to make
this meal _ or any similar situation _ work, says Roni Leiderman, a
psychologist in Fort Lauderdale and director of the Family Center
at Nova Southeastern University there.
</P>
<P>
   It will take effort, however. A few days beforehand, talk about
the event and give him some idea of what to expect: ``Since Grandma
is coming all the way from Michigan, we want to do something
special for Mother's Day. We're thinking about taking her to a
fancy restaurant.'' Describe in detail what makes this restaurant
different from others he's been to: ``It's very quiet in this
restaurant, not like McDonald's where you can talk loudly.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, show him that you understand what makes him
tick and that you're going to help him manage: ``We know how hard
it is for a boy your age to sit still for a long time, so we'll
bring some surprise activities that will be fun for you to do right
there at the restaurant table.'' Does your child have some
interests that hold his attention? Dinosaurs? Pirates? Find a new
book, bring along markers and paper and other activities. The more
options you have, the better.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, pay close attention. ``Heading off a meltdown
depends on reading cues before he falls apart, so he never gets to
the end of his rope,'' says Leiderman. Sometimes that means leaving
the restaurant altogether but it can also mean providing a break in
the activity when he first gets antsy. Take him outside for a walk
around the block or something else physical. Make a game of it;
this shouldn't be punitive.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, says Leiderman, be sure to reinforce good behavior:
``What a good job you're doing of sitting still at the table!'' &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My 10-year-old son is not showing any interest in things
sexual but many of his friends are. Should I wait for him to bring
up the subject of sex before I give him some books about it? What
books would you recommend?
</P>
<P>
   A. Absolutely don't wait for him to bring it up, says Debra
Haffner, president of SIECUS (Sexuality, Information and Education
Council of the U.S.). You could wait forever, because so many kids
are too embarrassed or intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look for the teachable moment,'' says Haffner. It could be
anything, from lyrics to a song on the radio _ ``What do you think
about what that song says about girls?'' _ to seeing a pregnant
woman in the store: ``Seeing that woman makes me think you're old
enough to wonder about these things. Do you have any questions
about how a woman gets pregnant?'' Conversations don't need to be
long or involved, shouldn't be lectures, but should offer
opportunity for your child to ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   Three books Haffner recommends:
</P>
<P>
   --``It's Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Sex and Sexual
Health,'' by Robie H. Harris (1994, Penguin).
</P>
<P>
   --``The `What's Happening to My Body?' for Girls/for Boys,'' by
Lynda Madaras (l993) Newmarket Press.
</P>
<P>
   Preface giving a book by saying, ``I notice some of your friends
are going through puberty and you will, too, soon. I hope you look
at these books when you have some questions, and that you'll feel
free to ask me any questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Haffner reminds that sex education happens little by little.
``It's not a conversation you only have once,'' she says. SIECUS
has a Web site (www.siecus.org) where parents can pose questions

   Q. Your article on disappointment (Feb. 11) hit home big time
for us. Our child is applying to private school (third grade) for
the first time. What advice do you have about preparing her for the
potential disappointment of not getting in?
</P>
<P>
   A. How disappointed she will or won't be depends largely on you,
says educator Janine Bempechat of Harvard Graduate School of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   Before you hear from the school, ``Keep your own anxiety in
check,'' she says. Talk about it as an interesting option you may
or may not want to do even if she gets accepted: ``They get to
decide if they have enough room for you to go, and we get to decide
if that's what we want.'' Keep comparisons of her present school to
a minimum: ``Just because we're applying doesn't mean we don't like
your school now. We do; each school has advantages. Mostly, we like
the idea of having choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't over-talk about it. ``At this age,'' Bempechat says,
``there's no reason to get into the concept that selections are
based on how smart a child is. Even if a third-grader senses that's
part of it, they don't know it in the same way an older child does,
and they certainly don't attach any significance to it, in terms of
the future.'' If she doesn't get in, Bempechat urges a
matter-of-fact approach: ``There wasn't enough room this year. If
you really liked it, we can try again next year, if you want.''
</P>
<P>
   For older kids, it's harder. ``By sixth grade, they know it's
based on qualifications,'' says Bempechat, who is author of
``Against All Odds: How `At-Risk' Students Exceed Expectations''
(Jossey-Bass). For their parents, her advice is to downplay the
smartness factor: `` `You throw your hat into the ring and it
depends on who else is applying at the same time. If you don't get
in, it's not necessarily that you weren't smart enough, but that
other kids were just as smart and the school values something they
have that you don't, like a musical talent.'''
</P>
<P>
   With a disappointment like this, Bempechat urges talking about
the life lesson to be learned: Wherever you are in life, there are
people who do better than you and some who do worse.
</P>

THE SHEER DELIGHT OF BEING FABRIC ARTIST PETER FASANO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARGO MILLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREAT BARRINGTON, Mass. _ Designer Peter Fasano, his
paint-smeared sweatshirt a Niagara of colors, walks a bolt of sheer
linen fabric over to a glass door. He unfurls an armful of the
material till the sunlight plays through it, leaving the design _
an opulent arabesque of leaves _ in silhouette. Then he &UR;  &LR; walks the
linen back to a long worktable and spreads it out. What was sheer
in the design is now opaque. What was airy is now static. What had
flirted with the outdoors will seal it off. Fasano strokes the
pattern flat so it reveals bits of gold paint riding the curves.
This same bolt of linen is now the stuff of formal interiors, a bit
dulled under artificial light, mannerly but not heavy. Fasano
grins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheers,'' he says, ``are always changing with the light.'' The
grin becomes a laugh. ``Sheers are the chameleons of curtains.''
</P>
<P>
   Fasano designs wallpapers and material for curtains. Leading
decorators seek him out for their hush-hush clients _ a CEO in Napa
Valley, a country club in Kentucky Bluegrass Country, tax exiles in
Florida. With a small crew, Fasano produces all he designs, mostly
by the silk-screen process. But what he likes doing best is to
paint directly on fabric. An hour in his company is to know the
delights of the unexpected. He loves telling about the happy
accident. He's got tales about the suggestion someone else made,
which made his design that much better. He adds motifs: Monkeys
acquire palm trees. He subtracts: Lose the flower but keep the
plaid. He inserts: Rivers of color flow between columns of black
knots. He borrows: That grid of little white dots ought to remind
you of the penny candy you peel from shiny paper. That's where he
got the idea. The difference: ``No paper in your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   It all started in New York City in 1972, where Fasano moved
after his Vietnam service. The GI Bill had paid his tuition at
Parsons School of Design, but life wasn't all window treatments and
shag carpeting. With Kent State and Vietnam on their minds, a lot
of young people like Fasano were caught up in various movements to
cure society's ills. ``We were very environmentally conscious at
Parsons, especially David Easton, who was an interior designer for
Parrish/Hadley,'' Fasano recalled in an interview the other day.
The idea was to see if changing bad environments through good
design would help. ``I worked on designing prisons and mental
hospitals. I wanted to see if good three-dimensional design would
lower the rate of recidivism.'' But the difference between a
well-presented student thesis and testable results is money.
``There was just never any money around to see if we were right,''
Fasano says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He had to support himself, and a Parsons degree was entree to
the likes of decorator Dorothy Draper. But after a year-and-a-half
of cosseting her clients, Fasano found out interior design wasn't
for him. He still had a few dollars left from the GI Bill, so he
went to the Art Students League in New York. He'd always known he
liked working on surfaces. Now he tacked a canvas square, 6 feet by
6, to the floor of his Manhattan loft and let the paint talk. ``I
loved this more than life itself,'' he says. Patterns were his
thing. ``I was a pattern painter before the word existed.'' His
timing was good. Minimalism was just coming in. The buzz names were
Agnes Martin and Eva Hesse. Abstract Expressionism also grabbed
Fasano. He had a new war to fight, pitting the spatter curves of
Jackson Pollock against the straight edges of Kenneth Nolan. What
was happening in the art galleries was not lost on a decorator like
Albert Hadley. He began using painted fabrics for interiors, some
designed by Fasano, and Fasano's future was secure.
</P>
<P>
   He was lucky. His talent for pattern might have doomed him to a
career in fashion designing scarves. But he saw that as a dead end.
``Fashion changes every two months. They want it `Monday,' and they
want it in thousands of yards. Then you've got to top that. Fabric
designed for interiors has a much longer life. You can design from
a point of view. Your ideas can evolve.''
</P>
<P>
   So Fasano spent a couple of very happy years living in a cheap
uptown loft in the Carnegie Hill section of Manhattan painting in
the mornings and designing in the afternoons. About this time,
Elizabeth Hamilton, the woman who would become his wife, was
walking her blonde good looks through Grand Central Station and a
spy from Glamour asked if she'd like to model for the magazine. So
she did that till she fell in love with word processing. She was so
good at teaching herself she went into a career teaching others.
``She'd much rather read a computer manual than see herself in a
magazine,'' says her husband fondly. In 1982, when the stock market
began going up, Fasano laid down his paintbrushes and went full
time into fabric painting. He worked at home on an 18-yard table of
his own design. The stuff was free form _ silk-screening would come
later _ and he would turn out 5,000 to 8,000 yards a year. The
actress Dina Merrill loved one particular spatter print so much
that 15 years later when it began to look a little tired she asked
Fasano to duplicate it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a master plan,'' says Fasano, ``and I still
don't. We operate by controlled anarchy.'' You wouldn't guess that
from the tranquil order of his studio workshop just south of the
Great Barrington fairgrounds, where on a half-mile track slow
horses will always beat slower horses and the old town, despite the
gentrification of the main drag, delights Fasano for its ``perfect
mix of blue collar and white collar.'' He and Hamilton moved here
in June 1990 with their son, Nicolas, now 12. ``We thought it would
be fun to live in the country,'' Fasano says. They had known the
Connecticut foothills of the Berkshires from visits to friends.
Moving from Manhattan was ``not the culture shock you might
expect,'' Hamilton says. She had grown up in Milton and Orleans.
``We're New Englanders at heart,'' says her husband.
</P>
<P>
   And with Great Barrington came the discovery of golf. It's
Fasano's other passion. Also a sudden reminder of his own
mortality. He drops the name of Tiger Woods, actually Woods's
decorator ``who's a good friend,'' and then says: ``I'm probably 30
years older than Tiger Woods and for the first time in my life I
realize I'm not going to see his entire career. I'll be dead not
knowing the end of his story.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first six years in Great Barrington, Fasano worked at
home. More studio than house, he suggests. Then an old mill
building right on Route 7 became available. Fasano built onto the
footprint and could finally move his four 32-yard-long worktables
into an evironmentally friendly shop. Other designers tease him it
doesn't stink like a print works. In part, he says, because the
acrylics in those hundreds of mustard-squeeze bottles they use to
paint with is all water-based.
</P>
<P>
   One day a month Fasano is on the road visiting one of the 15
decorator showrooms that ``rep'' (represent) him by carrying his
fabrics and wallpapers for the delectation of interior designers.
At the Boston Design Center, it's David Webster of Webster &AMP; Co.
Ltd. Fasano's sheers retail for about $40 a yard, printed canvas
about $80, and painted tafetta about $90. Wallpapers are about $65
a roll. Webster likes Fasano for his colors and textures, his
patterns (checkerboards, stripes, grids), and his ``creative funky
look.'' One popular print even dares to co-opt that awesome symbol
of atomic power, a nucleus with orbiting electrons, and by
miniaturizing it makes you smile. There's no one Fasano customer,
Webster insists. ``Well, his stuff does go very well with painted
furniture, with things that are not terribly serious.''
</P>
<P>
   But most days, Fasano is to be found on the floor of his shop
and Hamilton in the little corner office seeing to the business
end. Their old dog, a black Lab/coon hound mix named Calvin, lies
in the doorway. Fasano does of course have a business strategy and
that is to stay flexible. He can turn out goods by the hundreds of
yards. But he's also one of the few who can, and will gladly, fill
an order for a minimum of 10 yards. And, yes, like the fashion
industry, they do want it ``Monday.'' Fasano relishes telling about
a recent order that reached him on a Tuesday, was designed and
faxed the next day, produced on Thursday, and samples shipped FedEx
before Friday noon. Sprints like these keep Fasano and his crew on
their toes. He thinks variety makes for a happy shop.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One recent morning, two men walked a paint trough slowly over a
table-length of raw silk from China, coloring it a warm beige
called Wedgwood Drab. A few years ago, Fasano could silk-screen his
popular monkey print called Coconut Grove right on this drab. Then
the silk started arriving lighter in shade. Did the silkworm diet
change? Fasano doesn't know. Another shop might choose to dye the
fabric. Fasano always prefers paint. Paint, he says, sits on the
surface, plays with light, sets the picture off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coconut Grove is a huge seller for us. Very popular in Florida
but not in Hawaii where they don't seem to like monkeys.'' The
print is appealing, the monkeys sweet without being cartoonish.
``If you can get people to smile, you've won them over,'' says
Fasano. It takes four separate screenings to bring Coconut Grove to
life. Most people will see only the little brown monkeys and their
perky palm trees. But Fasano also screens on other bits of flora
and fauna, red here, yellow there. If they register at all on the
customer it will be for their throwaway whimsy. But the designer
knows they serve a more serious purpose, and that is to make the
pattern dance. The last step requires the business end of a
squeegee dipped in brown paint. Daub-daub, goes the squeegee.
Daub-daub-daub. From each of the palm trees now hang two or three
hand-painted coconuts. If silk-screened, these would lie flat. But
the paint has set up another, competing rhythm _ ``real'' fruit in
an imaginary jungle.

MISSPEAKING WORDS OF WISDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston broadcaster David Brudnoy notwithstanding, it's always
Celtic with a soft C, says Charles Harrington Elster. On this side
of the Atlantic it's never Keltic, unless it's spelled that way, as
in Keltic Krust bakery (in Newton, Mass.)
</P>
<P>
   Brudnoy enjoys twitting sports fans with the hard C version of
Celtics. According to Elster, this makes the talk show host
something of a quodlibetarian, ``a pedantic blowhard who engages in
elaborate arguments about theoretical fine points.'' Elster should
know. He says he's a quodlibetarian himself.
</P>
<P>
   Elster's new book, ``The Beastly Big Book of
Mispronunciations,'' sheds light upon the American pronunciation of
hundreds of words. It's not meant to be read straight through,
Elster said from his home in San Diego, but used as a reference and
argument-settler _ or argument-starter. His opinions about the word
``aunt'' are fighting words in this part of the world. He says the
only proper pronunciation is ``ant.'' Obviously he doesn't know
everything.
</P>
<P>
   His book, however, is engaging enough to invite front-to-back
reading because Elster is such a captivating writer, armed with a
seemingly endless store of language-related trivia and a host of
violent opinions. His fulminations are marvelous. For instance he
writes that the pervasive mispronunciation of the word bulimia
(correctly ``byoo-LIM-ee-uh'') ``proves yet again that human
stupidity is rampant at all levels of speech, from the most
ignorant, beastly mispronouncer to the most erudite, self-important
egghead. What is wrong with everybody, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   On the phone Elster seems less fierce than he does on the page,
even willing to concede that in certain cases, popular usage has
superseded correct pronunciation. Take the word grimace, for
example. ``I am probably the only person in America who pronounces
it gri-MACE,'' he said. ``The MACE should rhyme with place.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimace is one of several words Elster says he's just about
given up on. Bulimia is another. Loath _ rhymes with both _ is a
problem too because so many people confuse its meaning (unwilling)
and pronunciation with loathe (to hate). Lingerie, he says, is a
lost cause. ``When I pronounce it correctly, lan-zhe-REE, people
don't know what I'm talking about. So now I say `women's
underwear.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Elster's book is instructive, unless you're an omnierudite
pedant. I stand corrected about any number of words. Mauve, for
example. It's always been ``mahwv'' to me, but the correct
pronunciation rhymes with stove. That's a fairly common mistake,
Elster said, because people assume mauve and suave should sound
alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Book of Beastly Mispronunciations'' includes plenty of
examples of why it should be a required reference for anyone who
speaks before the public. Elster monitors radio and television for
beastly mispronunciations by those who should know better. He's
rounded up some humdingers. Dan Rather incorrectly stressing
``spy'' in respiratory (correctly ``RES-pur-uh-TOR-ee''). Sister
Wendy, ``public TV's winsome, wimpled art critic,'' wrongly
stressing the second syllable of Medici, instead of the first
(correctly ``MED-i-chee''). A number of public figures saying
``nucular'' instead of nuclear, or in President Carter's case,
``noo-kee-ur.'' Former congressman William Dannemeyer's pronouncing
``anal'' as if it rhymes with channel. Elster even catches The New
York Times language expert William Safire stumbling, pronouncing
chimera as ``shimmera.'' (it's ``ky-MEER-uh'' or ``ki-MEER-uh''.)
</P>
<P>
   Elster and Richard Lederer, author of ``Crazy English'' and
other popular books about language, cohost a call-in program, ``A
Way With Words,'' on the San Diego public radio station. Elster
says they have hopes of syndication, someday, maybe someday soon.

``trust'' is only one aspect of governing. By MARIANNE MEANS.

A DAY OF WAXING AND WANING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've been trying to wax my kitchen floor.
</P>
<P>
   I know that millions of women accomplish this task every day
without trauma. It doesn't take extraordinary intelligence, or
unusual persistence, or superhuman strength. It's a simple act of
physical labor.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   I started yesterday. I actually had my cleaning lady wash the
floor so I had only to finish what she started. All I had to do was
spread the wax on the cork tiles with a sponge. Right? Not miss any
spots. OK, I can do that. Keep the dog from stepping on the floor
while it was wet. Duh.
</P>
<P>
   How hard could it be?
</P>
<P>
   I lifted up the throw rugs I had secured to the floor with
double-sided tape. What a mess! It was sticky and yucky, spatula-
and Brillo-resistant. No cleaning product I had made even a dent.
After my efforts, the glue was also hairy and caked with foam. I
headed out to the hardware store to get advice. Because I'm trying
to be well-organized, before I went I checked to see that I had a
decent mop and a can of liquid wax. Stupidly, I congratulated
myself on my ability to think ahead. I came back from the store
with a bottle of Goo Gone and after 30 minutes of pouring, waiting,
and scrubbing, the floor was smooth and clean.
</P>
<P>
   I squirted wax on the floor, noticing for the first time that
the can was only one-third full. Oh-oh, I'd have to get more. I
mopped with the waxer, noticing for the first time that one of the
screws was loose, making the sponge wiggle out of alignment. Oh-oh,
I'd have to fix that.
</P>
<P>
   I went to my husband's workroom, looking for a nut that would
fit on a plastic protuberance. Three coffee cans of screws and nuts
and bolts later, I acknowledged it was hopeless. I'd have to run
out to the store again, but my pocketbook was on the window seat
and yes, I'd waxed the floor in front of it. Five long minutes
later, I set off into the night.
</P>
<P>
   The hardware store was closed.
</P>
<P>
   I began again the next morning, having purchased adequate tools.
The first coat was beautiful, but halfway through the second coat,
the wax looked milky in spots. Reading the label, I realized I'd
shaken the new can when the instructions said, ``For the smoothest
shine and best results, do not shake.'' I reeled with the thought
that I might have to spend the rest of the day removing the wax I'd
just applied. All I could do was hope the cloudiness would
disappear when the wax dried. I waited on the unwaxed portion of
the kitchen floor, my fingers crossed.
</P>
<P>
   Then I noticed tiny spots of paint the grandkids had gotten on
the lower kitchen cabinets. The upper ones weren't that spotless,
either. How come I hadn't seen the cobwebs behind the chest in the
corner? When did that grime on the radiators arrive? I saw a light
smudge on one painted wall. I observed the scuff marks under the
window seat. I got down on my hands and knees and at floor level
peered in all four directions.
</P>
<P>
   I got up, wishing I hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   I could feel the compulsion to make everything perfect coming
on, the way it always does when I start to clean. Suddenly my brain
awakens and I'm no longer blind to the chaos engulfing me. I knew
if I opened the refrigerator and looked in, my eyes would be
offended. I knew if I opened my silverware drawer, my stomach would
turn. I wanted to scrub the tile behind the stove with a
toothbrush, pull out a can of paint and freshen the woodwork, run
outside and wash my windows.
</P>
<P>
   I was, of course, also afraid I'd do what I usually do when I'm
overwhelmed by housework _ go upstairs and read a book.
</P>
<P>
   I looked down at the floor. The wax had dried to a clear glossy
finish. I wanted to shout with joy. I wanted to kiss the dog, who
was outside whining pitifully, having been put on her run for a
crime she hadn't yet committed. No matter. The floor was gleaming.
I had rubber mats to slip under the rugs. For the next two hours, I
scrubbed and wiped and polished and organized until the kitchen
looked passable, even to me.
</P>
<P>
   By the time my husband came home, I had no energy left to make
dinner. Jack volunteered to make lamb chops, but as he lifted them
out of the oven, the practical joker who sneers at all my attempts
to create order in my life, knocked the sizzling broiler pan out of
his hand.
</P>
<P>
   On. To. My. Newly. Waxed. Floor.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. I'll. Do. It. Again. Tomorrow.

IRISES ARE AS SUBLIME AS THEY ARE TOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Irises are elegance. Their swordlike leaves serve as season-long
architectural elements in the border. Their relatively short-lived
flowers are sublime.
</P>
<P>
   That's certainly why I grow some. (Also, they are named for
Iris, the goddess of the rainbow, as is my mom.) Another reason I
grow them is that their 200 species include some of the easiest to
grow perennials, especially the Siberians. These are beardless,
which means their falls are not well-fuzzed or furry. The falls are
the three sepals, petal-like structures, which tend to droop. The
standards are the three petals, which are upright.
</P>
<P>
   Before buying my first Siberian iris, I consulted Wyman's
Gardening Encyclopedia, whose iris entry was written by Beatrice
Clark Warburton, the noted iris authority and hybridizer. She
wrote: ``The Siberian group of garden iris is the most dependable
of all iris types. They will grow whereever any iris may be grown,
without any particular care, and offer a choice of plants with
robust manners or with more delicate ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Marty Schafer of Carlisle, Mass. also consulted ``Bee''
Warburton, but he did it directly and came away with the stock with
which he began an ambitious Siberian iris breeding program.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer got into gardening in 1980 when, while ``courting my
girl,'' he and she were given a box of vegetable and flower seeds
by one of her roommates, who happened to be a seed salesman. (More
proof that life is a mysterious circle.) The seeds were old, so
mainly flowers came up. ``We became hooked on flowers'' and, later,
irises in particular, he told me recently. Today, Schafer and the
woman he courted, Jan Sacks, grow flowers for the wholesale
cut-flower market and hybridize Siberian irises.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was something about irises that really excited me,''
especially Siberians, Schafer explained. ``They're very adapted to
New England. They're tough, and they don't rot. They go dormant in
winter, which most bearded irises don't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Siberians will take a bit of shade and withstand some drought,
which is what won me over. Well, maybe it was the new pastels,
outstanding flowers, on the market now. Growing next to
tradescantia and Campanula carpatica I have `Orville Fay' (blue,
darker veins), `Lavender Bounty' (lavender falls, lighter
standards, early), and `Butter &AMP; Sugar' (butter yellow, white
standards).
</P>
<P>
   Schafer and Sacks have gone far beyond those and, so far,
through their Joe Pye Weed's Garden, have introduced 26 Siberian
hybrids to the market. They introduced one a year for the first
four years, then two a year for a while, and last year 10. ``I had
a really good year in 1992,'' Schafer said. ``We planted out 8,000
seedlings.''
</P>
<P>
   Schafer does the pollinating, Sacks does the photography, and
they share the other duties. Pollinating is done in June, and seeds
are collected, labeled, and dried in August. The seeds are planted
in October and early November, and they germinate the following
April or early May. About 10 percent flower the first year.
Hybridizing is a long-term affair.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer is pursuing five goals, three color-related: true blues,
true yellows, and combinations known as overlays. He has been using
yellow ``as a tool to pry new things out of the old colors.'' The
pigments are different substances in different areas of the plant,
so they don't mix like paints but are, rather, more like the
separate tiny dots of color in pointillist paintings, such as those
by Seurat. In fact, Schafer said, under a microscope, iris tissues
appear to have small bodies of color suspended in white, but in
normal view, the dots merge into solid color.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer's fourth goal is fragrance. Irises are not known for
fragrance, but there is some, here and there, and Schafer is trying
to develop that, to strengthen it. What do his fragrant Siberians
smell like? Oranges, he said, and while they may never fill a room
with scent the way jasmines do, his hybrids may someday reward us
garden browsers who tend to shove our snouts into such beautiful
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Schafer is intrigued by the iris styles, which are the
stalks arising from the ovaries and holding the stigmas. Schafer
has been breeding them to be more petal-like, smooth, colorful,
pretty in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Pye Weed's Garden is 2 1/2 acres, 1 acre of field-grown
plants, ``and otherwise there's just gardens everywhere.'' (It is
not a nursery open to the public; plants are sold by mail order
from a catalog, available for $2, 337 Acton St., Carlisle, MA
01741.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real neat place we have,'' Schafer said, with lots of
``wonderful rocks here, lichen-encrusted rocks, the bones of New
England sticking up all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Schafer, who is finishing a term as president of the Iris
Society of Massachusetts, clearly recognizes beauty, but then, he
is from a musical family, and his training is in dance and theater.
In his breeding program, he follows his instincts and the plants
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interaction between the plant and the hybridizer,'' he
said. ``It's just amazing where the flowers will lead you.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPECIAL REPORT &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   SOUP-KITCHENS-I (Peekskill, N.Y.) _ A stream of low-wage
workers, retirees and refugees from public-assistance are swelling
the lines at soup kitchens and food pantries across America. Some
are the welfare-to-work versions of an old phenomenon: the working
poor caught in the middle _ too well off for public assistance but
not well enough off to make it on their own. Some are immigrants
who are here legally but were cut off from food stamps under new
federal welfare laws. Some are following a path of least
resistance: rather than jump through hoops designed to tarnish the
appeal of public aid, they are turning to private charities.
Together, they are changing the face of food lines long occupied by
the addicted, the disabled, the generally down-and-out. And they
may help explain a puzzle confronting poverty analysts: Why have
the lines kept growing when unemployment is at its lowest level in
a generation and the economy has remained healthy for years? By
Andrew C. Revkin.

the UAW in 1941, 75,000 home health-care workers are voting today
on whether to join the Service Employees International Union. The
organizing drive reflects labor's new emphasis on low wage,

United States have long aspired to distinguish between paid
advertising and features created by producers or editors with no
objective other than to appeal to their audience. But on the
Internet, with bookstores becoming literary reviews and news
outlets turning into travel agents, it is hard to find a source of
information that does not have a financial stake in what its users
do with what the source publishes. Trusting an Internet site to
navigate the Web is like following a helpful stranger in Morocco
who offers to take you to the best rug store. You may well find
what you're looking for, but your guide will get a piece of
whatever you spend. By Saul Hansell and Amy Harmon.

European Union ordered its member countries to open their telephone

customers at low prices. By Edmund L. Andrews.

DESIGNER NIEDECKEN SHARES THE PEDESTAL WITH WRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone's heard of Frank Lloyd Wright, the greatest of American
architects, as much a legend for his epic ego as for his
revolutionary designs.
</P>
<P>
   But George Mann Niedecken? The name is likely to generate a
response of ``Who?'' among all but connoisseurs of what went inside
Wright's Prairie Style houses.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Robertson aims to fix that. She's raising the profile of
Niedecken, a muralist, interior decorator, and designer of
furniture, lighting fixtures, and carpets, through a new exhibition
she's organized, ``Designing in the Wright Style: Furniture and
Interiors by Frank Lloyd Wright and George Mann Niedecken,'' at the
Museum of Our National Heritage. She's uniquely qualified to act as
Niedecken's champion. He was born in Milwaukee in 1878, died there
in 1945, and based his business there; she, until her 1996 move to
Lexington, was a curator at the Milwaukee Art Museum, where, while
riffling through the archives, she discovered the Niedecken
documents that eventually led to her 1981 retrospective of his work
at that institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intent is not to knock Wright off his pedestal,'' she says
in the fine catalog of her show, ``but rather to include others,
Niedecken as well as (Wright affiliate) Marion Mahony among them,
on it or close by.''
</P>
<P>
   Her show gets at the heart of collaboration in architecture,
which is a collaborative art no matter how hard a Wright tries to
take credit for everything down to the doorknobs. (Wright tried to
downplay Niedecken's contribution in a 1931 Princeton University
lecture in which he proclaimed that decoration ``must be part of
the architect's design in both concept and execution . . . Let
decoration, therefore, die for architecture, and the decorator
become an architect, but not an `interior architect,' '' which was
what Niedecken called himself.)
</P>
<P>
   Robertson also hits at the notion that, as she puts it,
``influence was a one-way affair from Wright to `lesser'
designers.'' She points out that Niedecken spent considerable time
in Europe, in direct contact with the Art Nouveau movement that
influenced Wright, years before Wright went there himself. Wright
knew the work of the Viennese Secessionists and other
forward-thinking artists and architects through publications;
Niedecken, who studied with Art Nouveau designer Alphonse Mucha in
Paris, knew it first-hand _ and brought it back to the American
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robertson can't resist hanging plant drawings by Wright and
Niedecken side by side in her show: Gazing at the slightly clumsy
Wright and the exquisitely sure Niedecken, she asks, with a note of
triumph, ``Now which of the two was the better draftsman?''
</P>
<P>
   She clearly gets a kick out of this, not only because Niedecken
is unsung and not only because he was extremely talented, but also
because he was apparently a really nice guy, gentle, and easygoing,
``which is why he could work with Wright,'' she notes.
</P>
<P>
   Their personalities were opposites; their design styles, while
distinct, harmonized. Robertson opens with rooms that explain those
styles, showing what the two men were up to before they first
worked together in the early years of this century. Wright's room
comes first, with a model of the 1902 Ward Willits house that
epitomizes the Prairie Style. A building that spreads in all four
directions, capped by a sheltering roof, it was ``the beginning of
ranch houses,'' the curator notes, as well as a signal of the
preeminence of the horizontal line meant to echo that of the
Midwestern plains. Then comes a lineup of Wright's iconic chairs,
heavy and severe, the flickering grain of the oak their sole
ornament, one permitted only because it was internal rather than
superimposed. Wright's most famous chair, the extremely tall one
meant for dining, was not meant for comfort. It demanded perfect
posture, and the height of its seat meant maybe your feet wouldn't
hit the floor. ``Who the hell wants to sit in it?'' Robertson asks.
</P>
<P>
   In the next room, the arms of a Niedecken chair curve in a
welcoming embrace. A cabinet from the Adam Mayer house that
Niedecken decorated between 1904 and 1907 is downright delicate in
proportion, filled with Gruby pottery in that calm, pond-green
color that was the Gruby firm's signature. The bed Niedecken
designed for the Emma Demmer house, which, like Mayer's, was in
Milwaukee, is a room-within-a-room, its massiveness relieved by
long-stemmed flowers cut out of the head- and footboards and a
pattern of squares on the sides. In the Mayer and Demmer houses,
Niedecken designed the stained-glass windows and doors, the carpets
and lamps, even the embroidery details on the upholstery and
curtain fabrics. He achieved the kind of integrated interior, the
merger of architecture, fine and decorative arts, that was an ideal
common to the Secessionist Gesamtkunstwerk, Whistler's Peacock
Room, Frederic Edwin Church's house, Olana _ and Wright.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A photograph of the showrooms Niedecken remodeled in the F.H.
Bresler Co., an art gallery, shows his willingness not to dictate
every detail in every situation, though, his willingness to
acknowledge that people use rooms, they have their own stuff they
want around them, and their homes and businesses aren't merely the
fulfillment of a design theory. Niedecken's sleekly curving
cabinets in the Bresler gallery are topped by accessories in
varying styles, and traditional paintings hang on the walls.
Wright, such a control freak that he made his furniture so heavy
that it would be difficult for clients to move it around after he
left the scene, would have tossed it all out. Bresler was evidently
pleased: He became a silent partner in the decorating firm
Niedecken formed in 1907 with his businessman brother-in-law, John
Walbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Niedecken and Wright shared a passion for the deliberate
flatness and calm of Japanese prints, which both collected, and
which influenced the murals Niedecken did for Wright and led him to
put stylized pine cones on draperies in one Wright house. Botanical
imagery played an important part in the nature-inspired design of
Art Nouveau, Arts and Crafts, and the Prairie Style, but it was
nature ``conventionalized,'' as artists of the era put it. Botany
played a part in the first documented collaboration between Wright
and Niedecken, the Susan Dana house in Springfield, Ill., where, in
1904, Niedecken designed and painted a gorgeous dining-room frieze,
with stylized sumac, goldenrod, and purple asters, ``what you'd see
on a Midwestern roadside in autumn,'' Robertson says. In the
evening, Wright's art glass fixtures cast shadows in the shapes of
flickering butterflies on Niedecken's fresco.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration continued in projects including the May and
Robie houses, with Niedecken designing dining chairs for the May
house that were tall but also tapered, graceful as opposed to the
assertiveness of a Wright design. The harmony and warmth of the May
dining room make it one of the collaborators' greatest moments.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After finishing only a preliminary design for the Irving house
in Decatur, Ill., Wright bolted to Europe with his mistress, the
wife of a former client, leaving associates in charge of his
practice _ and Niedecken in charge of the Irving interiors.
Niedecken's combination couch, table, and desk _ one of the oddest
objects in Robertson's show _ is also one of the most massive. With
its shifting horizontal planes, it looks like a Wright house, the
embodiment of Wright's principle that furniture be architecture. It
is more monumental and architectural than any furniture Wright
himself would turn out until the 1930s, though. And, says
Robertson, ``It comes apart. It's a prototype of sectional
furniture, an idea not developed until much later.''
</P>
<P>
   When Wright returned from Europe, he ignored most of his former
associates. Niedecken was an exception. Together, they worked
during World War I on the Bogk and Allen houses, their last
collaborations, and ones where Niedecken's refinements included
beveled edges and cross-grained veneers, hardly Wright-like
touches.
</P>
<P>
   In 1918, they parted ways, Neidecken to focus on elegant
interpretations of the past, Wright to look to the future. The
architect who had depended on a host of other artists eliminated
Neidecken and his painstakingly painted murals and costly custom
furnishings. Wright went on to design affordable ``Usonian''
houses, where the furniture was supposed to be do-it-yourself.

OUR RATING: 3 STARS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The story of making ``Windhorse'' probably would
be a better movie than the actual product here. The picture at
hand, though, has its pluses.
</P>
<P>
   First the background. Longtime documentarian Paul Wagner, who
won an Oscar for the ethnographic film ``The Stone Carvers,'' got
upset after a niece, Julia Elliott, was detained by Chinese
authorities in Tibet and decided to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   With Elliott and her Tibetan boyfriend Thupten Tsering (he
cooked up a script) clandestinely shot some footage in Tibet's
capital, Lhasa, on a high-definition video handicam and even
secretly cast a bunch of locals (many of the credits, including one
of the three main character's, are simply listed as Name Withheld
to protect the performers from communist government reprisals).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the movie was filmed in neighboring Nepal with members
of the Tibetan exile community. The result, Wagner claims, is the
first feature film made in authentic Tibetan and Chinese dialects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windhorse'' itself is a simplistic but enjoyably angry piece
of propaganda. Its characters are more representations than fully
rounded human beings, but they nonetheless come off more like real
people than the devout, stoic sufferers Western films such as
``Seven Years in Tibet'' love to idealize. The Tibetans portrayed
here are individually ambitious, dissolute, religious (but hardly
serene), or filled with hatred for the Chinese communists who've
occupied their country since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The main characters are a brother and a sister. Dolkar (Dadong)
is a pretty pop singer whose Chinese boyfriend Duan-ping (Richard
Chang) introduces her to political honcho Du (Lu Yu), who is going
to give her a big recording contract _ provided she sings Mao's
praises at her first recording session. Dorjee (Jampa Kelsang), is
a billiards-playing wastrel who drinks too much and argues with his
freedom-minded friends that it's futile peacefully resisting
Beijing's rule.
</P>
<P>
   Their cousin Pema (name withheld) is a Buddhist nun who gets
arrested for protesting in the Lhasa marketplace. This places
Dolkar's career and Dorjee's disillusionment in jeopardy,
especially after an American tourist (Taije Silverman) expresses
interest in Tibetan ways in general and him in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner presents his story with both a heavy hand and,
incongruously, a light touch (maybe it's a Zen thing). Dolkar and
Dorjee all too obviously stand for the dangers of assimilation and
despair; every communist, even the token nice guy, is a rigid
rule-lover, and most of them chain smoke to boot; though Wagner
holds off on graphic brutality through much of the film, it's only
a matter of time before the cattle prods come out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the actors nicely underplay their potentially shrill roles,
and the film devotes lots of time to detailed observation of both
traditional and contemporary aspects of Tibetan life. And while its
populist appeal to righteous indignation may be crude, it gives
``Windhorse'' a humanizing energy that both transcends cultural
barriers and exerts a surprising, involving appeal.

THREE GET SIX MONTHS FOR TOSSING PIES AT MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MACKENZIE WARREN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Three people convicted of hurtling pies into the
face of Mayor Willie Brown got what prosecutors believe to be their
just desserts: six months in jail, the maximum possible punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're insane, your honor,'' defendant Gerard Livernois, 34,
of San Francisco barked after Superior Court Judge Ernest Goldsmith
issued the sentence Wednesday. Defense lawyers said they would
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Vermeulen, Livernois' court-appointed lawyer, said the
decision was another example of how the three members of the
loosely organized Biotic Baking Brigade have been unfairly targeted
by the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's indicative of the political pressures felt in this
case,'' Vermeulen said.
</P>
<P>
   The three defendants were eligible for reduced jail time if they
had accepted probation. But all three declined that option, saying
their political activism could require them to commit other acts of
civil disobedience, which would violate the terms of their
probation.
</P>
<P>
   Reg Smith, spokesman for District Attorney Terence Hallinan,
said, ``Mr. Hallinan is disappointed the defendants declined
probation. In our system ... that means the sentence is up to the
judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, flanked by extra police protection in his first public
appearance after the decision, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith said he had no choice but to render the maximum
sentence because the defendants offered no remorse for their action
and refused probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jail is just a waste of time,'' said Livernois, whose sentence
was delayed two weeks so he can seek medical treatment for a benign
brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Also sentenced to jail were Rahula Janowski, 27, of San
Francisco, and Justin Gross, 27, of Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeulen and defense lawyer Katya Komisaruk have said Brown's
pride and his friendship with Hallinan have obscured justice from
the start of the case.
</P>
<P>
   They said the mayor and the district attorney conspired to
prevent a plea bargain and instead made examples of them. Brown
testified Jan. 13 that he believed all ``criminals,'' the
defendants included, should be used as ``learning tools.''
</P>
<P>
   Komisaruk, who has been arrested 31 times for civil
disobedience, said the case should really have been seen only as
``an act of political theater.''
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant District Attorney Maria Bee insisted throughout
the three-day trial that the case wasn't about free speech or
protests, but about Brown's right to personal safety. She argued
that the three carried out a brutal Nov. 7 attack on Brown that
left him dazed, confused and fearing for his life.
</P>
<P>
   All three were convicted Jan. 19 of battery, but acquitted of
the more serious charge of assault on a public official. They all
testified that their point in the attack on Brown was to use humor
to draw attention to what they said was his failure to help
homeless people.

`SCHOOL OF FLESH' PUTS OLDER WOMAN   IN COMMAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients  on Friday, Feb. 26 or
thereafter ) 
OUR RATING: 3 1/2 STARS  
By  BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Standard romantic roles are reversed quite
exquisitely in the absorbing, sophisticated French film ``The
School of Flesh.'' Based on a Yukio Mishima novel transposed from
postwar Japan to modern-day Paris, it puts a mature woman in charge
of a passionate affair with a beautiful but confused younger man.
</P>
<P>
   Or is she in charge? The thing that makes Benoit Jacquot's film
more than just another gigolo story is its fine understanding of
the moment-to-moment power shifts that define any relationship, but
particularly those fraught with significant age, class, money and
even orientation imbalances. (The adaptation was made by Jacques
Fieschi, who insightfully explored similar issues in his
award-winning script for ``Nelly and Monsieur Arnaud,'' although in
the more traditional, older man/younger woman context.)
</P>
<P>
   Jacquot, whose best-known U.S. release was the acclaimed ``A
Single Girl,'' is also refreshingly upfront about the way great sex
can lead to deeper attachments, even among mismatched lovers who
understand from the start that their affair is not likely to stand
the test of time.
</P>
<P>
   Good as all of these elements are, it is Isabelle Huppert who
makes the whole enterprise work. One of France's greatest
actresses, she reliably paints a superbly modulated portrait of a
smart, successful fashion designer taking an erotic flier she needs
to both control and surrender to.
</P>
<P>
   But there's an extra and very special element Huppert brings to
the role. Her haughty yet achingly vulnerable Dominique's
mannerisms mirror the inscrutable impudence that was Huppert's
trademark when she played young temptresses in the '70s and '80s.
This adds a sublime knowingness to Dominique's interactions with
her own maddening boy toy, not to mention fond memories of such
great Huppert films as ``The Trout'' and ``Loulou.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man, Quentin (Vincent Martinez), likes kickboxing,
video games, hustling and keeping secrets, in no particular order
of preference. Indeed, as Quentin inevitably turns difficult,
Dominique debriefs his former gay lovers while plotting her
counter-tactics. But they're generally as perplexed as she is.
</P>
<P>
   Although he's always trying to see how much he can get away
with, Quentin has his tender, reachable side. And even if she gets
much more deeply involved than she intended to, Dominique has a
reliable emotional compass that always points true north. They do a
dance of fire and ice that's smarter than its somewhat schematic
steps would indicate.
</P>
<P>
   The movie at times handles its complicated gender politics a
little too obviously and awkwardly. But it understands personal
negotiations like a world-class diplomat.

 &HT;    Ray Charles followed his instincts to produce music beloved by
mainstream audiences, paving the way for Civil Rights.
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 28.
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ray Charles has been a part of the nation's culture for so long
that it's easy to take him for granted. He seems to have been
around forever, an ageless Muppet seated on a piano stool, rocking
back and forth in a mask of black sunglasses and carefree grin,
belting out his raspy blues.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, after more than four decades as a hitmaker, it's surprising
how little most people really know about the 69-year-old man behind
those shades. Where did he come from? How did he lose his sight?
And is he really the smiling, ``uh-huh'' hep cat seen in soft drink
commercials and on TV? In this ambitious biography, music
journalist Michael Lydon has rummaged through Charles' mysterious
past as if he were going through the singer's coat pockets, and
what he has discovered is a stunning story of poverty, racism,
greed, sex, wealth, opportunity and power.
</P>
<P>
   From the first, Ray Charles the superstar was never supposed to
happen. Born in 1930 into barefoot poverty in the North Florida
town of Greenville, he was raised in a ``colored'' neighborhood
called Jellyroll, where women washed white people's clothes and men
were largely absent. His mother, Retha, was 16, an orphan taken in
by a local couple. His father was Retha's married guardian. Though
not technically incest, the relationship was scandalous. On top of
it all, Ray was handicapped, losing his sight at age 6 to
congenital glaucoma.
</P>
<P>
   Although neighbors dismissed him to a future ``with a tin cup in
his hand,'' headstrong Charles had different ideas. After leaving
the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind, where he learned to read
music in Braille and bang out tunes on an upright piano,
18-year-old Ray bought a one-way ticket to Seattle on a Trailways
bus. In the Pacific Northwest, the young man found jazz music,
racial tolerance and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   It was Charles' 16-year addiction to the seductive drug that
shaped much of his musical style. Without inhibitions, he ran his
long fingers over the keyboard night after night, fusing the smooth
jazz of the day with the blues, gospel and country of his
childhood. That is the signature sound fans would later hear on the
radio, an absolutely fresh approach in which Charles would take
standard pop melodies such as ``Georgia on My Mind'' or ``America
the Beautiful'' or country tunes like the Don Gibson classic ``I
Can't Stop Loving You'' and wrap them up in blues for a white
audience. In Seattle, Charles also met 15-year-old Quincy Jones,
who would become one of pop music's biggest producers and a
lifelong friend.
</P>
<P>
   Lydon sets the stage for Charles' unlikely ascension to pop
stardom by reminding us how very segregated the music world was in
the late 1940s and early '50s. Routinely, Charles and his bandmates
encountered Jim Crow on the road, in the form of racist cops and
restaurants that had no ``colored'' seating. Record companies
signed artists along racial lines, and radio was split into two
distinct camps: white and black.
</P>
<P>
   The chapters dealing with Charles' professional breakthrough and
rise to fame _ through songs such as ``Hit the Road, Jack'' and
``What'd I Say'' _ are the most compelling. In meticulous detail,
Lydon, a founding editor of Rolling Stone magazine and a musician,
describes how Atlantic Records founders Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry
Wexler encouraged Charles to drop his guard and sing with his
initial abandon. In fact, the breakthrough happened when Charles
recorded the sassy smash hit ``I Got a Woman'' at Atlanta's WGST
studios in November 1954. Lydon writes:
</P>
<P>
   `` `I Got a Woman' '' had hit written all over it. . . . The
record blended elements like a hybrid flower. It had a dancing beat
like a jump blues, but it was built on gospel's `rise to glory'
chords, and the cheerful lyric, infectiously delivered by Ray, gave
that mix a pop music gloss. As a bonus, Ray repeated the title so
often that `I got a woman, way over town' might become a sing-along
line people would plug nickels into the jukeboxes to hear over and
over again. `I Got a Woman' was a record for every happy couple in
America, black, white and in-between.''
</P>
<P>
   That tune became the first of a string of hot sellers for
Charles, who developed a rather hedonistic and self-centered
response to success. Though he made millions, the singer was
incredibly cheap, requiring band members to pay their own room and
board on the road. As soon as he became a star, Charles dumped
Ertegun, Wexler and Atlantic for a contract with the milquetoast
ABC Records. That's when strings began appearing on his songs, as
well as those insipid, white-sounding backup singers (remember the
chorus of ``Georgia on My Mind''?).
</P>
<P>
   Charles also is portrayed as a major misogynist, cultivating a
musical harem of women who fell in love with him but never seemed
to crack his heart. Hardly a chapter goes by in which the singer
hasn't fathered an illegitimate child, picked up a woman or dropped
another one cold. An inside joke in the Charles entourage, which
included female backup singers known as the Raelets, was that ``to
be a Raelet, you have to let Ray.'' Meanwhile, Della, the woman who
would be his wife for 21 years, stayed quietly at home in Los
Angeles, raising three kids and cooking Charles an occasional
Southern meal.
</P>
<P>
   With this quirky private life as a background, Lydon excavates
Charles' musical growth and contribution as thoroughly as an
archaeologist. Every recording session is described in minute
detail, which may become tedious for all but the most hard-core
fan. (Readers might want to consider purchasing the Ray Charles
boxed CD set to use as a tool while reading the book.)
</P>
<P>
   Charles didn't self-destruct like Marvin Gaye did, or take
Elvis' route and become a bloated parody of himself. Rather, now
gray-headed and slightly stooped, the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer
has become a required prop for sweeping moments, growling out
``America'' under a giant flag at presidential inaugurations, or
singing a chill-bump-raising ``Georgia'' at the 1996 Summer Olympic
Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Lydon points out, however, that Charles' contribution to our
culture goes way beyond the hit parade. He didn't march on
Washington or boycott buses, but years before the civil rights
movement, Charles was performing to integrated audiences. The
singer was one of the first to leap from ``race'' radio to the
turntables of affluent whites, not by becoming a clone of
mainstream vocalists (as did Nat ``King'' Cole), but by sticking to
soul. With a smile, he paved the way for people to clap, sing,
celebrate and shout ``hallelujah'' no matter the color of their
skin.

 &HT;    A willing vessel: Smiley gives words free rein
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 28.
 &HT;    By Teresa K. Weaver
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't look for Jane Smiley in her novels or short stories.
Unlike many fiction writers, she draws little from her life
experiences, family lore or innermost feelings. There are no clues
to her psyche in ``A Thousand Acres,'' her Pulitzer Prize-winning
tragedy about an Iowa farm family, or in ``Moo,'' a wicked satire
set on a Midwestern college campus, or in her latest book, ``The
All-True Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton,'' a romance
adventure set in 19th-century Kansas that's just out in paperback,
or even in ``Horse Heaven,'' the novel she's working on now about
the wild world of Thoroughbred horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pure Midwestern sensibility that prompts Smiley to avoid
looking inward for inspiration. Mining the outer world, after all,
provides endless possibilities, long after the personal well runs
dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing fiction is a mentally complex thing, which means
anybody can do it,'' Smiley says. ``It's the things that are not
complex _ shooting a ball through a hoop, running . . . _ that you
either have a talent for or you don't. . . . But any mental
activity _ even math _ people can learn. Writing is a skill, not a
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiley spent a recent balmy winter day at Wesleyan College, a
liberal arts college for women in Macon, delivering the 1999
Katharine Payne Carnes Lecture, and then working her way through a
series of smaller, more intimate exchanges with students and
enthralled community members.
</P>
<P>
   She is a comfortable, if not flashy, speaker _ more interested
in making a point than in impressing anyone or making friends. And
when she talks about her craft, writing fiction becomes a cosmic
event, an inexplicable collaboration between writer and story,
between words and a willing vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word knows where it wants to go,'' Smiley tells slightly
mystified students, some of whom aspire to be writers and some of
whom dream of nothing more this particular day than earning extra
credit in English. ``The way you learn to write is you learn not to
not write. It's a matter of getting out of the way. I have to learn
anew every day to sit and quit wasting time and to be there for the
story to come, the characters to come.''
</P>
<P>
   In Smiley's parlance, characters walk on and off the page at
will, speaking in dialogue that surprises even her. (In ``Moo,''
for instance, she swears she didn't know Chairman X's first name
until his wife used it on the very last page.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You keep yourself open for anything to come,'' Smiley says.
``Whatever comes, use it. Dickens, Trollope, George Eliot . . .
their greatest talent was that they could be there when the story
came to them,'' she adds. ``They gloried in it but also disappeared
in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing 6-foot-2 in flat shoes, Smiley is imposing in her
invisibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jane always had a tremendous kind of confidence, even when we
were all beginners and struggling,'' recalls North Carolina
novelist Allan Gurganus (``Plays Well With Others,'' ``Oldest
Living Confederate Widow Tells All''), a classmate of Smiley's at
the prestigious Iowa Writers' Workshop in 1974-76. ``She papered
one whole room of her house with rejection slips. But none of us
ever doubted that she was going to be a major voice. She's
immensely intelligent, very talented and serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she's complicated, to say the least,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   While at the workshop, Smiley lived in a ``very lively, crazy,
wonderful old Victorian farmhouse, full of books and
conversations,'' Gurganus recalls. ``And she grew corn right
outside the kitchen. . . . I tend to look back very tenderly on
those times.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other members of the class _ T. Coraghessen Boyle, Ron
Hansen and Richard Wiley _ have remained close friends over the
ensuing decades. When asked about Smiley's ongoing role in the
group, Gurganus demurs, lamenting the ``competitive nature'' of
some writers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Smiley doesn't mince words when talking about the
priority of writing in her life. ``My writing just goes on,'' she
recently told an interviewer for The Atlantic. ``It wasn't affected
by children, it wasn't affected by marriage, it wasn't affected by
teaching, it wasn't affected by quitting teaching. It's never been
affected by anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Answering questions thoughtfully and concisely, wasting few
words, gestures or even pleasantries, Smiley is a professor by
nature if no longer by vocation. In 1996 Smiley left Iowa State
University, where she taught for 15 years, and moved to a 3-acre
spread dubbed ``the Do-Re-Mi ranchette'' in northern California.
She relocated to indulge her latest, lingering interest _ and the
subject of her novel in progress _ raising thoroughbred horses. She
now owns 12, with three more on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horses were a passion when I was a child,'' Smiley says with a
slow smile. ``I gave it up when I went to college, and then resumed
it about 5 1/2 years ago, since my parents can no longer rein in my
passions.''
</P>
<P>
   Since settling in California, Smiley says she doesn't miss the
academic life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I still teach,'' she says. ``I just teach horses
instead of people. I put up my hand and say, `Ho!' That's still
teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago Smiley set a goal befitting her relentless genius _
to write each one of the four major narrative forms: epic (``The
Greenlanders''), tragedy (``A Thousand Acres''), comedy (``Moo'')
and romance (``Lidie Newton''). With that heady project completed,
Smiley was anxious to begin working on ``Horse Heaven.'' In true
Smiley style, she's trying something a little offbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the characters are horses,'' she says. ``Each one kind
of passes through the network of thoroughbred racing, so they all
have human associates. But some of the characters are horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiley has to be ``fairly obsessed'' with a subject before she
undertakes writing about it, and what she reads depends on what
she's writing at the time. For her current project, she's reading
publications such as the Thoroughbred Times, learning all she can
about horse breeding and genetics. To ensure her accuracy, she
solicits regular input from a horse breeder and a veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of learning is very deep in her,'' says Neil
Nakadate, a neighbor and a fellow professor at Iowa State for 15
years. His book ``Understanding Jane Smiley'' will be published in
May by the University of South Carolina Press. ``She likes to do
research, reading in and around a subject. . . . That very serious
research component is so important to her work as a creative
writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's constantly looking for a new challenge, some new project
that makes her have to do something differently,'' Nakadate says.
``And she's willing to take risks. If people don't like it, well,
it was still worth trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiley's claim to literary fame is a ceaseless attention to
detail _ whether in the farming methods of the 1970s or the social
structure of 14th-century Greenland _ and an astonishing range of
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accuracy is very important to me,'' she says. ``I try never to
take poetic license, because real events are always so much more
interesting than anything you could make up. Of course, there are
always places where nobody knows what really happened. Then I
extrapolate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lidie Newton'' is a case study of how a writer's obsession
takes hold. Smiley was on a book tour in Washington, D.C., in 1995
when she heard about the bombing of the federal building in
Oklahoma City. She telephoned a friend and told him she wanted to
write about ``the intersection of ideology and violence in American
life.'' Without hesitation he suggested that she consider Kansas in
1850.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a researcher's dream,'' Smiley says. ``It was an
election year, so there was a media storm, which meant there are
articles and memoirs and polemics _ an incredible amount of primary
source material. It was also a novelist's dream because it was not
a well-worn path.''
</P>
<P>
   Once she delved into the history of that turning point in
American history _ the tumultuous battleground between slavery and
abolition _ she was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Critical reaction to the book, published in hardback last
spring, was mostly positive, but sales were disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a controversial take on a controversial issue,'' she
says with a shrug. ``So everybody's going to have more of an
opinion on it than they're going to have on farming or Greenland .
. .''
</P>
<P>
   Smiley first learned the depth of modern-day opinions on slavery
in 1996, when she wrote an essay for Harper's magazine titled ``Say
It Ain't So, Huck,'' essentially debunking Mark Twain's most famous
work as the quintessential American novel. It's a firestorm she
still doesn't understand, even as she stands by her critique.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always kind of astonished me that anyone would care that I
don't really like Huck Finn, especially in the context of Twain's
sinking of the reputation of James Fenimore Cooper. Twain hated
Cooper, and he tried to make sure Cooper was never read again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twain would certainly honor my right to say whatever I thought
about any author, even if it was him, because he did that himself.
. . . One good thing that came out of that is that more people
said, `Maybe I should read ``Uncle Tom's Cabin.'' ' It's a
wonderful book and deserves to come back into the mainstream of
American fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiley's not shy about challenging any writer's work, including
her own. Last year, she wrote an essay for The Washington Post's
Book World repudiating her most successful work, ``A Thousand
Acres.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a writer, you are constantly confronted by what you put on
paper 20 years ago, in all its naivete and rigidness,'' she says.
``You may no longer believe any of that stuff. Some of it may
actually offend you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas Hardy and William Butler Yeats spent their later years
rewriting their earlier work. Every writer wants to bring their
work up to date. Do you want a record of your progressive
ignorance? Or do you want everything to look good in the end?''
</P>
<P>
   For ``an ever-renewing source of inspiration'' in her writing
life, Smiley relies heavily on her favorite author, Charles
Dickens: ``His style is wonderful and he's always just beyond
comprehension.'' Early next year, Viking is publishing a short
biography of Dickens penned by Smiley.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Smiley plans to keep doing what comes
naturally, writing two or three hours every morning, tending to
horses every afternoon and occasionally lecturing and teaching
humans. When asked by a Wesleyan student whether she would like to
see any more films made of her work, as in 1997's ``A Thousand
Acres,'' Smiley takes a long pause before answering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' she says finally. ``Hollywood is a large
shallow pond where nothing really interesting is going on. . . .
They always tempt you to have hopes and then they dash your hopes.
What they came up with for ``A Thousand Acres'' was earnest but not
very inspiring. So who cares?''
</P>
<P>
   Again, the Midwestern sensibility is clear: An author's success
isn't measured in movies, or even in dollar figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you keep at it and develop your standards of writing, you
will be published,'' Smiley says. ``But the word `successful' is so
subjective. I once heard Amy Tan describe me as being more
successful than her, and I almost fell out of my chair, because she
had much more money than me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to: Do you like sitting down and doing your work
every day? If you do, you're a success. If you don't, you're not.
It doesn't really matter how anybody else defines it.''

 &HT;    Gloriously gloomy: `Archangel' is true to spy-novel heritage
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 28.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Archangel. By Robert Harris. Random House. $24.95. 416 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The espionage novel wouldn't be what it is without a certain
gloom. The detective story develops toward a point of sudden
menace, but the low-level tension of the spy novel is altogether
different. Pervasive and vaguely ominous, it is the air that colors
character and detail. Where the murder mystery can be written in
the pastels of Southern California or South Florida _ not that most
are, but Raymond Chandler and John D. MacDonald wrought darkness
from the sunshine _ the thriller thrives in gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pious Friday evening in May and a fine river mist lying in
the market square.'' So begins John le Carre's ``A Small Town in
Germany.'' It is 10 minutes before midnight and the leather coats
of policemen ``glistened in the lamplight,'' and soon a single
church bell began ``its monotonous chime, a dirge for Christian
virtue in an empty city.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Harris, English like le Carre, has learned the technique
as well as anyone in contemporary fiction. ``Thick cloud had
pressed down on Berlin all night,'' his haunting first novel,
``Fatherland,'' began, and on the western horizon ``plumes of rain
drifted across the surface of Lake Havel like smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War of le Carre's fiction evoked damp nights and heavy
cloud cover even if day-to-day reality was otherwise. But Nazi
Germany, the setting of ``Fatherland,'' could only be imagined in
the grainy shades of old film footage. It was more than
atmospherics. Of all forms of fiction, the spy novel draws most on
sensory response. In ``Archangel,'' Harris immerses us in the
torpor and heaviness of Moscow and the forested expanses of
Siberia. Not only that, but he reacquaints us with Joseph Stalin
and Lavrenty Beria, head of the secret police under Uncle Joe.
</P>
<P>
   They are only background characters, but their presence anchors
everything. If the characters in the foreground are somewhat less
compelling, it only suggests the difficulty of forcing the template
of the thriller onto the less pliable past. Fluke Kelso, once a
promising historian at Oxford University, is in Moscow to attend a
symposium on newly opened Soviet archives. He is in his hotel room
one night when a man named Papu Rapava knocks on the door.
</P>
<P>
   Rapava, it seems, had been Beria's bodyguard and had spent time
in Siberia. After Stalin died of a stroke in 1953, the Kremlin went
into one of its periodic purges. Beria was executed and Rapava was
sentenced to 15 years' hard labor. He is old now, gruff and soaked
in vodka, but he carries with him a secret. It happens that on the
night Stalin suffered his stroke, Rapava was at the dictator's
dacha with Beria.
</P>
<P>
   As rigor mortis set in, Beria hurriedly took into his possession
some private papers no one knew existed. But Beria himself would
soon be dead, a victim of the same ruthlessness he had helped
Stalin carry out, and now they were in the hands of this boorish
old man who addresses the middle-aged Kelso as ``boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why Rapava should have chosen to intimate his secret to
Kelso, an academic has-been, is less than clear. But what ensues is
a chase through the forests to the Arctic port city of Archangel.
Along the way, a couple of other characters come onto the scene _
Vladimir Mamantov, a political extremist who would strike Americans
as a madman, and R.J. O'Brian, an unscrupulous Western journalist.
</P>
<P>
   For Kelso and O'Brian, the truth of what Stalin left behind
means different things _ for the one a last chance at scholarly
recognition, for the other a journalistic coup. It would be giving
too much away to suggest the nature of that truth, but as Kelso and
O'Brian are drawn to a remote frozen city on the White Sea,
Stalin's malevolence almost rises from the grave like a putrid gas.
</P>
<P>
   From book to book, the stock devices of the spy novel _ the
stranger with a secret, the Westerner in unfamiliar surroundings,
the dance of hunter and hunted, the obsession that drives the story
_ are like interchangeable parts. What distinguishes one novel from
another is the darkness of the obsession and the dread that attends
it. Stripped to its component parts, ``Archangel'' is well-paced,
garden-variety espionage, but Harris is a master of storytelling
with the patina of reportage:
</P>
<P>
   ``It never seemed to get properly light, even two hours after
dawn. It was as if the day had given up on itself before it even
started. The sky stayed gray, and the long concrete ribbon of road
that ran straight ahead of them dwindled into a damp murk. On
either side of the highway lay a wrinkled dead land of rust-colored
swamps and sickly yellowish plains _ the sub-Arctic tundra _ that
turned in the middle distance to dense, dark green forests of pine
and fir.''
</P>
<P>
   And at the end of that road, at the end of this skillfully
written novel, lies the stale breath of an awful past. Oxidized
anew, it has the frightful stench _ and the plausibility _ of
something buried but not fully decomposed.

   IMMIGRATION _ WASHINGTON _ Two weeks after Rep. Lamar Smith,
R-Texas, threatened to seek the resignation of Immigration and
Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner, the chairman of
the House immigration and claims subcommittee pledged Thursday to
seek more money for her budget. (Mollison, Cox News Service). 20

Clinton legal defense fund range from the famous to the obscure.
They include former U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright, who gave $100,

one Grand Prairie man who gave $1.69. We talk to some folks about

   GAS-PRICES _ Gas prices fell to their lowest point in history
this month, according to industry analyst Trilby Lundberg, who
produces the respected Lundberg Survey. The report, which checks
10,000 gas stations nationwide, found the average price of gas was
99.8 cents a gallon in mid-February. The cost of a gallon of gas in
1949 _ about 27 cents _ equals $1.86 in 1999 dollars when adjusted
for inflation, according to the U.S. Energy Information
Administration. The government began recording average gas consumer
prices in 1949. But drivers should enjoy the cheap fuel while it
lasts. Some fear that after a year of plunging, gas prices have
reached the floor. (Banstetter, Palm Beach Post). 12. WITH GRAPHIC.

   EPIDEMIC-EXHIBIT (New York) _ There's something about deadly
epidemics that both terrifies and fascinates people. One of the
best attended exhibitions ever mounted by the New York's American
Museum of Natural History was a six-week show in 1908. After a long
absence, germs are back at the museum. This weekend a new
exhibition will open in which dozens of infectious-disease
organisms will strut their stuff as computer animations,
eye-catching models, microphotographs, dioramas, and even real (but
dead) disease microorganisms. It is called ``Epidemic! The World of
Infectious Disease,'' and in this viewer's estimation, it is the
most impressive and informative exhibition the museum has mounted
in years. By Malcolm W. Browne.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Dear Mr. President:
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy your visit.
</P>
<P>
   No offense, sir, but don't you have more important things to do
than glad-hand with a large crowd of friendlies, including some of
those who helped put you over the top in Arizona during the last
presidential election?
</P>
<P>
   Not that we blame you for wanting to get out of Washington. You
know better than most how downright unfriendly a place it can be.
Just remember, you don't have much more time there. (We're counting
the days.)
</P>
<P>
   We know it's important for you to meet with the people, to
assure them that you truly are capable of acting presidential,
despite those painfully true things the House managers said during
the impeachment hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But we would thrill more to the sight of you and Congress
actually working together, putting your partisan shoulders to the
wheel to do the people's business.
</P>
<P>
   At least while you're here, you'll talk up pressing national
matters: Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   There are few issues more important to more Americans _ young,
old, rich, poor and all along the political spectrum _ than
figuring out what to do about programs so tightly woven into the
American social fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, with its concentration of retirees and its steady
influx of upwardly mobile and anxious young workers, needs signs
that national leadership is capable of righting the listing ship
called Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   We'd love for you to choose Tucson as the place to be forthright
about the so-called budget surplus that you propose to use to save
Social Security. Tell us true. It's really not a surplus, is it?
Oh, by Beltway standards it is, but if the rest of us did the books
like you folks in Washington, we'd be in bankruptcy _ or jail.
</P>
<P>
   Where else can you pay operating expenses by borrowing from a
fund meant to pay retirees, count those dollars as revenue and then
tout budget surpluses?
</P>
<P>
   Using Social Security funds to report a balanced budget is a
little like a working couple figuring in their projected pension
benefits to balance the checkbook. It's a neat trick, but the banks
and creditors wouldn't be amused.
</P>
<P>
   We know fixing the system is going to require some bold strokes
of leadership. But are you really serious about investing the
nation's projected budget surplus _ your word, not ours _ in the
stock market?
</P>
<P>
   You actually want the government to invest Social Security funds
in the stock market and become a shareholder in major corporations?
What was that Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said about
your stock market plan? Oh, yes, it has ``very far-reaching
potential dangers for a free American economy and a free American
society.''
</P>
<P>
   We agree that some aspect of privatization of Social Security
will be necessary to give American workers a healthy retirement
income. But it makes more sense for these investments to occur
among individuals in private accounts, not with government holding
shares in private businesses.
</P>
<P>
   You've got an idea to pay down the national debt and earmark the
savings for Social Security. Go with that. That sells well in a
state whose people generally want as much financial freedom as
government will allow them. Give hope to those many Arizonans who
view debt as a plague on society and taxes a bitter medicine for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy Arizona. We do.
</P>
<P>
   But please do hurry back to Washington. You've work to do. &QL;

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia The matronly woman turns on her sympathetic
smile, gently gaveling to order a meeting. It will generate as much
electric snap as a weekly flower club luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   But with Indonesia facing its first free election since 1955, a
score of news cameras and tape recorders suck in every word and
gesture. For the woman in black soon may be the most powerful woman
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Candidate Megawati Sukarnoputri, 52, is the daughter of the
father of Indonesia, the late President Sukarno. She wants to make
the presidency a family tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Megawati is regarded as the most popular, charismatic figure,
with a huge following,'' acknowledged Dewi Fortuna Anwar, spokesman
for Indonesia's interim president, B.J. Habibie, who is striving to
be reelected on his own after 125 million Indonesians go to the
polls this June.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, even many Indonesians who like Megawati are at
a loss to explain just what this enigmatic woman stands for. Nor
can they say how she plans to repair the world's fourth most
populous nation, with 17,508 islands sunk in economic decline and
peppered with social mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is she? What is her program? Who are the people behind
her?'' asked Oriana Pudjastutie, a wealthy, educated businesswoman
who lives a few miles from Megawati's villa in Jakarta's lush
southern suburbs. ``We all liked her in the past when she was in
opposition to Suharto.''
</P>
<P>
   She referred to former President Suharto, who was pushed out of
office last May after 32 years in power. His departure elevated
then-vice president Habibie to power and cleared the way for
parliamentary elections in June. The new parliament will be central
in selecting the next president this fall.
</P>
<P>
   One mark in Megawati's favor: since joining the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI) in 1987, she has been a foe of Suharto. It
was Gen. Suharto who became head of state in 1967 after a coup
evicted Sukarno, and it was Suharto's forces that stage-managed
Megawati's expulsion from the PDI in 1996 when her growing
popularity became a threat.
</P>
<P>
   The ouster sparked riots. Rather than take to the streets
herself, Megawati quietly re-formed a party lately named
PDI-Struggle. Now she is its presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Her second asset is her father. Sukarno (who like many
Indonesians used only a single name) pioneered the movement to
throw off Dutch colonial rule at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He gathered this archipelago of disparate cultures and
traditions into one country, something even the Dutch had not
attempted to do when they administered the islands as a group of
``sub-colonies'' rather than a single, homogeneous unit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his increasingly autocratic rule, Sukarno the liberator
decades later still wears a hero's mantle to many Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati, a mother of three whose husband Taufik Kiemas is a
businessman, capitalizes on her father's heritage. The meeting she
chaired last Tuesday introduced a new party advisory board, for
example, and at least three of seven members had direct ties to
Sukarno's regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a new trend. People want to have a woman as their
leader. But besides that, Megawati also is attractive because she
is the daughter of Sukarno,'' said Abdul Madjid, 81, a cabinet
secretary under Sukarno who swore to faithfully advise
PDI-Struggle. ``She always stands for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Megawati may stand for the people, but she also keeps her
distance from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is surrounded by thick walls. I think Megawati is a puppet
leader, directed by her advisers,'' said political rival Amien
Rais, leader of a Muslim-based reform party. He complained that
Megawati won't even give him her home or cell phone number so they
could consult about common strategies.
</P>
<P>
   After the Tuesday meeting Indonesian journalists ganged up on
economist Kwik Kian Gie, a key Megawati aide, demanding to know why
she refuses to debate, grant interviews, or answer questions about
news developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is in print, so I don't think she has to talk about
it again and again,'' responded Kwik. ``She is (for) less talk,
more action.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics speculate that Megawati, who attended two Indonesian
universities but did not graduate, cannot handle the verbal thrust
and parry of politics.
</P>
<P>
   She would have to answer for some non-reformist positions, like
her resistance to ending the political role of the military, which
still fills 38 seats in parliament, or her flat opposition to
independence for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, she stood silent during months of
confrontation when Indonesian students risked their lives in
violent demonstrations that finally forced the ouster of Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many average people like her image. But we couldn't count on
her to make a better system than we have now,'' worried Mustafa
Fakhri, a law student and a leader of the demonstrations.

NEW PALM PILOT IS A STEP ABOVE ITS PREDECESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You can't be too skinny, too bright or too
connected. Especially when it comes to a hand-held organizer.
</P>
<P>
   The 3Com Corp. has embraced this high-society truism with the
latest in its popular line of personal information managers, the
Palm V, which appeared on store shelves Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The original Palm Pilot, which debuted in early 1996, was an
instant hit in a languishing market filled with some clunky,
calculator-like devices that made a simple paper planner seem high
tech.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 3Com's organizers hold a 70 percent share of the
hand-held computer market, according to IDC, a marketing firm based
in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The field is becoming more crowded. Using the Microsoft CE
operating system based on the Windows operating system, most of the
major computer manufacturers, including Hewlett-Packard and the
Compaq Computer Corp., are producing hand-held devices.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, IDC estimated that 2.5 million hand-held computers had
been sold in the United States. That market is expected to increase
to 3.4 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palm has got the incumbency,'' said Chris Stix, an analyst at
SG Cowen &AMP; Co. in Boston. ``They just dominate now.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Diana Hwang, a research manager specializing in hand-held
computing devices at IDC: ``3Com simply has the larger installed
base, and we expect the Palm V to solidify that.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Palm Pilot was capable of holding 500 names and a
year's worth of to-do items. It featured a small screen for
scribbling data using a handwriting software package called
Graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   But it was dull gray and had some sharp edges. It also didn't
have an integrated cover, and the delicate screen could easily be
scratched.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm III solved those problems. It eliminated some of the
sharper corners and came with an attached flip-up cover. But there
was still that dull, gray plastic, which was starting to look
decidedly down market in a field of blossoming competitors like the
Philips Nino, which sported a polished aluminum skin.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm V is a vast design improvement over its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   The new Palm sports a slim anodized metal casing that's half the
thickness of the Palm III. The murky monochrome screen, which had
always been a weakness in previous Palms, has been replaced by a
crisper, sharper liquid-crystal display. The screen is just a tad
smaller than the Palm III, but the sharper image makes up for size.
</P>
<P>
   Some other good changes in the Palm V:
</P>
<P>
   _ The contrast button, which was a hard-to-use wheel on the
older Palms, is now an on-screen feature activated by a recessed
push switch.
</P>
<P>
   _ The desktop cradle now has a built-in charger that replenishes
the Palm V's built-in lithium batteries. No hunting around for
AAAs, and no more draining the batteries when the device is being
used while parked in the cradle.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Palm V contains 2 megabytes of memory, which means it can
store the names, addresses and phone numbers of 6,000 people, as
well as five years of appointments, 1,500 to-do items and 1,500
memos.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers at 3Com, based in Santa Clara, Calif., have come up
with an ingenious solution to the screen cover problem: There are
channels carved into both sides of the device, made to fit either
the included weighted stylus or the edge of a leather and rubber
cover pad. Users can decide whether they want the elegant cover pad
to open on the left or right. A small detail, but nice.
</P>
<P>
   An optional 33-bits-per-second modem is available in case users
want to access e-mail on the road. 3Com plans to release the Palm
VII this spring, which will feature a built-in wireless modem. The
price is expected to be about $700.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm V's synchronization software, which allows duplication
of data on a desktop computer, now includes a ``conduit'' that is
compatible with the ubiquitous Microsoft Outlook data manager.
</P>
<P>
   At $499, the Palm V isn't cheap. However, buyers can save
themselves $100 and get the $399 Palm IIIx, which has a slightly
larger, sharper screen than the Palm III, and sports 4 megabytes of
RAM.

REMOVE BAY LEAVES BEFORE SERVING DISHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LISA STEVENS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Why do recipes that call for bay leaves always say to remove
them before serving the food?
</P>
<P>
   A: The bay leaf's edges are very sharp and have been know to
perforate people's intestines, so be sure to remove the herb after
cooking, Tufts University recommends in its ``Tufts University
Guide to Total Nutrition.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I like to keep a variety of gourmet coffee beans on hand for
when friends drop by. What's the best way to store the coffee?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're smart to buy the whole bean coffee to preserve its
freshness. Ground coffee loses its flavor more rapidly than whole
bean because it presents more surface area and smaller particles to
the air that accelerate the loss of the coffee's characteristic
oils. Store the coffee in an airtight container. The best
containers are glass ones with a rubber ring sealing lid since
these will not alter the taste or characteristics of your coffee.
Don't store your coffee in the refrigerator because this introduces
extra moisture and unwanted flavors into the coffee. You can freeze
it to maintain the freshness.
</P>
<P>
   Whole beans freeze better than ground coffee. You'll want to
take the coffee out of the bag you bought it in and freeze it in an
airtight container. And remember, don't keep coffee frozen longer
than three months.

 &HT;    By Judith Green

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ James DePreist, music director of the Oregon Symphony
in Portland and the Monte Carlo Philharmonic, will conduct the
Atlanta Symphony Orchestra this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   DePreist, 62, last conducted the ASO 10 years ago. He is the
nephew of the great American contralto Marian Anderson. He will
lead the ASO in a program that features the Symphony in F sharp by
Erich Korngold (1897-1957), one of Europe's most impressive talents
until he was forced into exile from Austria by the Nazis in the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   He resettled in Hollywood, where his film scores included the
Errol Flynn pirate epic ``Captain Blood'' and the Oscar-winning
``Anthony Adverse'' and ``The Adventures of Robin Hood.'' Of
Korngold, DePreist says: ``There's movie music, and there's movie
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Guest artist Leila Josefowicz, 21, will play the violin concerto
of Felix Mendelssohn.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Era Dance,'' which opens the program, is by Aaron Jay
Kernis, 39, who won a Pulitzer Prize in music last year.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Symphony Orchestra with James DePreist, conductor; Leila
Josefowicz, violin. 8 tonight-Saturday; 2 p.m. Saturday (casual
concert). $19-$48. Symphony Hall, Woodruff Arts Center, 1280
Peachtree St. N.E. , Atlanta 404-733-5000.

 &HT;    Skiing is just the beginning of the snow-season pleasures that
await in crystal-blue Banff
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 28.
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANFF, Alberta _ You should be as lucky as me right now: I am
stamping my Australian wool-lined sheepskin boots on a glittering
frozen pond in the middle of western Canada.
</P>
<P>
   It is New Year's Eve, not many minutes before midnight. But it
could be almost any winter night of the year here. My right hand is
wrapped around a steaming, very strong Irish coffee; my left is
deep inside the pocket of my ski parka. It's cold: minus-something
Celsius, which translates into plus-something Fahrenheit, though
not plus-something much. But I'm dressed for it, and the sky is the
clearest, darkest black you've ever seen, and the Big Dipper is
turned upside down and spilling stars all over the place while the
man in the full Canadian moon is grinning a big, goofy, McKenzie
brothers smile.
</P>
<P>
   That bright grin lights up everything: three soaring peaks of
Canadian Rockies that run along the frozen river behind me; the
castlelike Banff Springs Hotel (circa 1888) that rises on the steep
hill to my right; the snow-bloated pines that scent the air
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   My teenage son is somewhere on top of that hill in front of me,
with a herd of other kids, streaming on a toboggan down the packed,
moonlit snow. Every other trip he hits a bump and sails through the
frosty air for long, suspended moments, as if frozen there,
stop-frame, cartoonlike, before finally landing with a thud.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Ann, is here, too: She's the one taking her sweet time
skating at the other end of the pond, mixing with a couple dozen
locals. Some of them are playing hockey; one is slashing back and
forth with a shovel in his hands, clearing snow so there's even
more room to skate; another is pulling his swaddled, gurgling baby
behind him in a sled, with a string of kids on skates holding on
from behind and laughing as they're slung along.
</P>
<P>
   Some couples are skating around the pond in slow, lazy circles,
hand in hand. I did that with my wife earlier, before I chucked my
skates, my legs mushy from the day's dawn-to-dusk skiing between
the towering glaciers over at Lake Louise _ which, by the way, is
unreal, and which I'll get to in a minute.
</P>
<P>
   But first you need to see this stuff. What's happening here
tonight could be almost any winter night in this part of the world:
The skiing here is great, but the being here is something else.
</P>
<P>
   There's a fire blazing on the other side of that thigh-high
snowdrift. I'm headed there in a minute, to huddle next to families
huddled on benches around it, talking about mutual friends and
their kids' teachers and how the elk are always mating on the golf
course during warm weather while you're trying to hit a 5-iron
(``There was this male just surrounded by females. He should be on
`Jerry Springer' ''). I'm headed there right after I trudge up the
hill for one more Irish coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's really almost midnight: I'm next to the fire and a guy
on a cell phone has signaled everybody to start counting down the
New Year _ ten! nine! eight! _ the shouted numbers hanging white in
the air like living ice sculptures, clanging into each other as
more are let loose _ five! four! _ a dozen kids and adults
sprinting back up the hill with their toboggans and sleds and
saucers and plastic sheets _ anything! _ to slide down in one last
ring-in-the-New-Year scramble.
</P>
<P>
   And then the countdown ends and champagne bottles are uncorked
and skaters hug each other and there's a crazy pile of people at
the bottom of the toboggan run and I kiss my wife's frozen lips and
my son's frozen head and throw back the last of my Irish coffee.
</P>
<P>
   And I ask myself: Who does winter better than Canada?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody.
</P>
<P>
   Quirky, cosmopolitan
</P>
<P>
   You come here in the winter to ski. There are three resorts
within Banff National Park, two of them _ Lake Louise and Sunshine
Village _ considered among the best in North America.
</P>
<P>
   But Banff is more than a skier's paradise during the snow
season, which bleeds into early May. That New Year's Eve moment is
the kind of thing that runs through this place like a dry-ice
charge. A quaintly overgrown mountain town (population: 7,500),
Banff is where The United Colors of Benetton meets ``Northern
Exposure.'' Hip and quirky, it's an international magnet that draws
Americans and Japanese and Brits and Germans with its memorable
skiing, wry Canadian cheerfulness and generous exchange rate (it
currently adds about 50 cents to every U.S. dollar).
</P>
<P>
   The pretty little downtown, with a main street bookended by
mountains, is crammed with more than 80 restaurants of all stripes
(Canadian, Korean, Japanese, Greek, Mexican). Souvenir shops range
from Canadian Mountie tacky to indigenous peoples artful. There are
ski shops, bars, a bowling alley, a movie theater _ and, yes, a
United Colors of Benetton and a Hard Rock Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet whatever ski-culture flash Banff possesses (and it ain't
much) is tempered mightily by the playful earthiness you'd expect
in a huge, hugely popular national park, located about an hour and
a half west of Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   This is a place where elk are spotted sidling down the middle of
Banff Avenue (``Zey look friendly like aye pet, but eet eez just a
front,'' a French-Canadian bus driver warned us of the area's
ubiquitous elk, who are not to be messed with).
</P>
<P>
   A handmade sign warns inside a Banff hospital emergency room:
ABSOLUTELY NO SKI BOOTS BEYOND THIS POINT! As if. (One doctor said
the hospital averages 40 skiers a day, while a nurse said she
relishes the hour respite between when the last skiers leave and
the first drunks arrive.)
</P>
<P>
   The park radio station provides a daily avalanche bulletin and
airs stories of National Public Radio quality on topics that range
from ``Tales of the Canadian Rockies'' to wildlife inbreeding to
Hudson Bay rum.

   BANFF, Alberta: Hudson Bay Rum.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the skiing. Oh, man. I'm a piker on skis, and
my son was a first-timer, and my wife is a somewhat reluctant
veteran of slopes around the world (she has teared up at the summit
of lifts from Innsbruck to Squaw Valley). So as a family, we run
what you'd call the gamut.
</P>
<P>
   And we all had a ball.
</P>
<P>
   There's a startling, almost vertiginous feeling here of skiing
on top of the world (``Do you think that's the top?'' my wife asked
as we drove through the canyon winding to Sunshine Village,
pointing to a towering peak that disappeared into a cloud). The
snow here is plentiful and powdery, and the views never end,
especially those at Lake Louise, about 35 miles from Banff.
</P>
<P>
   A beginner's green trail runs from every lift there. That allows
absolutely anybody a look at the heart-stopping scenery that
includes above-cloud vistas of a frozen Lake Louise and a bulging
Victoria Glacier and a string of ice-capped Rockies that run and
run until they disappear into a mist you suspect stops somewhere
just short of the North Pole. (From certain angles you look toward
the nearby Icefields Parkway, a northbound, glacier-lined route
considered one of the world's most scenic.)
</P>
<P>
   Standing on skis at the summit of the aptly named ``Top of the
World'' chairlift, for instance, you get a sense that the hand of
God could reach right down at any moment and, with a forefinger or
a pinky, just flick you a million miles away. When he doesn't, you
ski on down. Trails run all over and behind the mountains, with
lodges tucked away so that many runs become their own destination.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine Village, about 15 miles west of Banff, is most famous
for its snow _ averaging more than 30 feet a season, it doesn't use
snow-making machines. A dizzying, mountain-scaling, 25-minute
gondola ride is required to get to the main ski area (expert skiers
often unload a little earlier, at Goat's Eye Mountain, which offers
some of Sunshine's most challenging runs). It's best to get to the
gondola before 9 a.m. to avoid long lines.
</P>
<P>
   Once at the resort, you're in the middle of it all; skiing is
almost 360 degrees around you. There's a rustic lodge and
restaurant, along with a newer set of shops _ but no cars within
sight. Families with young children like to stay at the few
accommodations available here _ the ski-in, ski-out Sunshine
Village Inn and some condos _ for that reason. Chairs take you from
sweeping beginner runs to a trail that literally spans the
Continental Divide, allowing you to cross from Alberta into British
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The only way out of Sunshine Village is the gondola _ or the
miles-long, beginners-can-do-it, ski-out run that weaves below the
gondola much of the way. It was one of the highlights of our trip.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't make it to Mount Norquay, 10 minutes from Banff. Its
reputation is of a lower-altitude, family-friendly resort. It's a
great place to go if you only want to ski half a day, then do
something else. Like head back into Banff for shopping. Or take a
dip in the areas's year-round hot springs. Or drive the scenic,
30-minute route along the Bow Valley Parkway to Johnston Canyon,
where snow-packed hiking trails snake past two frozen waterfalls
(ice climbers often scale the largest of them).
</P>
<P>
   Or . . . you can wait for night, to skate or toboggan or just
bask in the glow of that bright, grinning Canadian moon.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Reserve by Monday to take advantage of a sale
to Calgary _ $375 round trip for midweek travel through June 14
(with 14-day advance purchase) _ on Delta, United, American,
Northwest, Continental and Air Canada. After Monday, the fare jumps
to $555.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Accommodations: Some suggested midprice hotels: Inns of Banff,
a pleasantly convenient, few-frills spot (1-800-661-1272); and the
slightly more atmospheric Banff Caribou Lodge (1-800-563-8764).
More luxurious digs: Banff Springs Hotel (1-800-441-1414); Chateau
Lake Louise (1-800-441-1414); Post Hotel, in Lake Louise, whose
Dining Room is one of the area's best restaurants (1-800-661-1586).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where to eat: Among midprice favorites: Earl's, 229 Banff
Ave., an easy (if often crowded) respite that has something
(Canadian, Mexican, Cajun, Asian) for just about everyone's taste;
the Grizzly House, 207 Banff Ave., a Canadian-appointed fondue
restaurant that has a vibrating lounge chair in the waiting lobby
to shake out the day's soreness before you eat; and Joe Btfsplk's,
a vowel-less, '50s-style diner that's great for a sit-down
cheeseburger and fries.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where to wash it down: The relatively new St. James Gate, 205
Wolf St., an Irish pub with a wide selection of beers on tap and 50
brands of single-malt scotch. Other standbys: the Rose &AMP; Crown, 202
Banff Ave.; Wild Bill's Legendary Saloon, 201 Banff Ave.; and the
Barbary Coast, upstairs at 119 Banff Ave.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  When you're not skiing: Pamper yourself at the luxurious Upper
Hot Springs Spa (403-760-2500) or the Solace spa at Banff Springs
Hotel (403-762-1772). Take a heart-arresting ride on a bobsled or
luge at Canada Olympic Park in Calgary, home of the '88 Winter
Olympics (403-247-5452). Take a snowy, heart-easing sleigh ride:
Holiday on Horseback in Banff (403-762-4551) and Brewster Lake
Louise Sleighrides (403-762-5454). Or take a dog sled ride. Many
outfits to choose from, including Mountain Mushers Dog Sled Tours
(403-762-3647). Take a nature tour in Banff at the Cave and Basin
National Historic Site (403-762-4335).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Booking a trip: Several travel agencies specialize in ski
vacations. One we found particularly helpful in booking our entire
Banff trip (plane, hotel, rental car and lift tickets): Aspen Ski
Tours, 1-800-525-2052.

 &HT;    New lodge 5-mile walk from Amicalola park
 &HT;    By Clint Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   About two miles into the five-mile hike the chill drizzle became
a downpour, the sort that rips leaves off the trees. My son Taylor
walked ahead of me, wearing an oversized yellow rain slicker over
his day pack. In what could only be the result of free association
by a 7-year-old, he began singing above the roar of the rain:
``Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly . . .'' The entire
score of ``The Wizard of Oz'' followed.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, did I want to go back to the car.
</P>
<P>
   But I slogged on, led through the woods by the improbable
offspring of Judy Garland and Quasimodo. What kept me going was the
knowledge that at the end of the trek I would be dry and warm and
well-fed. Instead of pitching a tent on soggy ground in a driving
rain, I would be taking a hot shower.
</P>
<P>
   Crummy weather sharpens your appreciation for the special
qualities of the Len Foote Hike Inn at Amicalola Falls State Park.
The rustic 20-room lodge, named for the naturalist who was the
inspiration for the comic strip series Mark Trail, was designed to
provide an experience somewhere between a tent and a Holiday Inn.
Although it has been open for less than four months, it has become
quite popular: Every Saturday night through April is booked.
</P>
<P>
   The lodge, which spreads over 5,750 square feet, was designed
and built to have minimal impact on the wooded, mountaintop site.
The four buildings that make up the lodge were built on stilts to
minimize grading. Composting toilets are used because building a
septic tank leech field would have meant cutting down more trees,
said Garland Reynolds, the Gainesville architect who designed the
lodge.
</P>
<P>
   The look of the lodge was inspired by traditional Japanese inns.
The broad eaves of the steeply pitched roofs provide continuous
cover as you move from the bunkhouse to the bathhouse to the mess
hall and on to the Sunrise Room, where built-in seating surrounds a
wood stove. The Sunrise Room serves as the primary social and
entertainment center of the lodge. It is well-stocked with books
and board games; Taylor was kept amused through a rainy afternoon
and evening.
</P>
<P>
   There are other gathering spots at the inn. The lobby of the
bunkhouse where guests check in after making it up the trail is
furnished with mission style furniture that looks like it could
have been ordered from L.L. Bean. Guests gather around the wood
stove here too, chatting while their boots and socks dry by the
stove.
</P>
<P>
   Other guests can be found in the mess hall, playing backgammon
and sipping coffee, hot cocoa or fruit punch that is available
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond fellowship, it is the wood stoves that bring people to
these places.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms aren't heated.
</P>
<P>
   They are truly spartan, little more than an 8-by-10-foot wood
box. There is a ceiling light and an electric fan for warm summer
nights, but no electrical outlets. The bunk beds are comfortable,
but there is no other furniture. As you lay in bed at night you can
hear the rain on the roof and the snoring of the guy next door.
</P>
<P>
   The bathhouse offers two showers for each sex. The sink counter
has electrical outlets, which made Jill Smith's decision to pack a
blow dryer a wise one. The Marietta (Ga.) woman took some ribbing
for hauling a hair dryer to the woods, but many other women took
advantage of it after spending most of the day walking in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   After a hot shower, it is soon time for supper, served after a
ringing of the dinner bell at 6:30. Meals are served family-style,
with heaping platters of meat and vegetables set on the table.
Guests mix at tables of four or six, passing dishes and swapping
stories. The menu on our visit included grilled chicken, pot roast,
salad, succotash and killer biscuits about the size of a 45 rpm
record.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast is served at 8 a.m. Coffee, cocoa and other hot drinks
are available for early risers who wander into the Sunrise Room to
watch the sun come up. Again, the meal is tasty and hearty: eggs,
bacon, sausage and apple corn bread.
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast, some visitors take off on day hikes. Springer
Mountain, starting point of the Appalachain Trail, is about three
miles away. Most guests, however, find the hike to the lodge and
back exercise enough and spend the morning relaxing in one of the
many Adirondack chairs scattered about the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a challenging, but not brutal, hike with hot meals
and a hot shower at the end of the trail appeals to tenderfoots and
hard-core hikers alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it would be a safe adventure,'' said Jill Smith,
the hiker with the hair dryer.
</P>
<P>
   The hike to the inn was the first lengthy walk in the woods with
her husband, Brian, who admitted, ``I came under duress.''
</P>
<P>
   But the experience was worth it, Smith said, adding that he
particularly liked hearing the stories of people like Bob and
Barbara Stephens. The mostly retired couple from Evans, near
Augusta (Ga.), has covered a lot of ground in the past 15 years,
including treks through the Grand Canyon. The inn, they said,
provided all the necessary comforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take the pit toilets,'' Barbara said, ``if you can
have hot showers.''
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast, the boy and I explore the grounds of the inn,
including Starbase, a sort of solar calendar that architect
Reynolds designed and built just for fun with the help of John
Burgess, an astronomer at the Fernbank Science Center.
</P>
<P>
   It's sunny and warm as we begin our hike back to the car. We
take an alternate return route that follows the approach trail to
the Appalachian Trail.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, we find some bear scat in the trail and study it
a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, today we saw something amazing,'' Taylor says.
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the trail, Taylor asks if we can come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``And can we bring Mom when we come back?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Mom can come.
</P>
<P>
   After all, there is an outlet for her hair dryer in the
bathhouse.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Amicalola Falls State Park is 15 miles
northwest of Dawsonville (Ga.). Take Ga. 53 west out of
Dawsonville, then Ga. 183 north to Ga. 52 east. Check in at the
visitors center at the entrance of the park to pay a $2 parking fee
and to get directions to the parking lot for the Hike Inn
trailhead.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The hike: Be sure to check out the view from the top of
Amicalola Falls, the highest waterfall in the state. There is a
short trail from the trailhead parking lot to the top of the falls.
The hike to the inn is just under five miles, with a total
elevation gain of about 500 feet. The longest uphill pull begins
after the second stream crossing. Plan on a two- to three-hour
hike, depending on your level of fitness.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rates: The rate is $55 per person double occupancy, $75 single
occupancy. Children are slightly less. A family of three can sleep
in one room, with the child getting a pad on the floor. The rate
includes dinner and breakfast. Trail lunches and snacks are
available for an extra charge.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What to bring: Despite the accommodations, you must be
prepared for a day in the woods. Bring toiletries, flashlight,
first aid kit, extra clothes, water, insect repellent. Wear
comfortable hiking boots or walking shoes and be prepared for a
change in the weather. In cold weather, bring a stocking cap. The
bunks have plenty of blankets, but whatever sticks out from beneath
the covers may get cold.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Reservations: In metro Atlanta, call 770-389-7275. Outside
metro Atlanta, call 1-800-864-7275.

<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah _ Staff photographer David Tulis, an avid skier,
is drawn to the collision of past and present in this mining
outpost-turned-hip hangout.
</P>
<P>
   Some ski towns are modern inventions, with a history shorter
than your average beginner's run. Not so Park City, where silver
mining dates to the 1860s and where vestiges of a frontier past
stand strong and proud amid a ski resort with up-to-the-minute
amenities.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the town's ultimate time warp: Catalog entrepreneur and
sometime movie star Robert Redford, artistic director of the
Sundance Film Festival, held here every January, owns a trendy
restaurant in what was once the Union Pacific train depot. It's the
same place that was regularly robbed by the real Sundance Kid.
</P>
<P>
   Why, they oughta make a movie. . . .

</P>
<P>
   The expansion, the fourth in the museum's 70-year history,
doubles the size of the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights include three new galleries, bringing the total to
13; a 400-seat auditorium; a fully equipped artists' studio; an
education center; a cafe; and an expanded museum shop and
bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   Grand opening festivities culminate next weekend with the 41st
annual Heard Museum Guild Indian Fair and Market. On March 20-21,
the museum will host the ninth annual World Championship Hoop Dance
Contest.

   &QR;  Sugar in the morning: The sap is rising in Massachusetts, and
visitors through early April can watch farmers performing the art
of maple sugaring.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts legend has it that after Iroquois Chief Woksis
threw his tomahawk into a maple tree one winter evening in 1609 and
returned to retrieve it the next day, sap began flowing from the
hole left by the tomahawk. The tribe used the sap to boil meat,
then discovered the taste was wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   Popular souvenirs among tourists are the pure maple products
created at sugarhouses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to traditional pancake syrup, the sap can yield
maple candy; ``soft sugar'' or ``maple cream,'' a soft table
spread; and ``sugar on snow,'' a taffy-like treat made by
thickening syrup on a stove and then immediately pouring it over a
pan of clean snow.
</P>
<P>
   For information on maple sugaring and sugarhouses, visit the
Massachusetts Maple Producers' Web site, which can be found at
(http://www.massmaple.org) or call the Massachusetts Maple Phone

 &HT;    Mirror, mirror, on the wall: Can I buy a younger face after all?
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday Feb. 28.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most women don't mind acting their age. They just
don't want their face to make a formal announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Although baby boomers are richer, fitter and more
technologically advanced than their parents were, they are no
closer to discovering the fountain of youth than the generation
before them. But that hasn't stopped them from looking for hope in
a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-aging skin care products are one of the fastest-growing
segments of the cosmetics industry. Consumers spent $3 billion on
facial treatments in 1998, according to Kline &AMP; Co., a cosmetics
research firm in Little Falls, N.J. In 1997, skin care accounted
for $1.5 billion in sales in better department stores.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the skin care business, including anti-aging products,
has grown 6 percent a year for the past five years, said Lenka
Contreras, project manager at Kline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot given that the industry as a whole is only growing
by 2 percent to 3 percent a year,'' she said. ``It's just the aging
population and new product formulations that offer different types
of benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Women are the main customers. As long as Hollywood and Madison
Avenue define beauty by how youthful a woman looks, products that
claim to remove wrinkles, firm sagging skin and eliminate dark
pigmentation spots are likely to be in demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, I do it all,'' said Debbie Webb as she shopped for
cosmetics recently at Nordstrom at Perimeter Mall. Webb, 47, of
Peachtree City estimates that she spends more than $1,500 a year on
products to make her skin look younger. And that doesn't include
the monthly pumpkin facials, a treatment rich in exfoliating fruit
acids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're not going to turn the clock back,'' Webb
admits, ``but they're going to make the changes less drastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Skin care experts say that over-the-counter anti-aging
treatments are more hype than hope. They make you feel as if you're
doing something good for your skin, but dermatologists say they
won't reverse wrinkles, eliminate lines or tighten skin.
</P>
<P>
   What the products can do, according to dermatologists, is
exfoliate surface layers of dead skin, leaving your facing looking
polished and smooth. Commercial treatments also can hydrate the
skin to help it look less sullen. Other products can lighten dark
spots that women get from the sun and when their hormones change
during menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Perception is everything; the results, only temporary. ``If you
think you'll put it on and your husband will say, `My God, you look
five years younger,' that's not going to happen,'' warned David
Steinberg, a cosmetics consultant and professor of cosmetic
chemistry at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Teaneck, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Dermatologists say the best way to protect skin and prevent
premature aging is to avoid going out into the sun without wearing
sunscreen. The practice should start in the cradle.
</P>
<P>
   When dark spots and age lines start to appear, experts say, the
most effective treatments contain alpha hydroxy acids, particularly
glycolic and lactic acids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's the kind of thing that's going to be the
eternal fountain of youth,'' said Dr. Daniel Zivony, a
dermatologist at Emory Clinic North (Emory University, Atlanta).
``But it's reasonable for women to expect fresher feeling skin.''
</P>
<P>
   But finding cosmetics that contain alpha hydroxy ingredients can
be tricky. Cosmetic manufacturers are required by law to limit the
concentration of glycolic acids in commercial skin care products.
Dosages high enough to minimize or camouflage signs of aging must
be prescribed by a dermatologist or other licensed practitioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to be effective, you need a glycolic acid of between
35 and 75 percent,'' Zivony said. ``They can't sell high
concentrations of glycolic acid like that over the counter.''
</P>
<P>
   Many brands don't indicate on the label what, if any, percent of
glycolic acid is inside. Sales clerks often don't know, either.
</P>
<P>
   Although some products made by companies such as Mary Kay, Avon
and L'Oreal list alpha hydroxy among their ingredients, many other
popular lines don't. For example, Estee Lauder's new Resilience
Lift, a face and throat cream with SPF 15, doesn't state that
glycolic acid is one of its active agents, nor do Clarins
extra-firming face creams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have alpha hydroxy acid products,'' said Clinique
spokesperson Shannon Cooney.
</P>
<P>
   Clinique this month came out with a product called Stop Signs,
an anti-aging serum that sells for $32.50 an ounce. It promises to
smooth, firm and tone. But even Cooney acknowledges, ``Clinique
doesn't really say we're going to turn back the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Dermatologists and other licensed practitioners dispense higher,
more effective levels of glycolic and lactic acids in chemical
peels and moisturizing creams sold by prescription. The products
work best when used with Retin-A, a vitamin A derivative frequently
prescribed for acne. They help exfoliate age spots, replenish the
skin and gently fill in the appearance of fine lines. But they
don't perform miracles.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean women should give up the good fight and simply
grow old gracefully. Experts advise that if a particular skin
treatment makes you feel good about yourself and improves your
skin's appearance, buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Makeup as well as skin care is an emotional purchase,'' said
Sam Fine, a New York-based celebrity makeup artist. ``If nothing
else, they help the mind. It says you care about your skin instead
of just waiting until your 40s and saying you're aging.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Zinn-Moore can attest to that. As senior vice president
of cosmetics and fragrance for Macy's East, she has seen wrinkle
creams take up more and more space on cosmetics counters. Cosmetics
manufacturers know that boomers want to defy the inevitable, so
they're giving them plenty to chose from.
</P>
<P>
   ``All women want to look young, and all women don't want surgery
or can't afford it,'' Zinn-Moore said. ``So they will try the
newest product on the market. I know I do.''
</P>
<P>
   HOLDING THE LINE ON AGING
</P>
<P>
   Want to slow down the signs of aging? Here's what experts
recommend to minimize fine lines, sagging skin and wrinkles:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Always use a sunscreen when in the sun, regardless of skin
color or ethnicity. Wear a hat and sunglasses to avoid direct
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Start at an early age to keep your skin clean.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Give skin a rest by not sleeping in makeup.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In your 20s, start wearing a moisturizer with an SPF to keep
skin soft and supple. Choose the right formula for your skin type.
For example, oily skin doesn't need an oil-based moisturizer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  By the early 40s, you might need a foundation to even your
skin tone. Look for one that will moisturize.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Moisturizers are critical for women in their 50s, as skin
starts to thin. Be prepared to change products for aging skin.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hypo-allergenic products are good for sensitive skin. Be
prepared to change products if skin becomes irritated after a
second or third use.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Chemical peels, Retin-A and products containing alpha hydroxy
acids that are prescribed by a dermatologist or other licensed
practitioner are more effective than over-the-counter products.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask to try a sample before making a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  When purchasing anti-aging products over the counter, look for
ones with glycolic acid or lactic acid. Even though they do not
work as aggressively as prescribed formulas, dermatologists say
they help the face look rejuvenated by exfoliating dead skin.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Follow instructions. If it says use twice a day, don't use it
more often. There's a valid reason why it shouldn't be used, say,
six times a day.

   COXNET-WHEELS-COX (Undated) _ North American buyers may not
immediately think of Audi when station wagons are mentioned, but
the European manufacturer actually has commonality with those
vehicles traditionally regarded as family haulers _ primarily,
change. Like the new-for-'99 A6 Avant, both Audi and station wagons
in general are putting the past far behind them. By Russ DeVault.
</P>
<P>
   SHARP DRIVING-COX (Undated) _ The most common perception of the
term platform is it means the vehicles share the same floor plan or
metal stamping that constitutes the ``floor'' of the car. That may
be the case on a shared-platform vehicle, but not necessarily. By
Linda Sharp.
</P>

   SHARP-DRIVING-COX (Undated) _ A look at the Mazda Protege. By

   AUTO-REVIEW-BOS (Undated) _ Even if the Wrangler isn't my
father's Jeep, I'm still glad it isn't my son's, either. By Bill
Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-SMART-ISUZU (Undated) _ Imaginative product planners have
morphed sedans with pickups, four-by-four's with minivans, military
vehicles with station wagons. Isn't it about time somebody crossed
a sport utility with a UFO? From the looks of it, Isuzu, the
Japanese car company, has come close with its Vehicross. A product
of the Star Wars school of design, this stubby, swoopy two-door
looks, quite simply, like nothing else on the road _ or on the
planet, for that matter. By James G. Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT-CARS-GRAND-VITARA (Undated) _ It sound likes a Middle
Eastern potentate or a virility enhancer, but the Grand Vitara is
actually the first well-rounded sport utility vehicle Suzuki has
offered in the United States. Previous models like the tippy
Samurai and the tinny Sidekick were simply not competent enough to
be taken seriously. The Grand Vitara competes in a four-door
compact utility segment that includes the Isuzu Amigo, Kia
Sportage, Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Subaru Forester and its own
assembly-line twins, the Chevrolet (formerly Geo) Tracker and
Suzuki (plain, not Grand) Vitara. By Keith Martin.

A FAST-TALKING SCALPER MAKES A PITCH FOR LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Just the Ticket,'' Andy Garcia has one of the flashier
roles of his career as Gary Starke, a hyperkinetic, motormouthed
scalper who dashes frantically around New York importuning busloads
of Asian tourists to purchase tickets to events from basketball
games to museum exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   When it is announced that Pope John Paul II will visit the city
and conduct an Easter Mass at Yankee Stadium, Gary sees an
opportunity to make a big score, set his chaotic live in order and
win back the woman he loves, Linda Paliski (Andie MacDowell), an
aspiring chef. Come the big day, he arrives at the stadium
disguised as a nun.
</P>
<P>
   But a flashy leading role does not insure a credible or coherent
movie. As hard as Garcia works to spit out his best Al Pacino
imitation, the film, which aims toward a John Cassavetesesque
spontaneity and grittiness, is a mawkish, incoherent mess.
</P>
<P>
   Although shot on the streets of Manhattan, it fails to capture
the jostling, hard-edged texture of street life, and Gary's
personal and business relationships ring false. Ms. MacDowell, her
Southern accent more pronounced than usual, is miscast as a young
woman from the outer boroughs making her way in big, bad Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Gary's shabby circle of acquaintances who work as short-order
cooks and parking lot attendants look and act like leftover Damon
Runyon characters. The movie even throws in a forlorn pregnant
junkie (Laura Harris), who exists solely to show what a kindhearted
guy Gary is.
</P>
<P>
   But the most hopelessly sentimentalized character is Gary's
mentor, Benny Moran (Richard Bradford), whose one claim to fame,
which no one believes, is his friendship with the former
heavyweight boxing champion Joe Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   The story focuses on Gary's simultaneous efforts to win back
Linda, who has given up on him after eight years, and to carry off
his last big score while evading the police and the wrath of a
ruthless West Indian operator (Andre Blake) who is putting Gary out
of business.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, ``Just the Ticket,'' written and directed by
Richard Wenk, gives Garcia, who is the film's co-producer, some
chances to chew the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, he visits a store where Linda works as a clerk
selling appliances, and improvises a maniacal pitch that convinces
a customer to buy a 60-inch television set.
</P>
<P>
   In another, he persuades Linda to trash the kitchen of a wealthy
catering client (Irene Worth), who is portrayed as the world's
stingiest, most mean-spirited hostess. Their crowning touch is to
roll the roast about to be served in kitty litter. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES
</P>
<P>

JAZZ JAMS FOR THE NINTENDO SET: A FATHER PASSES THE TORCH SONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 Samuel G. Freedman, a professor of journalism at Columbia
University, is the author most recently of ``The Inheritance.''  
 By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 25 years as a jazz fan, I long ago learned to
savor the virtues of an 11 o'clock set, that crossroads of languid
ballads and fiery bop. But until I walked into Alice Tully Hall
last December, I had never been to one that sold Raisinets
alongside Cognac and had the occasional tangerine tumbling out of a
backpack and down the aisle. This concert was starting at 11  &UR; in
the morning &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Beside me sat my son, Aaron, notebook and pen at the ready. At 6
he was naive enough to want to be like his father, and I dreaded
the day he would awake to my failings. Because I wrote books, he
wrote books, and he had already filled half a shelf with tales of
sorcerers and gods. Lately, he'd been asking me, dead-serious, why
his works weren't available on Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I hoped, I could pass along another passion of mine, jazz.
When Aaron was an infant, I had dandled him to the polyrhythms of
Milton Nascimento, but as he grew older I felt somehow timid about
pressing on him a music as intricate and demanding as jazz. It took
enough paternal vigilance just to steer him clear of Raffi.
</P>
<P>
   Though more of a Bonnie Raitt fan herself, my wife, Cynthia,
encouraged me to subscribe to the Jazz for Young People series,
produced by Lincoln Center and presided over by the trumpeter and
composer Wynton Marsalis. From my mouth, the notion of spending a
few Saturdays at jazz shows would have dripped of self-interest;
from hers, it soared on wings of arts education. Given the opening,
I snatched it.
</P>
<P>
   So here Aaron and I sat amid a sold-out crowd, half of it
ranging from toddler to teen and the other half graying like me.
The audience was as casually integrated by race as any I remembered
from the club scene, even if it produced some sounds I never heard
at the Village Vanguard _ sniffles, whimpers, juice boxes being
sucked dry.
</P>
<P>
   We parents had lived long enough to see jazz finally win
acceptance as an American art form. The jazz program at Lincoln
Center enjoys the same institutional status there as the
Metropolitan Opera. And the seven-year-old series of children's
concerts, which continues Saturday with a program about Duke
Ellington, consciously models itself on Leonard Bernstein's
classical Young People's Concerts presented from 1958 to 1972.
</P>
<P>
   My jazz education had been of the informal and nocturnal sort.
It began at college in Wisconsin with an older friend on the campus
newspaper. He was listening to Sinatra when I was listening to
Jethro Tull, and at the time I thought him hopeless. But
occasionally late at night, driving back to the dorms from the
print shop, he would tune his car radio to catch ``The Best of All
Possible Worlds,'' Harry Abraham's jazz show out of Rochester, and
I understood some powerful disclosure was being made.
</P>
<P>
   When I moved to the New York area a few years later, I sought
out the sound. I flopped over the floor pillows in the Jazzmania
Society's loft as Cecil Bridgewater played, embarrassed and nearly
impoverished myself by showing up to hear Marian McPartland at the
Carlyle with a flannel shirt on my back and a small-town reporter's
salary in my pocket. I would shamble to bed at 3 or 4 a.m. and wake
the next afternoon to buy records.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the toddler next to us gummed a bagel, Aaron and I
watched Marsalis stride across the stage, Italian-cut suit draped
elegantly on his frame, trumpet and plunger in hand. Seven side
men, all turned out in similarly immaculate style, awaited him. And
on a music stand, instead of a fake book, rested a script from
which Marsalis, in true jazz fashion, would freely improvise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today,'' he explained, ``we're going to find out what makes a
jazz singer.'' As the pianist Renee Rosnes underscored him, he went
on, ``Singing jazz means improvising, singing blues, swinging,
playing with words _'' he paused to inspect his dapper self ``_ and
looking good doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the laughter died down, he guided the band into a New
Orleans syncopation of the spiritual ``Just a Closer Walk With
Thee.'' Aaron perched forward in his seat, then turned to me.
``It's the horns,'' he said excitedly. ``The horns make it a good
sound.''
</P>
<P>
   I had to agree. In all the years I had listened to Marsalis, I
had admired his music more than I had viscerally responded to it.
The one exception was ``Fathers and Sons,'' a record on which
Marsalis played with his mentor, his father Ellis, a pianist. On
that release, so joyous, so effervescent, Wynton Marsalis had laid
down the burden of being a prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   The same easy delight came through in his teaching. In his years
running the Jazz for Young People program, Marsalis has played
kazoo, cracked toothpaste jokes and dribbled a basketball to make
rhythm visible. On this morning, he demonstrated vibrato by shaking
his body along with his voice. Looking at his inspired looseness, I
remembered the time Bernstein used one of his televised concerts to
extol the Beatles' chord structure in ``Norwegian Wood.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as Marsalis led the band through Scott Joplin's
``Maple Leaf Rag,'' I spotted Aaron playing imaginary piano keys.
When Wycliffe Gordon put down his trombone to growl through the
Count Basie standard ``Goin' to Chicago Blues,'' I noticed Aaron
miming the bassist plucking away, then writing the name of the song
in his notebook.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The auditorium went dark as Marsalis introduced a film clip of
Louis Armstrong. Aaron asked me if I knew who he was. I started to
tell him about a poster of Armstrong I had at home, part of a
promotional campaign for a radio station that no longer exists, but
then I realized there was a much more personal story, and I
whispered a shorthand version of it beneath the soundtrack of
Armstrong doing ``Dinah.''
</P>
<P>
   My parents went for years to the same internist, Dr. Gary
Zucker, who treated Armstrong. In the waiting room one day, my
mother saw him emerge from an appointment, grabbed an envelope from
the receptionist and had the trumpeter autograph it for me. I was
perhaps 10 then, years away from even the Jethro Tull stage of my
listening life and, as far as I knew, my mother's taste ran to
classical music and flamenco guitar. Only after she died and I
found an orange crate of her Glenn Miller and Billy Eckstine
records in the basement did I understand why she had leaped to get
a jazzman's signature.
</P>
<P>
   On the Lincoln Center screen, Armstrong gave way to Billie
Holiday and then Ella Fitzgerald as Marsalis explained phrasing and
scatting. Milt Grayson, a guest vocalist with the band, turned his
oaken bass voice to a languorous version of ``Do Nothin' Till You
Hear From Me.'' I thought of a weekend 15 years earlier when I had
sat at the Blue Note bar two nights in a row to hear Johnny
Hartman. Now, in my concert seat, noon felt like midnight, sultry,
melancholy midnight.
</P>
<P>
   All the balladry, though, was taxing Aaron. He slumped down in
his seat, crossed his arms. There is a certain experience of love
and loss at the heart of any torch song that eludes a 6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting bored,'' Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
   The words chilled me. I'd heard them for one football season
after another in my futile effort to turn Aaron into a Giants fan.
His 4-year-old sister already showed more potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a few more songs,'' I pleaded, consulting the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to eat lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stay, we can have pancakes after.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then the tempo picked up, with some television clips of
Jimmy Rushing shouting the blues song ``Take Me Back, Baby.'' When
the guest vocalist, Sister Mekea Keith, dug into the bop
composition ``In Walked Bud,'' Aaron waved his tissue in time. We
left the auditorium after the chanting the ``doo-wah, doo-wah''
chorus of the final song, ``It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got
That Swing).''
</P>
<P>
   ``The concert was fun,'' Aaron announced over the promised
pancakes at a West Side diner. ``I decided I like jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home late that afternoon, I put on a Joe Williams CD so
Aaron could again hear the ``Goin' to Chicago Blues.'' Then I went
to my desk, opened a drawer of keepsakes and withdrew a yellowing
envelope inscribed with the autograph of Louis Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Performance Information

`SCHOOL OF FLESH': SHE LOVES HIM, BUT HE LOVES OTHERS, INCLUDING
MEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The School of Flesh,'' that wonderfully complicated French
actress Isabelle Huppert demonstrates an uncanny ability to weep
buckets while remaining poker-faced, her tears appearing to emanate
from a realm somewhere beyond feeling.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity between Ms. Huppert's copious tears and her
apparent calm makes watching the movie, filmed by Benoit Jacquot,
the acclaimed French director of ``A Single Girl'' and ``Seventh
Heaven,'' a little confusing. For ``The School of Flesh'' is about
the greedy, unfettered carnal passion of two people and the
desperate power games it leads them to play.
</P>
<P>
   But because there are so few signs of genuine passion between
the lovers, the movie often seems like a terrific idea that fell
into the wrong hands. Watching this handsomely filmed, deftly
edited but rather dry movie, you keep imagining the juice that a
director like Pedro Almodovar could have squeezed out of the same
story.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from a novel by Yukio Mishima, ``The School of Flesh''
explores the relationship of a well-to-do Parisian woman in the
fashion business who falls madly in love with a much younger,
working-class boxer and bisexual hustler.
</P>
<P>
   Her lover, Quentin (Vincent Martinez), whom she picks up in a
gay bar after some heated eye contact, is a wiry, glowering young
stud who resembles a tougher, surlier Joaquin Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Their power struggle begins on their very first date, at an
arcade where Quentin, who loves video games, becomes so absorbed he
barely notices her. Dominique walks away in disappointment, then
suddenly changes her mind and returns.
</P>
<P>
   She is already hooked. Although she has been planning to pay for
his sexual services, during their first night together the
chemistry is so hot that in the morning he refuses to take her
money. Dominique impulsively decides to keep her new boyfriend. And
after consultations with Chris (Vincent Lindon), an employee in the
nightclub where Quentin works as a bartender, she secretly pays off
Quentin's debts and later comes to an arrangement in which she
gives him an allowance but permits him certain freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Chris, who himself used to keep Quentin and who may also have
pimped for him, is one of the more unbelievable gay characters to
appear in a recent movie. A burly hirsute man who wears earrings
and eye shadow and walks with a flounce but still dresses like a
man, he suggests a garish ``La Cage Aux Folles''-inspired fantasy
figure.
</P>
<P>
   Chris is given to tossing off shrill declarations like ``I am 
girl'' that sound at once false and dated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The School of Flesh'' is the rare movie in which there isn't
enough sex. And the lovemaking that's shown is so tepid and
mechanically detached that the lovers' physical bond is never
discernible. All it would have taken to set this film's thermostat
at an appropriately high temperature is one brief scene like the
lovers' first encounter in Brigitte Rouan's 1998 film ``Post
Coitum, Animal Triste,'' a movie that deals with many of the same
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique and Quentin have the usual troubles that such
arrangements bring. Despite her better instincts, Dominique becomes
prying and possessive. She goes through Quentin's belongings and
interviews a prominent lawyer who once kept him.
</P>
<P>
   When Quentin disappears, she tracks him down to a remote street
corner where he is busily selling his body to male clients.
Everyone Dominique meets, however, assures her that Quentin really
prefers women. Eventually, she finds herself competing for
Quentin's affections with the teen-age daughter of one of her
closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   Although a lot happens, by the end of the film we know very
little more about what makes its characters tick than we knew at
the beginning. The emotions the movie deals with _ intense sexual
passion, jealousy, possessiveness and insecurity compounded by
differences of age and class _ are incendiary.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The School of Flesh'' insists on holding them at arm's
length, as though they are too hot to handle.

`200 CIGARETTES': SO, HOW WAS YOUR NEW YEAR'S EVE? SMOKIN'! 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)

   Risa Bramon Garcia is a well-known casting director, and she
directs her first feature by doing what she does best: cast. The
MTV-produced ``200 Cigarettes'' gathers a partyful of young players
and barely gives them enough of a story line to puff on, but it
gets by on personality anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   It's no ``Smoke,'' but this loosely interwoven set of sketches,
breezily derivative of ``American Graffiti,'' does throw its
characters together in a New York setting on a conveniently fateful
night in each of their lives. The year is 1981, and all you need to
know about the story is that each reveler eventually finds a new
mate on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``200 Cigarettes'' is a chain-smoking shambles, but an enjoyable
one. It not only has nicotine poisoning but also 49 party songs on
its soundtrack, including a raga surf selection that's a hoot in
its own right. Its East Village setting is given a cool, zany look
that's fun even when a few of the characters become unduly grating.
</P>
<P>
   As two would-be groupies from Ronkonkoma, N.Y., Christina Ricci
and Gaby Hoffmann inflict braying accents that stop being funny
fast, and Jay Mohr is stuck with the one-note role of a vain
ladykiller. Kate Hudson, who is Goldie Hawn's daughter and has her
mother's grin and giggle, makes her feature debut adorably despite
being asked to spend part of the movie with dog excrement on her
coat.
</P>
<P>
   The funniest performances here come from Martha Plimpton as a
nervous wreck of a hostess, Dave Chappelle as the driver of a
tiger-upholstered disco taxi, Paul Rudd as a roguishly charming
birthday celebrant and Janeane Garofalo as his bad-tempered ex.
(Ms. Garofalo's entrance is the best moment in the movie.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the story's amusing, unlikely swains are Casey Affleck as
a nice-guy punk, Brian McCardie as a Scotsman mocked as a lousy
lover and even Elvis Costello.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd's Kevin spends the evening drifting around town with his
best friend, Lucy; though as played by Courtney Love, Lucy doesn't
much seem like anybody's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy and Kevin might start a halfhearted affair if she weren't
so busy bagging a smug, handsome bartender (Ben Affleck) who has a
few memorable pickup lines of his own. Like: ``My clothes and those
clothes would look good on my floor.'' And: ``By the way, how do
you like your eggs in the morning? Scrambled or fertilized?''
</P>
<P>
   Lurking behind the studied debauchery in a film (written by
Shana Larsen) that really boils down to smoking, drinking and
finding one-night stands, is an affecting sense that this
particular party is about to be over.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS and yuppiehood are just beyond the horizon, as witnessed by
the way Ben Affleck's character voices a secret yen to get into
real estate law. ``Punk was dying, and people were looking for
something to believe in,'' McCardie has said about the film's 1981
ethos. ``They chose Jane Fonda's workout video.''
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES
</P>
<P>
   ``200 Cigarettes'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual references, mild
profanity and heavy emphasis on smoking and drinking throughout.

CAGE AND DIRECTOR PROJECT COOL FOR `8MM'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By  BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Most people who work in the Hollywood movie
industry would not view a story about illegal pornography, violent
sadomasochism and thrill killing as an opportunity to tone things
down.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are people like Nicolas Cage and Joel Schumacher,
who rather remarkably took the subdued approach with their latest
release, the snuff film/mystery thriller ``8mm.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he became an action-movie hero, Cage won an Oscar for
portraying the most intractable of alcoholics in ``Leaving Las
Vegas.'' But that was just one of many extreme, outre performances
that have come before and since, in ``Peggy Sue Got Married,''
``Raising Arizona,'' ``Vampire's Kiss,'' ``Wild at Heart,'' ``Kiss
of Death,'' ``Face/Off'' and, most recently, ``Snake Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Schumacher is also known for his wild hair (both
literally and figuratively). Although long considered a reliable
supplier of commercial studio product (``St. Elmo's Fire,'' ``The
Client,'' ``A Time to Kill,'' ``Batman Forever'' and ``Batman and
Robin''), Schumacher has an ultrabusy style that turns even the
most mundane material into colorful, noisy sensory assaults. And,
sometimes, he ventures into unexpectedly inflammatory (the
controversial ``Falling Down'') and just plain weird
(``Flatliners'') territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``8mm'' is a trip into terra incognito if ever there was one.
Cage plays a strait-laced Pennsylvania private detective who, in
trying to determine whether a snuff film is real or staged,
journeys through the Dante-esque sexual underworlds of New York and
L.A.
</P>
<P>
   While searching for the young ``star'' of the reel, Cage's Tom
Welles is exposed to sleazy sex merchants, far-out fetishists and
kiddie porn peddlers. He more or less maintains his professional
composure until he uncovers a callous, exploitative subculture of
torture-loving kidnappers. At that juncture, even he has trouble
controlling his own darkest impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Until that point late in the film, however, Cage plays Welles
with the utmost steadiness and simplicity. As underplaying goes,
it's subtler than his work in last year's ``City of Angels.'' And
that was a romance in which Cage portrayed a gentle celestial
being, not a private eye surrounded by danger and debauchery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an experiment,'' Cage admits. ``I like guys like Steve
McQueen, who seem to be able to resonate or be larger than life
doing, well, nothing. I think the power in that was the power of
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I said to Joel, `Can I try going the other way, like the
old maxim of less is more, and see if this works? I'm just curious.
I haven't really done it.' And he said, `Yeah, we should both grow
from this movie in some way. You and I have both been given to
flash _ let's try to go in the other direction.' Which is what we
did, and I'm pretty pleased with the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his record of on-screen pyrotechnics, the 35-year-old
Cage's personality is naturally analytical, calm and deliberate. On
the other hand Schumacher, 59, is a former costume designer known
for his personal flair and effusive demeanor. But he found toning
down his creative style just as refreshing as Cage did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had both had luck with more theatrical, showoffy work, if
you will,'' Schumacher says. ``It was time for us, individually, to
work on a more restrained, more internalized, more inwardly
developed level.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Schumacher's last film, ``Batman and Robin,'' hit such
heights (or depths) of overpumped bombast, it threatened to destroy
the superhero franchise with sheer screechiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to get out of the summer corridor because the box
office had become more important than the movie, and it scared
me,'' Schumacher admits of his blockbuster-making period. ``It was
like the only game you ever played was the Super Bowl; you never
got to have any of the games before it. It's been very good to me,
I'm not complaining, but by `Batman and Robin' I started to lose a
little of myself. I needed to get back to just telling the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Understandable. But a story as unappealing as ``8mm's,'' which
was written by ``Seven'' scribe Andrew Kevin Walker, seems as
perverse a move _ from a commercial standpoint, anyway _ as some of
the kinkier sex practices the movie depicts. Cage acknowledges that
the movie dances on the borderline of prurience, but he insists
that the smarmy details are just window dressing for a character
piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of aware that this stuff was out there, although I
hadn't really seen any,'' Cage says of illegal pornography, which
the filmmakers define as films and videos that combine violence
with graphic sex and child porn. (There is no evidence that snuff
films, the fabled reels of someone actually being killed for
viewers' voyeuristic pleasure, really exist). ``But what attracted
me was the character.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an actor, I have to find new ways of being interested in my
work so that it stays interesting for the audience. Sometimes, that
means I have to look in places that push the envelope or are more
risky. I can either fall on my face in this experiment or grow from
it or do something new. ``8mm'' seemed very risky and appealed to
me; it wasn't your standard studio movie.''
</P>
<P>
   That's for sure. But Schumacher questions whether anyone in
post-Monica America will find anything in his picture truly
shocking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always make films on the theory that the audience is as
sophisticated as we are,'' Schumacher says. ``In a lot of media,
and in a lot of the Hollywood film industry, there's this attitude
that the audience is like children. `Don't tell them that! They
can't handle that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But just think of what everyone in the United States has had
to deal with in the last two years _ and on television. Oral sex
and DNA and ethnic cleansing ... I mean, what is it, in this day
and age, that anyone thinks they don't know about out there? Ten
billion was spent on the sex business in the United States alone,
just in the last year. All of this is on the Internet, including
kiddie porn.''
</P>
<P>
   It was ``8mm's'' righteous violence, rather than its carnal
content, that most concerned Cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are different factions of the pornography
audience,'' Cage says. ``There are a lot of lonely people out there
who it provides a release for, and I don't see anything wrong with
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think that's what's going on in `8mm.' I see this
more as an examination of the horrors that can happen to young
people who run away. On a symbolic level, Tom Welles is an
amalgamation of a lot of people in America who are frustrated and
angered by what they hear on the news. I know I get angry when I
hear about a horrible thing that happened to a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason why Cage played it so cool through so much of
the movie was that he genuinely didn't trust himself when it came
time to act out Welles' anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violent scenes are a little tricky for me because, as an
actor, I try to trick my mind into thinking I'm really there,''
Cage says. ``That's because I want to do it with some level of
authenticity. But over the years, I've noticed that you can go so
far there that it's kind of scary. Luckily, Joel made sure that the
set was always cool, that no one crossed the line and everyone
really controlled themselves. That was helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher confirms that, however startling ``8mm's'' sexual
imagery may be, the film's truly disturbing aspects are its
physical and psychic brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one thing I know, having lived awhile on the
planet Earth,'' the director says. ``There is no atrocity that you
can dream of that someone hasn't done, and done worse than you ever
dreamed. There is violence in us. We like to think that it's just
an aberrant person here and there, but we know deep down that it
isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual for you to turn on your television and see
that some adult has raped and murdered a child again,'' Schumacher
adds. ``You say, `How can a human being do this?' Because they
wanted to, that's why. There are lots of movies about serial
killers, but that's too easy because a serial killer is a crazy
person and we can chalk them off.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about deeper evil than that. It's about people who
just don't care; human life just is not of any concern to them.'' &UR;

`FREAKS UNCENSORED!': AND HERE, A CHILD SOLD BY A DISGUSTED MOTHER
AND FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)

 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those drawn to the world of circuses, sideshows, amusement
parks and carnivals, ``Freaks Uncensored!'' possesses the appeal of
a well-stuffed scrapbook.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping archives and private collections, this documentary,
opening Friday for a run through Sunday at Anthology Film Archives
in Manhattan, sprints through the history and lore of the unusual
people who have been gaped and gawked at by everyone from royalty
and scientists to so-called ordinary people and their offspring
strolling a midway while a barker beckons.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who steps right up to ``Freaks Uncensored,'' directed and
edited by Ari Roussimoff and produced by Vivian Forlander, will see
plenty of odd and malformed humanity, from so-called giants, whose
height was usually exaggerated, to bearded ladies, dwarfs and
midgets, armless and legless men and women, four-legged people,
conjoined twins, human pincushions and other sideshow attractions.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, the film sheds historical light on people like
Jo-Jo the Russian Dog-Faced Man and some of the actors like the
Hilton twins, Johnny Eck, Zip and Pip and Schlitzie, who appeared
in Tod Browning's 1932 classic, ``Freaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Remarkable film clips show a splendid German tenor whose height
of four feet denied him a career in opera, and the armless Carl
Unthan, whose dexterous feet enabled him to play the trumpet, deal
cards, remove the cork from a bottle and pour drinks into tiny
glasses.
</P>
<P>
   But for its commentary and narrative, ``Freaks Uncensored!''
relies too heavily on people already involved in the sideshow
milieu or attracted to it, like the young bearded lady Madame
Xenobia (Jennifer Miller); James Taylor, the author and publisher
of the sideshow periodical Shocked and Amazed; David F. Friedman, a
carnival entrepreneur and exploitation film producer, and Jack
Dracula, the tattooed wonder.
</P>
<P>
   For those who know 42nd Street and Times Square only in its
Disneyfied renaissance, Jack Dracula proves an instructive guide as
scenes of the old Hubert's Flea Circus premises unreel.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Freaks Uncensored!'' makes clear that the
malformations and anomalies it shows are largely of a nature now
well understood by medicine and science, the film would be improved
by the presence of a few dispassionate expert voices to discuss
these conditions and the psychological impact of sideshow life on
individuals sometimes abandoned or sold by their parents as well as
to analyze and assess the impulses that continue to draw audiences
to these exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   When the film wanders off for a while into Hitler's
extermination of the abnormal and Jesus' kindness to lepers, there
is an inescapable feeling that ``Freaks Uncensored!,'' though
compassionate, is weighted heavily toward the curiosity component
of sideshow life and has ventured into depths it is ill-equipped to
deal with.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the historical value of its content, ``Freaks
Uncensored!'' offers a lively and eclectic score by John Watts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest wisdom imparted by this film comes from the
malformed Jeanie Tomaini, billed as the last living circus
half-lady, who says she has yet to meet a normal person.

BATTLE LINES DRAWN OVER CALIFORNIA GOP LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The nuns and priests who read the San
Francisco Faith newsletter may have found mild interest in an
interview last month with John McGraw, the self-described Irish
Catholic vice chairman of the state Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But McGraw's comment that ``killing our babies ... is the issue
of the century'' was immediately pounced upon by an abortion-rights
faction of the Republican Party, opening a nasty debate just as the
GOP is attempting to repair its damaged image.
</P>
<P>
   Possible Republican presidential candidates, including Elizabeth
Dole, former Vice President Dan Quayle and Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, arrive here this weekend for the state GOP convention. But
the candidates' beauty pageant threatens to be overshadowed by
McGraw's interview with the obscure Catholic newsletter and the
turmoil it created.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect this would trigger a civil war in the
California GOP,'' said San Francisco Faith editor George Neumayr,
who interviewed McGraw only because he thought it was interesting
that a ``traditional'' Catholic would rise so high in the party.
``I certainly wasn't trying to stir up trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   But McGraw, 37, opened his mouth. Although none of his comments
should surprise anyone familiar with devout Catholics or
conservative Republicans, they have forced McGraw to defend himself
and have jeopardized his once-certain chance to become state party
chairman this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy highlights the Republican Party's continuing
struggle to define itself with voters more interested in
kitchen-table issues such as health reform and education than
abortion or gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to reach out to minority communities and women,
and his comments were not in good judgment,'' said Nicholas Bavaro,
who is challenging McGraw for the state party's top post. ``The
California Republican Party needs to elect a chairman, not a
pope.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of state Republicans is attempting to remove a portion
of the GOP platform that opposes abortion. Another faction wants
the platform left alone and GOP campaign money withheld from
politicians who don't support a ban on late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, McGraw said bishops should withhold communion
from Catholic politicians who support abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can they go out and actively lobby for something that is
fundamentally opposed to one of the basic teachings of our
church?'' he told the Faith.
</P>
<P>
   But McGraw gave the pro-choice Republican camp its greatest
weapon when he told the Faith, ``The most important issue by far is
the abortion issue. I don't care what anybody says ... Killing our
babies ... is the issue of the century ... Compared to that,
cutting taxes or any other issue pales in comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the centrist image the Republican Party wants to
project, particularly after the November elections. The party's
anti-abortion gubernatorial candidate, Dan Lungren, lost by a wide
margin. Dave Stirling, the anti-abortion candidate for attorney
general, lost to a Democrat by 10 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats gained a large majority in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party has an identity crisis and we allowed
Democrats to take our issues. They killed us,'' said Bavaro, 46, a
self-described ``blue-collar'' Republican from Modesto who
announced four weeks ago that he was challenging McGraw for the
chairmanship.
</P>

   ``I respect Mr. McGraw's points of view, but the interview (with
the Faith) was not conducted with him as a person; it was about him
being the next chairman of the Republican Party,'' Bavaro said.

   McGraw has avoided talking to the news media. He recently issued
a statement saying the interview with the Faith ``reflects my
personal moral priorities'' and contended the party represents a
``diverse and broad spectrum of members who come together behind
certain core beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that one should be able to discuss his or her moral
priorities as a Catholic without having them confused with the
priorities of the California Republican Party,'' McGraw said in the
statement. ``I regret if there has been any confusion on this
point.''

CAGE AND DIRECTOR PROJECT COOL FOR `8MM'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by SLANG partners -- Attn: Liz Smilor)  
By  BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Most people who work in the Hollywood movie
industry would not view a story about illegal pornography, violent
sadomasochism and thrill killing as an opportunity to tone things
down.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are people like Nicolas Cage and Joel Schumacher,
who rather remarkably took the subdued approach with their latest
release, the snuff film/mystery thriller ``8mm.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he became an action-movie hero, Cage won an Oscar for
portraying the most intractable of alcoholics in ``Leaving Las
Vegas.'' But that was just one of many extreme, outre performances
that have come before and since, in ``Peggy Sue Got Married,''
``Raising Arizona,'' ``Vampire's Kiss,'' ``Wild at Heart,'' ``Kiss
of Death,'' ``Face/Off'' and, most recently, ``Snake Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Schumacher is also known for his wild hair (both
literally and figuratively). Although long considered a reliable
supplier of commercial studio product (``St. Elmo's Fire,'' ``The
Client,'' ``A Time to Kill,'' ``Batman Forever'' and ``Batman and
Robin''), Schumacher has an ultrabusy style that turns even the
most mundane material into colorful, noisy sensory assaults. And,
sometimes, he ventures into unexpectedly inflammatory (the
controversial ``Falling Down'') and just plain weird
(``Flatliners'') territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``8mm'' is a trip into terra incognito if ever there was one.
Cage plays a strait-laced Pennsylvania private detective who, in
trying to determine whether a snuff film is real or staged,
journeys through the Dante-esque sexual underworlds of New York and
L.A.
</P>
<P>
   While searching for the young ``star'' of the reel, Cage's Tom
Welles is exposed to sleazy sex merchants, far-out fetishists and
kiddie porn peddlers. He more or less maintains his professional
composure until he uncovers a callous, exploitative subculture of
torture-loving kidnappers. At that juncture, even he has trouble
controlling his own darkest impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Until that point late in the film, however, Cage plays Welles
with the utmost steadiness and simplicity. As underplaying goes,
it's subtler than his work in last year's ``City of Angels.'' And
that was a romance in which Cage portrayed a gentle celestial
being, not a private eye surrounded by danger and debauchery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an experiment,'' Cage admits. ``I like guys like Steve
McQueen, who seem to be able to resonate or be larger than life
doing, well, nothing. I think the power in that was the power of
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I said to Joel, `Can I try going the other way, like the
old maxim of less is more, and see if this works? I'm just curious.
I haven't really done it.' And he said, `Yeah, we should both grow
from this movie in some way. You and I have both been given to
flash _ let's try to go in the other direction.' Which is what we
did, and I'm pretty pleased with the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his record of on-screen pyrotechnics, the 35-year-old
Cage's personality is naturally analytical, calm and deliberate. On
the other hand Schumacher, 59, is a former costume designer known
for his personal flair and effusive demeanor. But he found toning
down his creative style just as refreshing as Cage did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had both had luck with more theatrical, showoffy work, if
you will,'' Schumacher says. ``It was time for us, individually, to
work on a more restrained, more internalized, more inwardly
developed level.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Schumacher's last film, ``Batman and Robin,'' hit such
heights (or depths) of overpumped bombast, it threatened to destroy
the superhero franchise with sheer screechiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to get out of the summer corridor because the box
office had become more important than the movie, and it scared
me,'' Schumacher admits of his blockbuster-making period. ``It was
like the only game you ever played was the Super Bowl; you never
got to have any of the games before it. It's been very good to me,
I'm not complaining, but by `Batman and Robin' I started to lose a
little of myself. I needed to get back to just telling the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Understandable. But a story as unappealing as ``8mm's,'' which
was written by ``Seven'' scribe Andrew Kevin Walker, seems as
perverse a move _ from a commercial standpoint, anyway _ as some of
the kinkier sex practices the movie depicts. Cage acknowledges that
the movie dances on the borderline of prurience, but he insists
that the smarmy details are just window dressing for a character
piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of aware that this stuff was out there, although I
hadn't really seen any,'' Cage says of illegal pornography, which
the filmmakers define as films and videos that combine violence
with graphic sex and child porn. (There is no evidence that snuff
films, the fabled reels of someone actually being killed for
viewers' voyeuristic pleasure, really exist). ``But what attracted
me was the character.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an actor, I have to find new ways of being interested in my
work so that it stays interesting for the audience. Sometimes, that
means I have to look in places that push the envelope or are more
risky. I can either fall on my face in this experiment or grow from
it or do something new. ``8mm'' seemed very risky and appealed to
me; it wasn't your standard studio movie.''
</P>
<P>
   That's for sure. But Schumacher questions whether anyone in
post-Monica America will find anything in his picture truly
shocking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always make films on the theory that the audience is as
sophisticated as we are,'' Schumacher says. ``In a lot of media,
and in a lot of the Hollywood film industry, there's this attitude
that the audience is like children. `Don't tell them that! They
can't handle that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But just think of what everyone in the United States has had
to deal with in the last two years _ and on television. Oral sex
and DNA and ethnic cleansing ... I mean, what is it, in this day
and age, that anyone thinks they don't know about out there? Ten
billion was spent on the sex business in the United States alone,
just in the last year. All of this is on the Internet, including
kiddie porn.''
</P>
<P>
   It was ``8mm's'' righteous violence, rather than its carnal
content, that most concerned Cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are different factions of the pornography
audience,'' Cage says. ``There are a lot of lonely people out there
who it provides a release for, and I don't see anything wrong with
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think that's what's going on in `8mm.' I see this
more as an examination of the horrors that can happen to young
people who run away. On a symbolic level, Tom Welles is an
amalgamation of a lot of people in America who are frustrated and
angered by what they hear on the news. I know I get angry when I
hear about a horrible thing that happened to a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason why Cage played it so cool through so much of
the movie was that he genuinely didn't trust himself when it came
time to act out Welles' anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violent scenes are a little tricky for me because, as an
actor, I try to trick my mind into thinking I'm really there,''
Cage says. ``That's because I want to do it with some level of
authenticity. But over the years, I've noticed that you can go so
far there that it's kind of scary. Luckily, Joel made sure that the
set was always cool, that no one crossed the line and everyone
really controlled themselves. That was helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher confirms that, however startling ``8mm's'' sexual
imagery may be, the film's truly disturbing aspects are its
physical and psychic brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one thing I know, having lived awhile on the
planet Earth,'' the director says. ``There is no atrocity that you
can dream of that someone hasn't done, and done worse than you ever
dreamed. There is violence in us. We like to think that it's just
an aberrant person here and there, but we know deep down that it
isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual for you to turn on your television and see
that some adult has raped and murdered a child again,'' Schumacher
adds. ``You say, `How can a human being do this?' Because they
wanted to, that's why. There are lots of movies about serial
killers, but that's too easy because a serial killer is a crazy
person and we can chalk them off.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about deeper evil than that. It's about people who
just don't care; human life just is not of any concern to them.'' &UR;

`BLIND FAITH': TRAGEDY AT HOME AND IN THE COURTROOM FOR A BLACK
YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The courtroom drama ``Blind Faith,'' directed with conviction
and restraint by Ernest Dickerson, describes a hate crime and the
miscarriage of justice that it engenders.
</P>
<P>
   With a first-rate performance by Courtney B. Vance as an
embattled defense attorney, it manages to explore more kinds of
prejudice than might be expected. Receiving a theatrical release a
year after it aired on Showtime, it looks all too timely today.
</P>
<P>
   Set mostly in 1957 with a quick opening reference to the 1989
murder of Yusuf Hawkins by a mob of white youths in Bensonhurst,
the story revolves around three black brothers. John ( Vance) is
the decent lawyer trying to get a career started. Eddie (Kadeem
Harrison) is the reefer-smoking, jazz-playing brother regarded as a
ne'er-do-well by Charles (Charles S. Dutton), a stern police
officer with rigid ideas about how his relatives ought to behave.
</P>
<P>
   It is Charles' son, Charlie (Garland Witt), who is seen first as
a nice boy hoping to take art lessons and, next thing the audience
knows, is being held on a murder charge. He is accused of having
strangled a white boy. And the only known witnesses to the crime
are the white boy's white friends.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie has already signed a confession, which makes John's
legal maneuvering even trickier than it would otherwise be. But
John eventually discovers, in a well-delineated if overly tidy way,
that the events surrounding the murder are not what they seem.
</P>
<P>
   And he realizes that Charlie faces an even tougher battle at
home than he does in the courtroom. A sharply manipulative turn
late in the story makes Charlie's plight even more tragic than it
first seemed, and ultimately sends the viewer home with a lesson to
be learned.
</P>
<P>
   What gives ``Blind Faith'' its forceful tone is the actors'
intense interaction, especially in scenes between Dutton and Vance.
It's also notable here that in a cast that also includes Lonette
McKee (as Charles' wife and Charlie's mother), strong language is
used sparingly and with care.
</P>
<P>
   Though the case itself is an obscenity and could well prompt
obscene talk, the film (written by Frank Military) saves its
harshest language for a scene in which Charles finally explodes.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from so stern a character, these words really mean
something, and get right to the reason why ``Blind Faith'' is a
father-son tragedy in the end.

`8MM' WALLOWS IN THE SLEAZE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients  on Friday, Feb. 26 or
thereafter ) 
OUR RATING: 2 STAR S 
By  BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the thoroughly unpleasant ``8mm,'' Nicolas
Cage does a 180 from his performance in his last intolerable
thriller, ``Snake Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The previous film boasted an eye-popping, over-the-top attempt
to distract us from its nonsensical cluelessness; in this one, Cage
plays it so grave and depressive that our attention repeatedly
drifts away from him. We end up wallowing in ``8mm's'' deviant,
clammy atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   It's not anything you want to be exposed to for extended lengths
of time.
</P>
<P>
   Cage plays Tom Welles, a working-class guy whose impressive
self-control and discretion has lifted him up to the status of
Pennsylvania high society's favorite private eye. Married to a
well-bred writer (Catherine Keener) and the father of a baby
daughter, Welles lives in a picturesque little house beside a
pleasant, woodsy creek.
</P>
<P>
   That he doesn't seem to mind spending much of his time away on
business and gets a kind of perverse pleasure out of lying to his
wife about quitting smoking would perhaps indicate some dark
resentment roiling beneath Welles' buttoned-down veneer.
</P>
<P>
   But nah, the script does take Welles on a nightmare journey in
which his assumptions about himself are confronted and tested, but
what's revealed is a pretty simple, standard bent for
self-righteous vigilantism. Writer Andrew Kevin Walker doesn't
bring out the complexities of motivation he got at in his superior
script for ``Seven,'' let alone the kind of character
contradictions initially hinted at here.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Welles is hired by a super-wealthy widow to quietly
investigate a reel of film depicting a teen-age girl apparently
being murdered _ the proverbial snuff film _ that was found in her
late husband's private safe. She wants reassurance that the sick
production was staged, that the unknown girl is still alive. Money,
of course, is no obstacle, so the case becomes Welles' quest.
</P>
<P>
   An extended stretch of detective grunt work leads Welles to a
tentative identification of the victim, then to the film's best
scenes: meetings with the long-missing girl's sad, lonely mother,
magnificently played by Amy Morton as a woman whose hopelessness
gives her a strange kind of sustenance. The trail then meanders to
Hollywood's porno underworld, where Welles descends deeper and
deeper into the purgatory of extra-legal fetish stuff: hard-core
domination, kiddie porn, fake snuff.
</P>
<P>
   His guide through these circles of desire is Max Hollywood
(Joaquin Phoenix), an aspiring musician and adult-bookstore clerk
who proves a resourceful, goofy font of hidden knowledge. Welles
eventually locates a sleazy, X-video producer (James Gandolfini,
overdoing the ooze) and a New York director of bizarre
``specialty'' films (Peter Stormare, overdoing everything). From
there, things get bloody, obsessive, demented ... but not
necessarily any better than the low-key passages that dragged on
before.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Joel Schumacher, best-known for his ``Batman''
sequels and John Grisham potboilers. He is obviously reaching for
something deeper and more stirring with ``8mm,'' but the execution
is too often superficial and confused. A film with this kind of
degraded subject matter has to be sharply insightful and resonate
deeply, like a ``Boogie Nights'' did, to justify itself. Otherwise,
it just comes off as exploitative.
</P>
<P>
   You can see Schumacher trying to get at something serious
throughout ``8mm,'' but he's overwhelmed by the film's tawdry
elements. When you roll around in this stuff, it's hard to not look
dirty.

``THE OTHER SISTER'': THE GODS MAY BE LONG, BUT YOU CAN BET ON
LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A beautifully acted love story about two mentally challenged
young people struggling for independence and self-respect, ``The
Other Sister'' is a movie that's so eager to please it includes not
just one but two triumphal wedding scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Those two scenes give this lumbering, overlong movie successive
endings that feel clumsily tacked together, not to mention
manipulative. At one of the ceremonies, the participants re-enact a
variation of the wedding at the end of ``The Graduate,'' a film to
which ``The Other Sister'' alludes so frequently and shamelessly
that the references smack of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the song ``Mrs. Robinson'' (performed by the
Lemonheads) is even recycled for strained dramatic effect.
</P>
<P>
   The need for all this candy-coating and referential weight is
understandable, given the movie's subject. For ``The Other Sister''
focuses so intensely on the problems facing Carla (Juliette Lewis),
24, a spunky mentally retarded woman trying to make her way in the
world after being discharged from a special school, that while
watching the film you often share the frustration of her
overprotective, high-powered mother, Elizabeth (Diane Keaton).
</P>
<P>
   When Carla falls in love with Danny (Giovanni Ribisi), a young
man whose mental impairment is a bit more severe than hers, the
scenes of the two making elaborate plans to have sex press
uncomfortable emotional buttons. The movie dares you to feel a
derisive superiority.
</P>
<P>
   What redeems the film, directed by Garry Marshall, who gave us
``Pretty Woman,'' are its three outstanding performances. The
gawky, shining-eyed, stubbornly willful Carla is played by Ms.
Lewis with enormous heart and sensitivity, and with body language
so precise that you soon forget it is a performance.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Keaton's finely nuanced portrait of a kind of maternal
perfectionist and overachieving Martha Stewart type we all know
finds her character's soul beneath her irritatingly high-strung
surface. The boldest performance of all is Ribisi's Danny, a mostly
endearing character who at moments can seem repulsive, even a
little monstrous.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins with Carla's return from the school to the
bosom of her well-to-do family. Once Carla is home, Elizabeth
expects her daughter to study art, learn to play tennis and conform
as much as possible to the image of a genteel West Coast woman of
means. She had always assumed that Carla would remain a child
requiring parental supervision and protection.
</P>
<P>
   But Carla doesn't like to play tennis, isn't interested in art
and is probably incapable of cultivating her mother's refined
manners. Utterly guileless and bluntly candid about her feelings,
she speaks with a loud, unguarded naivete that Elizabeth can barely
tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   While at school, she learned that people ``do it.'' And she is
pleased as punch to discuss her knowledge of human biology at the
dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for independence, Carla persuades her mother to let
her attend a Bay Area technical school and begins taking a computer
class. When this works out, Carla announces that she wants to live
on her own.
</P>
<P>
   Supported by her father, Radley (Tom Skerritt), and her sisters
Caroline (Poppy Montgomery) and Heather (Sarah Paulson), she
persuades an extremely reluctant Elizabeth to let her live in her
own apartment in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest of all for Elizabeth to accept is Carla's relationship
with Danny, a good-natured fellow student and fanatical devotee of
marching bands who shares Carla's mental incapacity.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the movie's best scenes show Carla and Danny
successfully, if precariously, making their way in the world,
learning to communicate and falling in love. As they achieve one
small victory after another, you can almost feel the movie cheering
them on.
</P>
<P>
   But each new step toward autonomy presents a new crisis. While
the movie doesn't show the daily humiliations Carla and Danny
endure, their fragile self-esteem is evidence enough of what they
have suffered. Both are inclined to fall to pieces whenever they
think they are being laughed at.
</P>
<P>
   The movie awkwardly shoehorns in other lessons in tolerance. One
of Carla's sisters is a lesbian whose lover Elizabeth refuses to
acknowledge. A nasty marital spat between Elizabeth and Radley
reveals him to be a recovering alcoholic.
</P>
<P>
   Because these additional elements of the family dynamic remain
undeveloped, they only add clutter. But for all its
disease-of-the-week television movie inclinations, ``The Other
Sister'' has a core of integrity. Beneath their spiffy wedding
outfits are characters you can believe in.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES
</P>
<P>
   ``The Other Sister'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). It has some strong language.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASHEET, Lebanon _ Images of bloodied young soldiers this week
sent Israelis into another anguishing round of outrage and mourning
over their seemingly endless war in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, three Israeli paratroopers were killed and five
wounded. They were walking to set an ambush for Hezbollah
guerrillas in south Lebanon, but guerrillas got the jump on them in
a fierce 15-minute fire fight.
</P>
<P>
   They were the first Israeli casualties this year in a
17-year-old war that has killed 897 Israelis, about 1,400 Hezbollah
fighters and more than 10,000 Lebanese civilians. The war, in which
Israel occupies a nine-mile wide swath of Lebanese territory, is
often called Israel's Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Though Israeli jets responded Thursday, killing four guerrillas,
stunned Israeli citizens were still analyzing the fatal night-time
gun battle. They noted that Hezbollah has steadily improved its
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   But, tactics offer only an abstract view of the war. For a
personal view, you have to look under the scrub brush on Lebanon's
rocky hills, where Israelis and Hezbollah fighters act out roles
cast by two very different worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Cox Newspapers interviewed two Hezbollah fighters and
two Israeli paratroopers, all of whom regularly set ambushes.
</P>
<P>
   They are emblematic of a war that pits east against west and
matches middle-aged Lebanese seeking Islamic martyrdom against
young Israelis fulfilling their rites of passage into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   About the only sentiment they hold in common is the anxiety of
waiting in ambush for days and nights at a time, eating little and
speaking in whispers.
</P>
<P>
   They all volunteered for the combat duty, but the two Hezbollah
guerrillas interviewed say they literally pray that they will die
fighting for their homeland. The Israelis, by contrast, say they
know they are just holding ground until there is a negotiated end
to the war.
</P>

   ``We are born here. We are religious and we love our land,''
says guerrilla Ahmad Sayeed, a 30-year-old house builder who leaves
his family many nights to fight in Hezbollah, the Party of God.
``We are all asking to be martyrs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sayeed and fellow fighter, Khalil Musa, 29, spoke in their
farming village of Brasheet. Israeli artillery shells often land
nearby and many guerrillas and civilians have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   With his flannel shirt and well-trimmed reddish beard, Sayeed
could pass for a middle class American contractor. Musa, with a
small black beard and steely eyes, is an electrician who wires
buildings by day and Hezbollah bombs at night.
</P>
<P>
   Musa says his ambushes have killed four Israelis. Asked if he's
ever sorry for the fallen Israelis, he shakes his head with
certainty: ``Never . . . the behavior of the Israelis makes us
carry our weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls Israeli soldiers ``cartoons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis, meanwhile, are well aware of Hezbollah's
determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the big advantage for them. For us, it's not even
worth getting wounded,'' says paratrooper Moti Rubin, 20, speaking
at an army base near his home city, Jerusalem, between stints in
Lebanon. ``In truth, I don't care about the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin has a crooked smile and curly hair that his commanding
officer repeatedly tells him to cut. He chose duty in the elite
paratroopers for the personal challenge it poses. Eventually, he'll
head to business school in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he knows the rules of the ambush.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (the guerrillas) believe they are going to heaven if they
die killing you, then you don't just wound them, you have to kill
them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When you see someone walking at night in the Lebanese mountains,
he says, you shoot him. ``It's for sure he's bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Itamar Haviv, another 20-year-old paratrooper, sees fighting as
part of a patriotic duty to protect northern Israel, just as his
own father did when he fought in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   When Haviv is done, he wants to be a tour guide. He's single
now, but hopes his children will not have to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah's Musa is not so optimistic, as he looks over his
village toward the Israeli fort on a nearby hill and discusses his
10-year-old, Issa.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will follow in my way,'' he says. ``We want to be martyrs
so, if he is killed, I am not afraid of that.''

   SOUP-KITCHENS-I (Peekskill, N.Y.) _ A stream of low-wage
workers, retirees and refugees from public-assistance are swelling
the lines at soup kitchens and food pantries across America. Some
are the welfare-to-work versions of an old phenomenon: the working
poor caught in the middle _ too well off for public assistance but
not well enough off to make it on their own. Some are immigrants
who are here legally but were cut off from food stamps under new
federal welfare laws. Some are following a path of least
resistance: rather than jump through hoops designed to tarnish the
appeal of public aid, they are turning to private charities.
Together, they are changing the face of food lines long occupied by
the addicted, the disabled, the generally down-and-out. And they
may help explain a puzzle confronting poverty analysts: Why have
the lines kept growing when unemployment is at its lowest level in
a generation and the economy has remained healthy for years? By

   Psychotherapy He Can't Refuse
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Harold Ramis, the director of ``Groundhog Day'' and
``Caddyshack,'' is a deep believer in psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lifetime interest in psychotherapy,'' said Ramis, 54,
the writer and comedian who appeared in ``Stripes'' and the
``Ghostbusters'' films. ``I know a great number of therapists. I've
relied heavily on psychotherapy during every crisis of my life.
I've done therapy with my wives, my children, my brother, my
parents. We've all been in sessions together.''
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with his commitment to psychotherapy, Ramis also has a
fascination for the Mafia. ``I'm a sucker for gangster mythology,
just like everyone else in America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So it was perhaps inevitable that Ramis would merge these
interests into a comedy, ``Analyze This,'' with an unlikely plot: A
big-time New York gangster (Robert De Niro), about to assume his
role as leader of his crime family, is stricken with anxiety and
panic attacks that worry his loyal henchmen. How does the gangster
deal with his crisis? He consults a suburban New York
psychotherapist (Billy Crystal) who has plenty of problems of his
own. The film opens March 5.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was not especially easy to lift off the ground. It
went through numerous writers and, more important, the two stars
were nervous about their roles. De Niro initially wanted his
longtime collaborator, Martin Scorsese, to make the film. When
Scorsese turned it down, De Niro and Crystal seriously considered
directing the film together, which probably would have been a
formula for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   And both stars, at least at the outset, were nervous about
acting with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob was afraid Billy would turn it into a sentimental farce, a
sitcom; he was afraid it would be too pat, too unrealistic,'' said
Ramis, ultimately the film's director and one of its writers. ``And
Billy was afraid it would turn into `Goodfellas': too violent, too
mean spirited. I came in sort of to reconcile these points of view.
I reassured Billy the film would be funny. And I told Bob this
wouldn't be a sendup of `The Godfather.' I said, `Imagine you're
watching `Goodfellas,' and Woody Allen enters.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that the two stars not only enjoyed making the
movie but overcame their initial hesitancy about working together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we all were a little intimidated about working with
De Niro,'' Ramis said. ``But I try to approach things in a Zen-like
way. I don't deal with images, I deal with people. And De Niro is
virtually image free. He's totally about work. He's not
pretentious. He's totally focused on the task and what should be
done at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramis, who lives in Chicago, said he was not especially
concerned about the new and successful Home Box Office series ``The
Sopranos,'' which includes a Mafia leader who visits a therapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll be hurt,'' Ramis said. ``You remember the
movie `Big.' It was practically the fourth movie to come out that
year where an adolescent was transformed into an adult. The others
pretty much went away.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors' Challenge
</P>
<P>
   At 25, Juliette Lewis has a reputation for sometimes startling
performances in a career that has already swerved up and down. Her
films have veered from Martin Scorsese's ``Cape Fear,'' for which
she was nominated for an Academy Award for supporting actress;
Woody Allen's ``Husband's and Wives,'' and Lasse Hallstrom's
``What's Eating Gilbert Grape,'' to mishaps like ``Kalifornia,''
``Natural Born Killers'' and ``Romeo is Bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   After a two-year hiatus _ ``I sort of eliminated the enemy from
within by doing good things for myself'' _ Ms. Lewis has returned
in her most challenging and high-profile role. She plays Carla, a
somewhat retarded young woman who wants to make a life for herself,
in the bittersweet romantic comedy ``The Other Sister.'' The film
is directed by Garry Marshall, who wrote the screenplay with Bob
Brunner.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which opens Friday, also stars Giovanni Ribisi as Ms.
Lewis' boyfriend, a character who is also struggling to forge an
independent life despite his retardation, and Diane Keaton as Ms.
Lewis' overprotective mother.
</P>
<P>
   The film is based loosely on the memories of Alexandra Rose, one
of the producers, who had a friendship with a mentally disabled
woman. In the film the two main characters are functioning and
productive people, seeking to earn their own livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, whose biggest hit as a director was ``Pretty Woman,''
said he fought hard to get Ms. Lewis the role despite concerns by
executives at Walt Disney Co., which made the film. Among other
issues, executives doubted that the actress could play a romantic
and gentle role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed someone with power and determination,'' Marshall
said. ``She's probably the most powerful young actress since Jodie
Foster came along. But I knew she wasn't a laugh riot. We talked,
and she read for the part. I asked her if she had anything against
comedy. She said, `No one ever asked me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis and Ribisi, who played the doomed medic in ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' spent time with mentally disabled children and
teen-agers at two Los Angeles schools, the McBride Special
Education Center and the Exceptional Children's Foundation, as well
as with older people who were able to live alone and work despite
their retardation.
</P>
<P>
   Ribisi said, ``What struck me was how happy they were to be
working, to have a real job, their own apartments _ the
self-respect they had.'' Some of the students at the schools became
extras on the film.
</P>
<P>
   For both actors the challenge was to play the characters
honestly. It would have been easy, and embarrassing, they said, to
overact and unwittingly make the characters targets of comic
derision.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis said it took her a while to find the right tone for
the part. She found herself imitating the expressions and
intonations of her 2-year-old niece. She listened to countless
tapes of mentally disabled people having conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to invent this character and make it truthful,''
she said. ``High functional mentally handicapped people are as
varied as the colors of the rainbow. It was so scary because it was
so easy to do poorly. Unlike any other role, this one could have
been so self-conscious, so over the top. Once I found her voice, I
depended on Garry. I was always safe in his hands, which you don't
always find with directors.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said Ms. Lewis was a bit too hard on herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gets insecure,'' he said. ``She kept asking: `Was I
honest? Was this right?' After a while she lightened up.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Ms. Keaton, an old friend, was an ally, especially
as the younger actors struggled with their roles. At one point,
before a big scene, Marshall decided to use a New Age strategy,
asking the cast to join him and hold hands. The younger actors
adored it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it thrilled Diane,'' said Marshall, laughing.
`` `Do I have to do it?' she asked. Diane was not big on holding
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said Ms. Keaton was also cast in an uncharacteristic
role for her, a wealthy suburban woman who wears designer clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised Diane good clothing; she got to wear great
outfits,'' Marshall said. ``I said. `I'll give you the clothes.'
She took the part.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   One Tough Cast
</P>
<P>
   Guy Ritchie, who a few years ago was making commercials for
British television, has been absorbed with movies since childhood
and had an idea to make one in the East End of London. With a bow
to Quentin Tarantino, the idea was simple: A group of friends
bankroll a card shark for the biggest game in town. But the game is
a setup. He loses. And the friends must pay off a vicious
underworld boss a fortune _ or else.
</P>
<P>
   The caper, ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,'' is already a
big hit in Britain and opens in some cities in the United States
next Friday. What makes the film different from similar tough-guy
movies is its humor, its energy and, equally important, Ritchie's
decision to cast some ex-convicts and underworld figures he knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to British gangster films, and the nuances of
accent and class structure, there's no way around it: you've got to
cast villains if you want bad guys,'' said Ritchie. ``Villains are,
generally speaking, good actors. They've been sharpening their
skills on policemen and judges.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie, 30, said numerous members of the supporting cast had
been in prison. ``I couldn't work with a more polite, disciplined
and hard-working group of individuals,'' said Ritchie, who has
become a hot ticket in Hollywood and has been signed by a top
agent, Robert Newman of International Creative Management.
</P>
<P>
   There were other advantages of working with the unusual
supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually on a film like ours you need security guards to stop
things from being stolen,'' Ritchie said. ``We had none. There was
no thievery on the set. Everyone backed off once they knew who was
in the cast.''

 &HT;    Chimes, gongs stir symphony for the soul
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Saturday, Feb.27.
 &HT;    By Lee May

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The sound garden is growing by bongs and chimes.
</P>
<P>
   When I first started planting in Atlanta 10 years ago, I put in
bamboo and ornamental grasses to add whispers and rustles to my
space _ a space already alive with the rat-a-tat-tat of acorns from
the pre-Civil War oak next door, the sighs and crackle of falling
leaves brushing stone and branch.
</P>
<P>
   The more, the mellower; a gardener benefits from sounds as
surely as from sights, smells and touches. Happily, the dancing
leaves of grass and the swaying bamboo canes entertained and
intrigued from the first, their sounds rising and falling with the
wind's intensity. Thin and reedy in soft breezes. Heavier, thicker
in strong gusts.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, I added a brass disk, hanging it on the
brick wall out back. The plate, about 18 inches wide, was
discovered when we had to pare down the household of Lyn's mother
and move her to a care home; Alzheimer's had gotten her.
</P>
<P>
   That disk remains as mysterious as its markings, as mysterious
as the disease that has robbed her and us of her memories. We
believe the once-shiny plate came from one of the many countries
Lyn's mother visited, but which one? When she visits us, she
listens as the plate catches a light breeze and gongs, softly,
listens in high winds as it gongs and bongs harder, longer, more
persistently. Maybe those sounds almost recall once-vivid
experiences . . . someplace.
</P>
<P>
   The disk, the bamboo and the grasses got company a few years ago
when I brought back from Savannah (Ga.) several bamboo chimes and
hung them on the porches _ front, side and back. Made from five
sections of various lengths, 10 to 15 inches long, the chimes twack
and thock in the winds, bringing to the garden that evocative sound
so reminiscent of the primeval clacking of canes in bamboo forests.
I love it.
</P>
<P>
   Lately I've been worrying about myself. Just as I recognized
obsession in my planting when my car no longer could pass a nursery
without wheeling in, I now fear I cannot resist anything that
brings sound to the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Others apparently recognize it, too. Our daughter and son-in-law
in Massachusetts gave us a bell for Christmas; it hangs high in the
saucer magnolia. It's a beautiful bell _ about 8 inches tall,
wearing a blue-green patina and a copper sail that catches breezes
and pulls the attached striker that makes the amazingly big sound
that recalls much bigger bells from little towns in exotic places.
</P>
<P>
   So many sounds in such a small space might be enough for the
unobsessed. But not for me. Recently I bought a metal chime. Like
the bamboo, it has five tubes of varying lengths. Its coppery sheen
caught my eye, as it now catches the sun's afternoon rays from its
porch perch.
</P>
<P>
   This newest chime plays a five-note pattern ``made famous by
blues artists in the 1920s,'' says its tag. ``The boogie-woogie
style.'' Well.
</P>
<P>
   Now when the wind picks up, I hear a symphony. A boogie-woogie
symphony? Out front the wind whistles through leaves of bamboo and
grass while metal and bamboo chimes chime in, providing pansies
some music to dance by. Out back, the plate and bell and the bamboo
chime play percussion for blowing reeds.
</P>
<P>
   The sounds are soothing as long as the breezes don't kick too
high. But with March winds on the way and my obsession at full
tilt, that symphony could segue into cacophony.

 &HT;    Vulcan, the colossal iron statue that stands as the symbol of
Birmingham, stands in need of colossal repairs
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 28.
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM _ From the ground, he still looks like a Roman god.
Vulcan, billed as the world's largest cast-iron statue, ripples
with bronzed metallic muscles as he looms atop Red Mountain with
his anvil and hammer, overlooking the city whose steelmaking
heritage he embodies.
</P>
<P>
   But if you climb his 123-foot pedestal and stand in the pigeon
poop around his sandaled feet, it's obvious that the man of iron
isn't in peak condition these days. His ankles are rusting. Lime
leaches down his calves. Water drips embarrassingly from his
crotch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vulcan is like a lot of people you meet in bars: better
looking from a distance,'' says Guy ``Beaner'' Patton, who co-hosts
the ``Beaner and Ken'' morning radio show on WRAX-FM.
</P>
<P>
   Patton had occasion to take an up-close look recently, because
Vulcan is in the news again. An engineer has warned that the statue
is deteriorating. Such warnings are nothing new; reports of the big
fellow's decay date back at least a decade. But this time there's
something more alarming: Vulcan, the very symbol of Birmingham, is
threatening to become a public safety hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Davis, a structural engineer hired by the city to inspect
the statue, found cracks in its iron skin. He says that chunks of
metal as heavy as 250 pounds could fall, endangering the 110,000
people a year who visit the park and observation deck. At first,
Davis thought the cracks were narrow enough that he could place
ultrasound sensors to measure whether they were widening. But the
gaps were already too large, the damage too advanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could slip my ruler in some of the openings,'' says Davis,
who used to inspect nuclear power plants. ``The worst part is just
above his butt, where the apron covers his hips.''
</P>
<P>
   At 95, Vulcan isn't just some stiff-backed geezer showing his
age. He's a beloved civic mascot who's been around almost as long
as the city itself.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham was barely three decades old when it commissioned the
statue, to promote its burgeoning steel industry at the 1904
Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis. Since then, the city
has been transformed; the blast furnaces that once blackened its
sky have closed, and medicine has replaced metals as its defining
trade. Yet Birmingham remains emotionally attached to its old
identity as ``the Pittsburgh of the South,'' with Vulcan, the god
of iron and fire, as its monument.
</P>
<P>
   The Birmingham telephone book lists 46 businesses with
``Vulcan'' in the name. Generations have taken dates to the park,
with some couples getting married there. Preachers sit on benches
writing sermons under the pagan deity. Motorists know that the
torch in Vulcan's right hand _ everyone says it looks like a
push-up Popsicle _ burns green unless someone has died in a traffic
accident. Then the police flip a switch and the light turns red, as
if Vulcan himself were mourning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daddy was a trucker, and it always pleased him to see that
the light was red when he left on one of his runs. He figured the
odds were with him then,'' remembers Atlanta writer Paul Hemphill,
who grew up in Vulcan's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham has even managed to work up a fondness for the iron
man's most curious feature: his bottom. Sculptor Giuseppe Moretti
boldly left the buttocks bare on his 56-foot-tall creation. Today,
one of the most popular souvenirs at the gift shop is a T-shirt
praising Vulcan's ``Buns of Iron.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the popular affection for Vulcan, the city, which owns
the statue, has no immediate plans to overhaul it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any money earmarked for major repairs,'' Mayor
Richard Arrington announced after the cracks were discovered. He
promised that the city would patch the statue and make it safe for
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The job could have been finished by now. In 1994, a citizens'
task force led by the director of the Birmingham Historical Society
recommended a full reconditioning, like the one given the Statue of
Liberty in the 1980s. Vulcan would have been dismantled, recast
where needed and reassembled around a new steel skeleton. The cost
was estimated at $8 million, most of which the task force offered
to raise in private funds.
</P>
<P>
   But the city administration, busy with preparations for
Birmingham's bit part in the 1996 Olympic Games, didn't follow up
on the proposition. After the Games, the city placed its hopes for
repairing Vulcan on a bond referendum that went before voters last
year. It failed because the centerpiece, a new football stadium,
proved unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   So now the city is back at square one. While it weighs its
options, Davis, the engineering consultant, has placed audio
sensors on the statue to detect any movement in the cracks. If the
sensors pick up anything, an alarm sounds and the site is supposed
to be cleared.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't good enough for Vulcan's many fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are outraged that they're putting sensors on it so they
can listen while it falls apart,'' says Marjorie White, director of
the historical society. ``We need to take him down and repair him
properly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must do something,'' The Birmingham News editorialized,
``and soon, before a big chunk of Birmingham's heritage and pride
comes crashing down Red Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses are offering to help. People are sending money to the
Chamber of Commerce. Television and radio stations are planning
fund-raisers, such as the save-Vulcan concert that WRAX wants to
stage at the statue. The only thing missing is a plan from Vulcan's
landlord, the city.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time he's needed help.
</P>
<P>
   After the statue returned from the fair in 1904, Birmingham
planned to erect it in a park but decided not to when neighbors
protested that its nekkid bum would offend the ladies. The statue
sat in pieces in a rail yard for two years. Then it was reassembled
(with its right hand put on backwards) at the state fairgrounds,
where it remained for the better part of 30 years. It was often
used as an advertising medium. Instead of a spear, Vulcan at times
held a giant ice cream cone or a Coca-Cola bottle; once he donned a
very large pair of Liberty overalls.
</P>
<P>
   Vulcan wasn't rescued from commercial indignities until 1936,
when the Works Progress Administration started building him a new
home atop Red Mountain, a ridge named for its vein of iron ore. In
his moment of glory, though, the seeds of his present dilemma were
sown.
</P>
<P>
   To stabilize the statue in high winds, workers filled Vulcan up
to his armpits with tons of concrete. The problem is that concrete
expands much faster than iron, meaning that the statue's innards
have been pressing against its skin for decades, cracking the
1-to-2-inch metal plating. To make matters worse, Vulcan has a big
hole in his head. It allows maintenance workers access to the
statue but also lets rainwater seep into the concrete, further
eroding the structure's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Crick has disappeared into that hole on many occasions.
Several times a month, the wiry sign company owner climbs the rungs
sunk into Vulcan's chest and inches out onto the arm to change some
of the 32 lights in the torch. He first noticed the cracks in
Vulcan's hip about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're getting worse,'' Crick says, as he puts on his
harness to brave another climb. ``We better take him down and fix
him before he kills somebody.''

 &HT;    Day after day, a Douglasville, Ga. woman crochets afghans that
provide warmth and comfort to AIDS or hospice patients
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Saturday, Feb. 27.
 &HT;    By Derrick Henry

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ellie Handsel is a woman on a mission. She sits alone,
focused on her work, quietly crocheting. Nine hours after
beginning, Handsel is finished, a beautiful lap robe complete,
ready to be sent off to a terminally ill patient or a person living
with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The next day she will start again. Nine hours of effort. Another
blanket. It's a daily routine she's followed for 10 years, creating
more than 3,500 lap robes.
</P>
<P>
   The blankets, typically placed over the lap and knees for
warmth, are given to clients of Project Open Hand, a meal delivery
service for people with AIDS, and to patients at various Atlanta
area hospices.
</P>
<P>
   Each blanket carries with it a brief note: ``This was made
especially for you with love, hope and care. Sincerely, Ellie.''
</P>
<P>
   The gesture is simple. The impact is huge. Recipients have been
buried with their blankets. Others have become cherished family
heirlooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many people, it's the last gift and last note they will
ever receive,'' says Handsel, 61.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, a network of volunteers from across the country has
taken up Handsel's mission, providing nearly 1,000 lap robes a
year. The nonprofit enterprise has become known as ``Smoking
Needle,'' a nickname Handsel earned years ago for her quick
needlework.
</P>
<P>
   The 300-plus volunteers, called Ellie's Angels, work at their
own pace _ some take six months to do what Handsel does each day _
and range in age from 7-year-old Scouts to senior citizens in their
90s. Most out-of-state volunteers send their blankets to Atlanta;
some give them away close to home. And Handsel occasionally sends
blankets to organizations across the country that request them.
</P>
<P>
   One Atlanta volunteer, the late Elizabeth Copeland, understood
the power of the robes. ``Ellie's blankets are the hugs some of
these people never got,'' Copeland was fond of saying.
</P>
<P>
   Tommie Phillips received such a gift six years ago, five years
after he was diagnosed with AIDS, three years after he was told he
would be dead. ``It's my prize possession,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, 39, also cherishes the lap robe of his longtime
partner, John Maben, who died last September. ``It's like having
him around,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta resident, now a volunteer with Project Open Hand,
delivers blankets Handsel has made for new clients. ``I've seen
grown men and women, rich and poor, break down and cry over them,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Handsel traces her desire to help the terminally ill to her
childhood in North Carolina, where she spent seven years in a
boarding school outside of Asheville. ``That's how I learned the
compassion that comes from loneliness,'' she says. ``And death is
the loneliest trip we will ever make.''
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Hammett, an epidemiologist with the Division of HIV/AIDS
Prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
became a volunteer with Handsel to put a face to the numbers she
compiled on the AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these (recipients) had been rejected by their families
and felt very alone,'' says Hammett. ``You should have seen their
faces, the tears in their eyes, when they found out someone who was
not even part of the family would take the time to knit a blanket
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Castor, 44, of Missoula, Mont., has knitted more than 100
blankets for Handsel. ``Just the satisfaction of helping someone
else is why I do it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Rolen, 43, a chaplain with SunAlliance Hospice in Dunwoody
(Ga.), calls Handsel's work a ``true random act of kindness.''
Rolen, who has delivered her lap robes to many patients, says,
``They add a lot of warmth to some pretty austere settings.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Handsel's life is pretty austere as well. Twice
divorced, she lives in a room in a friend's house in Douglasville
(Ga.). Her only source of income is the occasional signature afghan
and baby blanket she sells. Friends help to supply her food and
yarn.
</P>
<P>
   A painfully self-conscious woman, she spends most of the day
crocheting while listening to music (big-band jazz is a favorite),
watching television (especially PBS dramas) and talking on the
phone with her volunteers _ most of whom she has never met.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a recluse, but I am crazy about people,'' she says, then
jokingly adds, ``The only thing I can't do while I crochet is
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for Smoking Needle came in 1989 when her life was at
a crossroads. After a series of short-lived professional ventures _
from troubleshooting for a developer to operating a Atlanta art
gallery _ Handsel received an invitation from an interior designer
to make an afghan for the living room of Jerusalem House, a
residence in Atlanta for people with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went over to deliver it and found a patient who was
unconscious,'' Handsel says. ``I held his hands and talked to him.
His hands were freezing. They told me he had no friends and no
relatives. So I thought, why don't I make everyone here a lap robe?
And that's what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Handsel had found her mission, her reason for being.
</P>
<P>
   She begins crocheting shortly after waking each day and often
works late into the night. She refuses to take even a day off. If
she were offered a vacation, her needles would have to come along,
she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her singleness of purpose can be overbearing,'' says good
friend Richard Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   But such zeal does not go unnoticed or unappreciated. ``She's
just a good, good woman,'' says Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Handsel remains steadfast, focused, always thinking about the
next lap robe to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never stop,'' she says. ``This is my mission, this is
what I am convinced God put me on Earth to do, and I love it.''

 &HT;    Garden centers to tag plants according to tolerance for a
region's high-temperature extremes
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Saturday, Feb. 27.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some plants _ like some gardeners _ can't take the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, some nurseries still sell them, and some gardeners still
buy them. Call it greed, call it ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   That's about to change. Growers have begun using a new tool
aimed at helping consumers determine which plants can tolerate an
area's high temperatures. The plant heat-zone map, developed by the
American Horticultural Society, charts 12 color-coded regions of
the United States according to the annual average number of days an
area experiences ``heat days'' _ extremes during which temperatures
reach 86 degrees or higher and plants begin to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale nurseries gradually are adopting the map, developed
about a year ago, to indicate heat zones on tags of more than
20,000 different types of annuals, perennials and woody plants that
they sell to garden centers. That means that beginning this spring,
shoppers will be able to tell whether a plant is suitable for their
garden. A tag in a potted daisy identified as ``Z-8'' means that
plant should thrive in Zone 8, metro Atlanta, where the city
experiences heat days an average 90 to 120 days per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A garden happens when the right plants are in the right
place,'' said Marc Cathey, a horticultural scientist who spent 14
years developing the map. ``We're always asking ourselves if a
flower or plant will make it in our gardens.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathey, the horticultural society's president emeritus, has
spent the past year traveling the country to raise awareness about
heat-zone gardening, and last week he had a captive audience at
Atlanta's Southeastern Flower Show.
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep asking us, `Why didn't you do this years ago?' ''
he said. ``How many times have you bought a plant at a garden
center and said to yourself later, `Didn't they know you can't grow
that here?' Of course they knew.''
</P>
<P>
   The map, which Cathey helped develop using daily highs recorded
at nearly 5,000 U.S. weather stations between 1974 and 1995, is an
important breakthrough, given global warming worries. It's also
been hailed as the overdue equivalent of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Hardi-
</P>
<P>
   ness Zone Map, long used by growers to indicate a plant's
tolerance for cold.
</P>
<P>
   The horticultural society's goal is to get growers to indicate
both heat zones as well as hardiness zones in their catalog
listings and on their plant tags. So far, six catalogs carry the
desig-
</P>
<P>
   nations, and two California-based growers _ Monrovia and Paul
Ecke Ranch _ are marking their labels accordingly. In addition,
about a dozen gardening books and plant guides now list heat zones
with their plant descriptions. The latest resource is the
pocket-size AHS Great Plant Guide Featuring Over 2,000 Plants (DK
Publishing, $16.95), released this week.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 zones range from seven months of heat days at the
southernmost tip of Florida to no heat days at elevations such as
Grandfather Mountain in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The designations are given in ranges _ ``Z 6-8'' for cold
hardiness zones, for example, and ``8-6'' for heat tolerance zones.
(The cold range is always given in increasing numbers; the heat one
in decreasing order.)
</P>
<P>
   Cathey expects that with Monrovia, one of the nation's largest
wholesalers, leading the way, most growers will follow suit and
that by next year heat-zone-tagged plants will be common.
</P>
<P>
   For plant retailers, that won't be a day too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heat has always been a troubling question _ something people
always wonder about,'' said Rick Berry, co-owner of Goodness Grows
nursery in Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the information began to surface more than 15 years
ago, he said, as more consumers began to experi-
</P>
<P>
   ment in their gardens with perennials.
</P>
<P>
   Cathey also hopes the map will encourage gardeners to experiment
with underused plants rather than relying on old standards simply
``because they can take the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of the same old humdrum, the ironclad choices, in
everyone's yard,'' Cathey said. ``There's nothing wrong with
junipers, but why not try something else occa-
</P>
<P>
   sionally?''
</P>
<P>
   For Martha Wills, who has watched her share of misplaced plants
wither in her yard, the coding can't happen soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in Macon, and the heat there is just terrible for our
yards,'' she said after hearing Cathey's presentation. ``I think
it's going to be the best thing since sliced bread.''

 &HT;    Singer Michael English returns to the 'Gospel' road
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Saturday, Feb. 27.
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Michael English wants to be known as more than the
Christian singer who sinned.
</P>
<P>
   His singing career peaked and crashed during a two-day period
five years ago. After winning six Dove Awards _ the Christian music
industry's equivalent of the Grammy _ he admitted to having an
affair with another Christian singer.
</P>
<P>
   He returned the awards. His marriage ended. He quit performing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologize every night for what I've done,'' English now
says. ``My heart is just broken for the people who believed in me
and supported me.''
</P>
<P>
   But English never lost his love for gospel music. He began
performing gospel again about two years ago and will be in concert
in Atlanta at 7 p.m. Sunday at the First Baptist Church in Avondale
Estates.
</P>
<P>
   The concert is part of English's attempt to carve out a new
identity that's not linked with his infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait until the day when the headline will just read,
`Michael English in concert,''' he said. ``It's always something
like, `Singer, fallen from grace.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who want me to stay out of it, but that's not
what I'm going to do,'' English said. ``It's hard to forgive and
forget. They don't want to. That's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, including several pastors and Christian musicians, have
offered encouragement. And recently the Christian music industry
seems to have softened its stand toward English.
</P>
<P>
   CCM Magazine, which covers contemporary Christian music, raved
about his latest album, ``Gospel,'' noting that his voice now has
``a rich, melancholy timbre'' and ``plaintive urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   English has also been invited to sing with the Gaither Vocal
Band and on the Trinity Broadcasting Network.
</P>
<P>
   Such acceptance is comforting, but English still sounded
melancholy at times during a recent phone conversation. He said his
``self-esteem was shot'' after his divorce and he's still adjusting
to being the single parent of a 14-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   But his mood brightens when he talks about performing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a part of my soul, of my life. I ran from God after
all this happened and I did things I'm not proud of,'' English
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But God was telling me you've run long enough. It's time to
get back to where you started.''
</P>

SUCCESS COMES SLOWLY FOR SINGER-SONGWRITER
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When singer-songwriter Tommy Henriksen moved to
Los Angeles, he found himself broke and at loose ends. At one
point, he had friends back in Long Island mail him their used
clothing so he could sell it at garage sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked at Kinko's, roadied for Alice Cooper _ the only thing
I didn't do was wait tables,'' Henriksen recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Now the San Fernando Valley resident is waiting to see what will
happen with his just-released, self-titled debut album on Capitol.
The disc, which is sometimes reminiscent of Seal's work, features a
mix of rock, pop and international influences and includes a cameo
from Nina Hagen and samples of chanting Tibetan monks.
</P>
<P>
   Henriksen may be a new name to many, but he's certainly paid his
dues. In five years of trying, he played in a series of local bands
specializing in every type of music, from metal to pop to
classic-rock, while gigging at local clubs from the Viper Room to
FM Station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took all those years to get signed,'' he said. ``I just
knew this was the first time I actually had something I really felt
good about musically.''
</P>
<P>
   Henriksen's intriguing debut, which includes the track ``I See
the Sun'' from the ``Blast From the Past'' soundtrack, was
co-produced and engineered by Keith Forsey, known for his work with
Psychedelic Furs, Simple Minds and Billy Idol.
</P>
<P>
   ``My demos actually sound like the record,'' Henriksen, 30,
offered. ``That's unusual because when you get with a producer,
they have their own ideas and you have your ideas, and then things
change. But Keith and I were on the same path.''
</P>
<P>
   The album's vocals and guitar overdubs were cut on Henriksen's
12-track Akai tape recorder, and the basic tracks were completed at
Forsey's home.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from multi-instrumentalist Henriksen, the primary musician
on the record was Northridge-based keyboardist Jamie Muhoberac, who
played on Seal's albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to incorporate a lot of instruments not usually heard
in pop and rock music, like the sitar, tabla drums, the moon lute,
the Irish pennywhistle, the banjo, accordion and the Swedish
bagpipe,'' Henriksen said. ``I listen to a lot of world music
myself, and I want to encourage other people to know about the
different cultures and sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the use of a variety of global instruments, Henriksen
actually grew up in the blue-collar hamlet of Port Jefferson
Station, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like living in the Midwest except people go, `Yo,
wassup?''' Henriksen says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Henriksen believes that despite recent mergers within the music
industry, there's still room for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some musicians could be envious because you might be doing
better than they are,'' he said. ``But I always believed the music
industry is big enough. Just move over and let me have my shot.'' &QL;

FANS PENS BIO OF KEITH MOON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients   )  
By FRED SHUSTER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Tony Fletcher was 14, he attended an exhibit
of Who memorabilia curated by the group's fans.
</P>
<P>
   While studying a life-size hologram of the band's Keith Moon at
the drums, the boy turned to find the real thing standing next to
him. Pulling from his bag a copy of the fanzine he produced for his
schoolmates, Fletcher asked Moon to autograph it.
</P>
<P>
   After a short conversation with the teen, Moon gave Fletcher his
address and said to drop by sometime. A week or so later, Fletcher
went to the posh London apartment, but there was no answer.
</P>
<P>
   Just a couple of weeks later, Moon was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher tells that story as an epilogue in ``Moon: The Life and
Death of a Rock Legend'' (Spike Books; $30), his wonderful
biography of the manic, full-throttle hedonist and drummer whose
life was a nonstop out-of-control party.
</P>
<P>
   Music journalist Fletcher spent more than three years
researching Moon's life and interviewed dozens of the flamboyant
musician's friends, colleagues and associates. As for the surviving
members of the Who, only bassist John Entwistle participated; Pete
Townshend explained he no longer had anything good to say about his
former drummer, and Roger Daltrey felt the biography would conflict
with a proposed film project.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it's hard to imagine that this highly readable
unvarnished 600-page life story could be much more complete.
</P>
<P>
   Moon lived in Los Angeles for several years and even bought a
ramshackle house on Knobhill Drive in Sherman Oaks for less than
$50,000 in the mid-'70s. Of course, the TV ended up in the pool
right off the bat, and the slowly simmering neighbors eventually
exacted their revenge with a foghorn at dawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moon'' is full of hilarious stories but never ignores the fact
that Moon's energetic drumming is what made the Who so distinctive.
Fletcher does a good job making this musical trailblazing easily
understandable even to nonmusicians.
</P>
<P>
   The author, who previously penned books on R.E.M. and '80s band
Echo and the Bunnymen, also remains fixed on the troubled man at
the center of the maelstrom.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame ``Moon'' has to end so sadly. But at the very least
you'll want to blast your Who albums. At most, you'll wreck a hotel
room in Moon's honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, Keith Moon had been more than just a world-famous rock
star, more than simply a brilliant drummer, more even than the most
irrepressible and carefree character of rock 'n' roll's last 15
years,'' Fletcher sums up. ``He had been a human being, an
approachable, affable man who had never forgotten what it was like
to be a fan or a dreamer. More than that, for those few minutes
that August (at the exhibit), he had been as a friend.'' &QL;

 KISS AND MAKE UP?
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Successful political leaders can never have friends
and never have enemies. They can only have interests.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that eternal truth is being ignored as President Clinton and
Republican congressional leaders struggle to pick up where they
left off in the business of governing before the ridiculous
impeachment show. They are so hung up on their distrust of each
other that it is difficult for them even to speak with civility.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that the confrontation was so hideously personal
it will require exceptional diplomatic tact to overcome the deep
animosities ground into our national being. But we did not elect
these bozos to indulge their innermost emotions. We elected them to
run the country. And if they can't remember that, we ought to
replace them.
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional leaders emerged in a sulky mood this
week from their chilly first post-impeachment meeting with the
president. Insider accounts indicate the session was unpleasant.
Afterward, the GOP spokesmen stubbornly refused to answer repeated
questions from reporters asking whether they trusted the president.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott had already declared in the
wake of Clinton's acquittal on charges of perjury and obstruction
of justice that he could no longer trust the president's word.
Actually, there is no evidence that he ever did trust Clinton since
Republicans have a long list of complaints about being misled in
past policy negotiations with the president.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, who unlike Lott has no past
experience of working directly with the president, said merely that
the meeting was a ``good first start.'' But Hastert's press
spokesman noted that the parties still needed to ``deal with the
trust deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton didn't display acres of trusting affection
toward the other side either. He implied the GOP leaders are
political cowards. Patronizingly, he observed they probably ducked
the questions because ``any answer they give makes it more
difficult for them, potentially at least, within their caucus or
within the country ...''
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats and Republicans are having their own problems
with the impeachment hangover. Party leaders have scheduled a
retreat in March that is supposed to encourage members to become
bipartisan buddies. But many on both sides are scornfully resisting
attending it, and the affair is shaping up as a public relations
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   It is too much to expect that trust between the two sides _ that
is, total confidence in each other's word _ will suddenly blossom
in the Capitol corridors. The Republicans tried to take away the
president's job. That's not something one forgets. The president
made the GOP look mean-spirited and foolish. That's not easily
forgotten either.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally the political climate would improve if more Democrats
and Republicans actually liked each other. But it is not essential,
and neither is trust. The real test is whether they can
pragmatically put aside their personal feelings to work together in
their mutual self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Both the president and the GOP congressional leaders suggest
they understand this imperative, but they sound as though they are
mouthing what they think they ought to say, not what they really
mean to do. If they had boldly repeated Ronald Reagan's immortal
philosophy of how to conduct arms negotiations with the Soviet
Union _ ``trust but verify'' _ we might be getting somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It is clearly in the political interest of Republicans, burdened
with public disapproval over their handling of the impeachment
charade, to demonstrate that as the congressional majority they can
govern. It is just as clearly in Clinton's interest to demonstrate
that he is not a useless lame duck so burdened with scandal that
his party does not deserve to win elections in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP has only 11 more votes in the House than the Democrats,
a margin so narrow that unless the majority miraculously congeals
into a solid bloc, it cannot deliver anything without Democratic
help. The GOP has a similar margin of 10 votes in the Senate, too
slim to prevent a Democratic filibuster of any overtly partisan
legislation. The president is not always in step with his
congressional party, but the two are more in tune in
post-impeachment days than they have been in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative to bipartisan teamwork here is chaos. It is time
for strange bedfellows to plop themselves down on the mattress.
</P>
<P>
   History is replete with stories of politicians who distrust each
other overcoming their suspicions to accomplish what they both need
and want. And history applauds the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   A classic example is that of President Johnson and Robert F.
Kennedy, who despised each other. In 1964 the then-popular Johnson
campaigned for Kennedy in his New York Senate race despite their
barely-concealed mutual dislike. By embracing Johnson, Kennedy was
able to rescue a seat he had seemed about to lose. And by embracing
Kennedy, Johnson got an additional Democratic vote in the Senate
and temporarily muted the Kennedy family's resentment of him.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial question is whether a majority on both sides is able
to focus on the ultimate prize rather than the other guy's kickable
shins. That is not a matter of trust or of the heart. It is a
matter of a hard political head.

   The game: to go out with 20 different women, film the dates by
any means necessary and fall in love with one of them before the
stunt is over. ``This is a documentary,'' Berkowitz keeps
insisting. ``This is real.''
</P>
<P>
   So off he goes to make dupes of new acquaintances and embarrass
as many of them as possible. What seems to make this a funny idea,
at least by Berkowitz's thinking, is that he's also so eager to
embarrass himself.
</P>
<P>
   He becomes the sole true focus of any scene, whether he's bungee
jumping or cruising for girlfriends in a supermarket. And he
chooses to hog the limelight even when revealing that cheese makes
him constipated or other such news.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're saying this is about single women in Los Angeles when
really, Myles, this is all about you,'' a woman tells him. And
she's just Date No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   It must be said that Berkowitz's shamelessness and persistence
aren't inevitably irresistible. He can sound wryly
self-deprecating, Woody Allenish, in a way that's bound to wear
viewers down. (``Given that my ex-wife was engaged and pregnant, it
was probably over between us anyway.'')
</P>
<P>
   And he concocts a long array of gambits, from not having enough
money to cover an expensive dinner to getting himself booted out of
Spago for bringing a camera crew. He crashes a wedding. He stakes
out an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. He visits a fetish club. He
trawls wherever he can.
</P>
<P>
   But whenever ``20 Dates'' begins to establish a playful mood,
it's liable to do something to make you squirm. It's fair game for
him to include the screaming telephone voice of his crass financial
backer, who demands that Tia Carrere be in the film for supposed
marquee value.
</P>
<P>
   It's another to watch him grimace when a woman he dates doesn't
look enough like Jessica Rabbit. And there are a couple of
genuinely nasty episodes in which the candid camera turns cruel.
(Two of the 20 women have brought suit against Berkowitz, he
cavalierly explains.)
</P>
<P>
   Even when Ms. Right appears in the form of a beautiful
saleswoman named Elisabeth, she is made to squirm while Berkowitz
confronts her with the other women he's still dating. Incidentally,
his violations of privacy do not extend into spying on sexual
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``20 Dates'' prompts thoughts of Albert Brooks, who can turn
mock-verite into such a treat. It has also prompted at least one
other filmmaker to phone his lawyer. Stephen M. Manin's Cinemax
film ``Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Saskatchewan,'' which also
observes courtship on camera, shares some strong similarities with
``20 Dates.''
</P>
<P>

BARRYMORE'S OWN CINDERELLA STORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Fairy tales do come true/It can happen to you ...
</P>
<P>
   For Drew Barrymore, who first made a splash as an urchin in
Steven Spielberg's 1982 hit ``E.T.,'' it's been a long and rocky
road. While it was clear early on that she had an abundance of
talent, her bouts with drugs and alcoholism starting at the
incredibly young age of 9 took their toll on her and her career.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the scion of the famed acting family has
straightened out her life but has had few chances in high-profile
films in which to showcase her acting abilities. (She was little
more than an ornament in 1995's ``Batman Forever,'' and was
dispatched early, and in quite a grisly fashion, in the 1996
chiller ``Scream.'' She was in the wildly successful ``The Wedding
Singer.'' But let's face it, no one's really taking your acting
seriously in an Adam Sandler comedy.)
</P>
<P>
   That's why her star turn last in last summer's box-office
success ``Ever After: A Cinderella Story,'' out on video Tuesday,
was a welcome chance to see a mature Barrymore (she turns 24 this
month) in action.
</P>
<P>
   And action is a key component in ``Ever After,'' which is a
reinterpretation of the Cinderella story. The story set in the 16th
century begins when an aristocratic French lady (the regal Jeanne
Moreau) calls in the Brothers Grimm to tell them the truth about
the Cinderella story:
</P>
<P>
   A young Danielle (played by Anna Maguire) is orphan at an early
age, just after her widowed father (Jeroen Krabbe) had remarried.
She then becomes, in essence, a servant in her father's house,
taking care of her stepmother Rodmilla (Anjelica Huston) and her
stepsisters, the pretty but shrewish Marguerite (Megan Dodds) and
docile and dumpy Jacqueline (Melanie Lynskey), while they squander
the family fortune.
</P>
<P>
   She grows up (now played by Barrymore), educating herself and
becoming quite self-assured despite her lowly status. Though
victimized and suffering repeated taunts by her stepfamily, she's
hardly a victim. Danielle is a woman of action, able to wield a
sword as well as a pen.
</P>
<P>
   When Prince Charming comes along _ actually Prince Henry
(Dougray Scott) _ she rescues him from a band of rogues by slinging
him over her shoulder. When Rodmilla schemes to marry Marguerite
off to the prince, it is not a fairy godmother who comes to
Danielle's rescue. Instead, it is the man who epitomizes the
Renaissance itself, Leonardo da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey), who
outfits her in a gossamer-winged gown and exquisite slippers.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Ever After'' is no simple fairy tale. Much of the credit
should be given to director and co-screenwriter Andy Tennant, who
was smart enough to reinvent the Cinderella story with a modern
sensibility while not robbing it of its romantic essence and for
casting Barrymore, who brings these dual qualities to her
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Too often in the past, Barrymore has played tarted-up roles
(think ``Poison Ivy,'' where her character seduces her best
friend's father). In ``Ever After,'' she brings a solidness and
grace to her feisty character, a delicate balance that few young
actresses could pull off. Hopefully, this fairy tale part of her
career will continue.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the ``f word'' that earned ``Ever After'' a PG-13
rating has been deleted from the video, making it PG; it still can
be heard on the DVD, however. Nevertheless, it's excellent family
entertainment _ especially for girls, though there is plenty of
action for the boys.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who are fans of ``Doctor Who,'' the BBC is
releasing two more vintage episodes next week _ ``The Ark'' and
``Horror of Fang Rock'' _ priced at $19.95 each.

CAPTURING DIGRESSIONS OF LIFE IN INDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first of these three wonderfully observed short novels,
the uncle of 10-year old Sandeep remarks: ``When we were young, the
world was made of small islands of consciousness. Miles separated
one village, sometimes one house, from another. Letter-writing was
the only means of communication _ there were no telephones. A
mountain or a river formed the border to our world. Our world was
small, and things loomed large and astonishing for us: you wouldn't
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sandeep does understand, and so does his creator, Amit
Chaudhuri, a gifted young writer who has created an indelible
portrait of India in this volume while at the same time leaving us
with a Proustian tapestry of quotidian moments recaptured and
remade as they loom large and astonishing in his characters' minds.
</P>
<P>
   Not a whole lot happens in these novels. The first, ``A Strange
and Sublime Address,'' concerns two visits Sandeep makes as a boy
to his uncle's house in Calcutta; the second, ``Afternoon Raag,''
concerns the arrival of a young man at Oxford University and his
memories of his childhood in India; the third and most
conventionally plotted, ``Freedom Song,'' concerns the
lackadaisical life of a young man in Calcutta, his dabbling in
Communist politics and his eventual decision to marry.
</P>
<P>
   As Chaudhuri himself puts it at one point, the writer is so
``caught up in jotting down the irrelevances and digressions that
make up lives, and the life of a city, rather than a good story''
that the reader might well cry out, ``Come to the point!''
</P>
<P>
   In fact there is no point beyond the capture of those
privileged, vanished moments that have lodged in the narrator's
imagination: the glimpse, down the street, of a young neighborhood
girl ``memorizing the rules of grammar, the old man in the easy
chair fanning himself, and the house with the small, empty porch
that was crowded'' with possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   From such small, bright Polaroids of ordinary life Chaudhuri
conjures a web of relationships among family members, neighbors,
friends and acquaintances, spinning their banal squabbles, gossip
and daily routines, ``the minute frustrations and satisfactions of
their lives,'' into a subtle musical pattern. He preserves for us
the mood of a particular day: its heat, its light, its emotional
weather. He gives us the busy rhythms of a morning in Calcutta, the
langour of a summer afternoon, that surreal nighttime moment, after
a power failure when the lights are restored, like the candles on a
birthday cake magically being relit.
</P>
<P>
   Though his writing on the surface may seem casual, even artless,
there is a hidden subtlety to Chaudhuri's work. While he appears
simply to be setting down random incidents _ the family automobile
breaking down, a tiff among the servants, a luxurious Sunday
morning shave _ such elliptical scenes are animated by an
underlying tension between tradition and modernity, continuity and
change, as well as the tension between the past and its remembered,
virtual re-creation.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the reader is continually made aware in the
luminous first novel, ``A Strange and Sublime Address,'' of the
story's dual perspective. On one hand, there's the point of view of
10-year-old Sandeep, an aspiring writer mesmerized by his father's
tales of business dealings and the antics of the gods and goddesses
of his aunt's religion; on the other, there's the point of view of
the older narrator (presumably Sandeep, himself a kind of stand-in
for the author), trying to recapture his childhood through the
magic of simile and metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter two stories, a similar sense of time and flux is
created by the juxtaposition of the younger characters' lives with
those of their parents and grandparents. In ``Afternoon Raag,'' the
narrator's unhappy, desultory affairs with two women at Oxford are
thrown into relief by his portrait of his parents' long, enduring
marriage. In ``Freedom Song,'' set in 1993, a Calcutta family's
fortunes _ its losses, triumphs, misfortunes and anxieties _ are
chronicled against the backdrop of rising tensions between Hindus
and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Change is the dominant melody running through these novels.
There are the momentous changes older characters remember, like the
partition of India and the splitting of the provinces of Bengal and
the Punjab; and there are the smaller, domestic changes that ripple
through all their lives, disrupting their weekday rituals and
jarring their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Deaths, marriages, births, the loss of a job or the acquisition
of a new car, all are woven effortlessly by Chaudhuri into a
seamless piece of music, not one of those ``straight, angular''
compositions of the West, carefully rendered like ``print upon a
page,'' but something closer to the curving lines from an Indian
raag that read like ``longhand writing drawn upon the air.''

MAKING A COMEBACK, THAT MAN FROM MARS 
</HEADLINE>

 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MY FAVORITE MARTIAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels, Elizabeth Hurley, Daryl Hannah,
Wallace Shawn &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Donald Petrie &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG 88 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On day No. 85 of a Mars probe, the camera aboard a mini-golf
cart peters out one boulder short of revealing a big, jumping city.
Yes, there is life on the red planet, though still unbeknownst to
everybody on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Back in California, a space shuttle blasts off with the remains
of Jerry Garcia. Headed our way is an unidentified flying object.
``Scramble the F-16's!'' cries a dispatcher in Petrie's moderately
diverting update of the 60s CBS sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   The incoming craft buries itself in a deserted stretch of beach.
The only witness is a dumbfounded television reporter named O'Hara
(Daniels), who fails to notice that a three-eyed Martian has
circled behind him and hopped in the trunk of his car.
</P>
<P>
   At O'Hara's place, the Martian transforms into the human Uncle
Martin (Lloyd), an enthusiastic and rather urbane fellow of about
60 with a great build for a man his age and a wildly excited
expression that reminds one of Lloyd's Doc Brown in the ``Back to
the Future'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   At certain junctures, however, Martin reverts to his Martian
appearance, which is both upsetting and thrilling to O'Hara.
</P>
<P>
   Very gradually the two get to know each other. But there's
trouble. The government is on to Martin the Martian and so is Brace
Channing (Ms. Hurley), a dim but manically ambitious rival of
O'Hara's. And if Martin doesn't get his space ship fixed, it will
self-destruct and strand him forever.
</P>
<P>
   When Martians get depressed, they fall apart physically,
trailing red body parts like leavings from a lobster dinner. Here's
hoping that the alternator Martin appropriates from O'Hara's car
gets him back up and planet-hopping. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE The government's main man ( Shawn) threatens to spray
gunfire and there is other rough stuff, but it is mild and comic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Nothing happens, but Brace Channing turns up the innuendo to
hot and heavy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY None. &QL; 
For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-5 They're awfully young, but there's nothing too untoward
and many children will get enough of the gist to follow along. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-10 Bull's-eye. Up and down this age range, all will enjoy
themselves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11 AND UP About now that old spoilsport called
sophistication will be nagging many viewers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BLAST FROM THE PAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Fraser, Alicia Silverstone, Christopher Walken, Sissy
Spacek &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Hugh Wilson &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 105 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, John F. Kennedy's speech regarding Soviet missiles in
Cuba sends Calvin Webber (Walken), a very mad scientist, and his
wife, Helen (Ms. Spacek), pregnant and hugging a warm pot roast,
diving for the elaborate fallout shelter Calvin has prepared for
just such an occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the steel doors have closed over them, a plane
accidentally crashes into their house. Hearing an explosion above
them, Calvin is convinced of the worst: to survive the radiation,
they must remain entombed for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   It could be worse. Little Adam (who grows up to be Fraser) is a
healthy, obedient child fed a steady diet of his parents' 50s
gee-whiz pluck and amiability. The shelter looks much like home and
is equipped like a small town.
</P>
<P>
   While Helen turns to drink and retires for private screaming
sessions, she carries on nobly. Calvin stays Calvin, puttering with
shelter mechanical systems and imbuing true-blue values in his son.
</P>
<P>
   And then comes liberation. Outside lies a world that to them is
as alarming as if they popped out into a civilization of atomic
mutants. Their immaculate backyard is now an adult book store in a
blasted-out part of town whose crazed inhabitants immediately start
a cult at the sight of Calvin in a gas mask.
</P>
<P>
   By now Adam is a handsome, excruciatingly pleasant young man.
Not unreasonably, he wants a girl and soon encounters Eve (Ms.
Silverstone), a cynical but decent young woman ever on the rebound
from her latest rotten relationship.
</P>
<P>
   At first the riotously out-of-date Adam puzzles Eve and
everybody else with his thunderstruck reactions to his surroundings
and outlandish explanations of his origins. Can she come to terms
with a man from a hole in the ground? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Dad taught Adam to use his fists (a 50s skill), and he
does so briefly to discourage an abusive former boyfriend of
Eve's. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None is performed, but there is a lot of talk about sex. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Quite a bit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-9 Not for them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-12 This is a catchy story with appealing characters and,
on balance, nothing very harmful. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP This is a film for teen-agers. &QL;

<P>
   PG 100 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the straight-shooting 50s, Sputnik flashes across the sky
above a West Virginia coal mining town and a high school boy named
Homer Hickham determines to build a rocket of his own, only smaller
and more along the lines of something you'd present at a science
fair.
</P>
<P>
   Homer is a glowingly earnest lad, but his plan puts off his
stern father ( Cooper), a hidebound mine foreman who feels the boy
belongs down a shaft with his nose to the coal seam.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Homer has a supportive science teacher (Ms. Dern),
cooperative school friends and some sympathetic experts on metals
and welding at the mine to help him build an increasingly advanced
series of baby rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody is impressed except, of course, Homer's dad.
Eventually, though, the man (who is the film's most interesting
character) gives resigned approval.
</P>
<P>
   From there it's on to the science fair circuit, where Homer wins
prizes, presses the flesh with the rocket scientist Werner Von
Braun, and readies for a career in the NASA space program. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Men are carried off after mine mishaps, but nothing is
graphic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE It may sound a little too feel-good, but the film is
based on a true story, and there are clips from home movies of the
real-life characters to prove it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-5 Like the rockets, the story will pass over the heads of
most little ones. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-10 This is a good age. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11 AND UP Set in a simpler era, the movie is unfortunately
quite a bit too simple for most older children. &QL;

`CHAIM'S LOVE STORY' AN OFF-BROADWAY SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Last August, the night before the reviews came
out, David Cox couldn't sleep. He and his partner, Edmund Gaynes,
had learned that The New York Times wanted a photo of their
off-Broadway show, ``Chaim's Love Song'' to run with a critique in
the next day's editions.
</P>
<P>
   That probably meant one of two things: Either the veteran San
Fernando Valley producers had a bona fide hit on their hands, or
they'd be packing their bags and heading home in about a New York
minute.
</P>
<P>
   So when Cox raced out to buy a paper the next morning and saw
the large photo alongside a glowing review in The Times, he says,
``I started jumping up and down on Second Avenue. I said, `I can't
read it, I'm too excited!' I was just beyond myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In her review, critic Anita Gates described the play as a
``rich, affecting drama'' that ``balances wit and grave wisdom
gracefully,'' producing ``a funny, philosophical, lovely evening.''
By the end of that day, ``Chaim's Love Song'' had taken in $5,000
in ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   The only person possibly more excited than Cox and Gaynes was
playwright Marvin Chernoff, a San Fernando Valley resident who'd
come to New York with his wife, Sharon Bloom, for the opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt like that in my life,'' recalls Chernoff, 66,
a professor in the department of educational psychology and
counseling at California State University, Northridge who took up
play-writing as a hobby 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm normally very restrained. I went to the curb and pumped my
arms like Mark McGwire: `Yes! Yes! Yes!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Six months and some 200 performances later, Chernoff's
warmhearted, nostalgic comedy about a retired Brooklyn Jewish
mailman is still packing 'em in at the Raymond J. Greenwald
Theatre, 307 W. 26th St. in New York's bohemian Chelsea district. A
few weeks ago, its producers announced the show would extend its
run there indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   That news was nowhere more welcome than 3,000 miles away in Los
Angeles, where ``Chaim's Love Song'' has deep roots.
</P>
<P>
   Initially developed at First Stage of L.A., a collective of
actors, writers and directors that operates out of the Hollywood
Methodist Church, the play received its first reading three years
ago at the West Coast Jewish Theatre and ran for 5{ months last
spring at the Bitter Truth Theatre in North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Chernoff says he based the title character, 75-year-old Chaim
Schotsky, on a 90-year-old Russian immigrant cousin of his, a
onetime furrier and first-rate raconteur.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the joys was, on Labor Day, he came to see it,''
Chernoff says. ``He's practically blind now, and he's widowed after
56 years, but he brought his girlfriend from his senior citizens
center.''
</P>
<P>
   When the show moved to off-Broadway last summer, its cast was
about half made up of L.A. actors, including Allen Bloomfield as
Chaim and Kathleen Marshall as the play's catalyst, a naive young
Iowa transplant who befriends him.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall is the actress-daughter of Hollywood producer/director
Garry Marshall (``Pretty Woman,'' ``Happy Days''), who also owns
the Falcon Theatre in Toluca Lake. In New York, the show is being
presented by Cox's American Renegade Theatre in association with
Gaynes and two other Valley producers, David Billotti and Leslie
deBeauvais, who is executive director of Theatre of Hope for Abused
Women (T.H.A.W.).
</P>
<P>
   The play has other Valley ties. Cox, 61, who directed the New
York production, is artistic director of the American Renegade and
is credited with conceiving the idea for the NoHo (North Hollywood)
Arts District, a city-sponsored confederation of more than 30
mostly small storefront theaters, galleries, restaurants and other
businesses centered around the intersection of Lankershim and
Magnolia boulevards.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynes, 51, another local theater mainstay, runs the Two Roads
Theatre in Studio City and is president of the Valley Theatre
League and the just-opened Whitmore-Lindley Theatre Center in North
Hollywood. In addition, he produced several one-person off-Broadway
shows, including ``Einstein: A Stage Portrait'' at the Greenwald,
``Mattie: An Evening With Christy Mathewson'' at the Lambs' Theatre
and ``Bein' With Behan'' at the Irish Repertory Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gaynes was uncertain when Cox first approached him with the
idea of taking ``Chaim's Love Song'' to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was David's vision, it really was,'' Gaynes says. ``He
called me up and he said I (should) take this show to New York. And
I said, `Oh, that's a big step!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Chernoff also was unsure about plunging into the New York fish
tank, where off-Broadway production costs can run up to 10 times
higher than in Los Angeles _ typically $12,000 to $30,000 per week
_ and the critics have sharp teeth.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, performance space has become tough to find in New
York, where a resurgent off-Broadway scene combined with a
buffed-out economy have created intense competition among
producers.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the lure of New York proved irresistible. Gaynes called
the Greenwald, and, he says, ``Amazingly enough, they were
available.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a baseball player, you want to play in the majors,
if you're a math professor you want to teach at MIT,'' says Gaynes,
a former actor who has performed in 13 Broadway and off-Broaday
shows. ``We're all L.A. people now, but there's nothing like New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox echoes the sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, my dream was Broadway, but off-Broadway is close
enough,'' he says only half-joking.
</P>
<P>
   Chernoff says he still can't believe the way his ``hobby'' seems
to have taken on a creative life all its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about taking a blank piece of paper and
writing something very personal that is your own. The only thing I
can compare it to is like a woman giving birth,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Chernoff is busily working on a new play, ``Showtime
at the Sheldon Pincus Senior Citizens Center,'' a nostalgic farce
set in the milieu of turn-of-the-century Yiddish burlesque theater.
Gaynes is producing the show, which is scheduled to open sometime
in April at the Whitmore-Lindley Theatre. &UR;  &LR; It will be directed by
Gaynes' wife, Pamela Hall, an accomplished Broadway and regional
theater actress.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Chaim's Love Song,'' will it be heard in L.A. again
anytime soon?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a possibility,'' says Gaynes. ``It certainly is not the
next thing on the agenda. Right now we're negotiating with theaters
in Florida, Ohio, Atlanta and various cities.''
</P>
<P>
   As they say in New York, start spreadin' the news.

   SMITH AND MEISSNER COOPERATE ON BORDER PATROL FUNDS
</P>
<P>
   380&AMP;add
</P>
<P>
   BY ANDREW MOLLISON
</P>
<P>
   C.1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two weeks after threatening to request the
resignation of Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner
Doris Meissner, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, promised Thursday to
push for an additional 1,000 agents for her agency's border patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of Smith's threat, Meissner had dropped
consideration of a controversial proposal to deal with overcrowded
INS detention facilities by releasing some of the nonviolent
offenders who must be detained under the 1996 law. The Clinton
administration also is preparing a request for $80 million in
emergency funds to build more detention facilities.
</P>
<P>
   While chairing Thursday's hearing of his immigration
subcommittee, Smith showed that Meissner's response had satisfied
him. He and Meissner united in making a case for stationing more
agents than President Clinton had suggested along the
2,000-mile-long land portion of the border between the United
States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy percent of the illegal drugs entering the United
States come across our Southwestern border,'' Smith said. ``Yet the
administration requested not one additional Border Patrol agent in
its proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress in 1996 authorized an additional 1,000 agents a year
through 2001. Clinton last year proposed adding only 500 in this
fiscal year, but Congress boosted that to 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's failure to call for another 1,000 agents for next year
was condemned by Rep. Silvestre Reyes, R-Texas, a retired border
control chief now in Congress. He testified via satellite TV from
El Paso, where he was attending an international meeting on global
migration.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting on a survey by his staff of the six border control
chiefs for Texas, Reyes said, ``Each and every one of them said
they desperately need more agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the bureaucrat's dream of testifying before
legislators who insisted that her kingdom should grow, Meissner
offered a tepid defense of Clinton's budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have exceeded the president's goal of 7,000 agents by
2000,'' she said, recalling Clinton's pledge from his 1992
campaign. But she added, ``We need more agents and we will continue
to advocate for more agents.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   The INS had fewer than 4,000 agents on border duty just five
years ago. That will be up to nearly 9,000 after it meets its goal
of a net increase of 1,000 during this fiscal year, Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   In what Smith described as the most well-documented report ever
submitted to his subcommittee, Frank D. Bean and two other
migration researchers from the University of Texas at Austin
concluded that effective control of the U.S.-Mexico land border
using current technology would require 16,000 border control
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Successful border control would then force illegal immigrants to
use other methods, such as overstaying their tourist visas, Bean
testified.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said Clinton's budget includes money to make agents
more effective by erecting 200 tall poles with motion-triggered
video cameras and lights along the border and building 20 new
facilities to provide work space for the greatly expanded patrol.
Texas and California, where key subcommittee members live, would
get 17 of the new facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Clinton asked for an 8 percent budget increase next
year for the INS _ far more than the 1.7 percent average for the
rest of the Department of Justice or the standpat budgets proposed
for many other departments.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes said that informants within the border patrol told him
that hiring and training for new agents is so far behind schedule
that the INS can't meet its goal of adding 1,000 new agents by
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, we have had some difficulties with recruiting,''
due to increased competition for job-seekers, Meissner
acknowledged. But, she added, ``We absolutely will add 1,000 border
patrol agents. We will be training many more than that, to allow
for attrition as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the hearing room, civil rights advocate Joel Najar of
the National Council of La Raza said he was afraid that the influx
of so many young agents would contribute to ``incidents of abuse
and violence at the border.''
</P>
<P>
   But Meissner said, ``We are getting a very high quality border
patrol officer. Over half have gone to college.''

   &LR; DUSTY SPRINGFIELD/``DUSTY IN MEMPHIS,'' ``DUSTY IN LONDON''
(Rhino/Atlantic)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Springfield's rich voice was perfect for r&AMP;b, a fact confirmed
when she signed with Atlantic and unleashed ``Dusty in Memphis'' 30
years ago. The groundbreaking album, reissued here in a deluxe
edition with 14 bonus tracks, still sounds as fresh and soulful as
ever. Backed by Memphis studio hands like guitarist Reggie Young,
bassist Tommy Cogbill, keyboardist Bobby Emmons and background
singers the Sweet Inspirations, Dusty _ currently seriously ill in
her native Britain _ puts across classic material such as ``Just a
Little Lovin','' ``Son of a Preacher Man'' and ``Breakfast in Bed''
like a slowly simmering Aretha. The companion album, ``Dusty in
London,'' collects material Springfield cut in the UK also while
under contract to Atlantic. More pop than r&AMP;b, the album features
24 obscure but enjoyable tracks. 4 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster
</P>
<P>
   MILES DAVIS/``LOVE SONGS'' (Legacy/Columbia)
</P>
<P>
   This well-selected thematic compilation of romantic ballads by
the world's greatest composers is drawn primarily from Davis' first
era with Columbia, 1957 to 1963. Drifting from the lush orchestral
arrangements of Gil Evans on the Gershwin/Weill piece ``My Ship''
through ``Stella by Starlight'' with the great sextet that recorded
``Kind of Blue'' (Bill Evans, John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley,
Paul Chambers and Jimmy Cobb) to the '60s quintets on ``Summer
Night'' and a 15-minute version of ``My Funny Valentine,'' these
are eloquent, lyrical sounds. 4 stars

<P>
   _ Fred Shuster
</P>
<P>
   BILL WYMAN &AMP; THE RHYTHM KINGS/``ANYWAY THE WIND BLOWS'' (Velvel)
</P>
<P>
   The ex-Rolling Stones bassist describes his second low-key solo
effort as a few pals having a good time. Aside from the core group,
the album features guitar work from such esteemed players as Eric
Clapton, Albert Lee, former Stone Mick Taylor and others. The song
selection is varied, and gritty originals like ``Ring My Bell'' and
``Crazy He Calls Me'' work well next to classic numbers like the
J.J. Cale-penned title track, Willie Dixon's ``Too Late'' and Mose
Allison's ``Days Like This.'' The emphasis on spontaneity and
first-take feel over note-perfect precision comes through loud and
clear. 3 stars

</P>
<P>
   EDDIE HINTON/``HARD LUCK GUY'' (Capricorn)
</P>
<P>
   An integral part of the renowned Muscle Shoals studio mafia,
late guitarist-singer Hinton is widely regarded as perhaps the
premier white Southern soul artist. Fans of Otis Redding and Al
Green will be drawn to the gritty, dusky vocals and impassioned
musicianship on this fine collection of previously unreleased songs
mostly cut just before Hinton's death in 1995. 3 1/2 stars

   STEVE EARLE AND THE DEL MCCOURY BAND/``THE MOUNTAIN''
(E-Squared)
</P>
<P>
   This loose, perfectly realized tribute to crusty bluegrass
granddad Bill Monroe was sparked by Earle's 1995 one-song
collaboration with the McCoury band, generally considered the
premier traditional bluegrass outfit around. Here, the mercurial
Earle settles into some sharp work, especially on ``I'm Still in
Love With You,'' a duet with a heartbroken Iris DeMent. Earle has
said the title track just might be the best song he's ever written,
and you'll get no argument here. The album closes with ``Pilgrim,''
featuring a who's-who of modern country, including Emmylou Harris,
Gillian Welch, Marty Stuart, Sam Bush and others. 3 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster
</P>
<P>
   D GENERATION/``THROUGH THE DARKNESS'' (C2)
</P>
<P>
   D Generation is a gritty New York outfit offering
'70s-influenced punk aimed directly at your car radio. For the
band's third ragged but right effort, the accent is on
down-and-dirty New York Dolls-style street rock complete with
trebly guitar solos, scruffy ``na, na, na'' background vocals and
often memorable melodies. Standouts here include the midtempo
``Good Ship Down,'' a grungy ``Only a Ghost,'' and ``Chinatown,'' a
sly guitar-infused tribute to fellow Gotham club angels Television.
Producer Tony Visconti (Bowie, T. Rex, Thin Lizzy) keeps this rowdy
band of fashion-impaired delinquents humming like a jailhouse
generator. 2 1/2 stars

</P>
<P>
   IMPERIAL TEEN/``WHAT IS NOT TO LOVE'' (Slash/London)
</P>
<P>
   File Imperial Teen's simple pop with a twist under
``bubblegrunge.'' A perfect example is the crafty alt-rock radio
favorite ``Yoo Hoo,'' which updates T. Rex's sonic spirit with some
rhythmic creativity that recalls modern r&AMP;b. Other strong cuts on
the band's largely entertaining glam-tinged sophomore release
include ``Lipstick'' and the misfit anthem ``Birthday Girl.'' A
worthy successor to 1996's ``Seasick.'' 3 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster
</P>
<P>
   KELLY WILLIS/``WHAT I DESERVE'' (Ryko)
</P>
<P>
   American roots music is doing better than ever these days, a
trend that gives talented Austin-based country singer Willis hope.
This smooth and engrossing set of self-penned tunes, co-written
material and choice covers from the likes of Nick Drake and Paul
Westerberg should introduce Willis' gutsy, lonesome and blue style
to a new audience. Album-opener and first single ``Take Me Down''
from her long-awaited fourth album and Ryko debut is the obvious
radio track, but other standouts including ``Heaven Bound,'' ``Not
Forgotten You'' and ``Talk Like That'' also boast potential. 3
stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster
</P>
<P>
   J.J. JOHNSON/``HEROES'' (Verve)
</P>
<P>
   A hero to many, Johnson is justifiably considered to be one of
the greatest trombone players in jazz history. He's 75 now, but he
hasn't lost anything as a player or composer. This wonderful new
album contains seven original compositions, as well as worthwhile
covers of Miles Davis' ``Blue in Green'' and John Coltrane's ``Blue
Train.'' The originals range from hard-swinging post-bop
(``Ten-85''), polished ballads (``Vista,'' ``Better Days'') and the
graceful waltzes (dedicated to Johnson's wife) that bookend the
album. Favorite moments: Wayne Shorter's blazing saxophone solo on
the remarkable ``In Walked Wayne'' and pianist Renee Rosnes'
gorgeous work throughout, particularly on the solo piano piece,
``Vista.'' Highly recommended. 3 1/2 stars

 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's something about deadly epidemics that both
terrifies and fascinates people, drawing viewers not only to
science fiction movies but also to museums. One of the
best-attended exhibitions ever mounted by the American Museum of
Natural History was a six-week show in 1908 that drew nearly 1
million people to learn about tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   After a long absence, germs are back at the museum. Saturday a
new exhibition will open in which dozens of infectious-disease
organisms will strut their stuff as computer animations,
eye-catching models, photomicrographs, dioramas and even real (but
dead) disease microorganisms. It is called ``Epidemic! The World of
Infectious Disease,'' and in this viewer's estimation, it is the
most impressive and informative exhibition the museum has mounted
in years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Dr. Rob DeSalle, associate curator of the
museum's entomology department, and David Harvey, vice president
for exhibitions, modelers and craftsmen have assembled a tour
through both the microscopic and human-scale habitats of dozens of
disease organisms, underscoring the vulnerability of all the
world's peoples to epidemics.
</P>
<P>
   In his story ``The Masque of the Red Death,'' Edgar Allan Poe
described the nightmarish futility of trying to wall oneself off
from an epidemic-ravaged world. The museum's exhibition drives home
that theme with a vengeance. As the show demonstrates, the vectors
that spread epidemics take countless forms. A vector may be a deer
mouse carrying the deadly hantavirus. It may be a mosquito
transferring malarial parasites from its gut to the blood cells and
liver of a human victim.
</P>
<P>
   In at least one case, the vector of a disease outbreak was a
Komodo dragon that licked the bars of its cage. Children visiting
the zoo touched the cage bars, licked their fingers, and were thus
infected by Salmonella bacteria from the big lizard.
</P>
<P>
   No one is immune to every disease organism to which he or she
may be exposed, and human beings have had to learn to live with
their microbial tormenters and invaders. The result is a
never-ending battle between disease organisms seeking to penetrate
and overwhelm their prey, and the immune system, which must
constantly adapt itself to meet new threats.
</P>
<P>
   The adaptations themselves can have bad side effects. In Africa,
sickle cell anemia evolved as a ``scorched earth'' strategy by the
body for thwarting malaria parasites. A genetic tendency that
evolved over many centuries by which red blood cells are deformed
into sickle shapes reduces their ability to metabolize nutrients.
But it also deprives malarial parasites of a hospitable habitat,
thereby resisting invasion by the parasites. Unfortunately, sickle
cell anemia, common among African-Americans, is itself a
debilitating disease that renders a person vulnerable to infection.
</P>
<P>
   Among many gadgets devised for the show is the shadow outline of
a human being lying on the floor. By stepping on any part of the
shadow, a viewer can call up a display showing the disease
organisms that may inhabit the corresponding part of the body.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the many interactive computer demonstrations created
for this exhibition, two players, one representing the immune
system and the other playing the role of a pathogen, try to outwit
each other, mimicking the complex and ever-changing strategies
played by real immune systems and microbes like the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   The primary goal of the show is to enhance public health, and
its major focus is sexually transmitted diseases, especially AIDS.
But the exhibition is also a compact introductory course in
microbiology and epidemiology, with something of interest for both
a young child and a mature college graduate.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is organized to represent both the passage of
time and the chains of causal links that spread disease.
</P>
<P>
   After watching a video introduction, the visitor walks through
sections representing successive stages of various diseases:
exposure, infection, outbreak, epidemic and finally pandemic, the
global spread of an epidemic. The specific diseases viewers can
follow through the exhibition include hantavirus, malaria,
influenza, tuberculosis, AIDS, a disease-causing version of the
ubiquitous E. coli bacterium and Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors learn the distinguishing features of five groups of
notorious pathogens: viruses, bacteria, protists, fungi (including
yeasts), and helminths (parasitic worms). The recent outbreak of
Ebola in Africa is briefly described, and several exhibits recall
the devastating influenza epidemic of 1918.
</P>
<P>
   The stars of the show are models made by the museum staff. One
of the most impressive is a complex model, 2 million times as large
as life and some six feet high, of a human T-cell, a component of
the immune system. The model depicts an attack by spherical
molecules of the HIV organism. The intricacy of the details of the
huge sculpture make it a masterpiece of the modeler's art.
</P>
<P>
   Another spectacular model represents the lining of a human
stomach invaded by a strain of E. coli bacteria that has absorbed
genes from shigella, an organism that causes dysentery. In
adjoining sections, this huge model (which viewers are invited to
touch) depicts the stomach's production of mucous to ward off the
E. coli bacteria, the bacteria's eventual victory and the bloody
destruction of the stomach lining.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most finely detailed of the models is that of a
paramecium, a harmless protozoan that inhabits stagnant ponds. The
museum modeler who built it, Vivian Stillwell, included not only
the organism's internal parts but some 2,000 hairlike cilia, the
external fibers paramecia use to propel themselves in quest of
food.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biology presented in this show may baffle some
visitors. A few of the display labels seem to assume a basic
knowledge of the nature and structure of proteins, for example.
Unfamiliar terms like macrophage, T-cytotoxic cells, the CD-4
molecule and reverse transcriptase are loosely defined but not
thoroughly explained, and casual viewers may sometimes feel adrift
in technical jargon.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it is probably too much to expect that an ordinary
museum visitor would emerge from the show as an expert in
immunology, microbiology and epidemiology. The excellence of the
models, the arresting lighting and the animations make up for the
brevity (and perhaps oversimplification) of some of the labels. All
who visit the show except professional experts are certain to
enlarge their knowledge of infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
   While emphasizing the global need to check the course of
epidemic diseases, the exhibition makes the point that
technological progress is not necessarily benign. The ancient
Romans, by building reservoirs, inadvertently created new niches in
Europe for malarial mosquitoes, for example, and by building
irrigation networks to draw water from the Nile, ancient Egyptians
opened pathways for the spread of schistosomiasis (snail fever
caused by blood flukes) throughout the Nile Delta.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Global warming, whether caused by human activity or natural
agencies, presents another disease threat, the exhibition shows.
When temperate regions warm up, they offer new habitats for
malarial mosquitoes and the insects that transmit Chagas disease
and other pandemic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Clever dioramas built for the exhibition represent some of the
best-known epidemics; two brown rats climbing down a ship's hawser
suggest the arrival of plague in 14th-century Venice, for example,
and a truck unloading produce represents an outbreak of salmonella
food poisoning. A hand pump symbolizes the discovery in 1854 by
John Snow that water from a pump had infected an entire English
community with cholera.
</P>
<P>
   History has been punctuated and molded by epidemics for at least
as long as human beings have left records, and for every old
scourge brought under control _ smallpox, for example _ some
vicious newcomer seems to crop up. The museum's epidemic exhibition
may not offer sweeping solutions, but it can help a new generation
of would-be microbe hunters learn the basics of their challenging
craft in an entertaining way.

`CONCEIVING ADA': CALLING BYRON'S DAUGHTER, INVENTOR OF A
COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)

   What if computer science advanced to the point that it were
possible to view historical events by processing the information in
old photographs? Taking things to the next step, might it then be
possible to glean enough genetic information about a historical
figure to penetrate time itself and carry on two-way conversation
with someone who died in the 19th century?
</P>
<P>
   That's the intriguing premise of Lynn Hershman Leeson's film,
``Conceiving Ada,'' a movie that is much better at throwing out
ideas than at telling a story or at creating compelling characters.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Leeson's cyber-fantasy, which opens Friday in Manhattan,
Emmy Coer (Francesca Faridany), a contemporary computer whiz
experimenting with artificial reality, is obsessed with the life of
Ada Byron King (Tilda Swinton), the mathematically gifted daughter
of Lord Byron.
</P>
<P>
   Ada, who died of uterine cancer in 1852 at the age of 37, is
widely credited with having developed the world's first computer
program. A machine called the Analytic Engine, which she conceived
with a collaborator, Charles Babbage (John O'Keefe), is today
recognized as a direct forerunner of the modern computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conceiving Ada'' parallels Emmy's life with Ada's. Both have
nagging, meddlesome mothers (played by Karen Black) who try to
suppress their daughters' creativity and re-direct their lives
toward more conventional domestic goals.
</P>
<P>
   Both have lovers who resent their work and interfere with it.
Ada, like her father, has several lovers, as well as a spouse. Emmy
has a boyfriend, Nicholas (J.D. Wolfe), who pressures her to have a
baby.
</P>
<P>
   Putting in a bizarre appearance is an alarmingly gaunt Timothy
Leary (whose death in 1996 dates this movie by at least three
years) as Emmy's mentor, Sims.
</P>
<P>
   A director's statement in the film's production notes states
that ``Conceiving Ada'' was ``structured around the idea of a
double helix.'' ``Every scene,'' the notes say, ``was structured
and shot using a DNA image as a model for actors' placement and
camera movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Amplifying the theme of artificial reality is the movie's use of
virtual sets in the 19th-century settings that show, among other
things, a fake-looking electronic fire flickering in the hearth of
Ada's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   While such effects lend the look of the film a stylish
technological gloss, they also contribute to its overall air of
woodenness and shrill didacticism. Ada is painted as a feminist
martyr whose work, just like Emmy's, is threatened with co-optation
by an envious and less intelligent male collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be fair to give away the ending in which Ada and
Emmy establish the ultimate connection. Suffice it to say, it's a
much soberer and technologically sophisticated version of Julie
Christie's fate in the 1977 film ``Demon Seed.''

`8MM': A BUTTONED-DOWN CHARACTER IN A WILD, WICKED WORLD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joel Schumacher's ``Eight Millimeter'' delves into
the perverse underworld of the pornography business, shocking
audiences with the realization that sex and violence can be so
dull. Though the film moves, according to production notes, ``from
the lurid sidewalks of LA's Hollywood Boulevard to the squalor of
New York's meat-packing district,'' it's also a story that ends
with leaf raking on a suburban lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Cage, seriously miscast in the role of a straight-arrow
family man, plays Tom Welles, a private detective from Harrisburg,
Pa. Tom's life is changed forever, as they say, by an assignment
involving a rich and recently deceased tycoon. The man's genteel
widow has found a film reel in his private safe, and it looks as if
the film depicts the authentic slaughter of a teen-age girl. While
watching this film, the star winces and cringes like someone who
has never even seen Nicolas Cage strut through ``Face/Off'' or
``Leaving Las Vegas'' or ``Wild at Heart'' with worldly swagger.
</P>
<P>
   After having been reminded sufficiently that Tom loves his wife
(Catherine Keener, in a surprisingly drab, one-note role) and baby
daughter, ``Eight Millimeter'' sends him hunting for the victim and
her killer. The screenplay, which is by Andrew Kevin Walker but
lacks the heartfelt kinkiness of his ``Seven'' script, plants clues
as regularly as a crumb trail through a forest.
</P>
<P>
   Tom uses missing persons records to identify the girl as Mary
Anne Matthews. Then he visits her mother and happens to discover
Mary Anne's diary inside a plastic bag and hidden in a toilet tank.
Mary Anne helpfully explains that she is headed to Hollywood with a
boyfriend, hoping for a career in show business. Her note
prophetically ends: ``Don't worry about me. Love, Mary Anne.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on, at a church-run shelter, a nun helpfully hands over
Mary Anne's suitcase and a set of new clues.
</P>
<P>
   This finally takes the film where it wants to be: in the midst
of sleaze and shady characters, including Joaquin Phoenix as a
scene-stealing porn shop clerk who becomes Tom's sidekick and
helper. Advised to wear a leather jacket and start asking for the
hard stuff, Tom throws himself into this research and encounters an
assortment of sinister miscreants.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay has fun giving them names like Machine, Max
California and Dino Velvet. Schumacher enlists James Gandolfini,
Peter Stormare and an assortment of piquantly nasty props to give
this part of the film some dramatic color. Visually, it delivers
careful lighting effects in darkly Stygian settings, with the
occasional chic trace of aqua or lime.
</P>
<P>
   What is unrelievedly drab about ``Eight Millimeter'' is Tom
himself. The film seems to intend Tom to discover a darker side of
his own nature while investigating this case, but it barely makes
his reactions apparent. It's never clear what this buttoned-down
character is experiencing in the midst of the film's wild, wicked
stimuli, especially after ``Eight Millimeter'' takes a third-act
turn for a standard thriller plot.
</P>
<P>
   Cage does manage to vanquish hefty villains while handcuffed to
a bed, but what is he thinking?
</P>
<P>
   For a more wrenching account of a man reluctantly dragged into
the porn world, George C. Scott did it far better in Paul
Schrader's ``Hard Core,'' a film with the searing ad line: ``Oh my
God, that's my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether in outrageously flamboyant Bat-mode or directing John
Grisham stories (``The Client,'' ``A Time to Kill'') with cool
proficiency, Schumacher almost invariably breathes more life into
his material than he has here. It's a lot easier to tick off the
forced, farfetched touches in ``Eight Millimeter'' than to count
the ones that ring true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight Millimeter'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). Though it includes profanity, partial
nudity and ugly violence, its depictions of pornography are
relatively discreet.

 ANTIQUES: 20th-CENTURY FURNITURE BARGAINS  
 (bl)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compared with the $8.3 million that an American 18th-century
Newport highboy recently fetched at Sotheby's, the prices paid for
20th-century American antiques seem like yard-sale numbers. If you
pay attention to the pre-sale estimates, some of the best bargains
in 20th-century American furniture may be at Skinner, the Boston
auction house.
</P>
<P>
   On March 6, Skinner will conduct a ``20th-Century Furniture and
Decorative Arts'' sale, with 584 lots of art glass and pottery,
Arts and Crafts Movement furniture, Art Deco pieces and Modern
furnishings. (Information: 617-350-5400.) There are nearly enough
Stickley pieces in the sale to furnish a house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stickley antiques went way up in price years ago, and stayed
up,'' said John Stewart, a New York art adviser who sometimes buys
antiques for his clients. ``The commonplace Arts and Crafts pieces,
the mass-produced ones, plateaued in value ages ago. It's only the
rare pieces that go for a lot now.''
</P>
<P>
   Although mass-produced, some pieces in the Skinner sale were
designed by Gustav Stickley (1858-1942), an American furniture
maker, businessman and publisher who was probably the greatest
influence on the American Arts and Crafts Movement. (His brothers'
mass-produced pieces, from the L. &AMP; J.G. Stickley firm, seem less
sought after.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1898, Gustav Stickley started United Crafts, a company of his
own in Eastwood, N.Y., near Syracuse. In 1901, he founded The
Craftsman, a magazine that extolled the virtues of sturdy, honest,
plain furniture.
</P>
<P>
   For Stickley, ornament was unnecessary. He wanted to design
affordable furniture of solid construction and good craftsmanship.
Even though it was factory produced, much of the furniture was made
of oak and purposely showed off the dowels and joints.
</P>
<P>
   In 1906, he moved to New York City. There, he overextended
himself. He went bankrupt in 1915. The Craftsman closed the
following year. ``He was a basically a synthesizer of others' ideas
and an entrepreneur,'' said Alexandra Anderson-Spivy, the editor of
an eight-disk digital replica of 183 issues of Stickley's magazine,
``The Craftsman on CD-ROM.'' The disks, published by Interactive
Bureau, are revolutionizing the study of the movement.
</P>
<P>
   The Gustav Stickley pieces in the Skinner sale include a
two-door, glass-fronted bookcase made between 1904-12 (estimate
$6,000 to $8,000); an oak side chair with three vertical back slats
over a rush seat ($200 to $300); an oak footstool, circa 1912, with
its original leather ($400 to $600); a single-drawer writing desk,
circa 1912-16 ($1,000 to $1,500), and a round occasional table,
circa 1907-12 ($1,200 to $1,800). The Skinner sale also includes
pieces made by his brothers' company and other contemporary firms.
</P>
<P>
   The 1930s are represented by a pair of classic lamps designed by
the renowned French designer Jean-Michel Frank in 1935. The
15-inch-tall table lamps are each in the form of a letter ``U''
with small shades. They are cream-colored and very handsome
(estimate $2,000 to $3,000).
</P>
<P>
   The sale's modern furniture from the 1950s includes some
examples by the American furniture designer Paul McCobb
(1917-1969).
</P>
<P>
   The '50s, of course, are hot. ``Prices have exploded: they have
gone up at least 100 percent in the last two years for anything of
decent quality,'' said Stewart, who recently furnished the
apartment of a Whitney Museum trustee with 1950s pieces. ``The
trend for '50s furniture has brought in a secondary market. You are
beyond the bargain hunters who are decorating their first house or
an apartment in the East Village. The '50s are now an accepted
collecting area and an accepted fashion statement. So you have lots
of people with real money chasing it. That means that condition and
rarity are now much more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul McCobb is not on the super-hot decorators' list, so the
major 1950s antiques galleries in New York, like Modernica, 41,
1950 and New World Furniture, don't tend to carry his designs.
Nonetheless, many people are looking for pieces by McCobb, a
painter, decorator and display designer, who created several lines
for different furniture companies. In 1949, for example, he
designed a successful low-cost modular line called the Planner
Group for the Winchedon Furniture Company in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   McCobb's work, which is illustrated in ``Fifties Furniture'' by
Leslie Pina (Schiffer Publishing, 1996), is not too dissimilar from
Charles and Ray Eames' designs of the time. Planner Group pieces in
the Skinner sale include a long, low, six-drawer maple bureau
(estimate $400 to $600); a two-foot-wide, three-drawer maple bureau
with tall, spindly tapered wooden legs ($300-$500); a matching
two-drawer night stand ($250 to $350) and a bookcase with two open
shelves, supported on a platform stand with short tapered legs
($300 to $500).
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s lots at Skinner include a walnut sideboard with three
sliding doors made by George Nakashima (1905-90), one of America's
legendary craftsmen whose work is very much in demand at the
moment. There were Nakashima pieces in Thursday's 20th-century
auction at Tepper in New York, and David Rago of New Hope, Pa.,
plans to include several in his sale in May.
</P>
<P>
   Nakashima, born in Washington state, studied art in France,
architecture at MIT and Japanese carpentry techniques in Japan. In
1943, he set up his own woodworker's shop in New Hope, where he
assembled extraordinary slabs of untrimmed old black walnut and
redwood trees. These thick pieces of wood, often marked by huge
knots, inspired benches, coffee tables and other pieces of fine art
furniture. Clients included Nelson Rockefeller and Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   Nakashima won the American Institute of Architects' Gold Medal
for craftsmanship in 1952 and was made a Fellow of the American
Craft Council in 1979. His daughter, Mira Yarnall-Nakashima,
continues the workshop today, and it is very active. The Nakashima
style has been rediscovered by a new generation of young
architects, like David Ling and Michael Gabellini, who commission
site-specific works for clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``With their raw and unadulterated edges, these pieces of
furniture have the primitive power of their original state yet they
are handcrafted,'' Ling said. ``Nakashima had a talent in choosing
woods and editing them in a beautiful way.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan DeLorenzo, as assistant to the director of the gallery
1950, noted that prices for Nakashima pieces had skyrocketed in
recent years, but added: ``They are timeless.''
</P>
<P>
   The estimate for the Skinner sideboard is $4,000 to $6,000,
which is less than the estimates for the Nakashimas in Sotheby's
sale of 20th-century works of art on March 12. That sale has a 1967
cherry extension dining table ($10,000 to $12,000), a two-door
cherry cabinet ($5,000 to $8,000) and a pedestal desk with chair
($6,000 to $9,000). As Cara Greenberg, author of ``Midcentury
Modern'' (Random House), said, ``George Nakashima is in a category
all by himself.''

SHORT ITEMS ON WHAT`S NEW IN HOME VIDEO 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With no major new titles to rush off for this week, maybe it's
time to relax and wet a line with John Lurie in ``Fishing With
John,'' a set of three cassettes released on Tuesday by Home
Vision.
</P>
<P>
   Lurie, a composer of movie scores and leader of the jazz group
the Lounge Lizards, wouldn't go fishing for the life of him unless
there was a television show to be made out of it.
</P>
<P>
   A while ago he made six half-hour shows with five friends: the
director Jim Jarmusch, the actor and singer Tom Waits and the
actors Matt Dillon, Willem Dafoe and Dennis Hopper. Last year they
were shown on Bravo and the Independent Film Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect savvy fishing talk and perfect casts that land a
plug right by the bass snout. These shows are more about nothing in
particular than they are about fishing. ``Why am I here?'' asks
Jarmusch while fishing for sharks with Lurie.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the series there is no real answer to that question,
other than the fact that Lurie found some production money in Japan
and asked these people to go fishing with him.
</P>
<P>
   He fishes with Jarmusch off Long Island. Waits' episode is in
Jamaica, Dillon's in Costa Rica, Dafoe's in Maine and Hopper's in
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Lurie and Jarmusch actually catch a shark, a thrashing
10-footer; otherwise the action is light. ``There are fish in the
water, but when they aren't hungry there is no way to catch them,''
Waits says.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody in the series has two things in common: They fished a
little when they were boys, and they used cheese as bait. ``How
often do fish get a chance at the finer cheeses?'' Waits asks.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, much of this makes passable entertainment.
Fishless for hours, some participants appear to come unhinged.
Under a hot sun in Thailand, Hopper suddenly announces that if you
watch his film ``Easy Rider'' very closely, you will notice that
the character he portrays doesn't necessarily die at the end. That,
he says, opens the door for a sequel. &QL;

   ``French films basically have low budgets and really low
budgets,'' said Donna Sayada, ``so what Americans would consider A
and B movies just get lumped together into French cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   With her husband Ms. Sayada runs Video France in Bethesda, Md.,
a distributor of older French films on video. American attitudes
about newer ones don't help. ``Americans try to judge French movies
by American standards,'' she said. ``Production and budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, though, Video France issued two French films that
should transcend those standards: ``La Bandera'' (``Escape From
Yesterday''), about a wanted man who joins the Foreign Legion, and
``La Horse,'' about a farmer who defends his place against heroin
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Both films star the legendary Jean Gabin. ``La Bandera'' came in
1935 near the start of his career; ``La Horse'' was made in 1970,
near the end. Information: (800) 835-7537; www.francevision.com. &QL;

   Neil LaBute's film exudes the same cool sexual fury as his ``In
the Company of Men,'' so the effect is by now familiar. There is
nothing in any way relieving to report about any of the three male
characters, who have little on their minds beyond an obsession with
sexual performance. Cary (Jason Patric, left), a macho
gynecologist, berates a conquest for bloodying his sheets. Jerry
(Ben Stiller) believes that sex is all that matters while Barry
(Aaron Eckhardt), a middle-aged husband, is impotent.
</P>
<P>
   As examples of LaBute's idea of self-annihilating manhood, Janet
Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``they're hard to watch and
even harder to forget.'' &QL;

   As an 8-year-old, Lara (Tatjana Trieb) is an adept surrogate for
her deaf parents (Howie Seago and Emmanuelle Laborit), speaking
both German and sign language, taking their phone calls and even
acting as the ears in parent-teacher conferences.
</P>
<P>
   But the accommodation becomes uncomfortable when Lara discovers
she is musically gifted and wants a concert career. By the time she
is a young woman, in fact, Lara (now played by Sylvie Testud) has
become edgy and introverted and eventually leaves to enroll in a
Berlin conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   Though Caroline Link's film loses focus before finally turning
warm and fuzzy, ``its hardheaded performances tug against the
sentimentality'' (Stephen Holden). &QL;

   Teen-age horror films may finally wear out their welcome, but
not this time. Mixing familiar young television stars (Alicia Witt,
Jared Leto, Joshua Jackson) with familiar older cult figures
(Robert Englund, of Freddie Krueger fame, and John Neville), an old
story stays surprisingly fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Again there's a killer loose on campus; this one hangs people
and cooks pets in the microwave. Audiences may guess who the killer
is, but Jamie Blanks' first feature film has ``an edgy sense of
humor, a tricky plot and characters too genre-savvy for their own
good'' (Anita Gates). &QL;

   In a futuristic stew of a world, an aging soldier warrior named
Todd (Kurt Russell) with his name tattooed on one cheek and his
combat record inscribed on his bicep is shown the door after
society comes up with a genetically enhanced breed of soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Dumped on a planet reserved for refuse, he is nurtured by a
colony of peace-loving pioneers who are also stranded there. Soon
Todd is back in fighting form and ready to take on his tormentors
in a high-testosterone but predictable fantasy ``that is much
better at the wind-up than at the pitch'' (Holden). &QL;

`ALICE IN WONDERLAND': NO ADVENTURE BUT SOMETHING TO SEE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)

 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
Remembering, Yet Again, 
What the Dormouse Said 
Still Chasing That Rabbit, 
And Going Large and Small 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Alice struggles to hang onto the squirming flamingo she is
using as a croquet mallet, the hedgehog acting as the ball makes a
face and curls itself into a perfect round shape. In this mad
croquet game, the flamingos and hedgehogs are from Jim Henson's
Creature Shop, and they are among the dozens of delightful puppets
and animatronic characters that populate NBC's version of
Wonderland.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda Richardson strolls around as the screeching Queen of
Hearts, her painted-on eyebrows and hair making her look as if she
were, in fact, a playing card come to life. And in an inspired bit
of casting, Robbie Coltrane and George Wendt turn up as Tweedledum
and Tweedledee. With all that color and invention, why is NBC's
three-hour ``Alice in Wonderland'' so flat?
</P>
<P>
   When this Alice (Tina Majorino) follows the White Rabbit
underground, it's as if she emerges in a theme park. Along for the
ride, viewers glide past each episode as if watching vivid
tableaux: there's the mad tea party, there's the Cheshire Cat! The
film is a series of pretty set pieces that are never engaging.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason Lewis Carroll called his most famous book
``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his dream world creates one of the most memorable and
eccentric populations ever captured in one book, it is above all an
adventure; its most energetic action, though, is a matter of
storytelling and imagination. Adventure is missing from more than
the title of NBC's ``Alice in Wonderland,'' a quasi-faithful
version that preserves the shell but not the essence of Carroll's
tale.
</P>
<P>
   The film is, however, a triumph of design and smooth computer
effects. With a look based on John Tenniel's classic illustrations,
right down to Alice's pinafore and striped stockings, it leaps off
the screen. Playing cards paint white rose bushes red; Alice grows
taller than the trees, then shrinks to the size of a mushroom with
magical ease.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Alice'' roughly follows the outline of ``Alice's
Adventures in Wonderland,'' from her tumble down the rabbit hole to
her presence in the kingdom where the Queen of Hearts shrieks,
``Off with their heads!'' on a whim.
</P>
<P>
   The episodic structure of Carroll's tale allows the film to
comfortably bring in characters from the book's sequel, ``Through
the Looking Glass.'' Tweedledum and Tweedledee, those bizarrely
overgrown bratty boys, are the best of those ``Looking Glass''
exiles.
</P>
<P>
   The croquet game may be the film's highlight, but other episodes
stand out. It is impossible to ruin a mad tea party especially when
Martin Short plays a Hatter who dances on the table. Gene Wilder is
touching and funny as the sad Mock Turtle, singing ``Soup of the
evening/Beautiful Soup.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the film is a feast of casting, other characters are
less successful. Ben Kingsley plays the hookah-smoking Caterpillar,
changed here into Major Caterpillar. With gold braids on his red
military jacket, he looks more like Sergeant Pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Whoopi Goldberg's face appears on the computer-generated,
here-and-then-gone body of the Cheshire Cat, drawn in shades of
black and white that create an eerily unreal effect. But like so
much in this star-laden ``Alice,'' the Cat is less likely to
inspire wonder than the recognition, ``There's Whoopi.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem comes from the frame tacked onto Carroll's story
in this version, written by Peter Barnes (a co-writer of
``Merlin,'' last year's far more enchanting NBC special by the some
producers).
</P>
<P>
   At the start, an unhappy Alice is being forced to sing at her
parents' garden party. Fleeing in panic, she falls asleep under a
tree and dreams of Wonderland, which is filled with variations of
the party guests.
</P>
<P>
   In the garden, Ms. Richardson had been playing croquet and Short
wearing an outrageous hat. The frame itself is not a terrible idea;
Carroll himself invented the ``Alice'' characters as playful
versions of people that he and his inspiration, Alice Liddell,
knew.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the device turns Alice's underground journey
into one long anxiety dream. Every now and then she stops to
remember she doesn't want to go back to reality and sing.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end, Alice declares, ``I am confident.'' The White
Rabbit replies, ``Then you don't need us anymore,'' and she returns
home. Playing therapist is not a natural role for the Rabbit,
however Freudian a context some people choose to impose on
``Alice.''
</P>
<P>
   The film keeps much of Carroll's language, but even on the page
that language requires savoring and scrutiny; here it flashes by
too quickly even to register as gleeful nonsense verse. And though
Ms. Majorino is sometimes as petulant as Alice should be, more
often she is pallid, traipsing through Wonderland without a
sufficient sense of wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've too much to say for yourself, Alice,'' the King of
Hearts warns her, mere seconds before the house of cards tumbles
all around her. If only he were right.
</P>

LIFE ISN'T EASY FOR AMERICAN BIATHLON TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM REYNOLDS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ Kristina Viljanen Sabasteanski once ate
nothing but jam sandwiches on wheat bread for more than a week,
because she spent her last $20 on small-bore rifle ammunition she
needed for practice.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Teela bought his first pair of nordic skis from a friend
at his high school, only to meet a girl who competed in his
school's cross-country club. Three years later, he was competing at
the international level.
</P>
<P>
   Kara Salmela racked up a $700 phone bill one month calling her
husband, because the two are forced to spend so much time apart. In
1998, she spent less than three months at home, she estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The unique stories of sacrifice and adversity go on and on. Such
is life for the U.S. Biathlon Team, which is hosting a World Cup
event this weekend at the Mount VanHoevenberg Olympic Sports
Complex in Lake Placid. The competition continues through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time a World Cup event has been held on American
soil, and the first significant international biathlon event in the
United States since 1987, when Josh Thompson shocked the world by
claiming the silver medal at the world championships on this same
Lake Placid loop.
</P>
<P>
   The highlights for the team members have been few and far
between since. They toil in anonymity, despite the fact they are
among the best in the world at their sport. They get virtually no
attention, little corporate financial support, and train year-round
knowing that a great finish often means one that winds up nowhere
near the medal podium.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they carry on, striving and striving, pursuing their labor
of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just optimistic it can become more popular here,
someday,'' said Jay Hakkinen, 21, who won the sprint competition at
the World Junior Championships in 1997, flashing a beacon that the
U.S. program may soon be ready to lose its perennial underdog tag.
``We have all the elements of a great story. We're getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Biathlon's identity crisis, first of all, starts with the
popular misnomer that it is a cousin of the triathlon and is
composed of some combination of running, swimming and cycling. What
the sport actually is a combination of nordic skiing and precision
rifle shooting, where competitors carry lightweight .22-caliber
rifles on their back while skiing and stop to shoot from both
standing and prone positions.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the sport ranks as high as winter standards like ice
hockey and ski jumping, but in America, it's almost something
people discover by accident.
</P>
<P>
   Teela and Salmela both were fine amateur swimmers before
discovering nordic skiing. Salmela was nearly 18 before she ever
skied; Teela, of Anchorage, Alaska, also didn't pick up skiing
until his late teens.
</P>
<P>
   Another top American woman, 21-year-old Rachel Steer, won two
medals at the 1997 World University Games, is another late bloomer
to the sport. Like Teela, she grew up in Alaska, where she dabbled
in sailing, kayaking, golf, triathlon, fishing and hunting moose
and caribou.
</P>
<P>
   The top European programs, like the ones in Germany and Russia,
have developmental programs where youngsters begin competing in
biathlons by the time they reach the age of 10. Among the
Americans, Hakkinen started competing at the youngest age, 14.
</P>
<P>
   Missing all the early development programs under the watchful
eye of national-level coaches automatically puts the Americans at a
distinct disadvantage compared to the Europeans, but the focus here
is beginning to shift toward building a strong feeder program.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started in juniors (in 1994), the plan was to
medal in the Olympics in 2002,'' Hakkinen said. ``It was an
eight-year plan, almost like it was made for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All we need is experience and confidence,'' Salmela said.
``We're waiting for someone to break through, to be able to say
that if he can do it, I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   They are looking for a breakthrough in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Biathlon program generates virtually no revenue
whatsoever. There are no American corporations that are significant
sponsors of the team, and without the aid of the military, there
would likely be no national program at all.
</P>
<P>
   Salmela, Teela and Sabasteanski are among the U.S. team members
that are subsidized by the National Guard, U.S. Army, or both.
Without that help, all three soldiers say they would be unable to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I come here, I'm put on temporary duty orders, so I'm
paid like a regular National Guard soldier,'' Salmela said. ``The
National Guard has a great program for support, and the Army also
has a World Class Athlete program, where two or three years before
the Olympics they put you on full-time active duty and you
basically train.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just always wanted to go to the Olympics and show the
world that I can get there,'' Teela said. ``Without (the military
assistance), I wouldn't be able to compete, not at this level
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain luster about competing in Lake Placid,
particularly for Sabasteanski, who lived in the village from 1991
through 1994.
</P>
<P>
   She graduated from Castleton (Vt.) State College in 1991, and
after spending five weeks backpacking through Europe, she tied her
mattress to the top of her beat-up Chevrolet Citation and drove to
Lake Placid, arriving at 8 o'clock one night.
</P>
<P>
   Then, she phoned someone she heard was looking for a roommate,
moving in that night with a perfect stranger. She talked her way
into a nighttime job waiting tables at a hotel, worked until
midnight on a regular basis, explaining her penchant for arriving
at morning training sessions late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I was, 20 pounds overweight, hobbling because I broke my
kneecap, and showing up here saying `I want to make the Olympic
team,''' Sabasteanski said. ``It was interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Her plan always was to make the Olympic team and have a top-10
finish in an international event. Both dreams came true last year,
as she competed in Nagano at the Olympics and placed ninth in a
World Cup event.
</P>
<P>
   But she's still here, and that epitomizes the mind-set of the
entire U.S. contingent. There are rays of hope now, with the chance
that maybe, just maybe, with the world watching in Salt Lake City
three years from now, biathlon will finally have its day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going year to year now,'' Sabasteanski said. ``But there's
always that hope of having the perfect race.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a dream the five men and four women who will don the red,
white and blue this weekend all share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years ago, this was like a club where you went to
Europe,'' Hakkinen said. ``Now, it's time to actually start getting
results.''

SCHUMER SAYS MRS. CLINTON `AT THE BEGINNING' OF SENATE DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Thursday that
First Lady Hillary Clinton should take her time in deciding whether
to run for the U.S. Senate next year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is ``at the beginning'' _ rather than at the end _ of
the decision-making process on whether to seek the seat being
vacated by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, who met privately at the White House with Clinton on
Wednesday, said he advised her to take her time about deciding
whether to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's two weeks after the impeachment. She hasn't even come
back to the ground yet on that issue. She needs space. She needs
time,'' said Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be bad for her, bad for New York, bad for America to
make a decision, whichever way it came out, in the next couple of
weeks,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her take some time, think it through thoroughly,''
Schumer told reporters. He said he spent nearly five months making
his decision to run for the Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can put a timetable or deadline on this at
this point,'' said Schumer, New York's junior senator.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was requested by Clinton, said Schumer, who steered
clear of detailing the specifics of the 90-minute session. He
described their meeting as ``a pretty heart-felt conversation about
all sorts of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made no secret about her interest in running for the
Senate. She recently met with Moynihan to discuss her prospects.
</P>
<P>
   She also has consulted with Harold Ickes, the former White House
deputy chief of staff and veteran New York political figure, and
with New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the state
legislature's top Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation over Clinton's candidacy also is being fueled by
statements from her husband, the president.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers are supportive of her undeclared candidacy. In a
statewide poll from Quinnipiac College's Polling Institute released
Tuesday, Clinton was favored over New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani in a possible Senate race by 54 percent to 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier Quinnipiac poll, conducted Jan. 26-Feb. 1, Clinton
led Giuliani 51 percent to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani hasn't declared his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Schumer, a former congressman for 18 years, on
Thursday introduced his first legislation as a senator, sponsoring
bills that would:
</P>
<P>
   - forgive all student loans for teachers who spend five years
teaching at public or private schools;
</P>
<P>
   - spur airline competition by requiring New York's LaGuardia and
JFK airports to give landing and take-off rights to airlines that
would serve smaller communities within 500 miles of New York;
</P>
<P>
   - increase fines and penalties for criminally negligent
polluters;
</P>
<P>
   - and offer $2,000 tax credits for first-time home buyers in
impoverished regions.
</P>
<P>
   His most costly proposal would make all college tuition tax
deductible for families with annual income under $140,000. The plan
would cost $30 billion and Schumer would finance it out of the
federal government's budget surplus.

SHORT NOTES ON THE ART WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three Abstract Expressionist paintings from the
Museum of Modern Art's permanent's collection will soon be on view
at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. It will be the first
time that paintings by Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline and Robert
Motherwell will have been shown in Russia, said Mikhail Piotrovsky,
director of the Hermitage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our relationship with Moma has reached a new stage,'' he said.
``We have little contemporary art, and the museum can't afford to
buy any. So we plan to put the paintings in a special room we are
calling `Moma's Room.' This will be the first of many loans of
modern and contemporary art from Moma and will give the Russian
people an opportunity to see postwar American art.''
</P>
<P>
   The paintings _ de Kooning's ``Tree in Naples'' (1960), Kline's
``White Forms'' (1955) and Motherwell's ``Elegy to the Spanish
Republic, 54'' (1957-1961) _ will be on view from March 23 to Aug.
15.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern and the Hermitage have been working together for more
than 20 years. Since 1977 the Hermitage has lent the Modern
paintings, including some for ``Cezanne: The Late Years,'' ``Henri
Matisse: A Retrospective'' and ``Picasso and Portraiture.''
</P>
<P>
   While the loans have nothing to do with the Modern's plans to
close some of its galleries when its major expansion gets under way
in 2001, Glenn D. Lowry, the director, said the museum would
probably begin circulating parts of its collection both nationally
and internationally. ``We lent works in 1984 when we went through
that expansion,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Piotrovsky said the Hermitage was also hoping to borrow
paintings from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and put together a
special Guggenheim room. The Hermitage is also planning a Rothko
exhibition with help from the National Gallery of Art in
Washington, but that show has not yet found a sponsor.

   The 12-year-old Menil Collection in Houston is experiencing
growing pains as it evolves from a family-run museum headed by its
founder, Dominique de Menil.
</P>
<P>
   Since Mrs. de Menil's death last year board members have been
striving to make the institution more professional. But the process
has brought a shake-up. Two weeks ago the board asked for the
resignation of Miles Glaser, 73, its chief financial officer and a
board member.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt the financial office was not as well organized as it
should be during this time of transition,'' said Louisa Sarofim,
president of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser's lawyer, David Berg, said that his client was
``terminated in an unconscionable way after being at the Menil for
30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Board members say they want a more professional operation. But
Berg said, ``That was not the real motivation. They really want a
new and younger CFO, and they ought to have just said it, rather
than humiliate him in front of the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Winkler, the Menil's director and also a board member,
resigned in protest, as did another board member, Susan O'Conner.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler had run the Menil since 1991 and, like Glaser, has also
left the board of the Menil Foundation, the museum's supporting
institution. Winkler did not return several calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Now trustees are forming a search committee to replace Glaser
and Winkler. ``It's a difficult but exciting moment,'' Ms. Sarofim
said. ``We're trying to make the museum grow up without losing
Dominique de Menil's vision and spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   Another institution in Houston, the Museum of Fine Arts, has
just received a bonanza. Audrey Jones Beck, a lifetime trustee
whose collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings
has been on loan to the museum since 1974, has given it 47
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The gift represents the balance of the John A. and Audrey Jones
Beck Collection, bringing the total number of works given to the
museum to 70. Experts say the collection is worth more than $150
million.
</P>
<P>
   While the paintings have been on the museum's walls for 25
years, said its director, Peter C. Marzio, ``every museum in the
world was after them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on all our audience research this is far and away the
most popular part of the collection,'' he added. Included are ``The
Orange Trees'' (1878) by Caillebotte, ``Bottom of the Ravine''
(circa 1879) by Cezanne and ``Russian Dancers (circa 1899) by
Degas.
</P>

<P>
   After a four-month renovation, the third floor of the Hirshhorn
Museum in Washington has reopened, in time for the museum's 25th
anniversary year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to more wall space, new carpets, platforms for
sculpture and improved lighting, all the art has been reinstalled.
The museum's collection of modern art, which occupies these
galleries, begins with Thomas Eakins and continues through Pop Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the collection has been refined, the level of quality has
gotten higher,'' said Neal Benezra, the assistant director who
oversaw the reinstallation. ``We've tried not to necessarily
present a textbook history but to put together interesting
combinations that question conventional wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Benezra has aimed to give visitors unusual pairings. Wayne
Thiebaud's ``Girls With Ice Cream Cone,'' (1963), a Pop painting of
a girl in a one-piece bathing suit with her legs splayed, now hangs
next to Sigmar Polke's ``Bunnies'' (1966), a deeply ironic painting
based on a photograph of Playboy bunnies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both images of women,'' he said, ``one by a California
Pop artist and one by a German commenting on American Pop and media
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum's second-floor galleries are also being renovated.
More of the Hirshhorn's contemporary collection will be reinstalled
there. They are to open in April.

IRAN'S LOCAL ELECTIONS WILL MEASURE MODERATES' STRENGTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Friday's local elections in Iran are shaping up
as an important test of strength between moderates and the
conservatives who remain the dominant political force.
</P>
<P>
   The elections will be the first local contests since the Islamic
revolution of 1979 ushered in an era in which conservative clerics
have held sway. More than 300,000 candidates are seeking posts,
including women, secularists and others wholly unconnected to the
mullahs who hold most central authority.
</P>
<P>
   A screening panel aligned with the conservatives has
disqualified a number of well-known moderates, a tactic used in
past elections to limit choices. But in a reflection of internal
rivalries, the Interior Ministry has rejected those
disqualifications, leaving open the question of who might be
permitted to hold office.
</P>
<P>
   The outcomes could provide an important gauge of the ability of
President Mohammed Khatami, whose election in 1997 opened a fissure
in the conservatives' grip on power, to maneuver around obstacles
planted by his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The most telling indicator is most likely to be the fate of one
of his closest advisers, Abdollah Nouri. The conservative-dominated
Parliament ousted Nouri as interior minister last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri is seeking election to a local council, and his candidacy
has been the source of the sharpest contention between the
supervisory council, which is aligned with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
the hard-line conservative who is the supreme leader of Iran, and
the Interior Ministry, which reports to Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the supervisory council rejected the candidacy of Nouri
and 50 other prominent moderates because their loyalty to Khamenei
had been questioned or because they were seen as having ``suspect
records from the past,'' according to the official Islamic Republic
New Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry overruled that finding, meaning that the
candidates' names will probably appear on the ballots. But in a
sign of the seriousness of the struggle, the supervisory council
has threatened to nullify the election results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president, his deputy or his interior minister _ none of
them can have a say in the decision of the council,'' said the head
of the panel, Ali Movahedi Savoji.
</P>
<P>
   In telephone interviews from Tehran, Western diplomats and
Iranian political analysts said the lines had been sharply drawn.
``Both sides are digging in their heels,'' one diplomat based in
Tehran said.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear sign of the tensions, a gunman opened fire Wednesday
on the election headquarters of a moderate party in Tehran. No one
was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, authority across Iran, a nation of more than 60
million people, has remained within the closely circumscribed
central hierarchy, which has appointed governors, mayors and
religious leaders. But the election of the local councils, with
200,000 seats, has the potential to begin to shift the balance,
putting at least some power in the hands of vast numbers of
ordinary people. Khatami has promoted the elections as an important
step in developing Iranian democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In percentage terms, the candidates whom the supervisory boards
rejected are a tiny fraction of the candidates. The sheer number of
nonclerics who are seeking office appears to have overwhelmed the
screening panels, who passed on candidates whose campaign posters
leave little doubt as to their secular orientation.
</P>
<P>
   With a brazenness that would have been unimaginable just six
months ago, some men have posed for campaign photographs wearing
neckties and some women have worn lipstick, attire derided by
conservatives as anti-Islamic. That alone is a measure of Khatami's
success in instilling increased tolerance. Even the Freedom
Movement of Iran, banned by the revolutionary leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, has been allowed to field four candidates on a
slate of 11 for the Tehran City Council.

   ASA-AIRTRAN _ Before ASA accepted a buyout offer from longtime

AirTran Airways, SEC filings indicate. An acquisition of
``Asteroid,'' _ a code name for AirTran _ is listed as one of the

filings also show how Delta leaned on ASA to sell out by
threatening to cut the amount of revenue it gets from jointly

   PAYDAY-LOANS _ AUSTIN, Texas _Cash-strapped Texans are paying
rates as high as 800 percent on an annual basis for small consumer

disguised to looking like they are not loans and thus not subject
to Texas' ban on usurious or exorbitant interest rates, according
to the Consumers Union and the AARP. The payday loan practitioners
often use justices of the peace to pursue or threaten to pursue hot
check collection against the borrowers who are victims to begin

It's a rivalry with roots reaching to Jan. 26, 1906, when two
automobile pioneers _ Henry Ford and Louis Chevrolet _ appeared
together on the Daytona Beach shoreline to publicize their new
creations with races. Over the next nine decades, it evolved into a
rich slice of American pop culture. This layout includes a 4 col.

   BBN-BRAVES-JORDAN _ LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ It's a homecoming
of sorts for Braves outfielder Brian Jordan, who once played for
the Falcons and kept his Atlanta home. Jordan showed up at Braves
camp on Wednesday, exchanged greetings with his new teammates, then
went to work. The expectations, already large, grew enormously
because of the loss of Andres Galarraga. (Rogers, Atlanta

VETS DO MORE THAN EVER FOR AILING PETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by LANG partners) 
 
 
By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hunting dogs don't lie around doing nothing. And
Travis certainly fit that profile _ until a little more than a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 9{-year-old Hungarian Vizsla appeared in pain, but his
owners never would have guessed Travis had swallowed a pair of
nylon stockings and that the hosiery had lodged in his intestines.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Goodwein of Van Nuys rushed his dog to a 24-hour emergency
room that Sunday morning, worried, scared and willing to pay
whatever it took to make Travis healthy again.
</P>
<P>
   A few decades ago, Goodwein would have had nowhere to turn.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, serious medical treatment _ and even visits to
the doctor _ were pretty much just for humans. A cat or dog chewed
up in a fight might get a few stitches, but mostly pets simply
lived and then died.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the same miracles of modern medicine that cure humans
of cancer, let them live longer lives with heart or kidney disease,
or at least exit life relatively pain-free are available to pets.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to surveys, more than 10 percent of owners also
have tried massage therapy, and 9 percent have tried
holistic/homeopathic remedies for their dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Pet owners are taking advantage of medical advances to keep
their four-footed friends alive and well, with the average family's
veterinary bills rising from $131 in 1991 to $186 in 1996,
according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency clinics generally are even pricier _ at least 30
percent more expensive than regular vets.
</P>
<P>
   But Goodwein isn't much concerned with cost when it comes to his
pet: ``They'll send me the bill, and whatever it is, I'll pay it.''
</P>
<P>
   He's in good company. According to the American Animal Hospital
Association, 38 percent of pet owners surveyed say they'll even go
into debt for their pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that people care more for their pets now,'' said
Dr. Garth Peterson, who's practiced for 30 years at McClave
Veterinary Hospital in Reseda. ``But they definitely love them, and
they want to do whatever they can for them, including treatments
that just used to be for humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Fluffy and Fido can now benefit from everything from
anxiety-ending tranquilizers to cancer treatments, from new
heartworm remedies to kidney transplants, from a new doggy
Alzheimer's drug to limb-saving orthopedic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   There's even pet CPR.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year and a half, nearly 2,000 pet owners have been
trained in animal first aid, including pet cardiopulmonary and
mouth-to-snout resuscitation, at Encino-based ABC Rescue's classes.
(To sign up for a class, call 818-780-7860.)
</P>
<P>
   The classes work, said ABC owner Craig Jones, who contracts with
the American Red Cross to offer the sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been cases of people bringing their dogs and cats _
as well as lizards and chickens _ back from the brink of death,''
he said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Need a specialist?
</P>
<P>
   Veterinary Referral Associates in Gaithersburg, Md., sometimes
referred to as the Mayo Clinic of veterinary hospitals, is where
more than 5,000 families a year turn when their pets are diagnosed
with life-threatening cancers and other serious ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen doctors _ 13 of them specialists in neurology,
orthopedics, oncology, ophthalmology, radiology, cardiology and
nephrology (kidney disease) _ plus 65 nurses and technicians care
for cats and dogs in the 65-cage hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of care is expensive; a course of radiation treatments
for a pet with cancer can cost $3,500, and chemotherapy can run an
additional $2,000. Sometimes, there are miraculous cures _ dogs
brought in comatose from a brain tumor who scamper home happily
after surgery, cats with kidney disease who leave with a
transplanted organ, perky and purring again.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no guarantees, said VRA administrator Mark Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be just adding six months to an animal's life, and we
tell the owners that up front. But they're willing to spend the
money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's sad is that we have people who come in who can't pay,
and it's really upsetting because they'd really like to save their
animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter pet medical insurance, one of the newer offerings in the
pet care market.
</P>
<P>
   As new ways are found to lengthen pets' lives, some pet owners
are investing in insurance that covers pacemakers and heart
surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, bone replacement surgery and
more.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Stephens is president and founder of Anaheim-based
Veterinary Pet Insurance. Opened in 1982, it's America's oldest and
largest pet insurance company, with more than 850,000 clients and
backed by more than 800 veterinarians.
</P>
<P>
   Premiums run from $99 to $300 or so a year per pet but cover
medical procedures costing thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's saving animals that mean a lot to their owners,''
Stephens said. ``People realize the love that a pet gives and want
to return that with good medical care. There's no reason anymore to
put a pet to sleep when the owner wants to use modern technology to
keep it alive.''
</P>
<P>
   While only 2 percent of 1,252 respondents to an American Animal
Hospital Association 1998 pet owner survey said they have health
insurance for their pet, nearly two-thirds said they would spend
$1,000 or more to save their pet's life, whether it's a family pet
or a show animal. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Last week, show-dog breeder Stephanie Archuleta &UR;  &LR; of Palmdale
took her 3-year-old prize-winning cocker spaniel, Mishka, in to
have his chronically swollen tonsils removed, an operation not
often performed on dogs. The surgery cost $85.
</P>
<P>
   Swollen tonsils don't ``affect Mishka's looks, but if he's not
feeling well, then the dog show is a no-go,'' she said. ``And he's
the love of my life. The money I'd spend on him is limitless. He
deserves that, and the reason is that he gives me 150 percent _ and
why should that not be returned?''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the pet scale, Geraldine Horvill recently
spent $600 for her 6-year-old Pomeranian, Foxy, to have her teeth
cleaned and X-rays taken of a gimpy back leg. Her vet told her
she's looking at a much bigger bill _ perhaps into the thousands of
dollars _ for surgery to correct Foxy's leg problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Reseda widow can ill afford a big vet bill but says she'll
spend whatever it takes to have her companion well again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very expensive, but I figure I have to,'' Horvill said.
``If you don't take care of 'em, you don't have 'em anymore. And
she's my pal.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ER for animals &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The same rule that says you'll have a flat if there's no spare
tire in your trunk seems to decree that a pet will become sickest
after your veterinarian's office closes for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Without 24-hour emergency clinics _ the first one opened 1974 in
New York City _ pets must suffer, and their owners must worry,
until Monday morning when their regular vet's office opens.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time pet owners resort to an emergency clinic,
usually the animals already have been ill for a while, said Dr.
Daniel Grayson, manager of the Animal Critical Care and Veterinary
Specialty Center in Woodland Hills, where Travis was treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, it's 3 in the morning, and it's an emergency,'' Grayson
said. ``Usually when an animal looks sick, it's pretty far along.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the case for Travis.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at the center spent five hours in surgery with Travis,
pumping him full of antibiotics to fight infection. Travis made it
until Wednesday, when he slipped into a coma and died. Through
their grief, his owners are full of praise for the emergency room
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very compassionate _ with both Travis and us,''
Goodwein said, choking back tears. ``They did good work.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing pets die is the hardest thing about being an emergency
vet, said Grayson.
</P>
<P>
   And telling owners the sad news can be even harder, especially
today, when most people think of their pets not as animals, but as
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 5:30 in the morning; his wife had just left him, his
father had died six months ago, his mother was dying of cancer, and
now his dog was sick,'' Grayson said, recalling a young man with a
12-year-old dog who came to his clinic recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left her here, and she seemed fine,'' the vet said. ``All
of a sudden, she absolutely crashed, and we weren't able to bring
her back. That was about the hardest phone call I've ever had to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   The brighter side of medical advancement for pets is that better
veterinary care, better diet and recent medical advances have all
combined to allow pets _ like humans _ to live longer than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   But that also means veterinarians who were trained to give
rabies shots and do minor surgery must learn to recognize
unfamiliar symptoms in geriatric animals, said Dr. Patrick Melese,
director of Veterinary Behavior Consultants in San Diego and one of
the few certified animal behavior specialists in California.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes, heart disease, cancer and cognitive dysfunction
syndrome _ a canine ailment that in many ways mimics Alzheimer's
disease in humans _ all occur in dogs over 8 years old _ an
estimated 6.5 million in America, Melese said. And millions more
aging cats are susceptible to feline leukemia, feline AIDS and
kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back 20 years ago, dogs used to die from being hit by a car.
They didn't live as long, and we didn't know as much,'' he said.
``Today, we can increase animals' life span, and we can keep them
healthier longer. People expect that of us. And they should.''

RIPE FOR THE PAINTING: LANDSCAPES IN 2 BRITISH COLONIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Australia )   By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the early 19th century, Australia and the United
States had a fair amount in common. Although immigration to
Australia started nearly 200 years later than in this country, both
nations began as British colonies. Both had indigenous,
pre-European populations. Almost equal in land mass, the two also
had vast expanses of virgin territory, rife with unexploited
scenery made for the painter's brush.
</P>
<P>
   These similarities _ and many differences _ play into ``New
Worlds From Old: 19th-Century Australian and American Landscapes''
at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, which runs through April 19 here. A
big, solidly packed survey of the century when landscape painting
peaked in both countries, the show was organized by the Wadsworth
Atheneum in Hartford and the National Gallery of Australia in
Canberra. It is not only the first time that Australian and
American landscapes from this era have been shown together, it is
also the first exhibition of such a large group of historical
Australian landscapes outside that country.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, more than 100 works are on view, by artists ranging
from Thomas Cole and Albert Bierstadt to Winslow Homer and William
Merritt Chase on the American front; from John Glover and Eugene
von Guerard to Tom Roberts and Arthur Streeton on the Australian
side. The paintings are grouped in five categories, starting with
wilderness images and ending with the bustle of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking differences between Australia and the
United States is the terrain. Australia is essentially a flat, arid
country with few river systems whose highest peak, Mount Kosciusko,
rises only 7,328 feet. Its flora and fauna are spectacular, but the
landscape is short on set pieces like the Rocky Mountains, Niagara
Falls and Kentucky's Mammoth Cave.
</P>
<P>
   So, in terms of imagery at least, American painters had a big
advantage. It would be hard for an Australian artist to compete
with the immense visual power of Frederic E. Church's ``Niagara
Falls'' (1857), a close-up rendering of the mighty waters that
reflects the energy and optimism of a dynamic country. Or Albert
Bierstadt's ``Mount Corcoran'' (1875-77), a grandiose rendition of
snow-clad peaks in the Sierra Nevada that climb more than 14,000
feet high.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Australians brought talent and vigor to their own subject
matter. The Bierstadt of Australia, von Guerard (1811-1901) _
European-born and German-trained, like Bierstadt _ was attracted to
mountains, too, and painted them with feeling. His ``Mount William
From Mount Dryden, Victoria'' (1857), the highest peak of the
Grampian Ranges, takes a view over a long patch of scrub to show
the mountain almost floating in the distance like a ship, topped by
a crown of clouds. Although less majestic than Bierstadt's Mount
Corcoran, (which is actually a composite of several peaks), it is
still a magnificent specimen of mountainhood, a symbol of power and
potency that made other landscape events look puny.
</P>
<P>
   Australian and American artists did not, of course, escape
European traditions. Their work was fed _ particularly in the case
of Americans, who were more apt to measure their work against Old
World achievements _ by notions of the sublime, regarded as the
revelation of God's presence in the grandeur of nature. But they
were also engaged by the picturesque, or a pleasing irregularity in
the arrangement of forms, a concept derived from the 17th-century
landscape painting of Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the 19th century, however, painting in the two
countries took very different approaches. Whereas Americans once
had feared the wilderness, they began to celebrate its freshness
and novelty, associating it with a political order free from the
immoralities of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Cole's ``Clove, Catskills'' (1826) is a case in point. It
proclaims the glories of a scenic notch between peaks of the
Catskill Mountains, its rocky slopes covered with trees and scrub
in autumnal colors. Storm clouds overhead and bare branches in the
foreground illustrate the power of nature over civilization and the
passage of time, both elements of the sublime. A cliched Indian
stands dramatically poised on a rock in the picture's middle as if
hailing the splendor of the scene. (Since Indians had all but
disappeared from the region by this time, the figure is pure
allegory.) The painting is a celebration of America and its natural
wonders, with a shiver of premonition that they might not last.
</P>
<P>
   A later example of the sublime in painting was Church's
``Natural Bridge, Virginia'' (1852). The bridge, an arch of rock
over Cedar Creek in the Shenandoah Valley, was once owned by Thomas
Jefferson, who bought it from King George III in 1774.
</P>
<P>
   Thought to have been created through a cataclysmic event, the
expanse of rock inspired awe in both settlers and Indians, who
called it the ``Bridge of God.'' In Church's painting, a black
guide at the bottom thought to be one of Jefferson's slaves
explains the bridge to a rapt white tourist.
</P>
<P>
   Australians, whose settlement began as a penal colony in 1788,
held for some time a perception of their land as unwelcoming and
unappealing, even though they appreciated the exoticism of its
flora and fauna. A humorous look at the forbidding country is
Augustus Earle's ``A Bivouac of Travelers in Australia in a Cabbage
Tree Forest, Daybreak'' circa 1838. The scene is the Illawarra
region of New South Wales, densely forested with jungly vegetation.
A group of travelers guided by Aborigines and bivouacked overnight
yawn and stretch before an open fire, inflecting the spooky
landscape with their cheerful human presence.
</P>
<P>
   An important theme in the show is the depiction of native people
by white artists. The treatment could be ethnographic, as in
Glover's lively ``Corrobery of Natives in Mills Plains'' (1832),
which depicts Tasmanian Aborigines dancing around a fire at sunset
under a snaky tree, their movements echoed by the tree's sinuously
curving branches.
</P>
<P>
   Or the approach could be highly romantic, as in Cole's
theatrical extravaganza ``Scene from `The Last of the Mohicans,'
Cora Kneeling at the Feet of Tamenund'' (1827). Depicting an
episode from the 1826 novel by James Fenimore Cooper, the painting
shows a mesa-like outcropping of rock on which a large circle of
Indians surrounds Tamenund, the Delaware chieftain, as he hears a
plea by a mixed-race heroine for her white half-sister's life.
True, it is hard to see the Indians for the spectacular surrounding
peaks, based on Mount Chocorua in New Hampshire's White Mountains
rather than Cooper's setting of Lake George in New York State.
</P>
<P>
   But Cole's concentration on Chocorua, named for a Sokosis Indian
chief who supposedly died on the mountain at the hands of settlers,
forecasts the dispersal of the Indians and the defeat of their
claim to the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   The civilized landscapes of cities and settlements play an
important part in the show, too, starting with the neat, precise
``Houses and Shop of Elijah Boardman (Houses Fronting New Milford
Green)'' (1795-96) by Ralph Earl, one of the first American artists
to paint local scenery. Later, John Mix Stanley's ``Oregon City on
the Willamette River'' (1850-52) paid homage to a prosperous
American lumber town of orderly streets, houses, stores, a sawmill
and a church. In the foreground are two Indians, who turn their
backs on the scene as if to renounce land seized from them.
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, Glover and Knut Bull each painted a placid view of
Hobart, the capital of Tasmania (then called Van Diemen's Land);
Glover in 1832, Bull in 1855. In the foreground of Glover's
``Hobart Town, Taken From the Garden Where I Lived,'' a closeup of
his handsome house and the flowers he grew overlooks a panorama of
the city and its splendid harbor. Bull's ``View of Hobart Town,''
23 years later, from a farm on the outskirts, shows a much more
built-up metropolis, also lying peacefully under a mellow sky.
</P>
<P>
   In the last part of the century, as the United States became
increasingly industrial, and Australia headed toward the 1901
Federation of its separate colonies, landscapes in the two
countries became less empty, more defined by figures, as seen in
the show's final section. But this is the weakest part.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian canvases by Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton,
Frederick McCubbin and Clara Southern (the only woman whose work is
in the exhibit) lack the brio of the more or less familiar American
works by William Merritt Chase, Winslow Homer and Childe Hassam.
</P>
<P>
   We get a much better sense of the two countries' separate
vitalities in the earlier part of the show _ and a welcome look at
an Australia we never saw before.

   NEW YORK _ Hell has no colors in the infernal world of ``Not
About Nightingales.'' In the director Trevor Nunn's enthralling
interpretation of this tormented, long-lost drama by the young
Tennessee Williams, which is only now making its New York debut,
existence has been sapped of all hues but gray, black and white.
</P>
<P>
   The island prison in which this work takes place, as conjured by
the designer Richard Hoover in the intense, vivid production that
opened last night at the Circle in the Square Theater, transmutes
even an American flag, a child's rubber duck and a woman's blouse
that is said to be chartreuse into the same bleak grisaille. Color
is found only in real life, and what's going on in the tomblike,
airless environment of ``Not About Nightingales'' is an antilife,
composed, as one character puts it, of ``memories, shadows,
ghosts.'' It is just one step away from death. It is even closer to
madness.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Lanier Williams III, who would soon adopt the nom de
plume Tennessee, was still waiting for his life to begin when he
wrote this fascinatingly conflicted melodrama at age 27. He was
staying, miserably, with his parents in Depression-era St. Louis,
in the attic room of a house that had become, he wrote, frightening
to him, and he had little hope in his future as a writer.
</P>
<P>
   His journal entries from that time are filled with images of
incarceration and escape, of claustrophobia and birds in flight. It
was in this state of mind that he composed the play that at one
point had the working title ``Hell.'' ``It may be very good or very
bad,'' he wrote. ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, in fact, both. ``Not About Nightingales,'' inspired by
newspaper accounts of atrocities in a Pennsylvania prison, is the
work of a man still unsure of his voice, writing to meet
contemporary tastes in the polemical manner of Clifford Odets. (He
submitted the play without success to Odets' producers at the Group
Theater in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   On one level it closely follows the formulas of gritty,
behind-bars movies like ``The Big House'' (1930), formulas that
were already growing stale. There are definitely moments to wince
over in ``Nightingales''; in the wrong hands it could emerge as a
shrill piece of camp.
</P>
<P>
   Yet just as the prisoners in the play chafe against the
oppression of an inhuman institution, Williams twists and turns
within the self-imposed confines of his generic plot, finally
breaking through it with an agonized lyricism that is all his own.
The young Tom Williams, whose beloved sister recently had been
committed to a mental home, knew what it was like to feel shut out
by life and to fear the loss of reason. A feverish, full-strength
compassion for people in cages makes ``Nightingales'' fly toward a
realm of pain and beauty that is the province of greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Any hint of condescension or academic irony would destroy ``Not
About Nightingales,'' as surely as the unicorn figurine in
Williams' ``Glass Menagerie'' is shattered by a clumsy visitor.
That danger is carefully avoided by Nunn, his actors and his
production team, who match Williams' empathy with unconditional
commitment and passion. This loving, careful and precisely gauged
interpretation nurtures the work into the full-blown life it
deserves. If there were a Lazarus award for acts of resurrection in
theater, this production would surely take the prize of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nightingales'' was first seen at the Royal National Theater in
London, where Nunn is the new artistic director. The rights to the
work had been acquired by the Moving Theater, which was created by
Corin Redgrave, who stars here as the brutal warden, and his sister
Vanessa, who tracked down the manuscript after finding references
to it during research for her role in Williams' ``Orpheus
Descending'' in the 1980s. This staged version is a collaboration
among the National, the Moving Theater and the Alley Theater of
Houston, where I first saw this production last year.
</P>
<P>
   It was a revelation then, but in the succeeding months the show
has taken on an even greater fluidity and dramatic momentum. Any
stiffness or self-consciousness within the cast, a mixture of
American and British performers, has been shed.
</P>
<P>
   The actors make no wry apologies for characters who are, at
least in their outlines, potboiler cliches. Even when the play
drifts into the threadbare conventions of melodrama, and it does
again and again, you are never tempted to snicker. The members of
the ensemble here seem to believe so utterly in what they're doing
that you have no choice but to go along with them.
</P>
<P>
   As in so many prison melodramas, a hunger strike is the pivot of
the plot, initiated here in response to an unvarying,
ptomaine-inducing diet of spaghetti and meatballs. It is carried
out by the usual lineup of cellblock archetypes, overseen by
Redgrave's despotic warden.
</P>
<P>
   There's Butch O'Fallon (James Black), the tough, domineering
self-appointed leader of the strike; his strapping, less dynamic
lieutenant, Joe (J.P. Linton), and the cock-sure,
soon-to-be-crushed new boy, nicknamed Swifty (Mark Dexter). There
are also the good-hearted Ollie (Dion Graham), sent to prison for
stealing food to feed his family, and the sensitive and effeminate
inmate, inevitably named the Queen (Jude Akuwudike), who delivers
the quintessentially Williams declaration that ``all my life I've
been persecuted by people because I'm refined.''
</P>
<P>
   Before these disparate men looms, in addition to the habitual
beatings administered by the guards, the threat of consignment to
``Klondike,'' a boiler room lined with steam radiators. (In the
real-life events that inspired ``Nightingales,'' four men were
cooked to death in such a chamber.) Klondike is the ultimate
metaphor in the play's chain of images of suffocation, entombment
and isolation, and the climate of fear it engenders is what gives
the play its toxic life's blood.
</P>
<P>
   In this increasingly claustrophobic world of deprivation, where
the music of a passing cruise ship named the Lorelei drifts
sirenlike through the prison windows, a taunting embodiment of
freedom, no one is sure of his own senses anymore. The specter of
Sailor Jack (Matthew Floyd Miller), who already has gone
``stir-bugs'' when the play begins, hovers as an omen of an
all-too-possible destiny for everyone in the play.
</P>
<P>
   Another convict, Jim Allison (the excellent Finbar Lynch), a
self-taught intellectual and the warden's flunky, finds his hands
shaking from repression. The warden's pretty, plucky young
secretary, Eva Crane (Sherri Parker Lee), will be driven to attempt
suicide before the evening is over. Even the lecherous, sadistic
warden, Boss Whelan ( Redgrave), has a moment in which he
contemplates the degree to which his mind has been poisoned by his
profession.
</P>
<P>
   This inescapable, haunted anxiety is what makes ``Nightingales''
more than a lurid pulp tale on the one hand or a rancorous soapbox
oration on the other. And the actors here unfailingly locate the
fracturing crack in their characters' plaster personas. This is by
no means an imposition but an elucidation of what is indeed in
Williams' script.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike similar heroines of the same era, Eva, played with
refreshing straightforwardness by Ms. Crane, is able to admit her
fascination as well as her repulsion for the predatory Whalen,
anticipating the sexual ambivalence of the Blanches and Almas to
come in the Williams canon. Black gives convincing life to the
poetic longings within Butch, embodied by the dream apparition of
his dance hall sweetheart (Sandra Seares Dickinson), as well as his
self-admiring machismo.
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave and Lynch, as the respective embodiments of the play's
social evils and its social conscience, are outstanding. Redgrave
tempers Whalen's bilious cruelty and sinister, good-old-boy glee
with a sweaty, humanizing anxiety. Lynch infuses every gesture with
a sense of suppressed, self-cannibalizing energy that gives a
startling credibility to even his baldest thematic speeches. If you
want to grasp the soul of the play, you need only focus on Lynch's
sharp, restless eyes, which bespeak an intelligence that is as much
a curse as a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   I have never known the awkward theatrical space that is Circle
in the Square to be used as effectively as it is here, with the
prisoners marching in lock step through the aisles and the guards
suddenly materializing at your side. Nunn's staging extends the
prison's boundaries to embrace the audience, further inhibiting any
safe sense of a spectator's distance.
</P>
<P>
   You're stirred, against your will, when Graham rises to his feet
to lead the prisoners in a hymn of protest at meal time. When a
searchlight interrupts a sexual tryst between Jim and Eva, you
somehow feel personally violated.
</P>
<P>
   Rendering the play visually in shades of black and white is a
masterstroke, carried out with devious subtlety not only in
Hoover's single, ingeniously versatile set but in Karyl Newman's
period costumes and Chris Parry's crepuscular lighting, in which
even the shadows have oppressive substance. The color scheme and
the use of projected scene-setting supertitles bring to mind old
movies and newspaper photographs, an acknowledgment of the play's
status as artifact.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the evening proceeds, it seems to overflow with colors
set pulsingly in relief by the stark frame of its setting.
Williams' palette was never monochrome. The emotions, both savage
and painfully delicate, that saturate his work are arguably more
rich and varied in tone than those of any American dramatist.
</P>
<P>
   The colors are in the voices of Williams' entrapped
nightingales, which are what these characters are despite the
demurral of the title. They are colors that refuse to fade when the
play is plunged into its concluding darkness.

 &HT;    WOMEN'S GROUPS CALL RAPE CHARGE 'CREDIBLE,' 'DEVASTATING'
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Feminists said Thursday that although a rape charge
leveled at President Clinton by Juanita Broaddrick could be
impossible to prove 21 years later, they nevertheless found it to
be ``credible'' and ``devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I genuinely believe she didn't want to come forward, and I
understand why she wouldn't, 21 years ago, want to bring this story
forward,'' said Patricia Ireland, president of the National
Organization for Women.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the sometimes tearful 56-year-old Broaddrick tell
NBC's ``Dateline'' of the alleged assault in a Little Rock, Ark.,
hotel, Ireland said, ``The story was devastating because she
doesn't have an apparent political motivation and she doesn't seem
to be in it for the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ireland's organization, which has been skeptical of women in the
past who have made sexual allegations against Clinton, moved
quickly to warn the White House and its supporters ``not to launch
a broadside'' against Broaddrick, an Arkansas nursing home
executive.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ireland joined other feminists in concluding that no
action should be taken in the matter. ``It is almost inconceivable
that the charges could be proven, or defended against, this many
years later,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland also said that she would not demand an explanation from
Clinton, who has issued a statement rejecting the charges through
his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A denial from Bill Clinton or anyone speaking on his behalf
has historically been proven not to be worth the air that it takes
to say them or the paper it takes to write them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Broaddrick also won verbal support from the group 9to5, the
National Association of Working Women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many things about her that were very credible,
particularly her reason for not coming forward earlier,'' said
Ellen Bravo, co-director of the Milwaukee-based group. ``She's
certainly accurate that most people at that time would not have
believed her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is undeniably true that unless you're a saint or have a
witness or hard evidence, coming forward can be humiliating,
expensive and demeaning,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   That view was echoed by the executive director of the District
of Columbia Rape Crisis Center, who said she found Broaddrick's
story very familiar. ``What she describes and how she responded is
fairly typical of people who are raped,'' Denise Snyder said. ``I
was talking to a person who was assaulted a week ago, and she was
raising virtually the same fears and concerns (about going to the
police). She was concerned about her own life and reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder added that the problem is worse if the alleged attacker
is prominent: ``Every time a person brings a charge against a man
of prestige, she ends up getting ground in the mill.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ireland and Bravo urged no action in the Clinton case,
some more conservative groups are unwilling to drop the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't say it's 21 years and it doesn't matter,'' said
Barbara Ledeen, executive director of the Independent Women's
Forum. ``They sure cared when it was (Sen. Bob) Packwood,'' a
Republican who was forced to resign after being accused of unwanted
sexual advances on women.
</P>
<P>
   Ledeen called on Clinton to answer the charges directly. ``He,
the president, being accused of rape, says 'Go talk to my lawyer,'
`` she said. ``A normal man being accused of such a thing would
rise up on his hind legs and say 'How dare you?' ``
</P>
<P>
   She called on the White House to release Clinton's calendar from
April 1978, when the incident allegedly occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the calendar, White House spokesman Jim Kennedy
referred a reporter to the written statement released Friday: ``Any
allegation that the President assaulted Ms. Broaddrick more than 20
years ago is absolutely false. Beyond that, we are not going to
comment.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   As much as 10 inches of snow had fallen by early Thursday
afternoon across eastern Long Island as a formidable but sluggish
low-pressure system swirled impressively off the Northeast coast.
Friday, as the system heads slowly toward Nova Scotia, Atlantic
moisture will wrap inland around the low, paving the way for light
to moderate snows across Maine. Broken areas of snow will develop
as far south as Rhode Island, but winds blowing from the northwest
will dry on descent toward the coast, limiting the coverage and
intensity of snow. Mild weather will prevail over much of the rest
of the eastern third of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, humidity rose dramatically across east Texas as
winds from the south imported Gulf moisture. On Friday, Gulf
moisture will stream farther northward ahead of a cold front
approaching from the Rockies, setting the stage for showers and
thunderstorms to develop early in the day across parts of eastern
Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri. Showers and storms spread
eastward during the day. Farther south across Texas, warm air 5,000
feet above the ground will act like a lid to limit thunderstorms.
However, if the lid is eroded during the day, heavier thunderstorms
could erupt over northern and central Texas Friday afternoon and
night. A few of these storms could approach severe levels.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rain will arrive later in the day at the Pacific
Northwest coast as yet another Pacific disturbance takes aim on the
region. Rain and wind will intensify Friday night, with more snow
slated for the Cascades above 4,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Heavy Snow &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy snow fell over eastern Long Island, Cape Cod and interior
southeast Massachusetts Thursday while air temperatures hovered in
the lower 30s. Typically, the greatest snowfalls occur with surface
air temperatures near 32 degrees. The underlying principle that
supports this observation is that rates of evaporation of water are
determined by temperature; the higher the temperature, the faster
the evaporation rate. Thus, as surface air temperatures rise toward
32 degrees, the amount of potential moisture evaporated into the
air increases, raising the likelihood of heavier snow.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With co-owner Edward DeBartolo Jr. banished from
a managerial role in the San Francisco 49ers, the team's sidelined
plan for a new stadium may get new life.
</P>
<P>
   Denise DeBartolo York consolidated her control over the 49ers
Wednesday, putting her husband in charge of the team and moving to
end her brother's access to club cash to pay his personal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   York issued the orders to all 49ers personnel after she
consulted with National Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue
and following clashes within the organization over demands by
DeBartolo to pay his bills, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The development is the strongest sign yet that DeBartolo's
banishment from managerial involvement in the NFL is not likely to
end soon, and could be permanent.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic development may mean good news for the 49ers'
proposal to build a new stadium at Candlestick Point with an
adjoining retail center, at a cost of $525 million. Sources said
the management shakeup clarifies an ambiguous ownership situation
and puts control in the hands of York, a wealthy, credit-worthy
owner.
</P>
<P>
   York is chairwoman and chief executive of the privately held
Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. of Youngstown, Ohio, the company that
owns the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denise DeBartolo York taking control of the team is a good
thing as far as the stadium goes,'' said company spokesman Sam
Singer, ``because lenders or bank officials can now look to one
entity, one person, and they have an individual to deal with,
rather than two different parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Her brother no longer may be given club funds or information
about club operations without approval, according to a memo _
obtained by the San Francisco Examiner _ that was issued to club
personnel Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources familiar with DeBartolo Corp. finances and
York's decisions, DeBartolo incurred a $91 million debt to the
Youngstown corporation as a result of ``lifestyle choices and
investments'' he purportedly made using advances and loans obtained
over more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put it mildly,'' one source said, ``Eddie lives large.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, DeBartolo and the 49ers' chief financial
officer, Bill Duffy, got into a heated dispute when DeBartolo
demanded salary increases and special playoff-appearance bonuses
for his daughters, Lisa and Nikki, both of whom work for a
charitable arm of the club, the 49ers Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa DeBartolo confirmed Wednesday that salaries for her sister
and herself had been a contentious issue in the organization.
Following a hastily called meeting Wednesday at club headquarters
in Santa Clara, she said, in reference to her sister and herself:
``We were the only ones in the building not to get a raise last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa DeBartolo said her father had seen his sister's memo, but
she declined to comment on his reaction to it. Neither DeBartolo
nor Duffy returned telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo, 52, co-owns the corporation with York, but holds no
office in it. He is under suspension by the National Football
League for his involvement in a federal gambling and bribery case.
According to the league, the suspension is likely to continue
through the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   In October, DeBartolo pleaded guilty to a felony _ failure to
report an alleged extortion attempt _ in connection with the
federal government's investigation and prosecution of former
Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards. He is expected to testify in the case
this year.
</P>
<P>
   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello declined to comment on York's move,
saying only, ``It's club business.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain York's dramatic steps, Singer said: ``There
have been a series of practices, financial and otherwise, that
Eddie has carried out in the past that are going to be different
under the stewardship of Denise DeBartolo York.''
</P>
<P>
   York gave her husband, John York, and an aide, Keith Lenhart,
oversight responsibility for the team. John York is a DeBartolo
Corp. senior vice president and member of the board of directors.
Lenhart is the corprate controller. Both men will become vice
presidents of the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Denise York also named former 49ers head coach Bill Walsh as
team vice president and general manager, giving him day-to-day
command of the team. In recent weeks, Walsh served the organization
as an informal adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said Wednesday that he anticipated ``no difference''
between DeBartolo and York in club operations or progress on
building a new stadium at Candlestick Point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stadium-wise, John York and Denise are doing the same kinds of
things I think Eddie DeBartolo would be doing ... There are some
people working on line working on it now,'' Walsh said.

HISTORY RECONSTRUCTED AND SPELLED BACKWARD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Argentina, Mexico)   By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ American photographers generally have not had much
truck with myth. Myth has never been the camera's primary subject
anyway, and this country has no long and indelible tradition that
would readily lend itself to philosophical or speculative inquiry
under the severe scrutiny of the lens. Native Americans have
ancient myths; immigrants (the rest of America) have less to
sustain and identify us.
</P>
<P>
   Mesoamerica is different. There, the pre-Hispanic myths are
present and visible on monuments and even on live faces that
resemble Mayan carvings. Long-gone traditions, even gods, are
incorporated into Catholicism in smaller towns and continue to be
significant for many who wish to recapture an older cultural
identity. Recent photography takes note. Gerardo Suter is a prime
example.
</P>
<P>
   An important photographer in Mexico, Suter has shown often in
Mexico City and elsewhere in Latin America since the end of the
1970s but never before in a one-person show in New York. Now there
are two exhibitions of his work in town, one of them split between
two locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gerardo Suter: Labyrinth of Memory,'' a traveling show, is the
two-part exhibition: 36 black-and-white photographs and a small
video projection at the Americas Society through March 21 and two
large installations at the Sculpture Center through March 20. Mary
Schneider Enriquez is the curator of the show, which was organized
by the Americas Society, as well as author of an essay in the
bilingual catalog that accompanies it.
</P>
<P>
   Throckmorton Fine Art is showing another 12 photographs in
``Gerardo Suter: New Territory'' through March 27.
</P>
<P>
   Suter, born in Argentina, moved to Mexico in 1970, and his work
is virtually embroiled in the history and myths of ancient Mexico.
His first series of photographs, ``El Archivo Fotografico del
Profesor Retus (The Photographic Archive of Professor Retus),''
shown in 1986 and 1987, announced that he was constructing a
history. ``Constructing'' is an important word here. Since the
1960s, Mexican photography had been almost exclusively
``straight,'' unmanipulated, documentary or photojournalistic
photography, and Suter led a new movement that was only grudgingly
accepted at first but is now a strong component of contemporary
work.
</P>
<P>
   Retus was a fiction whose name was Suter spelled backward, and
the archive a sequence of Suter's own photographs of details of
pre-Columbian monuments, doctored in the darkroom to look suitably
distressed and old. They were about the search for pre-Hispanic
history on two levels: the mystery and power of a culture that,
though it has been destroyed, is ever present, and the means by
which evaluation of that culture shifted from the European sense
that it was merely heathen to the level of study, collecting and
tourist attraction. That shift was accomplished partly through
19th-century archeology and photography, partly perhaps through the
romance of everything old, which Suter's treated photographs
craftily mimicked.
</P>
<P>
   His subsequent photographs have centered on naked human bodies
playing out explicit or implicit myths, metaphors or rituals with
masks and props, gestures or actions. He reimagines figures like
Tlaloc, god of rain and earth, as a nude man in a mask with an
enormous eye and an enormous fang, and Coatlicue, that fearsome
deity, as a woman holding before her face an image of the
skull-like head of the goddess who gave birth to the war god even
after she was beheaded by her enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures inspired by ancient codices are of hands with spikes
attached to the fingers, heads with mouths forced open by wooden
contraptions, bound hands in prayerful attitudes. The references
become increasingly arcane, beyond the knowledge of experts but not
beyond the imagination and dreams of others, a kind of invented set
of Jungian archetypes.
</P>
<P>
   The subject is always presented centrally, up close, with dark,
heavy shadows and theatrical lighting _ an iconic, emblematic
rendering. At Throckmorton, some of the figures are blurred and
elongated, gesturing without the aid of props, perhaps engaged in
ritual or transformation. This emphasis on heraldic, iconic
compositions, on symmetry, confrontation, proximity and nonspecific
but clearly mythical references seems peculiarly Latin American, as
in the work of Luis Gonzalez Palma and Mario Cravo Neto. Suter's
photography is bold, cold, wrapped in silence and expectation,
charged with menace, mystery, sensuality. In large doses, it can
be, for someone who is not fully enmeshed in a culture of myth, a
bit overbearing.
</P>
<P>
   And North American history has not generated such a culture,
not, at least, one suitable to photography. The Revolution and the
Civil War, both fact and myth, were tackled by painters long after
the event, but costume dramas dissolve into silliness in
photographs and no one has found a universal symbolic form to stand
for those wars. The myth of the western frontier is something of an
exception, recurring often in action and image and metaphor, in
paintings, novels, hundreds of movies, and in landscape photographs
by Ansel Adams, photographic advertisements featuring the Marlboro
Man and photographs by the likes of Lewis Baltz and Robert Adams
that critique the loss of purity in the fabled lands.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek myths and the Bible, the great inheritance of
Europeans and Caucasians, have been more easily accommodated by
literature, drama and film than by the workaday camera. Moses is
simply not a photographic subject, even in symbolic guise. In the
1930s, George Platt Lynes staged a few tableaux based on Greek
myths; Sophocles would have shuddered. But more recently, myth has
begun to enter the photographic realm in the ethnic search for
roots and effort at self definition, as in occasional photographs
by Carrie Mae Weems and Albert Chong.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years Suter has been moving away from even that
kind of myth and away from photography into the territory of mixed
media and installation where so many photographic artists are
putting down stakes. Some of his largest images are printed on
transparent acetate. They cannot be framed, they cannot even be
seen without a light behind them and must be suspended from the
ceiling: photographs that need light to feed them.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he combines them with video or works with video alone,
and most recently he has ventured into the ephemeral realm of the
Internet. A small video at the Americas Society, ``Latido (Beat),''
accompanied by a sound rather like a beating heart, tautly combines
hope and fear. On a monitor, a rough stretch of dirt seems to
breathe in and out. It is quickly revealed to be a man's
earth-covered torso as he wipes the dirt off his skin, becomes
living and human, then is covered once more, only to unearth
himself, only to be covered again, unendingly.
</P>
<P>
   This video is one part of a three-part installation, the largest
element of which is at the Sculpture Center. ``Vientre (Womb)'' is
a huge seven-section image on acetate of a naked woman squatting in
the birth position with her arms outstretched and her mouth open in
a cry. A path of sand with footprints leads toward her groin, while
on a monitor a pair of feet repeatedly steps into footprints in
sand. This refers to an old manuscript that tells of a sacred cave,
the birthplace of a group of indigenous Mexican peoples.
</P>
<P>
   The other installation at the Sculpture Center, ``Stratus I,''
is a video of a naked, kneeling man with hands half clenched up
near his shoulders, projected on both sides of a corner of a
darkened room above a lighted mound of sand. He leans down to scoop
up sand, his hands coming off the wall onto the lighted area, lifts
his hands again and lets the sand sift back out of them.
</P>
<P>
   This is at first oddly moving, with its implications of time and
ritual, but as it repeats over and over and over with only the most
minuscule variations, possibly to indicate hopelessness, it verges
on something worse in this context: boredom.
</P>
<P>
   In an intelligently argued essay in the catalog, a Mexican
critic, Olivier Debroise, offers the theory, perhaps a little
strained but grandly provocative, that Suter not only skeptically
and ironically examines the visual representation of history but
also the very possibilities of visual media in general.
</P>
<P>
   In light of this idea, Suter could be viewed as an artist who
uses cultural myths to question both the way these myths have been
represented and the myths attached to representation itself. This
is a fashionable path to follow and not immediately evident in many
of the photographs at hand; Debroise refers to a couple of
installations that are not exhibited.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the major myth that photographers are dealing with these
days is the discredited one that photographs convey reality and
truth, and it just may be that art criticism's current major myth,
whether right or wrong, is that photographers are more heavily
invested in questioning representation than they are in their
subjects themselves.

<P>
   LVIV, Ukraine _ The citizens of this graceful but impoverished
city have a message for the West: Hand over your money, or we'll
shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Just a decade ago, when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union,
Lviv was a prime supplier of Moscow's tanks, bombsights and
military electronics. When the Soviet Union vanished, so did Lviv's
weapons orders, scores of thousands of factory jobs _ and then, bit
by bit, the city's hope for a capitalist future.
</P>
<P>
   The question now, says its young mayor, Vasyl Kuybida, is
whether the capitalists want to do anything about it. And what Lviv
will do if the West doesn't help out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either we find international sources to finance the conversion
of these factories'' to nonmilitary uses, Kuybida said in an
interview this month, ``or we'll be forced to return to arms
production on the level of France, Germany, Great Britain and so
on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not moral standards just for us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether bluff or threat, that captures a gnawing worry among
some political leaders and intellectuals here that Ukraine's best
opportunity to fix itself firmly in Europe _ maybe its last for a
long time _ is in danger of slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   The trappings of a Western democracy are all there. Ukraine can
hold free elections with the best of them, and its leaders say they
are committed to laissez-faire capitalism and enlightened
self-rule. But outsiders say the bureaucracy still shows its Soviet
genealogy. Communist legislators block the most crucial reforms.
The basket-case economy remains lashed to its Russian past _ and
the longer it stays there, the tighter the bind becomes.
</P>
<P>
   How tight could be decided as soon as October, when Ukraine will
hold its third presidential election since independence in 1991.
With eight months to go, the pro-European incumbent, Leonid Kuchma,
is in trouble, unable so far to raise living standards and
unwilling, by some accounts, to uproot endemic official corruption.
</P>
<P>
   More telling, he has largely failed to overhaul Ukraine's
Soviet-era economy. Major industries remain under state control and
land has still to be privatized. Few companies have looked beyond
Moscow either for raw materials or for customers _ 60 percent have
business ties with Russian firms _ and so Russia's crash last
August stopped Ukraine's economy cold. In fact, it may add another
two years of recession to the three Ukraine already has endured.
</P>
<P>
   For a nation still spending comparatively huge sums to address
the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster almost 13 years
ago, the economic problems are backbreaking. Fiscal analysts say
the country will be hard pressed to pay its foreign debt this year.
</P>
<P>
   As in Russia, the government has deferred some pensions and
salaries to workers at state-owned industries. The citizens have
usually been stoic, but not always: recently, one unpaid coal miner
died when he set himself afire in protest. A half-dozen other
miners slit their wrists, but survived.
</P>
<P>
   The fault is not all Kuchma's. Ukraine's 450-member Parliament,
a fistfight-prone body with a corruption problem, is swayed by
current and former Communists who have blocked land privatization
and an overhaul of the crippling tax system. But the president is
getting the blame. And were the election held tomorrow, many
analysts say, voters might dump him for a candidate from the
socialist and Communist left.
</P>
<P>
   A leading contender, they say, would be Oleksandr Moroz, a
Socialist Party leader seen by many as the least radical of the
leftist candidates.
</P>
<P>
   If voters feel the same this fall, it could change the course of
Ukraine's young democracy. Most leftists favor still closer
political and economic ties with Russia. And more are warming to
the notion that Ukraine should join an emerging alliance between
Russia and their mutual neighbor Belarus, where power is in the
hands of an eccentric Soviet-style dictator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on whether the West has any strategy,'' said
Vira Manivska, who heads the International Center for Policy
Studies, a Kiev group dedicated to improving Ukrainian governance.
``If things go their own way here, I don't think we have many
chances of being independent of Russia. The only thing going for us
is that Russia doesn't have any strategy, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine has done some things right. Its central bank handled the
August crash far more deftly than Russia did, with the result that
its banking system has survived largely intact and its creditors
are mostly satisfied. The government is moving to reduce taxes, a
big barrier to foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   (After threatening to halve its aid because of Ukraine's lack of
progress toward economic reform, the United States said Friday that
it is releasing $195 million in assistance this year, in part
because the business climate has improved.)
</P>
<P>
   The country also boasts something no other former Soviet state
has: a second freely elected president. If it is poor, Ukraine is
also stable, democratic and _ for the moment, at least _ insistent
on remaining sovereign.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine's problems cannot be ignored. Its western neighbors _
Poland, Hungary and other former Soviet satellites _ see it as the
main buffer between them and an increasingly wobbly, untrustworthy
Russia. Potentially, it is a formidable ally or rival: Ukraine is
far larger in area than Poland and Hungary combined, its military
is nearly as big as theirs, and with 50 million people, it is just
as populous.
</P>
<P>
   But the superlatives end at economics. The average Ukrainian
earns $40 a month; a comparable Hungarian makes eight times as
much. Foreign investors have sunk $2.7 billion into Ukraine during
eight years of independence; in Poland, they invested three times
that last year alone. In dollar terms, the average Pole produced
four times as much as an average Ukrainian last year.
</P>
<P>
   Poland, Hungary and the nearby Czech Republic are joining NATO
in March and, almost certainly, farther down the road, the European
Union. Ukraine is not even on the waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``To adapt our military system to NATO requirements, we'd have
to spend $1.7 billion a year, maybe more. You have to understand
that the actual budget for all Ukraine isn't more than $8
billion,'' said Oleksandr Razumkov, the deputy secretary of
Ukraine's national security and defense council and the country's
liaison to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   As for membership in the European Union, ``It's not realistic
for 10 or 15 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How adjacent nations could take such divergent courses is as
much a matter of mentality as geography. Poland had enjoyed
centuries of independence in the course of its history, well before
it became a Soviet satellite after World War II. When the Soviet
empire crumbled, Poles knew precisely what they wanted next.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine, on the other hand, did not exist in its current borders
until Stalin cut an ill-fated land-for-peace deal with Hitler in
1939. For centuries before that, it was split among empires _ the
eastern half ruled by Russia's czars, the western by the Poles and
the Austrians.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Ukraine, with the capital, Kiev, and most of the people,
took on a Eurasian cast and, thanks to the Soviet Union, an
assemblage of smoky industries. The western part became decidedly
European and poor. Even now, the two halves often seem to share
little beside a language.
</P>
<P>
   That Ukrainians wanted their freedom was a given. But deciding
what to do with it has been a problem _ all the more because their
only practice in governing came at the feet of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``For eight years, this country has been unable to define its
orientation. It can't last forever,'' said Taras Steckiw, a member
of Parliament from Lviv and a leader in the centrist People's
Democratic Party. ``Either we'll be an element of a Slavic union,
or we're the forepost of Western civilization. Or we're the
bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Few places feel the competing East-West tugs more acutely than
Lviv, a museum-piece city of 850,000 set on the Ukrainian
flatlands, just 40 miles from Poland. Ukrainian here is dappled
with Polish suffixes and inflections, and the town with Gothic
cathedrals, Renaissance squares and Austrian coffeehouses (the
Austrians, who ruled here until 1918, called it Lemberg).
</P>
<P>
   Lviv produced Ukraine's first independence movement, in 1848,
and its first independent state _ Ruthenia, born at the end of
World War I and subdued by Poland a few days later. Lviv spawned
most of Ukraine's anti-Communist dissidents, its first
anti-Communist protest, and its first modern political party. No
Ukrainian city is more European or more democratic.
</P>
<P>
   And few are poorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we survive?'' asked Natasha Cedovina, a young widow
with a daughter. ``There's nothing for gas; nothing for
electricity. It's a circle without end.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cedovina was eyeing the prices in a battered one-room shop
just outside Lviv, in the village of Zhorkva. Beneath a lithograph
of the Virgin Mary, the store's four shelves were heavy with
bottles of Slava vodka, coffee, chocolate bars, jars of pickled
pigs' feet and cucumbers, most well beyond her budget.
</P>
<P>
   The state gives her a monthly window's pension and allowance for
her child that comes to $11.22. She has no job; the glass factory
where she once worked shut down after Ukraine's independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which plant is operating? No plant is operating,'' she said.
``Ask us which plant hasn't closed.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The six or seven other women in the shop nodded agreement and
began to chime in. ``My child has diabetes. There's no money for
medicine,'' one complained. The eldest, a stout, red-faced woman
missing several teeth, was plaintive. ``Can you help me get my
pension?'' she asked. ``Six months I'm without a pension.''
</P>
<P>
   The story in Lviv proper is much the same. By conservative
estimate, 135,000 workers lost their jobs when the city's
military-oriented plants became idle. Kuybida says close to a third
of all workers are unemployed, initially because the break with the
Soviet Union severed business ties, but now because the factories
have been unable to adjust to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   In no small part, that is Kiev's fault.
</P>
<P>
   Ukrainian experts say the government has been hard put to change
its ways because it remains saddled with Soviet-era bureaucrats and
Soviet ways. And that reflects the lineage of virtually all senior
officials: from Kuchma on down, Ukraine is run largely by men from
the Russified East.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve million of Ukraine's citizens _ nearly a quarter _ are
ethnic Russian, and most live in the east. During the Soviet era,
some came to work in heavy industry; many others headed south to
Ukraine for retirement, much as Americans flock to Florida. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of these Russians are at best indifferent to integration
with the West. In fact, while it is hard to find anyone in Lviv who
is not ardently pro-Western Europe and anti-Communist, no more than
one in five Ukrainians say in polls that they favor turning to the
West. More than that _ a third, in one poll _ favor closer ties
with former Soviet states or outright reunification with Russia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The same polls show that the strongest support for a
Western-oriented Ukraine lies among young people, regardless of
where they live. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ukraine doesn't have a generation yet,'' said Bohdan
Kravchenko, a former government official who founded and heads a
public-administration training institute. ``The entrepreneurial
class is by and large extremely young.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What troubles officials like Kuybida is whether Ukraine has a
generation's time to waste. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of the Soviet Union, he said, ``Market forces
won. But it just can't happen that people go to bed Communist and
get up the next morning with democratic ideas. If people see for
seven years that they have no job, no reform, no expectations for
the future, then they'll start thinking that they made a mistake.''

BUSH TO DECIDE ON FIRST STAGE OF PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN TWO WEEKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, who has enjoyed lavish
attention from around the country, said Thursday he will announce
in the next two weeks whether he is taking the first formal step to
a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But an aide said Bush will spend the summer traveling the
country after the Texas Legislature ends in May and will not make a
final decision about running for president until late summer or
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also complained about the ``garbage'' rumors circulating
about his wild past and urged Texas reporters not to ``fall prey to
the Washington, D.C. game'' of spreading personal rumors about
politicians' pasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two weeks I'll make an announcement,'' Bush told reporters.
``I've made up my mind to answer the question yes, no or maybe.``
</P>
<P>
   But Bush signaled his intentions when asked whether the string
of advisers and politicians from other states who have visited him
at the Governor's Mansion would be upset if he decided not to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the answer would have been no, people would understand,``
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said if Bush, as expected,
announces the formation of an exploratory committee it will just be
the first stage of making up his mind on whether to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect he will make a final decision on seeking the
presidency until late summer or early fall,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up an exploratory committee allows a potential
presidential candidate to raise money without formally entering the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said that after the legislative session ends in May and
the 20-day period for the governor to sign or veto bills passes,
then Bush would start traveling the nation to test the presidential
waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be his opportunity for first-hand exploration of
whether he wants to run,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been the toast of GOP circles in the nation's capital
whether he is there _ as he was Tuesday when a dozen of his
colleagues said they backed a Bush campaign _ or not, such as his
almost daily receptions of visitors and letters from state
lawmakers and members of Congress from all over the country urge
him to run.
</P>
<P>
   But with the adulation comes what Bush said might keep him out
of the race _ ``the meat grinder of national politics.'' Potential
opponents have begun to take their shots, and, with the impeachment
of President Clinton over, national political talk shows are
beginning to question whether Bush has a troubled past.
</P>
<P>
   Bush Thursday called such stories ``garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the serious press helps flush the garbage out of the
system,'' Bush said. ``The press ought to take a deep breath before
they try to diminish anybody's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, as he has said before, dismissed as irrelevant any stories
about what he has called his ``young and irresponsible'' years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What matters is: Did you grow up? When you put your hand on
the Bible did you swear to uphold the dignity of the office to
which you were elected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A New Hampshire television reporter last month asked Bush if he
had ever used marijuana or cocaine. The governor responded with his
standard refusal to answer questions about his ``youthful''
indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's answer quickly became fodder for commentators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say I found his answer about whether he had used
marijuana and cocaine interesting,'' Newsweek's Eleanor Clift said
on ``The McLaughlin Group'' recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have a gift for redefining the life cycle.
Childhood now goes through probably the early 30s.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, MSNBC gossip columnist Jeannette Walls heightened the
rumor mill with a story that a source close to Bush said he would
not run for president because ``he has a past ... If he declares
his candidacy, that jerk from Hustler is going to unearth all the
dirt on him.'' Hustler publisher Larry Flynt pursued stories of
congressmen's marital infidelities during Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gossip and innuendo is never pleasant. Unfortunately, it's a
fact of political life. We try to ignore it, because we know it is
not true,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's long and tentative presidential prospecting harkens back
to the non-campaigns of Ronald Reagan and former New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1975 Reagan ended what Newsweek called ``a year's
suspenseless deliberation'' by announcing he would challenge
President Gerald Ford for the GOP presidential nomination. Reagan
lost, but it set the stage for his 1980 presidential victory.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Cuomo considered a presidential run in 1991 by
announcing he was ``without any plans to make plans.'' Draft
committees formed. Political advisors visited him in Albany. ``You
don't get drafted for the presidency,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, the perceived front-runner for the Democratic nomination,
dropped out of the race. Three years later, he lost his bid for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The hallmark of Bush's deliberations has been keeping his
promise to stay in Texas while the Legislature is in session,
except for a few trips such as this week's governors conference in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, who jumped right into a presidential race, only
to be among the first to drop out in 1996, predicted to reporters
that Bush's front-runner status was secure.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the governor needed to decide to run before taking the
lead, Gramm replied: ``Nah. Does he look undecided to you?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush already has been gathering his potential fund-raisers
around him who would likely serve on his exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime friend Don Evans, the finance chairman of Bush's
re-election campaign, is moving from Midland to Austin and is
expected to step down as chairman of the University of Texas board
of regents.
</P>
<P>
   Guests at the Governor's Mansion have included Los Angeles
investment banker Bradford Freeman, an unnamed Florida fund-raiser
and New Hampshire cable television executive Craig Benson, who last
week returned home to tell local supporters that Bush is definitely
running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has sent videotapes of his Election Night and
inaugural speeches to potential supporters across the country,
primarily drawn from a list of people who donated money to his
governor's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that this is a campaign, it's adroit to this
point,'' said University of Texas political science professor Bruce
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an advantage to being a little coy, in that it frees
you from some of the rugged scrutiny that the already-declared come
under,'' Buchanan said. ``It also highlights the fact, especially
if you are someone who can get people to come hat in hand to beg
you to run, it highlights the fact you are desirable and attractive
commodity.''

LAWMAKERS CRITICIZE INS BUDGET AS INADEQUATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas lawmakers accused the Clinton administration
Thursday of surrendering the drug war with a budget that fails to
add U.S. Border Patrol agents in the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee
on immigration, attacked the administration's budget priorities,
saying that 70 percent of illegal narcotics entering the United
States crosses the border with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Border Patrol is our primary line of defense, yet the
administration requested not one additional Border Patrol agent in
its next budget,'' said Smith, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also criticized a plan _ which the INS has now abandoned _
to release illegal immigrants with criminal records from crowded
deportation facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration's record on release of criminal aliens and
refusal to fund additional Border Patrol agents should be
disturbing to everyone in the country,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, defended the administration against the
charges and said ``criminal aliens'' would not be released as a way
to relieve crowded detention facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said that a year of consolidation was needed before
more Border Patrol agents are hired to ``ensure that we continue to
safeguard the highest standards of law enforcement professionalism
for this new work force.''
</P>
<P>
   Her testimony did little to sway critics of the administration's
policies and budget proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Silvestre Reyes, an El Paso Democrat and former Border
Patrol sector chief, said it was ``inexcusable'' for President
Clinton to send a budget without provisions to hire ``even one''
new agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in desperate need of agents in El Paso and across the
entire Southwest border,'' said Reyes, who testified via a
satellite television link.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol is part of the INS.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston, the ranking Democrat on the
immigration subcommittee, also questioned the lack of new Border
Patrol agents in the budget, but she cautioned her colleagues
against imposing hiring mandates on the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intent is not to scold the INS, but to point out the
deficiencies that need to be corrected,'' Jackson Lee said. ``And
that perhaps it is bad policy to engage in a massive hiring without
proper screening, background checks and training.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the subcommittee would seek an additional 1,000
agents for the Border Patrol for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1.
The Senate is expected to consider a similar increase.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Border Patrol agents has grown from 3,965 in 1993
to almost 9,000 this year. Smith, though, said the number is
inadequate for the borders with Mexico and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reyes was even more critical of the administration after meeting
with all five Border Patrol sector chiefs in Texas last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each and every one of them stated that they desperately need
more agents. They need more agents _ period,'' Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have voiced concern that the rapid hiring of
agents will lead to more brutality complaints from illegal
immigrants on the U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the time needed to train new recruits, Meissner
said, the agency's recruiting efforts have been hampered by the
robust U.S. economy, meaning INS has to compete for workers.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to release non-violent criminals who were awaiting
deportation hearings prompted Smith to call last week for
Meissner's resignation, if the proposal was carried out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not resigning,'' Meissner told reporters after she
testified.

BU, NORTHEASTERN FACE SEASON'S DEFINING MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, Del. _ A year ago, they came into the America East
tournament as defending champions, a favorite to repeat.
</P>
<P>
   Not so this season. If anything is consistent about the Boston
University basketball team this season, it is the Terriers'
inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   So many mistakes, so many moments of frustration. ``It's been
like Groundhog Day,'' BU coach Dennis Wolff said as he prepares his
eighth-seeded team for a first-round game against Towson State
Friday night at the University of Delaware's Carpenter Center.
</P>
<P>
   In the second game, No. 7 Northeastern will face No. 10 New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The winners advance to Saturday's quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   BU (9-17, 5-13) comes into the tournament with as experienced a
team as any in the league, with four starters returning from last
year's squad that tied Delaware for the regular-season
championship. But almost from the get-go, the Terriers have not
played with the kind of poise and skill that they showed last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a loss meaning the end of the season, Wolff hopes his
team can recall its past to prolong its future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't know,'' he said. ``I'm hopeful our older guys
want to go out and play hard. It's a new season and this is an
opportunity to try and play good basketball and redeem ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolff says he is at a loss to explain what has happened this
season. ``In a nutshell, we were somewhat fragile,'' he said. ``But
whatever it was, the fragile nature of our team became exposed. We
didn't continue to have the will to win we had in the past years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Terriers have swept Towson this season, including a 30-point
victory in January.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern has struggled as much as BU. The Huskies (9-17,
6-12) also have played below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The consistent bright spot for the Huskies has been
6-foot-2-inch sophomore Marcus Blossom, who has averaged 16.1
points and 4.2 rebounds per game.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for NU is that New Hampshire (4-22, 2-16) has been
far and away the worst team in the conference. The bad news is that
one of New Hampshire's two America East victories came against
Northeastern.
</P>
<P>
   Top seed Delaware, which can play all of its games on its home
court, comes in as the hottest team. The Blue Hens have run off 10
straight victories and have an average winning margin of 15.6
points during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise _ other than the decline of BU _ has been
the rise of Maine. The Black Bears were 4-14 in conference play
last year and jumped to 13-5 this season, going from the No. 10
seed to No. 4, the biggest jump in league history.
</P>
<P>
   The odds against either NU or BU getting past the second round
are enormous. The top four seeds _ Delaware, Drexel, Hofstra, and
Maine _ are a combined 41-3 against the rest of the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're selling our team that this is now a three-game season,''
said Drexel coach Bill Herrion, whose Dragons came from below .500
last season to earn a co-championship with Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   A three-game season, or in the case of BU and NU, maybe a
one-game season. It all will come to a head beginning Friday night.

 &HT;    GOVERNMENT CHARGES MICROSOFT WITH PLAYING WINDOWS FAVORITES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government accused Microsoft Corp. on Thursday
of having discounted the price of its Windows operating system to
personal computer makers who agreed to give the software giant
preferential treatment in its Internet browser battle with Netscape
Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most acerbic sessions to occur in the 18-week-long
Microsoft antitrust trial, Microsoft official Joachim Kempin
admitted on the witness stand that, Dell and Compaq, two
``friendly'' computer makers, pay a lower royalty for their Windows
licenses than does Gateway Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But Kempin branded as ``ridiculous'' that the favoritism shown
to the two Texas-based computer makers reflects their affinity for
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Kempin had testified that Gateway was the sole hardware
outlet to have asked Microsoft's permission to offer its customers
the Netscape browser early in the Windows ``boot-up'' cycle.
Kempin, the Microsoft senior vice president who supervises dealing
with all such firms, said he had approved the verbal request,
although, he added, Gateway had yet to follow up.
</P>
<P>
   The issue arose when David Boies, the lead counsel for the
Department of Justice, showed Kempin a 1997 Gateway confidential
memo which said Microsoft's browser policy ``definitely crosses the
line of what is legal.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo cited Microsoft's account manager, Brian Fujiwara, as
having told company officials that Microsoft viewed Gateway's use
of Netscape on its own Intranet as ``a huge issue.''
</P>
<P>
   It further quoted Fujiwara as telling his client that ``Dell
turned Netscape down because they did not want to hurt their
relationship with Microsoft. Therefore, they got special things
because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' Kempin shot back. Kempin also could not
recall meeting with Fujiwara on the browser issue even though the
memo said that Fujiwara had told Gateway officials about such an
upcoming session.
</P>
<P>
   The favoritism shown Dell, Kempin suggested, stems from Dell's
willingness to build its extensive Web site around Microsoft
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without going into details, is Compaq charged a lower price
than Gateway?'' Boies asked the witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's correct,'' Kempin replied.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said he would clear
the courtroom and take further testimony under seal if Boies sought
to delve too deeply into sensitive pricing issues.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Jackson superseded Boies' cross-examination to
question Kempin closely on Microsoft's dealings with Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   The judge cited a September 1997 memo brought into evidence that
Gateway officials had submitted at the request of government
trustbusters. It said Microsoft had told Gateway that its
insistence on continuing to offer its customers the rival Netscape
browser was ``a serious issue that could affect our whole
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised by that statement,'' Kempin told Jackson. ``I
don't even know if they offered Netscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Boies sought to show that Kempin had changed
his testimony many times in listing the reasons that lay behind
various Microsoft licensing decisions, as well as their timing.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson kept the court in session well beyond the usual late
afternoon closing in a bid to recess the trial by Friday evening.
Kempin is due to be followed by the last of 12 Microsoft defense
witnesses in this phase of the trial: Bob Muglia, a Microsoft vice
president who deals with Java programming issues.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEEKSKILL, N.Y. _ Twenty months ago, after more than a decade on
public assistance, Ann McGinniss transformed herself from a welfare
mother into a working mother.
</P>
<P>
   She now follows the rhythms of suburban parenthood, rising
before dawn to prepare her daughter and son for school, then
driving to her bookkeeping job at a car dealership.
</P>
<P>
   Her income _ $290 a week, take home _ means she is doing too
well to qualify for food stamps. Yet after rent, car payments,
insurance and utilities, she says, she has almost no cash left for
food.
</P>
<P>
   So almost every weekend, she reverts to a ritual of poverty. She
enlists her 12-year-old son to help her lug bags of groceries
gleaned from food pantries in the basements of nearby churches in
this northern Westchester County city.
</P>
<P>
   She is 40 now. Work, she had hoped, would allow her to end a
life of dependency. But she has simply come to rely on private
largesse instead of public aid. ``I'm tired of always having to
say, `Please help me,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGinniss is part of a stream of low-wage workers, retirees
and refugees from public assistance who are swelling the lines at
soup kitchens and food pantries across America.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Ms. McGinniss, are the welfare-to-work versions of an
old phenomenon: the working poor caught in the middle _ too well
off for public assistance but not well off enough to make it on
their own. Some are immigrants who are here legally but were cut
off from food stamps under new federal welfare laws.
</P>
<P>
   Some are following a path of least resistance: Rather than jump
through hoops meant to tarnish the appeal of public aid, they are
turning to private charities that ask few questions and require
little in return for the food they give away. And some, no doubt,
are lining up for free food simply because it is there.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they are changing the face of food lines long occupied
by the addicted, the disabled, the generally down-and-out. And they
may help explain a puzzle confronting poverty analysts: Why have
the lines kept growing when unemployment is at its lowest level in
a generation and the economy has remained healthy for years?
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, the picture remains murky. Neither the charities
nor the federal government has done detailed year-by-year studies
of food charities or their clientele. Even so, several states have
measured a steady growth in the doling out of free food.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the number of grocery handouts and soup kitchen
meals rose dramatically between 1987 and 1995, from 13.5 million to
slightly more than 21 million. And while new numbers will not be
released until later this year, officials believe the growth has
continued.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country in Arizona, the picture looks much the same.
After holding fairly steady from 1990 to 1993, the number of meals
distributed through the statewide food-charity network has since
risen 50 percent. And a 1997 study found that 41 percent of the
network's client families had at least one person with a job.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for this rising demand are not much more precise
than its statistical dimensions. But on both sides of the
ideological aisle, many people agree that tough new welfare
policies _ and the general squeamishness about public assistance
these days _ have had some role in lengthening the food lines.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, attention has focused on food stamps: specifically,
on a deep and unexpected drop in the number of people receiving
them, from 28 million to fewer than 19 million over the last four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Federal food-stamp officials and advocates for the poor say this
decline is far too steep to be attributed simply to welfare-to-work
success. Many people, they believe, remain eligible for food
stamps, but are shying away or being pushed away by overzealous
local officials. And there is growing evidence, they say, that
significant numbers of them are finding their way to the food
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was just that concern that late last year led the
Department of Agriculture, which runs the food-stamp program, to
commission the first federal study of who receives private food
handouts and why. Findings are expected in July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere, perhaps, is there a starker sign of such a shift than
in New York City, where workers at certain welfare offices,
rechristened ``job centers,'' began encouraging applicants last
year to head to nearby food pantries instead of seeking food
stamps. Last month, a federal judge ruled that this and other new
welfare-application procedures had improperly denied people prompt
access to food stamps and health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But a far fuller accounting comes from Wisconsin, which recently
released a study of its welfare-to-work program, generally seen as
the most rigorous and far-reaching in the nation. While the state
has had great success in moving people into jobs, the study found
that after leaving the rolls, families were 50 percent more likely
to say they did not have enough money for food. In all, nearly a
third reported such problems.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative groups that have helped shape new welfare
policies say that while tighter rules for aid have probably
lengthened the food lines, the shift from public to private aid is
long overdue. Charity, they say, is the responsibility of
communities, not governments.
</P>
<P>
   Other conservatives, though, question whether the lengthening
lines reflect dire need. Indeed, some of these analysts say, if the
private charities followed the trend in welfare offices and
required work or stricter means tests in return for food, the lines
would likely shrink. In essence, they say, the food pantries and
soup kitchens are the last bastion of the free lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always going to find recipients diverted to the most
lenient welfare system,'' said Robert Rector, a welfare analyst at
the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group in
Washington. ``They are breeding their own clientele.''
</P>
<P>
   But many liberal analysts and food-charity workers insist that,
in most cases, the need is quite genuine. ``Most people who don't
have a real need don't go stand in lines at soup kitchens,'' said
Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities, a research group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their motivation, rising numbers are repeat customers,
not just people seeking a one-time boost to get through a crisis.
And the growing presence of working people is leading the charities
to adjust their schedules and their style.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the pantry at St. Joseph's Church in Spring Valley,
N.Y., began opening up on Wednesday evenings; 5:30 on a recent
Wednesday brought a virtual rush hour, largely made up of working
immigrants from Haiti. By 6, more than 100 shopping bags loaded
with canned goods, bread and snacks were gone.
</P>
<P>
   And at the Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew's food pantry on
the Upper West Side of Manhattan, food is now displayed on shelves
like those in a supermarket, rather than simply handed out in bags.
The new setup, workers there say, dulls the stigma of accepting a
handout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen demand triple in the last 10 years,'' said Doreen
Wohl, executive director of the West Side Campaign Against Hunger,
which runs the dispensary. ``People who are working come more, now
that it feels like a store.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   On a chilly morning in Greenwich, Conn., as Range Rovers and
Lincoln town cars rolled along tree-lined Putnam Avenue, an
inconspicuous trickle of people made a different commute: down
stone steps and through a metal door into the basement of Christ
Church, where low-income families in this high-income town receive
weekly handouts from a charity called Neighbor to Neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a well-off town like Greenwich, they were a microcosm of
today's food lines.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Porter, 65, was laid off four years ago from a customer
service job at Valley Labs, a subsidiary of Pfizer. Now, her Social
Security payments and small pension add up to $1,000 a month,
enough for her public housing rent and other expenses, but not for
food. Her town social worker calculated she could qualify for food
stamps, she said, but only about $10 a month. ``It just wasn't
worth it,'' Ms. Porter explained.
</P>
<P>
   Many others had jobs. There was a cook from a local French
restaurant, a construction worker, housekeepers from nearby estates
who made the minimum wage, $5.15 an hour, and a woman who cared for
the children of housekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the free food was less a way to stave off hunger than
to preserve a precarious rendition of suburban stability.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Culver, 45, a bearded, booted construction worker,
stopped by on his lunch break to pick up groceries for himself, his
girlfriend, their 20-month-old baby and her three children.
Although his girlfriend works at a pharmacy, together they barely
make enough to pay their utilities, car costs and $1,500-a-month
apartment rent _ not a lot in a town where studio apartments go for
$1,000 a month. ``It's expensive here, but it's safe,'' Culver
said.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for free food in Greenwich grew so much last year
that when Neighbor to Neighbor's roster of certified clients hit
85, Greenwich opened its own food pantry in an unmarked walk-in
closet on the third floor of Town Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Like many welfare refugees across the nation, the people seeking
food have often moved from public assistance to low-paying jobs,
said Elisabeth Steinberg, director of adult and family services for
Greenwich. And while Connecticut has a relatively high cost of
living, the jobs obtained by people leaving welfare are mostly
part-time, often lack benefits and average $6.12 an hour, she said.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate people whose work schedules conflict with the
pantry hours, two town social workers have begun making food
deliveries on their own time.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Cynthia Bowser, began piling plastic bags of
groceries into her car on a recent morning, filling the back seat
nearly to the roof.
</P>
<P>
   At a parking lot in the center of town, Ms. Bowser circled until
she spotted a faded black Oldsmobile with a cracked windshield
parked amid the Explorers and Lexuses. The car belonged to Traci
Camacho, 32, a mother of three who makes $8 an hour as a baby
sitter at the Greenwich YMCA. Her husband, Erik, fixes elevators in
New York City, but his commutation costs alone are $280 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The family missed qualifying for food stamps by a few dollars,
Ms. Bowser said. So once a week, Ms. Camacho leaves the right front
door of her car unlocked when she goes to work, and Ms. Bowser
discreetly leaves the groceries inside.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most comprehensive statistical sign of this shifting
clientele came in a survey of tens of thousands of food pantries
and soup kitchens released last year by Second Harvest, the
nation's largest private network of food charities and the source
of much of the food at the Greenwich pantries. The survey found
that 60 percent of the 21 million recipients of Second Harvest food
in 1997 said they sought handouts because of a chronic food gap,
and nearly 40 percent of the households had at least one person
employed.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, when Second Harvest was created 20 years ago, most
of those seeking food were at charity's door for a one-time
handout, after their lives had been disrupted by a layoff or some
other emergency.
</P>
<P>
   In Homestead, Fla., on the fringe of the Everglades southwest of
Miami, crowds gather once or twice a month when a local group, Farm
Share, hands out canned goods and unsold produce collected from
nearby farms.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, drawn by fliers and newspaper ads, dozens, then
hundreds, of people gathered at a public park, towing collapsible
shopping carts or children's toy wagons, many bringing folding
chairs to endure the long wait in 90 degree heat. Some arrived
hours before dawn to claim slips of paper with numbers marking
their places in line, while volunteers and a work crew from a
nearby prison set out half-ton bins of tomatoes and sweet potatoes,
stacks of boxed papayas, and cases of frozen turkey breasts that
steamed in the humid air.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Johnson, 29, a mother of three and the wife of a cook
earning $19,000 a year, said a friend had told her about the
handouts last spring. Ms. Johnson, who recently returned to
college, said she was reluctant to go, never having relied on
charity or public aid. But after exhausting every other option, she
said, she began making the 40-minute drive to Homestead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make my own bread, I buy dry beans, I stretch the budget
every way I can, but I still have to come,'' she said. ``I'm
embarrassed and shocked,'' she added, scanning the ranks around
her. ``People I know volunteer here.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   At 10:30 on a recent weekday morning, a caseworker began her
standard speech to several dozen jobless men and women at the
Hamilton Job Center, a former welfare office in upper Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   She gave a grim description of the city's workfare program and
the relative benefits of even a minimum-wage job. Anyone looking
for immediate help with food, she told them, was basically in the
wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a job center,'' she said. ``If you need food, we have
lots of pantries that give good meat, good food _ not just tuna _
where we're going to send you for the next 35 or 50 days.''
</P>
<P>
   One who was turned away was 25-year-old Lakisha Reynolds, who
had sought food stamps and public assistance for herself and her
3-year-old son in December, seven months after losing a full-time
job and then a series of temporary jobs. In an affidavit filed as
part of the suit against the city in which the federal judge ruled
last month, she described the contents of her kitchen when she
applied for help: ``a piece of meat, two cans of vegetables, three
tangerines, some hot cereal, a little rice, and some carrots.'' By
the time she arrived at the food pantry that she was sent to, it
had run out of food, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The city is now formulating new procedures for the job centers,
in an effort to meet the objections the judge made as a result of
the suit. In the interim, it has changed the morning routine at the
Hamilton center, trading the staff speech for a videotape that
makes no mention of emergency food stamps. Jobless people who ask
for immediate food aid are directed to the line for welfare
benefits, where they must demonstrate their eligibility for food
stamps.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's welfare authorities have sought to draw an
extraordinarily hard line. But across the nation, there is growing
evidence of a link between the huge drop in the food stamp rolls
and the growing lines at the food-charity doors.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that drop can be attributed to the cutoff of food stamps
to legal immigrants that went into effect in the summer of 1997.
Surging lines at food charities through the following winter
eventually prompted Congress to restore food stamps for immigrant
children, the disabled and the elderly, but hundreds of thousands
of immigrants remain without food stamps altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Many other people, like Ann McGinniss, have lost food stamps
because they now make too much money; the limit is $1,138 in
monthly net income for a family of three. But often, what with
today's anti-welfare climate, the deterrent is simply an
unwillingness to deal with the hassle or stigma, or a lack of
understanding of who remains eligible for public food aid.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin's recent welfare study, for example, a third of
former welfare recipients incorrectly believed that simply having a
job automatically disqualified them from food stamps. Altogether,
49 percent stopped receiving food stamps after leaving the welfare
rolls, many more than could be accounted for simply by a higher
income, according to the study. And in Wisconsin, as in New York
City, people having trouble with food are often told to head to a
food pantry or soup kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the study, officials in Wisconsin say they are
planning to intensify their efforts to improve food stamp access.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the clearest statistical line away from government aid
to private charity comes from Arizona, where the drop in food stamp
use has almost precisely paralleled the rise in demand on the
state's food charities: From March 1994 to July 1998, participation
in the food stamp program declined more than 50 percent, according
to studies by state and federal poverty groups. In roughly the same
period of time, there was a 50 percent increase in the number of
meals distributed through the state's food-charity network.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics translate into a subculture in which households
float between work and welfare, food stamps and food pantries.
Sometimes, the hunt for food can seem like a second job.
</P>
<P>
   In Newburgh, N.Y., Yolanda Baptist and her boyfriend, Lawrence
McGriff, both 30, have a strict routine to feed themselves and Ms.
Baptist's three children. They walk around town for handouts or hot
meals, visiting different charities on different days, following a
printed guide distributed by a local ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Money and jobs come and go. McGriff's last job was at a Burger
King, but he stopped working after he broke his ankle. Ms. Baptist
has been selling Avon products, but still manages to receive
welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   On the eighth day of every month, Ms. Baptist picks up and
spends her food stamps. Recently, after a $130 shopping trip, she
filled the refrigerator, which the day before contained nothing
except a few leftovers and a small hunk of ham. Then she began
filling a separate freezer the family had found on the street, and
which they now used as a kind of savings account, for food instead
of money. By the end of the month, the account would be drawn down
nearly to zero again.
</P>
<P>
   In Peekskill, Ann McGinniss' life got more difficult this month
when her family lost its Medicaid benefits because of her income,
adding medical bills to an already tight budget.
</P>
<P>
   To get a little extra food, she continues to tell the volunteers
at some food pantries that she has four children, even though her
two oldest no longer live at home.
</P>
<P>
   With just $50 or $100 a month in food stamps, she said, ``I
could make it.'' Still, if a life of handouts is the price of
staying employed, it is worth it; anything, she added, is better
than the years she lost on welfare _ a stream of soap operas
watched from the couch, punctuated by fights with her longtime
boyfriend, who has since fled to Florida without paying child
support. ``One way or the other,'' she said, ``I'm not going
back.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PEEKSKILL, N.Y. _ Twenty months ago, after more than a decade on
public assistance, Ann McGinniss transformed herself from a welfare
mother into a working mother.
</P>
<P>
   She now follows the rhythms of suburban parenthood, rising
before dawn to prepare her daughter and son for school, then
driving to her bookkeeping job at a car dealership.
</P>
<P>
   Her income _ $290 a week, take home _ means she is doing too
well to qualify for food stamps. Yet after rent, car payments,
insurance and utilities, she says, she has almost no cash left for
food.
</P>
<P>
   So almost every weekend, she reverts to a ritual of poverty. She
enlists her 12-year-old son to help her lug bags of groceries
gleaned from food pantries in the basements of nearby churches in
this northern Westchester County city.
</P>
<P>
   She is 40 now. Work, she had hoped, would allow her to end a
life of dependency. But she has simply come to rely on private
largesse instead of public aid. ``I'm tired of always having to
say, `Please help me,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGinniss is part of a stream of low-wage workers, retirees
and refugees from public assistance who are swelling the lines at
soup kitchens and food pantries across America.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Ms. McGinniss, are the welfare-to-work versions of an
old phenomenon: the working poor caught in the middle _ too well
off for public assistance but not well off enough to make it on
their own. Some are immigrants who are here legally but were cut
off from food stamps under new federal welfare laws.
</P>
<P>
   Some are following a path of least resistance: Rather than jump
through hoops meant to tarnish the appeal of public aid, they are
turning to private charities that ask few questions and require
little in return for the food they give away. And some, no doubt,
are lining up for free food simply because it is there.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they are changing the face of food lines long occupied
by the addicted, the disabled, the generally down-and-out. And they
may help explain a puzzle confronting poverty analysts: Why have
the lines kept growing when unemployment is at its lowest level in
a generation and the economy has remained healthy for years?
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, the picture remains murky. Neither the charities
nor the federal government has done detailed year-by-year studies
of food charities or their clientele. Even so, several states have
measured a steady growth in the doling out of free food.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the number of grocery handouts and soup kitchen
meals rose dramatically between 1987 and 1995, from 13.5 million to
slightly more than 21 million. And while new numbers will not be
released until later this year, officials believe the growth has
continued.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country in Arizona, the picture looks much the same.
After holding fairly steady from 1990 to 1993, the number of meals
distributed through the statewide food-charity network has since
risen 50 percent. And a 1997 study found that 41 percent of the
network's client families had at least one person with a job.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for this rising demand are not much more precise
than its statistical dimensions. But on both sides of the
ideological aisle, many people agree that tough new welfare
policies _ and the general squeamishness about public assistance
these days _ have had some role in lengthening the food lines.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, attention has focused on food stamps: specifically,
on a deep and unexpected drop in the number of people receiving
them, from 28 million to fewer than 19 million over the last four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Federal food-stamp officials and advocates for the poor say this
decline is far too steep to be attributed simply to welfare-to-work
success. Many people, they believe, remain eligible for food
stamps, but are shying away or being pushed away by overzealous
local officials. And there is growing evidence, they say, that
significant numbers of them are finding their way to the food
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was just that concern that late last year led the
Department of Agriculture, which runs the food-stamp program, to
commission the first federal study of who receives private food
handouts and why. Findings are expected in July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere, perhaps, is there a starker sign of such a shift than
in New York City, where workers at certain welfare offices,
rechristened ``job centers,'' began encouraging applicants last
year to head to nearby food pantries instead of seeking food
stamps. Last month, a federal judge ruled that this and other new
welfare-application procedures had improperly denied people prompt
access to food stamps and health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But a far fuller accounting comes from Wisconsin, which recently
released a study of its welfare-to-work program, generally seen as
the most rigorous and far-reaching in the nation. While the state
has had great success in moving people into jobs, the study found
that after leaving the rolls, families were 50 percent more likely
to say they did not have enough money for food. In all, nearly a
third reported such problems.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative groups that have helped shape new welfare
policies say that while tighter rules for aid have probably
lengthened the food lines, the shift from public to private aid is
long overdue. Charity, they say, is the responsibility of
communities, not governments.
</P>
<P>
   Other conservatives, though, question whether the lengthening
lines reflect dire need, saying in essence that the food pantries
and soup kitchens are the last bastion of the free lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their motivation, rising numbers are repeat customers,
not just people seeking a one-time boost to get through a crisis.
And the growing presence of working people is leading the charities
to adjust their schedules and their style.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the pantry at St. Joseph's Church in Spring Valley,
N.Y., began opening up on Wednesday evenings; 5:30 on a recent
Wednesday brought a virtual rush hour, largely made up of working
immigrants from Haiti. By 6, more than 100 shopping bags loaded
with canned goods, bread and snacks were gone.
</P>
<P>
   And at the Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew's food pantry on
the Upper West Side of Manhattan, food is now displayed on shelves
like those in a supermarket, rather than simply handed out in bags.
The new setup, workers there say, dulls the stigma of accepting a
handout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen demand triple in the last 10 years,'' said Doreen
Wohl, executive director of the West Side Campaign Against Hunger,
which runs the dispensary.
</P>
<P>
   On a chilly morning in Greenwich, Conn., as Range Rovers and
Lincoln town cars rolled along tree-lined Putnam Avenue, an
inconspicuous trickle of people made a different commute: down
stone steps and through a metal door into the basement of Christ
Church, where low-income families in this high-income town receive
weekly handouts from a charity called Neighbor to Neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a well-off town like Greenwich, they were a microcosm of
today's food lines.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Porter, 65, was laid off four years ago from a customer
service job at Valley Labs, a subsidiary of Pfizer. Now, her Social
Security payments and small pension add up to $1,000 a month,
enough for her public housing rent and other expenses, but not for
food. Her town social worker calculated she could qualify for food
stamps, she said, but only about $10 a month. ``It just wasn't
worth it,'' Ms. Porter explained.
</P>
<P>
   Many others had jobs. There was a cook from a local French
restaurant, a construction worker, housekeepers from nearby estates
who made the minimum wage, $5.15 an hour, and a woman who cared for
the children of housekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   In Homestead, Fla., on the fringe of the Everglades southwest of
Miami, crowds gather once or twice a month when a local group, Farm
Share, hands out canned goods and unsold produce collected from
nearby farms. On a recent day, dozens, then hundreds, of people
gathered at a public park, many bringing folding chairs to endure
the long wait in 90 degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Johnson, 29, a mother of three and the wife of a cook
earning $19,000 a year, said she was reluctant to come, never
having relied on charity or public aid. But after exhausting every
other option, she said, she began making the 40-minute drive to
Homestead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make my own bread, I buy dry beans, I stretch the budget
every way I can, but I still have to come,'' she said. ``I'm
embarrassed and shocked,'' she added, scanning the ranks around
her. ``People I know volunteer here.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Peekskill, N.Y., Ann McGinniss' life got more difficult
this month when her family lost its Medicaid benefits because of
her income, adding medical bills to an already tight budget.
</P>
<P>
   To get a little extra food, she continues to tell the volunteers
at some food pantries that she has four children, even though her
two oldest no longer live at home.
</P>
<P>
   With just $50 or $100 a month in food stamps, she said, ``I
could make it.'' Still, if a life of handouts is the price of
staying employed, it is worth it; anything, she added, is better
than the years she lost on welfare _ a stream of soap operas
watched from the couch, punctuated by fights with her longtime
boyfriend, who has since fled to Florida without paying child
support. ``One way or the other,'' she said, ``I'm not going
back.''

 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By JESSE MCKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``The Lonesome West,'' the latest offering from
Martin McDonagh, the 28-year-old Irish playwright, will land on
Broadway on April 27, just one day shy of this year's deadline for
Tony award nominations.
</P>
<P>
   The play's producer, Randall Wreghitt, said on Wednesday that he
could not name the theater where the play would run. But he said it
would begin previews on April 20 and open a week later. One
possible home is the Lyceum, where ``Night Must Fall,'' which opens
on March 8, is to end its run in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lonesome West,'' the story of feuding Irish brothers, is
actually the final part of McDonagh's ``Leenane Trilogy,'' which
begins with ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane,'' currently at the
Walter Kerr Theater. The second segment, ``A Skull in Connemara,''
has not yet been produced in the United States. All three are set
in the rural town of Leenane. ``The Lonesome West'' includes
several characters mentioned in ``Beauty Queen.''
</P>
<P>
   The play, produced in 1997 in London by the Druid Theater
Company of Galway, will be directed by the company's artistic
director, Garry Hynes, who won a Tony for ``Beauty Queen.'' A cast
has not been announced, though producers hope to bring several
actors from the original production, pending approval by Actors
Equity. ``We felt the time was right to capitalize on Martin's
success, on Garry's success and `Beauty Queen's' success,''
Wreghitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hynes, in a telephone interview from Ireland, said of the
play: ``You'll recognize the voice. The characters all live in the
same god-awful patch of fictional territory'' as those in ``Beauty
Queen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lonesome West'' will give McDonagh another shot at a Tony.
Last year, ``Beauty Queen,'' which had been favored to win the
award for best play, was upset by ``Art,'' Yasmina Reza's comedy,
which is at the Royale Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lonesome West'' enters an already crowded field of
straight plays and potential Tony contenders, including several
British imports: ``The Blue Room'' and the soon to open ``Closer,''
``Amy's View,'' ``Via Dolorosa,'' ``The Weir'' and ``Marlene.'' The
other contender will very likely be ``Side Man,'' the sole
contestant written by an American, which producers say they are
determined to keep open until Tony time, despite lagging ticket
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Wreghitt, who was also a producer on the profitable ``Beauty
Queen,'' said he recognized the strength of the spring's
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a lot of plays _ it's a lot of good plays,'' he
said. ``There's not a dog in the bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   `Ragtime' in Court
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the creative team of ``Ragtime'' are scheduled to
appear in federal bankruptcy court on Wednesday to argue a motion
aimed at nudging Livent, the musical's bankrupt producer, into
paying $682,487 in fees the artists say they are owed.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers assert in court documents that the composer Stephen
Flaherty, the lyricist Lynn Ahrens and the book writer Terrence
McNally are collectively owed $385,748 in salaries, royalties and
other fees; the documents also say the choreographer Graciela
Daniele is owed $78,105 and the director Frank Galati, $81,173.
</P>
<P>
   Also scheduled to be argued is a claim by E.L. Doctorow, author
of the novel ``Ragtime,'' who says he is owed $137,461 from the
time before the bankruptcy. The motions involve mostly payments the
artists say they were owed before Nov. 18, 1998, when Livent went
into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Badenhausen, a Livent spokesman, said the company would not
comment on the figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Livent has paid and continues to pay all of its obligations
incurred since the bankruptcy filing,'' Badenhausen said.
``However, bankruptcy law prevents Livent from acting upon
obligations incurred prior to the bankruptcy filing until the
company finishes its reorganization.''
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Angel, a lawyer for the creative team, said negotiations
were also going on outside the courtroom for settlement of the
debts.
</P>
<P>
   Slam Dunk
</P>
<P>
   The director Scott Ellis began rehearsals this week for the
Second Stage's revival of ``That Championship Season'' by putting
his five-man cast to work on their game.
</P>
<P>
   The 1971 play concerns the reunion of a former champion high
school basketball team. The revival stars Dylan Baker, late of the
film ``Happiness,'' Ray Baker, James Gammon, Michael O'Keefe and
Vyto Ruginis, all of whom are set to suit up Friday for a
three-hour practice at Xavier High School on West 16th Street. The
idea, Ellis said, is to build camaraderie and skills.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Ellis promises to put his team up for a scrimmage
game against a yet-to-be determined squad. Any volunteers can call
(212) 787-8302.
</P>
<P>
   Casting Scene
</P>
<P>
   Some casting tidbits: First, Mo Gaffney, who plays Swoosie
Kurtz's boyfriend (in one role) and her female lover (in another),
will leave the cast of ``The Mineola Twins'' at the Roundabout's
Laura Pels Theater in March. The reason? Ms. Gaffney is pregnant.
Julie Kavner has been mentioned as a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Lea DeLaria has signed on to replace Becky Ann Baker as Jane in
``The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told,'' at the Minetta Lane Theater.
Ms. DeLaria, late of ``On the Town,'' begins performances on March
16.
</P>
<P>
   And, third, Anne Pitoniak, who made her name as the mother in
``'Night, Mother,'' in 1983, will play another mother _ in-law,
this time _ in David Hare's ``Amy's View,'' coming to the Barrymore
Theater in April.
</P>
<P>
   Egad!
</P>
<P>
   Here's a trend: Pick a famous historical figure or a classic;
add an exclamation point; put on a show. Already seen this season
have been ``Eight!'' about King Henry VIII; ``Whoa-Jack!'' an
adaption of ``Woyzeck,'' and ``Lyz!'' based on ``Lysistrata'' and
presented, no kidding, by a company called Rakka-Thamm!!!
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ``Oh, Coward!'' running at the Irish Repertory
Company; ``Clarence Darrow Tonight!'' with Laurence Luckinbill,
opening at Ensemble Studio Theater on Wednesday, and ``E.E.!''
described as a musical revue of the life of E.E. Cummings, in April
at the new Blue Heron Arts Center. All this is enough to make you
say ``Oy!'' _ a show now playing at Theater 3.

CLINTON PUSHES PLAN TO EXTEND LIFE OF MEDICARE, SOCIAL SECURITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Speaking in a state that has become a mecca for
retirees, President Clinton on Thursday plugged his plan to extend
the life of Social Security and Medicare by devoting a big chunk of
the surplus to shore up these programs for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to a friendly crowd at the convention center in
Tucson, the president backed off anticipated criticism of
congressional Republicans for initially pushing a 10 percent tax
cut that could threaten his plans for the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton praised Republicans for agreeing with his
proposal to devote 62 percent of the surplus over the next 15 years
to Social Security. Furthermore, he said, ``there seems to be, now,
some movement in the Republican majority away from having a large
across-the-board tax cut if it would take away the surplus' ability
to save Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Those comments were far more conciliatory than the prepared
statements for the event given to reporters shortly before Clinton
spoke, which had the president saying, ``I am pleased that
Republican leaders are rethinking their indiscriminate tax cut that
would squander our surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   The president may have tempered his remarks as more and more
Republicans have acknowledged that they will not be able to pass an
across-the-board tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also said that he had not yet persuaded Republicans
to accept his proposal to devote 15 percent of the surplus to shore
up Medicare, the health insurance program that faces fiscal strains
far sooner than Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that Medicare will be in trouble in about a decade
despite efforts to crack down on fraud and ``the easy savings that
could be squeezed out from managed care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't sustain the present budgeted cost of Medicare. We're
going to have to put some more money into it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the president defended one of the more controversial aspects
of his Social Security plan, allowing the government to invest a
small portion of the retirement funds in the private market.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including many Republicans, have said such a plan would
give the federal government too much control over private
enterprise. They complain such investments would be susceptible to
political pressure from lawmakers who wanted to boycott certain
companies or products.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said that state and municipal retirement plans
already invest in the private market. He added that his plan would
stipulate that an independent board oversee investment decisions to
deter politicians from trying to influence the investments. He also
noted that his plan only calls for the investment of 4 percent of
the retirement money in the markets.
</P>
<P>
   The president also stressed a politically appealing aspect of
his Social Security plan; that it would involve eliminating the
national debt in 19 years. That would mean lower interest rates and
economic growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton avoided overt partisanship, the lingering tensions
and resentments from his impeachment trial were still evident.
Outside the convention center, protesters chanted and held signs,
including ``I believe Juanita,'' a reference to Juanita Broaddrick,
who claimed Clinton sexually assaulted her in 1978 when he was
Arkansas Attorney General.
</P>
<P>
   And inside the hall, many in the crowd booed Rep. Jim Kolbe, a
Republican congressman from Tucson who voted to impeach the
president but nevertheless sat on the stage with Clinton at the
event and spoke before the president. Kolbe, who accompanied the
president on Air Force One from Washington, said he did not view it
as unusual or strange to work so closely with someone he wanted to
oust from office.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was in the Republicans' best interest to work with
Clinton on Social Security for their own political survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans know that fixing Social Security is the only thing
that gives us hope of staying in the majority,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe acknowledged that the Republican proposal for a 10 percent
tax cut is dead, saying that the public is more interested in
paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by a number of those who came to see
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the idea of using the money to pay down the national
debt,'' said Mike Carnahan, a 45-year-old airline employee who said
he was a Republican who did not vote for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, however, said he was wary of plans to let the
government or individuals invest too much of their Social Security
money in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market is a fickle beast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Ridgley, 62, said she liked Clinton's ideas about Social
Security but doubted that Republicans in Congress would work with
him because of their anger that he emerged victorious in the
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dirty, long drawn-out trial, and I think they're
going to make him pay for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ridgley and her two daughters said they were annoyed that Kolbe
had attended the forum after he voted to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a lot of nerve coming up there,'' said Vanesia Ridgley,
28, a medical receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   After the Social Security event, Clinton visited the Arizona
Diamondbacks spring training baseball facility. He later flew to
San Francisco where he attended a $12,500 per person Democratic
fund-raiser.

   NEW YORK _ Here is a selective listing by critics of The New
York Times of new or noteworthy movies currently playing in
theaters. Running times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AFFLICTION,' starring Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Willem Dafoe,
Sissy Spacek and Mary Beth Hurt. Directed by Paul Schrader (R, 114
minutes). Nolte is devastating in the performance of his career, as
Wade Whitehouse, a New Hampshire loner fighting a losing battle
with demons from his past. Foremost among them: Coburn,
terrifyingly authentic as the drunken, abusive father who long ago
cowed his sons into submission. As directed by Schrader, this pure,
unfettered adaptation of Russell Banks' novel starts on a
deceptively ordinary note, then escalates into inexorable fury.
Every little detail matters. Ms. Spacek and Ms. Hurt expertly play
the women who trigger Wade's crisis (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BLAST FROM THE PAST,' starring Brendan Fraser, Christopher
Walken, Alicia Silverstone and Sissy Spacek. Directed by Hugh
Wilson (PG-13, 105 minutes). More amusingly than might be expected,
this comedy tells the story of one very nuclear family that has
been hiding in a fallout shelter since 1962, and emerges into a 90s
world of grunge and attitude. In fact, it's funnier underground,
with Fraser as the strapping son of a cheerfully mad scientist (
Walken) and sherry-sipping housewife (Ms. Spacek), 1962 style. Once
he comes above ground and meets a hard-boiled Ms. Silverstone, it's
clear that Fraser is once again a film's true ingenue, doing the
wide-eyed hunk thing that has become his specialty. He does it a
lot better in ``Gods and Monsters,'' but this comedy is still
lighthearted fun (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `CENTRAL STATION,' starring Fernanda Montenegro. Directed by
Walter Salles (R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian
gem a joyless older woman crosses paths with an orphaned boy.
There's plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of
Salles' film is all in the telling. As these characters develop a
fractious bond, then embark on a road trip that takes them vividly
to Brazil's hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Salles
brings great tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate
their journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one
of last year's very best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `A CIVIL ACTION,' starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall.
Directed by Steven Zaillian (PG-13, 120 minutes). This story of a
David-Goliath lawsuit against industrial polluters, with Travolta
first rate as an ambulance chaser who develops a conscience, could
have been business as usual in the legal thriller genre. But
Zaillian's keenly observed, beautifully acted film, based on
Jonathan Harr's nonfiction best seller about a case in Woburn,
Mass., doesn't follow familiar formulas. It follows all the
surprises and frustrations of a story that was never black and
white and is all the better for its shades of gray. Duvall is
outstanding as a corporate lawyer full of wily tricks (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `MY FAVORITE MARTIAN,' starring Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels
and Ray Walston. Directed by Donald Petrie (PG, 88 minutes).
Pixilated pixels and other up-to-the-minute movie-making magic
manage the neat feat of turning the big-screen, resurrected ``My
Favorite Martian'' into an amiable family entertainment. In this
updated version of the 1960s CBS sitcom, Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara
(now a television newsman rather than a newspaper reporter) and
Christopher Lloyd as the visitor from another planet, take over the
roles played by Bill Bixby and Ray Walston. In one of the happy and
logical little jokes that lend a disarming charm to the comedy,
Walston turns up once again in a welcome guise as government
bloodhounds set out to capture the Martian. But a good deal of the
fun in this tale is provided by Zoot, his high-spirited polymorphic
space suit (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   `HILARY AND JACKIE,' starring Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths.
Directed by Anand Tucker (R, 121 minutes). The parallel biographies
of the brilliant cellist Jacqueline du Pre (Ms. Watson), who
contracted multiple sclerosis at the height of her career, and her
slightly older sister, Hilary (Ms. Griffiths), a talented flutist
who gave up a professional career to marry and be ``ordinary,'' is
one of the most insightful studies of sibling rivalry ever filmed.
Jacqueline may have won fame and glory, the movie says, but she
remained a desperately needy emotional child who had to have
everything Hilary had (including Hilary's husband). The film is
structured like a concerto, in three movements, the last of which
ends with Jackie's harrowing death in her sister's arms. The drama
is deepened by a soundtrack that makes expert use of Jacqueline's
signature piece, the Elgar Cello Concerto in E minor. Ms. Watson's
Jacqueline flames with an almost scary intensity (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `JAWBREAKER,' starring Rose McGowan, Julie Benz, Rebecca
Gayheart and Judy Greer. Directed by Darren Stein (R, 85 minutes).
More nasty schoolgirls, and this time they're meant to be as hard
as the candy of the title. Intending more of a spoof than he
delivers, Stein introduces spike-heeled teen-age queens who
accidentally kill one of their own. Bummer! They spend the rest of
the story tarting up the class nerd so that she'll keep their
secret. This slender story is accompanied by lots of references to
other, better films in this genre, from ``Grease'' to ``Heathers,''
in a movie that (despite flashy directorial touches) doesn't show
much personality of its own. Special bonus: Marilyn Manson without
makeup is the guy in the bar (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL,' directed by and starring Roberto Benigni
(PG-13, 122 minutes). Italy's most antic funny man dares to find
humor and tenderness in the midst of the Holocaust, and his risk
pays off. This Cannes prize winner is as stubbornly entertaining as
its central character, a Jewish waiter named Guido who jokes his
way through the nightmare for the sake of his loved ones. Daring
also to combine an opening hour of romance and pranks with a more
somber second act, Benigni avoids all traces of the maudlin and
effectively creates a situation in which comedy is courage. In this
unpretentious, enormously likable film he shines as a father whose
fibs and hilarious buffoonery know no bounds, and no fear (Maslin).

NEW YORK: fear (Maslin).  
<TEXT>
<P>
   `MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE,' starring Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn
and Paul Newman. Directed by Luis Mandoki (PG-13, 110 minutes).
Nicholas Sparks' best-selling novel, about a lonely, sensitive man
who sends a message out to sea and the lonely, beautiful woman who
finds it, is now a long and soggy film. Kevin Costner crosses the
line from teasingly laconic to stodgy and seems as likely to have
written ``Bleak House'' as the love letter in question. Robin
Wright Penn makes an appealing heroine, but there's not much room
for real emotion in a film with the tenor of a commercial for
hazelnut-flavored coffee. As the hero's crusty old father, Newman
steals what's left of the show (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `OCTOBER SKY,' starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper.
Directed by Joe Johnston (PG, 100 minutes). By far the most moving
scenes here are home movie snippets, circa 1957, that show the real
people on whom the film's characters are based. Otherwise, despite
being closely based on a best-selling memoir (``Rocket Boys'') by
the NASA engineer Homer H. Hickam Jr., this earnest, nostalgic film
has a way of seeming too good to be true. The film's simplicity is
appealing, as is Gyllenhaal in the central role of a boy in a West
Virginia coal mining town who becomes obsessed with rocketry. But
the story, filled with father-son conflict and down-in-the-ground
versus up-in-the-sky contrasts, often follows a familiar trajectory
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `PAYBACK,' starring Mel Gibson and Gregg Henry. Directed by
Brian Helgeland (R, 110 minutes). In this inept, excessively
sadistic film-noir spoof adapted from the same Richard Stark novel
(``The Hunter'') that inspired the 1967 genre classic ``Point
Blank'' Gibson is a thief named Porter who retaliates with a
vengeance after an attempt on his life. Determined to recover
$70,000 that was stolen from him by a double-crossing partner in
crime, he works his way up the pecking order of a crime syndicate
brutally dispatching all who stand in his way. The hard-boiled
dialogue is ludicrous, the storytelling clunky, the acting fair to
awful, the gore ankle deep. Credit the star with being able to keep
a straight face through this loathsome mess (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `RUSHMORE,' starring Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and Olivia
Williams. Directed by Wes Anderson (R, 93 minutes). A dryly
hilarious portrait of the mogul as a young man, with Schwartzman a
real find as its perfectly horrid little hero, Max Fischer. Max's
prep school, Rushmore Academy, does have a faculty, but none of the
grown-ups have anything like Max's natural authority. Murray is
sneakily fine as the steel tycoon and Rushmore benefactor who
happens to be on Max's own wavelength as they vie for the same
beautiful teacher. A particular treat for its skewed, outrageously
funny memories of a cutthroat boyhood (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE,' starring Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth
Paltrow. Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy
and merrily literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise
that only gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay,
originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard
into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his ``Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead,'' dares to imagine whatever it likes about
the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad
yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile this
tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater
fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today and
has great fun presenting the creation of ``Romeo and Juliet,''
glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous
duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring
performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `A SIMPLE PLAN,' starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and
Bridget Fonda. Directed by Sam Raimi (R, 120 minutes). This onetime
cult horror director makes a flawless transition to mainstream
storytelling with a quietly devastating thriller. And its fine cast
plays out the consequences of a harmless-sounding error in judgment
that winds up leveling everything in its path. The catalyst is $4.4
million that literally falls out of the sky, and Scott B. Smith's
story proves how deadly the morality of expediency can become. When
you get the shivers watching this wintry tale, which features an
especially memorable performance from Thornton, it won't be from
the cold (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TANGO,' starring Miguel Angel Sola. Written and directed by
Carlos Saura. Cinematography by Vittorio Storaro (PG-13, 100
minutes). A thrilling display of tango heat and virtuosity. And
it's no slight to the actors who play lovers to say that the
dancing here is steamier than any kiss. In his most electrifying
dance film Saura offers transfixingly beautiful glimpses of the
dance and the great range of emotions it can conjure. Storaro's
dazzlingly fluid cinematography captures all the nuances this
material demands. Everyone in the film is utterly consumed by tango
fever; audiences will be, too (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE THIN RED LINE,' starring Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, Nick
Nolte and Sean Penn. Directed by Terrence Malick (R, 166 minutes).
From the first frame of this huge, drifting war epic loosely
derived from James Jones' Guadalcanal novel, it's viscerally clear
that Malick is back. The exquisite, oddly detached visual style
that made ``Badlands'' and ``Days of Heaven'' the most beautiful
films of the 1970s is instantly apparent here, even if the
narrative vagueness and brooding voice-overs are also familiar. The
film sprawls, gets lost and occasionally delivers visual poetry,
the kind that could have been greatly helped by tighter editing.
Bottom line: No one who admired Malick's early work should miss
this. But those expecting anything simple will not find it here
(Maslin).

<HEADLINE>
SIDES CONTINUE BATTLE OVER CLASS-ACTION LAWSUITS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Business people seeking restrictions on
class-action lawsuits told a Senate subcommittee that class actions
often force businesses into costly settlements even if they may be
innocent of alleged wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates testified that the right of people with a
common complaint to band together in a class-action suit was one of
the ``last remaining recourses'' that consumers have against
deceptive business practices.
</P>
<P>
   The fight is another chapter in the ongoing effort by business
groups to put more restrictions on civil suits and damage judgments
awarded by the state courts.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 274 by state Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, would
require consumers with a beef against a business to first try to
resolve their problem before a state agency with regulatory
authority over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   To give the agency time to tackle the problem, a judge would
have to postpone action on a class-action suit at least six months
_ or longer if the court determines that the agency is ``proceeding
diligently to resolve the matters.''
</P>
<P>
   A judge would be required to dismiss a suit if the court
determined that a state agency had granted ``all or a substantial
part of the relief'' sought by claimants.
</P>
<P>
   If a judge eventually determines that a class-action suit is
warranted, the proceedings could again be delayed to give the
defendants time to appeal the certification to the Texas Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Ratliff, an Austin attorney representing the Texas Civil
Justice League, a business group, said the restrictions were
necessary because class actions have been abused.
</P>
<P>
   Some cases, he said, can involve hundreds of thousands or even
millions of plaintiffs in a certified class, representing a huge
potential loss for a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been very few class actions that have gone to
trial,'' Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, he added, the defendants settle to avoid higher
losses even though the claims against them haven't been proved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is so extreme from bankers, they go in and make a
deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some business owners also contend that class actions are
manipulated by plaintiffs' lawyers to get high fees, while their
individual clients often are paid only modest damages.
</P>
<P>
   But two retired teachers, Billy and Donna Davis of Krum, said a
class action was the only way they and thousands of other retired
educators could recover retirement funds, which they lost in a
deceptive insurance company investment scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The former teachers said they went to court after a complaint
they had filed with the Texas Department of Insurance languished
for two years without action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want anyone to have to go through what we went
through. But this could happen to anyone,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Lambe, executive director of Texas Watch, a consumer
research and advocacy group, said the state insurance department
and other state regulatory agencies aren't adequately funded to
handle the additional chores that Bivins' bill would impose.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee postponed action on the bill, which also was
opposed by the Texas Trial Lawyers Association.

CLINTON-ARIZONA (Tucson, Ariz.) - President Clinton travels to
Arizona to visit with the Udall family, schmooze with snowbirds
over Social Security and hit a few with the boys of summer. By PAT
FLANNERY. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MEXFEE (Phoenix) - Mexico will start charging a $15 fee to enter
the interior of country on July 1. That will be at point 12 miles
south of Nogales and Agua Prieta and we're checking on Rocky Point.
By MARK SHAFFER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GAYKIDS (Gilbert, Ariz.) - Jesse Evans has had people spit on him,
hurl sexual slurs and throw trash at him. But he refuses to be
scared to admit he is gay. He and about 20 other students at
Gilbert High School formed the Gays, Lesbians and Straight
Supporters club earlier this year, much to the dismay of district
officials and even state lawmakers. It's believed to be the only
one of its kind in the Phoenix area. ``Things have been tense on
campus,'' said the 17-year-old senior, a red-ribbon pin on his
long-sleeved shirt. ``Gilbert is the last place you would expect
this club.'' We explore the pressures of being a teen-age
homosexual and why the club came to be. By KELLY PEARCE. Story
moved in the ``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
EDIT-CLINTON (Phoenx) - - Dear Mr. President:
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy your visit.
</P>
<P>
   No offense, sir, but don't you have more important things to do

presidential election? Story moved in the ``K'' category. &QL;

  Does your baby have diaper rash? You could search for solutions
on an Internet site called Baby Center. Looking for a Mexican
restaurant in Los Angeles? The Los Angeles Times site has listings.
How about a place to buy a camcorder? CompareNet, a consumer guide
site, lists online stores.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The answers appear almost instantly: Johnson &AMP; Johnson baby
powder; El Cholo restaurant; Netmarket, an online store. Those
might appear to be reliable recommendations, because each of those
Internet sites has a staff of editors writing what is put forward
as objective information. But in each search, with little or no
disclosure, the sites given favorable placement are those of paying
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Skewed searches are just one of the many ways that advertising
is being woven into the very fabric of the World Wide Web:
</P>
<P>
   _ On CNNfn, the travel page listed on the financial news site's
main menu blends CNN travel articles with reservation services and
promotions from a sponsoring travel agency.
</P>
<P>
   _ A page on hair loss in America Online's health section
features three prominent links. Two lead to articles in online
publications; the other, in the same format, goes to a site selling
treatments for baldness.
</P>
<P>
   _ The site for the youth-oriented television series ``Dawson's
Creek'' has stories of its characters getting their hair done at
the Dep Capeside Salon, filled with paid promotion of Dep hair
products.
</P>
<P>
   American media companies have traditionally aspired to
distinguish between paid advertising and features created by
producers or editors with no objective other than to appeal to
their audience. But on the Internet, with bookstores becoming
literary reviews and news outlets turning into travel agents, it is
getting hard to find a source of information that does not have a
financial stake in what users do with what they publish.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent example arose this month when Amazon.com, the online
bookstore that grew popular in part because of its many book
reviews submitted by readers and its own literate staff, admitted
that in some cases its most prominent review treatment _ under
headings like ``What We're Reading'' and ``Destined for Greatness''
_ was being accorded to books whose publishers had paid for the
favor.
</P>
<P>
   Trusting an Internet site to navigate the World Wide Web, in
short, is like following a helpful stranger in Morocco who offers
to take you to the best rug store. You may well find what you are
looking for, but your guide will get a piece of whatever you spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone going online should assume that there is an advertising
influence on most of the content they see,'' said Gordon M. Tucker,
the chief executive of the E-greetings Network, which gives away
electronic greeting cards hoping to make money selling gifts. ``A
smart consumer today is a skeptical consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many of the leaders of Internet companies say the
traditional lines between advertising and editorial content just do
not apply online. ``This medium is very different from magazines,
where the rules of the road have been codified over the years,''
said Barry M. Schuler, the head of America Online's flagship online
service. ``Our users do not care what the financial relationship is
between us and the provider of the content they see. They care
about whether it is convenient and does what they want it to.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet executives worry the industry has become so
greedy that it is hurting itself in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often look at sites and say it's just hard to tell where a
piece of information came from,'' said Richard Gingras, the editor
in chief of At Home Network, a high-speed Internet service.
``People still do not trust the Internet, and they are not ever
going to if they feel that the sites they go to are not being
straight with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But such long-term thinking is hardly possible among small
Internet companies scrambling to find revenue that might justify
the values that Wall Street has placed on their stocks. Users are
loath to pay any subscription fees for information on the Internet.
So the money to be made is from selling products or selling ads.
And users are losing interest in small rectangular banner
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than half as many people click on banner ads now than did
so only a year ago, said Michael Golden, a senior vice president
for Organic Media, an online advertising agency, and so Internet
sites are offering other forms of advertising that is more closely
tied to their editorial content.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really competitive, and nobody is making any money, so
people do whatever it takes to survive,'' he said. ``It is
inevitable that online content will be affected by the people who
are paying for it, the advertisers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   The question of what is advertising and what is editorial is
most complicated on popular sites like Yahoo and Excite, which
started simply as ways to search the Internet and have grown to
include a variety of content and services intended to make them
portals to cyberspace. The sites have always maintained that those
searches were objective and that companies could not pay to be
listed first, despite enormous demand.
</P>
<P>
   But where there is demand, it will be filled, especially by
revenue-hungry start-ups. Many search services have started putting
all sorts of links to advertisers above and to the side of the
actual search results.
</P>
<P>
   On Yahoo the line between objective information and advertising
is just that: it is light blue and streaks across its front page.
Below that line is Yahoo's vaunted index of Internet sites,
selected by its staff of surfers, who sometimes also write reviews
of the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Above the line, however, are links to other parts of Yahoo's
service, many of which are run by ``partners,'' meaning sites that
pay a fee to display their wares and often a commission on any
sales that result.
</P>
<P>
   Someone looking to make airplane reservations who clicked on the
Travel entry in the below-the-line index would eventually find a
list of all the online travel services. But if the user's eye was
first caught by the words ``Travel Agent'' above the line, clicking
there would lead to Travelocity, the travel affiliate of AMR Corp.,
which has paid to be the official travel service of Yahoo. (Never
mind that Yahoo's own reviews say that Travelocity's competitor,
Preview Travel, has a better site.)
</P>
<P>
   Do users understand the difference? ``A large majority do,''
argued Tim Brady, Yahoo's vice president for production. ``But it's
tough to do something that everyone clearly understands.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he contended that users would rather have fewer
options and more help _ or as he put it, ``Is it better for us to
display a list of travel services and send people off to fend for
themselves or to work with one to make the travel experience as
good as possible?''
</P>
<P>
   Service to users is the justification used by many news and
information sites that have started placing links from sponsors on
related articles. Many news sites now put an advertisement on each
article offering books from Amazon or Barnes &AMP; Noble related to the
topic of the article. Often a site receives a commission on every
sale. The New York Times has such links on its online book reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The editorial people who write for the book review and work on
it in the electronic area never even consider the advertising
side,'' said Martin A. Nisenholtz, president of The New York Times
Electronic Media Co. ``There is no ambiguity about how the link is
applied within the framework of the site.'' Nonetheless, as The
Times like other news organizations seeks to expand its revenue
from transaction fees, it is developing formal guidelines to ensure
that its journalistic independence is not compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the commercial influence on sites is disclosed, but
indirectly. The local guides produced by Ticketmaster
Online-Citysearch, including the one with The Los Angeles Times,
tell users that restaurants are ranked in order of the size of
their Internet sites. But it does not say that those sites are paid
advertisements on Citysearch, and thus the listings are presented
with the highest bidders first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a bunch of user testing and the consumers preferred to
have the businesses that have the most information come up at the
top,'' said Charles Conn, Citysearch's chief executive, noting that
users can click to reorder the results alphabetically.
</P>
<P>
   There is a similar tilt to advertisers on many sites offering
consumer advice. The problem faced by these sites is that while
they are meant to benefit consumers, their users would not pay for
them.
</P>
<P>
   CompareNet, which means to offer shopping guides to products
ranging from electronics to cars, has decided that its section on
what to buy is independent and objective, but the section on where
to buy is for sale to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not disclose we are getting paid by the retailers in our
where-to-buy section,'' Trevor D. Traina, president of CompareNet,
said. ``Our whole shtick is we just helped you find the perfect
product. We will list every TV set even if we have never spoken to
the manufacturer. Then we will show you a handful of quality
retailers that we stand behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, different standards may apply to sites that offer
independent editorial content and merchants. It is hardly
deceptive, after all, for a store to try to sell its wares. Yet
questions arise as commerce sites become more like magazines, with
Amazon publishing reviews and Garden Escape publishing an extensive
site of horticulture help.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sites like CD Now, a music store, and Cyberian
Outpost, a computer dealer, routinely charge manufacturers to
promote products on their front screens and other prominent parts
of their site. These companies argue they are no different from any
store in the mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it is music or dishwashers, manufacturers often
provide financial incentive for retailers to put their products in
prominent places,'' said Jason Olim, the chief executive of CD Now.
``For us, it's the home page. For the appliance store, it's near
the front door.''
</P>
<P>
   And many media and legal experts say that consumers and commerce
can happily coexist so long as paid links are differentiated from
those that are independently determined.
</P>
<P>
   Jodi Bernstein, director of the Federal Trade Commission's
bureau of consumer protection, which has established a group meant
to watch for deceptive advertising on the Internet, said the agency
wanted to make sure that standards evolve for the Internet as they
have on television or radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be huge complaints about an endorser who
purported to be a doctor and wore a white coat around the neck,''
she said. ``The law would have required them to say as they do now,
`I'm not a doctor, but I'd like to tell you about so and so.'
That's the reason for the Internet group.''
</P>
<P>
   One extreme approach is taken by Goto.com, a search service
started by Bill Gross, the entrepreneur who founded Citysearch. It
favors advertisers in its search result, with the highest bidder
listed first. But there is no question of deception: the amount
paid for each listing is printed on every screen. This is useful,
the service argues, the same way that people sometimes choose to
patronize the plumbers who take out the biggest advertisements in
the yellow pages, presuming them to be most established.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Schuler of America Online argues that the Internet is self
policing and users have shown no desire for either more regulation
or more disclosure. Internet users, especially America Online
members, are quick to yell when they see something they dislike,
and he claims there are few complaints about commercial links on
the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gray area,'' he said, ``is the frontier:
information-supported commerce. You're reading all sorts of
information and recipes about paella, and right there is an
opportunity to buy a paella pan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guiding principle on the frontier is whether a majority of
people find it useful,'' he said. ``If we help people buy the
paella pans they want, we are achieving the potential of the
medium.''

   BISHOP, Calif. _ In winter you can almost wade across the Lower
Owens River. Doesn't that make a drift boat to shuttle anglers down
it overkill?
</P>
<P>
   My doubts were largely reconfirmed after Mammoth Lakes fishing
guide Tom Loe scraped the hull of his aluminum McKenzie-style drift
boat along the gravelly bottom last Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A cold snap had sent the resident rainbows and browns into a
state of lethargy. Casting the heavy sink-tip fly line was a chore
in the face of a stiff wind.
</P>
<P>
   The only action was a beaver that disappeared with the slap of a
tail as we rounded one of the river's many oxbows that can make a
compass schizophrenic. Sure, there was also a hat that blew into
the water and a rare foul in lines in which two anglers' hooks
became enjoined, but to say things were slow is an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   My suspicions began to wane an hour into the seven-hour odyssey
when the first brown, about a foot long, was caught. As the
afternoon water temperature rose enough for the fish to take a more
serious look at our offerings, I warmed to the adventure. A few
minutes after 2 p.m. I boated a 19{-inch, 4\-pound rainbow, my
largest ever fly-fooled trout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you a believer now?'' asked Loe, who in November quit his
commercial pursuits of harpooning swordfish and hook-and-line
rockfishing to open Sierra Drifters Guide Service to guide
full-time.
</P>
<P>
   I was sold.
</P>
<P>
   The colorful size No. 8 spruce-adaptation streamer pattern had
done it's job; meant to mimic a baitfish, the fly proved
irresistible when the line was pulled underwater with short,
irregular strips through the guides on the 9-foot, 5-weight
graphite rod.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever size trout you catch on streamers _ which imitate
sculpin, squawfish, carp and other small prey _ they hit it real
hard, so you think you have Moby Dick on the line,'' said Gary
Gunsolley, a Bishop tackle-shop proprietor who cast a No. 10 olive
Hornberg fly while sharing the boat's bow with me.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliant crimson that defined the fish during the fight had
faded to a mere blush by the time she was returned to her chilly
home. A metal clip on the gill plate designated it as a trophy
trout.
</P>
<P>
   I might not have had a chance to release the fish, let alone
land it, had I been wade-fishing, Gunsolley explained; one surge
from the trout's tail could have pushed it around a bend in the
river, snapping the line. But with the boat's favorable
positioning, the fish was kept closer to the middle of the channel,
tiring sooner from the force of the current.
</P>
<P>
   Wading was not a likely option on this section of the Lower
Owens anyway. The banks are lined with an impossible tangle of
willow, wild rose and tule. Access is further impeded by a lack of
nearby roads.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown tired of failing to navigate the dense brush on
previous excursions, Dana Point stockbroker Bill Sidenfaden
surprised his girlfriend, Kelly Lee, with a Valentine's weekend
trip with Loe's outfit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't hear a person, didn't see a person. The fresh air and
the scenery is spectacular, with the snow-capped Sierra mountains
and the ospreys and all kinds of birds,'' Sidenfaden said of his
recent drift. ``You can see it's a classic fishery, with perfect
water and unpressured hole after unpressured hole.''
</P>
<P>
   While wading on earlier outings, he said, ``I would fish a
section for an hour and then want to move down river, and you can't
because of the brambles. You're stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple put three dozen trout in the boat; Sidenfaden lost
what was thought to be a 7- or 8-pounder in the weeds before any
real battle began. He plans to fish again with Loe in March and
April.
</P>
<P>
   Wind makes casting from the boat difficult, but that's only if
you manage to keep the line out of the bushes on the back cast. The
problem is solved by rollcasting, a relatively simple technique in
which the line is not cast above the angler but instead rolled out
while it lays atop the water.
</P>
<P>
   Loe offered other tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is to stay in contact with the line,
so you can feel the fly through the line and detect a strike,'' he
said. ``By having the rod tip actually in the water you are
minimizing the slack in the line and keeping the fly deeper and
closer to the fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Cast to either side of the foam, which flags the swiftest
current. It is here in the ``neutral zone,'' as Loe calls the slack
water, where the fish hover comfortably, close enough to the main
channel to dart in and grab a meal while expending the least amount
of energy. In winter, when their metabolisms are slow, these trout
need an excuse to move. By bringing the bait to them, dangling a
faux meal just above their maws, logic dictates it might entice a
bite.
</P>
<P>
   The day produced just 10 boated trout, but Gunsolley was happy
with a 16-inch rainbow and I'm still bragging about my prize.
</P>
<P>
   Loe is hoping to buck the odds and sway anglers to target
Eastern Sierra waters in the offseason. Most trout anglers take a
hiatus from traveling Highway 395 from November to late April, when
the bulk of the region is closed to angling. The Lower Owens River
is but one of a handful of fishing holes that are open year-round.
Loe has his work cut out for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a resource here that is 98 percent underutilized in
the winter,'' said Mike Seefeldt, assistant manager of the Mount
Whitney and Black Rock state fish hatcheries to the south.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager living in Bishop in the 1950s, Seefeldt and a
buddy floated and fished the Lower Owens in a pair of
torpedo-shaped airplane fuel tanks that were welded together. ``It
was a real Huck Finn experience,'' he said. ``I grew up in an
environment where what we took from nature supplemented the dinner
table, heavily. We took what we needed _ rainbows and a lot of
browns.''
</P>
<P>
   While the river can still be treacherous and Seefeldt urges
newcomers to be cautious, fishing has changed a lot since then. The
boats are better and catch and release is practiced. But Seefeldt
can't figure why someone didn't think of making a business
enterprise out of drift-fishing the Lower Owens earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised it didn't materialize years ago,'' he said. &QL;

BUSH EXPECTED TO FORM EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush inched closer to a run
for the White House, saying Thursday he will make a ``major
announcement'' in two weeks on a possible campaign for the
Republican presidential nomination next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has sidestepped making a commitment, he continues
to receiving overtures from Republicans pressing the second-term
governor and son of former President George Bush to declare his
candidacy in an increasily crowded field of declared and potential
Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two weeks I'll make an announcement. So I'll see you in two
weeks,'' Bush said, declining again to give any specifics. ``If I
told you what I'd announce, you wouldn't even show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made up my mind to answer the question yes, no or
maybe,'' Bush added.
</P>
<P>
   The ``maybe'' would be an announcement that he is forming an
exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several weeks, people from across the nation have
beaten a path to the Governor's Mansion either to encourage him to
run or advise him on a potential bid. In essence, Bush has been
able to assemble an unofficial team of advisers who could become
part of an official organization.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, he spent several days in Washington where he
was urged by a number of Republican governors to declare his
candidacy. And on Thursday, Alabama Republican leaders urged Bush
to join the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush represents America's best hope for returning
integrity to the White House, tax dollars to working families and
keeping criminals off the streets,'' Alabama Attorney General
William H. Pryor Jr. said in a letter to Bush and signed by a
number of GOP officials from that state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm heartened by the support, needless to say,'' Bush said.
``But I've got a job to do here as governor of Texas. I know that
there's some who are saying, `Why won't he come out and leave the
state?' Because I was elected to do a job, and I intend to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 52, was elected to a second term in November in a
landslide victory. His appeal among minorities and women has made
him a sought-after candidate for Republicans seeking to broaden the
party's constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has insisted time and again that he has not made up his
mind about running, but recently he did acknowledge he is ``warming
to the task.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there seems little doubt in the minds of political observers
that he will announce that he is forming an exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel dead certain that's what he is going to do,'' said
Austin political consultant Bill Miller. ``It will allow him to
establish a structure and more importantly raise the money to
launch his candidacy when he chooses to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suit is being tailored, and when the (legislative) session
is over, he'll put the suit on and run for president,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would continue meeting with various policy people
in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of interest,'' Bush said. ``When my name started
to surface, people started calling in. There seems to be a lot of
interest, genuine interest, obviously which is part of testing the
waters. So we've tried to make time for them to come in.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted those visits haven't interfered with his work here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to allow anything to crowd out the main job I
have, which is governor of the state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The list of advisers includes Stephen Goldsmith, a leading
advocate of privatization; Larry Lindsey, who served on former
President Ronald Reagan's council of economic advisers; and
Condoleezza Rice, former provost of Stanford University and a
family friend.
</P>
<P>
   He also has consulted with former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
and former Secretary of State George Shultz.
</P>
<P>
   Another leading would-be Republican candidate is Elizabeth Dole,
former president of the American Red Cross who campaign vigorously
for her husband, Bob Dole, during his 1996 bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Other likely GOP primary candidates are Lamar Alexander, the
former Tennessee governor; conservative commentator Pat Buchanan;
publisher Steve Forbes; Arizona Sen. John McCain; former Vice
President Dan Quayle; and Christian conservative leader Gary Bauer.

KERRY TO ANNOUNCE HIS INTENTIONS SOON, AIDE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While key advisers still expect Senator John F.
Kerry to announce that he is not running for president, the
Massachusetts Democrat played coy Thursday, saying through an aide
that he was on the verge of making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry plans to make his announcement in Boston as early as
Friday and no later than Monday, said spokesman Jim Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, several of Kerry's most trusted advisers have
said they expect Kerry to end months of speculation by saying he
has decided not to run for president in 2000. But some of the
advisers stressed that despite Kerry's widespread consultations, he
is making up his mind on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, while not providing any indication that Kerry would run,
expressed frustration about widespread speculation that Kerry would
not run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the senator is very close, within days of making an
announcement of his decision about a presidential run,'' Jordan
said. ``Several weeks ago, he set the end of February as a
self-imposed deadline, and he intends to meet that deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kerry doesn't run, it would be because he has determined he
has no chance of beating Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic
nomination, advisers said. But it won't be because of a lack of
money, which originally was one of Kerry's greatest concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Robert B. Crowe, chairman of the Commonwealth Group, was one of
several financial experts who met with Kerry earlier this week to
discuss if the senator could raise enough money to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he could'' raise the money, Crowe said in an
interview, while declining to say whether he advised Kerry to run
for president. ``I do not know what his final decision is, and I
don't think anybody knows but John Kerry.''

TEXAS WHITE SUPREMACIST SENTENCED TO DIE FOR DRAGGING DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
 (fe) 
 By RICK LYMAN 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ After two days of testimony from psychologists,
law-enforcement officials and the killer's weeping father, an East
Texas jury decided on Thursday that the world would be better off
without John William King in it.
</P>
<P>
   The seven men and five women on the jury _ its sole black
member, a corrections officer, acting as foreman _ decided in just
under three hours that the white supremacist should die by lethal
injection for the 1998 murder of James Byrd Jr., a black man, whose
body was torn to pieces when dragged behind a pickup truck down a
rough rural road in the pine woods east of Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any prosecutor who enjoys getting a death penalty has just got
something wrong,'' District Attorney Guy James Gray said. ``You
temper your enthusiasm. But I am proud that my community stood up
and did what was right.''
</P>
<P>
   On his way out of the 110-year-old courthouse, where journalists
and several dozen onlookers awaited the decision on the lawn, King
was jeered by some, with taunts of ``Bye-bye!'' and ``Rot in
hell!'' Asked if he had anything to say to the Byrd family, King
smirked and responded with a vulgarism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't expect him to say, `God bless the Byrd family,'''
said Mary Verrette, one of the murdered man's sisters. ``It just
sums up the total personality of this young man.''
</P>
<P>
   After voting on Tuesday to convict King of capital murder, the
jurors had only two choices left on Thursday: death or life
imprisonment. Under a life sentence, King, 24, could have been
eligible for parole in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Only one white man has ever been executed in Texas for killing a
black person: a farmer who killed another white farmer's favorite
slave in the 1850s. Seven inmates have been executed thus far in
Texas in 1999, bringing the total number of executions in the state
to 171 since the death penalty was reinstated in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   In voting for death, the jury rejected defense arguments that
King would not pose a threat to society if given life in prison and
that the virulent racism that led him to the murder was caused by
the conditions in Texas prisons, where he served a two-year
sentence for burglary in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The foreman, Joe Collins, said the jurors used District Judge
Joe Bob Golden's written instructions to guide them, step by step,
through their deliberations. Each time the judge's instructions
told them they needed to make a decision about the facts, they
talked it out and then voted, until finally they were left with the
ultimate votes of whether to convict and how to punish.
</P>
<P>
   Every single one of the votes, Collins said, was unanimous on
the first try.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence was overwhelming,'' he said. The decisive factor
in going for the death penalty, he said, was an 8-inch homemade
knife that Jasper jail officials recently found in King's cell.
``Obviously, the man still had a lot of hatred in his mind,''
Collins said.

<P>
   ``He showed no signs of remorse for his actions,'' said Karen
Flowers, another juror. ``It's so terribly sad. When I first came
here, I kept looking at him, how young and handsome he is. I have a
son about the same age. I wanted to find something to save him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she said, she could not.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County Sheriff Billy Rowles said King had a rough night
in jail before the decision. ``He was cussing and throwing things
around,'' Rowles said. ``I think probably reality hit him sometime
in the last 24 to 36 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   King, usually a talkative prisoner, was moody and silent on
Thursday on the way to the county courthouse. ``He was not a happy
camper this morning,'' Rowles said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, when his father tearfully begged the jury to spare
his son's life, King had asked to be taken out of the courtroom. He
returned after his father's testimony with red, swollen eyes.
``That was a sign of humanity,'' Ms. Flowers said. ``It was the
first we had seen.''
</P>
<P>
   King was hustled out of town immediately after the sentence was
announced and by early afternoon was already at the James Byrd
Diagnostics Unit _ named for a former warden, unrelated to the
murdered man _ in Huntsville. From there, he will join the other
451 prisoners on Texas' Death Row.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said King, an avowed white supremacist whose arms
and torso are covered with racist tattoos, had killed Byrd, 49, a
man he did not know, after picking him up after midnight on June 7,
1998. With King, prosecutors said, were two other white men:
Lawrence Brewer, 31, whom King met in prison, and Shawn Berry, 23,
whom King has known since high school. Trial dates for the other
two have not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   King, who had joined a racist group called the Confederate
Knights of America while in prison, had written his own
constitution and bylaws for a chapter he hoped to start in Jasper,
to be called the Texas Rebel Soldiers. The murder of Byrd,
prosecutors said, was to bind the three white men together and to
gain enough attention to attract more members to their group.
</P>
<P>
   The trio picked up Byrd, who was walking home from a party and
was partially intoxicated and drove him to a remote area east of
town where he was beaten. Chains were tied around his ankles and he
was dragged behind Berry's pick-up truck for about three miles,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   A pathologist testified that Byrd had been alive and probably
conscious until he hit a roadside culvert that sheared his body in
two.
</P>
<P>
   The elder King had been present for all of his son's trial but
decided on Thursday he was not up to staying to hear the sentence.
Instead, early Thursday morning, the father and son were allowed a
moment together in the courthouse. The Rev. Ron Foshage, pastor of
St. Michael's Catholic Church in Jasper, accompanied the father to
the meeting but stayed out of earshot.
</P>
<P>
   He said the father and son embraced and talked quietly together
for a few moments. ``I think both of them know it was probably the
last time they would have physical contact with one another,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After the death sentence was announced, Foshage read a statement
from the elder King.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please pray for the Byrd family who have endured unimaginable
pain and loss,'' he read. ``Please pray for these jurors who have
shouldered a terrible burden. Please pray for our town of Jasper, a
community that remains strong though scarred by this unspeakable
act.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger King also left a written statement behind as he was
taken away to prison. Neatly written on lined paper and handed to
his lawyers, it read: ``Though I remain adamant about my innocence,
it's been obvious from the beginning that this community would get
what they desire; so I'll close with the words of Francis Yockey:
``The promise of success is with the man who is determined to die
proudly when it is no longer possible to live proudly.''' It was
signed, ``Sincerely, John W. King.''
</P>
<P>
   Yockey was a pro-Nazi writer who died in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors, meanwhile, said they were simply trying to do their
job and render a fair verdict, not to send any statement to the
world. They were just ``common citizens who felt going on the jury
was an obligation, not a privilege,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the selection of Collins, the sole black juror, as foreman
had not been intended as a message to the world, Ms. Flowers said,
though she knew that many would take it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe was just one of us, that's it,'' she said. ``We got in
there and kind of stumbled around and nobody wanted to do the job
and Joe volunteered to do it. It was never any statement. We never
looked at Joe as a black man. He's just a fine man.''

 &HT;    Path untaken: ASA mulled buying AirTran, filing says
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before agreeing to a buyout by longtime partner Delta
Air Lines, Atlantic Southeast Airlines weighed alternatives that
included buying AirTran Airways, a regulatory filing shows.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of a low-fare carrier called ``Asteroid'' _ a
code name for AirTran _ is listed as one of the strategies
Atlanta-based ASA might have launched had it spurned Delta's bid.
</P>
<P>
   That and other ``strategic alternatives'' are disclosed in a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Delta's $34-a-share
tender offer for the 72 percent of ASA Holdings it doesn't already
own.
</P>
<P>
   There's no indication any of the options, which also included
mergers with other regional airlines, was ever pursued. They are
presented only as theoretical scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   ASA's board also considered rejecting the tender offer and
standing pat as a partially owned affiliate, the filing shows. In
the end, it decided taking Delta's bid was the best option.
</P>
<P>
   Filing shows that decision came under intense pressure from
Delta, which proposed the buyout in late January. At the same time,
it was demanding changes in the two carriers' existing partnership
that would cut ASA revenue and profits if it stayed independent.
</P>
<P>
   Delta used those prospective cuts to justify a bid price that
included only a slight premium over current trading levels for ASA
stock, which closed Thursday at $33.12 1/2, down 12 1/2 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was either accept a $34 bid or watch the stock go to $20''
after the changes took effect, PaineWebber analyst Sam Buttrick
said.
</P>
<P>
   The $700 million tender offer was announced Feb. 16. If a
majority of shareholders approve by March 19, ASA will become a
Delta subsidiary. On Thursday, Delta said it got notice from
federal regulators they won't raise antitrust objections.
</P>
<P>
   ASA spokesman Sam Watts declined to comment on the Asteroid
option, other than to confirm the carrier's board ``did look at
potential alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   One was the purchase of Asteroid, described in the SEC filing as
an unprofitable low-fare airline with a strong presence on
Concourse C at Hartsfield International Airport. AirTran, which
shares Concourse C with ASA, is the only airline fitting that
description.
</P>
<P>
   A combined ASA-Asteroid would control an entire Hartsfield
concourse, the filing notes. Also, ASA would retain control over
deployment of its highly profitable new regional jets _ one of
several issues creating tension with Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Obvious disadvantages, however, also were noted. Chiefly, ASA
would be saddled with Asteroid's poor balance sheet and its
low-fare passenger base, diminishing its profitability and stock
price outlook. Also, the carriers have dissimilar fleets and
operations, and it was unclear how they would be combined.
</P>
<P>
   The filing gives no indication there was ever any discussion
between ASA and Asteroid. But there are personal links among
directors and executives of ASA and AirTran.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Priddy, who founded AirTran forerunner ValuJet and sits
on AirTran's board, was a co-founder of ASA, along with George
Pickett and John Beiser, who have remained as its top executives.
They'll leave after the Delta buyout closes.
</P>
<P>
   ASA's other alternatives included merging with another regional
carrier, dubbed ``Star,'' or offering itself for sale to one called
``Comet.'' Evidence in the filing suggests those are actually
SkyWest and Comair, respectively, Delta affiliates in other parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   By combining with them, ASA would gain greater leverage in
dealings with Delta, the filing said. But either deal also carried
serious drawbacks for shareholders, it added.
</P>
<P>
   Delta and ASA have been allies since 1984, when Delta first
contracted with ASA for connecting flights from its Atlanta hub.
ASA has a strong financial record _ stronger than Delta's,
historically _ but has suffered service and staffing problems since
the mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Delta said in the SEC filings it began reevaluating affiliate
relations in 1997, with an eye toward changing certain aspects of
its contract with ASA. Ongoing discussions over those issues and
service problems culminated in the buyout bid last month.
</P>
<P>
   By taking full ownership, Delta will not only gain control of
ASA service and schedules, it also will boost its own bottom line
by absorbing ASA's higher profit margins, and it will gain access
to ASA's Hartsfield gates. Some observers think those are bigger
factors than service problems, which ASA had largely repaired by
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   The filing shows Delta leaned hard on ASA to sell. For instance,
just before it first pitched the buyout, Delta threatened to
replace ASA on certain routes from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Delta renewed an effort to change the formula used
to divvy up revenue from the 80 percent of ASA passengers who
connect from Delta flights. The changes would cut ASA's annual
revenue by up to $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single message that comes through from this deal is that
Delta is going to be much more aggressive and proactive in managing
regional partner relations,'' said analyst Buttrick. ``To a certain
extent, the message is, `No more Mr. Nice Guy.'''
</P>
<P>
   SkyWest and Comair, Delta's other two primary affiliates, remain
partly owned by Delta. Some analysts wonder about the future of
those relationships and whether Delta will try to bring all of its
affiliates under an umbrella subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll see how it goes with ASA first,'' Buttrick predicted.
``I do not expect anything more from them in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   The filings confirmed that Delta plans to install John
Selvaggio, a recent hire who previously ran US Airways' commuter
division, as chief executive of the ASA subsidiary, replacing
Pickett and Beiser.
</P>
<P>
   Two other top ASA executives, finance chief Ronald Sapp and
operations chief Ed Paquette, will remain in those roles.

 &HT;    FCC ruling makes per-minute charges for Internet possible
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A ruling Thursday by the Federal Communications
Commission throws open the door for per-minute charges for Internet
users and threatens current offerings of unlimited access to the
Net for a flat monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators ruled that dial-up Internet connections are
long-distance even when made through a local number. FCC officials
Thursday said they will now start considering how those charges
should be assessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision has the potential to change the pricing model
that we've seen in the last few years,'' said Jeff Kagan, an
Atlanta-based telecommunications analyst. ``This is a big decision
that should keep everything tied in knots for months longer.''
</P>
<P>
   While the FCC decision would directly affect only what phone
companies pay each other for Internet traffic, many Internet
Service Providers buy lines from upstart phone companies competing
with big regional companies like BellSouth. If the upstarts lose
out on profit, they may have to raise their rates to the ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This threat is that Internet Service Providers could be in the
position where they cannot offer flat rates,'' said Peter Lucht,
spokesman for MCI WorldCom, the giant telecommunications and
Internet company. ``Then the ISP must either pass on the costs or
find another form of revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   FCC members have so far shown no inclination to chill the Net _
and they know that predictable, reasonable rates spur consumers to
log on. Moreover, the political danger of using regulation to
strangle the Net's growth makes the FCC unlikely to set a tough
rate scheme, said Dave Baker, vice president of MindSpring
Enterprises, the region's largest Internet Service Provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can sum this up in two words: don't panic,'' he said. ``This
just shouldn't affect what consumers pay to use the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   But local communications are for state regulators to monitor,
and the FCC also seems eager to keep a handle on the nation's
fastest growing medium.
</P>
<P>
   Most users of the Net now use a computer modem that dials the
local number of an Internet service provider (ISP). After that _
depending on what the user wants _ the signal could be routed to a
computer server anywhere in the United States or around the world.
</P>
<P>
   To the user, it only matters that he or she can get to the Net
and surf indefinitely without worrying about the kind of per-minute
charges that pile up on a long-distance voice call. That is
possible because users are charged for a local call only _ and most
get unlimited local calling along with their monthly fee to the
phone company.
</P>
<P>
   All calls and connections _ voice and Net _ depend on agreements
between the various phone companies that handle the transmissions.
Those agreements generally include a provision for companies to pay
each other when they transfer local calls: The calling company pays
the one that takes the call.
</P>
<P>
   Big regional phone companies like BellSouth have been arguing
all along that calls to the Internet are long-distance. That's
because the law says that when they pass along a local call from
one of their customers to another local phone company, they have to
pay the other company. With voice calls, that rule seemed likely to
mean that both companies paid each other about the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the payments are called reciprocal compensation. But
Internet calls tend to be one-way only. The Net customer dials an
ISP _ not the other way around. And since regional companies still
have a near-stranglehold on the residential market, they are nearly
always on the wrong end of the compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the Net calls are not local, regional companies
have not paid reciprocal compensation. For $23 billion-a-year
BellSouth, that means holding back several $100 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   For ICG Communications, whose revenue is $300 million, the
amount is a lot more important, said Cindy Schonhaut, executive
vice president. The Denver-based company offers a variety of
services, including local service in competition with various
regional companies, and is owed reciprocal compensation of about
$60 million, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 29 states, the public utility commissions have sided with the
competitive local exchange companies like ICG against the Bells.
The FCC Thursday ruled that current contracts between phone
companies must be honored. To BellSouth's rivals, that means
BellSouth should pay the compensation, but a quick payment by the
Bells is not expected. ``I wish they would respond by writing
checks,'' Schonhaut said. ``I think they'll respond by
litigating.''
</P>
<P>
   That expectation seemed bolstered by Bill Barfield, BellSouth's
associate general counsel, who said the company does not see the
FCC order as a mandate to pay what competitors say they are owed.
</P>
<P>
   ``BellSouth's position has always been clear: calls to the
Internet are interstate in nature. With the FCC's decision, they
are interstate now. And they were interstate when BellSouth signed
interconnection agreements with competitors. BellSouth must examine
the FCC's order in detail. With the inescapable logic of this
ruling, BellSouth has a strong legal basis for not paying
per-minute compensation for calls that terminate on the Internet.

CRUISE LINE IS INDICTED IN OIL-DUMPING CASE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATT: Ala., Calif., N.Y.)   (rk) 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal grand jury in Los Angeles has indicted
Royal Caribbean Cruises on charges of making false statements to
the Coast Guard about oily waste discharges in 1994. Similar
charges are expected in the coming weeks in Alaska and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The three-count indictment returned late Wednesday said crew
members aboard the company's Nordic Prince presented records
covering up illegal discharges of oily waste into the ocean during
three Coast Guard inspections in Los Angeles from January to
October 1994. Each count carries a maximum fine of $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Royal Caribbean pleaded guilty in Miami and San Juan
to similar charges covering the same time period involving five of
its ships, including the Nordic Prince. As part of the plea
agreement, the company paid $9 million in fines and agreed to
institute new environmental compliance programs aboard all of its
ships.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement did not insulate the world's second-largest cruise
company from potential charges in other federal jurisdictions
because prosecutors said that Royal Caribbean did not cooperate
fully. As a result, a company official acknowledged Thursday,
indictments are also expected in Alaska and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean officials said the company had already
acknowledged the illegal practices from 1990 to 1994, bought new
equipment and introduced extensive monitoring and compliance
programs. ``As we have said before, these acts were wrong and are
totally inexcusable,'' Jack Williams, the company president, said.
``We are doing everything we can to operate our ships above and
beyond compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges to which Royal Caribbean pleaded guilty last June
represented the largest criminal case of ocean pollution ever and
focused attention on difficulties in regulating the fast-growing
cruise industry.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean and the other major cruise companies are foreign
corporations and their ships fly foreign flags, leading to
questions about the jurisdiction of the U.S. authorities in
environmental cases and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean's lawyers had argued that the company was not
required to provide records to the Coast Guard because it is a
Liberian corporation. A judge rejected the argument and the company
pleaded guilty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both the old and new charges stem from dumping contaminated
water directly into the ocean. On any ship, oil drips from
machinery and collects along with seawater in the bilges.
Environmental regulations require ships to operate a device known
as an oily water separator to filter the oil out of the water. The
oil is stored on board while the cleansed water is discharged into
the ocean. Each time the separator operates, the results are to be
recorded in an oil record book.
</P>
<P>
   The Nordic Prince, which was later sold, was one of five Royal
Caribbean ships equipped in the early 1990s with makeshift pipes to
bypass the oil water separator and dump contaminated bilge water
directly overboard. The record books were falsified to show that
the waste was filtered before its discharge and then presented to
the Coast Guard in Los Angeles and elsewhere in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean acknowledged falsifying the books and lying
about the bypass systems in its two guilty pleas last June.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers said Royal Caribbean's failure to
turn over its complete files on the earlier incidents required
bringing charges in separate jurisdictions to discover the full
extent of the dumping violations.

KERRY TO ANNOUNCE HIS INTENTIONS SOON, AIDE SAYS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While key advisers still expect Senator John F.
Kerry to announce that he is not running for president, the
Massachusetts Democrat played coy Thursday, saying through an aide
that he was on the verge of making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry plans to make his announcement in Boston as early as
Friday and no later than Monday, said spokesman Jim Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, several of Kerry's most trusted advisers have
said they expect Kerry to end months of speculation by saying he
has decided not to run for president in 2000. But some of the
advisers stressed that despite Kerry's widespread consultations, he
is making up his mind on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, while not providing any indication that Kerry would run,
expressed frustration about widespread speculation that Kerry would
not run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the senator is very close, within days of making an
announcement of his decision about a presidential run,'' Jordan
said. ``Several weeks ago, he set the end of February as a
self-imposed deadline, and he intends to meet that deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kerry doesn't run, it would be because he has determined he
has no chance of beating Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic
nomination, advisers said. But it won't be because of a lack of
money, which originally was one of Kerry's greatest concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Robert B. Crowe, chairman of the Commonwealth Group, was one of
several financial experts who met with Kerry earlier this week to
discuss if the senator could raise enough money to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he could'' raise the money, Crowe said in an
interview, while declining to say whether he advised Kerry to run
for president. ``I do not know what his final decision is, and I
don't think anybody knows but John Kerry.''

GROUP MAY PROBE DRUG STUDIES OF MENTALLY ILL 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine, a leading US health policy group, is
seriously considering launching a review of controversial studies
that induce psychotic symptoms or withdraw medication in people
with mental illness, a top official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we are very interested in trying to be helpful
on,'' said Susanne Stoiber, executive officer of the private
nonprofit institute, created to serve as a health policy adviser
under a congressional charter granted to the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's interest coincides with a recommendation that
the institute review the studies, made in November by a
presidentially appointed bioethics commission. In making that
recommendation, the commission cited a Globe series highlighting
the ethical concerns raised by the research.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the growing concern, Stoiber said, ``In the next
year, I expect we will be undertaking some work on this subject,''
both on the psychosis-inducing and medication-withdrawal studies,
as well as on the broader ethical questions raised by research
involving people with mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   The institute is a kind of scientific high court, which the
federal government and private foundations contract with to examine
some of the most controversial health policy issues of the day.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, next month the institute is scheduled to weigh in
on the medical use of marijuana, and has just appointed a committee
to tackle the issue of how organs are allocated to patients at
different academic transplant centers.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics of the research questioned whether the
institute, also known as IOM, is the right organization to review
the psychosis-inducing and medication-withdrawal studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't in any way be even a semblance of independent
investigation,'' said Vera Hassner Sharav, president and co-founder
of the Citizens for Care in Psychiatry and Research, a leading
critic of such studies. ``That is so cynical. The very people who
conduct these kinds of illness-exacerbation experiments are members
of the IOM.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoiber and another IOM official defended the institute's
process for protecting the objectivity of its reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way IOM approaches any study is to create a committee or
study panel that is expert in the subject area but does not in fact
have any people on it whose personal research or financial
interests are at stake in the outcome of the study,'' Stoiber said.
For instance, the new IOM committee looking at organ allocation
does not include transplant surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we spend a lot of time composing our committees to achieve
that result, bringing together scientists and experts from a number
of fields, whose views would be important in terms of having a
balanced overall look at the issue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Bonnie, a member of IOM's board of neuroscience and
behavioral health and a University of Virginia law professor, said,
``The key about an IOM study is its independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Another potential hurdle to having the institute do the review,
however, is that it relies on outside funding for its comprehensive
reports, which range in cost from $400,000 to $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   While the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC)
recommended in its report to President Clinton that the US
Department of Health and Human Services contract with the
institute, Stoiber said the institute has not yet been contacted.
</P>
<P>
   The institute feels strongly enough about the topic that if
administration officials do not express interest, it would seek
funding elsewhere for a review at least of the broader ethical
questions of testing the mentally ill, if not of the narrower
issues of psychosis-inducing and medication-withdrawal studies.
``If (administration officials) feel that they are not ready to do
this, or that they don't agree with the NBAC recommendations. . .
,'' Stoiber said, the institute ``would talk with private sponsors
to see whether or not we could gather support for a study without
government participation.''
</P>
<P>
   While the question of psychosis-inducing and
medication-withdrawal studies also deserves an in-depth inquiry,
she said it might be more difficult to interest a private funder in
such a specific topic.
</P>
<P>
   Another funding possibility would be to have Congress request
the study and appropriate the money, Stoiber said. That is what
happened with the contract to study organ allocation, ``an even
more politically charged issue'' than the psychosis-inducing and
medication-withdrawal studies, she said.

BACTERIA'S ROLE IN HEART DISEASE DISCOVERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists believe they have discovered how a common bacterial
infection can trigger heart disease _ a controversial hypothesis
that is generating enormous interest among heart researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The key finding, reported in the current Science, is that
chlamydia bacteria, which cause lung and eye infections and a
sexually transmitted disease, have a protein on their outer coat
that mimics a protein found in the heart muscle of mammals.
</P>
<P>
   Normally this molecular mimicry allows the bacterium to evade
the chlamydia-infected individual's immune system. But sometimes
the immune cells are not fooled; they mount an attack against the
chlamydia germs that gets misdirected against heart cells as if
they were the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we now see is that we don't have to have bacterial damage
to the heart'' in order for bacteria to cause heart disease, said
Dr. Josef M. Penninger of the University of Toronto, who led the
research team.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Canadian researchers' experiments involved mice,
Penninger said there is good reason to believe the same mechanism
may explain at least some human heart disease. The heart muscle
protein that chlamydia mimics is identical in mice and men.
</P>
<P>
   Several previous studies have suggested a connection between
chlamydia infections and human heart disease. However, these
studies were epidemiological _ based on associations between the
disease and the prior incidence of infection _ and could not
suggest a mechanism to explain the link.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, chlamydia infections are very common; at least two out
of three adults have antibody evidence of a past infection. Since
heart disease is also common, it has been impossible to know from
epidemiology alone if the two diseases were really linked.
</P>
<P>
   Boston University researchers reported earlier this month that
British patients who had been treated with certain antibiotics were
less likely to develop heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Two large human studies are underway to see if antibiotic
treatment will prevent heart attacks among individuals who have
already survived one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even some of those who believe that infections may play a
role in heart disease remain unconvinced. ``The epidemiologic
studies have not clearly linked the two together,'' said Dr. Paul
Ridker of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who studies the
role of inflammation in heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   A study of chlamydia's role in heart disease, conducted by
Ridker and his colleagues and due for publication next month,
failed to find a link between prior chlamydia infection and later
heart problems. Neither was chlamydia infection associated with
certain markers of inflammation that Ridker has found in heart
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ridker called the Toronto findings ``very
intriguing'' and said they were generating a lot of talk among
those in the field. ``Any open-minded scientist has to be excited
by this type of data,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the Toronto results, it appears that the immune misfire
triggered by chlamydia can cause different sorts of heart damage _
both the common artery-clogging disease that leads to heart attacks
and the heart enlargement called cardiomyopathy that is the leading
reason for heart transplants in younger individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments, Penninger said, reveal thickening of the
cardiac arteries in mice infected with chlamydia as well as
arterial deposits of fibrin, a substance found in blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   Other experiments not yet reported found that chlamydia-infected
mice that were followed for longer periods of time developed
cardiomyopathy. Penninger said, ``This is quite remarkably similar
to the human situation.''

ISRAELI COURT BARS EXTRADITION OF MARYLAND YOUTH CHARGED WITH
MURDER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli Supreme Court ruled Thursday that an
American Jewish teen-ager who was charged with murder in Maryland
should not be extradited because he is an Israeli citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-2 decision means that the 18-year-old youth, Samuel
Sheinbein, who fled to Israel after the killing, will be tried in
an Israeli court despite pressure for his extradition from the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
   Sheinbein fled in September 1997, two days after the dismembered
and burned body of an acquaintance, 19-year-old Alfredo Enrique
Tello Jr., was found in a garage in a Maryland suburb of
Washington. Sheinbein was later indicted in the slaying. To avoid
extradition, Sheinbein, who never lived in Israel, claimed Israeli
citizenship through his father, who immigrated to the United States
in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Sheinbein appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court after the
Jerusalem District Court ruled last year that he should be
extradited despite his citizenship because he had not lived in
Israel and had not maintained close ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's ruling, the court said that ``no further affinity
with Israel is required for the appellant to be considered an
Israeli citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1978 Israeli law, citizens of Israel cannot be
extradited to stand trial abroad. The law reflected the view that
Jews should not be handed over to gentile courts, where they might
face an unfair trial.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department and Attorney General Janet Reno expressed
disappointment with the ruling, which overturned a decision by a
lower court.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended the ruling, saying:
``Israel, as you know, is a state of law, and in a state of law the
interpreter of the law is the Supreme Court, whose decision we must
honor. I'm sure that the United States, which is also a state of
law, understands this.''
</P>
<P>
   David Libai, Sheinbein's lawyer, said, ``The Supreme Court
proved its independence by signaling that that it does not yield to
pressures from the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Maryland pressed for the extradition of
Sheinbein, who was later indicted in Montgomery County, Md. His
suspected accomplice, Aaron Needle, 18, hanged himself with a
bedsheet in a Maryland jail last April.
</P>
<P>
   Most European countries also do not extradite their citizens,
but this is not the practice in Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Writing the majority opinion, Justice Theodor Orr noted that the
Israeli law contradicted extradition treaties with the United
States and other countries, and he urged that it be amended. But he
added that as long as the law was in force, it must be upheld. A
bill to amend the law is pending in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Israeli Justice Ministry said Sheinbein would
be indicted for murder at the Tel Aviv District Court as early as
next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice will be done because the youth will be tried in
Israel,'' said Irit Kohn, director of the ministry's international
department. ``He's not getting up and going, but he is being tried
for murder, which is a very serious offense, and we will explain
this to our American colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas Gansler, the Montgomery County prosecutor, remained
unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been our position and remains our position that
Sheinbein is a citizen of the United States,'' Gansler said in
Maryland. ``Sheinben was born, raised, went to school and lived
here his entire life, and only took a few vacations to Israel.
Sheinbein's guilt or innocence should be adjudicated here, and he
should be held accountable here.''
</P>
<P>
   The murder victim's mother, Eliette Ramos, urged Americans to
lobby Congress for the extradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very upset and disappointed with the Israel government
and the judiciary system,'' Ms. Ramos said. ``Each American should
be very concerned, outraged and angry at this outcome. I personally
will not rest in peace with this decision. How can the United
States government provide billions of dollars to Israel if they do
not support the U.S. treaty?''

DEVELOPER KARP AGREES TO SELL 14 REGIONAL MALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Taking advantage of a strong economy and rapid
consolidation in the mall industry, local developer Stephen R. Karp
agreed Thursday to sell off a big chunk of his mall operations to
the nation's largest mall owner, Simon Property Group, for $1.725
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would make Indianapolis-based Simon New England's
dominant mall owner.
</P>
<P>
   After his New England Development Co. completes the sale of a
portfolio of 14 regional malls to Simon, Karp said NED will turn
its focus to developing projects in South Boston's Seaport
District, on New Haven's waterfront, in Plymouth, Mass., and in
suburban Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   While all these projects will have a retail component, several
also include plans for hotels, offices, and condominiums. In that
respect, they are different from the type of shopping malls Karp
helped build in the 1970's and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that Karp, 58, was looking to cash
out his mall empire so he could help the Red Sox build a new
stadium to replace Fenway Park. But Karp dismissed such talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really nothing to say'' about the Red Sox, he said.
``I haven't had any recent conversations with them. It's not the
reason for the transaction (with Simon).''
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for Simon _ which owns or has interests in 243
mall properties in the United States _ to assume management
responsibilities from NED's affiliated company, WellsPark
Management LLC.
</P>
<P>
   As for the timing of the proposed transaction, Karp cited the
robust economy and the maturity of the regional mall business.
</P>
<P>
   David Flick, an analyst with Legg Mason Wood Walker who follows
Simon, noted that malls commanded higher sales prices a year ago,
but added, ``You can never time the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen months ago, Karp attempted to merge his malls with those
of the Richard E. Jacobs Group of Cleveland with the idea of taking
the combined company public, but that deal collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier attempt at a merger between Jacobs, Karp and a third
company fell through when 12 malls run by the third company were
purchased for a premium price by Simon.
</P>
<P>
   Karp's willingness to sell may reflect a rapidly changing retail
landscape. After 50 years of expansion, America is saturated with
malls. There is little space left to build them, and no great
demand for new ones.
</P>
<P>
   As the century draws to a close, many consumers are squeezed for
time. In the name of convenience, some have abandoned big malls to
do more of their shopping at smaller strip malls, which are easier
to get in and out of. Some consumers have even turned to Internet
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Convenience is everything,'' and today's consumer is spending
less time at large malls, noted Kathleen Seiders, a professor of
retail at Babson College.
</P>
<P>
   While Karp's malls last year had one of their best holiday
seasons of the 1990s, shopping trends suggest big malls may be at
or near their peak.
</P>
<P>
   For small privately owned companies, ``regional malls are a
one-generation business,'' said Karp, who developed his first mall
in 1972, the Liberty Tree Mall in Danvers. ``Now the public
companies are buying up the local regionals.''
</P>
<P>
   Just because 1999 may be a good time for Karp to switch his
focus from traditional malls to mixed-use development projects,
that doesn't mean Simon is making an unwise acquisition, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Big mall companies such as Simon have been consolidating rapidly
since the early 1990s when real estate investment trusts began
attracting the attention of Wall Street, said John Konarski, vice
president for research for the International Council of Shopping
Centers. As a result, big publicly owned REITS, with Simon in the
lead, have been snapping up small privately owned mall companies in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   With few opportunities to build new malls, mall REITS have to
achieve growth mostly through acquisitions, Konarski said.
</P>
<P>
   With their size, REITS can squeeze more efficiencies out of a
mall than a smaller owner. In addition, big REITs can use their
muscle to negotiate more favorable rents from big retail chains.
</P>
<P>
   For Simon, the proposed deal with Karp is an opportunity to bulk
up its presence in New England by adding such properties as
Northshore Mall in Peabody and Square One Mall in Saugus to a
portfolio that already includes the Burlington Mall and South Shore
Plaza in Braintree.
</P>
<P>
   That would give Simon just about every major regional mall in
Greater Boston except Natick Mall and the Mall at Chestnut Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Simon will have ``an incredibly dominant position'' in the local
marketplace, said Brian Kavoogian, managing director of the Boston
office of Holliday Fenoglio Fowler, an investment banking firm that
provides financing to malls, including Karp's.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing a widely held view, Kavoogian said, ``Steve Karp's
malls are viewed as some of the best in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In the world of REITs, Simon's reputation is also impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simon is the big gorilla in this market,'' analyst Fick said.
Simon will be ``nearly four times the size of its nearest
competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of NED's malls were not included in the transaction _
CambridgeSide Galleria, Worcester Common Outlets, and Pheasant Lane
Mall in New Hampsire.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the malls in NED's portfolio are partly owned by other
investors. And in the case of CambridgeSide and Pheasant Lane, an
agreement could not be reached on the sale to Simon. As an outlet
mall, Worcester does not fit Simon's portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Karp held out the possibility that CambridgeSide and Pheasant
Lane could be sold at a later date, possibly to Simon.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the transaction, Karp will be invited to join the
Simon board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why Karp was willing to sell to Simon is that part of
his payment would come in the form of partnership shares that would
allow Karp to defer paying taxes on the capital gains, sources told
The Boston Globe earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts told Bloomberg News Simon is in talks with J.P. Morgan
Investment Management Inc. and its pension fund clients about
forming a venture to complete the buy.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bloomberg, Simon will pay for the transaction with
$200 million of equity; J.P. Morgan will provide $500 million and
the venture will assume $995 million of debt.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Simon's shares closed unchanged
at 25 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Karp and his family have extensive investments on Nantucket.
They own a marina and such hotels as the Wauwinet, White Elephant
and the Harbor House. Those family investments are not a part of
NED, Karp said.

U.S. PRESSES CHINA TO BACK CONTINUED U.N. ROLE IN MACEDONIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States and its principal allies are
pressing China to allow the U.N. peacekeeping force in Macedonia to
continue operating for at least a few more weeks, despite Beijing's
veto of a resolution Thursday extending the force's mandate.
</P>
<P>
   The vote in the 15-member Security Council was 13 in favor of a
six-month extension, with China opposed and Russia abstaining. The
negative vote by China, which as a permanent council member has
veto power, was sufficient to block continuation of the
peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said they effectively want China to reverse
its veto before the mandate's expiration Sunday, when the
peacekeeping force will be obliged to stop patrolling Macedonia's
borders with Albania and the troubled province of Kosovo in Serbia
and preventing illicit arms across the borders. But this would
require a new Security Council vote by this weekend with China
voting in favor or at least abstaining.
</P>
<P>
   China's action apparently came in retaliation for Macedonia's
diplomatic recognition of Taiwan in January in return for a
reported gift of $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said they saw the peacekeeping force's
continuation as important to their efforts to promote stability in
the Balkans and did not want its operations interrupted before they
have had time to devise alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Those could include turning the task over to NATO or another
coalition of like-minded countries. But such a force would lack the
prestige of a Security Council mandate and would not be financed by
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, these diplomats said, Chinese officials have
rejected any such compromise and are threatening another veto if
other council members propose even a limited extension of the
mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Defending Thursday's veto, China's representative to the United
Nations, Qin Huasun, made no allusion to Beijing's dispute with
Macedonia over Taiwan. Instead, he said the peacekeepers were no
longer needed because the situation in Macedonia ``has apparently
stabilized in the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other Council members expressed regret that China was
endangering efforts to promote stability in a severely troubled
part of the world.

SENATE PANEL CONSIDERS HOLDING OLYMPIC HEARINGS 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Senate committee is considering whether to hold
hearings into the Olympics bribery scandal, a proceeding that could
lead to financially crippling sanctions against organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican who chairs the Senate
Commerce Committee, is expected to decide Monday whether hearings
should be held into $1.2 million in enticements Salt Lake City's
Olympics organizers used to lure the 2002 Winter Games to Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympics Committee, based in Switzerland,
already is reeling after an independent ethics panel found that 24
of the IOC's 114 members accepted cash payoffs, lavish gifts,
university scholarships and paid holidays.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been consulting with Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska and a
Commerce Committee member, about the possibility of hearings and
what kind of penalties Congress might levy.
</P>
<P>
   Among the options open to lawmakers are fines, taking away
revenue from broadcast rights or lifting the International Olympic
Committee's tax-exempt status. The latter would hamstring the
committee, since nine of the IOC's 11 worldwide sponsors are U.S.
firms that reduce their tax burdens through tax-exempt donations to
the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to avoid them (sanctions) at all cost, but we want
people to understand that they're possible,'' Stevens said. ``It's
essential that confidence be maintained and that the integrity of
the system for the benefit of the athletes be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing a role in McCain's decision, an aide said, will be a
report from the U.S. Olympic Committee's ethics oversight
commission, led by former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell.
The Mitchell commission, appointed by the USOC in December, is
expected to issue its report Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hampered by the lack of subpoena power and key figures' fears of
criminal liability if they talked, the Mitchell commission report
is expected to contain no major revelations, but will pin the major
blame for the Salt Lake scandal on a small circle of local bid
committee officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service already
are investigating the scandal. Congress' General Accounting Office
is looking at how taxpayer funds are being used for roads, mass
transit and other infrastructure improvements linked to the Salt
Lake City Games and whether local organizers benefited personally
from the federally financed projects.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC also has conducted a probe of the Salt Lake City
scandal. To date four IOC members have resigned, five have been
suspended, three are under investigation and one has received a
warning.

UNION LEADERS VOTED OUT AT SATURN PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Mich.)  (mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ All of the local union leaders who made General
Motors' Saturn one of the nation's most prominent experiments in
labor relations have been voted out of office by union members, who
chose new leaders who have advocated a more traditional and less
close relationship with management.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp. set up Saturn in Tennessee in 1986 in an
effort to create a car company with labor relations that would be
less rancorous and more cooperative. For the last 13 years, the
local Saturn union had been led by Michael Bennett, who frequently
defied the national leadership of the United Automobile Workers
union by linking pay to productivity and encouraging workers to
participate in a wide range of decisions with management.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and his entire slate of other union officials were
defeated in elections on Wednesday, according to results that
became official late Wednesday and were confirmed Thursday by union
officials. Replacing Bennett will be Robert Williams, a vice
president of the local union and a critic of current labor
relations at Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists in labor relations have come from around the world
to study and praise Saturn's experiment at its 7,000-employee
factory in Spring Hill, Tenn. But many of the workers have
increasingly felt that they were making too many concessions to
management, like irregular workweeks that included work on
Saturdays without overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   Workers' anger boiled over last summer when a strike at two GM
parts factories in Flint, Mich., forcd the closing of almost all
of GM's assembly plants in North America. The Saturn assembly plant
remained open then because the local union leadership agreed to let
GM use parts from other companies, including Japanese spark plugs.
</P>
<P>
   The factory's membership voted for the first time ever then to
authorize a strike but never walked out.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who won this week's election, was the only local union
official who, in a union vote two years ago, advocated ending the
existing labor contract at Saturn and replacing it with the
national UAW agreement in force at every other GM factory in the
United States. Williams, who goes by the nickname ``Jeep,'' won
55.5 percent of the vote at Saturn's factory, while Bennett
received 38.6 percent. Two other candidates had the rest of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   In this week's election, Williams and his fellow candidates did
not call for replacing the Saturn contract. But they did say that
Saturn should stop linking pay to productivity and should adopt
many work rules from other GM factories.
</P>
<P>
   The vote comes at a particularly difficult time for GM. Local
union elections are usually held in late spring, but Bennett called
early elections this year because the local union must decide what
concessions to offer GM in exchange for a corporate commitment to
build a car-based sport utility vehicle there in two years. Now, GM
is likely to face a series of union demands even as it seeks
promises of further improvements in productivity.
</P>
<P>
   In another, apparently coincidental setback for Saturn, its vice
president for sales and marketing, Joseph Kennedy, resigned on
Wednesday to work for an Internet company in California. Kennedy
had been one of GM's young star executives but was passed over late
last year for the chairmanship of Saturn when the man who built the
car division, Donald Hudler, announced his retirement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bennett said Thursday that he would not challenge the election
results and planned to resign as of March 29, even though his term
runs to the end of May. ``I'm going to remake my life and find
another career,'' possibly as an author and consultant on labor
relations, he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Trudell, who replaced Hudler as Saturn's chairman and
president last month, said she was surprised by the vote's outcome
and would miss the current union leaders. But she insisted that
Saturn could continue to grow with the new leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very committed to working with the new group,'' she said
in a telephone interview. ``They share the values of Saturn. They
want to see the plant and the relationship grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Union dissidents were delighted with the vote. ``It's the
greatest day of my life,'' said Thomas Hopp, one of the organizers
of the factory floor-level campaign to unseat Bennett. The men and
women who won the election were working in the factory Thursday and
could not be reached for comment; Hopp, who installs side windows
on the assembly line, had the day off Thursday, partly because his
work schedule this year includes 32 Saturdays without overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was an ally of Bennett in Saturn's early days. But the
two men developed differences and Williams lost his position as an
appointed, full-time union leader in the early 1990s and returned
to work on the assembly line, Hopp said. Williams then ran
successfully for an elected position as one of the local union's
four vice presidents before taking on Bennett and winning the top
job this week as the local union's ``manufacturing adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He kind of rose like the phoenix and defeated his old
adversary,'' Hopp said.

   FILM-CIGARETTES (Undated) _ ``200 Cigarettes'' is, oddly enough,
fresh air in a stale genre. It features a top-notch cast of young

</P>
<P>
   FILM-8MM (Undated) _ Joel Schumacher's new mystery-thriller,
``Eight Millimeter,'' could well have the distinction of being the
most thoroughly sordid and depressing Hollywood big-studio film of
the '90s. It gives a whole new meaning to the word ``downer.'' It's
numbingly vacuous at its core, and _ despite its sanctimonious tone
and ``serious'' subject matter _ it's basically an exploitation
film that's out to shock, titillate and appeal to the absolute
worst in its audience.
</P>
<P>
   By William Arnold. (Story has moved in the ``e'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-SISTER (Undated) _ ``The Other Sister'' is no masterpiece
and definitely has its share of wincing moments, but it's an
incorrigibly sweet-spirited affair that gradually finds a pleasing
middle ground between an affliction-of-the-week weepie and a
rollicking domestic comedy.

   TV-ALICE (Undated) _ There's precious little of Lewis Carroll's
nonsense language in NBC's latest version of ``Alice in
Wonderland,'' and several familiar characters are also missing.
Nonetheless, it is a lavish, loving tribute, and if it sends many
kids and their parents in search of the unabridged version, the

WHEN ARTISTS DRESS UP MODERN JEWISH HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Exhibition notes at end of review.) 
 (af)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Various portraits at the entrance and at the end of
``To the Rescue: Eight Artists in an Archive'' at the International
Center of Photography Midtown, do not make a distinct impression.
This is the nature of most photographs of anonymous people.
</P>
<P>
   These come from the archives of the American Jewish Joint
Distribution Committee, a humanitarian organization, and they show
faces, like any others, which you may glance at, the way you glance
at the faces in a passing crowd on the street, unconsciously.
</P>
<P>
   Photography mirrors our general experience of the world in this
respect: that most of what we see does not register. It appears to
us inarticulate and inert. We often need additional information
about a photograph or we may fail to see it: the image eludes us.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt this was one hurdle that faced the organizers of ``To
the Rescue.'' Their goal: to use historic pictures that record
significant events but are not necessarily very articulate images.
The results, unfortunately, are not good, but the exhibition is an
interesting failure because it raises some general questions about
art and social responsibility and about the tricky distinction that
artists sometimes face between exploitation and information.
</P>
<P>
   The show was put together by Marvin Heiferman and Carole
Kismaric to advertise the committee's efforts. Since 1914, it
helped starving Jews in Palestine, tried to rescue victims from the
Holocaust, cared for survivors, helped rebuild Western Europe after
World War II and sent packages to refuseniks in the Soviet Union.
Today it works in Ethiopia, Bosnia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years it has accumulated 50,000 documentary
photographs. Heiferman and Ms. Kismaric were asked to comb this
archive and put together an exhibition. They went through all the
pictures, one by one.
</P>
<P>
   A photographic archive of a relief organization is, of course,
not the photography department of an art museum. The curators
decided to include eight artists in the project. Did they fear that
history on its own is too boring?
</P>
<P>
   The artists were invited to present works that either
incorporated pictures from the archives or that somehow related to
the photographs, a request vague enough to allow the artists to do
almost anything _ and some did.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Golub, for example, was interested in Jewish resistance
during World War II, so he borrowed photographs from the United
States Holocaust Memorial Museum because the committee's archive
evidently didn't have the photographs he wanted. His installation
consists of several blown-up transparencies, a kind of walk-through
version of one of his paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Magdalena Abakanowicz and Terry Winters simply chose to show
their usual work. Ms. Abakanowicz presents more of her headless,
burlap figures, which have a vague, morbid gravity. Here one
wonders what they are meant to imply, because they could imply many
things, including that Jews are a faceless horde.
</P>
<P>
   Winters presents several heavily worked, handsome abstractions
of multilayered, irregular grids and other patterns, like diagrams.
In an accompanying statement he describes ``not wanting to use the
very real-world subject matter of the archives to add moral or
social weight to my images.''
</P>
<P>
   The works are extensions of what he had already been doing, he
says, now opened up to a particular interpretive slant. ``I'd been
touched,'' he continues, ``by seeing so much forced emigration,
people displaced by circumstances. This seemed to be an overriding
condition described in the archives.'' We are therefore invited to
construe these abstractions in terms of maps and movement.
</P>
<P>
   A question begins to arise: what real function do the archive
and the committee play in these works? Fred Wilson, another artist,
has gone so far as to cover up the photographs he borrows from the
archives, leaving visible only small, frustratingly
incomprehensible portions of them to make a general point that
photographs without explanatory texts accompanying them can be
deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   An image of concentration camp survivors, for instance, is
obscured by Wilson, except for a fragment of the stripes on one
survivor's uniform.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I've obscured the content of most of each photograph except
for the one point that interests me,'' he explains. ``We're always
bombarded with images of some kind. We choose them arbitrarily and
we assign meanings to them and live through them, and then
eventually we decide that they are reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Ewald has taken a different tack. She has selected from
the archives several photographs of children, survivors of World
War II, and distributed the pictures to elementary school students
in Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   By themselves, she says, these photographic portraits don't
reveal much. They depend on a history unfamiliar to the students,
so her goal, in part, was to teach about the war.
</P>
<P>
   The students were asked to write what they imagined it might be
like to be a displaced child, to witness the Holocaust and finally
what they might feel as children of Nazi sympathizers. They then
memorized and performed parts of what they had written.
</P>
<P>
   On a split screen we see an archive portrait and a videotape of
a student pretending to be the child in the picture. ``I wanted to
create a tension between the imagined and historical reality,'' Ms.
Ewald explains.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders if this is a proper way to remember these people. Is
Wilson's manipulation of the concentration camp photograph, to
prove a point about art, how the survivors in it might want their
images to be used?
</P>
<P>
   What, in general, is the responsibility of an artist to the
material he or she uses? Maybe none. There was certainly no
obligation on the part of the artists in this exhibition to make
art that serves the archives or the people in the photographs,
merely to make art.
</P>
<P>
   But neither, then, are we obliged to accept the art on the
artist's terms. We are perfectly free to conclude that the work
comes between us and the more compelling subject that was its
source.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with archival material of this sort is a tricky
business. One of the installations at the Holocaust Museum in
Washington is an arrangement of 1,000 photographs of unidentified
people from a shtetl who were killed by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs are hung in a two-story atrium shaped like a
smokestack. It's an artful design, along the lines of the works in
``To the Rescue.''
</P>
<P>
   That installation can be interpreted in contradictory ways. On
the one hand, it presents pictures of the people of this town as
they lived, so it may be seen as a tribute to their lives. But
because they are an anonymous mass the people also appear to us, in
a sense, as they were to their oppressors.
</P>
<P>
   How would it feel if it were one's own father or daughter or
grandmother whose picture was a decorative effect hung 20 feet
above the heads of people passing through the installation?
</P>
<P>
   Art is an unstable container for history. Its virtue is that it
refuses to conform or to take a back seat to anything or anyone
else. After seeing ``To the Rescue,'' it's possible that you will
recall few of the photographs from the archive, which should not be
surprising. To use art as a package in which to wrap a message is
to invite bad art or bad propaganda and sometimes to end up with
both.
</P>
<P>
   EXHIBITION NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   ``To the Rescue: Eight Artists in an Archive'' remains at the
International Center of Photography Midtown, through May 16. It
will go to the Miami Art Museum (Sept. 15 to Nov. 28) and the
Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston (Oct. 17 to Dec. 3, 2000).

<P>
   TAX-POLICY (Washington) _ While the political fight this year
and probably into the 2000 elections will center on _ tax cuts
versus saving Social Security _ there is also a growing focus on
another, older and more fundamental issue. Should tax policy focus
simply on raising the revenue needed to pay for the activities of
government? Or can the tax code be used as an effective instrument
to address the nation's social and economic ills? By Richard W.
Stevenson.

   TAX-SPOUSE (Undated) _ Until recently, proving that an
individual was truly innocent _ that he or she had no knowledge of
the violations of the tax laws and did not benefit from the money

COMPAQ EXPECTS FEWER DIGITAL LAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. says higher-than-expected attrition of
former Digital Equipment Corp. employees will result in fewer
layoffs this year than previously anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   In Compaq's annual report to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Houston company said Thursday 14,700 Digital jobs
will have been terminated from between July 1, 1998, and June 30,
1999. However, only 12,400 will be ``involuntary separations.''
That's because 2,300 Digital workers have left the company and
found other jobs since Compaq acquired it last year.
</P>
<P>
   A Compaq spokesman said the higher-than-expected attrition will
result in fewer Digital layoffs between now and June. Compaq
currently employs about 7,000 people in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The higher attrition reflects the good times in the Greater
Boston area _ particularly for getting jobs at companies like Sun
Microsystems in Chelmsford and at other companies,'' said Terry
Shannon, editor and publisher of ``Shannon Knows Compaq,'' a
newsletter that tracks the nation's second-largest computer maker.
``Compaq in Massachusetts today is not your father's Digital _ it's
a different environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's goal, announced last June, was to reduce its worldwide
head count by 17,000 between July 1, 1998 and June 30, 1999 to
67,000 employees. Of those cuts, 14,700 jobs were targeted from
Digital and 2,300 from Compaq. When Compaq completed its
acquisition of Digital last year, the combined companies had 84,000
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Compaq said many of the remaining layoffs at
the combined company will come from Europe, where the cost of
terminating people is significantly higher and takes longer to
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 12,800, or 75 percent of the 17,000 employees Compaq is
shedding left the combined company by the end of last year, a
Compaq spokesman said. That included 10,542 employees who were
terminated by the company and received a severance package as part
of the corporate restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   In Compaq's annual SEC report, the company said it set aside
nearly $1.5 billion last year to cover the Digital layoffs and
about $286 million for the Compaq terminations. Last summer, Compaq
underwent a significant restructuring that included closing plants
in Texas and consolidating operations.
</P>
<P>
   A Compaq spokesman noted that despite the hefty Digital layoffs,
it was hiring people in Massachussetts, most notably at the Compaq
services organization in Stow. However, he declined to discuss how
many people were added last year.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Compaq told the SEC it expects to complete the
purchase of Shopping.com, an on-line retailer based in Corona Del
Mar, Calif., for $220 million next month and finalize its $300
million acquistion of Zip2 Corp., an electronic commerce provider
based in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq shares closed at 41, down 1 7/16.

   STUDENCANE, Yugoslavia _ A half-mile stretch of open road was
all that separated Serbian police forces patrolling a checkpoint
and Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas staked out in the village of
Studencane.
</P>
<P>
   The road between was empty but for two farm tillers that the
guerrillas had placed as improvised road blocks. They were the only
indication of the tense standoff that has been dragging on all week
and preventing villagers from coming home.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry police were insisting they would resume
patrols along the road to two Serbian villages beyond. The rebels,
led by Commander Drini, one of the six zone commanders in Kosovo
and who is known only by his nom de guerre, had said they would
fire on any police vehicle that came through.
</P>
<P>
   Commander Drini described it as a ``game of nerves.''
</P>
<P>
   With tensions raised in Kosovo since peace talks in France
failed to reach a final agreement, and with increased Serbian troop
movements around the region, the brinkmanship was potentially
lethal. It had the foreign monitors in the region, led by Brig.
Gen. Michel Maisonneuve of Canada, working all night to avoid a
clash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling pretty bad last night,'' Maisonneuve admitted.
By morning, though, he had persuaded the police to wait another
day, and the rebels to let the patrols resume on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   To try to return to normal, the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which oversees the monitor program, would
accompany the police on Friday, he said, and the guerrillas would
stay hidden from the road while the patrol passed.
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture of compromise, the rebels brought out tractors to
drag away their improvised defenses from the road.
</P>
<P>
   Commander Drini, 38, a former officer of the Yugoslav People's
Army, surrounded by some 20 guerrillas, said, ``It is a chess game,
and we have to sacrifice something.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt vulnerable, he said his anti-tank grenade
launchers were nearby. With a glance toward the Serbian forces
facing him, he said, ``I do not think they are so brave.''
</P>
<P>
   The day was nevertheless a success for the international
monitors who had defused the tension for another day. ``We are
getting across to both sides that it is in their interests to
reduce tensions during this period and bring the villagers back,''
Maisonneuve said. Yet he warned that the situation could change
quickly. ``It just takes one negligent discharge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Military observers are concerned about the increased movement of
large numbers of Serbian troops and armor in Kosovo. Much of it
appears to be exercises as the Serbian military practices
evacuating bases and barracks in the event of NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   There also has been a buildup of troops along the southern
border with Macedonia and the army is reported to have mined a
bridge near the frontier. The heavy troop presence could easily
block the departure from Kosovo of foreign monitors, one observer
said.
</P>
<P>
   It also could block the arrival of a NATO peacekeeping force for
Kosovo, which probably would arrive from Macedonia, where the NATO
extraction force is already based.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest fear is, however, that the Serbian military is
planning an offensive against the rebels and the ethnic Albanian
villages under their control. The Serbian army announced it was
conducting a ``live-firing exercise'' around the village of Bukos
in northern Kosovo Thursday, but a reporter who gained access said
the army was firing mortars on the village.
</P>
<P>
   The brinkmanship in Studencane was an illustration of how both
sides are trying to inch forward to increase the area they control,
while a peace settlement remains uncertain.

MAGICAL `ALICE' A BENCHMARK OF TV FANTASY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Alice in Wonderland,'' one of the sturdiest of all perennials,
springs up brimming with new life at 8 p.m. Sunday night on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour production is such a sparkler that it's a shame
NBC didn't schedule it an hour earlier for children.
</P>
<P>
   This version follows the familiar pattern set by the 1933 film
of Lewis Carroll's wild masterpiece. Which is, to stud the cast
with marvelous character actors and let their cameo performances
carry the day.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1933, it was the likes of W.C. Fields and Jack Oakie. On
Sunday, NBC showcases Whoopi Goldberg (Cheshire Cat), Ben Kingsley
(Major Caterpillar), Miranda Richardson (Queen of Hearts), Martin
Short (Mad Hatter), Peter Ustinov (Walrus), Christopher Lloyd
(White Knight), Gene Wilder (Mock Turtle), Pete Postlethwaite
(Carpenter) and Robbie Coltrane and George Wendt (Tweedledum and
Tweedledee).
</P>
<P>
   They're directed by Nick Willing (``Photographing Faeries''),
surrounded by dozens of creations from Jim Henson's Creature Shop
and abetted by zippy special effects from the FrameStore in London.
</P>
<P>
   And Alice? She's Tina Majorino, a child actress who's been in
the failed TV series ``Camp Wilder'' and several films, including
``Corrina, Corrina,'' ``When a Man Loves a Woman'' and
``Waterworld.''
</P>
<P>
   Majorino comes across at first as an unattractive and
disappointingly dour Alice. But she's a decent actress, and she
gains ground through the course of the show. When she does venture
a smile, it's an event.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cameo stars, the standouts are the shrieking
Richardson (``Chop off more heads _ it's wonderful''), the gentle
Wilder in his turtle get-up and the comically uninhibited Short.
</P>
<P>
   Short might, in fact, be the definitive Hatter. By some
photographic magic, his shoulders have been pinched and his body
narrowed, and his head ballooned into funhouse proportions. He
sings, he dances, he cringes and he vamps, all to delightful
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Short's Mad Hatter is part of the amazing midsection of ``Alice
in Wonderland,'' taking Alice in stunning sequence from the Mad
Hatter's tea party, to the helter-skelter croquet match with the
Queen of Hearts, to a sweet song and dance with Mock Turtle, to
Lloyd's claptrap Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alice'' isn't quite that good from start to finish. But when
it is, you might find yourself thinking that television has come up
with its own inventive classic in the vein of ``The Wizard of Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC's annual special-effects extravaganzas _ ``Gulliver's
Travels,'' ``Ulysses,'' ``Merlin'' _ reach a peak with ``Alice in
Wonderland.'' Characters tumble in and out of books, sets inflate
and deflate to match Alice's growths and shrinkages, humans
interact with Creature Shop creations, and actors morph into
strange beings. The set design and costuming are sumptuous.
</P>
<P>
   The fun is in the journey; what ``Alice'' means as an integrated
story is anyone's guess, except that Alice is dreaming in the real
world to avoid having to sing for guests at her parents' garden
party.
</P>
<P>
   But if you choose to look at it this way, you're obviously
welcome to sink your imagination into the tale's more, uh,
psychedelic aspects.
</P>
<P>
   Alice expands and shrinks as she partakes of mysterious potions
and magic mushrooms, all in her quest to reach a verdant garden.
</P>
<P>
   So why, then, isn't the White Knight talking backward? Go ask
Alice. I think she'll know.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While NBC experiences a high of sorts, HBO stubs its toe
Saturday night with ``Lansky,'' a cable movie starring Richard
Dreyfuss as Meyer Lansky, the Jewish immigrant turned Mafia
kingpin.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has a pedigree. It's directed by John McNaughton
(``Wild Things''). The script is from David Mamet (``Wag the Dog,''
``The Spanish Prisoner''), no less. And Dreyfuss is joined by Eric
Roberts, Anthony LaPaglia, Beverly D'Angelo and Illeana Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie jumps around in Lansky's life without traction and
sometimes without logic. In the midst of the highly impressionistic
technique, the viewer is unlikely to feel an attachment to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a shrewd and powerful performance, Dreyfuss can't buck
the obstacles. If you do watch, though, just for the heck of it,
pay special attention to a brief World War II scene aboard a
military plane.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why, nor can I swear it's deliberate, but in that
scene Dreyfuss lapses into a dead-on impression of Robert Duvall.
Not only that, but it's seemingly the Duvall character from ``A
Civil Action.''

ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT BACTERIA FOUND IN CHICKEN FEED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (mk) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bacteria that are resistant to the most powerful antibiotics
used to treat infections in people have been found in chicken feed,
researchers are reporting, a finding that is likely to fuel
concerns about the threat to public health from widespread use of
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers studied only a small amount of feed. Still, they
said, finding such organisms on the threshold of the human food
supply was an ominous sign. They said their discovery might be the
first report of such contamination in the United States. The
scientists, from the University of Maryland, are reporting their
findings Friday in the British medical journal The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
   Although animal feed is not expected to be germ free and the
bacteria were not harmful to healthy people, the organisms' ability
to withstand potent antibiotics may pose a threat to public health,
the scientists said. If people who eat or handle contaminated
chicken become infected, the harmless bacteria may pass their genes
for drug-resistance to other, dangerous organisms. Or, in patients
with lowered immunity from AIDS or treatments for cancer or organ
transplants, the once-harmless microbes may turn dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Illnesses caused by drug-resistant bacteria can be fatal, or
require treatment with several drugs. Such infections are
increasing in the United States and Europe. Many scientists blame
the growing strength of microbes on the overuse of antibiotics, in
people and in agriculture. Nearly half the 50 million pounds of
antibiotics produced in the United States are used in animals,
mostly as feed additives to promote growth.
</P>
<P>
   In any population of bacteria, some may naturally be more
resistant to antibiotics, and when infections are treated with the
drugs, the resistant microbes may survive and multiply. Each time
antibiotics are given, they may be less effective because more
bacteria are resistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studies show that rather than a single bad strain in a
hospital, there are hundreds, if not thousands,'' said Dr. J. Glenn
Morris Jr., head of hospital epidemiology at the University of
Maryland in Baltimore, and an author of the Lancet study, which was
published as ``a research letter,'' a report less comprehensive
than an article. ``The more we look, the more we find these
multiresistant organisms everywhere. Where are they coming from?''
</P>
<P>
   Morris said he and his colleagues, who had seen patients die
from drug-resistant infections, thought the organisms might be
coming from different sources, and wondered if one might be food.
They knew that in Europe, use of a powerful antibiotic in animal
feed had been linked to resistant infections in both livestock and
in people who ate meat from infected animals.
</P>
<P>
   To find out whether some infections could come from what the
animals ate, the researchers tested commercial chicken feed they
had bought in a closed sack and opened under sterile conditions.
They did not expect to find anything, Morris said, so they were
shocked to find bacteria known as enterococci, normal inhabitants
of the intestine in people and animals, that were resistant to
multiple antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Most disturbing, Morris said, the organisms were resistant to
vancomycin, a powerful drug that was long considered the last line
of defense against dangerous infections. But deadly infections
resistant to the drug began showing up in people in the United
States in the past few years. The organisms have never been
detected in chickens in the United States, Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``If it's in feed it may subsequently show up in
chickens and serve as another mode of introduction into human
populations.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris would not name the manufacturer of the feed and said he
had no explanation for how it might have become contaminated, or
how the enterococci became resistant to antibiotics. He said the
feed did not contain antibiotic additives.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest chicken producers use no bagged feed, said
a spokesman for one, Tyson Foods, who said they make their feed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Sundlof, director of the Center for Veterinary
Medicine at the Food and Drug Administration, said he was puzzled
by the report, because feed pellets were normally produced under
such high temperatures and pressure that bacteria would die. But,
he said, ``If the feed is contaminated, and from consuming that
feed, our livestock become reservoirs for vancomycin resistant
enterococci, then potentially we could have a problem.''

CHECK FUND CUSTODIAN ACCUSED IN ALLEGED THEFT FIRED

<P>
   BOSTON _ Veteran Treasury employee John Trischitta, arrested
last Friday for his role in the alleged theft of $6.5 million from
the state's Unpaid Check Fund, has been fired.
</P>
<P>
   New Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien Thursday sent a short, direct,
dismissal letter to the 20-year department employee after he spent
nearly a week on paid leave while the investigation ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Trischitta, who rose from a teller at the now-defunct State
House bank to become the gatekeeper of the enormous Unpaid Check
Fund, is out on $10,000 bail after pleading not guilty in Boston
Municipal Court on Friday to charges of bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly alleges Trischitta accepted a
$50,000 bribe from Martin Robbins, an ``heir finder'' who would
comb the Unpaid Check Fund for large sums that he could return to
their owner for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   But Robbins was also arrested last week, charged with larceny,
forgery and uttering, after a BankBoston employee tipped off the
AG's office that he was trying to withdraw $6.5 million from an
escrow account there.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, who is being held at the Nashua Street Jail, allegedly
forged documents that enabled him to siphon the money out of the
Unpaid Check Fund into the escrow account.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly asserts that the suspect paid Trischitta a cut of the
stolen money in exchange for directing him to the uncashed checks.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the two suspects declined to comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And as of Friay, Trischitta's boss, Robert E. Foley, the deputy
treasurer in charge of cash management, will also be out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said she had planned to replace him with her own
political appointment before news of the investigation broke.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Reilly and O'Brien declined to comment Thursday.

 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In three separate accidents last summer, 11 small
children climbed into car trunks, pulled them shut and died from
the heat when they could not get out.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in March, after a complicated design effort, General
Motors is offering an illuminated release handle that many children
could use to escape. The handles, which dealers will install as
options inside trunks, stay lighted for half an hour after the
trunk is closed.
</P>
<P>
   The device can be installed in most family passenger vehicles
made since 1990, GM said, though it cannot fit in some specialized
vehicles, like Corvettes. For cars that have rear seats that fold
down to give trunk access, the kit includes a catch to make it hard
for a child to fold down the seat. The whole package costs $50.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, car trunks are not by any means the biggest
danger for small children, but they came under scrutiny in August
when five girls, aged 2 through 6, crawled into the trunk of a
Saturn in West Valley City, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   When the mother of two of the girls realized they were missing,
she drove around the neighborhood looking for them _ not realizing
they were in the trunk. One of the police officers who were called
in to search opened the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Two more children died in Greensboro, Pa., and four in Gallup,
N.M.
</P>
<P>
   GM set its engineers to work on the problem, but they
immediately called for outside help. ``We have no in-house
expertise with human factors for 3-year-olds,'' said William Kemp,
a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The company went to Fisher-Price, the toy maker, for advice, and
ended up at Exponent/Failure Analysis Associates of San Francisco,
where Christine Wood, a child psychologist, helped run more than
200 tests of nine designs.
</P>
<P>
   One early choice was a knob, but the smallest children lacked
the finger strength to twist it. Another was a lighted pull cord.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured it would really be so obvious,'' Dr. Wood told a
news conference in Washington. ``We adults were sure it would work,
but we found that very young children believe they shouldn't touch
things that looked electrical, and they wouldn't even try it.''
</P>
<P>
   The engineers tried a lighted switch that looked like a wall
switch for a light.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't work,'' Kemp said. ``A light switch doesn't
telegraph being an opener. We interviewed the children and they
said things like, `I wanted to get out, not turn the light on.'''
</P>
<P>
   The lighted handle, he said, ``looks somewhat like a door
handle; it screams out `handleness.''' But it did not work with all
children; some, especially the youngest, lay passively in the
trunks and did not try the handle. Researchers believe their tests
may not duplicate the real world: some children will panic and will
not find the release.
</P>
<P>
   The kits are available as a dealer-installed option on new cars.
GM is not installing them as standard equipment because it is
waiting for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to
write a standard, Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
   First, Buckle the Adults
</P>
<P>
   Auto accidents are the leading cause of death for young
children, killing about 2,000 people age 14 and under each year.
Fewer would die if more were in seat belts or car seats; over half
the children killed are not in seat belts or other restraints.
</P>
<P>
   But how can states raise the proportion of parents who buckle up
children? Advocates for child safety are trying a new approach:
focusing on the laws that cover adults.
</P>
<P>
   While all 50 states have laws regarding car seat restraints, the
laws on children are strong but those covering adults are much
weaker. In all states, police officers who observe an unbelted
child can pull over a car and write a ticket; in 35 states, police
cannot write tickets for non-use by adults unless they first pull
over a car for some other offense.
</P>
<P>
   The determining factor in whether children wear belts is not
whether the state has a law, according to researchers, but whether
the driver is buckled. According to the Air Bag and Seat Belt
Safety Campaign, an organization financed by insurers, auto
companies and the federal government, in cars in which the driver
is buckled, 87 percent of the children are appropriately
restrained; if the driver is unbuckled, only 24 percent of the
children are buckled in. In other words, drivers who don't buckle
themselves don't bother with the children either.
</P>
<P>
   So organizers are bringing school-aged children into state
capitols in several states to buttonhole legislators for stronger
laws on adults. This month, they hit Idaho, Michigan, Minnesota,
Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is also advertising. In Florida, it is going beyond
public service ads and spending $500,000 on print and TV spots. The
TV ads show emergency workers at crash scenes wheeling away dead or
injured children. ``Most grown-ups who don't wear seat belts don't
buckle kids,'' says an actor in one who appears to be 9 or 10 years
old. The Florida ads are in English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, where the legislative session starts on March 2, has
been a target of the campaign. It is among the states that require
that the police first stop vehicles for some other offense before
they can ticket adults for not using belts. Last year, the Florida
House of Representatives passed a bill to provide ``standard''
enforcement, but it died in the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never sponsored a bill where I had so many groups and
resolutions supporting it and not been able to pass it,'' said
Dennis Jones, a former chairman of the House Transportation
Committee and now Speaker of the House. Some voters, especially in
rural areas, strongly oppose seat belt laws for adults.
</P>
<P>
   But children, Jones said, will be effective lobbyists, and
persuading more adults to buckle up will also help insure
compliance among children who are old enough to buckle themselves.
``Kids have the tendency to do what they see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Right Seat, Wrong Car?
</P>
<P>
   Sell a baby seat to parents and most will install it
incorrectly, government studies have found. Give the parents
written or verbal instructions, and most will still install it
wrong, says the National Transportation Safety Board, which wants
to try a new approach. The states should establish permanent
clinics where drivers could go with car and car seat to have the
two linked up correctly, the board decided in January.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that dozens of different seat belt designs are in
use in cars as well as dozens of different child seat designs. They
all work together differently.
</P>
<P>
   A properly used child restraint cuts the risk of death or
serious injury 71 percent; an improperly used one cuts the risk
only 59 percent, according to a study by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration. That suggests that dozens of
children die each year because their seats were attached to cars
incorrectly or because they were not properly in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term solution is a standardized car and baby-seat
design, which President Clinton may announce Friday. But cars
already on the road will be carrying children for years to come;
hence the recommendation for clinics.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA Chairman James Hall said in an interview that auto
dealers, volunteer fire companies and others had held one-time
clinics at which parents could have their car seats checked, but
that ``any event you go to, you're finding misuse or
misinstallation of 80 percent plus.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, is ``there are literally hundreds of
thousands of different possibilities out there, given all the car
seats and the different back seats in passenger and sport utility
vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, Hall went to Australia and visited its network of
permanent fitting stations. Ninety percent of seats there were used
correctly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Safety board officials say Kiwanis International, the American
Automobile Association, Ford Motor, DaimlerChrysler, GM and the
National Safe Kids Campaign, a safety group, have all expressed
interest in helping bring permanent car seat clinics to the United
States. &QL;

 &HT;    Isakson sworn in, marking departure from Gingrich era
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Where his predecessor loved to talk, Johnny Isakson
kicked off his congressional service Thursday with a pledge to
listen.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Republican brought 150 family members and friends
with him from Atlanta on a campaign-chartered Delta jet to watch
him take the oath of office and receive a warm welcome from
Democrats and Republicans alike.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling some advice from his first days in the state
legislature, Isakson said, ``The best way to learn is to keep your
mouth shut. I intend to be a very good listener.''
</P>
<P>
   His first speech in the House of Representatives, delivered
inadvertently from the lectern on the Democratic side of the
chamber, and his comments throughout the day were filled with
modesty and self-deprecation _ Isakson trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   In tone and substance, his words marked a departure from the
20-year tenure of Newt Gingrich, the former speaker whose seat
Isakson took Thursday. Gingrich was not at the Capitol, but he was
not far from anyone's mind, including Isakson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am well aware that to all of you I am nothing more today
than the fellow that replaced Newt. I hope in the years to come
I'll be a respected friend and one who joined with you to make a
difference for the United States of America,'' Isakson said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), the dean of the state's delegation and
frequent critic of Gingrich, welcomed Isakson to the House and
praised him as a bridge builder. The 54-year-old real estate
executive took the oath from Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), whose
lower profile also stands in sharp contrast to Gingrich's
never-a-dull-moment style of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Isakson nor Hastert would have played the roles they did
on Thursday had Gingrich not decided in November to give up his
role as speaker and his seat in Congress following the GOP's
disappointing performance in the 1998 election.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, in all likelihood, would Thursday have been Rep. Robert
Livingston's (R-La.) last work day in the House.
</P>
<P>
   A half hour before he was sworn in, Isakson had a chance hallway
encounter with Livingston, the speaker-to-be who decided to resign
from Congress on the heels of revelations of marital infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're coming in as I'm going out. I hope you have a long and
wonderful career,'' Livingston told Isakson.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in his farewell speech in the House, Livingston said,
``Compromise is the glue that renders democracy possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are words that Isakson lives by, as he noted when he
arrived at the Capitol in a taxi cab shortly after 9 a.m. ``That
line about compromise still works pretty good,'' he said. ``I've
been married to the same woman for 31 years. I know all about
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   In his convincing win in Tuesday's special election, Isakson
made a virtue of criticism from some Republicans that he is
insufficiently committed to conservative principle.
</P>
<P>
   The victory spurred calls from Hastert and Majority Whip Tom
DeLay (R-Texas), as well as constituents and corporate interests
who wanted to know how he would vote on a variety of subjects.
</P>
<P>
   After just a few hours of sleep, Isakson awoke at 4:30 a.m.
Thursday, gathered his family and headed to Hartsfield
International Airport. He helped flight attendants serve breakfast
on the flight to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He and his backers were in high spirits when they filed off a
Boeing 727 at Ronald Reagan National Airport. And why not? Isakson
scored his first big political win after two failed statewide
campaigns, including a 1996 battle for the Republican nomination
for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Dianne, three children, Kevin, John and Julie, and
mother-in-law Gay Davison joined Isakson on Thursday. So too did
Georgia School Superintendent Linda Schrenko, Marietta Daily
Journal publisher Otis Brumby and prominent Georgia Republicans
Oscar Persons and Jeanne Ferst.
</P>
<P>
   The new House member admittedly did not know his way around the
Capitol, and passed one new colleague after another without either
party knowing who the other was.
</P>
<P>
   But after being shown his new office in Rayburn House Office
Building _ Gingrich's former district office in a desirable suite
with a view of the Capitol dome _ Isakson acquired a voting card
and a lapel pin that identified him as a member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone rang in his office as soon as an aide de-activated
the answering machine. The caller was former Sen. Bob Dole, whose
1996 presidential campaign Isakson supported. Isakson said they
plan to have coffee once he settles in.
</P>
<P>
   He fulfilled his first request from a constituent when he
procured a copy of the House rules for a woman who is working on a
project for a college course.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson cast his first vote for a noncontroversial
telecommunications bill that passed 403-3. His emotions normally
held in check in public, Isakson allowed that walking onto the
House floor for the first time was an ``awesome moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid jokes about not knowing where to go and what to do, Isakson
exuded a confidence that he said comes from 17 years in the
Democratic-controlled Georgia Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the lingo and I know some of the rules,'' Isakson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Isakson put it succinctly: ``He is very effective and he
loves it.''
</P>
<P>
   He got his first taste Thursday of being in the majority,
remembering that in his first year as minority leader in the
Georgia House of Representatives, Democrats outnumbered Republicans
161 to 19. Republicans have a six-seat margin in the House now that
Isakson is among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more vote!'' Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-La.) quipped to House
Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas after Isakson took his seat.
</P>
<P>
   At day's end, after a tour of the Franklin Roosevelt memorial,
Isakson and his entourage boarded their flight back to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   He will return in time for the next session of the House on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But before then, Isakson said he must complete paperwork to
resign as state school board chairman and sever his daily ties to
Northside Realty, his family real estate business.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson and his wife are not planning to move to Washington, but
Isakson said he does not expect to have trouble finding an
apartment for the three- or four-day House work week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Housing, that's something I know,'' he said.

IRAN TO HOLD FIRST LOCAL ELECTIONS SINCE 1979 REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Local elections on Friday in Iran are shaping up
as an important test of strength between moderates and the
conservatives who remain the dominant political force.
</P>
<P>
   The elections will be the first local contests since the Islamic
revolution of 1979 ushered in an era in which conservative clerics
have been in charge. More than 300,000 candidates are seeking
posts, including women, secularists and others wholly unconnected
to the mullahs who hold most central authority.
</P>
<P>
   A screening panel aligned with the conservatives has
disqualified a number of well-known moderates, a tactic used in
past elections to limit choices. But in a reflection of internal
rivalries, the Interior Ministry has rejected those
disqualifications, leaving open the question of who might be
permitted to hold office.
</P>
<P>
   The outcomes could provide an important gauge of the ability of
President Mohammed Khatami, whose election in 1997 opened a fissure
in the conservatives' grip on power, to maneuver around obstacles
planted by his rivals. The most telling indicator is most likely to
be the fate of one of his closest advisers, Abdollah Nouri. The
conservative-dominated Parliament ousted Nouri as interior minister
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri is seeking election to a local council, and his candidacy
has been the source of the sharpest contention between the
supervisory council, which is aligned with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
the hard-line conservative who is the supreme leader of Iran, and
the Interior Ministry, which reports to Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the supervisory council rejected the candidacy of
Nouri and 50 other prominent moderates because their loyalty to
Ayatollah Khamenei had been questioned or because they were seen as
having ``suspect records from the past,'' according to the official
Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry overruled that finding, meaning that the
candidates' names will probably appear on the ballots. But in a
sign of the seriousness of the struggle, the supervisory council
has threatened to nullify the election results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president, his deputy or his interior minister _ none of
them can have a say in the decision of the council,'' said the head
of the panel, Ali Movahedi Savoji.
</P>
<P>
   In telephone interviews from Tehran, Iran, Western diplomats and
Iranian political analysts said the lines had been sharply drawn.
``Both sides are digging in their heels,'' one diplomat based in
Tehran said.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear sign of the tensions, a gunman opened fire on
Wednesday on the election headquarters of a moderate party in
Tehran. No one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, authority across Iran, with its population of more
than 60 million, has remained within the closely circumscribed
central hierarchy, which has appointed governors, mayors and
religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But the election of the local councils, with 200,000 seats, has
the potential to begin to shift the balance, putting at least some
power in the hands of vast numbers of ordinary people. Khatami has
promoted the elections as an important step in developing Iranian
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates whom the supervisory boards rejected are a tiny
fraction of the candidates, but the number of nonclerics who seek
office seems to have overwhelmed the screening panels.

 &HT;    Texans' contributions to Clinton defense fund top $86,000
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texans, including big-name Democrats and plain
old citizens who thought their president was getting a raw deal,
poured more than $86,000 into Bill Clinton's legal defense fund in
the last half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think the whole screwy (Kenneth) Starr group is out of
balance for justice,'' said Austinite Wally Ellinger, who three
times responded to fund-raising letters by sending a total of $30.
``When there comes a letter, I just throw in 10 bucks and say good
wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of Texas donors was topped by a $10,000 contribution
from Dallas housewife Hayden McIlroy. At the bottom of the list,
which includes 1,226 donations, were $1 contributions from Abilene
housewife Sadie Smith, Celeste retiree Isabele Magedson, San
Antonio nurse Allen B. Eastman and Midland businessman Raymond
Horton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made mistakes like all of us, but I judge that for the
American people he has done a good job,'' said Horton, who has
never voted for Clinton for president.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the president's legal defense fund collected more than
$4.5 million in 1998. About $2.3 million came in after Clinton
admitted in August that he had had an improper relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The funds will be used to help pay the Clintons' mounting legal
bills, which, thanks to the fund, are now down to $5.2 million.
More than 50,000 Americans made contributions to the fund, formally
known as the Clinton Legal Expense Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, more than half the contributions were for $25 or
less. Only 5 percent were for $200 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more well-known names on the list of Texas donors to
the fund are former U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright of Fort Worth,
$200; state Rep. Al Edwards of Houston, $100; University of Texas
System General Counsel and former state Sen. Ray Farabee, $100; and
former state Rep. John Hirschi of Wichita Falls, $100.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Treasurer Azie Taylor Morton, who served in the
Carter administration and now lives in Austin, is the trustee for
the fund, which used mailing lists from the Democratic National
Committee and other political sources.
</P>
<P>
   Austin retiree Robert Gronlie said he sent $100 because he did
not like how Clinton was being treated. ``I think the guy is being
persecuted,'' he said. Mark Batterson, an Austin publisher, sent
$350 to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the kind of guy, when I was going to school I used to
defend the little guys against bullies,'' said Batterson, adding
that he was not ``thrilled'' by Clinton's behavior. ``But at the
same time I think he has been a good president and apparently most
people agree with me.''

IOC TO DISCUSS MORE EXPULSIONS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The beleaguered International Olympic Committee begins deciding
this weekend whether to expel another dozen or more members in what
is already the worst scandal in modern Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's six-man investigative panel will meet at Olympic
headquarters in Switzerland to weigh more evidence of wrongdoing by
IOC members submitted recently by the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee as well as numerous bid cities for five other Games.
</P>
<P>
   Though four members have already resigned and another five have
been forced out for taking improper payoffs or gifts from the Salt
Lake City bidders for the 2002 Winter Games, another 10 were
implicated earlier this month and more names are expected to
surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many? I don't know,'' said IOC vice president Richard
Pound of Canada, who chairs the panel. ``It's kind of a movable
feast at the moment. The number of cities we've heard from is in
the teens and some are still coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the IOC has vowed to clean house definitively at its
special session on March 17-18 in Lausanne, the inquiry panel plans
to finish its work Sunday and make an immediate report to the
executive board, which will vote to expel, warn, or exonerate those
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to give the members as much notice as we can,''
said Pound. ``Anybody who may be subject to expulsion would want an
opportunity to get ready to defend himself.''
</P>
<P>
   A 300-page report issued this month by the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee's ethics panel unveiled a second wave of members who
allegedly took cash and gifts: Seiuli Paul Wallwork of Western
Samoa, Shagdarjav Magvan of Mongolia, Austin Sealy of Barbados,
Phillip Coles of Australia, Anani Matthia of Togo, Ashwini Kumar of
India, Ram Ruhee of Mauritius, Willi Kaltschmitt of Guatemala, and
Mohamed Zerguini of Algeria. The report also provided fresh details
about executive board member Kim Un-yong of South Korea and Louis
Guirandou-N'Diaye of Ivory Coast, who were already under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The payoffs ranged from a $100,000 job for Kim's son to a
$30,000 loan to Wallwork's wife to $3,000 monthly payments to Sealy
to Super Bowl trips for Coles and Kaltschmitt. The Nagano bidders
also forwarded names of nine IOC members who took multiple vacation
trips to Japan at Nagano's expense; other cities have said they
provided gifts far in excess of the $150 limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's inappropriate? It's like saying I can't define
obscenity, but I know it when I see it,'' Pound said. ``If you get
a gift that's $151, that's clearly not a problem. If you get a
Mercedes, that clearly is.''
</P>
<P>
   Coles, who has vigorously denied wrongdoing, and one or two
other members are expected to appear in person before the panel.
They and others will also have a chance to explain themselves next
month to the executive board and to the full body, which is
expected to expel any guilty members who have not stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   Pound also said that the investigative panel would quickly
exonerate any members it found blameless. ``We don't want this
thing to be hanging over the heads of IOC members who are not
guilty of anything,'' he said.

PENTAGON TOUTS BENEFITS OF MOCK OAKLAND INVASION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Marine and Navy officials on Thursday defended a
planned mock invasion of Oakland, Monterey and Alameda, Calif.,
next month as an opportunity to try out new military equipment and
tactics in an urban setting.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps said in a statement that the war games, which
have provoked strong local opposition, will help the service
prepare ``for urban battlespaces of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Cmdr. Bruce Nichols, of the Navy's Maritime Battle Center in
Newport, R.I., said the mock battles will test ``new concepts and
technology'' needed in future conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the war game will ``directly influence'' future
Navy budgets and military tactics, according to a Navy statement.
</P>
<P>
   Officials planning the exercise spoke at a Pentagon news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The event will involve some 6,000 troops and five Navy ships.
Officials said no more than 700 Marines, from a Marine
Expeditionary Force at Camp Pendelton, Calif., will be brought to
shore at any one time.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Corps Col. Gary Anderson, chief of staff of the Marine
Corp Warfighting Laboratory in Quantico, Va., said that any
disruption in the California cities will be minimal. He also said a
mock battle scheduled in Oakland during daylight hours won't add
significantly to the area's noise pollution. ``We are not going to
be all that loud,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise is scheduled to begin with an amphibious landing
and helicopter assault on Monterey March 13. It will shift to
Alameda and Oakland March 15-18 with some Marines conducting
reconnaissance operations at the Naval Weapons Station at Concord
and at Moffet Field and other Marines staging a pitched ``battle''
at Oakland's shuttered Oak Knoll Medical Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines view the exercise, dubbed Urban Warrior, as an
important step toward shifting away from traditional strategies in
fighting a foe like Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The military also sees the battles of tomorrow taking place in
ethnically divided, war-torn Third World cities, like Mogadishu in
Somalia where 18 U.S. servicemen died in 1993 as part of a United
Nations humanitarian mission.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the war doctrine that currently drives Marine Corps
planning is that troops are supposed to avoid fighting in cities
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   But when they cannot do that, the standard tactic is to shell
the cities with artillery and then send in infantry units with guns
blazing. The result is significant loss of life and property.
</P>
<P>
   ``This approach will not be suitable in the future,'' the
service said, adding that future conflicts in such cities will be
limited in scope.
</P>
<P>
   The exercises in Northern California are meant to help devise a
new urban war doctrine and military tactics to replace the old
ones.
</P>
<P>
   In the March war games, troops will operate under the following
scenario: A nation friendly to the United States requests help in
dealing with a humanitarian crisis. Along the way, U.S. forces
encounter a factionalized population, some of whom oppose the U.S.
presence and may be preparing a biological weapons attack. American
commanders will then have to devise tactics to protect themselves
while defusing the crisis. In the process they will be testing new
weapons and communications equipment, which could also be used in
disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   Local opposition to the war games led the National Park Service
to bar the military from conducting some of them at the Presidio in
San Francisco because of possible damage to environmentally
sensitive dunes.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when the military switched those exercises to Oakland,
Mayor Jerry Brown supported the plan. Peace activists accused him
of shedding his old skepticism of the military and now ``promoting
violence.''

ESPRIT DE CORP. STARTS A REVIVAL CAMPAIGN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An advertising and marketing effort is seeking to rekindle the
sprightly spirit that a decade ago propelled Esprit apparel into
the front ranks _ or is it racks? _ of clothing brands.
</P>
<P>
   The revival campaign by the amusingly named Esprit parent,
Esprit de Corp. in San Francisco, is getting under way with
advertisements in March issues of magazines and posters in New York
and San Francisco. The campaign, with an estimated budget of $5
million to $6 million, is the first by Toth Brand Imaging in New
York and Concord, Mass., since the agency was awarded the Esprit
account in October.
</P>
<P>
   The would-be comeback for the Esprit lines of sportswear,
footwear and accessories, which are sold at retail stores and
through catalogs, is indicative of ambitious plans by marketers to
capitalize on strong consumer demand for name-brand products. That
is particularly true in categories like apparel where shoppers
display intense image-consciousness. The inherent value perceived
in moribund brands is a leading reason for the increase in attempts
to resuscitate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '80s, Esprit was the embodiment of a life-style look,
weekend clothes and San Francisco,'' said Tom Julian, the trend
analyst for Fallon McElligott in New York. ``There was always a
good feeling about Esprit: free spirited, casual, somewhat
individualized, ethereal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The brand still does have some cachet,'' he added. ``But is it
the right time to bring Esprit back now?''
</P>
<P>
   The relatively new top management of Esprit de Corp. thinks the
timing is propitious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to re-establish a relationship with the consumer,''
said Jay Margolis, the chairman and chief executive at Esprit de
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody grew up with Esprit, but it lost touch with us over
a period of time,'' he added. ``We want to bring back Esprit, but a
new Esprit versus the 1970s and 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Margolis, a former top executive at Tommy Hilfiger and Liz
Claiborne, became an owner of Esprit de Corp. in October 1996 when
he, Oaktree Capital Management and Cerberus Partners bought out
Susie Tompkins. She co-founded the company in 1968 with Doug
Tompkins, then her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Under the previous ownership, Esprit became known for campaigns
created in-house that included work by the Italian fashion
photographer Oliviero Toscani and embodied so-called cause-related
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in 1991, Esprit introduced television and print
advertising that gave voice to opinions expressed on thousands of
postcards it received after asking consumers, ``If you could change
the world, what would you do?'' The thoughts ranged from the
idealistic (``I'd reverse the status of celebrities and
educators'') to the controversial (``Keep a woman's right to choose
... unless George Bush is free to baby-sit'').
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea behind'' the new campaign, according to Michael
Toth, president and executive creative director at Toth, is to
evoke ``those wonderful values Esprit always had,'' but ``in a way
that's relevant today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something extraordinary about where Esprit was,'' said
Toth, who has created ads for fashion brands like Coach, Hilfiger
and London Fog, ``but trying to re-create it, you fall short. You
have to refresh and modernize.''
</P>
<P>
   A decision was made, Toth and Margolis said, to concentrate on
women 24 to 28, slightly older than the original Esprit customer,
yet not to exclude those outside the primary audience. Margolis
identified the parameters in a personal way by declaring, ``My
daughter is 19 and my wife is 50.''
</P>
<P>
   Julian said he thought that approach represented an ``emotional
opportunity for the brand,'' making sense because many ``Esprit
teen-agers are now 30-something.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign carries the theme ``I am Esprit,'' typifying a
trend in creative content that was recently labeled ``affirmation
advertising'' by Business Week magazine; Coldwell Banker, Lotus,
Mattel and Molson are among marketers that are running campaigns in
which individual consumers declare ``I am'' confident or empowered
or independent.
</P>
<P>
   The Esprit ads and posters feature striking head-and-shoulders
shots of women by the photographer Christian Witkin. There are
captions in the corners meant to describe the ``sensibility'' of
the subjects, Margolis said, ``in terms of what they're thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   These are among the captions: ``She believes that words haven't
lost their meaning,'' ``She changes without any warning,'' ``She
surprises even herself'' and ``She believes in hopeful romantics.''
Adjacent to the captions are a listing for the Esprit World Wide
Web site and a toll-free Esprit telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are running in magazines like Cosmopolitan, Elle,
Entertainment Weekly, Glamour, Jane, Marie Claire, Martha Stewart
Living and Self. The posters are appearing on bus shelters and
telephone kiosks and as ``wild postings'' pasted up at construction
sites and on vacant storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   Toth also produced a video reel to run on television monitors in
stores, in which women quietly are heard expressing such sentiments
as ``I listen to every voice'' and ``I am natural.'' A 30-second
version is being considered for a television commercial.

A BETTER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A succession of excesses and abuses culminating in Kenneth
Starr's investigation of the Monica Lewinsky scandal have persuaded
many in Congress that the Independent Counsel Act should either be
allowed to lapse when it expires on June 30 or be substantially
revised.
</P>
<P>
   When investigating members of an administration, there is the
same need to prevent a conflict of interest as there was in 1978,
when the law was first adopted. Then as now, public trust in
impartial justice can best be preserved if members of the executive
branch are not investigated by colleagues in the same
administration.
</P>
<P>
   But if a revised Independent Counsel Act is to satisfy the
requirements of impartial justice, the revisions will have to be
thoroughgoing and rooted in basic constitutional principles.
</P>
<P>
   Independent counsels must be made accountable, like every other
official in the American system of government. A good start would
be to impose the same kinds of budgetary limits and time
constraints that all other prosecutors accept as necessary checks
on their power.
</P>
<P>
   An independent counsel should also have limited jurisdiction and
not be able to hop from one investigation to another, as Starr has
done. The alleged crimes should be committed during the target's
current government service and meet the Constitution's requirement
of acts that subvert the state or the American political system.
</P>
<P>
   To preclude partisanship, the attorney general and Congress
could agree at the start of each new administration on a list of
experienced prosecutors with reputations for independence. When
need be, a commission of bipartisan elder statesmen from all three
branches of government would appoint prosecutors from this pool.
</P>
<P>
   These revisions would endow the independent counsel statute with
some of the checks and balances and some of the accountability that
the framers of the Constitution created to shield citizens from the
overweening power of the state.

 &HT;    S.C. House votes to allow sale of driver's license photos
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ A state House committee voted Thursday to allow
a state agency to continue selling South Carolina driver's license
photos to a fraud prevention company, even as legislators and the
state's attorney general accused the company of invading peoples'
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Image Data President Bob Houvener rejected Attorney General
Charles Condon's request that the company ask drivers' permission
before it uses their photos in the check and credit card fraud
program it plans to roll out across South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am opposed because I do not think it would be cost
effective,'' Houvener told a legislative hearing crowded by South
Carolinians incensed that their photos might someday appear on a
screen in the check-out line at local stores.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby in the Blatt legislative building, the House Ways and
Means Committee renewed the state Department of Public Safety's
authority to sell photos to Nashua, N.H.-based Image Data, a small
privately held company which last year paid $5,000 for the
information on 3.5 million South Carolina driver's licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative approval is required for the contract to remain in
effect. Image Data downloads driver's license information from a
state data base as part of the company's test of its fraud
prevention system in several South Carolina stores.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans a statewide roll out of its program this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuffed by the governors in Flordia and Colorado, Image Data
has ignited a privacy controversy in South Carolina. Gov. Jim
Hodges has refused to break Image Data's contract with the state
Department of Public Safety, fearing the state could be liable for
substantial legal damages.
</P>
<P>
   The state agency signed the deal with Image Data in January
1998, but the controversy arose only recently after news reports
that the company received nearly $1.4 million in start-up funds
from the Secret Service, the federal agency responsible for
fighting wire fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Houvener said neither the Secret Service nor any other agency or
business has access to Image Data's data base. But several
legislators and residents who attended Thursday's long, contentious
public hearing were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why South Carolina? We do not appreciate being an experimental
station,'' said state Rep. Chip Limestone (R-Charleston), who has
introduced a bill to stop the sale of driver's license information.
``Our citizens are not white mice.''
</P>
<P>
   Several speakers criticized state officials for cutting the deal
with Image Data, even though driver's license information is
available for sale to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Condon said he opposes the sale of driver's license photos on
constitutional grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do not draw the line, where will we end up next?'' he
said. ``Medical information, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past several weeks, more than 50,000 people have
contacted Image Data or the Department of Public Safety to ``opt
out'' of the Image Data program. According to Houvener, those
peoples' photos will not appear on a small check-out screen when
they write a check or use a credit card at a business using Image
Data's system.
</P>
<P>
   Houvener said the company's data base is secure from computer
hackers and that the company will not sell the driver's license
information to other companies. In the stores, the photos appear on
the screen for a few second, long enough for the clerk to match the
customer's face with the photo.
</P>
<P>
   ``No data base is secure,'' said Steven Yates, 41, a graduate
student at the University of South Carolina in Columbia who
attended the hearing.

THE LION IN WINTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   Winter lives. It seemed dead for most of the season, a
disappointment to people who like their climates strong.
</P>
<P>
   There was the Jan. 14 storm, sort of, dumping its small dose of
reality. But even that single-digit howler dissipated into a
60-degree melt the next day. ``Just kidding,'' said the season,
reclosing its eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The parade of sunny days with temperatures in the 40s and 50s
lulled the region into barometric ennui, accentuating the winter
blahs and crankiness over the small stuff of dry skin and drab
landscapes. Picking at chipping paint around baseboard heaters, a
person grumbled about the need to shift out of neutral and into the
dramatic sweep of spring chores.
</P>
<P>
   But then came Monday, fierce and raw, like an icicle between the
shoulder blades. No jokes this time _ the beast was awake, hungry,
and out for a long run. A forecast of ``snow later in the week''
meant only one thing.
</P>
<P>
   Media storm desks snapped into battle-ready position. This was
the big one of '99 _ and maybe the only one. Had it hit during the
record-breaking winter of '94, it would have been considered
routine, and the weather reporters might have sounded a bit tired.
</P>
<P>
   They thundered their news with the enthusiasm of sportscasters
covering a playoff week. ``Baltimore is completely out of it!'' one
TV meteorologist announced, dismissing the Orioles with a wave of
his hand and closing his fist around Red Sox Nation. The words
``wallop,'' ``punch,'' and ``pounding'' rumbled through the
reports, deepening the angst of the listener, who was not only
expecting the worst from the weather but dreading a Boston season
without Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``A beaster of a nor'easter,'' predicted the Bell Atlantic
forecaster, and he was right. The small stuff is off the radar
screen. The mind is absorbed by the bigness of a landscape
transformed. As many times as a person has seen this whitewashing
of the world, it still amazes.
</P>
<P>
   Winter lives, and in opening the spirit to full contemplation of
its brutal splendor, so do we.

GREECE'S CONTRARY CONDUCT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following their military defeat in 1922, after having attacked
the Turks, the Greeks executed six Cabinet ministers whom they
thought responsible for the humiliating failure. One was brought on
a stretcher to the execution ground, being too sick to walk.
Another died of a heart attack in the van taking him from his
prison cell. The sick and the dead were propped up alongside the
others and shot.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, national humiliation did not carry such a high
price. In the debacle of Greece's attempt to aid the Kurdish
terrorist Abdullah Ocalan, only three Cabinet ministers and the
intelligence chief were asked to step down, and none was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Of key importance is the fact that the four were sacked not
because they had been involved with hiding an internationally
wanted terrorist or for trying to harm a neighboring country and
NATO ally. They were forced to resign because they had not secured
a terrorist's escape from justice and because they had failed to
hurt their country's NATO partner, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   If the Turkish version of Ocalan's confessions can be believed,
Greece has been helping to train and arm Kurdish fighters loyal to
Ocalan's PKK, the Kurdish Workers Party, who have been responsible
for killing thousands. ``They even gave us arms and rockets,''
Ocalan, now in Turkish custody, is quoted in the Turkish press as
saying. ``Greek officers gave guerrilla training and explosives
training to our militants.''
</P>
<P>
   It cannot be confirmed independently that Ocalan actually said
those words, nor can outsiders know the circumstances surrounding
his confession. But at the very least, Greece's actions in the
Ocalan affair ought to be debated in the councils of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and condemned by the United States and
its European allies.

MANDELA'S PROBABLE REPLACEMENT CALLS FOR ANOTHER AMNESTY PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said
Thursday that South Africa should consider a new round of amnesties
for apartheid-era human rights violators who had ignored the chance
to confess all to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of new amnesties has been rumored for months,
since the Truth Commission issued a 3,000-page report on the
country's violent past. The report cites evidence that dozens of
political leaders from all parties were involved in atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Many never applied for amnesty, and in theory they are now
supposed to be prosecuted. But many South Africans say such trials
would be politically divisive and in some cases would lead to more
violence, particularly in volatile KwaZulu/Natal.
</P>
<P>
   When the Truth Commission was created in 1995, it was hoped that
the vast majority of those guilty of atrocities would come forward,
confess their crimes and be given amnesty. This was seen as a
compromise, a way to unearth the horrors of the past without the
expense and difficulty of Nuremberg-style trials.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the commission forced the nation to see the gruesome
details of its history, as sobbing survivors and some of the worst
torturers told their stories. But far fewer of the violators came
forward than expected. Many simply gambled that cases against them
could not be made, or that the country would grow weary of the past
and not pursue them.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to Parliament, Mbeki, who is virtually assured of
becoming South Africa's next president when Nelson Mandela retires
this year, said a general amnesty could never be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   But he said specific proposals for amnesties for those involved
in the political violence in KwaZulu/Natal and for former generals
of the South African army should be considered, if the country
wants to ensure peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serious consideration will have to be given to insuring that
we do not allow ourselves to be drawn into a situation of conflict
as a result of the political crimes of the past,'' Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
   He gave no specifics on how such amnesties would work. Under the
Truth Commission, applicants had to tell all and show a political
motive for their actions to qualify for amnesty. The commission is
still hearing some applications that were submitted before the
commission's 1997 deadline, but it is scheduled to finish its work
this summer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mbeki's address came as Parliament debated the commission's
report and considered its proposals for reparations. Mandela spoke
first, echoing the commission's own proposal that the country fix a
time limit on any prosecutions for past atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford, as a nation and as a government, to be
saddled with unending judicial processes, which can easily bog down
our current efforts to resolve problems of the present,'' Mandela
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki took up different issues. In his speech, he suggested that
the Truth Commission's promises to victims would not be kept. The
commission had recommended that victims who registered with the
commission be given payments of about $1,000 a year for five years.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of the governing African National Congress say the
country cannot afford such payments.
</P>
<P>
   While the two speeches did not contradict each other, Mbeki was
far harsher in his critique of the Truth Commission. He had sought
to block the report before it was published because, he said, the
ANC had been denied a chance to rebut statements in the report.
Truth Commission officials said the party had been given repeated
chances but had failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Mbeki lashed out at the commission for equating
the atrocities committed by those in the liberation movement with
those of the former white supremacist government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot accept such a conclusion,'' he said, ``nor will the
millions of people who joined in the struggle to end the system of
apartheid.''

PESKY PESTICIDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The endless war between agriculture and the insect world
requires a delicate balance between the immediate gains offered by
chemicals in warding off bugs and the potential risks from eating
pesticide residues along with the fruit and vegetables. Consumers
Union, the watchdog organization, has urged additional caution by
producers and users of pesticides about some foods, especially for
children. Federal regulatory agencies have to step up monitoring
and review standards for tolerable levels of consumption.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, published in the March issue of the organization's
magazine Consumer Reports, found no glaring violations of legal
limits on a variety of pesticides but did raise concern that some
produce skirted the limits. It warned that children, who eat
proportionally more fruit and vegetables than adults, are more
vulnerable to damage because of their developing nervous systems.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers Union has a number of practical suggestions. Prominent
among them is that people continue to eat fresh produce because of
the nutrients they provide but that precautions be used, such as
washing and peeling fruits like apples, peaches, and pears. It also
recommends against giving large quantities of certain foods to
small children: peaches, winter squash, apples, spinach. And it
suggests organically grown produce, which has little or no
pesticide residues.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that much more work needs to be done to develop less
toxic pesticides and to fine- tune the quantities needed to protect
crops. Expanded inspections during various phases of growing and
distribution are important because many pesticides break down to
harmless components with time but should not reach consumers while
still potent. More inspections would reinforce consumer confidence
in an area where doubts and fears can undermine healthy diets.
</P>
<P>
   American food production and distribution are astonishingly
efficient, and great strides have been made in making food safer.
Experience and hard work can extend those gains _ but there must be
close attention to detail all along the chain.

 &HT;    Baptist leader's fate in Florida jury's hands
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARGO, Fla. _ Hands clasped as they stood in a circle outside
the courtroom, supporters of the Rev. Henry Lyons sang and prayed
for the Baptist leader's earthly redemption Thursday as a jury
began deliberating his fate on racketeering charges.
</P>
<P>
   The six-person, all-white panel broke for the day after about
three hours' work, saying they had reached no verdict. They will
resume deliberating this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, Lyons joined in the prayer circle with
his co-defendant, Bernice Edwards, and about 30 supporters, many
from the National Baptist Convention USA. Lyons is president of the
group, one of the largest African-American denominations in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need you to work on their minds,'' the Rev. Charles Emery
of the Pilgrim Baptist Church in Gary, Ind., prayed, referring to
the jury. ``We need you to get in their hearts. This is an
urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   The group sang the hymn ``What a Friend We Have in Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons and Edwards, formerly the group's public relations
director, are charged with stealing some $4 million from companies
wanting to do business with the convention. Prosecutors allege they
were having an affair and spent much of the money on luxury items
that included a waterfront home, a Lake Tahoe time-share
condominium, expensive cars, jewelry and furs.
</P>
<P>
   During her testimony, Edwards staunchly denied any romantic
involvement with Lyons. After the prayer circle broke up, she
clasped hands with Lyons' wife, Deborah, who touched off the
scandal in July 1997 when she set several small fires in the
$700,000 waterfront home her husband had purchased with Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   The fires led to a flood of media accounts and separate criminal
probes by state and federal prosecutors. Both Lyons and Edwards
face a federal trial later this year on charges that include
extortion, money laundering and income tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   As the scandal unfolded, many convention officials rallied to
Lyons' side, although some called on him to resign. A hurried
investigation by a convention committee found Lyons had done
nothing wrong and that no convention money was missing.
</P>
<P>
   But state investigators found plenty of documents they felt
justified the charges. Through witnesses, they showed Lyons and
Edwards took huge checks from insurance, credit card and burial
services companies, depositing the money in what prosecutors
described as ``secret accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who was on probation for embezzlement at the time,
opened accounts under five different Social Security numbers and
violated her probation by keeping the accounts secret, prosecutors
allege.
</P>
<P>
   Executives for the companies _ which include Globe Insurance of
Oklahoma, the Loewen Group of Canada and Union Planters Bank of
Nashville _ allege they were duped into believing the pair could
provide a mailing list of the convention's members, who supposedly
numbered 8.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   There was no such list, several witnesses testified, although
Edwards and others scrambled unsuccessfully to provide one.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys contend the pair broke no laws, but simply
participated in what turned out to be failed business deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case really should be about corporate deals that didn't
work out,'' attorney Grady Irvin said in his closing statement.
``Not enough profit was made by the corporations. But nobody held a
gun to their head.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons and Edwards could each face up to 30 years in prison if
convicted.

STOPPARD'S SMART, SENSUAL PASSAGE TO INDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN WINN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO &LR;   &LR; _ ``It's your country,'' the English poet says
to the Indian painter in 1930, ``and we've got it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the paradox at the heart of ``Indian Ink,'' Tom
Stoppard's play about the stamp of British colonialism on 20th
century India. It received its American premiere Wednesday in an
American Conservatory Theater production at the Geary Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Both the 1995 script and director Carey Perloff's three-hour
staging of it have their faults. But even when Stoppard is working
below the standard of ``Arcadia,'' a work this one strongly echoes,
he can do more things at once than any other living playwright.
That's recommendation enough for a rewarding night at the theater.
</P>
<P>
   The action centers on free-spirited Flora Crewe (Susan Gibney),
a poet who travels from England to India for her health. There she
meets the diffident painter Nirad Das (Art Malik), who's drawn to
her immediately and wants to do her portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a technique reminiscent of ``Arcadia,'' a second
set of characters observes and interprets the events 50 years
later. The characters share stage space and furniture. Loy Arcenas'
set surrounds and sometimes dwarfs them with its shuttling panels
and architectural fragments.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Stapleton plays Flora's sister Eleanor, now 75 in the
mid-1980s. She entertains two guests with vested interests in her
sister's past.
</P>
<P>
   Eldon Pike (Ken Grantham) is a fumbling Flora Crewe scholar who
proves Stoppard's epigram that ``biography is the worst possible
excuse for getting people wrong.'' His reading of Flora's letters,
which he footnotes aloud, links the two halves of ``Indian Ink.''
Firdous Bamji, in a tenderly nuanced performance, plays Eleanor's
other tea table guest, the son of Nirad and a painter himself.
</P>
<P>
   The play's mystery, more ruminative and less compelling than the
one that drives ``Arcadia,'' turns on a portrait that may have been
done of Flora in the nude. History's not about to give up its
secrets too easily, a recurring theme in the playwright's work.
</P>
<P>
   Stoppard links his two narratives to spin out a complex pattern
of lives and cultures fatefully intertwined. ``Indian Ink'' is
smart and sensual, mournful and funny, caustic and hopeful,
leisurely and issue-packed. It's awfully hard to get all that
right, and the experience for the audience is at once stimulating
and a little stiff.
</P>
<P>
   ACT's production, which was still coming together Wednesday,
doesn't mine everything in Stoppard's script. It also bungles some
of the playwright's carefully calibrated rhythms. But it gets the
key relationship right.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Gibney gives a sly, sexy and lyrical performance as the
heroine. The slim actress, in tightly crimped curls, seems to sell
Flora's eccentric fervor too hard at first. But the performance
ripens beautifully and gives everything Flora does a magnetic hold:
the lustrous voice-overs of the poems, the way she gleefully
wriggles her bare toes, her terrible wilting in the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Art Malik reprises his London role as Nirad. With his mix of
boisterous enthusiasm for all things English _ he loves London,
Shakespeare and Agatha Christie _ his demure demeanor and
reservoirs of passion hidden behind his cryptic looks, he's a
formidable match for her.
</P>
<P>
   In delicate counterpoint, the two explore everything from
customs in the British Raj to political insurrection, cultural
determinism, artistic inspiration and the ``color'' of erotic love.
A crisis breaks into their wide-ranging conversations when Flora,
struggling for breath, sheds her clothes and retreats to a
gauze-draped bed. It's a breathless, erotically charged moment, a
spasm of deep feeling played with great truthfulness by both
actors.
</P>
<P>
   Stoppard's dialogue is at once heady and droll, and it demands
sparkling delivery. A miscast Stapleton falls short of the mark.
Her character has some of the most delicious lines, and her rattled
spontaneity scores laughs. But Eleanor's measured wit breaks down
in Stapleton's erratic timing and poor projection.
</P>
<P>
   Grantham had his share of fumbled lines on opening night, and
this normally reliable actor never quite hit his stride as the
obtuse editor of Flora's letters. Things improve in his scenes with
Anil Kumar, who plays Eldon's ebullient companion in India.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indian Ink'' is a kind of mural of English-Indian relations,
with gin-swilling colonials, coyly deferential servants, a romantic
English pragmatist (David Conrad), a sybaritic Rajah (Shelly Desai)
and word of Gandhi on the march against the salt tax. The
characters are never the simple emblems they seem.
</P>
<P>
   It's Stoppard's ``Passage to India'' _ Flora and Nirad discuss
E.M. Forster's novel at one point _ a study of two cultures
struggling to connect even as they're about to come apart. What the
Indians consider ``rebellion'' the English see as ``mutiny.'' The
imperialist English language is also, paradoxically, the path to a
nationalist independence.
</P>
<P>
   In its final fluid movement, ``Indian Ink'' rises to a kind of
theatrical grace. First Flora bids farewell to Nirad, a moment too
heightened for them to look each other in the eye. Then time
flashes back to Flora and her young sister (Roxanne Raja) at a
bittersweet beginning. It's a long and sometimes jerky ride to get
here, but the company rides out on one of those soaring reveries
that are precious, unmistakable Stoppard.

</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trade association for managed care companies has taken a
major step toward greater protection for patients enrolled in HMOs.
The association's support for outside review of medical decisions
in dispute ought to form the basis of a compromise bill that
Congress can pass this year.
</P>
<P>
   The ``statement of principles'' by the American Association of
Health Plans is merely advisory, but it does signal an awareness of
the need to reassure patients that they are not being denied
necessary treatment. The association wants a way to ``provide fast,
fair, and efficient review of medical evidence by medical experts
that are independent of health plans and physician associations.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement follows a decision by Aetna US Healthcare, with 16
million members, to set up an external review procedure, a
precedent that ought to guide the actions of other plans. In the
Boston area, Harvard Pilgrim has a mechanism in place, and Blue
Cross's will be ready this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The association issued its statement while meeting in Washington
to discuss congressional attempts to regulate the plans, which it
fought last year. With support for the concept widespread in
Congress, opposition will be difficult to sustain.
</P>
<P>
   The chief point in dispute is whether patients will be allowed
to sue the plans. Lawsuits are an unwieldy weapon to improve
medical care, since they rarely succeed unless a patient has
already suffered grievous harm.
</P>
<P>
   Health plans are especially worried about the huge settlements
that can sometimes result from the imposition of ``punitive
damages,'' penalties over and above the actual harm done by the
faulty decision. Rhode Island's Senator John Chafee and six other
senators have filed a bill that would allow patients to sue only
for actual damages. This plan might form the basis of a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Several other issues, from emergency care to guidelines on the
use of prescription drugs, need to be thrashed out before a bill is
ready for approval. The health plan association has shown, in the
words of its president, Karen Ignagni, that ``we want to be part of
the discussion.''

A GOOD COMPROMISE ON KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   American diplomats devoted considerable time and energy to the
mission of imposing a peace agreement on Serbia and a delegation of
Albanian Kosovars who convened at the chateau of Rambouillet in
France. It is understandable that Clinton administration officials
seek to portray the outcome of the conference as postponed success
rather than a diplomatic failure.
</P>
<P>
   It may not have been a success, but to be fair, it was not a
failure, either. American diplomatic persistence did persuade
Yugoslavia's President Slobodan Milosevic to accept genuine
autonomy for the Serb province of Kosovo, although the delay allows
Milosevic to portray himself as having once again outmaneuvered the
West.
</P>
<P>
   This is a crucial step, since the cause of the carnage in Kosovo
traces back to Milosevic's annulment of Kosovo's autonomy in 1989
and a subsequent wave of Serbian repression against ethnic
Albanians who form 90 percent of the province's population. The
political part of the accord that Milosevic accepted grants the
Albanian Kosovars their own parliament, their own government, their
own judiciary, and their own police force.
</P>
<P>
   These concessions do not add up to the independence for which
commanders of the Kosovo Liberation Army had been fighting, but
they do answer the real needs of the Albanian population and set
the province on the road to independence at some indeterminate time
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   If these elements of autonomy are implemented and a NATO
peacekeeping force is able to prevent a renewal of warfare between
Serbs and the KLA, not only will Albanian villages be protected,
but the Albanian majority will gain the opportunity to form the
political and administrative institutions of a self-governing
people.
</P>
<P>
   If they are wise, the inexperienced young commanders of the KLA
will take the deal. If Milosevic is wise, he will drop his
opposition to allowing NATO peacekeepers to oversee the disarming
of the KLA. As President Clinton has shrewdly observed, this
bargain allows Kosovo to remain a part of Serbia by taking Serbia
out of Kosovo.

A SMILE FROM THE GRAVE: CHARLIE O. TOLD THEM SO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The late Charles O. Finley, renegade baseball owner of another
era, loved nothing better than being different. Particularly when
he could be different and also end up being right.
</P>
<P>
   Although lone gone, Finley left behind a told-you-so legacy that
continues to haunt baseball.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '70s, when the new players' union was considered
more pest than today's beast, Finley constantly yelped to the
heavens on one point.
</P>
<P>
   Give the players all the free agency they want, he said, but
don't, under any circumstances, cave in on salary arbitration. The
worry by others, however, was strictly about free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Once the original Basic Agreement was hammered out between the
owners and the up-start union, arbitration was included. Finley,
owner of the Oakland A's, cast the lone vote against it.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward 30 years, and listen to what Rangers president Tom
Schieffer said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Arbitration is the worst thing we do in baseball. It's nothing
but a destructive process.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley called this calamity long ago, except no one in his era
was listening. Not listening is now a very costly mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The latest scorecard on arbitration was made public this week.
Sixty-two players filed for arbitration and collected a record 169
percent pay increase. Out of 11 cases actually heard by
arbitrators, the owners ``won'' nine, but in all nine the players
received raises. Salaries for those who filed rose from an average
of $781,000 to an average of $2,009,000.
</P>
<P>
   Home-run king Mark McGwire, noting the massive salary gains for
players in both free agency and arbitration, spoke the unthinkable
this week.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire wondered aloud if a repeat of the disastrous shutdown of
'94 wasn't coming in 2001, when the current Basic Agreement
expires. Privately, most in baseball, players and owners, think so.
</P>
<P>
   The outta-sight salaries of today are fueled by many factors,
not the least being a handful of team owners who create financial
havoc for the others. But the engine that drives the entire salary
process is arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   It works like this _ free agency is granted to a player with six
years of major-league service. But a player can be
arbitration-eligible after two years and a 100 days of time.
Shortstop Derek Jeter won an arbitration case against the Yankees
last week, making him a $5 million player after just three years in
the majors.
</P>
<P>
   With the same production on the field, Jeter will be a $10
million player, minimum, before he's eligible for free agency. And
how high does it go from there?
</P>
<P>
   The player has two shots at the owners when it comes to running
up the salary _ arbitration and then free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free agency, we can control by either not signing a player or
releasing a player who is eligible for free agency,'' said
Schieffer. ``But there is no control on arbitration. The arbitrator
is looking at numbers and comparative salaries. We lose on
comparative salaries, and will then lose again when it comes to
free agency.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed outrageous when Rangers pitcher Aaron Sele asked last
month for a $6.2 million paycheck in 1999. The Rangers offered $4.8
million, more than fair.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of allowing an arbitrator to decide, the club
settled with Sele for a club-record $5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no guarantee we could win the case,'' said general
manager Doug Melvin, ``not based on other salaries this
off-season.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the team ``wins'' an arbitration case it only means its
salary offer doubled or even tripled what the player previously
made. There is no ``lose'' for the player.
</P>
<P>
   And what can result are hard feelings by the player over an
arbitration hearing. As good as Jeter is, he complained about
hearing the Yankees talk of his negatives before an arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been preached the owners should finally follow the
advice of Finley and do everything to eliminate arbitration. But
they blew their chance in '94.
</P>
<P>
   In the shutdown nastiness five years ago, the union agreed to
give up arbitration, if free agency would be reduced to four years
of service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our club was all for it,'' said Schieffer. ``but the
small-market clubs opposed it, saying they needed the extra two
years to hold on to players. But arbitration makes the numbers so
out of whack, they can't hold the players anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 2001 season, the new Basic Agreement with the union
will be negotiated. ``I think then you'll see the end of
arbitration,'' predicted Schieffer.
</P>
<P>
   By listening to Charles Finley long ago, the problem would never
have existed.

REVOLUTION LOSE IN EXHIBITION, 3-1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MODENA, Italy _ The Revolution seemed on the right track in
preseason training before Thursday. But after a 3-1 defeat against
Modena, some of the team's weaknesses became apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution back line was quickly dissected by Modena's
reserves, as Mauro Nardini converted in the third minute.
Revolution player-coach Walter Zenga had no chance to stop the shot
as 19-year-old Massimiliano Zanoli sent a diagonal ball through the
defense and Nardini went in alone.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Burns tied the score in the 31st minute, scoring off a
turnover caused by the Revolution's pressing style, his leftfooted
shot deflecting in off a defender. By then, the Revolution had
regained some control, as well as the interest of several hundred
spectators who had arrived for the afternoon exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Rocha, who had missed with an impressive first-minute
drive, attracted attention with a bicycle kick pass to Jair that
elicited a chant of ``Maradona'' from the crowd and later with a
scissors kick that went wide.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga departed to an ovation after 30 minutes, and replacement
Anthony Latronica was caught outside the penalty area after a
restart as the Revolution surrendered a penalty kick in the 40th
minute. Nardini converted again for a 2-1 halftime edge.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution squandered what would be their last chance to
stay in contention as Jair skimmed the bar after penetrating to the
end line late in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Modena, among the top teams in Serie C1, took control in the
second half. Coach Paolo Stringara, a former Zenga teammate at
Inter, used his starters, and they dominated against the Revolution
first team and reserves, who entered in force in the 62d minute.
</P>
<P>
   Davide Carrus, a 19-year-old Sardinian, headed in a corner past
goalkeeper Jeff Causey in the 69th minute. And the Revolution
displayed little countering ability, except for an impressive
dribble by Ze Rodrigues that resulted in a free kick.
</P>
<P>
   This was a rough match, and Jair, Rocha, and Giovanni Savarese
all were temporarily incapacitated early in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution soon will have to make some decisions
defensively. The flat back four has appeared vulnerable, but the
defenders must be given time to coordinate. Zenga still seems to
possess transcendent abilities in goal, but has played a total of
only 90 minutes in three contests.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution played the equivalent of two games in less than
24 hours, after Joe-Max Moore's free kick goal had made the
difference in a 1-0 victory over Polisportiva Concordiese Wednesday
night. Polisportiva seemed less cohesive than Modena, which is in
late-season form and contending for a place in Serie B.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is going to be on the defense, and that's the way
it should be,'' defender Dan Calichman said. ``Would we like to
have a guy who can run the 40 (yards) in 4.4 (seconds)? Yeah. I'd
like to be able to run that fast. But we have five or six good
defenders. And the important thing is that you have three, or four,
or five guys who are good players and who believe in each other.
Once you establish that, you can work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to work together as a unit. You have to know each
other's movements. That takes more than two weeks, more than a
month. But it's a long season and you will see our best play as the
season gets going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution will take a 1-2-3 preseason record into an
exhibition against a Ukranian opponent Monday.

IOC TO DISCUSS MORE EXPULSIONS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The beleaguered International Olympic Committee begins deciding
this weekend whether to expel another dozen or more members in what
is already the worst scandal in modern Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's six-man investigative panel will meet at Olympic
headquarters in Switzerland to weigh more evidence of wrongdoing by
IOC members submitted recently by the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee as well as numerous bid cities for five other Games.
</P>
<P>
   Though four members have already resigned and another five have
been forced out for taking improper payoffs or gifts from the Salt
Lake City bidders for the 2002 Winter Games, another 10 were
implicated earlier this month and more names are expected to
surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many? I don't know,'' said IOC vice president Richard
Pound of Canada, who chairs the panel. ``It's kind of a movable
feast at the moment. The number of cities we've heard from is in
the teens and some are still coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the IOC has vowed to clean house definitively at its
special session on March 17-18 in Lausanne, the inquiry panel plans
to finish its work Sunday and make an immediate report to the
executive board, which will vote to expel, warn, or exonerate those
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to give the members as much notice as we can,''
said Pound. ``Anybody who may be subject to expulsion would want an
opportunity to get ready to defend himself.''
</P>
<P>
   A 300-page report issued this month by the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee's ethics panel unveiled a second wave of members who
allegedly took cash and gifts: Seiuli Paul Wallwork of Western
Samoa, Shagdarjav Magvan of Mongolia, Austin Sealy of Barbados,
Phillip Coles of Australia, Anani Matthia of Togo, Ashwini Kumar of
India, Ram Ruhee of Mauritius, Willi Kaltschmitt of Guatemala, and
Mohamed Zerguini of Algeria. The report also provided fresh details
about executive board member Kim Un-yong of South Korea and Louis
Guirandou-N'Diaye of Ivory Coast, who were already under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The payoffs ranged from a $100,000 job for Kim's son to a
$30,000 loan to Wallwork's wife to $3,000 monthly payments to Sealy
to Super Bowl trips for Coles and Kaltschmitt. The Nagano bidders
also forwarded names of nine IOC members who took multiple vacation
trips to Japan at Nagano's expense; other cities have said they
provided gifts far in excess of the $150 limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's inappropriate? It's like saying I can't define
obscenity, but I know it when I see it,'' Pound said. ``If you get
a gift that's $151, that's clearly not a problem. If you get a
Mercedes, that clearly is.''
</P>
<P>
   Coles, who has vigorously denied wrongdoing, and one or two
other members are expected to appear in person before the panel.
They and others will also have a chance to explain themselves next
month to the executive board and to the full body, which is
expected to expel any guilty members who have not stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   Pound also said that the investigative panel would quickly
exonerate any members it found blameless. ``We don't want this
thing to be hanging over the heads of IOC members who are not
guilty of anything,'' he said.

BUSH SETS DATE TO SET UP COMMITTEE TO SET UP CAMPAIGN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Texas, Tenn. )   By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After months of ruminating publicly about whether
he planned to seek the Republican Presidential nomination, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas has decided to embark on a campaign and
will take the first step of establishing an exploratory committee
in two weeks, his advisers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt he's going to file the exploratory
committee,'' Karl Rove, a top Bush adviser, said in a telephone
interview from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a contrast to former Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, who
dithered for months about running for president in 1992, then
backed out, Rove insisted that Bush was not about to turn back.
``We haven't been Mario-ized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, at a news conference in Austin Thursday, made clear that
an announcement was imminent. ``In two weeks, I'll make an
announcement,'' Bush said. ``So I'll see you in two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he had decided, Bush replied, ``If I told you what
I'd announce, you wouldn't even show up.''
</P>
<P>
   He is widely viewed by Republicans as the candidate to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said Bush could not put off assembling an exploratory
committee any longer because he needed one to finance his initial
steps toward setting up a presidential campaign, like travel and
staffing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's move helps give shape to the Republican field. Sen.
Robert Smith of New Hampshire formally announced his candidacy last
week. Pat Buchanan, the conservative commentator, said Thursday
that he would make his announcement on Tuesday in Manchester, N.H.
The week after that, former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee is
expected to formally begin his campaign. A half-dozen others are
campaigning but have yet to make formal declarations.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Bush said he would probably make his official
announcement of candidacy some time after the Texas Legislature
adjourns at the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has long been expected to run, he encouraged the
naysayers over the past year by repeatedly citing concerns about
the toll the White House would take on his two daughters. In an
interview three weeks ago, Bush insisted that he was struggling
with a decision, saying: ``My conflict is making a decision that
will commit my family to what I've called the meat grinder of
Washington life. I've got girls who would be entering college. It's
less to do with me and more to do with my family. I love those
little girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Reed, who ran the 1996 campaign of Bob Dole, the
Republican nominee, said Bush's talk about his family, while
genuine, was also ``a thoughtful delay tactic to do things on his
own time line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, the Bush team has learned that you need to put
filler out there or the void will be filled by somebody else,''
Reed added. ``Since Jan. 1, he's really dictated and dominated the
agenda in Republican politics.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush is drawing on some of the past lieutenants of his
father, former President George Bush, his informal network of
advisers also includes conservative Republicans from the Reagan
era.
</P>
<P>
   The advisers include Condoleezza Rice, who was a Bush
administration foreign policy adviser, and Paul Wolfowitz, who
worked in the State and Defense department posts in the Reagan and
Bush administrations. His economic advisers include Martin
Feldstein, a professor at Harvard, and Lawrence Lindsey, who was on
President Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers and later
was appointed to the Federal Reserve by President Bush. Mayor
Stephen Goldsmith of Indianapolis has been advising Bush on
domestic matters.

 &HT;    Bush says he will speak on candidacy in 2 weeks
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A day after sources close to Gov. George W. Bush
said he has decided to form an exploratory committee that will be
the precursor to a full-blown presidential campaign, the governor
confirmed Thursday that he will make an announcement in two weeks.
He declined to give details of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will deal with all the issues related to my future in a
couple of weeks,'' Bush said. ``Prepare yourself for a day of
announcement in a couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Word is that Bush will announce the formation of the exploratory
committee and say that means he has decided ``maybe'' to run for
president. The ``maybe'' is for public consumption. All signs
indicate the Bush presidential candidacy, to be formally announced
in June, is a go. On Thursday, Bush's noncampaign picked up support
from a group of leading GOP elected officials in Alabama, including
Attorney General Bill Pryor, Lt. Gov. Steve Windom and Secretary of
State Jim Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   TEACHERS BACK CLASS-ACTION SUITS
</P>
<P>
   Two Dallas teachers who benefited from a class-action lawsuit
urged a Senate subcommittee Thursday not to limit such lawsuits.
Donna and Billy Davis told the panel that they had put nearly
$90,000 in annuities at an Austin insurance company, which then
refused to pay interest on their money. They told the panel,
chaired by Sen. Troy Fraser (R-Horseshoe Bay) that they would have
been out of luck without joining a class action filed on behalf of
thousands of other teachers taken in by the company's sales pitch.
In the end, their insurance agent spent three years trying to get
action by the Texas Department of Insurance before finding a lawyer
to act for them.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was considering a bill by Sen. Teel Bivins
(R-Amarillo) that would channel class actions through state
regulatory agencies before they go to trial. Supporters say it
would allow problems to be solved without going to court.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee did not vote on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   TESTIMONY GIVEN ON EPHEDRINE
</P>
<P>
   The dietary supplement ephedrine is risky and should be
regulated like a prescription drug, not just marketed with warning
labels and recommended dosage limits, doctors told the Texas Board
of Health on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not food additives. These are drugs,'' said Dr.
Donald Gordon, chairman of the department of emergency medical
technology at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of ephedrine products _ which offer weight loss
and an energy boost _ say proposed rules that require warning
labels and recommended daily limits are sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you get too much ephedrine? Absolutely,'' said Ruth Ann
Box, chief general counsel for Dallas-based dietary supplement
marketer AdvoCare. ``When I get a headache, I don't take 50
aspirin. I don't want to die. These regulations are the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   State health officials heard three hours of testimony on
ephedrine Thursday and are expected to decide in June whether to
adopt the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE PASSES ID-POSSESSION BILL
</P>
<P>
   Possessing someone else's ID without their permission with the
intent of committing fraud would be punishable by up to two years
in state jail under a bill approved by the Senate on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Corona, R-Dallas, said it's already a crime to misuse
someone else's identity. But it's not a crime to possess another
person's identifying information.
</P>
<P>
   ``As technological developments continue to automate our
financial transactions, the threat to our wallets is no longer the
pickpocket or purse-snatcher on the street, but rather the criminal
intercepting our mail or using a computer to assume our identity
and obtain access to our credit,'' Corona said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill now goes to the House.
</P>
<P>
   HEPATITIS TEST BILL GOES TO HOUSE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday signed off on a bill to allow hospitals
to test patients for hepatitis B and C, even without patients'
permission, if a hospital worker has been exposed to those
patients' blood or bodily fluids.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Corona, R-Dallas and sponsor of the bill, said
hospitals can already test patients' blood for HIV/AIDS without
permission in similar situations. He said tests for hepatitis are
also needed.
</P>
<P>
   On a voice vote, the Senate sent the bill to the House.

COMMENTARY: AMAZON.YOU 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Testifying before Congress Tuesday, Alan Greenspan wouldn't
exactly come out and say that there was a little irrational
exuberance behind some of the Internet stocks, but he said these
share prices had reached levels that gave him ``concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, if you really want to be ``concerned'' about the levels of
some of these profitless Internet stocks, such as Amazon.com, you
should pay less attention to Greenspan and more attention to what's
going on in a small house in Cedar Falls, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   There, a single Iowa family, headed by Lyle Bowlin, is
re-creating Amazon.com in a spare bedroom. I tell you this not
because they're an immediate threat to Amazon.com, but to
underscore just how easy it is to compete against Amazon.com, and
why therefore I'm dubious that Amazon and many other Internet
retailers will ever generate the huge profits that their stock
prices suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle Bowlin is the director of the Small Business Development
Center at the University of Northern Iowa. He is also a book lover.
But having grown up in small Iowa towns, he has always regretted
that he never had access to a good independent bookstore, with lots
of titles. When the Internet and Amazon.com came along, said
Bowlin, ``I realized that in my spare time I could create a virtual
independent bookstore.''
</P>
<P>
   So first he set up a commercial Web site _
www.positively-you.-com. Then he contacted the very same book
wholesalers that Amazon.com uses and discovered something
interesting _ that to get virtually the same volume discounts that
Amazon.com gets, all he needed to do was order five copies of any
particular book.
</P>
<P>
   The other accouterments were just as cheap: He pays an Internet
service provider, ACES, $30 a month to house his very colorful Web
site, and $30 a month to Americart to enable people to charge books
on their credit cards over a secure server line. He pays his bank
$50 a month to manage the credit card transactions, and has $40 a
month printing costs, largely for his own monthly book newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no employees,'' says Bowlin. ``My daughter does the
accounting, I maintain the Web site and my wife does the shipping.
Altogether, I only need to generate $150 a month in profits to
cover all my expenses, and the rest is cream.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he was set up for business, Bowlin just spread the word
among his neighbors, colleagues and friends that not only could he
offer them everything Amazon.com did, but he could do it cheaper
and make a profit from day one. He now has customers from 23 states
and Canada. It is funny to go to his Web site and see it offering
``Millions Of Books At Great Prices,'' knowing that it is all being
done out of his spare bedroom _ as a hobby!
</P>
<P>
   Here's the deal: Amazon.com offers ``The Testament,'' by John
Grisham, for 30 percent off retail ($19.57), plus $3.95 shipping
and handling. Bowlin sells it for 35 percent off ($18.17) and $2.75
shipping and handling _ $2.60 less. How? Like Amazon, Bowlin buys
``The Testament'' from the wholesaler for 44 percent off retail,
but since he has no overhead or advertising budget he can sell it
for 35 percent off. He can deliver the book through the U.S. Postal
Service within three days for only $1.63, so he makes $1.12 more on
shipping for each sale. Total profit: $3.65 per book.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, says Bowlin, ``when you charge a book, I collect your
money within a few days from Visa, but I don't have to pay my
wholesaler for that book for 30 days, so I have a free loan which I
earn interest on _ just like Amazon.''
</P>
<P>
   Because his profit margins are razor-thin, Bowlin, like Amazon,
needs repeat buyers. Amazon gets them by offering useful
information about books. Bowlin does it by offering any
government-certified nonprofit organization a donation of 10
percent of the purchase price of any book that any nonprofit or its
members buy through him.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time your broker tells you that this or that
Internet retailing stock is actually worth some crazy multiples,
just think for a moment about how many Lyle Bowlins there already
are out there, and how many more there will be, to eat away at the
profit margins of whatever Internet retailer you can imagine. It
only costs them $150 a month and they can do it as a hobby!
</P>
<P>
   Or think about it like this: For about the cost of one share of
Amazon.com, you can be Amazon.com.

FAST FILLIES MIGHT KEEP UP WITH COLTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ The San Rafael Stakes, a prep for a prep for
the Kentucky Derby, has extra significance this season as
handicappers try to compare the season's outstanding 3-year-old
fillies with their male counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   More than ever in recent memory, fillies are being included on
the lists of contenders for the May 1 Derby. When Churchill Downs
held the first parimutuel ``future-book'' wagering last weekend,
the fillies Excellent Meeting, Silverbulletday and Honest Lady were
among the 11 most heavily bet horses.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual for fillies to show ability comparable to colts
at age 2. Five times in the 15 Breeders' Cups, the Juvenile Fillies
winner ran as fast as or faster than the Juvenile winner under
identical conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But it's rare that fillies continue to run as fast as colts at
age 3, as they have this year. That's why only three fillies have
won the Derby in 124 runnings _ Regret (1915), Genuine Risk ('80)
and Winning Colors ('88).
</P>
<P>
   Gauged by Beyer speed figures _ which allow the comparison of
horses running different distances on different tracks on different
days _ three of the four fastest races by top Derby hopefuls were
recorded by Excellent Meeting (winning the Las Virgenes earlier
this month), Honest Lady (winning the Santa Ynez last month) and
Silverbulletday (winning a November stakes at Churchill).
</P>
<P>
   And although she hasn't been mentioned as a Derby prospect,
Olympic Charmer registered a speed figure in that class in her
maiden victory at Santa Anita in December.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, one reason the fillies are getting so much attention
is that none of the major Derby prep races has been run and only
Exploit among the colts has shown Triple Crown credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the colts are just getting cranked up (for the
season),'' said Bob Baffert, who trains Excellent Meeting and
Silverbulletday as well as Exploit and other top 3-year-old colts.
``You have to remember that these fillies haven't been facing the
toughest competition.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kent Desormeaux, the regular rider of both Excellent Meeting
and Honest Lady, said the fillies deserve the acclaim they're
getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're phenomenal. They're freaks,'' Desormeaux said. ``I
don't think it's what the colts don't possess, it's what the
fillies do possess.''
</P>
<P>
   We can judge for ourselves Sunday when the genders collide for
the first time this season in the San Rafael, which serves as a
prep for the April 3 Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The expected eight-horse field will include Honest Lady, one of
those hot fillies, and Prime Timber, one of Baffert's top colts.
Santa Anita morning-line writer Jeff Tufts said Thursday he'll
probably make Honest Lady a slight favorite even though no filly
has won the San Rafael and it's believed no filly has run in it
before.
</P>
<P>
   Honest Lady, a daughter of Seattle Slew and Toussaud who's
unbeaten in two starts, will be racing around two turns for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good timing because she'll have had five weeks since her
last race,'' said Bobby Frankel, who trains her for owner Aaron
Jones. ``And we won't have to run against Excellent Meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Timber, a son of Sultry Song who will be ridden by Gary
Stevens, will be racing for the first time since he finished a good
second to since-injured Tactical Cat in the Dec. 12 Hollywood
Futurity.
</P>
<P>
   Also expected for the $200,000 San Rafael: Aristotle, Capsized,
Buck Trout, Desert Hero, Lethal Instrument and Love that Red.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a clean race, a victory by Honest Lady will be
interpreted as a sign the fillies are as good as the colts this
year. Then it'll be up to their trainers to keep aiming for the
Derby or aim for the April 30 Kentucky Oaks against other fillies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of glad Frankel's filly is running in (the San
Rafael),'' said Baffert, who hopes the result will help him make up
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   64 days to the Derby: Horses on the rise: Vicar and Cat Thief
ran a close 1-2 in the Fountain of Youth at Gulfstream Park on
Saturday; Certain was third; Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner Answer
Lively improved on his '99 debut by running second to Ecton Park in
Louisiana; Baffert's Straight Man is aiming for the Gallery
Furniture.com Stakes (the former Jim Beam) on March 27 after
winning a late debut in 1:08.82; Apremont is 2 for 2 after winning
a 7-furlong allowance race at Santa Anita by five lengths over
Charismatic and Forestry; Exploit was the 6-1 favorite in the first
round of Churchill Downs future betting last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Horses on the decline: Maryland-based Millions' '99 debut is
delayed by illness; a fracture will sideline Louisiana prep-race
upsetter Some Actor for three or four months; The Groom is Red and
Doneraile Court ran poorly in the Fountain of Youth.
</P>
<P>
   Big 'Cap next: Silver Charm worked out for the March 6 Santa
Anita Handicap in tandem with Real Quiet on Wednesday, which might
be the first time Kentucky Derby winners have worked together.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm, with Stevens aboard, and Real Quiet, with Dana
Barnes, finished together in 1:25 2/5 for 7 furlongs. Baffert is
pointing Real Quiet for the March 7 New Orleans Handicap at the
Fair Grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm's Big 'Cap opponents are expected to include
Richard Mandella's Puerto Madero, Event of the Year and Malek, and
Free House and Dr Fong.
</P>
<P>
   The Big 'Cap hasn't attracted Eastern runners even though it's
part of the NTRA Champions on Fox series for older horses. Then
again, outside of Victory Gallop, what Eastern horses would it
want?
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Saturday's Gulfstream Park Handicap, which dropped in
value and prestige when the Donn Handicap joined the NTRA series,
has an all-Florida-based field led by Behrens and Sir Bear. &QL;

A REWARD FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO - With Luc Robitaille's overtime goal paving the way,
the Kings went from the doghouse to the penthouse on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And as a result, they never made it to Johnnie's Ice House, the
Chicago rink where they had been scheduled to practice Thursday in
preparation for tonight's game against the Chicago Blackhawks at
the United Center.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Kings had a light workout at a fitness center near
their Michigan Avenue hotel, then were free for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reward for playing well,'' said Kings coach Larry
Robinson, who hasn't often felt like rewarding his team this
season. ``And we're into February. How many hours have we spent on
the ice passing pucks and shooting pucks? We had as much of a
workout as we would have had on the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were coming off a 3-2 victory in which they rallied
from a two-goal third-period deficit against the two-time defending
Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings to win on Robitaille's
acrobatic goal.
</P>
<P>
   The victory drew the Kings (22-32-5) to within three points of
Calgary and Edmonton, which share the final playoff berth in the
NHL's Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as Robinson was pleased with the important victory,
he was just as happy that his players had stayed with his patient
game plan even when they fell into a 2-0 hole.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Robinson said, ``We've always strayed from it. Even
if we were only down one goal, we got away from it. We'd forget
about getting it deep, forget the game plan. You have to stick to
the game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when they trailed Wednesday, the Kings stayed calm,
forwards helping out in the defensive zone and consistently getting
the puck deep into the attacking zone. Eventually, they found
cracks in the Red Wings' defense and capitalized.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also got strong performances from the players they
count on most. Donald Audette and Glen Murray had seven shots
apiece, Rob Blake six and Robitaille five.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a pretty good team,'' Blake said, ``but we've got to
be disciplined every night.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Kings stay disciplined tonight, they'll have a good
chance to win again.
</P>
<P>
   They have won all three meetings with the Hawks this season and
seven in a row dating to last year. But Chicago will have a
different look tonight with new coach Lorne Molleken behind the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   Molleken had been an assistant coach with the Hawks until
Monday's firing of first-year coach Dirk Graham. In Molleken's
first game, the Hawks surprised the Blues in St. Louis, winning by
a 3-1 margin Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He already has won the favor of his players by freeing them
offensively from the patient dump-and-chase style Graham favored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to look at this as an opportunity and try to make a
step forward,'' Blackhawks center Doug Gilmour said. ``Our approach
has to be: Let's make something out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Visheau has surgery (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Mark Visheau, who has missed the last 10 games
because of a congenital urinary tract obstruction, underwent
successful surgery Wednesday night at Centinela Hospital Medical
Center in Inglewood.
</P>
<P>
   Visheau, 25, had four points and 107 penalty minutes in 28 games
this season. He will be sidelined for the rest of the year but is
expected to be ready for the start of next season.
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   An overlooked factor in the Kings' success in Detroit was
faceoffs. The Kings won 57 percent of them, with Ian Laperriere
winning five of eight and Yanic Perreault winning 12 of 18. ``It's
a huge part of the game, Robinson said. ... Robinson said he
probably will rotate defensemen Garry Galley and Philippe Boucher
in and out of the lineup the rest of the season, to keep both ready
in case of an injury or if one of the other defensemen is playing
poorly. He said he will do the same with enforcer Matt Johnson,
whose ice time has been sporadic recently.

ANTHONY NUTTING, WHOSE `NO' ON SUEZ COST HIS CAREER, DIES AT 79 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: England, Egypt, Israel, France, Spain)   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Anthony Nutting, a deputy foreign secretary who
sacrificed a potentially brilliant political career by resigning
over Britain's involvement in the 1956 attack on Suez, died of
heart failure at his home in London on Tuesday. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   He had been the youngest member of Winston Churchill's
government after World War II and was a rising figure in the
Conservative Party when he attended a fateful meeting of
high-ranking British and French officials on Oct. 14, 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Israel was about to attack Egypt, which under President Gamal
Abdel Nasser had nationalized the Suez Canal. Nutting learned at
the secret gathering that Prime Minister Anthony Eden, his mentor,
and the French had agreed that once fighting began they would send
in their own paratroopers. The public justification would be the
need to separate Israeli and Egyptian forces, but the true purpose,
the leaders agreed, would be to support Israel, seize the canal and
undermine Nasser.
</P>
<P>
   Nutting, who two years earlier negotiated the final steps of the
treaty with Nasser under which British troops withdrew from Suez,
believed that the mission was mistaken and deceitful. When British
planes took to the air on Oct. 31, he decided to quit. For security
reasons, he did not give the customary resignation speech to the
House of Commons, and his unexplained action proved so unpopular
that his constituents forced him to give up his seat in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Macmillan, who would later become prime minister himself,
had urged him not to resign, saying that ``you will lead the marty
one day.'' Instead, Nutting, at 36, found his political career in
ruins.
</P>
<P>
   He later wrote of feeling suddenly ``bereft of friends, a
castaway adrift on a sea of anger and recrimination, an object of
distrust, torn between loyalty to principle and loyalty to friends
and associates.''
</P>
<P>
   The British action ended up convulsing Parliament, speeding the
end of the Eden government, damaging the country's standing in the
United Nations, straining London's relationship with Washington and
complicating the West's attempt to obtain condemnation of the
Soviet invasion of Hungary days later.
</P>
<P>
   Nutting kept his silence until 1967 when in his book ``No End of
a Lesson'' he explained that backing the Suez action would have put
him in the position of lying to the House of Commons and the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either I had to tell the whole story as I saw it, or say
nothing at all,'' he wrote. ``And as long as any of the chief
protagonists of the Suez war still held high office in Britain, it
would clearly have been a grave disservice to the nation, which
they still led and represented in the councils of the world, to
have told the whole story.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Anthony Nutting was born into a wealthy family in 1920
with estates in England and Scotland, and he was educated at Eton
and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied agriculture and
kept a pack of hounds. He was unable to serve in World War II
because of a steeplechasing injury, and he entered the Foreign
Service. Both his elder brothers were killed on active duty.

 &HT;    Texas officials set out to stop 800 percent interest payday
loans
 &HT;    By Earl Golz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Cash-strapped Texans are paying rates as high as
800 percent on an annual basis for loans to tie them over from one
payday to another, the Southwest Regional Office of the Consumers
Union said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called payday lenders disguise their transactions _ and
avoid conflicts with state law _ by claiming they charge ``fees,''
not interest rates which are subject Texas' usury laws. The fees
can, over time, amount to an interest rate of several hundred
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumers Union and American Association of Retired Persons
have asked two Texas agencies _ the Consumer Credit Commission and
Attorney General's Office _ to step up enforcement to stop the
growing problem of payday lending.
</P>
<P>
   Payday lending has had ``substantial growth'' in the last 12 to
24 months in Texas, said Consumer Credit Commissioner Leslie
Pettijohn.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John Cornyn is ``very interested in protecting
Texas consumers and halting this practice'' of payday loans, said
spokeswoman Andrea Horton.
</P>
<P>
   Payday lenders require a personal check that serves as
collateral for a loan, said Rob Schneider, an attorney for
Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a borrower cannot repay or renew the loan at the end of the
loan period, typically 14 days, the lender cashes or threatens to
cash the check,'' Schneider said. ``One business told Consumers
Union, 'If you don't repay us, we will cash your check. If your
check bounces then we will file for a hot check.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the payday lending practice, borrowers with insufficient
funds to cover the check risk criminal theft-by-check charges if
they cannot keep up with the steep renewal payments. Payday lenders
thus enlist justices of the peace to act, in effect, as their
collection agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumers Union has asked the Texas Legislature to make it
illegal for lenders to pursue or threaten to pursue hot check
collection against borrowers on payday loans. Bills calling for
such a ban have been introduced in the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unconscionable that these lenders use the criminal hot
check collection system to enforce these high-cost loans,'' said
Wilhelmina Gladden, chair of the AARP's Texas Legislative
Committee. ``The threat of criminal hot check prosecution is a
powerful tool lenders use to get people to renew these loans that
should not have been made in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Consumers Union surveyed 27 payday lenders in Texas,
including 12 in the Austin area, and found several payday loan
variations. A large number called themselves ``sales-leaseback''
companies that claim to buy home appliances from their customers
and lease them back for a ``rental fee.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies all advance money for an initial period of less
than one month, taking a personal check as collateral. They
typically charge $33 per $100 borrowed every 14 days. Borrowers may
renew this advance over and over, quickly repaying the lender in
fees more than was borrowed. The fee is the equivalent of nearly
800 in annual percentage rate interest, Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   One company included in the survey disputed the results.
</P>
<P>
   Cash Plus, a sales leaseback company in Austin that was included
in the survey, denied it loaned as much as the $270 maximum per
loan amount listed by Consumers Union. Cash Plus manager Patricia
Mings also said the $33 fee listed per $100 borrowed also was not
accurate. She said she could not disclose the amount for
competitive reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very customer-oriented,'' she said. ``We are probably
one of the few that gives the customer something back for the fee.
They get something in return from us for our fees, which are lower
than all the competitors to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas' Constitution bans usury or exorbitant rates for loans.
Still, signature lenders may charge more than 90 percent on an
annual percentage rate, including $4 per month per $100 borrowed
and an up-front fee of $10 to cover processing costs. Signature
lenders in Texas make more than 3.5 million loans for $1 billion
annually, according to Pettijohn.

PALESTINIANS REJECT NETANYAHU OFFER AS A CAMPAIGN TACTIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently made a
quiet offer to the Palestinians to carry out a couple of Israel's
obligations under the frozen peace agreement signed last fall, but
the offer was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Through an Israeli intermediary, Netanyahu proposed that Israel
open up the promised southern safe-passage route between the
Palestinian territories in the West Bank and Gaza, officials say.
And he volunteered to release some Palestinian petty criminals from
Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
   But he made no offer to cede any additional territory in the
West Bank. For that reason, the Palestinians did not take the
initiative seriously, seeing it as a domestic political gesture on
Netanyahu's part.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't accept partial measures,'' said Saeb Erekat, a senior
Palestinian peace negotiator. ``And we won't be brought into the
Israeli elections. We urge him: `Please, leave us alone. We don't
want to be dragged into your campaign, for you or against you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's effort to reopen a conversation with the
Palestinians points up once more the clear-cut connection between
the peace effort and domestic Israeli politics.
</P>
<P>
   Since Netanyahu's government collapsed in December, the
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, negotiated at the Wye
Plantation in Maryland last October, has been shelved in
anticipation of the outcome of Israeli elections in late May.
Contacts between high-level Israeli and Palestinian officials have
ceased.
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu must walk a political tightrope. To keep his
right-wing support and win back some of the far right, he must
stand tough on his position: Israel cannot comply with the peace
agreement because the Palestinians have failed to take the promised
steps to fight terrorism. But to cut into the broad yet elusive
center, he would gain by showing a good-faith effort to proceed on
the path to peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the initiative had succeeded, it would have allowed
Netanyahu to project both images simultaneously, since there would
have been no substantial territorial concession made,'' said David
Makovsky, the diplomatic correspondent for the newspaper Haaretz.
</P>
<P>
   David Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's communications adviser, said
Netanyahu's initiative was not motivated by politics. ``They are
interested only in withdrawal,'' he said of the Palestinians.
``They're not interested in letting us look like we're with it,
like we have momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Israel was supposed to have turned over 13
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians by the end of January,
bringing to 40 percent the area under Palestinian control. In turn,
the Palestinians were supposed to have cracked down on what the
Israelis call ``the terrorist infrastructure.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Wye agreement has been a political football since it was
signed, well before the volatile election campaign got under way.
And Netanyahu's handling of this ball has worsened tensions with
the Americans, who privately and not so privately accuse the
Israelis of antagonizing the Palestinians in a way that could
backfire on them.
</P>
<P>
   At a forum in Washington this week, Martin S. Indyk, the
assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, offered an
unusually public expression of the Clinton administration's
frustration with the Israeli approach.
</P>
<P>
   Indyk, a former ambassador to Israel, politely upbraided an
Israeli diplomat for what he said was misleading the audience about
the Palestinians' supposed release from prison of ``known
terrorists and murderers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not true,'' Indyk said at the forum of the Jewish
Council for Public Affairs on Monday. ``They did release people. We
checked on it. We checked your information, we checked their
information, we had our own information. And it is simply not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not release terrorists and murderers.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Israeli diplomat, Lenny Ben-David, backtracked,
saying that those released had conspired in terrorist killings,
even if they did not directly carry them out. But he distanced
himself from the position of his Israeli colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of you have seen releases from the Israeli government
that accused the Palestinians of releasing killers of Americans,''
Ben-David said. ``That is a statement I will not make.''
</P>
<P>
   At the forum, Indyk cautioned the Israelis to be careful in
making allegations about the Palestinians' supposed missteps. And
he suggested that the Israelis use basic psychology in their
dealings with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the best way to get them to improve their behavior?''
he said. ``Is it to beat on them all the time? Or is it to
encourage them? Or is it to build their confidence in your
relationship with them?''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's recent offer was made in the last week or two,
apparently by his lawyer, Yitzhak Molcho, who has served as a
liaison with the Palestinians. It struck some here as incongruous
with Netanyahu's public posture, and his repeated insistence that
the Israelis would do nothing until the Palestinians complied with
a host of demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find this action totally incomprehensible,'' said Erekat,
the Palestinian negotiator. ``Every day, every week, he sends out
faxes to CNN, to Reuters, to The New York Times, saying we violated
this, we violated that. He is always putting us on the defensive.
And, out of nowhere, he offers us one piece of candy? So that he
can prove to the center that, what, he's a man of peace?''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiated with President Clinton's direct participation, the
Wye accord was supposed to have broken an 18-month impasse between
the Israelis and the Palestinians. But from the beginning the
Israelis and the Palestinians read the somewhat ambiguous text
differently.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to American Jewish organizations in Jerusalem last
week, Netanyahu said the land-for-security peace plan was
structured as a ``sequential'' agreement, in which the Israelis
would act only after the Palestinians had complied with their
obligations under each phase.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement itself speaks of a ``parallel, phased
approach,'' and both the Americans and the Palestinians take that
to mean that both sides are to act in tandem.

SENATORS' `CALL FOR RECONCILIATION' GOES LARGELY UNANSWERED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., Conn., Mo., Pa., Conn., Hawaii., Va., Okla., Alaska,
Ala.)  (mk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As signs go, it was not a good one.
</P>
<P>
   Striving to bury the biliousness of impeachment, Sens. Sam
Brownback, R-Kan., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., issued press
releases early this week announcing a bipartisan ``call for
reconciliation.'' All senators were invited to ``pull together and
face the future with a collaborative spirit,'' as Lieberman put it.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday morning, in a meeting room bulging with gospel
singers, ministers, a rabbi and a priest, who all intoned about
tolerance, mercy and forgiveness, it was not at all evident that
``the call'' had been heard. There, at the very front of the room,
sat the attending senators, all six of them _ three Republicans and
three Democrats, though a flash sighting of Sen. John Ashcroft,
R-Mo., at the back of the room would bring the count to seven.
</P>
<P>
   Why the low turnout? Could it be, after all is said and done,
that the Senate is not so different from the House, where a
scheduled retreat on civility and congeniality in Hershey, Pa., has
prompted an onslaught of snickers instead of kisses, and threats of
a boycott?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God, no,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. ``It's so
acrimonious there,'' in the House, he added. ``It's so sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning's poor attendance was disappointing, senators
said. Those who showed up were the Democratic Sens. Daniel Akaka of
Hawaii, Charles Robb of Virginia and Dodd, and the Republicans
Sens. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Ted Stevens of Alaska, Jeff
Sessions of Alabama and Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
   But the meager showing was not a bad sign, many of them said: It
simply demonstrated how much progress members had already made in
reconciling their own differences over impeachment. With all 100 of
them thrust together on the Senate floor day after day, senators
bonded during the ordeal. The House, on the other hand, came
unglued, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This very divisive, troubling episode actually united us, as
men and women, as individuals who happen to be senators,''
Lieberman, who is co-chairman with Brownback of the Center for
Jewish and Christian Values, said Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The trial had ``its own salutory benefits,'' Dodd agreed. ``So
it may be that many members felt they had already, in a sense, gone
through a reconciliation with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the image of acrimony that the House is trying to buff
clean with its annual retreat on civility. This year, though, the
retreat has prompted even more eye-rolling than usual. Democrats
are not at all keen on the idea, calling it superficial. And some
Republicans aren't too enthused themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The House minority leader, Richard Gephardt, said Friday that he
had encouraged Democrats to attend ``this thing in Hershey,'' but
he cautioned, ``you only make progress slowly and incrementally.''
</P>
<P>
   Reconciliation between President Clinton and Republicans in
Congress may be no less tricky. Brownback, for one, who voted to
convict Clinton and called for his resignation last year, has
invoked a lot of prayers to try to make that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had harbored a lot of ill will and dislike and, really,
hatred for the president,'' Brownback said after the meeting. ``I
have been praying for him and that has gone. I have forgiven him
and I hope he forgives me.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in the same breath, Brownback and other Republicans warned
that forgiveness and comity have little to do with policy and
legislating. Brownback will turn the other cheek, not give up his
backbone, he said, especially over abortion, tax cuts and
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure to separate out the difference between
reconciliation and genuine policy issues,'' he told reporters. ``I
will confront you on policy issues, and I will love you
personally.''

UNION WINS RIGHT TO REPRESENT 74,000 LOS ANGELES HEALTH-CARE
WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Winning the biggest unionization drive in more
than half a century, the Service Employees International Union
gained the right on Thursday to represent 74,000 Los Angeles County
home-care workers who feed, bathe and clean for the elderly and
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The organizing drive _ more than twice as large as any other
drive in decades _ demonstrates the labor movement's newfound
aggressiveness, its new focus on recruiting workers in large clumps
and in recruiting low-wage workers, women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County's home-care workers earn $5.75 an hour, and
many said they voted to join the union because they want it to
fight to raise their wages and to obtain two benefits long denied
them _ health insurance and paid vacations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something big for us,'' said Maria Alvarez, who
complained that after 14 years on the job she still earns just
$5.75 an hour, the minimum wage in California. ``I'm so happy about
the union, I feel like flying. They'll help us win benefits, like
health insurance and vacations. Right now, we don't have nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials who counted the ballots, which were mailed in
over the past month, estimated on Thursday that about 90 percent of
the 20,000 workers who cast ballots voted for the union. As a
result, the Service Employees Union will represent the county's
74,000 home-care providers, making the drive labor's biggest
organizing victory since 1941 when 75,000 workers at what was then
the nation's largest factory _ the Ford Motor Co.'s River Rouge
plant _ voted to join the United Auto Workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a home run for labor amidst the sea of a lot of
strikeouts, in that it is huge victory in a pivotal sector of the
economy, the service sector,'' said Harley Shaiken, a labor
specialist at the University of California, Berkeley. ``And it
represents the new face of labor _ women workers, minority workers,
low-paid workers, people who have often been so hard to organize.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles officials said on Thursday that unionization, by
improving wages and benefits, would create a more stable, better
trained workforce allowing the elderly and disabled to receive
improved home care. Zev Yaroslavsky, a member of the Los Angeles
County Board of Supervisors, even predicted that the better trained
supply of home-care workers brought about through unionization
might discourage many elderly people from moving into nursing
homes, persuading them instead to remain at home and receive
home-care assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are expected to begin in the next few weeks between
the union and the county authority that supervises home care.
</P>
<P>
   The organizing drive highlights the shift in the economy and in
labor's focus away from manufacturing and toward the service
sector, especially toward health care, an area in which only one
million of the nation's 12 million health-care workers are
unionized.
</P>
<P>
   In wooing the home-care workers, the Service Employees Union,
the nation's fastest-growing union, underlined labor's effort to
organize low-wage workers, who are seen as fertile ground for
labor's message. With this strategy, the labor movement hopes to
transform itself into a high-minded movement, like the civil rights
movement, that focuses in large part on those on the bottom rungs _
a sharp departure from past decades when labor was viewed as
preoccupied with representing pampered, high-paid auto and steel
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign represents a new direction for the labor
movement,'' said David Rolf, 29, who worked more than 14 hours a
day for the past year spearheading the organizing drive. ``It is a
campaign where we reached out to low-income, women workers, workers
of color and immigrant workers. If you look at the demographic
changes in Southern California, the labor movement has to figure
out how to bring these workers in because they are the backbone of
the new, low-wage service-sector economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Spearheading the drive, 40 young organizers went to apartment
houses, churches and bus stops to urge home-care aides to support
the union. All told, they visited 33,000 workers at home. But the
unionization campaign was unusual not only in its size, but also in
its length. It took more than 11 years and required the Service
Employees Union to persuade the California Legislature to enact a
statute enabling these workers to unionize.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the organizing drive began in 1987, state courts
ruled that home-care aides were independent contractors without the
right to unionize. Although their salaries were paid by a
combination of federal, state and county funds, the courts ruled
that neither the state nor the county was the employer for these
workers. Instead, the courts said the individual clients were the
employers, making the workers and union recognize that if they were
to negotiate better wages and benefits, they would need to bargain
with large entities.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``A decade ago people thought we were crazy to try to organize
California's 180,000 home-care workers once the courts said they
were independent contractors,'' said Andrew Stern, president of the
Service Employees International Union. ``We said, `if we can't
organize the fastest growing occupation in America, then what does
that say about the labor movement?'''
</P>
<P>
   Eager to help _ and sign up _ these low-paid workers, the
Service Employees persuaded the Legislature to pass a law in 1992
that authorized counties to create authorities that would
administer the home-care programs and serve as the workers'
employers. In 1997, Los Angeles County set up such an authority, a
consumer-dominated body called the Personal Assistance Services
Council.
</P>
<P>
   This enabled the union to organize 6,100 home-care workers in
Alameda County in 1994, 5,500 in San Francisco County in 1996 and
4,000 in Contra Costa County in 1997. In 1997, Los Angeles County
set up an authority to administer its own authority, a
consumer-dominated body called the Personal Assistance Services
Council.
</P>
<P>
   In California, county officials interview the elderly and
disabled to determine whether they qualify for government-paid home
care. Government officials prefer providing the elderly with
home-care aides to sending them to nursing homes because nursing
homes are far more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The unionization vote covered the 74,000 workers who participate
in a program for low-income elderly and disabled persons. The more
than 10,000 home-care providers in Los Angeles County working for
private agencies were not covered by the unionization vote.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders assert that unionizing these home-care aides will
help worker and client alike. Many elderly and disabled clients
grow alarmed when their aides quit for higher-paying jobs, and
raising their wages is expected to reduce the 40 percent annual
turnover of these workers. In addition, the union and county
authority are expected to provide some training for the workers.
Several workers interviewed said they have received no training.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Alvarez, the home-care worker, said she was pleased that the
union would help provide training for handling clients who are
extremely heavy and who have Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   One of her clients, Mercedes Dacosta, an 85-year-old widow with
serious knee problems, said it would be a disaster for her if Ms.
Alvarez left her after six years for a higher-paying job.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Who are all these 43.4 million Americans, at the
Census Bureau's last count, who do not have health insurance? Who
runs the least risk in going without it? (Children.) Who runs the
most risk? (Sick people approaching 65.) Who is most likely to have
it? (People over 65.) Not to have it? (Adults who work for low
wages.) Who doesn't care? (Invincible youth.)
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, a average of a million Americans a year
have either lost their health insurance or failed to obtain
insurance for which they became eligible. The reasons vary:
prohibitive premiums, reduced employer coverage, the welfare
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the causes, the increase in the number of uninsured
is a startling anomaly in an economy that has been able to subdue
inflation, unemployment and budget deficits. Much to the dismay of
advocates for the uninsured, the United States, despite its bounty,
stands almost alone among industrial nations in not providing free
basic health care for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number is going in absolutely the wrong direction,'' said
Grace-Marie Arnett, president of the conservative Galen Institute,
a health and tax policy organization. ``It shows something is wrong
with the system.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the rise in the cost of insurance and health care
outrunning wages gains, said Paul Fronstin, an analyst at the
nonpartisan Employee Benefit Research Institute, ``this is going to
get worse unless something is done about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The what to do about it _ long primarily the concern of liberals
_ is now being weighed by politicians across the political
spectrum. The still-evolving proposals range from expanding
government insurance programs to tax breaks helping more people buy
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general,'' said Judith Feder, dean of policy studies at the
Georgetown University Public Policy Institute, ``there is
acknowledgment across ideological and partisan lines that the
reason people don't have coverage is they can't afford it and that
the way to provide it is through subsidies. Then the question is
how the subsidies are to be given and whether to focus on
particular populations.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is debate on how to help them, few experts disagree
on who they are.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, not many are elderly or seriously disabled
because Medicare covers most of them.
</P>
<P>
   Another group, some five million to six million have family
incomes exceeding $75,000 a year and can usually afford the
insurance that they forgo for a number of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 11 million are children, from indigent to well off. But
to many health system analysts, children raise less-compelling
concerns than large numbers of the other uninsured. First, they are
generally healthier than adults and cheaper to treat.
</P>
<P>
   And second, alone among the uninsured, they have already been
singled out for help, under a $24 billion, five-year program for
non-Medicaid eligible children that was approved by Congress in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the rest of the uninsured, those who need coverage
most: 25 million to 30 million people who have the greatest chance
of becoming ill and who cannot pay for care when they do.
Demographically, they run the gamut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some work, and some don't,'' said Katherine Swartz, an
associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. ``Some
don't work because they're sick. Some are very young adults not
covered by their parents' health insurance. They take jobs serving
latte in coffee shops that are not likely to have health insurance.
They just don't think about the risks.''
</P>
<P>
   The income of some is so low that they cannot afford to buy
insurance, Ms. Swartz said, but not so low that they qualify for
Medicaid. Others may qualify but fail to apply, because of
ignorance, language barriers or a general sense of intimidation. So
they rely on emergency rooms for all their care.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the uninsured in the greatest need of coverage ``are
working adults who are not quite in the middle class,'' said David
B. Kendall, health policy analyst at the Progressive Policy
Institute. ``They are the folks who don't have a job that's going
to be there for a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Minority groups account for a disproportionate number of the
uninsured, Kendall said. Among Hispanic Americans, nearly half of
those under 65 are uninsured; the Hispanic category makes up only
11 percent of the population but 21 percent of all the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say there are several reasons, some of which reflect a
conscious choice to forgo insurance: Hispanic people who have
immigrated to the United States tend to be healthy and to value
self-reliance. They may also be intimidated by language and
cultural barriers from applying for Medicaid and other assistance.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The travails of the uninsured are often dismissed because the
law assures them the last-resort, safety-net care of emergency
rooms, says Drew E. Altman, president of the Kaiser Family
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time they call the ambulance, many have gone without
the preventive care that might have averted the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of adults under 65 by Kaiser and the Commonwealth Fund
found that in a single year, 24 percent of the uninsured declined
to fill a prescription that had been given to them by a doctor,
compared with 6 percent of those who had insurance. Fifty-one
percent had difficulty obtaining care compared with 10 percent of
the insured, and 42 percent never saw a doctor during the prior
year, compared with 17 percent for the insured.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the uninsured are sicker than others, according to
a study last year by the Center for Studying Health System Change,
a research group supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
The study found that 16.3 percent of uninsured people under 65 were
in fair to poor health, compared with 10.6 percent of all people
under 65.
</P>
<P>
   ``The uninsured use less care,'' said John Holahan, health
policy analyst at the Urban Institute. ``When they do get care,
they get less of it.''
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for the rise in the uninsured is the shift of
people from welfare to work. More than six million have left the
welfare rolls in the last five years, many for low-wage jobs that
do not offer any insurance or that charge a lot for it.
</P>
<P>
   For these workers, there is help for a while from Medicaid, the
federal-state insurance program for the poor, which is
automatically granted welfare recipients. In most states, families
can remain on Medicaid for a year after leaving the cash-assistance
rolls.
</P>
<P>
   But then, said Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families
USA, a consumer advocacy group, ``their reward is the loss of
health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the swelling in the number is the rising cost
of health care _ for hospital stays, physician visits and
prescription medicine. It is climbing faster than workers' wages,
and on top of the general increase in the cost of care, employers
are asking workers to a larger share of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, nearly two-thirds of all businesses with 100 or more
workers paid the full cost of an individual worker's care, a Kaiser
Family Foundation study says. A decade later only a third did so.
Kaiser says employers that ask workers to pay part of the cost
through payroll deductions raised the workers' share from 13
percent in 1988 to 22 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a survey by the federal Agency for Health Care
Policy and Research found, one in four workers who were offered
employer-subsidized insurance in 1997 declined to sign up. A decade
ago, only one in ten declined.
</P>
<P>
   These changes, analysts say, have spawned the largest segment of
the uninsured, the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   In a study this month of the uninsured in 1997, the Center for
Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group in
Washington, reported that nearly half the nation's 4.5 million
working parents with incomes below the federal poverty line _
$13,650 for a family of three _ were uninsured. And of the 15.8
million who made up to twice the poverty wage, or $27,300 for
three, it said a third were uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Young adults, some poor, some not, represent another large group
of the uninsured. Of 65 million people up to 34 years old, nearly
25 percent are uninsured, compared with 13 percent of the rest of
the population, and they represent nearly 40 percent of all the
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Of the youngest among them, those 19 to 24, the Center for
Studying Health System Change says 30 percent are not offered
insurance through their jobs. Of those who are offered it,
typically for a few hundred dollars a year, 30 percent turn it
down.
</P>
<P>
   Some who reject it are working poor and cannot afford it.
Others, feeling immortal, use their wages for something else. But
in forgoing regular care, the youngest appear to pay a toll as they
age. The center reports that nearly 18 percent of the uninsured
aged 25 to 34 are in fair to poor health, compared with 10 percent
for all people their age.
</P>
<P>
   However much some young adults feel they can do without
insurance, the nation has an incentive to help them buy it,
analysts say. Like safe drivers who never have accidents and still
buy car insurance, young adults' health insurance premiums help
defray the cost of care for people who are frailer and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we need these people for cross-subsidies?'' asked Fronstin
of the Employee Benefit Research Institute. ``Or should we wait
until they get sick or have an accident?
</P>
<P>
   While many analysts may have arrived at an answer, he said,
Congress has not.
</P>
<P>
   Among the beneficiaries of cross-subsidies would be a less
obviously needy group of the uninsured: the poorer and sicker,
often retired and homebound, among the 23 million Americans aged 55
to 64 who are not yet eligible for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center for Studying Health System Change,
people in that age group have average family incomes of $45,800,
about $4,000 more than the average for all families and enough to
permit nearly 90 percent of them to pay the age group's high
premiums of close to $3,000 a year, even if the employer pays no
share.
</P>
<P>
   But the 3 million among them who are uninsured earn an average
of only $18,000. The center reports that one third of them are in
particularly perilous straits. These 1 million are in ill health
and have average incomes of just $9,600, which puts private
coverage far out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   This year, President Clinton has revived a proposal he made last
year to allow people aged 55 to 64 the option of joining Medicare
by paying $300 to $400 a month until they are 65. But at $400 a
month, the one third in peril would be spending half their incomes
for health insurance.

MORE DETAILS ON HOLBROOKE EMERGE AS SENATORS REVIEW FILES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While still at the State Department, Richard
Holbrooke, President Clinton's nominee for chief delegate to the
United Nations, opened job negotiations with a large investment
bank only a few months after intervening to help the bank win a
multimillion-dollar consulting contract in Hungary, according to a
State Department report.
</P>
<P>
   Department investigators found no evidence, however, that
Holbrooke was offered a job by the bank, Credit Suisse First
Boston, as a result of the intervention with the American
ambassador to Hungary in 1995. The investigators also found no
evidence that he saw the firm as a potential employer at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the details of that incident and others involving Credit
Suisse are now being closely studied by the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, which is weighing Holbrooke's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   While congressional officials from both parties agree that
Holbrooke is almost certain to be confirmed by the Senate, the
committee's Republican leadership has vowed to investigate a
variety of conflict-of-interest allegations made against the
veteran diplomat, who was the architect of the 1995 agreement that
ended the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say they want to know whether he was treated too
leniently by the State Department and the Justice Department during
ethics investigations that delayed his nomination by eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Justice Department prosecutors dropped their
investigation after Holbrooke agreed to pay $5,000 to the
government to settle civil charges that he had violated federal
lobbying laws in contacts with the U.S. Embassy in South Korea
after leaving the State Department in 1996 to join Credit Suisse.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has denied any wrongdoing and has insisted that he
agreed to the settlement only to end the ethics investigation and
to allow his nomination to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   He referred questions Thursday to his lawyer, Richard I.
Beattie, who said that the investigators seemed insensitive to the
predicament created for Holbrooke when, while working at Credit
Suisse, he was named a senior foreign-policy adviser to the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole business suggests to me that under the current
rules, it's almost impossible to try to help the government if
you're in the business sector,'' Beattie said.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the State Department's inspector general, obtained
under a Federal Freedom of Information Act request, identified a
series of incidents that could raise questions about possible
violations of federal lobbying laws. The laws bar former senior
government officials from lobbying their former colleagues for a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that on six occasions within a year after
leaving the State Department, Holbrooke was reimbursed by Credit
Suisse for dinners and luncheons he bought for senior department
officials, even though Holbrooke and his guests insisted that
Credit Suisse business was never discussed at the meals.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department investigators also determined that during
that year, Holbrooke made three trips _ to the Czech Republic,
Sweden and South Korea _ on behalf of Credit Suisse in which he
requested that American ambassadors take some kind of official
action, usually by helping him arrange appointments in foreign
capitals.
</P>
<P>
   The report was referred to the Justice Department for possible
prosecution. Prosecutors there found only one incident _ the one
involving the U.S. ambassador in South Korea _ in which there was
sufficient evidence to seek civil charges.
</P>
<P>
   But members of the Foreign Relations Committee are expected to
use all the incidents in the report as a road map in determining
whether Holbrooke created at least the appearance of a conflict of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the State Department, Holbrooke served as an
unpaid envoy to the Balkans and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Holbrooke's, and even some of his adversaries, say
that the charges made against him are unfair, and that it would
have been impossible for him to separate completely his work as an
investment banker and as an envoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigators totally ignored the fact that Holbrooke wore
two hats during this period,'' said Beattie. ``He was an investment
banker, but he was also an unpaid but official consultant to the
State Department and the president.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Holbrooke inadvertently billed the meals with State
Department officials to Credit Suisse, and that he had recently
reimbursed the firm.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of Holbrooke began last summer with an
anonymous letter involving Holbrooke's intervention in a Credit
Suisse campaign to win a consulting contract on privatization with
the government of Hungary.

DISNEY GIVES NEW JOBS TO 2 OF ITS TOP MANAGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In key management reshufflings Thursday, Walt Disney Co. named
Robert Iger to the new post of president of Walt Disney
International and also made him chairman of ABC Group.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Bornstein, the former chairman of ESPN and president of
ABC Sports, replaces Iger as president of ABC. Though Bornstein
will report to Iger, some longtime Disney experts saw the
appointment as a graceful way to remove Iger from direct day-to-day
responsibilities at ABC, which continues to face ratings problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The network has continued to perform poorly, and there is a
troubling trend in the decline in viewers 18 to 49, a key Disney
demographic,'' said Ed Hatch, who follows Disney for Cowen &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a telephone interview Thursday, Michael Eisner,
Disney's chairman, went to great lengths to say that the move was a
promotion for Iger, emphasizing how important it was for Disney to
systematically strengthen and integrate its businesses overseas.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed any notion that Iger was being pushed aside, saying
the appointment ``was definitely a promotion.'' He also insisted it
was ``not anything else,'' alluding to investors' desire to see him
name a second in command. Eisner cited a list of recent
appointments to support his effort to bolster top management.
</P>
<P>
   But one executive who has long followed the company said
privately that Disney might have wanted to give Bornstein a larger
role in programming because he had done an impressive job at ESPN.
This person said the appointment had a second benefit for Eisner,
who had heart surgery several years ago and is not an enthusiastic
traveler. By appointing Iger to the new position, Eisner can
somewhat reduce his own need to travel.
</P>
<P>
   Iger, 48, has been president of ABC since 1996 and had risen to
chief operating officer of Capital Cities/ABC before Disney bought
the company in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bornstein started at ESPN in 1980 and rose to increasingly
responsible positions within the network's programming and
production divisions. Three years ago, he also became president of
ABC Sports. Eisner said, ``Bornstein grew up in charge of
entertainment programming.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Iger's new job, Eisner said Thursday that one of the
company's important areas of growth was overseas. ``We have to act
more like a multinational company,'' Eisner said. Around the world,
``McDonald's has one brand,'' he said, ``3M has many brands. We are
right in between. We are one brand _ the Disney brand _ and then we
have many properties inside the brands.''
</P>
<P>
   Iger's task will be to bring the same kind of corporate focus
overseas that Disney has domestically. ``I am the country manager
for the U.S.,'' said Eisner, who added that he met with executives
every week to discuss matters like the Go Network, the company's
Internet portal, and the integration of other properties.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company needed to integrate its efforts better
overseas. ``Take Japan,'' Eisner said. ``It is our biggest market
outside the U.S. and Canada. However, we have not been able to make
our animated movies work there like everywhere else. We have Disney
stores in Japan. If we had somebody living there, just working in
Japan, they could get our video releases more strongly in our
stores and help the parks cross-promote our animated stores. We
want someone to protect and grow the Disney brand and do
appropriate things with it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   David Londoner, who follows Disney for Schroder Inc., said that
Disney, which now gets about 20 percent of its revenue overseas,
could benefit from improved performance overseas. The revenue
percentage has dropped since Disney bought ABC, which is primarily
a domestic business.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really trying to focus on foreign, where it is likely
the major growth is going to happen in the next five years, and
they want to have a high-visibility executive running those
operations,'' Londoner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about it, 4 to 5 percent of the world's kids, who
represent about 20 percent of the world's income, are here,'' he
added. ``But Disney still gets maybe 80 percent of its income here,
so there is room for growth abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Iger will be traveling far more than he had previously
and thus will be farther away from ABC's day-to-day operations,
even though Bornstein will report to him. As Eisner described the
new job, Disney will appoint an executive in several important
territories to help integrate operations.

HALBERSTAM HAMMERS THE HYPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Pulitzer Prize-winning author David Halberstam
wrote a book on the sports communication empires, it would be on
Disney, News Corp and Time Warner, which own ESPN, Fox and CNN. He
could call it ``The Powers That Beat It Over Our Heads 24 Hours A
Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam, best known for his literary works on the Vietnam War
and the Civil Rights movement, won't give a very glowing report on
today's sports media based on his experience writing two
NBA-related books nearly 20 years apart.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1979-80 season, Halberstam hung out with the Portland
Trail Blazers for his first sports-based book, ``The Breaks of the
Game.'' His latest book, ``Playing For Keeps: Michael Jordan and
the World He Made'' (Random House) hit the shelves not long after
Jordan's retirement was official.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Halberstam discovered something interesting
about the process. As imposing as it may have seemed working within
the budding TV-driven sports media in the late '70s, it was nothing
like the late '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger? Yes. But better?
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam, whose most recognized work may be his dissection of
the New York Times' clout in ``The Powers That Be,'' ran into a a
drastically changed process of information gathering and reporting
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Which might not be news to us, but it was a sports culture shock
for Halberstam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quantum jump we didn't know about back then was cable,''
Halberstam said during a stop in Los Angeles earlier this week.
``When TV came along in the late '50s, the first beneficiary was
football. It captured the violence and ferocity that radio
couldn't. But football was one game a week. As cable got bigger and
the cameras and technology got better, it could capture the
artistry of basketball live four nights a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This rare confluence of satellite technology and corporate
commercial drive and the individual artistry of a Michael Jordan
came together. Michael would never be anything in the radio age. It
would be like describing ballet on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly didn't realize how powerful cable could be. Nor
did the people at ESPN, I'm sure. To borrow a phrase from Faulkner,
it was as if no one knew the world was round.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years ago, Halberstam had almost unlimited access to
players like Bill Walton and his Blazers teammates, as did all
newspaper beat reporters. TV was a key media component, but
remember, the NBA Finals were still televised on tape-delay at
11:30 p.m. because CBS feared the ratings during sweeps would
plunder. It was also a time when CBS cut straight to a golf
tournament after the Blazers' 1977 Finals win because that sport
was more important to corporate suits.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam found that the one media element that remained _ TV
hype _ has not been much of a benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing I remember well was the beginning of NBA hype
of the networks,'' said Halberstam. ``It'd be Brent Musburger
shouting `It's the Bird man against the Magic man!' . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``But 20 years later, it's still all about hype, individuals and
stardom rather than teams. Is it a good thing? Some players can
handle it. Michael knew how to. Shawn Kemp thinks it's all about
being on ESPN `SportsCenter' dunking, what gets the clips on.
That's not an undivided plus.''
</P>
<P>
   For today's print journalists, covering an NBA team means seeing
coaches fired live on cable TV. They have to come up with new,
deeper stories. It means also elbowing for room with those who put
the pictures on the air.
</P>
<P>
   In his author's note in ``Playing for Keeps,'' Halberstam said
he spent a season following the Chicago Bulls and never asked a
question in the locker room, calling that ``perhaps a journalistic
first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's more access (to players today) but really
less,'' Halberstam said. ``They open the locker room after a game
and instead of five or six beat reporters who are doing their job,
it's for 200 more people, no one knows who they are, sticking
microphones in front of anyone, and asking blow-away questions.
There's obviously less trust and less substance coming out, and
it's easier for players to dismiss the media.

   ``There's less accountability on the part of the players today
and that showed during the lockout . . . there was no connection to
how the rest of the world saw what they were doing. As you get more
cut off, you get guys without much connection, much more print
journalism with attitude, much more stinging.
</P>
<P>
   ``It heightens the lines drawn between players and reporters.
There's a lot to be said on both sides about accountability.''

   The celebrity-driven media surrounding Jordan that Halberstam
notes in ``Playing For Keeps'' often keeps the superstars from
revealing anything about their personal lives to even their
teammates, since reporters end up probing them for the information.
It's a symptom that Halberstam wishes would disappear, but has no
reason to believe it will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society would be well served if we all knew less about the
private lives of celebrities,'' said Halberstam, who got a taste of
being the target of media scorn when, as a young Vietnam reporter
in the early '60s, he was accused of being a Communist sympathizer
because of what he revealed about the U.S.'s participation in the
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the country would be better served without Monica
Lewinsky, Ken Starr, the President's wretched, reckless personal
life and the private lives of many celebrities that really aren't
that interesting. Society used to erect something of a firewall.
That's come down in this new media age. I'd like to (put it up
again), but that's gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in an entertainment world and all the tabloid shows
have infiltrated the networks and increasing popular culture has a
foothold in serious journalism. We pry at a level we don't have a
right to.'' &QL;

<P>
   A self-employed publicist, Shari L. Goldstein began building her
business in the spring of 1996, when the older of her two sons
turned 6. ``I started in a corner nook in my former husband's law
office,'' Ms. Goldstein said. ``But it's a busy place, so I
eventually rented a small office in Huntington,'' N.Y., near her
home in Jericho on Long Island. ``Through word of mouth, the
business developed.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Ms. Goldstein, 40, like a growing number of entrepreneurs
and consultants, moved her office to her home, giving herself the
full array of tax traps and opportunities faced by the
self-employed.
</P>
<P>
   The move occurred last September, when she and her husband were
negotiating an amicable divorce; they agreed that he would get the
law practice and she would get their home.
</P>
<P>
   She moved the business into the home office for both personal
and financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids were starting more after-school programs, and I knew
that I'd have to do a lot more running around,'' she said.
``Working at home gives me more flexibility and more time,'' she
said, although she still works more than 40 hours a week. In
addition, the move saved money by eliminating rental payments and
created tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other start-up businesses, Ms. Goldstein's has
always turned at least a small annual profit. So she never had to
deal with an Internal Revenue Service policy, called the ``hobby
loss'' rule, that generally prevents people from deducting expenses
in a business that is unprofitable for 3 out of 5 years. The IRS
often construes small money-losing businesses as hobbies, not
commercial ventures.
</P>
<P>
   A talkative, outgoing woman, Ms. Goldstein worked in advertising
and public relations before having children. She had enjoyed the
publicity business but wanted to strike out on her own.
</P>
<P>
   Like many business owners, she outfitted her office with a
computer, a printer, a fax machine and two phone lines. Under
Section 179 of the tax code, she was able to deduct the entire cost
of the equipment in 1997, the year she bought it _ rather than
depreciate it and take the deductions over several years. (For 1998
returns, business equipment worth up to $18,500 can be deducted in
the year it was bought.)
</P>
<P>
   But she missed out on another tax break for self-employed people
by not setting up a Keogh tax-deferred retirement plan for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business was just starting out, and there wasn't much
money around,'' she said. Besides, she said, she was married at the
time, and ``I didn't think that it was necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldstein, whose clients are professionals, authors and
companies, including Arthur Murray International Inc. and Chiron
Associates, reported her business income and expenses on Schedule C
of the joint tax return she filed with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   The couple plan to file their final joint tax return in April.
After that, Ms. Goldstein will file her own return.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in a significantly higher tax bracket,'' she said. They
are ``paying taxes at a rate of 40 percent, which kills me,'' she
said. ``I'm looking forward to stopping that.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the divorce settlement, her former husband will pay
her health insurance premiums until her alimony ends in the summer
of 2000. At that point, as a self-employed entrepreneur, she will
be able to deduct 60 percent of her premiums; by 2003, they will be
fully deductible.
</P>
<P>
   She expects her business, which she runs as a sole
proprietorship, to earn $50,000 this year. Has she thought about
incorporating the business? ``The amount that I would pay to
incorporate would negate the tax benefits,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She figures that incorporating would cost her $2,000 a year in
legal and accounting fees, plus the time needed to complete the
extra filings for taxes and the Department of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Having dealt with the tax consequences of divorce and
self-employment, in August she faced another major event with tax
implications. Shortly before she moved her office into her home,
she received a phone call from her uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, who had moved to Florida when she was widowed three
years earlier, had been killed in a car accident in a small town in
Mississippi while returning from her new boyfriend's Army reunion.
And so Ms. Goldstein took on a new role: executor of her mother's
estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I had to find out what and where everything was,'' she
said. She and her brother flew to Florida. ``My aunt found a file,
but then we had to play detective. Then we found a list of assets,
neatly written out and updated every six months. My father had
started tracking their investments and mutual funds in 1985. My
brother and I sat down with three massive boxes and sorted
everything into piles.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the stock market dropped during the late-summer
selloff. As executor, Ms. Goldstein chose to value the estate as of
the day after death. The IRS also permits executors to value an
estate as of six months after the date of death.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of Ms. Goldstein and her brother, their parents
had saved a considerable amount of money. The estate was worth more
than $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   Her windfall comes with its own tax consequences. Starting this
year, Ms. Goldstein will owe a tax on distributions made by the
individual retirement accounts she inherited from her parents.
</P>
<P>
   But, in a sense, her business is coming to the rescue. To
minimize the taxes she pays, she has decided to start that Keogh
plan for her business income.

<P>
   Ah, retirement, and early retirement at that. Trips to Hawaii
and Mexico. Lazy days restoring a sailboat.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the activities of Ken and Marilyn Rocky of
Little Silver, N.J., who are now planning to travel to England,
having just returned from Puerto Vallarta. They have started on a
life of travel and a pursuit of their own interests _ and are
loving it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the back of my brain, I always figured that I would retire
at 59,'' Rocky said. ``My definition of failure was to be still
working at 60.''
</P>
<P>
   By that definition, the Rockys are super successes. Rocky
retired a year ago at age 55 from his job as a district manager for
AT&AMP;T. Mrs. Rocky, who is the same age as her husband, runs her own
business as a management consultant but has plenty of time to
travel with her husband. They have no children.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky took advantage of a company buyout; he took a lump-sum
pension payment and rolled it over into an individual retirement
account. He also got other goodies, like a year's salary. In
addition, the Rockys have Mrs. Rocky's earnings, and the stock
market has been relatively good to them.
</P>
<P>
   On the advice of their accountant, Doug Stives of Curchin &AMP; Co.
in Red Bank, N.J., the Rockys have made some financial moves and
are planning others to keep their taxes in retirement as low as
possible. Tax laws affecting retirees were already complicated, and
with new provisions in effect for 1998 returns, the situation is
even more complex.
</P>
<P>
   One of Stives' admonitions involves what assets to use for
everyday living. ``The strong advice I try to give retirees is:
Don't plan on living on those types of assets that are tax-deferred
until after-tax assets have been exhausted'' _ especially for
someone like Rocky, who is not yet 59{ and could thus face a 10
percent early-withdrawal penalty, Stives said.
</P>
<P>
   Early retirees can arrange a penalty-free withdrawal from a
retirement account before 59{, but complex rules require a minimum
five-year payout to avoid a 10 percent penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The tax-deferred assets include IRAs and what are known as
qualified plans _ that is, pension plans, 401(k)s, Keogh plans and
similar retirement plans. For the Rockys, Stives advises living on
Mrs. Rocky's earnings and the money in their nondeferred savings
and stock portfolio before withdrawing any money from the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   The reason _ beyond any penalties _ is that when money is
withdrawn from a tax-deferred account, taxes are due on the full
amount as ordinary income. This can be taxed as high as 39.6
percent, although most taxpayers are in lower brackets.
</P>
<P>
   But for securities sold outside a tax-deferred plan, the tax
rate on any capital gain is just 20 percent; in the 15 percent tax
bracket, capital gains are taxable at only 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than take money out of your pension plan, I'd argue
it's better to sell off some of your Microsoft,'' Stives said. By
law, an individual must start taking money out of qualified plans
at age 70{. Rocky is 15 years away from that. With careful
planning, he could end up with four or five times what he now has
in his IRA, Stives said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockys, of course, could run out of assets to finance their
carefree retirement, but one help, Stives said, will be Social
Security, which Rocky can start tapping at age 62. The Rockys may
decide to defer Social Security beyond age 62 to increase their
monthly benefits. But part of their Social Security benefits will
be taxable, subject to the amount of their other income.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, the Rockys could sell their house and pocket a
capital gain on it of any amount up to $500,000 without paying a
cent in tax. Of course, they would have to buy or rent another
place to live, perhaps a condominium or something smaller than
their suburban home.
</P>
<P>
   As for the IRA money, Stives hopes the Rockys will roll some of
it over into a Roth account. This may be heresy to some, since Roth
accounts are seen by many advisers as primarily for younger
investors. Converting an IRA into a Roth account makes one liable
for taxes on the money converted _ but then it lets the account
holder or a beneficiary withdraw the money tax-free, no matter how
much it has grown.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a retiree must find the money to pay the one-time
tax bill gives people pause, especially because a provision that
allows taxpayers to spread the tax bite over four years ended last
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   People with adjusted gross incomes below $100,000 can take any
chunk of IRA money and roll it over into a Roth. The Rockys expect
a gross income of $50,000 to $60,000 from Mrs. Rocky's earnings,
their investment income and other sources. With deductions and
exemptions, their taxable income may be about $25,000, putting them
in the 15 percent tax bracket.
</P>
<P>
   They could have about $18,000 more in taxable income before
being bumped up into the 28 percent bracket. Stives recommends that
they fill up the 15 percent bracket by rolling over $18,000 of IRA
funds into a Roth IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the funds in an ordinary IRA, the money in a Roth never
has to be withdrawn. Roth money can be left to a spouse and
children, and it continues to be free of income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Can other workers in their 50s do what the Rockys are doing?
``It is not always feasible,'' Stives said. ``We have a number of
clients who come in and say they have accumulated a million bucks
with equity in their house and stock winnings, and they think they
can retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think that if they can get 7 percent on their money, they
can live quite well,'' he added. ``They neglect to consider that
equity in their house is not income-producing.'' He points out to
them that they may live 40 or 50 years more and could use up their
assets quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees often don't realize that their spending may well
increase after retirement, and that medical expenses can eat up
life savings at the worst possible time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are also forgetting inflation,'' he said. ``I can
guarantee we'll see it one day again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical person is in some cases in a dream world because
he made 30 percent on his stock portfolio, but you can't depend on
that continuing,'' Stives added.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme are people who avoid any investment risk
and make 3 percent or so on their money. Stives favors a happy
medium.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Rockys, Stives said he thought they could make
retirement work. If worse comes to worst, Rocky can always take
another job. Indeed, he worked one day as a consultant, but that
seems to have fulfilled his need for employment. ``Get over it,''
he told himself.

SENATORS' `CALL FOR RECONCILIATION' GOES LARGELY UNANSWERED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change Friday to Thursday throughout. No other changes.)  (mk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As signs go, it was not a good one.
</P>
<P>
   Striving to bury the biliousness of impeachment, Sens. Sam
Brownback, R-Kan., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., issued press
releases early this week announcing a bipartisan ``call for
reconciliation.'' All senators were invited to ``pull together and
face the future with a collaborative spirit,'' as Lieberman put it.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday morning, in a meeting room bulging with gospel
singers, ministers, a rabbi and a priest, who all intoned about
tolerance, mercy and forgiveness, it was not at all evident that
``the call'' had been heard. There, at the very front of the room,
sat the attending senators, all six of them _ three Republicans and
three Democrats, though a flash sighting of Sen. John Ashcroft,
R-Mo., at the back of the room would bring the count to seven.
</P>
<P>
   Why the low turnout? Could it be, after all is said and done,
that the Senate is not so different from the House, where a
scheduled retreat on civility and congeniality in Hershey, Pa., has
prompted an onslaught of snickers instead of kisses, and threats of
a boycott?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God, no,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. ``It's so
acrimonious there,'' in the House, he added. ``It's so sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning's poor attendance was disappointing, senators
said. Those who showed up were the Democratic Sens. Daniel Akaka of
Hawaii, Charles Robb of Virginia and Dodd, and the Republicans
Sens. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Ted Stevens of Alaska, Jeff
Sessions of Alabama and Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
   But the meager showing was not a bad sign, many of them said: It
simply demonstrated how much progress members had already made in
reconciling their own differences over impeachment. With all 100 of
them thrust together on the Senate floor day after day, senators
bonded during the ordeal. The House, on the other hand, came
unglued, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This very divisive, troubling episode actually united us, as
men and women, as individuals who happen to be senators,''
Lieberman, who is co-chairman with Brownback of the Center for
Jewish and Christian Values, said Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The trial had ``its own salutary benefits,'' Dodd agreed. ``So
it may be that many members felt they had already, in a sense, gone
through a reconciliation with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the image of acrimony that the House is trying to buff
clean with its annual retreat on civility. This year, though, the
retreat has prompted even more eye-rolling than usual. Democrats
are not at all keen on the idea, calling it superficial. And some
Republicans aren't too enthused themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The House minority leader, Richard Gephardt, said Thursday that
he had encouraged Democrats to attend ``this thing in Hershey,''
but he cautioned, ``you only make progress slowly and
incrementally.''
</P>
<P>
   Reconciliation between President Clinton and Republicans in
Congress may be no less tricky. Brownback, for one, who voted to
convict Clinton and called for his resignation last year, has
invoked a lot of prayers to try to make that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had harbored a lot of ill will and dislike and, really,
hatred for the president,'' Brownback said after the meeting. ``I
have been praying for him and that has gone. I have forgiven him
and I hope he forgives me.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in the same breath, Brownback and other Republicans warned
that forgiveness and comity have little to do with policy and
legislating. Brownback will turn the other cheek, not give up his
backbone, he said, especially over abortion, tax cuts and
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure to separate out the difference between
reconciliation and genuine policy issues,'' he told reporters. ``I
will confront you on policy issues, and I will love you
personally.''

SWINGING THE TAX AX

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the better part of two decades, the federal
budget deficit imposed tight limits on debates over tax policy.
Republicans could not indulge their political and ideological
desire to return more money to the people. Democrats were forced to
support tax increases to maintain spending for the social programs
they championed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the advent of large and growing budget surpluses, the
terms of the debate are being rewritten. No longer shackled by the
demands of austerity, Republicans are pressing for a big tax cut
this year, although they remain divided over the form and the size.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is trying to thwart the Republican
plan by demanding that Social Security and Medicare get first dibs
on the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   While the political fight this year and probably into the 2000
elections will center on that shorthand _ tax cuts versus saving
Social Security _ there is also a growing focus on another, older
and more fundamental issue. Should tax policy focus simply on
raising the revenue needed to pay for the activities of government?
Or can the tax code be used as an effective instrument to address
the nation's social and economic ills?
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is emerging as a determined advocate of the
engineering approach, proposing to use tax law in myriad narrowly
focused ways to help specific groups and encourage particular
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Because the rules that govern the federal budget process make it
all but impossible to create new spending programs, politicians are
becoming increasingly creative in using tax credits and other
breaks to direct money toward what they see as compelling problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the budget he sent to Congress this month, Clinton could not
propose spending $5 billion to help families with the costs of
long-term health care or $3.7 billion to help communities replace
or modernize crumbling schools. But under the budget rules, he was
able to allocate those amounts to those needs through tax credits.
And these are just a few of dozens of examples.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last few years, the dominant view has been one that
regards the income tax system as if it were chicken soup _ a magic
elixir to address any of the nation's social and economic
problems,'' said Michael J. Graetz, a professor at Yale Law School
and a former Treasury Department official. ``Mr. Clinton's budget
is only the most recent example. It seems to be becoming more and
more extreme all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans object to most of Clinton's proposals. And many of
them advocate either streamlining the income tax system or
replacing it with a new approach, perhaps a tax on consumption.
They would wipe out the numerous so-called targeted provisions that
critics say make the current tax code horrifically complex and
inefficient.
</P>
<P>
   But for all their talk of driving a stake through the heart of
the Internal Revenue Service, most Republicans in the end go along
with the practice of loading up the tax code with provisions
intended not just to raise money but also to reward specific
companies, industries, groups or people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pendulum seems to have swung about as far as it's ever
gone in terms of these little tweaks and twists and doodads
intended to reach targeted objectives,'' said Gregory F. Jenner, a
partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and most congressional Democrats
object to across-the-board reductions in income tax rates,
contending that they benefit the wealthy disproportionately. They
say that targeted tax breaks insure that help goes to those who
need it most, and that they can enact a modest package of such cuts
this year without having to spend any of the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Two examples of the approach they favor are the earned income
tax credit for the working poor, which was expanded in 1993, and
the tax credit for lower- and middle-income families with children
that was instituted in 1997. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin
said that these moves have given a family of four with half the
median income the lowest income and payroll tax burden in 31 years.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the targeted approach has long since gotten out
of hand.
</P>
<P>
   The more the tax code deals with additional social and economic
issues, the further it moves from the notion that people with equal
incomes should pay equal taxes. Moreover, each new tax break
creates more complexity; the child credit that many people will be
able to claim for the first time during this filing season required
a new work sheet and, for families with three or more children, a
new form, and has proved to be a headache for many taxpayers,
despite the ultimate reward of up to $400 a child on 1998 tax
returns.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``They are exponentially increasing complexity, particularly for
the middle class, which up until recently had not been the
beneficiaries of these targeted initiatives,'' Jenner said.
</P>
<P>
   In pushing for an across-the-board income tax rate reduction of
10 percent or more, Republican leaders say they want to provide
relief for all taxpayers, not just a chosen few, and to do so in
the simplest possible way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taxpayers won't be denied a tax cut simply because they don't
behave the way the government thinks they should or don't fall into
a certain government-prescribed category,'' said Rep. John R.
Kasich, R-Ohio, who is chairman of the House Budget Committee and a
presidential hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich, who derided the White House's targeted approach as being
for ``left-handed cab drivers in New York,'' said reducing each of
the five income tax rates by 10 percent would mean that ``taxpayers
will not have to fill out new forms or decipher complicated
instructions to get their tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all Republicans agree, and Kasich signaled last week
that he might have to scale back his plan to win support for it
within the party.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans want to phase in any tax cut more slowly than
Kasich has proposed. Moderate Republicans in the House prefer a
package of cuts aimed at the middle class because they do not want
to be accused by the Democrats of giving most of the benefits to
the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates are rallying around an alternative plan that would
provide narrowly drawn tax reductions _ largely for the middle
class _ including scaling back the so-called marriage penalty,
which leaves many couples in which both spouses work and have
fairly similar incomes with a higher tax bill than that of two
single people with the same incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates also want further increases in the amount of money
retirees can earn before Social Security benefits become taxable.
And they favor steps to restrict the impact of the alternative
minimum tax on people who claim the new child and education
credits.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan includes a variety of poll-tested tax proposals
to deal with health care, child care, education, the environment
and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   They include a proposed $1,000 credit to help offset the costs
of long-term health care, tax credits for employers who set up
literacy and basic education programs in the workplace, an
elimination of the 60-month limit on the deductibility of student
loan interest, an increase in the credit for child care expenses
and an expansion of a tax credit for the purchase of fuel-efficient
and low-emission vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The White House strategy over the last few years has been to
propose as many initiatives as it can stuff into its budget and
then negotiate hard to force the Republican Congress to include a
few of them in the final tax and spending laws passed at the end of
the session.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus could provide enough wiggle room to accommodate both
parties, up to a point. But it remains unclear, in the aftermath of
impeachment and with the 2000 election looming, whether either side
wants a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The early signs are that this year could be one in which both
sides make their arguments for what fiscal policy should look like
at the dawn of the 21st century, and then let the voters decide.

COMMISSION SAYS U.S. GAVE AID IN GUATEMALA GENOCIDE
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
 
  GUATEMALA CITY _ A truth commission report has concluded that the
United States gave money and training to a Guatemalan military that
committed ``acts of genocide'' against its Mayan people during the
most brutal armed conflict in Latin America, Guatemala's 36-year
civil war.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The report of the Historical Clarification Commission, which was
released on Thursday, breaks years of official silence about the
torture, kidnapping and execution of thousands of civilians in a
war that the commission estimated killed more than 200,000
Guatemalans.
</P>
<P>
   Although the broad outlines of American support to Guatemala's
military have been known, the nine-volume report provides more
detailed information about how the Central Intelligence Agency and
the Defense Department aided Guatemalan military forces.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, established as a part of the peace accord that
ended the war in 1996, concluded that the government or allied
paramilitary groups were to blame for more than 90 percent of the
42,000 deaths the commission documented after an 18-month
investigation. That is a far higher percentage of deaths attributed
to the government and its allies than a report last year by the
Roman Catholic church that examined human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The commission specifically named military intelligence as the
organizers of illegal detentions, torture, forced disappearances
and executions, and it said that many massacres were a direct
result of government policy. It stopped short, however, of
identifying individuals responsible for various massacres.
</P>
<P>
   As the conclusions of the long-awaited report were read at a
solemn ceremony at the National Theater, human rights workers,
relatives of victims and others among the more than 2,000 people
broke into standing ovations, sobs, shouts and chants of ``Justice!
Justice!''
</P>
<P>
   The outbursts repeatedly interrupted speeches as the president
and cabinet members sat silently on the theater's first row.
</P>
<P>
   While the scope of the bloodshed had been generally known, the
report is the first by an internationally supported panel to lay
out the extent of the violence. In unexpectedly strong language, it
describes the Guatemalan policy at the height of the war as a
policy of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The report's estimate of more than 200,000 deaths is slightly
higher than previous figures, and the number of documented
massacres substantially exceeds figures used in previous
examinations.
</P>
<P>
   The war pitted a right-wing military-controlled government
against a classic Latin American left-wing insurgency. Largely a
rural war carried out in the hinterlands where Mayan Indians lived,
the military assumed that the Mayans sympathized with the
insurgents and provided them with supplies, intelligence and
shelter. As a consequence, entire Mayan villages were attacked,
burned and inhabitants were slaughtered in an effort to deny the
guerrillas protection. The report said the Mayan population paid
the highest price, when the military identified them as natural
allies of the guerrillas. The result, the report said, was an
``aggressive, racist and extremely cruel nature of violations that
resulted in the massive extermination of defenseless Mayan
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian Tomuschat, the German jurist who lead the commission's
18-month investigation, said, ``The results of our investigation
demonstrate that in general, the excuse that midlevel commanders
acted with a wide margin of autonomy _ an excuse used in an attempt
to justify what happened as ``excesses'' and ``error'' not ordered
by superiors _ is unsubstantiated and totally lacking any basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission recommended a national reparations program for
victims and exhumations of ``hundreds'' of clandestine cemeteries.
It called on President Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen and the ex-guerrilla
commanders to assume responsibility in the name of the state and
ask all Guatemalans for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The three-member commission and an international staff of 272
workers made extensive use of declassified documents from the
United States, which fortified the Guatemalan armed forces with aid
and training in its anti-Communist campaign. On Thursday, Tomuschat
said the commission's investigation also found that until the
mid-1980s, American companies and government officials ``exercised
pressure to maintain the country's archaic and unjust socioeconomic
structure'' and that the CIA supported illegal counterinsurgency
operations here.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The commission did not give specific names of human rights
violators, the result of military opposition during the peace
negotiations to pointing fingers at specific people.
</P>
<P>
   But some victims' families said no true reconciliation can be
achieved in Guatemala without judicial accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be an end to impunity,'' said Helen Mack, whose
sister, Myrna, was stabbed and killed in 1990, it is believed, for
her research on the refugees driven from their homes by the army.
The case resulted in the only conviction yet of an army official
for human rights violations, and Ms. Mack is pursuing the trial of
three other officers for her sister's murder.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the weight of nine years of struggle with
Guatemala's ineffective judicial system seem to fall on her as she
broke into tears at the National Theater as the commission's
conclusions were read.
</P>
<P>
   ``We the victims feel vindicated,' she later said. ``No one can
now tell us we're following lies or ghosts anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Guatemalan officials said on Thursday that they would have a
response after they have studied the report. The army leadership
has remained defiant, accusing international and national
``actors'' for their roles in the violence and insisting the
military acted under a constitutional mandate to defend the state
from communism.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the accusations against the CIA by the commission,
the spokesman for the intelligence agency, Bill Harlow, said,
``Since we have not seen the report, it would be inappropriate for
us to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Hector M. Barrios, who has promised his own
report on the war dead and injured, said Thursday, ``I see as
positive any effort that is made on behalf of peaceful co-existence
in Guatemala.''
</P>
<P>
   Arzu left without comment after shaking hands with members of
the commission and those formally receiving the report _ the U.N.
subsecretary general, Alvaro de Soto, and representatives of the
Guatemalan government and the ex-guerrilla group, Guatemalan
National Revolutionary Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said protocol prevented the president from personally
accepting the report, but that decision was seen by many here as
intentionally distancing the government from the commission's
findings. At several points on Thursday, people in the theater
shouted for the president to get up on stage and receive the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Affairs Minister Eduardo Stein said the government was
already implementing some of recommendations, including
compensation for victims, judicial reform and changes in the
military. Political repression has greatly been reduced in
Guatemala, by most accounts, and the guerrillas have regrouped as a
political party. There has also been a rise of Indigenous rights
and human rights organizations _ the changing times were
underscored on Thursday when scores of Guatemalans openly
confronted government officials in angry outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   But the country is still wrestling with its transition to a full
democratic state. Stark poverty and economic inequalities remain.
Despite a requirement under the peace accords that the army's size
and role be reduced, experts monitoring the progress say that there
has been checkered compliance and that the army still has a hold on
internal affairs, rather than being focused solely on the defense
of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   And just how fragile the peace is was shown last year when a
Roman Catholic bishop and leading defender of human rights, Juan
Jose Gerardi, was beaten to death with a concrete block just days
after making public the results of a three-year investigation of
human rights abuses during the war. That report, sponsored by the
Catholic church, identified specific military officers and
guerrilla groups, and church and human rights groups say they
believe the killing was meant to pressure them into renewed
silence.
</P>
<P>
   The most heart-felt applause at the National Theater Thursday
came when the bishop's name was mentioned as yet another political
victim. Many here feel the truth commission's report can help the
country's efforts toward change, but only if it is etched into the
public consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the end of the work,'' said Feliciana Macario, a
board member of a survivors' group called National Widows
Committee, which seeks reparations for the loss of homes and land
and ``moral damages,'' such as the psychological trauma suffered by
orphaned children. ``To us, this is the beginning of another
struggle.''

 &HT;    Wonderful writing carries sweet `Cider'
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't be put off by the badly titled ``Cider With Rosie'' on
Sunday's ``Masterpiece Theatre'' (9 p.m. on WGTV). It's a delicate,
sometimes absorbing retelling of writer Laurie Lee's early years in
rural England in the days before and after World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Lee does have a fabulous way with words. Read his thoughts about
his dear mum: ``Deserted, debt-ridden, flurried, bewildered, doomed
by ambitions that never came off, yet our Mother possessed an
indestructible gaiety which welled up like a thermal spring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cider'' often relies on Lee as narrator, speaking his own
written words as the 90-minute tale unfolds, introducing us to the
kooky characters populating the countryside where he lived as a
boy. There's the two warring old women, the crabbiest of
schoolmarms, the somewhat Boo Radley-like shell-shocked soldier
and, ultimately, the schoolgirl Rosie young Laurie sips cider with
before experiencing his first kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie's mom Annie (wonderfully played by Juliet Stevenson
(``The Politician's Wife'')) is as charming, gay and tragic as
Roberto Benigni's clown Guido in ``Life Is Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the adolescent Laurie, Joe Roberts has the kind of
remarkable, big-eared, dopey kid look you just know you've seen
somewhere before. Then it hits you. He played the rat-loving John
Webster in ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   On the down side, PBS' adaptation of ``Cider With Rosie'' isn't
as Gothic, as wide-eyed, as just plain big as you'd want from a
world seen through the eyes of a bright, intuitive kid. ``To Kill a
Mockingbird'' it's not. But it is charming at times. Enough so to
make you yearn for a sip of cider.
</P>

   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   This is only a test
</P>
<P>
   A test of the Emergency Alert System apparently freaked out a
few viewers of CBS' ``Late Show With David Letterman'' and other
shows Wednesday night. The scheduled ``alert,'' which usually comes
on during low-viewership times, popped on the screen on all of
MediaOne's channels for 15 seconds and told viewers to tune to WSB
for more information.
</P>
<P>
   The new testing system replaces the old Emergency Broadcasting
System, which used to come on radio and TV stations, followed by a
long, annoying beep. The Federal Communications Commission requires
cable systems such as MediaOne to test the system once a week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Phil Kloer, TV writer for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Gangster flick falls flat
</P>
<P>
   Oy. A movie this promising that's this disappointing.
Slow-footed when it's not ham-handed, foggy when it's not obvious,
HBO's ``Lansky'' (8 p.m. Saturday (874621)), a bio-pic about Jewish
gangster Meyer Lansky, shudda been a contender. It was written by
David Mamet, -- Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright (``Glengarry Glen
Ross'') and acclaimed screenwriter (``Wag the Dog''). Richard
Dreyfuss (``Mr. Holland's Opus'') stars as Lansky, with the
supporting cast filled out by Eric Roberts, Anthony LaPaglia,
Ileana Douglas and Beverly D'Angelo. John McNaughton (``Henry:
Portrait of a Serial Killer'') directs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this virtually cradle-to-grave tale of the brainy immigrant
bad guy, who with Bugsy Siegel (Roberts) and Lucky Luciano
(LaPaglia) helped assemble a Prohibition crime syndicate he once
described as ``bigger than U.S. Steel,'' never finds a way to
involve us. Is that even possible? 'Tis. Told through flashbacks of
a 70-year-old Lansky, waiting in Jerusalem to hear if he can take
up permanent residence there (he wound up standing trial in the
United States on racketeering-related charges, but wasn't convicted
and finally died in Miami in 1983), we're left to divine that
anti-Semitism drove him to a life of crime, and also drove him to
be very good at it. We're never convinced. Dreyfuss as the
in-his-prime Lansky brings brief moments of the thinking-man's,
wise-guy charge you expect from this film, but ``Lansky'' otherwise
is snuffed out of its own too-vague intentions.

JOHNSON TAKES STOCK OF BORBON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ When Dodgers manager Davey Johnson ventured
to the Dominican Republic in December, Pedro Borbon couldn't pitch
because his reconstructed left elbow was giving him problems.
</P>
<P>
   Borbon has come a long way. Through the first week of spring
training, the left-hander is the biggest surprise at Dodgertown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he'd be throwing this good,'' Johnson said
after watching Borbon throw eight minutes on Thursday. ``He looked
pretty good. I think he's ahead of where anyone thought he would
be. It looks like he has pretty good arm strength and endurance. .
. . I won't abuse him in the spring, but I'll give him a lot of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers would like to know if the former Atlanta Braves
reliever is healthy enough to fill the left-handed void in the
bullpen. Borbon, a non-roster invitee, is a long way from making
the Dodgers' roster, but even making it this far is somewhat
remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, Borbon suffered a torn medial collateral
ligament in his left elbow. A week later, he underwent
reconstructive surgery. He said damage was done to elbow ligaments,
his flexor muscle and the capsule that holds the elbow in place. He
spent last season in the Braves organization but was 0-3 with a
5.52 ERA at three stops in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was `Tommy John' surgery-plus,'' said Borbon, who was 3-0
with a 2.75 ERA with the Braves before the injury. ``It's been two
stressful years for me. I feel more relaxed for the simple reason
of what I've gone through the last 2{ years. Nothing is going to
bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Borbon said he's healthy and added he was clocked at 89 to 92
mph while pitching in a Dominican winter league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The injury, it made me a better pitcher,'' said Borbon, who
signed a minor- league contract with the Dodgers. ``I think the
Dodgers presented the best opportunity to come out of the pen.''
</P>
<P>
   Lineup talk: Johnson said he's played the fantasy baseball game
in his mind for the past few months, and there's one thing he
continuously returns to when thinking about right fielder Raul
Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Are you going to be on base enough to hit third?' ''
said Johnson, who wants to make sure cleanup hitter Gary Sheffield
has enough RBI opportunities. ``It has to work right in front of
Sheffield. Otherwise, I'll load it up behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi had a solid 1998 season, hitting .279 with 30 homers and
90 RBI, but drew only 30 walks in 580 at-bats for an on-base
percentage of .316. Last season he batted third 58 times and fifth
83 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're third, they don't want to walk me to face the
fourth hitter,'' Mondesi said. ``I want to hit third, and I'll show
everybody what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson likes Eric Young leading off, followed by Devon White,
Mondesi, Sheffield, Todd Hundley and Eric Karros. When Mark
Grudzielanek plays shortstop, he would hit seventh and Adrian
Beltre would bat eighth. If Jose Vizcaino is the shortstop, Beltre
would bat seventh and Vizcaino eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: The Dodgers announced an agreement with
the LG Twins of the eight-team Korean Baseball Organization that
could include an exhibition game. As part of the agreement, the
clubs will exchange scouting information and the LG Twins will
train at Dodgertown. . . Beltre, who slammed his right pinky in his
car door and needed two stitches Wednesday, threw on the side
Thursday but didn't hit. . . Dodgers president and CEO Bob Graziano
is expected to arrive in Dodgertown tonight. . . Closer Jeff Shaw
remains at his Ohio home awaiting the birth of his third child.
He's expected in camp a few days after his wife, Julie, gives
birth. He's the only Dodger not in camp.

NIXON DISCUSSES BLAMING KENNEDY FOR A KILLING IN NEW TAPES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Newly released transcripts of secretly recorded
White House tapes show President Richard M. Nixon brainstorming
about blaming President John F. Kennedy for the murder of South
Vietnam's leader, discussing plans to break into foreign embassies
and saying he and his aides would have been ``out of our minds''
not to spy on left-wing Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government murdered him,'' Nixon said of the president of
South Vietnam Ngo Dihn Diem, whose assassination in November 1963
preceded Kennedy's by three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it and you know it, too,'' Nixon told his press
secretary in May 1973. But while one of Nixon's aides fabricated
evidence implicating Kennedy in the killing, there is no known
record of a presidential assassination order, although Kennedy
regretted giving tacit American approval to the coup that led to
Diem's death.
</P>
<P>
   In the transcripts, Nixon twice discusses authorizing break-ins
at foreign embassies. In May 1973, he told his military aide, Gen.
Alexander M. Haig, ``There are times, you know, when, good God, I'd
authorize any means to achieve a goal abroad'' _ including ``the
breaking-in of embassies and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   That same month, he told his legal aide, J. Fred Buzhardt,
``When we get down, for example, to the break-in, the Chilean
Embassy _ that thing was a part of the burglars' plan, as a cover .
. . a CIA cover.''
</P>
<P>
   The transcript appears to refer to a break-in at the Chilean
Embassy in Washington by Nixon's secret White House team, known as
the plumbers. That team conducted the June 1972 burglary at
Democratic Party offices in the Watergate complex, which led to
Nixon's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   A break-in at the Chilean Embassy in Washington on May 13, 1972,
was reported to Washington police. No link was made to the White
House at the time, and none has been made since.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always a rumor that the plumbers hit the Chilean
Embassy,'' John Dean, Nixon's White House counsel during the
Watergate affair, said in an interview on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dean said one of the plumbers, James W. McCord Jr., a former CIA
officer, was thought to have used his knowledge of American
espionage against the Chilean Embassy as a bargaining chip after
his conviction for the Watergate break-in. McCord, now 78, has
rarely spoken about Watergate and could not be reached on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy was a likely target for American intelligence
eavesdropping, since the CIA had been ordered by Nixon to help
destabilize the government of Salvador Allende Gossens, the freely
elected Marxist president of Chile, who fell in a coup led by Gen.
Augusto Pinochet in September 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The 124 transcripts made public on Thursday, some of them
fragments of a sentence, some several pages long, had been kept
secret on national security grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes, recorded on a White House system installed by Nixon,
were formally released by the National Archives on Thursday.
Transcripts were prepared by the privately financed Nixon Library
and made public on its Web site (www.nixonfoundation.org).
</P>
<P>
   The material is part of the 201 hours of White House tapes
identified by an act of Congress as evidence of Nixon's ``abuse of
power.'' Those tapes were kept from the public during 22 years of
litigation by Nixon and, after his death, by his estate. They are a
fraction of the 3,600 hours of tape recordings from the Nixon White
House that eventually will be made public.
</P>
<P>
   John H. Taylor, executive director of the Nixon Library in Yorba
Linda, Calif., said in an interview that the abuses of power with
which Nixon was charged should be understood in the context of the
times, more than a quarter-century ago, amid social skirmishes over
race and class and sex, political battles over the future of the
country and more than 50,000 Americans dead in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Nixon was a wartime commander in chief,'' Taylor said.
``We were in a culture war then. And what the culture tends to
remember as the domestic abuses of Watergate can only be understood
in the context of these challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon and his most senior aides spent hours discussing plans to
use federal law enforcement agencies and intelligence services to
conduct domestic spying operations against Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Nixon personally approved the most radical of these
plans. It was called ``the Huston plan,'' after its author, Tom
Charles Huston, a White House aide. J. Edgar Hoover, director of
the FBI, blocked its full implementation five days later. Dean, who
in 1973 decided to cooperate with federal investigators in the
Watergate case, took a copy of the Huston plan with him when he
left the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In the new transcripts, Nixon and his aides worry aloud about
the plan becoming public. One fragmentary transcript shows the
White House wondering if elements of the plan survived after Hoover
died in May 1972 and was succeeded by an acting FBI director loyal
to the Nixon White House, L. Patrick Gray.
</P>
<P>
   In the Oval Office on May 16, 1973, Buzhardt told Nixon about
his discussions with the deputy director of the National Security
Agency, Louis W. Tordella, about the Huston plan. The NSA conducts
international electronic eavesdropping, but like the CIA, it is not
supposed to spy on Americans at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything the NSA did is totally defensible,'' Nixon said,
referring to the Huston plan.
</P>
<P>
   Buzhardt replied: ``They move into a broader category with
respect to domestic affairs'' _ an illegal realm.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean?'' Nixon asked. ``Electronic surveillance?''
</P>
<P>
   Buzhardt replied, ``Yes, sir, targeting U.S. citizens'
conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon appeared unsure that the Huston plan had been turned off.
``DIA says that _ thinks it was terminated?'' he asked, referring
to the Defense Intelligence Agency, a Pentagon service that was
part of the Huston plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think it was terminated,'' Buzhardt said. ``Now, we're
going to check this thoroughly with NSA'' because ``they were the
most aggressive group.'' Referring to Tordella's notes on the
Huston plan, Buzhardt added: ``They never quite got a handle on it
until Pat Gray was appointed'' in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   In that same conversation, Nixon anticipated a story saying
``the president authorized a super-duper activity in 1970''
involving ``burglary, etc., and wiretapping.'' Defiantly, he said
Americans would understand the plan was to control riots by people
protesting the Vietnam War.

 &HT;    Back on track: Assist from coach Kersee worked for Jordan
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ When Brian Jordan had a bulging disc in
his back that kept him out for the second half of the 1997 season
for St. Louis _ the last in a succession of injuries that has
slowed his career _ he had all kinds of advice thrown his way.
</P>
<P>
   Fans sent a stack of mail with advice on exercises, miracle
healers, drugs. One fan even sent him some pills with instructions
on what to take when.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was that day at the Chesterfield Mall in St. Louis,
when Jordan bumped into a man he hardly knew, Bob Kersee, Olympic
track coach and husband of heptathlon champion Jackie
Joyner-Kersee. He offered to be Jordan's personal trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up to me and laid it on the line: `Hey, it's your
career. If you want to blow it, fine,''' Jordan said. ``I don't
even know this guy, he's telling me this, and I want to punch him
in his mouth. But he kind of woke me up. He said `It's your body.
You've got to take care of it. It's your career.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan thought about it and called Kersee back. He went to
Orlando to work out with Kersee, Jackie Joyner-Kersee and sprinter
Gail Devers. The results included faster sprint times, stronger
legs and a lower percentage of body fat. And then came his 1998
season with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan had career highs in average (.316), games (150), at-bats
(564), hits (178), home runs (25), runs (100), on-base percentage
(.368) and triples (7). He also drove in 91 runs.
</P>
<P>
   And Jordan did all that in the last year of his contract,
hitting in front of or behind Mark McGwire during the year of The
Chase.
</P>
<P>
   Two years and $40 million later, Jordan is in Orlando again,
this time with the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty much the complete player,'' Braves manager Bobby
Cox said. ``I don't know one thing he does poorly or even below
average. Plus arm, plus defense, plus speed, plus power, plus
batting average.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Braves latest free-agent pick-up, Jordan arrived in a
position to make a good lineup that much better. That changed with
the loss of Andres Galarraga to lymphoma. Jordan might have to come
in, hit cleanup and be a key contributor right from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard that news, it messed me up a little bit,'' Jordan
said. ``You think you're coming in, putting your piece of the
puzzle in and relaxing with that lineup. Now I may be the cleanup
hitter. Not that it matters. As long as I'm in the lineup, I'm
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is that matter of hitting in the same spot where fans
watched Galarraga produce 44 home runs and 121 RBIs. But Jordan
doesn't expect that kind of production from himself. He's not that
kind of hitter.
</P>
<P>
   He's got power, but he thrives in a situation that requires him
to bear down with two outs, two strikes and a runner in scoring
position. Jordan led the National League in 1996 by hitting .422
with runners in scoring position. Last season, that number was
.311.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't strike him out very often,'' Cox said. ``He's always
going to put the ball in play. When a guy does that, he has a knack
for driving in runs. He fights the pitchers. Pitcher gets him 0-2,
pitcher's still not ahead of him. He'll foul a lot of balls off. He
stays on breaking balls real well. Tough out _ that's how I've
always seen Brian Jordan from the other dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the choice between hitting 30 home runs and driving in 100
runs and scoring 100 runs, Jordan will take the RBIs and runs.
</P>
<P>
   And for Cox, that will be plenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want him just the way he was _ tough out, get in the
runs,'' Cox said. ``He does everything good. He's probably pretty
close to what he wants to be now. Let's face it; he just signed a
huge contract. We think he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan returns to Atlanta where he played for the Falcons
1989-91. He lives in Alpharetta during the offseason. It seems a
natural fit.
</P>
<P>
   There are only the little changes to make, like adding another 3
to his number. The Braves retired No. 3 for Dale Murphy, so Jordan
will be wearing 33. The stage is set for Jordan to make his own
name in the Braves outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to blend in,'' Jordan said. ``I don't consider
myself a superstar. I didn't hit 70 home runs or anything. I just
want to put my piece in, get 100 RBIs, score 100 runs.''
</P>
<P>
   One teammate who knows Braves fans well figures Jordan will fit
in just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's already got the foundation set,'' Chipper Jones said.
``He's played in Atlanta for the Falcons. If he does anything that
resembles what he did in St. Louis last year, the fans are just
going to adore him.''

 &HT;    Graffanino sure trade imminent
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Tony Graffanino, who hit only .211 last
season, returned to camp knowing he's likely to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Graffanino knows Bret Boone is expected to start at second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see the roster. I can see what the team is going to look
like,'' Graffanino said. ``Now, I've got to take care of myself.
I've got to come in here and be the best player I can be and,
hopefully, make a situation for myself somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Graffanino is out of options, which means that if he's sent back
to the minor leagues he has to go through waivers, in which case
other teams can claim him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping I was in the (Boone) trade, just so I didn't have
to worry about this kind of situation,'' Graffanino said. ``But I
wasn't, so I just took care of the things I could take care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Graffanino worked out at Life University near his Marietta home,
shed 10 pounds and tried to get himself close to midseason form.
</P>
<P>
   Graffanino came up through the Atlanta organization as a
promising second baseman, broke into the majors in 1996 and became
a starter when Mark Lemke got hurt in August, 1997. But an ankle
injury last spring slowed Graffanino, and he never fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time the season started, I wasn't in any kind of
shape,'' Graffanino said. ``A couple weeks in, I wasn't playing as
much as I hoped, and when I did get in there, I tried to do too
much. In one game, I tried to make myself the every-day starter.''
</P>
<P>
   A .275 hitter in the minors, Graffanino managed only 61 hits and
22 RBIs in 289 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm a better baseball player than that,'' Graffanino
said. ``I'm not going to dwell on it, because there wasn't too much
good that came out of it, except that I know I can handle it.
Mentally, I can deal with anything that comes my way.''
</P>
<P>
   TALK, TALK
</P>
<P>
   The trade rumors are swirling. Published reports are circulating
that the Braves are interested in Frank Thomas and Barry Bonds.
They leave Braves manager Bobby Cox and general manager John
Schuerholz incredulous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they do that because you lose a big guy (in Andres
Galarraga),'' Cox said. ``First, there was Frank Thomas; we haven't
talked to the White Sox. Then, it's Barry Bonds. We haven't talked
to the Giants. They assume you have interest in those guys. We're
set to do with what we've got here unless something pops us.''
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Gerald Williams reported to camp Thursday, bringing
the total in camp to 51 players, all that had been expected. ...
Minor-league first baseman Randall Simon agreed to terms on
Thursday, leaving only two players on the 40-man who have not yet
signed _ Andruw Jones and Kevin Millwood.

 &HT;    Cink hoping to repeat history with Woods
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ A successful old college try fortifies
Stewart Cink today in the third round of the Andersen Consulting
Match Play Championship at the LaCosta Resort. Meeting Tiger Woods
with an eventual $1 million on the table, Cink enters the 10:20
match neither intimidated by the situation nor lacking confidence
in his game.
</P>
<P>
   While a 1995 match at Druid Hills Golf Club is found in none of
golf's history books, it remains prominent in Cink's 25-year-old
mind. Granted, it was only an exhibition between Georgia Tech and
Stanford, but Cink shot a brilliant 6-under-par 66 to totally
domiante the freshman Woods. A few days later at Dalton, Ga., in
the Carpet Captial Collegiate tournament, Cink beat a field that
included Woods, who was on his way to
</P>
<P>
   Augusta in his first appearance as U.S. Amateur champion.
</P>
<P>
   Most players have no clue what they might do in a head-to-head
encounter with Woods. At least Cink knows how he did it once.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have a little bit of history with him,'' Cink said
Thursday. ``There's probably not that many matches in this
tournament that have happened before. I know I haven't forgotten
about it and he hasn't forgotten about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Having noticed early in the week how the bracket could fall,
Cink did his part to make it happen by beating Australia's Craig
Parry 3 and 2 Thursday. Woods, meanwhile, was taken to 18 holes by
former Marietta high school player Bob Tway before winning, 1-up.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of playing with or against Woods is dealing with
the hoopla that surrounds the world's No. 1 player and the Match
Play's top seed. One of the PGA Tour's most focused, unflappable
players, Cink does not promise to be rattled out of his game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around him enough to know what to expect,'' Cink
said. ``I've seen him hit before. It's not like I'm going to drop
my jaw if he hits a 330-yard drive. . . . The golf course is still
the opponent. If I play my game and make some birdies, I can put
some pressure on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods is the only player seeded in the top 10 to remain in the
tournament after a second day of big-name pillaging. Falling
Thursday were No. 2 David Duval, No. 8 Vijay Singh, No. 9 Nick
Price and No. 10 Justin Leonard. The highest-seeded player on the
opposite bracket from Woods is No. 27 John Huston.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to survive a match like this and to get through to
the next round,'' said Woods, ``I am relieved, no doubt about it.''
</P>

 &HT;    Unfocused Duval `ready to go home'
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ David Duval could not deny it. Anxious for a
break from the PGA Tour and admittedly no fan of match play, his
mind might not have been totally focused in his second-round match
Thursday against Bill Glasson. His body was in Southern California.
His head already was back home in Jacksonville Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably didn't do too good of a job with that,'' said
Duval, who has dominated the PGA Tour for much of the past two
years, but could not handle Glasson, losing 2-1. ``I'm ready to go
home. I'm ready to get some rest and get focused for The Players
Championship through Augusta.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly a sweet 16 remaining in the $5 million Andersen
Consulting Match Play Championship, which plays third-round and
quarterfinal matches today. Duval led a second-day parade of more
big-name players to exit and never seemed pyched enough for a
five-day, seven-round battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there's two people who expected him (Glasson) to win,
and that was him and his caddie,'' Duval said. ``But I knew he
could beat me. I knew I'd have all I could handle and I did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My key was to stay with David, not let him get on a roll,''
Glasson said. ``I was lucky. If a guy is off, he's going to lose.
David was just a little off today.''
</P>
<P>
   ROMERO DOES IT AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's Eduardo Romero took three sudden-death holes to
defeat Greg Norman, adding a second scalp to his 60th-ranked
seeding. On Wednesday he knocked off England's Lee Westwood. Romero
was 3-down with four holes to play and pushed the match into
overtime by knocking a 7-iron to a foot at the 18th. Norman halved
the 20th hole despite driving the ball out of bounds. ``I pulled
it, landed it on the cartpath and went OB,'' Norman said. ``That is
just nothing but bad luck.'' His goals aimed beyond this week,
Romero wants to push himself into the top 50 on the world rankings
for a spot in the Masters. ``If you can play in the Masters, it is
fantastic. It is my dream.'' .. . Phil Mickelson faces Romero this
morning, having defeated friend Lee Janzen 2 and 1 Thursday.
Mickelson eagled the 12th hole with a 210-yard 6-iron to a foot,
then birdied the 13th with a 9-iron to four feet. ``This format is
the most mentally draining event,'' said Mickelson. ``My match
tomorrow is already creating a lot of anxiety and nervousness. It's
very difficult to sleep at night and knowing who you have to play,
but not knowing what you have to shoot.'' ... Fred Couples
continues to win while sounding like a beaten man. ``Tiger won a
close match because he's playing good,'' said Couples, who beat
Scott Hoch 1-up and faces Steve Pate this morning. ``I won a close
match because I was lucky. ... This stuff makes me so nervous, I
will be choking like a dog. . .. Emerging in the Presidents Cup as
a surprise hero, Japan's Shigeki Maruyama continued his U.S.
mastery, defeating Justin Leonard, 4 and 2. Asked whether the
Americans should be afraid of him, Maruyama said, ``No problem. I
want everybody to think I am a really funny guy.'' . . . Tway
passed three putts over the hole on his last three holes without
success in his bid to upset Woods. Emotionally drained in the
locker room, Tway also was in disbelief about the small crowds at
La Costa. ``There's more people at Quad Cities,'' he said.

TEXAS WHITE SUPREMACIST SENTENCED TO DIE FOR DRAGGING DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Subs 2d graf to make it clear that King is the white
supremacist. Subs 7th graf to correct the year that the death
penalty was reinstated to 1976, not 1973.) 
 (fe) 
 By RICK LYMAN 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ After two days of testimony from psychologists,
law-enforcement officials and the killer's weeping father, an East
Texas jury decided on Thursday that the world would be better off
without John William King in it.
</P>
<P>
   The seven men and five women on the jury _ its sole black
member, a corrections officer, acting as foreman _ decided in just
under three hours that King, a white supremacist, should die by
lethal injection for the 1998 murder of James Byrd Jr., a black
man, whose body was torn to pieces when dragged behind a pickup
truck down a rough rural road in the pine woods east of Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any prosecutor who enjoys getting a death penalty has just got
something wrong,'' District Attorney Guy James Gray said. ``You
temper your enthusiasm. But I am proud that my community stood up
and did what was right.''
</P>
<P>
   On his way out of the 110-year-old courthouse, where journalists
and several dozen onlookers awaited the decision on the lawn, King
was jeered by some, with taunts of ``Bye-bye!'' and ``Rot in
hell!'' Asked if he had anything to say to the Byrd family, King
smirked and responded with a vulgarism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't expect him to say, `God bless the Byrd family,'''
said Mary Verrette, one of the murdered man's sisters. ``It just
sums up the total personality of this young man.''
</P>
<P>
   After voting on Tuesday to convict King of capital murder, the
jurors had only two choices left on Thursday: death or life
imprisonment. Under a life sentence, King, 24, could have been
eligible for parole in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Only one white man has ever been executed in Texas for killing a
black person: a farmer who killed another white farmer's favorite
slave in the 1850s. Seven inmates have been executed thus far in
Texas in 1999, bringing the total number of executions in the state
to 171 since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   In voting for death, the jury rejected defense arguments that
King would not pose a threat to society if given life in prison and
that the virulent racism that led him to the murder was caused by
the conditions in Texas prisons, where he served a two-year
sentence for burglary in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The foreman, Joe Collins, said the jurors used District Judge
Joe Bob Golden's written instructions to guide them, step by step,
through their deliberations. Each time the judge's instructions
told them they needed to make a decision about the facts, they
talked it out and then voted, until finally they were left with the
ultimate votes of whether to convict and how to punish.
</P>
<P>
   Every single one of the votes, Collins said, was unanimous on
the first try.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence was overwhelming,'' he said. The decisive factor
in going for the death penalty, he said, was an 8-inch homemade
knife that Jasper jail officials recently found in King's cell.
``Obviously, the man still had a lot of hatred in his mind,''
Collins said.

 &HT;    Spinning wheels: Grand Prix hits finish line
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the first time in eight years, professional
cyclists will not race through the streets of Atlanta this spring.
The Atlanta Grand Prix is dead, or at least critically wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The event fell victim to Atlanta city officials, who wanted the
race to be held in the autumn and would not grant a spring permit,
and to last year's sponsor, which did not want a fall date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not come to a meeting of the minds,'' said Robin
Morton, competition director for race promoters Advantage
International.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1992, the race was held each spring for six years as the
First Union Grand Prix. In 1998, after First Union did not renew
its affiliation, the Outdoor Life Network assumed the $500,000
title sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   The event, held at Midtown's Piedmont Park and adjacent
neighborhoods, was one of the top two one-day races in the United
States. It drew top cyclists from throughout the world,
particularly in 1996, when the race was held three months before
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-hour cable Outdoor Life Network wanted to sponsor this
year's race, but only if it could be held in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (fall date) just didn't make sense to us,'' said Peter
Englehart, senior vice president for programming at OLN. ``We'd be
competing against some big events down there. ... We had concerns
about getting lost in the fall menu of sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern to OLN, Englehart said, was competition
from college and professional football. The sponsors also did not
like a fall race date because the world cycling championships are
held in the autumn and not many athletes would have committed to
the Atlanta event.
</P>
<P>
   The city did not want to allow the race to continue in the
spring because there are too many events already scheduled for that
time of year, according to a letter from the mayor's office. The
letter did not specify, but two of the biggest springtime events in
Atlanta are Freaknik and Music Midtown. Both draw thousands of
visitors and tax the city's resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The springtime is the busiest time of the year for major
events,'' City Hall aide Holly Mull wrote in a Sept. 2, 1998,
letter to Dave Chauner, the main promoter for Advantage
International. ``Each of the events we have in April and early May
negatively impact the adjacent neighborhoods and area businesses.
The City of Atlanta government is also impacted during this time
because manpower resources are stretched. For these reasons, we
will not be able to grant a permit for your event in the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Mull no longer works at City Hall, according to a telephone
receptionist there. The mayor's office did not return a reporter's
telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Halstead, the race promoter from 1992-98, acknowledged that
some Virginia-Highland residents had complained about the race
making its way through their neighborhood. Halstead said last year
he was planning to change the course venue away from Piedmont Park
and move the main staging area to Centennial Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   But Halstead sold his company, International Cycling
Productions, to Advantage in June 1998. And then Advantage ran into
the scheduling problems when it went to obtain the city permits.
Advantage and OLN say they would like to see the race return to
Atlanta, but both admit that they have not had any further
discussions with city officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point,'' Chauner said, ``we're hustling to nail down
1999.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer and Grambling coach
Doug Williams will be among the honorees at a pair of college
football award banquets in Atlanta this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer, who led the Volunteers to the national title last
season, will be honored by the Atlanta Touchdown Club Saturday as
its SEC and national coach of the year. Other coaches recognized

</P>
<P>
   Williams will be honored Saturday as the Sheridan Broadcast
Network holds its 25th annual All-American Awards banquet at the

 &HT;    Sprinting toward a record
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ask him about the chances of breaking the world
record, and a slight smile crosses the face of Maurice Greene.
Then, he catches himself. The bold predictions have been tempered,
if ever so slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Greene lines up as the favorite in the 60 meters in Saturday's
USA Indoor Track and Field Championships. A year ago, he clocked an
indoor world-record 6.39 seconds over a fast track in Madrid,
Spain. He rates the Georgia Dome oval equally fast. And after a
week of training and resting up here following competition in
Europe, he sounds ready for a show-stealing performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I'll produce something great,'' Greene said. ``That
track is so fast, I'm liable to go low 6.30. You might think I'm
just talking. If it comes out in the race, it's going to be a
beautiful thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then again, I'm not caring about the world record. I can't run
after the world record any more. That's not my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Been there, done that _ and it didn't work. Greene, bodacious
like most sprinters, spent last summer chatting about and chasing a
100-meter world record that never budged. Still, he ran away with
eight of 12 finals he entered and was ranked No. 1 by Track &AMP; Field
News. All of that came after he beat Olympic champion Donovan
Bailey at the 1997 World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, 24, still lives with the disappointment of failing to
advance from the quarterfinals of the 1996 Olympic Trials, where he
was slowed by a season-long strained hamstring. Soon after, he
relocated to Los Angeles to train with esteemed sprint coach John
Smith, whose current stable features Ato Boldon and Jon Drummond.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Greene is the top man at his craft, he aspires to notch
a gold medal in Sydney next year _ the license plate on his new
Mercedes SL500 reads MO GOLD _ and eventually go down as the best
sprinter ever.
</P>
<P>
   Better than Bailey and Linford Christie. Better than Carl Lewis,
even.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one of the biggest drives I have right now _ Olympic
gold medal,'' said Greene, who carries 175 pounds on his 5-foot-9
frame. ``I just want to keep getting better and better. I want to
be known as the all-time greatest sprinter. At this time, I'm not.
I have a lot of people I have to do stuff better than, because Carl
Lewis did so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that would help me is to just blow the (100-meter)
world record out of its misery right now. Everybody in 100 meters
right now _ me, Ato, Donovan, Frankie (Fredericks), Jon Drummond _
every time we step on the track, we run close to the world record.
I want to put it somewhere where it's not so close every time we
all step on the track.''
</P>
<P>
   While he's working up to it, Greene joins training partner
Drummond as a noble pitch man for the sport. Sunday, he lectured
the Atlanta Track Club on the comparison of sprinters and distance
runners. The next day, he and Drummond engaged in a
conflict-resolution discussion with a seventh-grade class at John
F. Kennedy Middle School, where top high jumper Tisha Waller is
doing a graduate-school internship.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just clicked with the kids,'' Waller said.
</P>
<P>
   Following his usual script, Greene will throw T-shirts into the
stands after taking on the sprint field, which includes among
others, his older brother Ernest, Drummond and Barcelona Olympic
bronze medalist Dennis Mitchell. Greene ordered before the season
more than 1,000 white shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always asking, 'Do you have a T-shirt? Do you have
a card?''' he said. ``I always said no, because I didn't. A lot of
us don't have stuff, so some of us give the shirt we have off our
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Greene may be the world's fastest man, his sponsor,
Nike, is glad to help.

 JASPER, Texas: Collins said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``He showed no signs of remorse for his actions,'' said Karen
Flowers, another juror. ``It's so terribly sad. When I first came
here, I kept looking at him, how young and handsome he is. I have a
son about the same age. I wanted to find something to save him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she said, she could not.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County Sheriff Billy Rowles said King had a rough night
in jail before the decision. ``He was cussing and throwing things
around,'' Rowles said. ``I think probably reality hit him sometime
in the last 24 to 36 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   King, usually a talkative prisoner, was moody and silent on
Thursday on the way to the county courthouse. ``He was not a happy
camper this morning,'' Rowles said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, when his father tearfully begged the jury to spare
his son's life, King had asked to be taken out of the courtroom. He
returned after his father's testimony with red, swollen eyes.
``That was a sign of humanity,'' Ms. Flowers said. ``It was the
first we had seen.''
</P>
<P>
   King was hustled out of town immediately after the sentence was
announced and by early afternoon was already at the James Byrd
Diagnostics Unit _ named for a former warden, unrelated to the
murdered man _ in Huntsville. From there, he will join the other
451 prisoners on Texas' Death Row.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said King, an avowed white supremacist whose arms
and torso are covered with racist tattoos, had killed Byrd, 49, a
man he did not know, after picking him up after midnight on June 7,
1998. With King, prosecutors said, were two other white men:
Lawrence Brewer, 31, whom King met in prison, and Shawn Berry, 23,
whom King has known since high school. Trial dates for the other
two have not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   King, who had joined a racist group called the Confederate
Knights of America while in prison, had written his own
constitution and bylaws for a chapter he hoped to start in Jasper,
to be called the Texas Rebel Soldiers. The murder of Byrd,
prosecutors said, was to bind the three white men together and to
gain enough attention to attract more members to their group.
</P>
<P>
   The trio picked up Byrd, who was walking home from a party and
was partially intoxicated and drove him to a remote area east of
town where he was beaten. Chains were tied around his ankles and he
was dragged behind Berry's pick-up truck for about three miles,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   A pathologist testified that Byrd had been alive and probably
conscious until he hit a roadside culvert that sheared his body in
two.
</P>
<P>
   The elder King had been present for all of his son's trial but
decided on Thursday he was not up to staying to hear the sentence.
Instead, early Thursday morning, the father and son were allowed a
moment together in the courthouse. The Rev. Ron Foshage, pastor of
St. Michael's Catholic Church in Jasper, accompanied the father to
the meeting but stayed out of earshot.
</P>
<P>
   He said the father and son embraced and talked quietly together
for a few moments. ``I think both of them know it was probably the
last time they would have physical contact with one another,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After the death sentence was announced, Foshage read a statement
from the elder King.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please pray for the Byrd family who have endured unimaginable
pain and loss,'' he read. ``Please pray for these jurors who have
shouldered a terrible burden. Please pray for our town of Jasper, a
community that remains strong though scarred by this unspeakable
act.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger King also left a written statement behind as he was
taken away to prison. Neatly written on lined paper and handed to
his lawyers, it read: ``Though I remain adamant about my innocence,
it's been obvious from the beginning that this community would get
what they desire; so I'll close with the words of Francis Yockey:
``The promise of success is with the man who is determined to die
proudly when it is no longer possible to live proudly.''' It was
signed, ``Sincerely, John W. King.''
</P>
<P>
   Yockey was a pro-Nazi writer who died in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors, meanwhile, said they were simply trying to do their
job and render a fair verdict, not to send any statement to the
world. They were just ``common citizens who felt going on the jury
was an obligation, not a privilege,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the selection of Collins, the sole black juror, as foreman
had not been intended as a message to the world, Ms. Flowers said,
though she knew that many would take it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe was just one of us, that's it,'' she said. ``We got in
there and kind of stumbled around and nobody wanted to do the job
and Joe volunteered to do it. It was never any statement. We never
looked at Joe as a black man. He's just a fine man.''

 &HT;    Presence of past, future Olympians may boost attendance
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Repeating a familiar theme, U.S. track czar Craig
Masback says it's not time to give up on Atlanta as host of the
national indoor championships.
</P>
<P>
   Better days are ahead, Masback predicts. Even so, nobody is
billing this as the breakthrough year for the USA Indoor Track and
Field Championships, six years into its 10-year contract at the
Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be (that) the meet came to town, took place and
left,'' said Masback, head of the U.S. track federation. ``You have
to have local people (involved), and we have to recognize the meet
as the most tangible athletic legacy of the '96 Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this point, the event hasn't been given a fair chance, but
we're getting a significant outpouring of local sponsors (including
the Atlanta Journal-Constitution) and citizens stepping up to be
involved in the organization of the meet. I would be surprised if
it paid off this year. It's a multiyear effort, and next year will
be the first year we see the benefits of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Masback revealed plans Thursday for the federation to open an
Atlanta office, staffed by a full-time administrator, to market
future indoor championships better.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of a crowd the latest edition will draw Saturday,
after preliminary events tonight, is anybody's guess. The meet's
average for its first four years here was 17,000, based on
exaggerated estimates. With an accurate count last year, it drew
8,874, only 6,474 paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly would hope to exceed that,'' Masback said.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the 1996 indoor championships, this year's field is
the strongest since the meet relocated from New York. A significant
reason is that the top two finishers here qualify for the indoor
world championships in Maebashi, Japan, where gold medalists can
earn $50,000, silver $20,000 and bronze $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Greene, the world's fastest man at 60 meters, figures to
be challenged by training partner Jon Drummond. Jeff Hartwig and
Melissa Mueller have cleared American records in the pole vault
this winter. The high jump has an equally dominant couple in
Atlanta resident Tisha Waller, who cleared an American women's
record 6 feet, 7 inches to win last year, and Atlanta Olympic gold
medalist Charles Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic decathlon champion Dan O'Brien is booked for the 60
hurdles and the long jump. Olympic gold medalist Gail Devers is
entered in the 60 meters. Suzy Hamilton, fresh from tying the
American record in the 800, moves up to the 1,500, and Regina
Jacobs figures to make a run at the American record in the 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   The meet also is a showcase for some possible future Olympians,
most notably ex-Southwest DeKalb teammates Angelo Taylor and
Terrence Trammell. Taylor, a Georgia Tech sophomore and the world's
No. 2-ranked 400-meter hurdler, is entered in the open 400.
Trammell, a South Carolina sophomore, is running the 60 hurdles
after clocking the second-fastest collegiate time ever in the 55
hurdles last weekend at the SEC championships.

 &HT;    AMS offering $25 tickets for March race
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The NASCAR Winston Cup circuit stops at Atlanta Motor
Speedway next month, and AMS is offering $25 tickets for the
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store 500 on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want everyone who follows Winston Cup on television to be
able to attend the (race),'' AMS president and general manager Ed
Clark said. ``We know the fans will love (AMS) and the experience
of being at the race in person.''
</P>
<P>
   The tickets, available while supplies last, are for seats in the
Weaver Grandstand overlooking the back straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets can be purchased at the AMS ticket office, 8 a.m.-6 p.m.
today, 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Saturday and 1-5 p.m. Sunday. Tickets also can
be purchased through Ticketmaster at 800-249-6400 or by direct
purchases at select Publix supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call the AMS ticket office at
770-946-4211.

<P>
   TV TIME
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR officials seem to be eyeing a $400 million price tag for
television rights to its Winston Cup and Busch Grand National races
when current contracts expire.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR announced Wednesday that it would retain the negotiating
rights from individual venues, beginning with some races during the
2000 season. The projected price would quadruple the $100 million
NASCAR is set to receive for its 34 Cup races this year.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the NFL commands $2.2 billion per year, the NBA
gets $660 million, Major League Baseball receives $340 million and
the NHL gets $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's TV ratings are consistently higher than all other
sports for regular-season events, except the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past 25 years, we've been so undervalued by TV,''
Humpy Wheeler said. Wheeler is president and chief operating
officer of Speedway Motorsports Inc., which owns six NASCAR venues,
including speedways in Atlanta, Charlotte and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The last three contracts negotiated for Winston Cup races at
Homestead, Fla., Las Vegas and Phoenix delivered about $5 million
per event, Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA TESTING
</P>
<P>
   Although the NASCAR circuit has a rare off week this weekend,
several Winston Cup and Busch drivers tested at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Mast had the fastest lap at Atlanta at 190.909 mph,
followed by Steve Grissom (190.843), Ricky Craven (189.344), Kenny
Wallace (189.150) and Robert Pressley (188.700).
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers say a second groove has formed on the 1.54-mile
oval of AMS, which allows more handling on the high side of the
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that a full second groove has finally worn in,''
Pressley said. ``We should be able to race side by side with very
little problem in March. When we were here in November, the second
groove was beginning, but it wasn't completely there.''
</P>
<P>
   MCREYNOLDS LEAVING CHILDRESS
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Winston Cup crew chief Larry McReynolds says he is
leaving Richard Childress Racing after this season. McReynolds, who
led Dale Earnhardt's crew in '97, was switched to Mike Skinner's
team after 13 races last season. Skinner leads the points standings
after two events this year.
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds, 40, plans to form his own team with John Dangler,
president of Indianapolis-based Performance Marketing Group. A
sponsor or potential car manufacturer for the new team, Motorsports
Performance, is still unclear.

TOBACCO-TEXAS 
 
STATE TRIES TO SNUFF OUT LAWYER'S BID FOR $260 MILLION FEE FROM
ANTI-TOBACCO SETTLEMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Attorney General John Cornyn asked a federal
judge Thursday to dismiss a claim by a Houston attorney who is
seeking as much as $260 million for legal fees in the state's
anti-tobacco suit, despite complaints by other lawyers that he did
little work.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said attorney Marc D. Murr, a friend of former Attorney
General Dan Morales, should go to the Texas Legislature if he wants
more than the $1 million he was awarded by a national arbitration
panel.
</P>
<P>
   But the Legislature's two chief budget-writers indicated that
Murr would have a hard time getting money from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my belief he added nothing to the process,'' said state
Rep. Rob Junell, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the national arbitration panel that awarded $1
million to Murr, a state arbitration panel of retired judges _
handpicked by Morales and Murr _ awarded the Houston lawyer $260
million. Junell called the state panel ``trumped up.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Bill Ratliff, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, said he would ask Murr, ``Where were you?''
</P>
<P>
   Junell and Ratliff spent several months last year helping
Morales negotiate a share of the tobacco settlement for counties
and hospital districts. They said they never saw Murr before he
showed up for a mediation session in federal court in Texarkana
last summer and they wouldn't let him participate. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Cornyn is still investigating Murr's role in the tobacco suit,
which resulted in a $17.3 billion settlement with cigarette makers
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office has said that Murr, who first
requested as much as half a billion dollars in fees, also is the
subject of a preliminary investigation by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry has agreed to pay Murr the $1 million
awarded by the national arbitrators in December. But cigarette
companies aren't bound to honor the state panel's $260 million
award, and Cornyn said the difference would have to come from the
state.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Murr hasn't asked U.S. District Judge David Folsom of
Texarkana, who presided over the tobacco suit, to confirm the state
arbitration award. But an aide to the attorney general said Cornyn
wanted to act before that happened.
</P>
<P>
   In his motion to Folsom, the attorney general said the court
lacked jurisdiction over Murr's claim because it had been separated
from the tobacco suit and didn't involve federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn also said Murr's claim amounts to a suit against the
state in federal court, which is barred by the 11th Amendment. And,
he said, the Legislature has not waived sovereign immunity to the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motion does not seek to answer the question of whether Mr.
Murr is entitled to any compensation for his work as outside
counsel, but instead seeks to transfer his claim from a federal
courtto the Texas Legislature, where it belongs,'' Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general said the state's settlement wouldn't be
affected by his action. Neither, he added, would the $3.3 billion
awarded by the national arbitrators to five other private lawyers
who represented the state.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry will pay the $3.3 billion over as many as
25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Murr nor his lawyer, Roy Minton of Austin, returned
phone calls from the Houston Chronicle. Morales also was
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The former attorney general, who left office Dec. 31, has called
Murr's assistance ``critical'' to the state's settlement. Murr has
claimed in documents to state and national arbitrators, that he
contributed as much as 2,000 hours of work to the anti-tobacco
effort and that he was an active adviser to Morales even before the
state's suit was filed in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Other people on both sides of the hard-fought case, however,
said Murr's participation was largely invisible until shortly
before the settlement was announced in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   During months of pretrial preparations in 1996 and 1997, Murr's
name didn't appear on hundreds of court documents filed in the
case, and according to other lawyers, he made no courtroom
appearances during that time.
</P>
<P>
   Morales told the Houston Chronicle earlier this month that Murr
did most of his work behind the scenes. In supporting Murr's fee
request last year, Morales told arbitrators that he consulted with
Murr ``on occasions far too numerous to count.''
</P>
<P>
   But phone records and sign-in sheets obtained by the Chronicle
indicate that Murr infrequently visited the attorney general's
office and was only occasionally called by Morales until shortly
before the settlement was reached.
</P>
<P>
   Murr, who met Morales when both were young lawyers at Houston's
Bracewell &AMP; Patterson law firm in the early 1980s, was given a 3
percent contingency contract in the tobacco case by Morales in
October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Murr's contract was revised only a few months later, in January
1997, to remove the contingency and provide only that a
``reasonable fee'' be awarded.
</P>
<P>
   After the settlement was reached, Murr agreed to submit his fees
to arbitration. He and Morales picked the three state arbitrators _
former Texas Supreme Court Justice Bob Gammage, retired state
District Judge Sol Casseb of San Antonio and former federal
District Judge James DeAnda of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Junell said the $3.3 billion paid to the other five private
lawyers was ``obscene, but they're real lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales has said he chose Murr for the tobacco case because he
had experience in negotiating damage suits for large numbers of
plaintiffs, including litigation over the 1989 Phillips Petroleum
explosion in Pasadena and defective plastic pipe used in plumbing
systems.

DUNN GETS SERIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA -- It's time for Jim Dunn to get serious. And that could
spell trouble for the rest of the Funny Car teams in the National
Hot Rod Association, which continues its 22-race tour today with
qualifying for the Checker, Schuck's, Kragen Nationals at Firebird
Raceway near Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, a former driver turned team owner/crew chief, has always
made the most out of a little, fielding a consistent top-10 team
despite a lack of major corporate sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   So one can only imagine what the La Mirada resident will do this
season with major backing from Penthouse Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past we did it for fun,'' said Dunn, who had a
limited-budget deal from Mooneyes Auto from 1993-97. ``The Mooneyes
deal was for fun. It was like the old days. Now it's time to get
serious and go after the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will have a hard-running race car, capable of
running with anyone in the top 10. We will be competitive from the
first race of the season until the last one. We plan to do our best
and win our share of races. We have a qualified team, good
equipment and a driver eager to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to Penthouse, some money as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough money and enough equipment,'' Dunn said. ``Now
we have to get out there and get our act together. The first year
we'll try to do the best we can but if you win the championship,
it's just pure luck.''
</P>
<P>
   That has worked for Dunn in the past when he tuned Kenji Okazaki
to a pair of victories in 1997, including the Big Bud Shootout, a
special event that features the top eight competitors on the
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, who retired as a driver in 1990, knows the championship
will not come overnight, but he is ready for the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the challenge, throwing more parts at it,'' said Dunn,
the father of Top Fuel driver Mike Dunn. ``I have to learn to step
up. Last year when we shut down, I went to work for Brad Anderson.
He had a pretty good sponsor, so I was able to twist the screws a
little more. So when we ran (a 4.84-second pass), that gave me a
little more confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do it if we have the money. Now we have the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Still Dunn's talent as first-rate crew chief could be the key to
the effort. And he has the driver in Frank Pedregon, who was one of
just three drivers in 1998 to win back-to-back national events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have a driver who can win races,'' said Dunn, who
also tuned Covina native Randy Anderson to a runner-up finish at
the U.S. Nationals in early September. ``There are some big drivers
who can't win races. To win a championship, you need a good driver
and a lucky driver. (John Force) wins about 20 percent of his races
on luck. That's what makes him a champion -- he's a very good
driver and he's lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedregon has already had luck shine on his side. The original
deal with Penthouse was to have Kelly Magrath drive, but the La
Jolla resident is sidelined indifinitely with a recurring eye
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great year so far,'' said Pedregon, the oldest of
three racing brothers. ``I got married New Year's Eve and couple
weeks later I'm picked to drive. We had a pretty good record last
year. There are guys who race for years and don't have a win. I
already have two. So I'm glad to be back with Jim. I'm back at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be a winning combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have gone to the opening event in Pomona last year
if I didn't think Frank could do it,'' Dunn said. ``After two wins
last season, I have confirmed my instincts. With the addition of
Penthouse Magazine, this season should be even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank wants to go racing. He's making straight runs. His
attitude is one that says `I want to do well and win races.' He is
ready for what I can throw at him. Well keep adding a little bit
each race. We think this Penthouse Magazine Funny Car is capable of
winning any race we enter. Winning an event is only a matter of
time.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ President Clinton may not have been gloating
Thursday, but he sure was celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   Indulging a former antagonist and delighting in his own economic
record, Clinton basked in bright sun and warm ovations here as he
shopped, talked baseball and promoted his proposals to preserve
Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Among the speakers welcoming the president to the convention
center was Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., who voted to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Kolbe praised Clinton's leadership on trying to make
the retirement system more secure and noted twice to the boisterous
crowd of 2,000 that he had flown in with the president on Air Force
One. He sat down beside Clinton, leaning toward him and whispering.
</P>
<P>
   In his own remarks, Clinton thanked Kolbe _ perhaps generously,
perhaps pointedly _ for ``crossing district and party lines to be
here with us today.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked later if he still believed Clinton was unfit for office,
Kolbe paused and then said: ``The impeachment's over. Let's talk
about Social Security here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe also has proposed detailed repairs to the Social Security
system, and aides to Clinton insisted that he was fond of the
congressman and harbored no grudge.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was so sunny in his own remarks that he converted even
his bad news to good. The fact that Social Security and Medicare
were in trouble, he said, was ``a high-class problem'' _ evidence
that medical care and prosperity were letting people live longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing to wring your hands about,'' he said. But, he
added, ``we have a responsibility to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was in such a generous mood that he skipped right over a
dig at Republicans' tax cut plans prepared by his speechwriters and
released to the press before he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton and Kolbe may be trying to put impeachment behind
them _ at least in public _ the same could not be said of the few
dozen protesters outside clamoring for the president's resignation
or of the Democrats inside, many of whom booed Kolbe.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the convention center, Clinton stopped at a store
to inspect some silver and turquoise jewelry and then visited the
Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team, which is in spring training. He
wandered onto the field to chat with players and to collect a
jersey bearing the number one and the name Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned to fly Thursday to San Francisco, where he was
to raise about $1 million for Democrats. He is on a six-day trip
that will include three days of vacation with his family in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Several elderly people who waited said that they were confident
the politicians would find a way to protect Social Security or
Medicare. But then, in the balmy Arizona weather, they seemed to
have few complaints about anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what they call the good life, baby,'' said Herb Bloom,
84, with a slow grin.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom said he trusted Clinton to preserve the retirement
security system. ``The Republicans are sort of hanging back on it,
as usual,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also hung back Thursday. While he advocated
strengthening the retirement system by paying off the national debt
_ even envisioning a ``debt-free'' nation in 2018 _ he avoided any
talk of cutting benefits or raising taxes. He spoke vaguely of
``somewhat controversial'' decisions that policymakers would have
to make, and he urged his listeners to support their congressman as
he makes them.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' affection for Clinton seemed undimmed by the
sexual assault accusation against Clinton that had been televised
the night before on NBC. In an interview, Juanita Broaddrick, an
Arkansas woman, said that Clinton had assaulted her more than 20
years ago. Through a lawyer, Clinton has denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   People came to see the president dismissed the accusation as
unbelievable or ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Killian, a 31-year-old homemaker, noted that Ms.
Broaddrick had once signed an affidavit saying she had had no
sexual relationship with Clinton. ``She must be a liar, too,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Van Sant, a 42-year-old a pharmacist, said that she had
voted for Ross Perot, but that she had come to support Clinton over
the last year. ``After all of this fiasco, I have a lot of respect
for the man for standing up for what he believes in,'' she said.
``It shows character in a person.''

PENTAGON SAYS YUGOSLAV ARMY MASSED NEAR KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Yugoslav army has massed 4,500 heavily armored
troops on the Kosovo border, the Pentagon said Thursday,
threatening to undermine the fragile progress toward ending the
conflict there and challenging Washington to enforce an agreement
that limits Yugoslav forces in the rebellious province.
</P>
<P>
   Serb commanders have also moved 60 tanks, 50 armored personnel
carriers and 70 artillery pieces to the Kosovo frontier, in
positions that would allow a major assault on rebel fighters, the
Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know why they've moved these troops or exactly what
they plan to do with the troops that they have marshaled around the
borders of Kosovo,'' a spokesman for the Pentagon, Kenneth H.
Bacon, said.
</P>
<P>
   But another senior administration official said the buildup was
an ominous development that not only threatened to scuttle
additional peace talks between President Slobodan Milosevsic's
government and the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, but also plunge the
Clinton administration and NATO into a new crisis on dealing with a
Serb offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the provocative maneuvers, which were made in a hiatus
in the negotiations that are to resume on March 15 in France, the
administration backed off its threat to use force to enforce the
troop levels negotiated between the United States and Milosevic in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Under that accord, Milosevic agreed to reduce Yugoslav forces in
Kosovo at least to the levels of last February. That would have
meant reducing the 18,000 Yugoslav army troops who were there in
October to 12,500 and paring the 11,000 Serbian paramilitary police
officers to 6,500.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether NATO would strike if Yugoslavia poured fresh
troops into Kosovo in violation of the accord, Bacon said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We will take appropriate and necessary action to protect
people from humanitarian disasters, and we will also take any
needed action to promote peace. Beyond that, I don't want to get
into any specifics about hypothetical operations.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, he added, ``The conduct of the troops is much more
important than the numbers of the troops at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Pentagon and State Department officials acknowledged
Thursday that Belgrade had never fully complied with the original
force withdrawal. In addition, the Serbs have deployed about 70
tanks, 70 armored personnel carriers and 50 artillery pieces inside
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said more than two times those forces were in garrisons.
Administration officials said the levels also violated the October
accord.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has not publicized the violations or
threatened aerial attacks to enforce the agreement, perhaps fearing
that such strikes could wreck the peace negotiations,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what level of violations would draw a NATO response,
Under Secretary of State Thomas A. Pickering said Thursday at a
hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, ``I do not want to
draw a series of maps with red lines for the Serbs. We need to
avoid that very, very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickering said any Serb violations of the cease-fire pact
``would clearly have grave and substantial risks.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, in the hearing room and on the Senate floor,
attacked the administration's Kosovo policy. ``Our troops are very
expensive peacekeepers,'' Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the
Republican whip, said on the floor. ``I'm very concerned we're
going to be there a long, long time. I don't see an exit
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators' anger was stoked further when Under Secretary of
Defense Walter Slocombe told the committee that if the warring
parties reached an agreement, the cost of contributing 4,000
American troops to the 28,000-member NATO peacekeeping force would
be $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has already spent $10 billion to support
American forces in Bosnia since 1995, and it is budgeting $2
billion a year for that peacekeeping. Spending an additional $2
billion a year for another indefinite military mission in Kosovo
did not go over well Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, who is on the Armed Services
Committee, said: ``What we're dealing with here is another
open-ended commitment. Not to say that it doesn't merit our
commitment. But I don't think we are prepared to acknowledge the
extent to which we will have to commit thousands of men and women
from our armed forces once again, and billions more in expenditures
for an undetermined period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials responded that the Kosovo crisis
threatened stability in Europe, tested NATO credibility and could
undercut the halting progress in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   As for deadlines, President Clinton predicted three years ago
that American troops would be out of Bosnia in a year. That did not
happen, and his aides are not repeating that mistake. Instead, they
say, progress in Kosovo should be measured by milestones like when
security forces withdraw and elections are held.

 &HT;    King curses family of fatal dragging victim after death sentence
levied
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ John William ``Bill'' King's last public act in
Jasper was to curse the family of his murder victim as he was led
away to become the only white person on death row in Texas for
killing a black person.
</P>
<P>
   A Jasper County jury took just less than three hours to hand
King a death sentence for the torture and killing of James Byrd
Jr., who last June was dragged behind a pickup truck until his body
was torn apart.
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, did not react when State District Judge Joe Bob Golden
read the death sentence. He released a hand-written statement that
proclaimed his innocence and declared he was ``determined to die
proudly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he is,'' said Joe Collins, the foreman and only black
person on the jury of seven men and five women. ``He's in a place
where he's going to.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins and another juror, Lequeta Flowers, spoke on behalf of
the panel. They said the jury tried to find a redeeming quality in
King but could only conclude that he was without remorse, full of
hate and capable of killing again.
</P>
<P>
   ``No crime of this nature is acceptable in any situation,''
Flowers said. ``Society just cannot accept this.''
</P>
<P>
   As King left the courthouse, reporters asked him if he had a
message for the Byrd family. He tossed off an obscenity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just sums up the total personality of this young man,''
said Mary Verrett, one of Byrd's six sisters. ``He has no remorse,
even in the face of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Byrd family, who attended the entire eight-day
trial, declined to address King in the courtroom when it was time
for victims to speak after the sentence was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just happy,'' the victim's daughter, Renee Mullins, said
later. ``They did what they should have done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a closure, but the anger's still going to be with
us because of the way he died,'' said Stella Brumley, a sister of
Byrd's.
</P>
<P>
   The Jasper community has openly shared the hurt of the Byrd
family since the June 7 murder that was so gruesome it rocked the
nation _ and the world. Seeing King sent to the execution chamber
as punishment for the shocking crime appeared to relieve many local
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to ease the pain here,'' said Booker T.
Hunter, president of the Jasper chapter of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People. ``They got justice. That's
what they were looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Clark, special agent in charge of the Houston FBI office,
said, ``The people of Jasper County, Texas stood up and spoke to
the world and said, `This is what justice is all about. This is
what America is all about.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County officials have not yet decided whether to put
King's two co-defendants on trial in Jasper, an economically
depressed logging town of 8,000. The county had to raise property
taxes and rely on government grants to help pay for King's trial
and the upcoming trials of his white co-defendants, Shawn Allen
Berry, 24, and Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31. The cost of all three
trials is estimated at $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   King's disabled father was not in the courtroom when his son was
sentenced to death. Ronald King, a retired lumber worker, listened
to the 35-minute closing arguments and then had a 20-minute private
visit with his son, whom he adopted as a three-month-old baby. The
two men cried and hugged in a small room adjacent to the courtroom
while the jury deliberated.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the last time he'll ever touch his daddy again,'' said
defense lawyer C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs Jr. ``Ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder King released a written statement asking for prayers
for the Byrd family, for his son, for the jurors and ``for the town
of Jasper, a community that remains strong though scarred by this
unspeakable act.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that we all can find meaning from this tragedy, from
the needless and senseless death of James Byrd Jr.,'' the statement
said. ``We all are human beings, black and white. We all are
children of God. We must learn to love one another and not hate.''
</P>
<P>
   His son becomes the first white person condemned in Texas for
killing a black person since the state resumed capital punishment
in the mid-1970s. The only white person to be executed in Texas for
killing a black person was a farmer who killed another white
farmer's favorite slave nearly 150 years ago, according to research
by a University of Florida professor published in The Sociological
Quarterly in 1989. Prosecutors told jurors in closing arguments
Thursday morning that Bill King deserved to be executed because he
was a hate-filled racist who would hurt again.
</P>
<P>
   ``By giving Mr. King a life sentence, you're giving him at least
40 years to catch a black guard, a black nurse, a black doctor, a
Jewish guard, a Jewish nurse, a Jewish doctor, or anybody else,''
said assistant district attorney Pat Hardy. Prosecutors presented
evidence that King had a homemade knife in his cell while awaiting
trial for this case. In their deliberations Thursday, jurors asked
to see the shank.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys asked for a life sentence, which would have
made King eligible for parole after 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your vote is not going to bring Mr. Byrd back; I wish it
could,'' lawyer Brack Jones Jr. said. ``Your vote is not going to
change the stigma this Jasper community is going to have for years
to come.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of whether you vote life or death, John William
King is a dead man walking.

JURY QUICKLY DECIDES ON DEATH PENALTY FOR DRAGGING DEATH DEFENDANT
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ After eight days of often-gruesome testimony, a
jury took less than three hours on Thursday to decide that John
William King must die for the dragging death of an African-American
man he didn't know but killed because of a hatred of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   He is the first white person in Texas to be sent to Death Row
for the murder of an African-American since the state revived
capital punishment in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   A defiant King, the first of three defendants to be tried in the
June 7 slaying of James Byrd Jr., responded with a crude sexual
reference when he was asked outside the courthouse if he had
anything to say to Byrd's family.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's sister Mary Verrett said she wasn't surprised by King's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't expect for him to say, `God bless the Byrd family.'
It just sums up the total personality of this young man,'' she
said. ``He has no remorse, even in the face of death.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two rows of the Victorian courtroom in the small East
Texas town were filled by relatives of Byrd, 49, a vacuum cleaner
salesman who was walking home after attending two parties.
Prosecutors said he was picked up by King and two friends who took
him to a country road, beat him, sprayed his face black, chained
his ankles to a pickup bumper and dragged him three miles along a
rural road. His decapitated body was dumped at a black cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for the trials of the other two defendants,
Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, and Shawn Berry, 24.
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing of King is ``one point of closure but the pain is
still with us,'' said Stella Brumley, a sister of Byrd. ``It's not
going to bring back our brother, but now another family won't have
to go through this devil's station of agony. Justice has worked.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendant's father, Ronald King, 67, who on Wednesday
pleaded with the jury to spare his son's life, was too ill to
attend court yesterday but issued a statement in anticipation of a
death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to pray for healing and reconciliation,'' he wrote.
``Please pray for the Byrd family, who have endured unimaginable
pain and loss. Please pray for these jurors who shouldered a
horrible burden. Please pray for our town of Jasper, a community
that remains strong though scarred by this unspeakable act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also ask for prayers for my family, and for my son, for
redemption and healing even on death row,'' Ronald King wrote. ``I
hope we can find some meaning from this tragedy, from the needless
and senseless death of James Byrd Jr. We are all human beings,
black and white. We are all children of God. We must learn to love
one another and not hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush issued a statement commending the jury ``for
its hard work and its verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The brutal beating, dragging and murder of James Byrd was a
horrible, despicable crime, and those responsible deserve the
ultimate punishment,'' Bush said. ``The jury has sent a clear
message that Texas will not tolerate hate and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, King was escorted in a bullet proof vest to
an unmarked car that whisked him to the prison system's James Byrd
Diagnostic Center in Huntsville, which was named for a former
warden who is no relation to the victim. After medical and
psychological examinations, he will be placed on Death Row.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement issued through his attorney, King said,
``Though I remain adamant about my innocence, it's been obvious
from the beginning that the community would get what they desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I'll close with the words of Francis Yockey,'' he wrote.
```The promise of success is with the man who is determined to die
proudly when it is no longer possible to live proudly. ...'''
</P>
<P>
   As the jury foreman and only black member of the jury, Joe
Collins, a prison guard and former classmate of King, announced
that a verdict had been reached in the punishment phase. When
Collins was told later of King's intention to ``die proudly,'' he
said: ``I hope he is. He's going to a place where he's going to.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Billy Rowles, who arrested the three suspects in less
than 24 hours, said King was up most of Wednesday night, throwing a
tantrum and speaking threateningly to the black officer who guarded
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He nutted up, cussing, kicking the door,'' Rowles said of
King, who on Tuesday had been found guilty of capital murder.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments during the penalty phase of the trial on
Thursday, defense attorney C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs argued that
King's guilt was mitigated by his experience when he served in the
Texas prison system previously.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't a racist when he went in,'' Cribbs said. ``He was
when he came out.''
</P>
<P>
   King's other attorney, Brack Jones, said that executing King
would ``not bring Mr. Byrd back and you're not going to change the
stigma that this Jasper community is going to have for years to
come. Nothing but time will heal that.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution argued that even in maximum security, King still
poses a threat.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Guy James Gray said that King would become a
white supremacist cell block leader, and able to recruit others to
his racist cause. Then, ``he'll send as many missionaries out as he
can to do his work.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most emotional appeals to the jury, Assistant
District Attorney Pat Hardy referred to the victim's son, an Army
soldier, when he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like Ross Byrd would like nothing better that to stick
his fist into King's chest and rip out his satanic heart for what
he did to his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy noted that King was able to fashion a homemade knife from
television parts while locked in the Jasper County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give him life in prison, you are giving him 40 years to
catch a black guard, a black nurse, a black doctor _ a Jewish
guard, a Jewish nurse, a Jewish doctor,'' Hardy said. ``You are
giving him a chance to take another life.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gray contended during the trial that King killed Byrd
either to help launch a hate group in Jasper or to carry out an
initiation rite for his prison gang, the Confederate Knights of
America, jurors said they relied solely on physical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to find something to save him,'' said juror Luquita
Flowers, 41, a schoolteacher from nearby Buna. But, she said, ``I
feel like he didn't feel any remorse for his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Flowers said, the jury was of one mind about King's
guilt and his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any dissension, never a situation where one
person had to be persuaded,'' she said.

TEXAS DEATH SENTENCE FIRST IN TWO DECADES FOR WHITE KILLING A
BLACK

<TEXT>
<P>
   Thursday's sentencing of John William King marks the first time
in two decades that Texas has sent a white to Death Row for killing
a black, prompting several death penalty experts to say the
punishment is not even-handed.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, 41 black prisoners have been executed in
Texas for killing a white person _ including one execution earlier
this week, said Tonya McClary, criminal justice research director
for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in New York City. Norman Evans
Green, a black man, was executed Wednesday for killing a store
clerk in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Racial discrimination is partly to blame for the disparity, but
balancing the numbers is not the solution, McClary said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying we want them to send more white people to
Death Row for killing black people,'' said McClary, whose
organization opposes the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Discrimination based on skin color is not the only factor that
makes capital punishment unfair, McClary said. She said the poor
and uneducated, regardless of race, are more likely to be executed,
while ``someone of stature can escape the ultimate punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   O.J. Simpson, a black man and former professional football star
who was acquitted in California of murdering his white wife, is a
prime example of how money and fame can save someone from the death
penalty, McClary said.
</P>
<P>
   King was sentenced to death on Thursday for the killing of James
Byrd Jr., a black man who was dragged by a chain. If King's
punishment is carried out, he will be the first white man in Texas
this century to die for killing a black person.
</P>
<P>
   Only one white man has ever been executed in Texas for killing a
black man, and that was on June 2, 1854, said Michael Radelet, a
death penalty expert and chairman of the sociology department of
the University of Florida. That case involved a feud between two
powerful farmers that peaked when one of them killed the other's
slave, Radelet said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question the death penalty in the United States has
involved a history of racism in its worst sort,'' he said, adding
that ``evidence of racism'' continues to exist in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Capital punishment resumed in the United States in 1977. Since
then, 11 whites have been executed for killing a black, while 142
blacks have been sent to death chambers for killing a white,
according to records compiled by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 executions involving white inmates, five occurred in
South Carolina, two in Oklahoma and one each in North Carolina,
Missouri, Alabama and Virginia, the NAACP said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Todd, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal
Justice, said King will be isolated from other Death Row inmates
because of the nature of his crime. He will remain alone in a cell
23 hours a day, allowed only one hour for recreation _ also in
isolation, Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will shower alone, and he will not have any type of
communication or relationship with any of the other inmates, other
than hollering down the cell blocks,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting King, there are 452 inmates on Death Row, including
161 white men, 188 black men, 91 Hispanic men, 5 white women and
three black women. Four Death Row inmates are classified as being
something ``other'' than white, black or Hispanic, Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small percentage of homicides in Texas involves white
perpetrators and black victims, or vice versa, according to
statistics compiled by the FBI. Between 1980 and 1997, 57 percent
of the state's cases involved ``white-on-white'' killings, 31
percent were ``black-on-black'' homicides, 6 percent involved black
assailants and white victims, and 3 percent involved black victims
and white assailants, the statistics show.

JURY QUICKLY DECIDES ON DEATH PENALTY FOR DRAGGING DEATH DEFENDANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ After eight days of often-gruesome testimony, a
jury took less than three hours on Thursday to decide that John
William King must die for the dragging death of an African-American
man he didn't know but killed because of a hatred of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   He is the first white person in Texas to be sent to Death Row
for the murder of an African-American since the state revived
capital punishment in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   A defiant King, the first of three defendants to be tried in the
June 7 slaying of James Byrd Jr., responded with a crude sexual
reference when he was asked outside the courthouse if he had
anything to say to Byrd's family.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's sister Mary Verrett said she wasn't surprised by King's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't expect for him to say, `God bless the Byrd family.'
It just sums up the total personality of this young man,'' she
said. ``He has no remorse, even in the face of death.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two rows of the Victorian courtroom in the small East
Texas town were filled by relatives of Byrd, 49, a vacuum cleaner
salesman who was walking home after attending two parties.
Prosecutors said he was picked up by King and two friends who took
him to a country road, beat him, sprayed his face black, chained
his ankles to a pickup bumper and dragged him three miles along a
rural road. His decapitated body was dumped at a black cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for the trials of the other two defendants,
Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, and Shawn Berry, 24.
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing of King is ``one point of closure but the pain is
still with us,'' said Stella Brumley, a sister of Byrd. ``It's not
going to bring back our brother, but now another family won't have
to go through this devil's station of agony. Justice has worked.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendant's father, Ronald King, 67, who on Wednesday
pleaded with the jury to spare his son's life, was too ill to
attend court yesterday but issued a statement in anticipation of a
death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to pray for healing and reconciliation,'' he wrote.
``Please pray for the Byrd family, who have endured unimaginable
pain and loss. Please pray for these jurors who shouldered a
horrible burden. Please pray for our town of Jasper, a community
that remains strong though scarred by this unspeakable act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also ask for prayers for my family, and for my son, for
redemption and healing even on death row,'' Ronald King wrote. ``I
hope we can find some meaning from this tragedy, from the needless
and senseless death of James Byrd Jr. We are all human beings,
black and white. We are all children of God. We must learn to love
one another and not hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush issued a statement commending the jury ``for
its hard work and its verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The brutal beating, dragging and murder of James Byrd was a
horrible, despicable crime, and those responsible deserve the
ultimate punishment,'' Bush said. ``The jury has sent a clear
message that Texas will not tolerate hate and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, King was escorted in a bullet proof vest to
an unmarked car that whisked him to the prison system's James Byrd
Diagnostic Center in Huntsville, which was named for a former
warden who is no relation to the victim. After medical and
psychological examinations, he will be placed on Death Row.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement issued through his attorney, King said,
``Though I remain adamant about my innocence, it's been obvious
from the beginning that the community would get what they desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I'll close with the words of Francis Yockey,'' he wrote.
```The promise of success is with the man who is determined to die
proudly when it is no longer possible to live proudly. ...'''
</P>
<P>
   As the jury foreman and only black member of the jury, Joe
Collins, a prison guard and former classmate of King, announced
that a verdict had been reached in the punishment phase. When
Collins was told later of King's intention to ``die proudly,'' he
said: ``I hope he is. He's going to a place where he's going to.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Billy Rowles, who arrested the three suspects in less
than 24 hours, said King was up most of Wednesday night, throwing a
tantrum and speaking threateningly to the black officer who guarded
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He nutted up, cussing, kicking the door,'' Rowles said of
King, who on Tuesday had been found guilty of capital murder.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments during the penalty phase of the trial on
Thursday, defense attorney C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs argued that
King's guilt was mitigated by his experience when he served in the
Texas prison system previously.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't a racist when he went in,'' Cribbs said. ``He was
when he came out.''
</P>
<P>
   King's other attorney, Brack Jones, said that executing King
would ``not bring Mr. Byrd back and you're not going to change the
stigma that this Jasper community is going to have for years to
come. Nothing but time will heal that.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution argued that even in maximum security, King still
poses a threat.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Guy James Gray said that King would become a
white supremacist cell block leader, and able to recruit others to
his racist cause. Then, ``he'll send as many missionaries out as he
can to do his work.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most emotional appeals to the jury, Assistant
District Attorney Pat Hardy referred to the victim's son, an Army
soldier, when he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like Ross Byrd would like nothing better that to stick
his fist into King's chest and rip out his satanic heart for what
he did to his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy noted that King was able to fashion a homemade knife from
television parts while locked in the Jasper County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give him life in prison, you are giving him 40 years to
catch a black guard, a black nurse, a black doctor _ a Jewish
guard, a Jewish nurse, a Jewish doctor,'' Hardy said. ``You are
giving him a chance to take another life.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gray contended during the trial that King killed Byrd
either to help launch a hate group in Jasper or to carry out an
initiation rite for his prison gang, the Confederate Knights of
America, jurors said they relied solely on physical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to find something to save him,'' said juror Luquita
Flowers, 41, a schoolteacher from nearby Buna. But, she said, ``I
feel like he didn't feel any remorse for his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Flowers said, the jury was of one mind about King's
guilt and his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any dissension, never a situation where one
person had to be persuaded,'' she said.

NETWORKS LEAD WAY IN POST-IMPEACHMENT SCANDAL COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With President Clinton's acquittal on impeachment
charges, round-the-clock television news scrutiny of his personal
life began to subside, to the relief of many a viewer. But the
ebbing of Clnton-Lewinsky mania has clearly hurt the 24-hour cable
news networks, whose ratings had been pumped up by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In the week after the acquittal, each of the three main cable
news networks _ CNN, MSNBC and Fox News Channel _ saw their Nielsen
ratings drop, by 25 to 30 percent, from the average they had been
getting during the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   And the latest coups in television coverage have been by the
major broadcast networks _ NBC News with an interview with Juanita
Broaddrick, the Arkansas businesswoman who accused Clinton of
raping her 21 years ago, and ABC News with Barbara Walters'
interview with Monica Lewinsky, scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, ``Dateline NBC'' got a ratings spike from
the interview by the correspondent Lisa Myers with Mrs. Broaddrick.
Up against the Grammy Awards show on CBS, ``Dateline'' got a 10.3
rating for its first half-hour, representing about 10.2 million
households, about 10 percent more than average.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's sister cable channel, MSNBC, also got a slight boost on
Wednesday night for related shows. Brian Williams interviewed Ms.
Myers live on his 9 p.m. newscast, and at 10 p.m., she was
interviewed by John Hockenberry during ``Hockenberry,'' his
interview show.
</P>
<P>
   The next big exclusive is Ms. Walters' two-hour special next
Wednesday, for which ABC has raised its price for a 30-second
commercial to $800,000 from the usual $160,000.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is some concern about whether that interview will
deliver the audience being paid for, because some elements of what
Ms. Lewinsky told Ms. Walters were reported Thursday in The
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're far more concerned that information like this can be
leaked to the press without our authorization and without being
accurate,'' Eileen Murphy, the spokeswoman for ABC News, said
Thursday. ``There are several inaccuracies in what was printed, and
that's of more concern than what it might do to the ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Post's account was reported on CNN's morning news Thursday,
and the reporter, Howard Kurtz, was interviewed on CNN's 5 p.m.
program, ``Inside Politics.'' His report got brief mention on Fox
News Channel's 6 p.m. news Thursday night, and on ``Equal Time'' on
MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most unusual plan for capitalizing on interest in
Ms. Lewinsky's story comes from the producers of MSNBC's
``Hockenberry.'' Conceding that most viewers will tune to Ms.
Walter's interview, MSNBC is running promotional ads urging viewers
to simultaneously log on to MSNBC's Web site, or to watch both ABC
and MSNBC using the picture-within-a-picture gadgetry if they have
it, and then to send their reactions to MSNBC, by telephone or by
e-mail, which will then be read on the air.

<P>
   GLAMIS, Calif. _ Alan Hamada chuckled as a bucket's worth of
sand landed in his face.
</P>
<P>
   He laughed harder when another load hit him, pouring onto his
lap and seeping into his jeans, socks and high-tops. ``Ha,'' he
said, ``I got used to that a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Very little can get in the way of Hamada's good time when he
rides his dune buggy on the undulating sands of the California
desert. Not the deafening roar of thousands of other dune buggies
and assorted fat-wheeled vehicles (``it's music''), not the burning
sun (``just beautiful''), not the many accidents (``I'm careful''),
and definitely not all the sand that slaps him when riled by his
buggy (``part of the fun!'').
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the experience for Hamada, a Los Angeles
sheet-metal worker who travels 270 miles, near the Arizona line,
just to play road warrior. Officially, his playpen, which is
overseen by the Bureau of Land Management, is known as the Imperial
San Dunes Recreation Area. But to most people who come here, the
125,000 acres of dunes that they joy ride in is simply ``Glamis,''
the sand-toy capital of the world.
</P>
<P>
   During the big holiday weekends from Thanksgiving to Easter _
and usually the weekends immediately around those holidays _ the
dunes draw 40,000 to 60,000 sand fans to an outpost where the
permanent population is 13. So many trailers line the desert road
that Glamis becomes a weekend city, complete with different
neighborhoods, grandmothers in lawn chairs and dogs tied to the
trailers' doors.
</P>
<P>
   The off-roaders are a decades-old tradition, but they are not
entirely welcome. In the nearest city, Brawley (population 20,000),
which is 25 miles west of Glamis, residents brace for the Glamis
crowd the way coastal towns brace for a hurricane. They either
clear out or stay in, and the local hospital, Pioneers Memorial,
stocks up on staff members and supplies to handle the inevitable
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Glamis weekend it's total chaos,'' said Jennifer Smith,
manager of the Townhouse Hotel in Brawley, as she watched the
flatbed trucks carrying dune buggies and motorcycles pass by on the
Saturday of Presidents' Day weekend. ``Cars speed through town like
they're in a race, and you hear ambulance sirens day and night.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have a complaint, too _ that the motorcycles,
all-terrain vehicles, dune buggies and other machines that tear
through the sand are literally tearing up the fragile desert,
scarring it for decades and destroying unique animal and plant
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The off-road vehicles are probably the single most destructive
force in the California desert,'' said Nick Ervin, who is active in
the Sierra Club in San Diego and is a member of the federal
California Desert Advisory Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, largely because of environmental concerns,
off-roaders have been restricted to 12 areas in the 25-million-acre
desert. And off-roaders, who must be licensed and registered by the
state, contend that they have been restricted enough.
</P>
<P>
   Hamada, who started riding 30 years ago and still comes six or
seven weekends a year, considers the desert remarkably resilient.
</P>
<P>
   ``One sandstorm will wipe this all away,'' he said as he
surveyed the maze of tire treads on the dunes.
</P>
<P>
   Hamada's son, Neil, 27, began riding on a motorcycle with his
father when he was 2, and on his own, on a motorized baby-sized
buggy, when he was 4, like so many other children here. He is now
the dunes manager, the lone ranger in residence at the Cahuilla
Ranger Station in Glamis.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Hamada bristles at the reputation of the off-roaders, which
is that of a beer-guzzling fraternity that howls at the moon. In
truth, they are a varied group. There are people who fly
Confederate battle flags on their trailers and belong to a Glamis
paramilitary group that curses the government and advertises coming
off-road events on the Internet. There are also average suburban
families, serious off-road clubs that spend the weekend in
organized races up a 300-foot-high dune called Oldsmobile Hill, and
yuppies trying out their new SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   Too many off-roaders believe that falling in the dunes will be
like landing in several feet of new snow. Instead, the sand might
as well be marble. When people fall, lips split, arms and legs
break, ribs snap and skulls crack. Each year, several people die
and several hundred others are seriously injured on the dunes,
usually because someone was driving too fast or drinking too hard.
</P>
<P>
   On Presidents' Day weekend, when more than 40,000 people
converged in the dunes, Pioneers Memorial Hospital tallied 71
serious injuries, including four sheared spleens, a punctured
liver, a broken neck, a broken leg that had to be amputated, and
many fractured legs, clavicles and arms.
</P>
<P>
   Hamada was riding his dune buggy without a helmet, a no-no, but
he wore goggles and a blue kerchief over his nose and mouth as a
shield. He has never broken any bones, he said, but has had an
uncountable number of bruises and cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young, I got hurt riding a motorcycle many times,''
he said. ``But then, when you're young, you do a lot of stupid
things.''
</P>
<P>
   He was driving only 35 miles an hour, though it felt much
faster. The wind was whipping and the motor sounded like a small
plane as Hamada drove around and around in a sand pit, thoroughly
enjoying himself.

 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Who are all these 43.4 million Americans, at the
Census Bureau's last count, who do not have health insurance? Who
runs the least risk in going without it? (Children.) Who runs the
most risk? (Sick people approaching 65.) Who is most likely to have
it? (People over 65.) Not to have it? (Adults who work for low
wages.) Who doesn't care? (Invincible youth.)
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, a average of a million Americans a year
have either lost their health insurance or failed to obtain
insurance for which they became eligible. The reasons vary:
prohibitive premiums, reduced employer coverage, the welfare
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the causes, the unrelenting growth in the number of
uninsured is taking a toll. Studies show that the uninsured, in
typically forgoing care until they need a hospital emergency room,
wind up far less healthy than the rest of the population. Further,
emergency rooms cannot provide them follow-up care, and treatment
there is much more costly than preventive services in a doctor's
office, adding to the burdens on the nation's health care system.
</P>
<P>
   The vast number of uninsured is a startling anomaly in an
economy that has been able to subdue inflation, unemployment and
budget deficits. Much to the dismay of advocates for the uninsured,
the United States, despite its bounty, stands almost alone among
industrial nations in not providing free basic health care for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number is going in absolutely the wrong direction,'' said
Grace-Marie Arnett, president of the conservative Galen Institute,
a health and tax policy organization. ``It shows something is wrong
with the system.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the rise in the cost of insurance and health care
outrunning wages gains, said Paul Fronstin, an analyst at the
nonpartisan Employee Benefit Research Institute, ``this is going to
get worse unless something is done about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The what to do about it _ long primarily the concern of liberals
_ is now being weighed by politicians across the political
spectrum. The still-evolving proposals range from expanding
government insurance programs to tax breaks helping more people buy
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general,'' said Judith Feder, dean of policy studies at the
Georgetown University Public Policy Institute, ``there is
acknowledgment across ideological and partisan lines that the
reason people don't have coverage is they can't afford it and that
the way to provide it is through subsidies. Then the question is
how the subsidies are to be given and whether to focus on
particular populations.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is debate on how to help them, few experts disagree
on who they are.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, not many are elderly or seriously disabled
because Medicare covers most of them.
</P>
<P>
   Another group, some five million to six million have family
incomes exceeding $75,000 a year and can usually afford the
insurance that they forgo for a number of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 11 million are children, from indigent to well off. But
to many health system analysts, children raise less-compelling
concerns than large numbers of the other uninsured. First, they are
generally healthier than adults and cheaper to treat.
</P>
<P>
   And second, alone among the uninsured, they have already been
singled out for help, under a $24 billion, five-year program for
non-Medicaid eligible children that was approved by Congress in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the rest of the uninsured, those who need coverage
most: 25 million to 30 million people who have the greatest chance
of becoming ill and who cannot pay for care when they do.
Demographically, they run the gamut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some work, and some don't,'' said Katherine Swartz, an
associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. ``Some
don't work because they're sick. Some are very young adults not
covered by their parents' health insurance. They take jobs serving
latte in coffee shops that are not likely to have health insurance.
They just don't think about the risks.''
</P>
<P>
   The income of some is so low that they cannot afford to buy
insurance, Ms. Swartz said, but not so low that they qualify for
Medicaid. Others may qualify but fail to apply, because of
ignorance, language barriers or a general sense of intimidation. So
they rely on emergency rooms for all their care.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the uninsured in the greatest need of coverage ``are
working adults who are not quite in the middle class,'' said David
B. Kendall, health policy analyst at the Progressive Policy
Institute. ``They are the folks who don't have a job that's going
to be there for a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Minority groups account for a disproportionate number of the
uninsured, Kendall said. Among Hispanic Americans, nearly half of
those under 65 are uninsured; the Hispanic category makes up only
11 percent of the population but 21 percent of all the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say there are several reasons, some of which reflect a
conscious choice to forgo insurance: Hispanic people who have
immigrated to the United States tend to be healthy and to value
self-reliance. They may also be intimidated by language and
cultural barriers from applying for Medicaid and other assistance.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The travails of the uninsured are often dismissed because the
law assures them the last-resort, safety-net care of emergency
rooms, says Drew E. Altman, president of the Kaiser Family
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time they call the ambulance, many have gone without
the preventive care that might have averted the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of adults under 65 by Kaiser and the Commonwealth Fund
found that in a single year, 24 percent of the uninsured declined
to fill a prescription that had been given to them by a doctor,
compared with 6 percent of those who had insurance. Fifty-one
percent had difficulty obtaining care compared with 10 percent of
the insured, and 42 percent never saw a doctor during the prior
year, compared with 17 percent for the insured.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the uninsured are sicker than others, according to
a study last year by the Center for Studying Health System Change,
a research group supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
The study found that 16.3 percent of uninsured people under 65 were
in fair to poor health, compared with 10.6 percent of all people
under 65.
</P>
<P>
   ``The uninsured use less care,'' said John Holahan, health
policy analyst at the Urban Institute. ``When they do get care,
they get less of it.''
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for the rise in the uninsured is the shift of
people from welfare to work. More than six million have left the
welfare rolls in the last five years, many for low-wage jobs that
do not offer any insurance or that charge a lot for it.
</P>
<P>
   For these workers, there is help for a while from Medicaid, the
federal-state insurance program for the poor, which is
automatically granted welfare recipients. In most states, families
can remain on Medicaid for a year after leaving the cash-assistance
rolls.
</P>
<P>
   But then, said Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families
USA, a consumer advocacy group, ``their reward is the loss of
health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the swelling in the number is the rising cost
of health care _ for hospital stays, physician visits and
prescription medicine. It is climbing faster than workers' wages,
and on top of the general increase in the cost of care, employers
are asking workers to a larger share of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, nearly two-thirds of all businesses with 100 or more
workers paid the full cost of an individual worker's care, a Kaiser
Family Foundation study says. A decade later only a third did so.
Kaiser says employers that ask workers to pay part of the cost
through payroll deductions raised the workers' share from 13
percent in 1988 to 22 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a survey by the federal Agency for Health Care
Policy and Research found, one in four workers who were offered
employer-subsidized insurance in 1997 declined to sign up. A decade
ago, only one in ten declined.
</P>
<P>
   These changes, analysts say, have spawned the largest segment of
the uninsured, the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   In a study this month of the uninsured in 1997, the Center for
Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group in
Washington, reported that nearly half the nation's 4.5 million
working parents with incomes below the federal poverty line _
$13,650 for a family of three _ were uninsured. And of the 15.8
million who made up to twice the poverty wage, or $27,300 for
three, it said a third were uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Young adults, some poor, some not, represent another large group
of the uninsured. Of 65 million people up to 34 years old, nearly
25 percent are uninsured, compared with 13 percent of the rest of
the population, and they represent nearly 40 percent of all the
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Of the youngest among them, those 19 to 24, the Center for
Studying Health System Change says 30 percent are not offered
insurance through their jobs. Of those who are offered it,
typically for a few hundred dollars a year, 30 percent turn it
down.
</P>
<P>
   Some who reject it are working poor and cannot afford it.
Others, feeling immortal, use their wages for something else. But
in forgoing regular care, the youngest appear to pay a toll as they
age. The center reports that nearly 18 percent of the uninsured
aged 25 to 34 are in fair to poor health, compared with 10 percent
for all people their age.
</P>
<P>
   However much some young adults feel they can do without
insurance, the nation has an incentive to help them buy it,
analysts say. Like safe drivers who never have accidents and still
buy car insurance, young adults' health insurance premiums help
defray the cost of care for people who are frailer and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we need these people for cross-subsidies?'' asked Fronstin
of the Employee Benefit Research Institute. ``Or should we wait
until they get sick or have an accident?
</P>
<P>
   While many analysts may have arrived at an answer, he said,
Congress has not.
</P>
<P>
   Among the beneficiaries of cross-subsidies would be a less
obviously needy group of the uninsured: the poorer and sicker,
often retired and homebound, among the 23 million Americans aged 55
to 64 who are not yet eligible for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center for Studying Health System Change,
people in that age group have average family incomes of $45,800,
about $4,000 more than the average for all families and enough to
permit nearly 90 percent of them to pay the age group's high
premiums of close to $3,000 a year, even if the employer pays no
share.
</P>
<P>
   But the 3 million among them who are uninsured earn an average
of only $18,000. The center reports that one third of them are in
particularly perilous straits. These 1 million are in ill health
and have average incomes of just $9,600, which puts private
coverage far out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   This year, President Clinton has revived a proposal he made last
year to allow people aged 55 to 64 the option of joining Medicare
by paying $300 to $400 a month until they are 65. But at $400 a
month, the one third in peril would be spending half their incomes
for health insurance.

EDITORIAL: DRUG BENEFITS IN MEDICARE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   As a bipartisan commission wrestles with restructuring Medicare
financing for the next century, it needs to modernize Medicare's
benefits. That means adding a prescription drug benefit to the
program. Liberal Democrats in Congress and on the commission
consider a drug benefit crucial to Medicare reform. But Republicans
are worried that expanding coverage to drugs could add upward of
$20 billion a year in costs to a program already headed for
insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   The political reality is that neither camp can achieve what it
wants without the other. The commission is considering a plan
drafted by Sen. John Breaux, the group's chairman, that would
replace the existing Medicare system with a market of private and
government-run health plans. The hope is that competition will help
control growth in Medicare costs over time.
</P>
<P>
   But radical restructuring will be a hard sell politically
without adding drug coverage. Conversely, it is unlikely that the
federal government can afford to cover drugs without making
substantial changes to traditional Medicare, including injecting
more managed care into the system.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which was supposed to produce final
recommendations for Congress next Monday, is now expected to work
past that date. Two swing votes on the commission, Stuart Altman, a
professor at Brandeis University, and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the
former chief economic adviser to President Clinton, have both said
they cannot support the restructuring plan without a new drug
benefit. They have good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drugs are more important therapeutically than ever.
New drugs can save money overall by keeping patients out of the
hospital. When Medicare was created in the 1960s, prescription drug
coverage was not a standard feature of private insurance policies.
Now most employer-based health plans provide drug coverage because
drugs have become an integral part of modern health care. Medicare
has never caught up.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of Medicare beneficiaries have to pay for all
drugs themselves. The rest have drug benefits through plans
provided by former employers, Medigap plans they buy themselves, or
through Medicaid. But employer-paid plans are becoming more rare,
and Medigap plans that cover drugs are too costly for many
low-income retirees to afford.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for elderly patients to pay thousands of
dollars a year for drugs. Many simply go without. That situation
needs to change. The debate over the future of Medicare has focused
on ways to control costs and shore up the finances. Equally
important is revamping benefits to reflect the prescription drug
needs of the elderly population.

</P>
<P>
   SUBURBIA-FILMS (Undated) _ In the last generation suburbia has
evolved in startling ways, becoming ever more varied by race, class
and ethnicity and eluding the grasp of all but a handful of
perceptive artists and entertainers. As highbrow films like Todd
Solondz's ``Happiness'' and popular-culture phenomena like ``The
Brady Bunch'' revival peddle the same old cliches, reaping money
and praise by pandering to audiences that share their smug
presumptions, figures as disparate as the author Junot Diaz of
``Drown,'' the filmmaker Tamara Jenkins of ``Slums of Beverly
Hills'' and the comic D.L. Hughley of the television series ``The
Hughleys'' are presenting the complex portrait of suburbia circa
2000. By Samuel G. Freedman. &UR;  &LR; (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CRUEL-INTENTIONS-FILM (Los Angeles) _ It is the next logical
development in Hollywood high concept: the literary teen movie,
bringing together young people and their Cliff Notes in a way that
ends the need for all those dreary literary classics that clutter
up the high school experience. Think of the possibilities!
``Clueless II: Why Anybody Would Read Jane Austen,''``Lolita:
Summer Vacation!'' and ``I Still Don't Know What James Joyce Was
Talking About Last Summer.'' For the younger crowd there would be
the inevitable ``Ernest Hemingway Goes to Camp.'' Or just in time
for back to school ``Little Women: First Blood.'' It was just such
an impulse that gave Roger Kumble, 32, a former video store clerk,
the inspiration for ``Cruel Intentions,'' which he wrote, and later
directed, as `` `Dangerous Liaisons' in high school.'' The film
navigates the shiny surfaces of an Upper East Side world of Gothic
brownstones and even more Gothic behavior. And as with ``Dangerous
Liaisons,'' it is a place where sex is neither furtive nor fun: it
is a weapon of mass destruction. By Bruce Newman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   GIRL-POWER-FILMS (subslug) (Undated) _ ``Jawbreaker'' is the
latest in a slew of high school comedies aimed at the bulging
demographic blip of millennial teen-agers. Already we have had
``Varsity Blues'' and ``She's All That,'' each of which has gobbled
up nearly $50 million at the box office. Opening next week is
``Cruel Intentions,'' an upscale Manhattan teen version of
``Dangerous Liaisons'' that has much in common with ``Jawbreaker.''
After that come ``American Pie'' and ``Ten Things I Hate About
You.'' A cursory look at the high school movies that have opened or
are about to open might reinforce the cliche that the more things
change, the more they stay the same. Now as in the 1950s, the
decade that invented the modern teen-ager, the American teen movie
portrays high school as a brutal social and sexual testing ground
whose pecking order puts handsome jocks and pretty cheerleaders at
the top and relegates misfits, nerds and arty types to social
serfdom. By Stephen Holden. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby reviews: ``The Mineola
Twins'' and ``Captains Courageous.'' (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BERNADETTE-PETERS-THEATER (subslug) (New York) _ The woman at
the first preview was surprised. ``It's good,'' she told a friend.
``I thought I would hate it. I had dinner with some people, and
they said, `What are you seeing?' I told them `Annie Oakley' and
they said, (italics)`Why?'''(end italics) The answer to that
question is Bernadette Peters, who stars in the revival of Irving
Berlin's ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' opening on Thursday at the Marquis
Theater on Broadway. By Alex Witchel. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   WEISSLERS-THEATER (New York) _ At the front of the expansive
rehearsal studio in Greenwich Village, looking typically coiffed
and fashionable, stand Fran and Barry Weissler, the mama and papa
of the production of ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' the producers. ``Look
at all the people here,'' Ms. Weissler says, smiling. ``And
(italics)we're(end italics) paying them.'' The quip was striking
because, in the 16 years that the Weisslers have produced on
Broadway, they have earned a reputation for being _ among other
things _ cheap. The husband and wife team that started out driving
their acting company around to parochial schools in the Northeast
in a station wagon and U-Haul have, over the last several years,
presented Broadway revivals of ``Gypsy'' with Tyne Daly, ``My Fair
Lady'' with Richard Chamberlain and Melissa Errico, and ``Grease!''
with Ms. Rosie O'Donnell. By Robin Pogrebin. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LIZZIE-BORDEN-OPERA (Undated) _ The composer Jack Beeson, 78,
concedes that in the context of American contemporary music, his
opera ``Lizzie Borden,'' which had its premiere at the New York
City Opera in 1965, is probably considered musically conservative.
Despite its angst and dissonance, the score is tonally grounded,
hews often to recognizable keys, has stretches of sweet lyricism
and set-piece arias, and even incorporates a likeness of a
Protestant hymn tune and a pastiche of a Victorian parlor song.
Operagoers can judge for themselves on Saturday evening, when
``Lizzie Borden'' returns to the repertory of the company that
presented its premiere but in a new production directed by Rhoda
Levine and conducted by George Manahan. By Anthony Tommasini.
(Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL-MUSIC-SALES (Undated) _ The good news from most of the
world's major classical-music labels is that the gloom of recent
years has largely been dispelled. Granted, classics account for
only 2.3 percent of the American record market, just less than jazz
(2.5 percent), according to Soundscan, a company that tracks sales.
But the executives who run most of the major labels say their
divisions are profitable and the future is secure. The bad news is
that this profitability has been attained through a series of
bloodlettings in recent years. Staffs have been cut, artists have
been jettisoned and project lists have been pared. By Alan Kozinn.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   RELIGIOUS-MUSIC (Undated) _ If, as they say, religion is the
opium of the masses, many composers today are heavy users _ and
pushers. Not a day goes by, it begins to seem, not a blessed day,
without a new recording of new music steeped in devotion. By
Matthew Gurewitsch. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   OLD-CLASSICAL-COMPOSERS (Undated) _ Grandparents rule. There
never was a time before when American composers of classical music
were so old: Elliott Carter, Henry Brant, Milton Babbitt, George
Perle, Lou Harrison, Leon Kirchner, Ralph Shapey and Gunther
Schuller count among the most venturesome creative musicians of the
present day, all of them going strong at ages ranging down to 73.
The definition of ``young composer'' in this context has to be
someone still under 50, and so far there are not too many high
achievers among them, as a listener was reminded at the recent
Focus festival in Manhattan of the Juilliard School, ``Toward the
Millennium, Part 1.'' By Paul Griffiths. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BORIS-GODUNOV-OPERA (Undated) _ Mussorgsky, who either didn't
finish his operas or finished them twice, has always been a
yammerer's delight. His works inspire interminable discussion as to
who he really was, what he really meant, which (or whose) version
is best and why. Any review of a performance of ``Boris Godunov''
has to start with a description of just what it contains and an
evaluation of the performers' textual choices before the quality of
the performance can even be broached. A new recording by the Kirov
Opera of St. Petersburg, conducted by the indefatigable Valery
Gergiev (Philips 462 230-2; five CDs), seeks to still the yammering
by presenting both of the composer's originals _ the practically
all-male 1869 version, and the 1872 score replete with a Polish
princess and four little animal ditties for other women's voices _
in what are billed as meticulously faithful reproductions. By
Richard Taruskin. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ART-POP-MUSIC (Undated) _ When Andy Warhol began painting
Campbell's Soup cans nearly four decades ago, it wasn't long before
Pop Art became accepted as the Next Big Thing in the world of fine
arts. The newest development in a modernist tradition that had
already absorbed the shocks of Cubism, Dadaism and Abstract
Expressionism, Pop Art was quickly recognized as a movement ready
made for museum catalogues, history books and skyrocketing auction
prices. But if you turn the words Pop Art around and apply them to
music, suddenly you have a debate about cultural values and
hierarchy, about entertainment and art, that has never been fully
resolved. By Stephen Holden. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   JAZZ-CLASSICAL-MUSIC (Undated) _ Here's one you may have heard
before: Jazz is America's classical music. It's a declaration that
is always intoned with great seriousness and a touch of
argumentative pride; the intent is to grant jazz the respect it
undeniably deserves. But that formulation has always left me
skeptical, and I've come to think that it does current jazz more
harm than good. By Jon Pareles. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-INTUITION (Undated) _ My father was unusually musical, but
that's not the point. He grew up in an America whose pop tunes, the
music he and his friends imbibed as youths, were often highly
sophisticated pieces of work. (My mother is from a musical culture,
too, but that's another story; she's Viennese.) My father's
generation, raised on Berlin, Gershwin, Porter and Kern, developed
a harmonic acuity, a suppleness of ear, that mine lacks. I grew up
on the three chords of rock-and-roll, on Phil Spector, Bob Dylan
and the Rolling Stones (and the Beatles, of course, but they were
an anomaly, their chord progressions unpredictable, their melodies
hard to harmonize to). By Tony Scherman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RADIO-CAR-TALK (Cambridge, Mass.) _ For almost 22 years, Click
and Clack, the Tappet Brothers, have been doling out belly laughs
and _ they proudly proclaim _ bad car advice on public radio's
``Car Talk.'' Their audience on 489 stations around the country is
inching dangerously close to three million listeners a week. The
series (which is heard in New York on WNYC-FM Saturday mornings at
10 and WNYC-AM Saturdays at noon) is National Public Radio's most
popular non-news show, and nobody seems to know why. By Susan
Diesenhouse. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PEACEABLE-KINGDOM-ANTIQUES (Williamsburg, Va.) _ Edward Hicks,
the early 19th century painter and Quaker minister, is a commanding
figure in American folk art. Hicks's works, especially his
``Peaceable Kingdom,'' paintings, continue to bring top prices in
the market: last month a version from 1837 was auctioned at
Christie's in New York for $4.7 million, a record for folk art. By
Rita Reif. (Moved).

EDITORIAL: UNFINISHED COLD-WAR BUSINESS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Feb. 26:
</P>
<P>
   History will judge the Clinton administration's foreign policy
record partly by its success in helping Russia reduce the nuclear
remnants of the Cold War. Nothing would do more to protect American
security in the decades ahead than insuring that Russia's immense
stockpile of nuclear weapons and materials is diminished and
adequately controlled. The modest amount of money needed to achieve
these goals now could save Washington many billions of dollars in
the future to deal with the Russian nuclear threat if it is not
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow still has 6,000 nuclear warheads poised for long-distance
delivery. Weapons-grade plutonium from dismantled warheads is
stored in poorly secured buildings, vulnerable to theft. Russia
also has tens of thousands of underpaid weapons scientists and
workers in 170 scientific institutes and 10 closed cities.
</P>
<P>
   If President Clinton hopes to leave an enduring mark in
international affairs, he will work on these problems in the
remaining 23 months of his term. Specifically, he should look for
ways to further reduce nuclear weapons and speed the conversion of
Russia's nuclear establishment to civilian activities.
</P>
<P>
   The last nuclear arms reduction treaty, negotiated more than six
years ago, has yet to be ratified by Russia's parliament. That
treaty alone would cut nuclear weapons totals nearly in half. Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov recognizes the treaty's value for Russia,
both in foreign policy and budget savings terms. Clinton should
work closely with President Boris Yeltsin and Primakov to achieve
ratification.
</P>
<P>
   But hopes for deep nuclear cuts need not depend on Russia's
Communist-dominated parliament. In coordination with Russia's
leaders, Clinton should initiate steps that go beyond the treaty,
including parallel nuclear reductions and taking more weapons off
hair-trigger alert. Such methods proved effective when tried by
Presidents George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Shrinking Russia's nuclear infrastructure also requires
expanding the cooperative programs developed under legislation
originally sponsored by Sens. Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar. These
efforts already have supported the dismantling of some 5,000
Russian warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Additional work is needed now to safely convert as much of the
plutonium and enriched uranium from these bombs into less dangerous
forms and to store what remains under much more secure conditions.
The administration rightly seeks large spending increases in these
programs in next year's budget. It is essential that Congress
approve these requests.
</P>
<P>
   Washington should also press ahead with its efforts to re-employ
Russian weapons scientists in civilian work. Two American programs
managed by the Energy Department are designed to achieve that goal.
One, begun in 1994, is aimed at Russia's scientific institutes. A
newer program deals with the closed cities. The scientific
institutes program has succeeded in re-employing thousands of
Russian scientists at home and keeping them out of the reach of
terrorists or countries eager to make nuclear, biological or
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But a report prepared for Congress this week by the General
Accounting Office called attention to some problems, including
taxation by Russia of some of the aid money and allegations that
some assistance went to institutes and scientists still engaged in
weapons work.
</P>
<P>
   However cash-starved the Russian government is, taxation of
American aid money is unacceptable. Nor should American subsidies
support Russian weapons development.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report calls for slowing down the closed-cities program
until the problems in the institutes program have been resolved.
That would be a mistake. The closed-cities agreement is more
carefully drawn than its predecessor and already provides for
exemption from Russian taxation.
</P>
<P>
   Tightened project review procedures are in place to make sure
that Washington is not inadvertently subsidizing new Russian
weapons development. These programs, along with Washington's
contributions to Russia's plutonium and uranium conversion and
security programs, should go forward as part of a coordinated drive
to substantially eliminate Russia's Cold War nuclear infrastructure
before the Clinton administration leaves office.

 &HT;    Texans juggle choice of health insurance vs. other expenses
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ All the blood drained from the boy's face. He
lay motionless on the couch, and the veins in his neck were ``going
about 90 miles an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Authenreith knew that his 5-year-old son Barry, who has a
heart condition, was in trouble on that day last December.
Authenreith works at a local engineering consulting firm that
doesn't provide health insurance, and he couldn't afford his son's
$75 medication that month. Barry had been without the medicine for
about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the boy recovered after a weeklong stay at the
hospital. Now his father isn't sure how he'll pay those hefty
medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   Many Texans face a similar predicament: Almost 500,000 Texas
children live in households that can't afford private health
insurance for their children but earn too much to qualify for
Medicaid, the federal-state health care program for the poor. So
they forego insurance and hope for the best, skipping the checkups
_ and sometimes the medications _ that could keep their kids
healthy and prevent financially disastrous major illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' soon-to-be-launched Children's Health Insurance Program
would use federal and state money to cover Texas children like
Barry Authenreith who are in that gap. But Gov. George W. Bush and
state lawmakers are still wrangling over whether the program will
cover people making up to twice the federal poverty level or only
150 percent of it.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides agree on the amount of state money to launch the
program _ an annual average of $151 million, which would come out
of the state's tobacco settlement. But they are struggling over how
far that money will go.
</P>
<P>
   The physical and budgetary health of hundreds of thousands of
Texas families hang in the balance: An estimated 220,000 Texas
children live in families with incomes between 150 percent and 200
percent of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The wage-earners in those families are legal secretaries and
mechanics, who make an average of close to $28,000 in Austin, or
175 percent of the poverty level for a four-person family. Austin
plumbers and accountants make an average of about $33,000, or twice
the poverty level for four.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Authenreith, a computer-assisted draftsman, makes a
full-time salary of about $18,000 a year, a little more than 150
percent of poverty for a family of two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any other parent, I worry about what's going to happen
next and how I'm going to handle it when it comes along,''
Authenreith said.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the 150 percent threshold say it would be fiscally
irresponsible to go any higher because future federal CHIP
contributions are uncertain, and nobody knows how many people will
enroll in the program. The federal government will put in about $3
for every $1 from Texas. Privately, some also have philosophical
objections to spending money to insure people making as much as
twice the federal poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal rules, Bush must sign off on the CHIP plan that is
sent to Washington for federal approval, and the Health and Human
Services Commission has drafted a proposal that would cover
families making up to 150 percent of the poverty level. Discussions
between the governor and lawmakers are ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the 200 percent threshold say advocates of the
lower level are overestimating the number of people who will enroll
in the program. They also note that Republican governors in other
states have chosen the higher threshold. Rep. Glen Maxey (D-Austin)
has portrayed the question as a test of Bush's professed
``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the money's available and children up to 200 percent of the
poverty level need health insurance, there's no logical reason why
we shouldn't cover them,'' Maxey said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush rejects the notion that he'd be betraying his
``compassionate'' philosophy by choosing the lower level.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can use all the kinds of slogans they want. If you get up
to 150 percent we are going to be covering a lot of children that
aren't covered today,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the debate concerns the 598,000 uninsured Texas children
who are eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled. Many families who
have left the rapidly shrinking welfare rolls mistakenly believe
that because they no longer receive welfare benefits, their
children aren't eligible for Medicaid. Others are daunted by the
Medicaid bureaucracy, or dissuaded by the stigma of getting
government help.
</P>
<P>
   Because the state will mount an aggressive outreach program as
part of CHIP, it is likely that many families will discover that
their children are eligible for Medicaid and enroll them.
Proponents of the 150 percent limit note that because no one is
sure how much Medicaid ``spillover'' there will be, the state
should concentrate on serving the poorest group.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, either CHIP option would help thousands of children.
About 24 percent of Texas' children, a total of 1.4 million, are
uninsured. The uninsured rate ranks Texas second to last behind
Arizona, and only California has more children who aren't covered.
</P>
<P>
   California's CHIP currently covers children in families making
up to twice the federal poverty level, while Arizona has adopted a
CHIP plan that will phase in the 200 percent threshold by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   For many working Texans, health insurance is still a luxury they
simply can't afford. Nearly two-thirds of uninsured children in
Texas live in households with a parent who works full-time. Only 12
percent are in families where nobody works.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, Authenreith didn't have to worry about
paying for Barry's medication or his regular visits to the
cardiologist. His wife worked for an eyeglass manufacturer that
provided health insurance for their son _ but she died in a 1997
car accident.
</P>
<P>
   After his wife's death, Authenreith quit his job in motel
maintenance _ because it took him away from home too often _ and
worked part-time and went to Austin Community College to learn
computer-assisted drafting. He was on welfare, and Barry qualified
for Medicaid. Now, he earns too much for that help _ and maybe too
much for CHIP, depending on what the final income limit is.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors tell him that Barry can have an operation when he's 10
that could correct his problem _ but Authenreith isn't even sure
how he'll pay the bills from the boy's last hospital stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude now is take things one day at a time and deal with
things the best that I can,'' he said.

STOCKS DROP SHARPLY BEFORE RECOVERING; BOND PRICES TUMBLE AGAIN  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond prices tumbled for the third consecutive session
Thursday, pushing interest rates to their highest levels since
August as reports of stronger-than-expected factory orders, jobs
and home sales gave traders little reason to suspect the pace of
economic activity is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the rout in the bond market sent stocks sharply lower
for much of the morning, but major market gauges later stabilized
and then pared most of their losses during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   By the close of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average
settled at 9,366.34, down 33.33 points. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index closed at 1,245.02, down 8.39 points, and the
Nasdaq composite index had dipped 12.56 points, to 2,326.82.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns that the pace of economic activity might be too rapid
for the Federal Reserve's taste have been the talk of the bond
market this week since the chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan,
gave his semiannual testimony on the economy to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But government reports on new factory orders and sales of
existing-home sales released Thursday supported Greenspan's
cautionary language. Both reports were much stronger than
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest rates are backing up because the economic data have
been very strong,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at
Chase Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   Fine said he was particularly unsettled by Thursday's housing
figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, housing starts to slow down before the economy starts
to slow down,'' he said. ``But we have yet to see a slowdown in
housing. It was incredibly strong in January, and the winter
weather was not conducive to that.''
</P>
<P>
   After the stock market closed, bonds received another jolt when
a Fed governor, Laurence H. Meyer, suggested that the central bank
might have to reassess its current approach to monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the Society of Business Economists in London,
Meyer questioned whether key interest rates needed to remain as low
as they were in light of continued strength in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   None of this was good news for the inflation-wary fixed-income
market.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury fell 2 points, to 94
7/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the
price, rose to 5.65 percent, from 5.51 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The early surge in bond yields pushed stock prices down sharply
during early trading. At one point during the morning, the Dow was
down more than 160 points. But buyers appeared later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised if yields went up a lot more, but bonds
are offering competition for stocks,'' said Richard E. Cripps,
chief market strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in bond yields, he said, ``is as much an unwinding of
extreme bullishness in the bond market as it is anticipation of
higher inflation, because there is no evidence of pricing
pressure'' in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   While investors may be reconsidering stocks as an investment,
there was no stampede out of equities Thursday. Trading volume on
the New York Stock Exchange was 740.5 million shares, down from
782.1 million on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks were mostly lower. Merck &AMP; Co., a Dow component,
rose 1 5/16 a share, to 80 13/16. But Bristol-Myers Squibb fell 1
9/16, to 127|. Pfizer declined 1|, to 130~. And Glaxo Wellcome lost
3/16, to 65[.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, investors pushed the price of Glaxo's American
depository receipts down by 3 percent after an advisory panel of
the Food and Drug Administration voted not to recommend approval of
the company's new influenza drug, Relenza, saying that the
treatment did not work well enough to justify approving it for sale
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Software, semiconductor and computer stocks, many trading at
high prices relative to their earnings, moved lower.
</P>
<P>
   Intel fell 2| a share, to 127}; Dell Computer dropped 1{, to
81}, and Compaq Computer declined 1 7/16, to 41.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, stocks of regional telephone companies fell after
federal regulators voted to release a report showing that large
local phone companies cannot account for more than $5 billion worth
of equipment on their books.
</P>
<P>
   The report, from the Federal Communications Commission, could
help arguments from long-distance companies that contend the local
companies overcharge them to connect their networks. The charges
are partly based on equipment costs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the regional telephone companies, Ameritech fell |, to
64~; Bell Atlantic slid ~, to 57 11/16; BellSouth declined 1 9/16,
to 46, and SBC Communications dropped 1], to 52|.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in Internet stocks seemed oblivious to the rise in
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, which on Wednesday disclosed that it owns a 46
percent stake in an online drug and cosmetic retailing company,
jumped 14 1/16 a share Thursday, to 125. And Yahoo rose 5 3/16, to
155].
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think these stocks are driven by traditional
price/earnings analysis,'' said Michael Molnar, a managing director
in retail sales and trading at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more concerned with overall industry growth rates
than they are with bond yields.''

U.S. URGED TO REDUCE ARSENAL TO REVIVE ARMS TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A coalition of nuclear-weapons experts called on
the Clinton administration Thursday to revive stalled arms-control
negotiations with Russia by making a series of bold and, if
necessary, unilateral gestures to reduce nuclear stockpiles and
build confidence.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued here, the Committee on Nuclear Policy, which
represents a variety of arms-control organizations and research
groups, said the administration was losing the initiative by
waiting indefinitely for the Russian Parliament to ratify the
second strategic arms reduction treaty, or START II, before taking
new steps to reduce nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the experts recommended, the United States and Russia
should each begin to reduce total stockpiles to 1,000 nuclear
weapons, including strategic and battlefield warheads. At the peak
of the Cold War each side had more than 10,000 warheads, but the
total number of nuclear weapons _ bombs or missiles _ has never
been made public.
</P>
<P>
   The experts, who include Robert McNamara, the former secretary
of defense, and Gen. Andrew Goodpaster, a former NATO commander,
also said both sides should take more missiles off alert and remove
from their war plans options that call for massive nuclear strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Although the committee said the United States and Russia should
work together on these objectives, it concluded that the
administration could by itself give new impetus to arms control and
reduce what the experts view as dangerous instability in Russia's
nuclear forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``To continue to rely solely on the stalemated START process is
to needlessly increase the costs and risks of maintaining U.S. and
Russian nuclear arsenals at levels well in excess of what is needed
to deter an attack,'' the committee's report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Under START I, signed in 1991, the United States and Russia have
reduced their strategic nuclear warheads from more than 10,000 to
about 6,000. START II would reduce each side's arsenal to 3,000 to
3,500 warheads. The Senate approved the treaty in 1995, but it has
languished in Russia's Parliament for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Although President Boris Yeltsin's government supports
ratification, votes have been repeatedly postponed, most recently
in the wake of December's American-led raids on Iraq, which Russia
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bell, special assistant to the president for defense
policy and arms control at the National Security Council, said the
recommendations were ``well intentioned'' but went too far. ``At
the end of the day, the proposals are too ambitious and too
idealistic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the coalition, coordinated by the Henry L. Stimson Center in
Washington, cited President Bush's sweeping, unilateral decision in
1991 to remove tactical nuclear weapons from overseas bases and
from surface ships, and to take 1,000 warheads on B-52s and some
missiles off alert. Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
quickly reciprocated, clearing the way for the START 2 agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Krepon, president of the Stimson Center, an independent
military research organization, said the administration _ and
Congress _ had not paid enough attention to the extent of the
deterioration of Russia's nuclear forces, driven by its collapsing
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll become very focused on this problem after something
terrible happens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also called on the administration to spend far
more to improve safeguards for Russia's nuclear arsenal. Clinton
has proposed increasing such spending to $4.5 billion over the next
five years, from the $2.5 billion now budgeted.

EDITORIAL: BRINGING THE DOGS TO HEEL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Feb. 26:
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to passion, few groups can compete with the animal
lobby. Members of the New York City Council still shudder at the
memory of the travails they went through over the rights of
carriage horses. Given that history, the Giuliani administration
deserves a bravery medal for its attempts to enforce the leash law
and restrict due-process rights for dogs that bite people.
</P>
<P>
   Parks Commissioner Henry Stern announced this week that he was
increasing fines for dogs caught romping off their leashes and is
stepping up enforcement of dog-control laws in Central Park and
Riverside Park. The initiative will be popular with bicyclists,
parents of small children and joggers who have been harassed by
over-friendly (or under-friendly) dogs, and a relief to park
preservationists who say the damage caused by unrestrained pets is
their worst maintenance problem.
</P>
<P>
   This outrages some dog owners, who say that human beings cause
far more damage in the parks, and that their pets are being
deprived of their natural right to run free.
</P>
<P>
   Doggie rights are also an issue in the Giuliani administration's
attempt to streamline the process for destroying vicious dogs. The
mayor has proposed a bill that would put the burden of proof on a
dog's owner to show there were extenuating circumstances when a pet
takes a chunk out of another city resident.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, even if a veterinarian finds the dog is dangerous, it
can be put down only if the city can demonstrate that the attack
was unprovoked. As a result, animals linger on the canine
equivalent of death row for months, taking space needed for other
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Both these initiatives seem reasonable. Pets are important, but
people must come first. Dogs that bite have no place in a crowded
city. Neither do dogs that are so large or hyperactive that they
cannot adjust to life on a leash. Owners have an obligation to keep
their dogs licensed and under control. If they fail to follow those
rules, they have no right to complain if they are ticketed. If a
dog attacks someone while roaming on its own, the owner will have
only himself to blame if the animal is put away.
</P>
<P>
   These rules exist to protect other animals as well as people.
Smaller dogs are the most frequent targets of unleashed dogs in the
parks, and hundreds of homeless dogs that have not bitten anyone
have to be killed every week because there is no room in the
shelters. Given scarce resources, we would keep as much space as
possible for the animals without a prior record.
</P>
<P>
   We also recommend that the mayor get behind a bill proposed by
Councilwoman Kathryn Freed that would raise license fees for
unspayed dogs and encourage the establishment of low-cost spaying
and neutering clinics. Ms. Freed contends that the vast majority of
dog bites are the work of unneutered males, and her measure could
reduce unwanted strays in the city, as well as the number of dogs
with an urge for nipping.

HAMILTON, LEFFLER TO BE BUSY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE -- Tony Stewart will not be the lone driver to be
piling up frequent flier miles this year and traveling to more than
one racing series.
</P>
<P>
   Davey Hamilton and Jason Leffler will also be pulling double
duty. Both plan on racing on Irwindale's Opening Night Spectacular
on March 27 and then fly to Phoenix to race in the IRL Phoenix 200
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Leffler will be racing the midget portion at Irwindale and
Hamilton will be in every race, midgets, sprints and the
Super-Modifieds, on opening night. Both say they plan on running
select USAC events in addition to their IRL schedule, if time
permits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This facility is like a superspeedway, except they put it in a
half-mile,'' Hamilton said during a tire-testing session last
Sunday. ``The track is perfect. It's the best short track in the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton finished second in the IRL for the second consecutive
season. He finished fourth at last year's Indianapolis 500, but has
yet to win an IRL race in 25 tries. He placed eighth at the IRL
opener Jan. 24 in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He compares the Irwindale track to Tucson and Erie, Colo., but
says those track's facilities don't compare to Irwindale.
</P>
<P>
   Leffler says the speedway surface, which he compares to
Indianapolis Racing Park, will eventually be perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real quick,'' said Leffler, who is an IRL rookie. ``This
track is in a league of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Leffler is one of only six drivers to win two USAC titles in the
same season. The Long Beach native won the Silver Crown and midget
series last year. He finished 28th in the IRL opener in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will only get better once they get some laps on it,'' said
Leffler, whose right front wheel tapped the wall when he got in the
``gray area'' and spun out in the apex of Turns 1 and 2 on Sunday.
``It's surprising that we're not sliding around.''
</P>
<P>
   Both drivers got up to about 120 mph on the track. They toured
the half-mile circuit in 15 seconds, about 3 seconds faster than
the NASCAR cars did in tire testing two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Hunt, USAC's vice president of Western States Operations,
was on hand, watching his son, Tony, test the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 18 (Western States series) races and there will be
seven events here, so I think that gives you an idea of what we
think of the facility,'' Hunt said. ``This place is a palace. It's
like comparing a local saloon against the Hollywood Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Other USAC Western States events will be held in Tucson, Madera,
Shasta, Carson City, Nev., Salt Lake City and in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Tires were a problem during Sunday's session. Every Hoosier tire
tested had blisters within 10 laps on the half-mile oval.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why they call it tire testing,'' said Glenn Howard,
whose So-Cal Performance Inc. will be supplying the Irwindale
tires.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's Super-Modified car came off the track near day's end
with the rear tires at 310 degrees and blistered. It was the
second-hardest compound brought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to have to re-group,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoosier representative Rick Gerhardt and Howard say they were
unconcerned that even the stiffest compounds were blistering. Both
say it's just a matter of getting tread down before blistering
ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't anticipate any problems by the first race,'' Gerhardt
said.
</P>
<P>
   It really wasn't very surprising that the 6,500 seats for
opening night sold out in less than 48 hours. But track general
manager Ray Wilkings says those who were shut out appeared
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been coming up to us and saying, `How come I
didn't know?''' he said. ``We've said all along that Feb. 15 was
going to be the (first) day (to buy tickets).''
</P>
<P>
   So, will those who missed out get to see the event on
television?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on it, but there are no guarantees,'' Wilkings
said. ``I've talked to people and it's wait-and-we'll-see.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkings says the track will not buy television time, which
means either an independent producer would have to line up the
advertising time and buy air time, or a network will have to decide
to do a show in its own.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary bleachers will be built in the pit area, but the seats
-- up to 1,000 -- will be available only for pit crew members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be building permament ones,'' Wilkings said. ``They
will be just to accomodate those in the pits.
</P>
<P>
   A CART championship car made its first visit to Irwindale.
</P>
<P>
   Robby Gordon wanted to test the car's gearbox on Sunday, but the
crew had trouble getting the car running, cancelling the impromptu
session.

ATHOME CUSTOMERS FRUSTRATED  &HT;     BY DEBORAH SOLOMON
</HEADLINE>
 HOME _ SF CHRON   &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In towns across the nation, users of AtHome's cable modem
service say they are frequently unable to access the Internet or
get the lightning-fast speeds the company promises.
</P>
<P>
   Customers in cities such as Portland, Ore., Nashville, Tenn.,
and Birmingham, Ala., are complaining of sluggish connections and
the inability to use the Internet service for the simplest tasks,
such as e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated users say they are angry with AtHome for not
delivering what it promised and for lax customer service. Some
users who have called the company with service complaints say
they've been kept on hold for up to two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The problems are similar to what AtHome users in Fremont
experienced late last year. Some Fremont users, who get their
AtHome service from TCI Cable, were unable to log on to the Web and
faced molasseslike connection speeds for about three weeks. Answers
about what was causing the problem were in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   AtHome eventually fixed the problems in Fremont, blaming them on
human error. The firm said it would not happen again.
</P>
<P>
   But the complaints of customers in other cities echo those of
Fremont. Users say they are upset with the lack of answers from
AtHome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm completely frustrated with AtHome,'' said Dave Roznar, a
TCI AtHome user in Portland. ``Every other day, something else goes
wrong, and nobody in customer support ever seems to know what the
problem is.''
</P>
<P>
   Roznar said his connection is sluggish, and he's often booted
off the Internet when he accesses popular Web sites. The only way
to get back online is to reboot his computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Redwood City company is supposed to give users a super-fast
pipe to the Internet by connecting them via cable TV lines. AtHome
markets its service as being 100 times faster than a traditional
dial-up modem and touts its always-on connection. Unlike telephone
modems, cable modems are always connected to the Internet, and
customers don't need to log on each time they want to surf or check
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   AtHome has agreements with 16 cable providers in 24 states to
sell the service. It currently  &LR; has about 331,000 subscribers
nationwide who pay between $40 and $45 per month.
</P>
<P>
   AtHome officials denied there is any widespread problem but said
some users may experience glitches as the company rolls out its
service and deals with rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we get more and more subscribers out there, there are going
to be people who have a problem in one area or another,'' said Dave
Bagshaw, senior vice president of AtHome Network. ``We're going
through a learning curve every single day. This is the first time
that this kind of networking technology is being delivered to
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   AtHome points to a recent contract with AT&AMP;T as proof that the
company is trying to help users. That contract is intended to
increase the capacity of AtHome's network to accommodate more than
5 million users.
</P>
<P>
   Bagshaw said the company aims to answer 75 percent of customer
calls within four to five minutes and tries to resolve every
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Customers first call their cable provider for support, then are
routed to AtHome if the cable company can't solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   TCI, which handles all AtHome accounts in the Bay Area and has
about 40,000 AtHome users nationwide, admits some customers have
had problems with the service and with contacting technical
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since it's such a dynamic and sophisticated product there are
a lot of areas that customers have questions on,'' said Katina
Vlahadamis of TCI. To address the situation, TCI plans to add an
additional 90 people to its customer support unit for a total of
320 representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Customers say that when the service works, AtHome is great at
providing instant access to the Net and ending the World Wide Wait,
but many said that doesn't happen often enough and claim the
company treats its customers like guinea pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Barrett, an AtHome user in New Canaan, Conn., said she's
been unable to get onto the Internet through AtHome since she got
the service four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I can't get on at all and sometimes it's really
slow,'' Barrett said. ``I told AtHome many times that I was ready
to go back to my old ISP because, while the speeds weren't as fast,
the service was reliable.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to AtHome, Scott Lewis of Birmingham vented his
frustration at not being able to get the promised speeds. Lewis
said his calls and e-mails to TCI AtHome have gone unanswered and
he has been unable to get any response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought you had a very good product but now (I) see that it
is all hype,'' Lewis wrote. ``I really want to know when I can
expect, if ever, this service to be performing properly again.''
</P>
<P>
   Vlahadamis said customers such as Lewis should see a more
responsive AtHome with the additional TCI customer service reps.
She said the company is also reopening an online support center to
help answer customer questions.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for AtHome's TCI customers, but for those who
get their AtHome product through a different cable provider, TCI's
solution is not the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I joined the service just over three weeks ago, and in that
three weeks, I have placed more than nine calls to service,'' Dave
Burne, an AtHome user in Canada, said in an e-mail. Burne, who gets
his AtHome service through Rogers Cable, said it took five phone
calls before the company would admit there was a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``AtHome can't even seem to resolve one person's difficulties.
Kinda sounds like AOL a few years back. Maybe someone should file a
class-action lawsuit.''

LIKE DOMINOES, THE TOP PLAYERS FALL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ After an unpredictable second round that saw
more top-seeded players fall like dominoes, the Andersen Consulting
Match Play Championship has been whittled down to 16 players, and
most of the pre-tournament favorites are gone.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about a Tiger Woods vs. David Duval showdown. Duval,
seeded No. 2, was beaten by Bill Glasson, 2 and 1. Duval never led
and he was not sharp, missing a three-foot putt on No. 12, and an
8-foot putt for par on No. 17 to end the match.
</P>
<P>
   After a hard-fought, 1-up victory over Bob Tway Thursday, Woods
was informed that he was the only Top-10 seeded player remaining in
once prestigious field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I really?'' asked Woods. ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the tournament, Duval predicted some surprises, and his
early departure became one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play well, and you get what you deserve when you
don't play well,'' said Duval, who plans to take the next three
weeks off. ``Everybody knows I'm not the biggest proponent of this
format, but beyond that, I don't want to say anything, because it
makes it sound like I'm crying, and I'm not. I got beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Join the club. Vijay Singh, the No. 8 seed, lost to Bernhard
Langer, 2 and 1. Nick Price, the No. 9 seed, was eliminated by Jeff
Maggert, 1 up, when Price bogeyed the final hole, missing a 5-foot
putt for par. Justin Leonard, the No. 10 seed, lost to Shigeki
Maruyama of Japan, 4 and 2. Maruyama, who had a perfect 5-0 record
at the President's Cup in December, has continued his match play
assault on American players this week, eliminating Steve Stricker
and Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   So Friday morning's third round will feature Woods vs. Stewart
Cink, Langer vs. Maggert, Glasson vs. Andrew Magee, Maruyama vs.
Loren Roberts, Fred Couples vs. Steve Pate, Phil Mickelson vs.
Eduardo Romero, Steve Jones vs. Jose Maria Olazabal, and John
Huston vs. Patrik Sjoland.
</P>
<P>
   One of those 16 will emerge Sunday as the champion and earn $1
million. But with 17 of the top 20 seeded players eliminated after
two days, it is anyone's guess who will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew there were going to be top seeds that lost,'' said
Mickelson, who defeated Lee Janzen, 2 and 1. ``But we didn't expect
90 percent of them to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   In golf, however, unlike tennis or college basketball, the
difference between a No. 1 seed and a No. 64 is a fine line, one
that becomes even more vague under the pressure of match play.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday at La Costa Resort and Spa, there were numerous
momentum-changing shots, and most of them went in favor of the
lower-seeded players. In the midst of the surprises, there was
great golf and high drama. Woods was pushed to the limit. Tway came
within an inch of tying the match at No. 16, barely missing a
20-foot putt for birdie that hung on the front lip of the hole.
Then the final heartbreak for Tway came at No. 18. Woods hit a
difficult chip shot badly near a greenside bunker at No. 18, giving
Tway an opportunity to even the match with a 10-foot putt for par.
The putt looked good right up until it slid just past the left edge
of the cup. Tway closed his eyes in anguish, while Woods breathed a
sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to survive a match like this and get to the next
round, I am relieved,'' said Woods. He faces a difficult match
against Cink, who beat Woods in match play in college. ``The field
is so deep here. People have failed to realize that. And over 18
holes, anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   While Woods looked ahead, Tway was in the clubhouse, trying to
figure out how his putts on No. 16 and No. 18 stayed out of the
hole. ``I thought both of them were in,'' said Tway. ``I knew I
would be the underdog, but it didn't bother me. I knew if I played
well, I'd have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But others lost their chance Thursday, including Greg Norman,
who squandered a 3-up lead through 14 holes and lost to Romero on
the third hole of sudden death. Romero extended the match with a
terrific approach shot under pressure, hitting a 7-iron from 169
yards at No. 18 to within a foot of the hole. That led to a birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was the best shot of my life,'' said Romero.
</P>
<P>
   Norman almost lost on the second hole of sudden death when he
pulled his tee shot off a cart path out of bounds, leading to a
bogey. But Romero missed a five-foot putt to bogey as well. Romero
clinched the match on the next hole with a 20-foot birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations to him,'' Norman said. ``He was a great
competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   More twists and turns are in store for Friday, when the field is
cut from 16 to the final four, with eight matches in the morning
and four quarterfinal matches in the afternoon. Advancing to
Saturday's semifinals may require playing 36 holes or more on
Friday. Some players wondered how they would handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nerve-racking stuff,'' said Couples, who won a
difficult 1-up match over Scott Hoch. ``Tiger won a close match
because he played good. I won a close match because I was lucky. I
don't even know who I play tomorrow. But this stuff makes me so
nervous, I will be choking like a dog.''

U.S. SEEKS TO END `MIXED MESSAGES' OVER LOCKERBIE SUSPECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ On the eve of a review of economic sanctions
against Libya, the Clinton administration has asked U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to handle all communications with
Tripoli about the turnover of two suspects wanted in the 1988
bombing of a Pan American flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, Annan
indicated Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has also asked Annan to discourage efforts by
two envoys from Saudi Arabia and South Africa to give Libya further
assurances about the trial, the treatment of the suspects or
sanctions if the men are handed over, according to administration
officials and diplomats involved in the consultations.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to narrow the mediation effort reflects what one
diplomat and American officials called growing concern that Col.
Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan leader, might be receiving ``mixed
messages'' from Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to
Washington, and Jakes Gerwel, an emissary from the South African
president, Nelson Mandela. Each envoy has made more than one trip
to Tripoli trying to break the impasse between Libya and the
Security Council over where and how the suspects should be turned
over and tried, and the fate of sanctions imposed on Libya in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said that as the sanctions review
approached and efforts to resolve the crisis intensified, there was
``growing concern'' in Britain and the United States that Gadhafi
might be hearing assurances that neither the United States nor
Britain would agree to. One diplomat expressed concern that ``we
were not all reading from the same script.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan confirmed that he had met with Bandar and Gerwel on
Tuesday in Washington. He said he was ``very appreciative'' of all
that the envoys had done at his request to help clarify the
procedures under which Libya would hand over the men for trial in a
Scottish court in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to disclose specific content, Annan said he had
told the envoys that the issue was ``in the final stages before a
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Libyans, Annan said Thursday, had asked for reassurances on
one or two issues, which he refused to disclose, but which
diplomats said involved the eventual lifting of sanctions. But he
said he believed that the time for further clarifications and
assurances had passed. ``It's decision time,'' Annan said. Libya,
he added, ``must decide based on all the explanations they have
heard whether or not to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the secretary-general traveled to Libya,
diplomats said, after Gadhafi suggested through emissaries that he
was prepared for a breakthrough if Annan made the visit. There was
considerable disappointment in Washington and New York when Gadhafi
continued seeking further clarifications and assurances instead of
turning over the suspects, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday afternoon, Annan met with Abuzed Omar Dorda, Libya's
ambassador to the United Nations, apparently to emphasize his view
that the time for a decision had come, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Burleigh, the American representative at the United
Nations, said the administration agreed. ``The time for
procrastination is over,'' he said. ``We need action now from the
Libyans.''
</P>
<P>
   But immediate action is not likely, despite President Clinton's
recent promise to seek stronger measures against Libya if it
doesn't comply with demands that the men be handed over. On Friday
Annan is expected to report to the Security Council on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats here said there was little chance that the
Security Council would approve stronger measures Friday. Instead,
the officials and diplomats said, the Council is expected to ask
Libya to provide a definitive answer about whether it will turn
over the suspects within a specified time period, which some said
would be 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Officials familiar with the Libyan consultations say that
Gadhafi's major concern is whether the economic sanctions imposed
by the United Nations against Libya will be lifted. A Security
Council resolution approved last August states that as soon as the
Council has been informed that the suspects have safely arrived in
the Netherlands, sanctions are to be ``suspended immediately,'' and
90 days later could be formally lifted.

 &HT;    Summer may bring higher gas prices, experts say
 &HT;    WITH GRAPHIC
 &HT;    By Trebor Banstetter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ We're living in the good ol' days when
it comes to gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   They fell to their lowest point in 50 years this month,
according to the often-cited Lundberg Survey and historical
government data. The survey, which checks 10,000 gas stations
nationwide, found the average price for all grades of fuel was 99.8
cents a gallon in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   But enjoy it while it lasts. Experts say prices at the pump will
soon rise, spurred by summer travel, air conditioners and a
decrease in production by oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   When adjusted for inflation, today's prices are the lowest
motorists have been paying for gas since the government began
recording prices in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a gallon of gas in 1949 _ about 27 cents _ equals
$1.86 in 1999 dollars, according to the U.S. Energy Information
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Prices in Florida mirror the national trend. AAA Auto Club South
reported that the state's average price for self-serve regular
unleaded gas was 96.8 cents per gallon this month.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, gas prices hit their peak in 1981, when a gallon
cost $1.37 _ or $2.48 in 1999 dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Even a small change can make a big difference for some drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We practically live in our vehicles,'' said Nancy Smoot of
Delray Beach as she pumped gas into her large white van at a local
Shell station. ``Lower gas prices are great.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This car has a 40-gallon tank, so it's not cheap to fill,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But many energy analysts believe that after several years of
plunging, gas prices have reached the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Large fuel reserves, continued production by oil companies and
low demand due to a mild winter have kept prices down, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   When temperatures start rising, air conditioners will begin
working around the clock, meaning power plants will burn more fuel.
That, combined with a traditional increase in auto travel during
the summer, will push up demand, said Yoli Buss of AAA Auto Club
South.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the cheap gas is causing big losses for oil
companies, which are now cutting back on production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are delaying and cutting back on their big capital
projects, and many are cutting down on employment,'' said Don
Norman, research manager for the Washington, D.C.-based American
Petroleum Institute.
</P>
<P>
   So prices should level out over the next few months, and begin
to slowly rise again during the summer, said Buss.
</P>
<P>
   ``But keep in mind, a year ago they said prices would rise,''
she said. ``So no one really knows for sure.

VIRGINIA DURR, CIVIL RIGHTS CAMPAIGNER, DIES AT 95  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ala., Washington, Mass.)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Virginia Foster Durr, a well-born civil rights campaigner who
was on hand when Rosa Parks was bailed out of jail where she was
being held for not giving up her seat on a bus to a white man in
1955, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in Carlisle, Pa. She was
95.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Durr and her husband, Clifford, a lawyer, were New Deal
veterans who were in the thick of the civil rights movement in
their native Alabama in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said, in a statement: ``A white woman, born o
privilege in the Deep South, Mrs. Durr refused to turn a blind eye
to racism and intolerance in our society. Her courage and steely
conviction in the earliest days of the civil rights movement helped
to change this nation forever.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1955 Mrs. Durr and her husband helped a black civil rights
leader, E.D. Nixon, bail Mrs. Parks, a black seamstress active in
the NAACP, out of jail in Montgomery, Ala., said Dr. Patricia
Sullivan, a historian and fellow at the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute of
Afro-American Research at Harvard University. .
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Parks' action touched off the Montgomery bus boycott by
blacks, which helped spur the civil rights movement and brought the
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to prominence.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Parks said in a letter to the Durr family: ``I will miss
you, old soldier, but the rich legacy you have passed to your
children, grandchildren and great-grands lives on. We still have a
long ways to go, but you, my friend, have made it easier for all of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Birmingham, Ala., Virginia Foster was reared there
in the traditions of the Old South. She was a debutante, was
prominent in the local Junior League and attended Wellesley
College.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to Washington in the 1930s, when Durr was on the staff
of the Reconstruction Finance Corp. In the Washington of the 1930s,
many New Deal Young Turks clustered around the couple. Her personal
liberalism found expression in those years, and she was a founding
member of the interracial Southern Conference for Human Welfare,
which opposed segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Durr also helped Eleanor Roosevelt generate support for
legislation to end the poll tax, which helped prevent many
Southerners from voting. In 1948 she was an unsuccessful candidate
of Henry A. Wallace's Progressive Party for the Senate from
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later the Durrs moved to Montgomery, where they
supported the bus boycott and other civil rights activities. In
1954 she was summoned before the Senate's Internal Security
Subcommittee after being accused of harboring Communist sympathies.
She testified that she did not belong to the Communist Party and
had not attended any party meetings.
</P>
<P>
   As Rosellen Brown, a novelist, has put it, ``While the majority
of Alabamians considered Virginia and Clifford Durr traitors, not
heroes, they represented to many of us the best of the white South,
its native strength: They were sensible, outspoken, committed and
only accidentally heroic.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Durr won applause for her autobiography, ``Outside the
Magic Circle'' (University of Alabama, 1985) edited by Hollinger F.
Barnard. Dr. Sullivan is also editing a book of Mrs. Durr's
letters.
</P>
<P>
   The Durrs were married in 1926. Durr died in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Durr is survived by four daughters, Ann Durr Lyon of
Harrisburg, Pa., Lucy Durr Hackney of Philadelphia, Virginia Foster
Durr of Sweden, Maine, and Lulah Durr Colan of Milwaukee; 11
grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   REDONDO BEACH, Calif. _ The New York Times was chosen among the
country's top 10 sports sections in three separate categories this
week in voting at the winter meeting of the Associated Press Sports
Editors. Six sports reporters from The Times were also cited for
individual articles.
</P>
<P>
   In the division for newspapers with circulations of 175,000 or
more, The Times placed in the top 10 of all three categories in
which sports sections are rated: daily, Sunday and special section.
Only two other newspapers accomplished that feat: The New York
Daily News and The Atlanta Journal and Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' special section that was chosen was a guide to the
1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In section judging, 10 newspapers are cited but are not ranked
in any order. For individual articles, 10 finalists are selected,
and the top five ranked in order by a separate panel of judges in
four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Times placed two writers among the top 10 in feature
writing: Kirk Johnson, for a portrait of boxing in small gyms and
clubs, and Mike Wise, for a profile of Kenny Anderson during the
National Basketball Association lockout. The Times also placed two
staff members in the game-story category: Buster Olney, for his
article on David Wells' perfect game, and Jere Longman for his
article on Tara Lipinski's Olympic gold medal-winning performance
in figure skating.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Times writers are finalists: Mike Freeman in
investigative reporting for his portrait of the criminal problems
of New York Giants safety Tito Wooten, and Murray Chass in the
enterprise category for his two-part series on the growing impact
of Latin-American baseball players.

   JASPER _ When John William ``Bill'' King dragged James Byrd Jr.
down Huff Creek Road last summer, he did much more than just kill a
defenseless black man more than twice his age. He destroyed two
families _ Byrd's and his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of victims,'' said Byrd's sister Clara Taylor.
``We're all victims.''
</P>
<P>
   During two weeks of sometimes gruesome testimony, a dozen or so
members of Byrd's family sat at the front of one side of the
courtroom while King's frail father, Ronald King, sat on the other
side.
</P>
<P>
   The elder King, 68 and suffering from emphysema, usually sat in
his wheelchair, breathing oxygen through a tube from a container he
kept between his legs.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't there when the jury delivered the death verdict
Thursday. As the jury deliberated, he had a final visit with his
son and hugged him for what might be the last time. Prisoners on
Texas' death row aren't allowed contact visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we could always do, hug,'' Ronald King said
much earlier. ``Always hug your children.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at her son's grave on a shaded hillside in the Jasper
City Cemetery, Stella Byrd said before the trial started that she
wished she could hug her son again. ``Whenever I want to see him, I
have to come out here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She was one member of her family who chose not to come to court
to hear the horrible testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald King quickly condemned Byrd's murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts me deeply to know that a boy I raised and considered
to be the most loved boy I know could find it in himself to take a
life,'' he said in a statement released a few days after the murder
last June.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he didn't do it, and I have to stick by my boy,''
he said later.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald King said Jasper shouldn't be blamed for James Byrd's
murder. ``This isn't a racist town,'' he said. ``It just isn't that
kind of town.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that shortly after he moved to Jasper 22 years ago,
he was driving home after working a late shift at a sawmill when a
police car stopped him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him if I'd done anything wrong, and he said he had
seen my out-of-state license plates and wondered what I was doing
in a residential area at that time of the morning. That told me
that this was a community where the law enforcement looked out
after things. They were keeping us safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The police officer who stopped him was black, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever Bill King got his deadly racism, it clearly wasn't from
his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``King's father is the nicest person in the world,'' said Deann
Armstrong, a nurse's aide whose fourth anniversary celebration Byrd
attended just before he was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked at the hospital for four years, and he would come in
for treatment,'' she said. ``That hospital was pretty ugly _ lots
of people would say `nigger this, girl that.' But if you'd take Mr.
King a glass of water, he would always thank you. He never acted
like he was better than anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   After the murder, it was religious faith that helped the two
families with their grief. James Byrd Sr. and his wife had long
been active in Greater New Bethel Baptist Church, where the senior
Byrd is a deacon. But just going to church wasn't enough, his
children said. ``You have to have it in your heart,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald King is a lifelong Baptist but said he hadn't been active
in church. He had participated in some social activities at St.
Michael's Catholic Church. The Rev. Ron Foshage, pastor of the
little church and three other East Texas parishes, said he called
King and offered to be his spiritual adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless that man,'' King said. ``I couldn't get through this
without him.''
</P>
<P>
   King asked the priest to talk to his son, who had announced in
prison that he had changed his religion to Odinism, based on Norse
mythology.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill King refused to talk to the priest. ``I was relieved,''
Foshage said. ``I really didn't know what to say to him.''
</P>
<P>
   While waiting to hear the jury sentence him to death, the
younger King hugged the priest and thanked him for taking care of
his father.
</P>
<P>
   Overcome with emotion, the elder King had to leave the
courthouse before the jury's pronouncement. The priest was left to
read his statement:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to pray for healing and reconciliation,'' he read.
``Please pray for the Byrd family, who have endured unimaginable
pain and loss. Please pray for these jurors, who have shouldered a
horrible burden. Please pray for our town of Jasper, a community
that remains strong though scarred by this unspeakable act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also ask for prayers for my family, and for my son, Bill,
for redemption and healing even on death row.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the elder King said in his statement that he hopes some
good can come from the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that we all can find meaning from this tragedy, from
the needless and senseless death of James Byrd Jr. We all are human
beings, black and white. We're all children of God. We must learn
to love one another and never to hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's siblings said hate was something that was never brought
into their home as children.
</P>
<P>
   James Byrd Sr., who turned 74 the day jury selection began in
King's trial, said he thought race relations had improved in Jasper
over the decades. He remembered as a boy sometimes being taunted by
white boys while walking to school, ``and sometimes we'd want to
fight them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt empathy for Ronald King. ``I had wanted to talk
to him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The night after the jury found Bill King guilty the elder King
called the Byrds to tell them he was sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he did,'' James Byrd Sr. said, adding that the two
fathers talked for 15 minutes and he told King that he too was
sorry for his pain.
</P>
<P>
   Renee Mullins, James Byrd Jr.'s daughter, hugged the elder King
the next afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his (Bill King's) son I feel sorry for,'' she said.
``What will it be like for him growing up?''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Verrett, another of Byrd's six sisters, said she can relate
to Ronald King's sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand his grief because our parents suffered like
grief. But we also want him to know it was his son who made this
choice, who brought pain upon the father. It was not the criminal
justice system. It was not the Byrd family.''
</P>
<P>
   The Byrd family has said it intends to set up a foundation
funded by money donated since the murder. That foundation will
operate some sort of educational program to fight racism, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the murder, the town of Jasper has started a multifaceted
task force to look at racial issues in all aspects of the town's
life. Foshage is a member of the task force.
</P>
<P>
   His particular group has drawn up three goals, he said. One was
to hold a community prayer vigil. There have already been two, and
another is scheduled for March 8. Another was to dismantle an
ancient wrought iron fence that once divided the white and black
parts of the city cemetery. That has been done.
</P>
<P>
   The third might be much tougher, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to stop using the terms `black community' and `white
community,' '' he said. ``We want to end that distinction. We want
us all to think of ourselves as `we.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray said Byrd's
murder and its aftermath have caused both black and white leaders
to reconsider their beliefs. When Ku Klux Klan and armed members of
the New Black Panther Party arrived, leaders on both sides were
frightened, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked at those groups and realized that they had a whole
lot more in common with each other than they did with those
extremist groups,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ronald King and the family of James Byrd Jr. had a
lot more in common than they had differences. They were both
grieving the loss of a son.

JASPER KILLER GETS DEATH PENALTY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
and ALLAN TURNER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER _ A predominantly white jury sentenced John William
``Bill'' King to death Thursday for chaining a disabled black man
to a pickup and dragging him to his death in the Texas Piney Woods
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   After deliberating three hours, the jury returned its verdict,
making the 24-year-old white supremacist the only white man in
modern times sent to Texas' death row for killing a black.
</P>
<P>
   The family of King's victim, 49-year-old James Byrd Jr., gasped
as the verdict was read in a packed courtroom, and several burst
into tears. They then approached the railing to hug and thank each
of the white prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no remorse, even in the face of death,'' said Byrd's
sister, Mary Verrett. ``Justice would not have been served if he
could still spread his hate to other young people. It's like
gangrene. It spreads, and it is deadly.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sister, Clara Taylor, said her family does not advocate
the death penalty, but believed the evidence against King was
overwhelming and the sentence just. She described her parents as
relieved, and said her father smiled when the verdict was read.
``If you know my dad, that's rare,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   King, whose body is covered in racist and satanic tattoos,
including one depicting the lynching of a black man, had sat
stone-faced throughout two weeks of testimony and showed no emotion
to the verdict. Outside the courthouse, when asked if he had
anything to say to the Byrd family, he uttered a vulgar insult
before being pushed into a waiting car that was to take him to a
Huntsville prison.
</P>
<P>
   King's father, Ronald King, who attended the trial every day and
had pleaded with the jury to spare his son's life, left the
courtroom because of ill health before the sentence was returned.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving, he visited briefly with his son and hugged him.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald King later released a typed statement through a friend,
asking people to pray for the Byrd family and for the jurors, whom
he said had shouldered ``a horrible burden.'' He also requested
prayers for his son ``for redemption and healing, even on death
row.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger King released a handwritten statement through his
attorney: ``Though I remain adamant about my innocence, it's been
obvious from the beginning that this community would get what they
desire; so I'll close with the words of Francis Yockey. `The
promise of success is with the man who is determined to die proudly
when it is no longer possible to live proudly.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yockey, who died in 1960, was an author of Nazi doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   The jury of 11 whites and one African-American, whom they
elected foreman, had convicted Bill King of capital murder after
deliberating only 2{ hours on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, shortly before 10 a.m., they returned to the jury
room to decide his punishment. Twenty minutes later, they sent out
two notes, asking to see a knife and a hangman's noose King had
fashioned in his cell at the Jasper County Jail while awaiting
trial. They also requested letters King had written to young girls
in Jasper while he was imprisoned for burglary in 1995-97, and a
jailhouse note that he wrote to a co-defendant shortly after their
arrests last June. That note, intercepted by jailers, was a virtual
confession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked for redeeming factors,'' said juror Karen
``Lequeta'' Flowers. ``Then we read those letters and they weren't
there.''
</P>
<P>
   On the courthouse square outside, as word of the jury's decision
filtered through the crowd, Sheriff's Sgt. James Carter, an
African-American, was approached by five of his white colleagues,
who one-by-one embraced the black officer in a show of solidarity.
Several times, Carter removed his glasses and wiped his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   As burly officers blocked the sidewalk, guards escorted a pale
but smirking King from the courthouse. He was greeted by a chorus
of taunts and demands that he address local residents. King
remained silent until he uttered the vulgarity directed to the Byrd
family.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later he was in Huntsville at the James Byrd
Diagnostic Unit, named for a deceased prison warden unrelated to
his victim of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   King, an ex-con accused of masterminding Byrd's gruesome killing
to publicize a hate group he was trying to start in the Jasper
area, was the first of three white men to be tried for Byrd's June
7 kidnapping and killing. Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., 31, and
Shawn Allen Berry, 24, will be tried later.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments Thursday, prosecutor Pat Hardy told jurors
if they gave King a life prison sentence instead of death by
injection they could put someone else at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give him life, you give him at least 40 years to catch
a black guard, a black nurse, a black doctor, a Jewish guard, a
Jewish nurse, a Jewish doctor,'' he said. ``You're giving him that
long to take another life.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he admired the Byrd family for its ability to control
its anger, saying that Byrd's 20-year-old son Ross would probably
like to jump over the courtroom rail and ``stick his fist into the
chest of John William King and rip out his Satanic heart.'' Then he
asked the jury, ``Didn't you, for a second, feel the same way?''
</P>
<P>
   King's court-appointed defense lawyer, Brack Jones Jr., urged
the jury to send King back to the penitentiary, where he learned
his racist ways, and let them deal with him. And he pleaded with
the jury to consider King's father, who suffers from debilitating
emphysema and other health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your vote is not going to bring Mr. Byrd back. I wish it
could,'' Jones said. ``Your vote is not going to change the stigma
on this community, but I do think your vote could save two lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray countered that
King would kill again. ``And I don't care if he's 64 years old when
he does it,'' he said, referring to the fact that a life sentence
would mean King would be eligible for parole in 40 years. ``The
option is, do you take this man's life, or do you let him kill
again?''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Jones later said that a life prison sentence in
a 10-by-10 foot cell with only a guard for companionship could have
been worse for his client than death. ``The penitentiary is a bad,
bad place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same news conference, defense lawyer C. Haden ``Sonny''
Cribbs Jr., who earlier had pleaded with the jury, ``please don't
kill this young man,'' was asked whether King had ever expressed
remorse for his crimes. After a long, thoughtful pause, an
exhausted Cribbs sighed and answered, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   What King did display, though, was a growing anger at his fate,
said Sheriff Billy Rowles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality hit him in the last 24 to 36 hours,'' the sheriff
said, adding that on the eve of his sentencing, King had been put
under a closer watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He bowed up about that, cussing, raising Cain, kicking doors,
acting the fool,'' he said. ``He was still bowed up this morning _
obviously mad, didn't sleep, very withdrawn.''
</P>
<P>
   After court adjourned for the day, two jurors, including the
foreman, Joe Collins, who was an 8th-grade classmate of King's,
said jurors had been struck by the brutality of King's crime. Many
had trouble dealing with color photographs of Byrd's body, which
had been ground to the bone as he tried to keep his head up while
being dragged more than two miles.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's agony finally ended when he slammed into a culvert and
was decapitated. His killers left the rest of his corpse outside a
black cemetery east of Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody should be tortured like that,'' Collins said. ``That's
not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers, the other jury spokeswoman, said the panel had not been
swayed by King's tattoos, which she described as offensive, but not
illegal. She also said the jury had not intended to send a
``message'' by choosing Collins, the only black member, as foreman.
She said he was the only one to volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe was just one of us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, outside on the courthouse square, white and black
Jasper residents discussed the day's events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just sorry it's lethal injection,'' said B.W. Sanderson, a
white lifelong resident. ``It should be the electric chair and they
should turn up the power volt by volt. It should be little bit by
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Singletary, a middle-aged white woman, agreed the sentence
was appropriate. ``You take a life, you need to give a life,'' she
said. ``That's God's word.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Glenn, an African-American, also welcomed the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they hadn't sentenced them to death,'' she said in a
subdued voice, ``he would have festered like a sore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just that he's a white man. He was a person,'' she
said. ``He did what he set out to do, and he was ready to die for
what he had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``He accomplished his goal _ that's the sad thing about it.''

`WE'RE ALL VICTIMS': TWO FAMILIES IN PAIN &HT;

</P>
<P>
   ``We want to stop using the terms `black community' and `white
community,' '' he said. ``We want to end that distinction. We want
us all to think of ourselves as `we.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray said Byrd's
murder and its aftermath have caused both black and white leaders
to reconsider their beliefs. When Ku Klux Klan and armed members of
the New Black Panther Party arrived, leaders on both sides were
frightened, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked at those groups and realized that they had a whole
lot more in common with each other than they did with those
extremist groups,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ronald King and the family of James Byrd Jr. had a
lot more in common than they had differences. They were both
grieving the loss of a son.

MATCH PLAY A VOLATILE EXPERIMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ That strange thing going on this week down at the
posh but time-worn La Costa Resort and Spa is golf's version of
Russian Roulette.
</P>
<P>
   Come Sunday we'll find out if the game does catch a bullet as
the first Match Play Championship, part of the new rota designed to
showcase Planet Earth's best golfers, draws to a close.
</P>
<P>
   So far the golf has been exciting. The problem, though, is that
the two who survive for Sunday's 36-hole final may be guys we've
never heard of from places we cannot pronounce.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly won't feature the world's best (Tiger Woods)
against No.2 (David Duval), which is always the hope in these kinds
of things. Duval got a ticket out of town on Thursday courtesy of a
2 and 1 loss to Bill Glasson, ranked 34th.
</P>
<P>
   The stoic Duval had lots of company as famous names like Tom
Watson, Mark O'Meara, Greg Norman, Justin Leonard, Nick Faldo and
Colin Montgomerie, always a crowd favorite, all made quick exits.
</P>
<P>
   And they had little to say as they left.
</P>
<P>
   When play starts today, only three players in the top 20 of the
world ranking will tee it up. Fortunately, Woods will be among
them. So will Fred Couples (13) and Phil Mickelson (12).
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid I can't two-putt from 30 feet,'' Couples said
Thursday. ``This is nerve-wracking stuff. I don't even know who I
play tomorrow, but this stuff makes me so nervous I will be choking
like a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those left from the bottom of what is proving to be a very
talented group are Stewart Cink (48), Andrew Magee (50), Loren
Roberts (39), Shigeki Maruyama (42), Steve Pate (61), Eduardo
Romero, Steve Jones (51) and Patrik Sjoland (54).
</P>
<P>
   And to some of the players and spectators, the format is as
foreign as the field. Match play, where the winner is the one
winning the most holes, not the one with the fewest swipes at the
ball, is usually reserved for big amateur events and team
competitions like the Ryder and Presidents cups.
</P>
<P>
   There's no Friday on which to recover from a bad round on
Thursday. Those players that had bad rounds, bounces or luck are
all gone now.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say match play is bad. Lots of people, including
myself, like it. Especially in this format, where the brackets are
set up like the first round of the NCAA basketball championships.
</P>
<P>
   One big difference, though.
</P>
<P>
   Top to bottom, these were the 64 best players in the world.
There is no team nicknamed the Silverswords served up to a Duke or
Kentucky in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   No one thought that the lowest-ranked player in the field,
Faldo, was overmatched in his first-round match with Woods.
</P>
<P>
   And there is none of this ``I'm just going to go out and play
the course and see what happens'' stuff.
</P>
<P>
   These guys are at each other's throats as soon as the starter
says ``play away gentlemen'' or however he gets them going.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Stadler, who dispatched Montgomerie on Wednesday, refused
to concede a short putt during their match, drawing a sharp look
from the Scotsman.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe some bad blood still lingered from the last two Ryder
Cup matches.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine players on Europe's winning team at Valderrama, only
Bernhard Langer and Jose Maria Olazabal remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got beat,'' Stadler told the Associated Press of the
rest. ``And they've got a long flight home.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: While the Match Play Championship looks like it will
flourish and become a really big deal, a couple of other
tournaments are suffering at its expense.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the Tucson Open, being played this weekend at the
Omni Tucson National Resort. Duval is the defending champion, but
he isn't defending. Seventeen others who played Tucson last year
aslo skipped this year to play at La Costa.
</P>
<P>
   So after the first day's play, the well-known R.W. Eaks was the
leader, shooting an 8-under-par 64. In hot pursuit were Tom
Scherrer, Tommy Tolles, Tim Herron, Jerry Kelly, Doug Dunakey,
Steve Flesch, Dennis Paulson, Robert Allenby and Gabriel
Hjertstedt.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday and Sunday television coverage is being provided by
CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Then, next week is the Doral tournament that traditionally
signaled the start of the Real Season, as that was the first event
for the European players.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? Lots of the top 64 are taking a pass this year to
recover from the pressure of preparing for and playing in the Match
Play Championship.
</P>
<P>
   _ Even the LPGA Tour is feeling the cold shoulder. Many of that
tour's top players decided to skip this weekend's Australian Ladies
Masters because of the travel and expense involved.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes 1995 champion and world No.1 Annika Sorenstam
of Sweden, South Korean star Se Ri Pak, Meg Mallon, Beth Daniel,
Betsy King, Helen Alfredsson and Liselotte Neumann. &QL;

POP SUPERSTAR'S VOTE FOR HER TOWN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. _ Last year this affluent, image-savvy town
that abuts Newark toyed with the idea of changing its name. Worried
that the other Oranges _ namely the poorer and largely urban Orange
and East Orange _ were dragging it down, a group of residents here
proposed rechristening their 120-year-old town South Mountain
Village. The campaign, which opponents called racist, ultimately
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, after its most famous resident, Lauryn Hill,
brought home five Grammy awards, a record for a female artist,
there was little talk about burying the name South Orange. From the
local Starbucks, where Manhattan-bound commuters grab their daily
mochachinos, to Kevin's, a gritty tavern on the Newark border, this
suburb of 18,000 was reveling in the success of the country's most
celebrated hip-hop star.
</P>
<P>
   But it was more than simple pride in a local-girl-made-good.
Many residents said that Ms. Hill's decision to remain in South
Orange long after she had achieved fame was an affirmation of
integration in a town that has been struggling with its racial
identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think her success really helps legitimize our community and
its diversity,'' said the village's elected president, William
Calabrese, who opposed the name-change effort. ``We want to show
the world that our town can thrive with all colors and creeds, and
Ms. Hill is helping us do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Success for Ms. Hill, 24, came swiftly. While still in Columbia
High School, the local school, she formed the Fugees with two
friends, and although the group's first record bombed, their
second, ``The Score,'' has sold more than 17 million copies
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But it was this year's solo debut, ``The Miseducation of Lauryn
Hill,'' that brought her an avalanche of critical acclaim and
landed her on the cover of Time. The record, which won the Album of
the Year Grammy and has sold three million copies, showed Ms. Hill
to be a master songwriter and visionary artist who fuses soul, rap,
reggae and rhythm-and-blues.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hill's manager said she was not available to talk, but in
numerous interviews over the last year, she has voiced pride in her
decision to stay in South Orange. ``This is the place where I
started,'' she told Details magazine in November, a few weeks
before she had her second son, Selah. ``So the same fire I had
originally is the one I maintain when I'm here. And when it comes
to hip-hop, it's very important to stay in touch with who you are,
so I probably won't ever move very far away.''
</P>
<P>
   She recently bought a second house in South Orange, where she
lives with her parents, her boyfriend and their two children. The
house in which she grew up has been turned into a recording studio,
where she produced her Grammy album.

</P>
<P>
   Standing behind the counter of his Campus Sub Shop, Joe
Imperial, 40, said he appreciated that Ms. Hill and members of her
crew still stopped in for sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though she's a big deal, she hasn't forgotten where she
came from,'' said Imperial, recalling how he served Ms. Hill
countless chicken cheese heros when she was a child _ a sandwich he
says she invented. ``We should probably rename it for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many longtime residents and business owners, Imperial said
the changes in South Orange had been dizzying. ``It used to be all
white around here,'' he said, shaking his head as he looked out the
window. But the demographic shift, he said, has been a good thing.
His 18-year-old business is thriving, and Imperial has no intention
of leaving the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad Lauryn is sticking around,'' he said. ``I think her
decision to stay will influence a lot of the young people that this
isn't a place to run away from.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many aging suburbs on the fringe of troubled cities, South
Orange has been trying to maintain its real-estate values and
vaunted public schools in the face of heavy demographic change.
According to the 1990 Census, the town's black population grew to
19 percent, up from less than 5 percent in 1970. But a more
revealing figure is the composition of the school district, which
is now more than 50 percent black, up from 22 percent eight years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of anxiety in the community that the schools
aren't what they used to be,'' said Carol Penny Bolden, a guidance
counselor at Columbia High School in Maplewood, which draws
students from both towns. ``Of course, those of us in the building
still see the excellence, but unfortunately it's a matter of
perception.''
</P>
<P>
   To help counter negative perceptions, the two towns formed a
Racial Diversity Task Force, which has been trying to fight racial
steering by real-estate brokers while publicizing the towns to
prospective homeowners and promoting racial harmony among its
residents.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, town officials should have nothing to
complain about. Property values have soared over the last six
years, especially since New Jersey Transit began offering direct
train service to New York, which reduced the trip to Manhattan by
nearly half, to 22 minutes. The average sale price for homes in
South Orange is $240,000, up from $203,600 in 1992, according to
Roy Scott, the owner of the Re/Max Village Square Agency in South
Orange.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the changing demographics worry many residents.
</P>
<P>
   Falling test scores _ and the school's rising black population _
led some white families to send their children to private schools.
Still ranked among the best in the state, the South
Orange-Maplewood schools continue to draw outsiders. They come from
both New York City or struggling towns to the east, as did Ms.
Hill's parents, who moved here from East Orange when Lauryn was in
fifth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hill was the second of two children born to Valerie Hill, a
high school English teacher, and Mal Hill, a computer programmer.
Her family's home was crammed with Motown 45s and Sixties Soul,
which Lauryn incessantly played as a child. Music was a central
part of the Hill home. Hill sang at weddings, Mrs. Hill played the
piano and Lauryn's brother, Melaney, played the saxophone, guitar
and drums.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and former teachers recall Ms. Hill as an overachiever
who could effortlessly juggle advanced placement biology, violin
lessons and dance class. ``Lauryn was a gifted student, but more
than a student, she was a teacher, someone who influenced a lot of
other kids,'' recalled LuElla Peniston, one of her guidance
counselors.
</P>
<P>
   She founded the school's gospel choir, led the cheerleading
team, took acting classes in Manhattan and at 13, she sang Smokey
Robinson's ``Who's Lovin' You?'' at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.
For a few months she had a recurring role on ``As the World
Turns,'' and during her senior year she landed a sizable part in
``Sister Act 2.''
</P>
<P>
   All the while, she was writing and singing songs in the basement
of her friends Wyclef Jean and Prakazrel ``Pras'' Michel. The three
later took the name the Fugees (short for Refugees), and when she
was 18, they put out their first album.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Petrallia, her English teacher during sophomore and senior
year, said Ms. Hill showed other students that one can do well
academically and still have outside interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the legacy we hope she leaves,'' she said.

<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY _ A truth commission report has concluded that
the United States gave money and training to a Guatemalan military
that committed ``acts of genocide'' against the Mayan people during
the most brutal armed conflict in Latin America, Guatemala's
36-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The report of the independent Historical Clarification
Commission, which was released on Thursday, contradicts years of
official denial about the torture, kidnapping and execution of
thousands of civilians in a war that the commission estimated
killed more than 200,000 Guatemalans.
</P>
<P>
   Although the broad outlines of American support to Guatemala's
military have been known, the nine-volume report confirms that the
CIA aided Guatemalan military forces.
</P>
<P>
   The commission listed the American training of the officer corps
in counterinsurgency techniques as a key factor ``which had a
significant bearing on human rights violations during the armed
confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission, established as a part of a United
Nations-supervised peace accord that ended the war in 1996,
concluded that the government or allied paramilitary groups were to
blame for more than 90 percent of the 42,000 human rights
violations, 29.000 of which resulted in deaths or missing persons.
That attributes a somewhat higher percentage of deaths to the
government and its allies than a report last year by the Roman
Catholic Church that examined human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The commission specifically named military intelligence as the
organizer of illegal detentions, torture, forced disappearances and
executions, and it said that many massacres were a direct result of
government policy. It stopped short, however, of identifying
individuals responsible for various massacres.
</P>
<P>
   As the conclusions of the long-awaited report were read at a
solemn ceremony at the National Theater, human rights workers,
relatives of victims and others among the more than 2,000 people
broke into standing ovations, sobs, shouts and chants of ``Justice!
Justice!''
</P>
<P>
   The outbursts repeatedly interrupted speeches as the president
and cabinet members sat silently on the theater's first row.
</P>
<P>
   While the scope of the bloodshed had been generally known, the
report is the first by an internationally supported panel to lay
out the extent of the violence and pin it on the government and its
military allies. In unexpectedly strong language, it describes the
Guatemalan policy at the height of the war as a policy of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The report's estimate of more than 200,000 deaths is slightly
higher than previous figures, and the number of documented
massacres substantially exceeds figures used in previous
examinations.
</P>
<P>
   The war, which began in 1960, pitted a rightist
military-controlled government against a classic Latin American
left-wing insurgency. Largely a rural war carried out in the
hinterlands where Mayan Indians lived, the military assumed that
the Mayans sympathized with the insurgents and provided them with
supplies, intelligence and shelter.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, entire Mayan villages were attacked, burned
and inhabitants were slaughtered in an effort to deny the
guerrillas protection. The report said the Mayan population paid
the highest price, when the military identified them as natural
allies of the guerrillas. The result, the report said, was an
``aggressive, racist and extremely cruel nature of violations that
resulted in the massive extermination of defenseless Mayan
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian Tomuschat, the German jurist who led the commission's
18-month investigation, said, ``The results of our investigation
demonstrate that in general, the excuse that midlevel commanders
acted with a wide margin of autonomy _ an excuse used in an attempt
to justify what happened as ``excesses'' and ``error'' not ordered
by superiors _ is unsubstantiated and totally lacking any basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission recommended a national reparations program for
victims and exhumations of ``hundreds'' of clandestine cemeteries.
It called on President Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen and the ex-guerrilla
commanders to assume responsibility in the name of the state and
ask all Guatemalans for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The three-member commission and an international staff of 272
workers made extensive use of declassified documents from the
United States. American assistance fortified the Guatemalan armed
forces with aid and training in its anti-Communist campaign. On
Thursday, Tomuschat said the commission's investigation also found
that until the mid-1980s, American companies and government
officials ``exercised pressure to maintain the country's archaic
and unjust socioeconomic structure'' and that the CIA supported
illegal counterinsurgency operations here.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Tomuschat, the commission members were Edgar Balsells, a
lawyer, and Otilia Lux Coti, a leading Mayan educator, both of
Guatemala.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The commission did not give specific names of human rights
violators, the result of military opposition during the peace
negotiations to pointing fingers at specific people.
</P>
<P>
   But some victims' families said no true reconciliation can be
achieved in Guatemala without judicial accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be an end to impunity,'' said Helen Mack, whose
sister, Myrna, was stabbed and killed in 1990, it is believed, for
her research on the refugees driven from their homes by the army.
The case resulted in the only conviction yet of an army official
for human rights violations, and Ms. Mack is pursuing the trial of
three other officers for her sister's murder.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the weight of nine years of struggle with
Guatemala's ineffective judicial system seem to fall on her as she
broke into tears at the National Theater as the commission's
conclusions were read.
</P>
<P>
   ``We the victims feel vindicated,' she later said. ``No one can
now tell us we're following lies or ghosts anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Guatemalan officials said on Thursday that they would have a
response after they have studied the report. The army leadership
has remained defiant, accusing international and national
``actors'' for their roles in the violence and insisting the
military acted under a constitutional mandate to defend the state
from communism.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the accusations against the CIA by the commission,
the spokesman for the intelligence agency, Bill Harlow, said,
``Since we have not seen the report, it would be inappropriate for
us to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Planty, the U.S. ambassador, said, ``I believe that the
report's focus is appropriate, that these were abuses committed by
Guatemalans against other Guatemalans _ the result of an internal
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Hector M. Barrios, who has promised his own
report on the war dead and injured, said Thursday, ``I see as
positive any effort that is made on behalf of peaceful co-existence
in Guatemala.''
</P>
<P>
   Arzu left without comment after shaking hands with members of
the commission and those formally receiving the report _ Alvaro de
Soto, a senior U.N. official, and representatives of the Guatemalan
government and the ex-guerrilla group, Guatemalan National
Revolutionary Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said protocol prevented the president from personally
accepting the report, but that decision was seen by many here as
intentionally distancing the government from the commission's
findings. At several points on Thursday, people in the theater
shouted for the president to get up on stage and receive the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Affairs Minister Eduardo Stein said the government was
already implementing some of recommendations, including
compensation for victims, judicial reform and changes in the
military. Political repression has greatly been reduced in
Guatemala, by most accounts, and the guerrillas have regrouped as a
political party. There has also been a rise of Indigenous rights
and human rights organizations _ the changing times were
underscored on Thursday when scores of Guatemalans openly
confronted government officials in angry outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   But the country is still wrestling with its transition to a full
democratic state. Stark poverty and economic inequalities remain.
Despite a requirement under the peace accords that the army's size
and role be reduced, experts monitoring the progress say that there
has been checkered compliance and that the army still has a hold on
internal affairs, rather than being focused solely on the defense
of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   And just how fragile the peace is was shown last year when a
Roman Catholic bishop and leading defender of human rights, Juan
Jose Gerardi, was beaten to death with a concrete block just days
after making public the results of a three-year investigation of
human rights abuses during the war. That report, sponsored by the
Catholic church, identified specific military officers and
guerrilla groups, and church and human rights groups say they
believe the killing was meant to pressure them into renewed
silence.
</P>
<P>
   The most heartfelt applause at the National Theater Thursday
came when the bishop's name was mentioned as yet another political
victim. Many here feel the truth commission's report can help the
country's efforts toward change, but only if it is etched into the
public consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the end of the work,'' said Feliciana Macario, a
board member of a survivors' group called National Widows
Committee, which seeks reparations for the loss of homes and land
and ``moral damages,'' such as the psychological trauma suffered by
orphaned children. ``To us, this is the beginning of another
struggle.''

ANDRE DUBUS, CELEBRATED FOR SHORT STORIES, DIES AT 62  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andre Dubus, a prize-winning author celebrated for his short
stories in ``Dancing After Hours'' and other collections, died
Wednesday at his home in Haverhill, Mass. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said Gabrielle Brooks, a
representative of Dubus' publisher, Alfred A. Knopf.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Dubus stopped to help a distraught motorist by the side
of a highway outside of Boston and was hit by a passing car. As a
result, He had one leg amputated and lost the use of the other leg.
He used a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Before the accident, he was a writer of short stories with a
small circle of admirers, married to his third wife, with his sixth
child on the way. Afterward, he went through a dozen operations and
was overcome by depression. His marriage ended. It was several
years before he came to terms with the fact that he was no longer,
in his words, ``a biped,'' and began writing stories again. For
him, it was a magical rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, a book of ``Selected Stories'' was published and he won
a MacArthur award. In 1996, Dubus won the $30,000 Rea Award for
short fiction, and the following year ``Dancing After Hours'' was a
finalist for a National Book Critics Circle award. With that and
other works he achieved a wider popularity.
</P>
<P>
   His transformation as a writer was partly attributable to his
disability. As he said in an interview in 1996, ``My condition
increased my empathy and rid me of my fear of disability and
misfortune.'' Asked if he had become a better writer after the
accident, he said, ``I hope so. That would be a blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, he was devoted to the art of the short
story, calling himself ``a volunteer'' to the form. In the 14
stories in ``Dancing After Hours,'' he wrote with great sensitivity
about small, quiet lives, sometimes interrupted by violence. In
them, the ordinary becomes the extraordinary as love often triumphs
over loneliness _ and disability. Many of the stories are told from
a woman's point of view and deal with men who are physically
impaired.
</P>
<P>
   In the poignant title story, people in a neighborhood bar in a
small town share a long evening of mutual understanding. What
unites them is a quadriplegic who has a remarkable sense of self.
He has become fearless after his accident, even parachuting from a
plane. Dubus said he thought of the story in western terms: a
stranger comes into town and when he leaves, things have changed.
In common with the character in the story, the author, a man with a
natural ebullience, dominated his wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   This story and others take place in working-class towns north of
Boston, the area in which Dubus lived. Reviewing the collection in
the New York Times Book Review, Richard Bausch said that the title
story was ``one of the most gracious and exquisite works of fiction
I have ever read,'' adding that the book ``is suffused with grace,
bathed in a kind of spiritual glow.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubus was born in Lake Charles, La., where he went to McNeese
State College. He joined the Marines thinking it would be ``a
romantic way to make a living as a writer.'' He rose to the rank of
captain, but left the military after six years. He studied writing
with the novelist Richard Yates at the University of Iowa, wrote
his first novel, ``The Lieutenant'' (1967), and published stories
in various magazines. The first book was followed by ``Separate
Flights,'' ``Adultery &AMP; Other Choices,'' ``Finding a Girl in
America,'' ``The Times Are Never So Bad,'' ``Voices from the Moon''
and ``The Last Worthless Evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Then on that night in 1986, he did a good deed and suffered
awful consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 in Cambridge, Mass., a group of writers including Ann
Beattie, John Irving, Stephen King, John Updike, Kurt Vonnegut and
Yates gave a series of readings from their work to raise money for
the injured author. In ``Broken Vessels,'' a collection of
autobiographical essays published in 1991, he thanked the writers
and those who came to the readings because they ``made me feel,
during a very bad time, that I had hundreds of friends I didn't
even know.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Introduction to ``Broken Vessels,'' Tobias Woolf wrote:
``Andre has made of his wheelchair a place to see the world more
clearly than ever. I was struck again and again by the range of his
vision, by its depth and compassion, and by the music by which he
gives it voice.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two sisters, Elizabeth Baldridge and Kathryn
Selleck; six children, Suzanne, Andre, Jeb, Nicole, Cadence and
Madeleine, and five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he published ``Meditations from a Movable Chair,'' a
collection of essays evoking themes in his stories. In one, he
wrote about his accident, an event that continued to haunt him.
Driving back to Boston in 1996, he passed by the place where it
occurred and remembered his thoughts at the time: ``I had the
windows down on the car. I could smell the trees in the forest.''
He said that he had thought about turning off at an exit, but then
decided to stay on the highway. If he had taken that exit, he said,
``Who knows what would have happened?''
</P>
<P>
   A Roman Catholic, Dubus had deep religious convictions and
believed in the presence of God and angels in everyday life. To the
suggestion that his ``angel'' must have blinked on the night of the
accident, he said he was lucky not to have been killed or
paralyzed: ``Maybe the angel grabbed my collar and pulled me a
little higher.''

CHARLES BLITZER, FOUNDER OF WOODROW WILSON CENTER, DIES AT 71  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Blitzer, a founder and director emeritus of the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington and a past
president of Phi Beta Kappa, died on Friday at his home in
Washington. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pulmonary disease, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Blitzer founded the Woodrow Wilson center in 1971 with Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., as an affiliate of the Smithsonian
Institution dedicated to advanced academic research in
international relations and political and social studies. He served
as its third director, from 1988 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Blitzer prepared the center for its recent move to larger
quarters in the Ronald Reagan Building on Pennsylvania Avenue,
where it serves about three dozen scholars on annual fellowships
with still others who visit to do research. After his retirement
and election to director emeritus, he was succeeded by former Rep.
Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Blitzer, a native New Yorker, graduated from Williams
College in 1927 and earned a master's degree. in 1949 and a
doctorate in 1952 at Harvard University. He began his academic
career as a political science instructor at Yale University and in
the early 1960s worked as executive associate at the American
Council of Learned Societies in New York.
</P>
<P>
   His association with the Smithsonian began in 1965, when he
joined the staff as director of education. He served as assistant
secretary for history and art from 1968 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   At Phi Beta Kappa, he held several official positions, beginning
in 1979. He was a former member of the academic honor society's
senate and served as vice president and then president from 1991 to
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Blitzer was also a longtime member and recent chairman of the
Indo-United States Sub-Commission on Education and Culture and
served on the United States-New Zealand Council, among other
international affiliations. He was a past trustee of Smith College
and in recent years served as chairman of a publications
subcommittee at the Holocaust Memorial Museum.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a brother, Dr. John R. Blitzer, of Bradford,
N.H.

MICROSOFT WITNESS PEPPERED WITH QUESTIONS FROM JUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A government lawyer and Microsoft's next-to-last
witness had been sparring for hours Thursday when the presiding
judge asked a few questions of his own that cut to the core of the
company's defense. He spoke with a tone of skepticism that had
several lawyers at Microsoft's table leaning forward tensely,
mouths half open.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, Joachim Kempin, a Microsoft vice president, had
been reciting the same argument that each of the company's
witnesses had offered over the last several months _ that Microsoft
Corp. had chosen to combine the company's Web browser with its
industry-standard Windows operating system because the combination
benefited consumers.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated that argument several times as the government's lead
trial lawyer, David Boies, showed him memo after e-mail after
document indicating that other Microsoft executives had clearly
wanted to tie the browser to Windows to trump their most important
competitor, Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you think integration made it a better product?''
Jackson asked. His tone, normally amiable with questioning
witnesses, was tinged with skepticism bordering on incredulity.
</P>
<P>
   Kempin gave a familiar response, one that is central to
Microsoft's defense. Users get the same graphical interface when
they use the computer help system as when they browse the Internet,
he said. ``And it makes it easier to organize the computer,'' he
said. ``There's no difference in the interface between your own
files or on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   But the judge seemed unconvinced. ``You think consumers derive
some benefit from knowing that it's on the hard drive or the
Internet?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's seamless,'' Kempin responded, to which the judge
asked again: ``Why is that better for consumers?''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will rest its case on Friday, and as the judge's
questions Thursday afternoon demonstrated, the trial has not gone
well for the company. Again Thursday, Boies managed to trip up
Kempin and raise credibility questions about his testimony, as has
been true of almost every witness who has testified for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Boies questioned Kempin for a second day about the company's
policies with regard to allowing computer makers to alter the
Windows main screen, or desktop, by adding their own software and
graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Kempin said Microsoft developers believed that computer makers
were ``butchering Windows'' with their modifications. Nonetheless,
he said, his company has been ``very generous'' over the years in
the changes it had allowed.
</P>
<P>
   But Boies presented or described memos from executives of
computer makers, including Gateway, Packard Bell-NEC and
Hewlett-Packard, who were upset about Microsoft's restrictions on
changes to the desktop.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a senior Hewlett-Packard executive wrote, ``From the
consumers' perspective, we are hurting our industry and our
customers.'' And he added, ``If we had a choice of another
supplier, based on your actions in this area, I assure you, you
wouldn't be our supplier of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Kempin dismissed this, calling the exchange ``nothing but a
dispute between two companies looking for the right balance.''
</P>
<P>
   As the day wore on, Boies showed several documents suggesting
that the real reason Microsoft was concerned about modifications to
Windows was that the manufacturers' screens covered up the icon for
Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer. Kempin said he thought
that was wrong but offered no substantiation.
</P>
<P>
   Then Boies asked whether it was true that Microsoft had
expressed threatening disapproval to computer manufacturers that
worked with Netscape. Kempin responded that the manufacturers
``determine their own destiny,'' adding, ``I have a hard time
believing we can tell them what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Boies read from a document in which a Gateway executive
recalled a conversation in which a Microsoft executive had told him
that Gateway's support of Netscape was ``a huge issue for
Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Boies asserted, ``Microsoft charges Gateway a
significantly higher price for Windows than Microsoft charges Dell
or Compaq.''
</P>
<P>
   Not true, Kempin said. But then he clarified: Gateway is in fact
charged more, he said, but for other reasons that he would not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Boies read more from the Gateway memo, including an assertion
from a Gateway executive that Microsoft's actions were illegal. But
before he could finish, the judge took the memo and repeated some
of the allegations, asking Kempin: ``How about all these other
things? Do you deny all of these, too?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Gateway's version,'' Kempin said. ``I have no
knowledge of this.''

HELPED BY BLOCKBUSTER UNIT, VIACOM POSTS SOLID QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Viacom Inc. reported a strong fourth quarter Thursday, as
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose
24 percent, to $502.4 million, from $406.1 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue in the quarter, ended Dec. 31, rose 15 percent, to $3.34
billion, from $2.9 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons between the two quarters were difficult to make,
however, since each included a significant number of one-time
charges and gains.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent quarter, for example, included a $3.4 million
gain related to the $4.6 billion sale of Simon &AMP; Shuster in
November to Pearson PLC, and represents the difference between the
proceeds and the book value. Last quarter also included a loss of
$74.7 million for early redemption of debt, and a $30 million gain
related to the redemption of preferred stock at a discount.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 quarter included a $1.1 billion gain from the sale of
Viacom's half-interest in USA Networks to Seagram Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Hatch, an analyst with Cowen &AMP; Co., said that results at
Viacom's Blockbuster unit were very strong; the chain of video
rental stores saw a 15 percent increase in same-store sales.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Hatch said, the vibrancy of Viacom's cable network
brands was evident. The success of ``The Rugrats Movie'' also
helped the entertainment division.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom said Thursday that it would switch its listing to the New
York Stock Exchange from the American Stock Exchange, where it had
been one of the most widely traded stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom also said it planned a 2-for-1 stock split. The split,
which is to be in the form of a dividend, is scheduled for March
31.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom said that its cable networks _ MTV, Nickelodeon/Nick at
Nite and VH1 _posted an 18 percent increase in cash flow to $291.7
million, from $246.7 million, as advertising revenue rose.
</P>
<P>
   Profit at the entertainment division jumped 21 percent, to $98.5
million, fueled by the success of ``Rugrats'' domestically and
``The Truman Story'' and ``Saving Private Ryan'' overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Profits at Blockbuster rose 28 percent, to $127.6 million, which
makes it increasingly likely that Sumner Redstone, the chairman of
Viacom, will proceed with a two-step plan to spin off 20 percent of
the company to the public and sell the balance later.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were particularly pleased with Blockbuster's
performance since the future of the home video business seemed
threatened by the advent of pay-per-view and other technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster's earnings improved even as the company added 146
new video stores in the third quarter, ending the year with 6,379
stores.

LIVINGSTON BIDS FAREWELL TO HOUSE THAT HE MIGHT HAVE LED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thursday was the last working day for Rep. Robert
L. Livingston, the almost-speaker of the House, who plans to go
into business as a lobbyist here starting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a short farewell address on the House floor, Livingston
referred obliquely to ``a few failures'' and ``a few moments of
heartache'' in the institution he had hoped to lead. Without naming
names, he suggested that some of his colleagues had been less than
``statesmen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tolerance is a necessity,'' he said. ``And compromise is the
glue that renders democracy possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, after admitting to having had extramarital
affairs, Livingston renounced the speakership, to which he had been
designated, just before the House began voting to impeach President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, R-La., also said at the time that he would leave the
House, to which he was first elected in 1977, in six months. But he
pushed up his official retirement to Feb. 28 to allow for an
earlier special election in the state's First Congressional
District.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, 56, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee for
four years, can now start to make some serious money, a goal that
led him to consider quitting Congress a year ago, until he decided
to stay and run for speaker. As a representative, Livingston made
more than $136,000.
</P>
<P>
   He and his long-time chief of staff, Allen Miller, are starting
a lobbying firm called the Livingston Group. It is affiliated with
the New Orleans firm of Jones, Walker, Waechter, Poitevent, Carrere
&AMP; Denegre, which also has offices in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As a former member of Congress, Livingston is barred from
lobbying directly on Capitol Hill for one year, but can offer
advice and guidance to clients with business there.
</P>
<P>
   As the chairman of the committee that oversees federal spending,
and as the onetime speaker-designate, Livingston is highly familiar
with the levers of power in Congress. There is no doubt of his
access. On the House floor Thursday, Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., whom
Livingston anointed to succeed him as chairman of the
Appropriations Committee, said he hoped Livingston would ``feel
free to stay in touch with this member.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston follows several other retiring Republicans into the
ranks of lobbyists. Former Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon, of Glens
Falls, N.Y., has opened his own firm, which will be affiliated with
a lobbying shop headed by former Sen. Paul Laxalt of Nevada. Former
Rep. Bill Paxon of Buffalo, has joined Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP;
Feld.
</P>
<P>
   As he left the House floor Thursday, Livingston told reporters:
``I feel lighter. I don't have to worry about all the problems, all
over the world, all the time. And I just have to worry about the
next paycheck.''

OLOWOKANDI VS. SHAQ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By RANDY HILL &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Long Beach Press-Telegram &LR;  &QC; 
ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The review is in:
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a unique combination of a lot of size and quickness,''
Michael Olowokandi said. ``He's quick, big and strong. I really
can't wait to get it out of the way. If he's gonna beat me down,
he's gonna beat me down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like Olowokandi, the Clippers' rookie center, is filing a
scouting report on Godzilla. But this was worse. He was calling
roll on the list of woe presented by Thursday's individual
challenge ... Laker center Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first skirmish between O'Neal, the NBA first draft
pick in 1992, and Olowokandi, who achieved that distinction last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a handful,'' the 7-foot, 270-pound Olowokandi said of
O'Neal, who checks in at an inch taller and 60 pounds - give or
take a missing steer - heavier. ``Our entire defensive philosophy
has changed because of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi's philosophy? The first time, it's not personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely not a personal battle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Good thinking. O'Neal could finish the season as the league's
top scorer. Olowokandi, now in just his fourth season of organized
basketball, is only hoping the officials start giving him the same
latitude in trotting out his entire offensive repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the same moves they get me for are working for him,''
Olowokandi said. ``Hopefully, they'll start working for me.
</P>
<P>
   subhead Board meeting scheduled
</P>
<P>
   Clippers power forward Maurice Taylor completed Thursday's
pre-game maneuvers with this prediction: ``I feel a monster game
coming on.''
</P>
<P>
   It was assumed Taylor was referring to himself as the monster.
He certainly was that in the team's first game at The Pond this
season, a double-overtime loss to Vancouver last last week. Taylor
scored 21 points and grabbed 20 rebounds in that one.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, he figures to go at it with the newest Laker,
rebounding mercenary Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as just another game,'' Taylor said of matching
rebounding wits with Rodman. ``Sure, I want to do well against him,
but I want to do well against everybody. I'm really not having any
consistency rebounding.

CUBA CUTS OFF DIRECT PHONE SERVICE FROM U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Cuba suspended direct dial telephone service connections
with the United States on Thursday, saying it would not restore the
link until a Cuban telephone provider received money it was owed by
five American telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for AT&AMP;T, which operates over half of the 1,020
circuits affected by the cutoff, said that the company had been
forced to reroute calls to Cuba through third countries and that if
customers were persistent, they could get through. But some who
tried to call said they were unable to get through despite trying
for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Since November, about $19 million in payments to the Cuban phone
service have been delayed because of a lawsuit by the families of
four fliers who were shot down and killed by the Cuban air force in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Judge James Lawrence King of Federal District Court here ordered
the Cuban government to pay $187.6 million to the pilots' families.
Since then, the families have been trying to collect the money from
frozen Cuban assets and payments to Cuba for the telephone service.

   TELECOM ITALIA SAYS NEW BID FROM OLIVETTI IS STILL FLAWED
</P>
<P>
   The board of Telecom Italia has called the revised $60 billion
unsolicited takeover offer from rival Olivetti seriously flawed and
decided to study how to integrate its fixed-line operations with
the mobile phone unit Telecom Italia Mobile, in which it holds a 60
percent stake. Such a move would increase Telecom Italia's net
worth and raise the price Olivetti would have to pay by several
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti first proposed buying Telecom Italia over the weekend
with a $60 billion package of cash and securities that marked one
of the biggest hostile takeover attempts of any company. Italian
stock market regulators ruled the bid invalid earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   OXFORD HEALTH HAS A SMALLER LOSS
</P>
<P>
   Oxford Health Plans said that its fourth-quarter loss narrowed
as the company worked to turn around its finances. The health
maintenance organization reported a loss of $18.8 million, or 23
cents a share, while analysts had expected a loss of 78 cents.
Shares of Oxford fell $1.3125, to $18.375.
</P>
<P>
   PENNEY PROFIT NEARLY FLAT; GAP UP
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Penney reported disappointing earnings as it continued to
struggle against competition from cheaper discount chains and
trendier retailers like the Gap, which beat expectations with its
latest quarterly report.
</P>
<P>
   NOVELL EARNINGS MORE THAN DOUBLE
</P>
<P>
   Novell reported that its first-quarter profit more than doubled
compared with year-earlier figures. The company cited the improved
performance to strong sales of products using its Directory
technology, which helps find multiple users across a network.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos, the World Wide Web gateway that is being bought by USA
Networks, reported that it lost $9.3 million partly because of
costs of its acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit, the maker of personal-finance software, reported
better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings, buoyed by
sales of its Turbo Tax tax-preparation software.
</P>
<P>
   DAIMLERCHRYSLER PROFITS RISE 28%
</P>
<P>
   Reporting its financial results as a combined company for the
first time, DaimlerChrysler said that 1998 earnings rose 28 percent
on the strength of improved sales of vehicles and Airbus planes.
Results from the world's fourth-largest car maker and Europe's
biggest industrial company were at the low end of financial
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE POSES QUESTIONS TO MICROSOFT
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson posed several pointed questions to
one of the last witnesses testifying for Microsoft at its antitrust
trial. The questions, which cut to the core of the company's case,
concerned why Microsoft had chosen to combine the company's Web
browser with its Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ESPRIT ATTEMPTS A SALES COMEBACK
</P>
<P>
   An advertising and marketing effort is seeking to revive the
Esprit lines of sportswear, footwear and accessories, which were
popular in the 1980s. The would-be comeback is indicative of
ambitious plans by marketers to capitalize on strong consumer
demand for name-brand products.
</P>
<P>
   VIACOM EARNINGS UP 24% IN QUARTER
</P>
<P>
   Viacom reported a strong fourth quarter as earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 24 percent, to
$502.4 million. The publishing and entertainment company also plans
to move to the New York Stock Exchange from the American Stock
Exchange in April.

SPORTS COLUMN: MARBURY WEIGHS BUSINESS OF A MADISON SQUARE GARDEN
HOMECOMING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Everyone wants to know what Stephon Marbury is going
to do: Is he going right? Going left? Will he stay put in Minnesota
with the Timberwolves? Jump ship and join the Bulls' cleanup
campaign? Or will the league's best young point guard submit to a
trade that brings him home to New York City?
</P>
<P>
   What's he going to do? Dribble or shoot?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm going to concentrate on basketball,'' Marbury
said Thursday morning after a Timberwolves practice at Madison
Square Garden. He spoke passionately about wanting play on the
Olympic team. But when the New York issue was raised, he squashed
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way that that will happen,'' he said. ``I couldn't
see it.''
</P>
<P>
   What about being signed by Minnesota and then traded?
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have anyone that Minnesota would want for me ; I
don't think Kevin McHale is that stupid,'' Marbury said, referring
to the Timberwolves' vice president of basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
   We're about to see how savvy McHale is.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury is blossoming as a player and a commodity. This week he
was named the NBA's player of the week after becoming the fifth
player in league history to record at least 40 points and 10
assists in a game without a turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he averaged 24.3 points and a league-high 11.8
assists and shot 55 percent from the field as the Timberwolves won
3 of 4 games. Minnesota is 8-2, the best start in team history.
</P>
<P>
   Teams are becoming obsessed with Marbury. The Lakers need him to
break a cycle of the blind leading the blind in pursuit of a
championship; the Bulls need him to clean up the mess created by
cleaning house; the Knicks, in their strip-mining approach to
discovering a championship, need Marbury the way a furnace needs
coal.
</P>
<P>
   What's best for Marbury? Chicago is a disaster waiting to
happen, New York is a well-heeled trap. How many hometown heroes
have done well in New York early in their careers? Bernard King
came to the Knicks near the end of his career and flourished. Mark
Jackson began here on a high note but was traded, Rod Strickland
became disgruntled and was traded.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury's thoughts change as rapidly as the business. At 22, he
still tries to balance the romance of the game he felt in high
school with the finance of the game.
</P>
<P>
   I watched Marbury on Wednesday when he sat courtside at the
Garden watching St. John's roll to its 23rd victory of the season.
Marbury had a fling with college _ one season and out at Georgia
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not miss the college environment, preferred the
honesty of the pros where the game is about money and performance
and everyone knows it. What he loves about the Garden are memories
that go back to Lincoln High School in Brooklyn. The Garden was the
scene of two bitter setbacks as his team lost its bid for the city
championship his sophomore and junior years.
</P>
<P>
   But even in defeat there was a subtle victory. In 1994, a
seat-throwing melee erupted following a preliminary game on the
night Lincoln played for the New York City Public Schools Athletic
League title.
</P>
<P>
   School officials asked Marbury, a junior, to get on the Garden's
public-address system and ask for calm. After he spoke, there was
no further disruption. Lincoln lost the championship, but Marbury
gained a new sense of himself.
</P>
<P>
   A year later Marbury scored 28 points against Paul Robeson High
School and won MVP honors as Lincoln won the long-sought city
championship. Marbury sank to his knees, pressed his face to the
hardwood and cried.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always ask me all the time about the most memorable
game I've ever played in,'' Marbury said Thursday. ``I always say
the city championship games. People say, `Well, what about the
Bulls?' But there really is no comparison. To grow up here and to
play in the city. You have to live in the city and play in the PSAL
to understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   He grew up a Knicks fan. Last year he suggested that his desire
to be a Knick had as much to do with fulfilling a childhood dream
as it had to do with money. Back then he complained about the
Minnesota winters, the deserted streets of downtown Minneapolis.
Back then he said: ``Me thinking about playing for the Knicks isn't
a fantasy. That's reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday he hinted that he had loosened his grip on childhood
dreams. ``By me getting older, I'm just getting adjusted to
Minnesota, it's starting to become part of my life,'' Marbury said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to see that it's more like a business. When I
finally realized that it was a business, I looked at my options and
said to myself, `I'm working right now and I have my free time in
the summers.' I'm able to look at Minnesota totally different.''
</P>
<P>
   As the informal gathering with reporters broke up, Marbury
tossed one final curve when someone suggested that he might be
better off for now staying away from New York, growing up away from
home where mistakes would be less public, less of a weight. Marbury
brushed that aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been walking with the world on my shoulders since I was a
little kid,'' he said. ``It won't make a difference to me now.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wants to know what Stephon Marbury is going to do?
Dribble or shoot? &QL;

IN FIRST COMBINED RESULTS, DAIMLERCHRYSLER PROFIT RISES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER and STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reporting its financial results as a combined company for the
first time, DaimlerChrysler AG said Thursday that its 1998 earnings
rose 28 percent on the strength of improved sales of vehicles and
Airbus planes.
</P>
<P>
   But the figures from DaimlerChrysler, the world's fourth-largest
automaker and Europe's biggest industrial company, were at the low
end of financial analysts' expectations, and contributed to a 5
percent drop in the company's share price. DaimlerChrysler closed
at $95.8125 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, down
$5.125.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the earnings also coincided with increased
speculation that the company was nearing an agreement to buy a
significant part of the ailing Nissan Motor Co. of Japan. Shares of
Nissan surged nearly 6 percent on heavy trading in Tokyo on
Thursday on investor expectations that a deal was close.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding one-time merger costs, DaimlerChrysler's earnings rose
to 5.2 billion euros ($5.72 billion) or 5.6 euros a share, compared
with the equivalent of 4.06 billion euros, or 4.28 a share, in
1997. (The euro came into being in January 1999.)
</P>
<P>
   Sales at DaimlerChrysler, which is based in both Stuttgart,
Germany, and Auburn Hills, Mich., rose 12 percent, to 131.8 billion
euros, or $145 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the gain came on improved sales of both Chrysler and
Mercedes-Benz cars and light trucks in the United States. The
results also reflected increased aircraft sales in 1998 by Airbus
Industrie, the four-nation European consortium in which
DaimlerChrysler holds a 37.9 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 results were calculated on the assumption that
Daimler-Benz and Chrysler were one company at the time.
DaimlerChrysler intends to begin reporting quarterly results after
the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler was formed in November when Daimler-Benz
completed its takeover of Chrysler in the biggest foreign
acquisition of an American industrial company.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The combination appears to have started a consolidation in the
global automotive industry, with Ford Motor Co. agreeing in January
to buy the car business of Volvo of Sweden for $6.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   There have been growing expectations that Nissan, Japan's No. 2
automaker and sixth largest over all, would sell at least part of
itself to a foreign automaker because it is $20 billion in debt and
its sales have weakened in Japan and the United States. Nissan
president Yoshikazu Hanawa has made no secret of his effort to sell
the company _ which is highly unusual in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Most frequently mentioned as a possible buyer is
DaimlerChrysler, particularly since its two chairmen, Juergen
Schrempp and Robert Eaton, met with Hanawa a month ago. Speculation
about a possible deal intensified Wednesday when the Kyodo news
agency of Japan said the two sides were close to an agreement that
would give DaimlerChrysler a 33.4 percent stake, although they
denied it.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's attraction for DaimlerChrysler is clear, as are the
risks associated with any deal. DaimlerChrysler's sales have been
running so strong that it is critically short of factory capacity.
Nissan's plants in Europe and North America have not been running
full time because of slow sales. Its complex in Smyrna, Tenn., has
repeatedly been rated the most efficient assembly plant in the
United States by Harbour &AMP; Associates, a manufacturing-
productivity consultant. Nissan's lineup of cars is also similar to
the Chrysler lineup, so a merger could result in considerable
savings by combining models.
</P>
<P>
   But the risks are huge. The biggest involves Nissan's heavy
debt, which has scared off other potential bidders. DaimlerChrysler
is also struggling to bring American managers from Chrysler into
its German hierarchy, and the addition of a Japanese automaker to
the group could cause further cultural difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo on Thursday, large numbers of reporters and camera men
gathered outside Nissan's headquarters in the Ginza district, only
to be disappointed as the day dragged on and the company stood by
its denial of a deal with DaimlerChrysler. Securities analysts who
were calling clients to advise them that the deal was all but done
admitted when pushed that they were betting the Kyodo report was
partly accurate.
</P>
<P>
   There was at least circumstantial evidence that the two
companies are in talks: A group of five or six German-speaking men
headed out of Nissan headquarters late Thursday in the company of a
Japanese man.
</P>
<P>
   People in the auto industry have speculated that DaimlerChrysler
may try to insulate itself from Nissan's debt troubles by buying
less than half the company, giving it at least one Nissan board
seat and veto power. But that could still leave management in the
hands of the same men who have managed the company into its current
perilous state.

NOVELL NET MORE THAN DOUBLED IN FIRST QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Novell Inc. reported Thursday that its first-quarter earnings
had more than doubled relative to a year ago, a performance that
just met analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The company attributed the improved performance to strong sales
of products using its Directory technology, which helps locate
multiple users across a network.
</P>
<P>
   Novell reported its results after the market's close, but its
shares had gained nearly 10 percent Thursday after Charles
Phillips, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, raised his
rating on Novell to ``outperform'' from ``neutral.'' Novell shares
closed at $20.875, up $1.875, in heavy Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   Novell's Netware 5.0, which includes the Directory technology,
is getting a boost right now because Microsoft Corp. lacks a
competing offering for its Windows NT operating system. Microsoft
has promised a comparable feature in the next version of NT, but
the new operating system has been delayed repeatedly and is now not
expected until next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you buy into the need for directory services, and you're
going to place your bet on Novell or Microsoft, one company has
product today and the other one doesn't,'' said Paul Dravis, an
analyst with Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. ``Is the world all
Microsoft, or is the Internet the platform of the future? In that
world, Novell has a franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Jan. 31, Novell reported earnings of $29
million, or 8 cents a diluted share, more than twice the $14
million, or 4 cents a share, reported in the comparable period a
year ago. Revenues rose 13 percent, to $286 million, over the $252
million recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 1998.
Per-share figures reflect a reduction in the number of shares
outstanding because of continuing share repurchases.
</P>
<P>
   Novell's earnings matched the consensus estimate, according to
First Call, as of Thursday. But until Thursday, when an new analyst
added his estimate to the consensus, First Call had been projecting
earnings of 9 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right on our business plan; this was a very good quarter
for us,'' Dennis Rainey, Novell's chief financial officer, said in
a telephone interview. He said sales reflected strong growth in the
segments of Novell's business that are directory related, which
accounted for 88 percent of total revenue in the quarter. ``What
that really reinforces is that companies are stepping up and
investing in the directory to manage their global
infrastructures,'' Rainey said.

SPORTS COLUMN: NETS' OWNERS COULD HELP SOUTH BRONX
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Where? This is the biggest journalistic question of
all, as the famous Yankees and the infamous Nets agree to agree.
</P>
<P>
   The potential half owners of the Yankees are Jersey guys, whose
record of social commitment leaves context clues that this just
might be a good deal for the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The word from inside is that this is a specifically 50-50 deal,
which means George Steinbrenner is going to have to learn to work
well and play well with others, that old kindergarten criteria. And
just where is the Yankees' sandbox going to be located after the
lease runs out at Yankee Stadium in 2002?
</P>
<P>
   These new owners of the Nets have kept their roots. Lewis Katz
has put his money into Camden, his hometown. Ray Chambers, born in
Newark, has sponsored young people in private schools and donated
money to the arts. Finn Wentworth and Bill Cosby and the other new
owners have shown an impulse for tying the Nets into the community.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest clue about the future of the Yankees may come from
the way the new owners of the Nets have talked of building an arena
in the heart of Newark, as troubled as it may be.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets (and Devils and Giants and Jets and MetroStars)
currently play in the Meadowlands, a complex in the swamplands,
still unreachable by rail transportation _ undoubtedly on purpose,
to keep poor people out.
</P>
<P>
   The Man From Tampa has often displayed a Sun Belter's abhorrence
of the South Bronx, but political developments have caused his team
to be locked there like a car caught in traffic on the Major
Deegan.
</P>
<P>
   George couldn't get downtown because New York City taxpayers
would revolt against Mayor Giuliani's unfocused fantasies. George
couldn't get across the river because of Gov. Whitman's principled
stand against spending public money on a baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Now George has been rescued from his major problem of needing
instant cash. In his own overbearing way, he is a throwback, whose
main business is his baseball team, a latter-day Stoneham, a
latter-day Griffith. With this deal, George can settle his estate
and still leave half the team to his heirs, without having to get
out of baseball the way the O'Malleys did.
</P>
<P>
   This is potentially a much better deal for the public than the
one that was being discussed with Cablevision, until George smarted
off and said he would always have control of the Yankees. As it is,
there are too many sinister overlaps of television and team
ownership, eh, mate?
</P>
<P>
   George now has credible allies in his hopes to build a new
stadium. Except for building a great team, he has left precious
little personal or philanthropic mark on New York.
</P>
<P>
   The first assumption was that George's new pals would envision a
short train ride from Manhattan or suburban New Jersey to a new
stadium in Newark. They could probably even get away with calling
it Yankee Stadium, given the history of the Yankees' AAA farm team,
the Newark Bears, playing downtown in Ruppert Stadium when the
Yankees were tromping with hobnailed boots over the American League
in the 30s and 40s.
</P>
<P>
   (Please don't think I'm not being overly romantic. Given
baseball's alarming tropism toward luxury boxes and waiter service,
for goodness' sakes, the poor people of Newark would be as
hard-pressed to buy tickets as the poor people of the Bronx.)
</P>
<P>
   However, the proposed deal does not signify a tilt to New
Jersey, insists Howard J. Rubenstein, the public relations man who
will be a minor partner in the deal. Rubenstein said the Yankees
still have three options _ the Bronx, midtown Manhattan or New
Jersey. And New Jersey could be either the Meadowlands or Newark.
</P>
<P>
   This could all be a ploy to squeeze New York to build a new
Yankee Stadium for the new owners. People who know development say
there is enough space between the Harlem River and the immovable
hills for a new stadium, parking, restaurants and shops, as well as
megastores that would provide jobs.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The old Yankee Stadium could stay just where it is, a living
museum, a world-level field of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   With their record in New Jersey, the potential owners seem quite
capable of making their own judgment that a social gesture is just
as important in the South Bronx as it is in Newark. Neighborhoods
are neighborhoods. People are people.
</P>
<P>
   They also do not want to be known _ forever _ as arrivistes who
moved the Yankees out of New York. What is most needed is vision,
activism, a feel for old cities, a true sense of roots. The Yankees
have needed that more than they needed Roger Clemens. &QL;

NEWLY RELEASED TAPES FEATURE DARK BRAINSTORMING BY NIXON 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs lede to change order of references to Kennedy and embassy
break-ins; fixes garble in 2nd graf; also changes head) 
By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Newly released transcripts of secretly recorded
White House tapes show President Richard M. Nixon musing about
break-ins at foreign embassies, brainstorming about blaming
President John F. Kennedy for the murder of South Vietnam's leader,
and saying he and his aides would have been ``out of our minds''
not to spy on left-wing Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government murdered him,'' Nixon said of South Vietnamese
President Ngo Dihn Diem, whose assassination in November 1963
preceded Kennedy's by three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it and you know it, too,'' Nixon told his press
secretary in May 1973. But while one of Nixon's aides fabricated
evidence implicating Kennedy in the killing, there is no known
record of a presidential assassination order, although Kennedy
regretted giving tacit American approval to the coup that led to
Diem's death.
</P>
<P>
   In the transcripts, Nixon twice discusses authorizing break-ins
at foreign embassies. In May 1973, he told his military aide, Gen.
Alexander M. Haig, ``There are times, you know, when, good God, I'd
authorize any means to achieve a goal abroad'' _ including ``the
breaking-in of embassies and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   That same month, he told his legal aide, J. Fred Buzhardt,
``When we get down, for example, to the break-in, the Chilean
Embassy _ that thing was a part of the burglars' plan, as a cover .
. . a CIA cover.''
</P>
<P>
   The transcript appears to refer to a break-in at the Chilean
Embassy in Washington by Nixon's secret White House team, known as
the plumbers. That team conducted the June 1972 burglary at
Democratic Party offices in the Watergate complex, which led to
Nixon's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   A break-in at the Chilean Embassy in Washington on May 13, 1972,
was reported to Washington police. No link was made to the White
House at the time, and none has been made since.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always a rumor that the plumbers hit the Chilean
Embassy,'' John Dean, Nixon's White House counsel during the
Watergate affair, said in an interview on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dean said one of the plumbers, James W. McCord Jr., a former CIA
officer, was thought to have used his knowledge of American
espionage against the Chilean Embassy as a bargaining chip after
his conviction for the Watergate break-in. McCord, now 78, has
rarely spoken about Watergate and could not be reached on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy was a likely target for American intelligence
eavesdropping, since the CIA had been ordered by Nixon to help
destabilize the government of Salvador Allende Gossens, the freely
elected Marxist president of Chile, who fell in a coup led by Gen.
Augusto Pinochet in September 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The 124 transcripts made public on Thursday, some of them
fragments of a sentence, some several pages long, had been kept
secret on national security grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes, recorded on a White House system installed by Nixon,
were formally released by the National Archives on Thursday.
Transcripts were prepared by the privately financed Nixon Library
and made public on its Web site (www.nixonfoundation.org).
</P>
<P>
   The material is part of the 201 hours of White House tapes
identified by an act of Congress as evidence of Nixon's ``abuse of
power.'' Those tapes were kept from the public during 22 years of
litigation by Nixon and, after his death, by his estate. They are a
fraction of the 3,600 hours of tape recordings from the Nixon White
House that eventually will be made public.
</P>
<P>
   John H. Taylor, executive director of the Nixon Library in Yorba
Linda, Calif., said in an interview that the abuses of power with
which Nixon was charged should be understood in the context of the
times, more than a quarter-century ago, amid social skirmishes over
race and class and sex, political battles over the future of the
country and more than 50,000 Americans dead in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Nixon was a wartime commander in chief,'' Taylor said.
``We were in a culture war then. And what the culture tends to
remember as the domestic abuses of Watergate can only be understood
in the context of these challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon and his most senior aides spent hours discussing plans to
use federal law enforcement agencies and intelligence services to
conduct domestic spying operations against Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Nixon personally approved the most radical of these
plans. It was called ``the Huston plan,'' after its author, Tom
Charles Huston, a White House aide. J. Edgar Hoover, director of
the FBI, blocked its full implementation five days later. Dean, who
in 1973 decided to cooperate with federal investigators in the
Watergate case, took a copy of the Huston plan with him when he
left the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In the new transcripts, Nixon and his aides worry aloud about
the plan becoming public. One fragmentary transcript shows the
White House wondering if elements of the plan survived after Hoover
died in May 1972 and was succeeded by an acting FBI director loyal
to the Nixon White House, L. Patrick Gray.
</P>
<P>
   In the Oval Office on May 16, 1973, Buzhardt told Nixon about
his discussions with the deputy director of the National Security
Agency, Louis W. Tordella, about the Huston plan. The NSA conducts
international electronic eavesdropping, but like the CIA, it is not
supposed to spy on Americans at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything the NSA did is totally defensible,'' Nixon said,
referring to the Huston plan.
</P>
<P>
   Buzhardt replied: ``They move into a broader category with
respect to domestic affairs'' _ an illegal realm.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean?'' Nixon asked. ``Electronic surveillance?''
</P>
<P>
   Buzhardt replied, ``Yes, sir, targeting U.S. citizens'
conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon appeared unsure that the Huston plan had been turned off.
``DIA says that _ thinks it was terminated?'' he asked, referring
to the Defense Intelligence Agency, a Pentagon service that was
part of the Huston plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think it was terminated,'' Buzhardt said. ``Now, we're
going to check this thoroughly with NSA'' because ``they were the
most aggressive group.'' Referring to Tordella's notes on the
Huston plan, Buzhardt added: ``They never quite got a handle on it
until Pat Gray was appointed'' in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   In that same conversation, Nixon anticipated a story saying
``the president authorized a super-duper activity in 1970''
involving ``burglary, etc., and wiretapping.'' Defiantly, he said
Americans would understand the plan was to control riots by people
protesting the Vietnam War.

TELECOM ITALIA MOVES TO AVOID TAKEOVER BY OLIVETTI 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Telecom Italia's board took some decisive steps Thursday
to thwart a rejiggered $60 billion hostile takeover offer from its
domestic rival Olivetti SpA in what promises to be a rancorous
brawl for control of Italy's biggest phone company.
</P>
<P>
   Without formally rejecting the offer from Olivetti, the board
called the proposal seriously flawed, and it supported a strategy
proposed by the chairman of Telecom Italia, Franco Bernabe, who
said he was more focused on squeezing value out of the company than
brewing poison pills to protect it.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to Olivetti by Telecom Italia's board came after
several hours of meetings in Milan with Bernabe. The board asked
him to present it with an outline of the benefits of his plan,
which mainly calls for integrating Telecom Italia's fixed-line
operations with the mobile phone unit Telecom Italia Mobile, in
which it now holds a 60 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would increase Telecom Italia's net worth and raise
the price Olivetti would have to pay by several billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to show the board how we can create value for the
company,'' Bernabe said in an interview, ``with precise steps and
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti first proposed buying Telecom Italia over the weekend
with a $60 billion package of cash and securities that marked one
of the biggest hostile takeover attempts of any company. Italian
stock market regulators ruled the bid invalid, but Olivetti
submitted a revised offer on Wednesday in the hope that it would
satisfy regulatory objections before Telecom Italia could take
defensive steps.
</P>
<P>
   Under Italian takeover laws, a valid bid prevents a target
company from changing its capital structure. But Bernabe says his
idea to combine Telecom Italia with its mobile phone subsidiary
preceded Olivetti's offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to do anything that would look in any way like a
poison pill,'' Bernabe said. ``That only always hurts the company
very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy's stock market regulatory agency, known as Consob, now has
two weeks to rule whether Olivetti's revised bid is valid.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the price of Telecom Italia's American
depository receipts, which rose through the week in the hope that
Olivetti would sweeten its bid for Telecom Italia, fell 1.6 percent
Thursday, to $107.9375.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecom Italia board said in a statement that Olivetti's
renewed bid was ``full of holes in numerous aspects,'' including,
among other things, the antitrust implications of a bid by Telecom
Italia's major domestic competitor, the characteristics and quality
of its financing, the indebtedness it would produce and the absence
of an industrial plan and clear time frame.
</P>
<P>
   The board said it wanted to hear Olivetti's intentions in an
industrial plan with particular reference to Telecom Italia Mobile.
</P>
<P>
   It empowered Bernabe to seek clarification from Consob of the
validity of the renewed Olivetti bid without delay, including
clarification of the effects on Telecom Italia's freedom to act.
The ball is now clearly in Consob's court.
</P>
<P>
   The board also told Bernabe to present an industrial plan with
the ``synergy effects and creation of value'' that would arise from
the integration of Telecom Italia and its mobile phone unit.
</P>
<P>
   It said it would rigorously study Olivetti's proposals, taking
as the sole yardstick ``the interests of the shareholders of the
company and the maximization of the company's value.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Olivetti's bid, Bernabe said, did not hurt his ability to
formulate an industrial plan for the board, or to summon a
shareholder meeting for its approval. ``The only thing Olivetti
changes is the pace,'' he said. ``Subjectively, what happened is
that everybody in the company feels threatened, and is much more
willing to accept change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In normal times, it's always a lengthy process,'' he added.
``These are not normal times.''
</P>
<P>
   That was driven home late Thursday, when rumors circulated in
Milan that Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. might be considering support
for Olivetti in its hostile bid.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors were fueled by the presence of investment bankers on
the Olivetti team who had recently advised Murdoch in an
unsuccessful effort to join Telecom Italia's Stream digital
television unit in a pay-for-view project. Murdoch lost interest
after the Italian government limited how much soccer, the engine
for pay-TV revenue in Europe, the station could sign up.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch uses soccer as the ramrod for his European television
ventures. Support for Olivetti could afford Murdoch another shot at
Stream, the reasoning went.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman in London for the News Corp. would not comment on
the reports.

THE PLAYER WITH JORDAN'S NUMBER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds. see also GLF-MATCH)  By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD , Calif. _ Michael Jordan's number, 23, is on Shigeki
Maruyama's golf bag. He bought it two years ago at the Michael
Jordan store in Chicago. The cheerful Japanese golfer called it one
of his happiest moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought my shoes and clothing and I ate a cheeseburger
there,'' he said through an interpreter. ``It was delicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Did you get to meet Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I have never met him,'' he said, ``but I am desperate to
meet him.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is Jordan's number on your golf bag?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I became a pro, I was 23,'' said Maruyama, now 29. He
noted, Jordan also turned pro in his early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I really feel close when I hear about him and his
interviews,'' he said. ``I really feel close to him because of the
different reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   How many strokes would you give Jordan in golf? ``Handicap?'' he
said. ``Half, 5. Total, 10.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship moved into
the third round, Loren Roberts might wish he could get a stroke or
two from Maruyama, who had six birdies Thursday in a 4-and-2
elimination of Justin Leonard, the 1997 British Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shigeki's the best player in Japan and he's played great all
over the world,'' Leonard said later. ``So it would be hard to call
what happened an upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Maruyama, who is 5 feet 7 inches and 185 pounds, burst into the
golf world's consciousness two months ago in the Presidents Cup in
Australia, winning all five of his matches for the International
team, including a 3-and-2 triumph over John Huston in the singles.
</P>
<P>
   As No. 42 in the world golf ranking, Maruyama easily qualified
for this first of three World Golf Championship events this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is checking the rankings,'' Davis Love III, who was
No. 4, said not long ago, ``to see who's going to draw Maruyama.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Steve Stricker, No. 23, drew Maruyama and
lost, 3 and 2, in Wednesday's opening round before Leonard, who is
No. 10, lost Thursday. Of the world's top 10 ranked players, only
Tiger Woods, No. 1, is among the 16 survivors after the departure
of David Duval, Vijay Singh, Nick Price and Leonard Thursday. If
Maruyama were to defeat Roberts, No. 30, Friday morning and then
the Bill Glasson-Andrew Magee winner in the afternoon, he suddenly
would be in Saturday's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to play match play a lot when I was in the university,
and also when I became a pro,'' he said. ``I won the Japan Match
Play. I have lots of confidence. I really love match play.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``Two points,'' he said. ``The first is, I can focus, just
one person, instead of worrying about the whole big tournament. It
is just concentrating, fighting with one person, and I like that
concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other is, in each hole, the result comes up right away.
So, when I make a mistake or something, I can just switch into
gearing up for the next hole and I can change my mood and just keep
going playing.''
</P>
<P>
   What would it mean if he were to win a tournament in the United
States?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would mean a lot to me,'' he said, ``because the reason I
wanted to become a pro is when I saw Tom Watson winning the Masters
in 1981, and it just has that much closer meaning to me and how I
decided to become a pro.''
</P>
<P>
   How recognized is Maruyama in Japan?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot more Japanese people are interested in baseball than in
golf,'' he said. ``So unless I win really big-time, it is not going
to mean that much. I don't really care how I am going to be
recognized in Japan. At this point, it really means a lot to me and
my self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   But considering his success, should the American golf pros fear
Maruyama?
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem,'' he said. ``I want everyone to think I am a
really funny guy.''

BELLE SPEAKS, AND HAS SOMETHING TO SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Much has been made over the years as
Albert Belle has unleashed his wicked bat and vile temper on
baseball about his unwillingness to talk to reporters. Belle had a
22-minute conversation with reporters Thursday , but he actually
demonstrated his respect for them, or at least for their job, by
not talking.
</P>
<P>
   Eight times during the session in the Baltimore Orioles' dugout
at Fort Lauderdale Stadium, Belle interrupted his responses to
questions with silence while private planes flew overhead after
taking off from an adjacent airport.
</P>
<P>
   He could have kept talking, but he knew no one would hear him so
he waited until the planes passed, pausing from 6 seconds to 36
seconds in the interest of accommodating the people he sometimes
seems to love to hate.
</P>
<P>
   Few people other than reporters care if Belle speaks to them,
but when he did talk Thursday, Belle showed a side of himself that
fans seldom get to see. Who knew, for instance, that he has a sense
of humor?
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple years ago,'' he said, discussing fan treatment of
him, ``we were home in Chicago playing against the Astros. I guess
it must have been a Houston fan. He told me I was one hot dog away
from being Cecil Fielder. I got the biggest laugh out of that. I
don't know where he got that from.''
</P>
<P>
   Belle actually enjoyed telling the story. He also visibly
enjoyed his answers to a couple of questions.
</P>
<P>
   How has he been treated at Camden Yards when he has played
against the Orioles there?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been treated there just like I've been treated everywhere
else. You got everybody booing for you.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the difference between playing left field, where he has
almost always played, and right field, where he will play for the
Orioles?
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a shorter run in Camden Yards from the dugout to right
field. There will be less fans there because of the high wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Belle imparted those lines following his first official spring
workout with his new team, the third in his career, the one that
lured him during his limited free agency by offering $65 million
for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and the Boston Red Sox were the other teams
interested in the highly productive outfielder, who became a free
agent because his contract with the Chicago White Sox no longer
made him one of baseball's three highest-paid players.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Orioles were his first choice and he had rejected
the Yankees and the Red Sox after weighing the ``advantages and
disadvantages'' of each team. But here Belle reverted closer to
form. When he was asked how close he came to signing with the
Yankees before the Orioles jumped in with their offer, he said,
``Let's see. That happened back in 1998 and this is 1999. I pretty
much have forgotten what happened in '98, so I couldn't tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened, to refresh his memory, was Belle and his advisers
decided Baltimore would be a less threatening place to play than
New York. Although Belle has remained out of trouble recently,
avoiding off-field encounters like trying to run down Halloween
pranksters with his car, he apparently remains susceptible. New
York fans have a well-earned reputation for making life difficult
for players, especially if they falter. Ask Ed Whitson, if anyone
can find him.
</P>
<P>
   Belle, whose 313 home runs are the most anyone has hit in the
past eight seasons, has been a notoriously slow starter, finding
cold weather an environment in which baseball should not be played.
Last April and May he hit 10 home runs and drove in 40 runs. He
finished the season with 49 and 152. Baltimore, he speculated,
should be better for him because the weather should be warmer.
</P>
<P>
   Camden Yards should help, too, because it is a home run park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like it should,'' Belle said, ``but that depends on
how well the guys around me are performing. If the guys around me
get on base and protect me in the lineup, I should have a pretty
good season.''
</P>
<P>
   Good enough to hit 70 home runs? ``Everything has to go right
for me to hit 50 homers, let alone 70,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added later when asked about his image, the better he
hits the better his image will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really concerned about my image right now,'' he said.
``I can't control that anymore. I'm not going to try to. When you
win a lot more games than you lose, the image tends to get better.
If you hit tons of home runs and drive in tons of runs, the image
gets better.''
</P>
<P>
   A few jokes could help, too. &QL;

the lines at soup kitchens and food pantries across America. Some
are the welfare-to-work versions of an old phenomenon: the working
poor caught in the middle _ too well off for public assistance but
not well enough off to make it on their own. Some are immigrants
who are here legally but were cut off from food stamps under new
federal welfare laws. Some are following a path of least

outlets turning into travel agents, it is hard to find a source of
information that does not have a financial stake in what its users
do with what the source publishes. Trusting an Internet site to

   EPIDEMIC-EXHIBIT (New York) _ There's something about deadly
epidemics that both terrifies and fascinates people. One of the
best attended exhibitions ever mounted by the New York's American
Museum of Natural History was a six-week show in 1908. After a long
absence, germs are back at the museum. This weekend a new
exhibition will open in which dozens of infectious-disease
organisms will strut their stuff as computer animations,
eye-catching models, microphotographs, dioramas, and even real (but
dead) disease microorganisms. It is called ``Epidemic! The World of
Infectious Disease,'' and in this viewer's estimation, it is the
most impressive and informative exhibition the museum has mounted
in years. By Malcolm W. Browne.

ATROCITY FINDINGS: `THE HISTORIC FACTS MUST BE RECOGNIZED' 
</HEADLINE>
   (With GUATEMALA-WAR-REPORT)  
(bl) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY _ Following are excerpts from a statement
Thursday by Christian Tomuschat, coordinator of the Historical
Clarification Commission, on atrocities during the Guatemalan civil
war:
</P>
<P>
   The commission has been able to establish that state forces and
allied paramilitary groups were responsible for 93 percent of the
documented violations, that the insurgent forces were responsible
for 3 percent and that the remaining 4 percent of the cases include
other authors. . .
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude and inhuman irrationality of this violent scourge
that Guatemala suffered for more than three decades cannot be
explained simply as a consequence of a confrontation between two
armed parties.
</P>
<P>
   We have reached the conclusion that the structure and nature of
the economic, cultural and social relationships in Guatemala, as
well as racism, the closing of spaces for participation and the
refusal by the state to promote substantive reform, were all
factors that determined the origin and the outbreak of the armed
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   We have also been able to demonstrate the participation, by
various means, of economically powerful groups, political parties,
the churches and people at the universities, as well as of other
sectors of civil society.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the commission has concluded that the fundamental
reasons for the Guatemalan armed confrontation cannot be reduced to
the simplistic logic of two armed factions. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, foreign governments often became involved in
Guatemala's internal affairs, and in so doing they contributed to
the resolve and perseverance of the armed confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's investigations demonstrate that until the
mid-1980's, the United States Government and U.S. private companies
exercised pressure to maintain the country's archaic and unjust
socio-economic structure. In addition, the United States
Government, through its constituent structures, including the
Central Intelligence Agency, lent direct and indirect support to
some illegal state operations. At the same time, the commission has
information regarding the support given by the Cuban Government to
the guerrilla organizations, including military training for
combatants. . . .
</P>
<P>
   During a large part of the internal armed confrontation, and
believing that the ends justified everything, the military and the
state security forces blindly pursued the anti-Communist struggle,
without respect for any legal principles or the most elemental
ethical and religious values, and in this way completely lost any
semblance of human morals. . . .
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of a thorough investigation, and taking into
account the definitions contained in the Convention on the
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the commission
concludes, with great consternation, that within the framework of
the counterinsurgency operations carried out between 1981 and 1983,
in certain regions of the country, agents of the Guatemalan state
committed acts of genocide against groups of the Mayan people. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla groups also committed acts of violence that
violated the right to life by means of arbitrary executions
directed against the civilian population or defenseless
individuals, some of them connected to the confrontation in the
cases of military commissioners and members of the civilian
patrols. The commission has proved that guerrilla groups were also
responsible for the arbitrary execution of some members of their
own organizations. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Having concluded that genocide was committed, the commission
also concludes that _ without prejudice to the fact that the
participants in the crime include both the material and
intellectual authors of the acts of genocide committed in Guatemala
_ there also exists responsibility by the state.
</P>
<P>
   This responsibility emanates from the fact that the majority of
these acts were the product of a policy pre-established at a high
command level hierarchically superior to the direct perpetrators.
The state also failed to comply with its obligation to investigate
and punish the acts of genocide committed within its territory. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   No one can today insure that (the) immense challenge of
reconciliation through truth can be met with success. In order to
do so, the historic facts must be recognized and assimilated into
each individual consciousness and the collective consciousness. The
country's future depends in great part on the response of the state
and society to the tragedies suffered in flesh and blood by the
immense majority of Guatemalan families.

SHADES OF DEMOCRATS, BUT IS AD FROM REPUBLICANS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thursday's pop quiz: Was this full-page newspaper
advertisement the handiwork of the Democratic or Republican Party?
</P>
<P>
   In the advertisement, addressed to the American people, readers
are told: ``We are committed to saving Social Security for today's
seniors, tomorrow's baby boomers and for their children. As
important as Social Security is for the nation's retirees, we also
need to create the world's best schools for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in a nod to blue-collar voters, the advertisement says,
``Our plan to ease the tax burden will put more money in the
pockets of middle-class Americans so they can provide more for
their families, while making government less wasteful and more
efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   With its Democratic buzzwords and its photographs of an
African-American family, an elderly couple, a female teacher and a
man in a military uniform, the advertisement looks and sounds like
it came out of the White House public relations' shop _ or from the
Democratic leadership in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise, surprise. The advertisement was signed by Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott and House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and
paid for by the Republican National Committee. It appeared Tuesday
in USA Today, and the party sent it in the form of a ``letter to
the editor'' to hundreds of newspapers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The ``open letter'' is the latest demonstration of how
Republicans are trying to repair their image after impeachment and
to strike an accommodating tone with the public, and perhaps even
with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even some Republicans in the capital are grousing that the
advertisement may as well have featured a white flag rather than an
American flag in the background.
</P>
<P>
   On virtually every issue cited _ from the budget to welfare
reform to crime to Social Security to education _ polls show that
the public now trusts Democrats as much as or more than
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite a departure,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, who allowed that he _ happily _ could have signed the
advertisement. ``Some are saying, `Two or three years ago, we would
have paid for an ad to run like that in the early Gingrich days.'''
</P>
<P>
   James Carville, President Clinton's sharp-tongued political
adviser, put it this way: ``There's not one thing in that ad that
I'm not vehemently for. There's maybe a little too much class
warfare even for me. The reverse would be the Democrats running an
ad saying, `The burden of regulation is stifling economic growth in
America. And the tax code is so complicated that there are more
words in it than the Bible and the Koran put together.'''
</P>
<P>
   Deriding such critics, Mike Collins, a spokesman for the
Republican Party, said, ``Since when do Democrats have a monopoly
on working people? They're the ones who have been taxing working
men and women 40 percent of their income. This ad was a way for the
Republicans to ratify to the American people _ as we did in '94 _
what we were sent here to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement was hatched by Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., the
new chairman of the House Republican Conference, who took the idea
to Hastert, who then took it to Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Carville's critique spurred Lauren Maddox, Watts' spokeswoman,
to ask: ``Is James really going to join our party? The door's
always open.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidding aside, the advertisement unnerved conservatives who for
years have accused Clinton and the Democrats of appropriating their
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying message,'' said William Pascoe, political
director of the American Conservative Union, ``is: `We want to be
bipartisan. We're not just the party of impeachment.' But I don't
know that we have any issues left to drive wedges into the
Democratic coalition. Nobody has a clue as to an agenda that will
light a fire under the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement does contain clues that it was the work of
Republicans. It offers more praise, for example, for the
Republican-controlled Congress than for the Democratic White House.
``Congress has succeeded in implementing policies that work for the
American people,'' it says. And it calls for strengthening the
military, asserting, ``Shrinking defense resources have worn down
our equipment and hurt troop morale.'' (But even in their oratory,
Democrats like to toss in a line now and then about the importance
of a vigorous defense.)
</P>
<P>
   Daschle was more concerned about what was NOT in the
advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there are a lot of omissions,'' he said. ``They
don't have some of the other things that we would want to protect
Medicare, patient's bill of rights, minimum wage, campaign finance
reform. But clearly the agenda that they've articulated is one that
we're very excited about _ and have been pushing for years, if not
decades.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jorge Martinez, who works for a Republican consulting firm
that put the finishing touches on the advertisement, warned that
Democrats had better not gloat. ``They're jealous, of course,'' he
said, ``because they didn't think of it.''

THE YANKEENETS: A MARRIAGE MADE WITH TELEVISION IN MIND
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a year of steady and serious courtship, the New
York Yankees and the New Jersey Nets announced their plan Thursday
to merge into a company called the YankeeNets and promised that
each team would continue to operate separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Steinbrenner has made it clear that he won't run the
Nets,'' said his spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, who spoke for both
teams when the owners decided against talking to the news media.
``If he's asked his opinion, he'll give it.''
</P>
<P>
   A definitive agreement has not been signed. The teams signed a
letter of intent to create the YankeeNets, in which each team will
be equal partners in a company designed to maximize the sale of
local cable television rights, sponsorships, luxury suites, tickets
and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   To create their 50-50 partnership, the teams will exchange some
stock and the Nets owners will contribute at least $350 million
from outside investors.
</P>
<P>
   One source of capital is to come from a group led by Allen and
Co., an investment firm that is renowned for its entertainment
industry deals. A second source of money could be Tishman Speyer
Properties, the real estate developer.
</P>
<P>
   Donald R. Keough, the chairman of Allen and Co., and Jerry I.
Speyer, the president of Tishman Speyer, were named to the
YankeeNets board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are 14 individual owners or ownership groups that
control two or more teams in the four major sports, including Time
Warner (the Atlanta Braves, Hawks and the NHL expansion Thrashers),
the Walt Disney Co. (the Anaheim Angels and Mighty Ducks) and Mike
Ilitch (the Detroit Tigers and Red Wings) this is the first
instance of two teams merging into one company.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the expansion of multiple-team ownership has
occurred less for sporting reasons than for television and
marketing advantages. Ultimately, it may not matter that the Nets
have not won a championship since 1976, when they were in the
American Basketball Association, and have started the
lockout-shortened season with a spate of injuries and a 2-9 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record is temporary,'' Rubenstein said. ``They have very
good ballplayers. With the drive these owners have, the Nets will
be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The news that the champion Yankees would combine with the Nets,
a team with a far less hallowed history, stunned Roy C. Boe, who
bought the Nets for about $100,000 in 1969 and owned them until
1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow!'' Boe said from his home in Connecticut. ``Holy smokes!
This is mind-boggling. I'm shocked they kept it a secret. It's hard
to imagine the Yankees would merge with the Nets, but there must be
things we aren't aware of yet.''
</P>
<P>
   He speculated that Steinbrenner sees the wisdom in linking up
with a NBA team, even after the lockout and despite the Nets not
having the marquee value of the Knicks, Los Angeles Lakers or
Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA has made such incredible strides here and around the
world,'' said Boe, who sold Julius Erving in 1976 before the Nets
joined the NBA
</P>
<P>
   The main benefits of the merger for the Yankees seem to be the
cash infusion from the new investors and the leverage a second team
could create in talks to renew the teams' cable television deals
with Cablevision's local sports channels: the MSG Network, which
carries Yankees games, and Fox Sports New York, the Nets' channel.
</P>
<P>
   The YankeeNets could also form their own sports channel or make
a deal with ESPN or Time Warner to create a channel to compete with
Cablevision.
</P>
<P>
   But what the creation of the YankeeNets makes apparent _ at
least for the forseeable future _ is the death of talks with
Cablevision to buy the Yankees, talks which had broken down last
November.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, James Dolan, Cablevision's president, said in a
statement: ``Cablevision has enjoyed a longstanding, productive
relationship with both organizations and we look forward to
continuing those relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Those relationships could end soon. The Yankees' MSG deal ends
after next season and the Nets' contract concludes after the
2001-02 season. If the Yankees leave, MSG could be badly hurt,
without crucial, highly rated spring and summer programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had Cablevision bought the Yankees, they could have linked
them up with the Knicks and Rangers, which would have been a better
package than the Yankees-Nets,'' said Jeff Phillips, a vice
president at Houlihan Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin, a Chicago investment
bank that specializes in sports finance. Cablevision's ownership of
Madison Square Garden includes the Knicks, the Rangers and the
arena.

 NEW YORK: the arena.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The talks between the Yankees and Nets began about a year ago
when Steinbrenner, during meetings with Jerry L. Cohen, a member of
the old and new Nets ownership groups, spoke about ``the potentials
of the two clubs,'' Rubenstein said. Some of those talks were
television-related, as Steinbrenner sought a way to build leverage
with Cablevision, said one executive with knowledge of the early
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein said Steinbrenner ``was not negotiating in two places
at once'' and described the early Nets talks as ``casual and
friendly.'' With the apparent demise of the Yankees' talks with
Cablevision, serious negotiations began between Steinbrenner and
the Nets' new owners, including Raymond Chambers and Lewis Katz,
who took over control of the team in late October after paying $150
million.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers' and Katz's 38 percent ownership share of the Nets
belongs to a charitable trust that has said it will funnel all its
profits toward inner-city youth programs in New Jersey. The trust,
the Community Youth Organization, will remain in place and will own
20 percent of the YankeeNets. Bill Cosby, the entertainer, is a
team investor and chairman of the trust.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Steinbrenner said ``over and above the obvious
business reasons for the partnering of the two teams, I was moved
by the Nets' commitment to youth.'' Although it was not announced,
the Nets' charitable efforts are expected to be extended to areas
of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein was unable to say precisely what impact, if any, the
merger of the teams will have on the Yankees' pursuit of a new home
in Manhattan or New Jersey, or whether they will stay in the Bronx
at a new or renovated stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steinbrenner is retaining all options, including New Jersey,''
Rubenstein said, adding that Steinbrenner is intrigued about
whether the South Bronx area surrounding Yankee Stadium could
become an empowerment zone, which would make it eligible for
federal assistance. ``If a lot can be done to rehabilitate the
neighborhood, not just put in a new stadium, he'd be very
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, meanwhile, have proposed moving to a new arena in
downtown Newark from Continental Airlines Arena in the Meadowlands
Sports Complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think this will affect the Nets-Newark proposal or
our plans to redevelop the Continental Arena,'' said John Samerjan,
a spokesman for the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, the
arena's owner. ``And we haven't taken action on the baseball front
in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein offered a ``no comment'' when asked whether the
YankeeNets might sell stock in an initial public offering. Shares
in the Boston Celtics, Cleveland Indians and Florida Panthers are
now publicly traded.
</P>
<P>
   With teams from two sports combined into one entity, Andrew
Zimbalist, a professor of economics at Smith College, cautioned,
``It's possible that Steinbrenner could shift revenues around to
avoid additional revenue sharing in baseball or even shift around
some NBA revenues.''

HOUSE GROUP SEEKS CHANGE IN CAMPAIGN FINANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Republicans struggling behind the scenes to
assemble a post-impeachment agenda, a bipartisan group of House
members took advantage of the lull Thursday and called on the new
speaker to allow a vote early this year on a bill to overhaul the
nation's campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what we have been through with impeachment and,
preceding impeachment, the scandals, the campaign financing
scandals of the last presidential campaign in both parties,'' said
Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., ``this is the kind of legislation we
need.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and
Martin Meehan, D-Mass., seeks to cut down on the influence of money
in politics. It would ban the unlimited and largely unregulated
donations to political parties that have been increasingly used to
circumvent the limits enacted after Watergate on contributions to
individual candidates. And it would curb independent groups from
running issue advocacy commercials attacking or supporting a
candidate within 60 days of an election.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in both houses adamantly oppose the measure,
and the new speaker, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, has given no
sign that he is any more supportive of it than was his predecessor,
Newt Gingrich. He has committed only to a vote sometime during the
106th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't give a date certain,'' Hastert said Wednesday, ``but
I gave my word that it would be on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   But his spokesman, John Feehery, gave a strong hint that it
would be put on the back burner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some things that are higher priority right now,''
Feehery said, ``the budget, saving Social Security, providing for
the national defense and tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the House sponsors had to face down several obstacles
before they pulled off an improbable victory, passing the bill
252-179, with the support of 61 Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Although Shays and Meehan prevailed, the measure died in a
filibuster in the Senate. Opponents say the bill violates
constitutional guarantees of free speech and weakens political
parties. It would also eat into the Republicans' traditional
advantage in fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   The House sponsors want a vote early this year, to allow
political pressure to build on the Senate, as well as to try to put
the changes in place for the 2000 presidential election, which is
already getting under way.
</P>
<P>
   Shays said the political parties raised $75 million in
unregulated, or soft money, donations in 1992. The sums increased
to $262 million in the 1996 presidential year. And he said the
projections are the parties could raise $500 million to $700
million in the next Presidential cycle.
</P>
<P>
   To press Hastert, the sponsors are turning to Rep. Zach Wamp,
R-Tenn., to try to win over conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a fiscal and social conservative,'' Wamp said. ``I plan to
be out there again trying to recruit people who think like me and
vote like me.''
</P>
<P>
   If that fails, conservative Democrats are prepared to gather
signatures on a petition to force the bill to the floor _ the
tactic that led Republican leaders to relent last year.

OFFICERS IN 41-BULLET SHOOTING MAY NOT ALL USE SAME DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They are locked together as a group by the fact that
they fired 41 bullets at an unarmed man. But the four police
officers involved in the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo may end up
employing very different defense strategies, legal experts say.
</P>
<P>
   In their defense, the officers have already said through a union
lawyer that they mistakenly thought that Diallo, a 22-year-old
street peddler, was reaching for a weapon, causing them to shoot at
him.
</P>
<P>
   But, based on preliminary indications of where the officers were
standing when the shooting began, it is doubtful all four had a
clear view of any sudden gestures that Diallo might have made in
the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, while at least one of the officers will likely say
he fired because he thought Diallo was going for a gun, others may
well argue that they opened fire largely because they saw a
colleague shoot and concluded that he must have been in mortal
danger, the legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a legitimate argument,'' said Joseph Tacopina, a
lawyer who often represents police officers. ``When your brother
officer releases a round, although you don't see a gun, you don't
have time to say, `Hey, Johnnie. Did you see something?' You have
to act instantaneously.''
</P>
<P>
   By making such an argument, the officers would be relying on a
section of the New York State Penal Law that allows a person to use
deadly physical force if he or she reasonably believes that another
person's life is in imminent danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reasonably'' is the important word in the law: the officers
would have to be convincing in arguing that it was reasonable for
them to fire, or to fire so many times, at Diallo because another
officer had begun shooting. Even Police Commissioner Howard Safir
has said that the number of shots fired, ``on its face, seems
excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Chevigny, a New York University law professor who is the
author of ``Edge of the Knife: Police Violence in the Americas''
(1995, New Press), said: ``Does the fact that another cop was
firing give the cop a reason to believe that that cop is acting in
self-defense or that the suspect is threatening? I don't think it
does. The mere fact that someone else is firing by itself is not
grounds to open fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have yet to determine who fired the first shot at
Diallo. But they do have some idea of the circumstances of the
shooting. Based on the location of spent bullet shells,
investigators think that Officer Sean Carroll was standing
alongside Officer Edward McMellon on the outside stairs to Diallo's
building when the shooting began. Both officers fired all 16 rounds
from their 9-mm semiautomatic weapons. The other two officers,
Richard Murphy and Kenneth Boss, are thought to have been farther
back, near the curb, when the shooting began, and they fired four
and five shots, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   One factor that could support the idea that the officers thought
a colleague was in danger would be whether one of the officers fell
during the shooting, creating the misimpression that he had been
hit by gunfire. Lawyers who have heard the officers' accounts of
the shooting have said that McMellon fell during the encounter with
Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a police officer is working with another police officer and
a weapon is fired and one police officer goes down, that is
certainly probable cause for an officer to believe he's in
danger,'' said Marvyn Kornberg, a lawyer for Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   None of the experts interviewed could recall a case in which
officers have argued that they opened fire primarily because they
saw a fellow officer begin shooting and felt he was in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the Diallo case, none of the possible explanations
of why some of the officers joined in the shooting help explain why
one officer opened fire to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   All of the officers are awaiting the decision of a Bronx grand
jury investigating the shooting, which, if it brings an indictment,
will most likely consider charges ranging from second-degree murder
to criminally negligent homicide. Kornberg has already said he
expects his client, Officer Carroll, to be indicted and therefore
will not have him testify before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   That announcement came as a surprise to the other officers, who
have not announced their intentions about testifying, and was
another indication that the officers' individual legal concerns
might ultimately prod them into divergent legal strategies. The
decision on whether to testify may be considerably harder for other
officers. One of them, Murphy, who preliminary tests indicate may
have missed Diallo with all four shots he fired, may want to get
his side of the story before the grand jury, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   It is still possible that several of the officers will work out
a joint defense agreement.
</P>
<P>
   As their individual interests diverge, the officers may find it
difficult to maintain the unified front they have so far, the
experts said, especially because they were not regular partners
whose social friendships provided added cement to their
professional bonds.

BERTKA HAS BRIEF STINT AT HELM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ By this evening, Larry Drew or Kurt Rambis will be the
acting head coach of the Lakers, provided with a brief, 37-game
schedule to change the team's fortunes and perhaps enhance his own.
</P>
<P>
   That decision was being made by Lakers owner Jerry Buss,
executive Jerry West and general manager Mitch Kupchak late
Thursday and due to be announced this morning. Whichever of the two
Lakers assistants, Drew or Rambis, is hired, he will finish out the
season and have the chance to win the job permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Either choice is fine with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect Kurt as a coach, definitely,'' Corie Blount said.
``To me, he always gives you that confidence, that no matter what
happens, stay ready. Whoever gets the job, it's not really gonna
matter, because we know what we have to do now.''
</P>
<P>
   But for one night, it was the Bill Bertka era again. It's an era
comprising not years but short spurts of hours and days spread over
two-plus decades.
</P>
<P>
   A 26-year assistant coach in the NBA, Bertka has had his brief
moments in the spotlight, filling in occasionally for both the New
Orleans Jazz and the Lakers. He figures he's coached probably a
dozen games when coaches took ill or were ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's game was just his third, however, as the acting head
coach, an event that comes only after a firing. His lifetime
record: 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my opportunities earlier in my career,'' Bertka said of
taking a head coach position (he did serve as head coach at Kent
State and Hancock College, and has operated, with his wife, one of
the best scouting services for college coaches).
</P>
<P>
   But he wanted to keep his home in Santa Barbara, and he enjoyed
the closer relationship with players that assistant coaches have.
</P>
<P>
   For one night, once again, Bertka played the part of substitute
teacher, with a classroom of students on the verge of academic
probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the most challenging aspect is to get them on the right
mental train at this point,'' he said. ``I know that the players
want to get this thing turned around and they're in a challenging
situation right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Worm watch: Even as a signed-and-delivered Laker, Dennis Rodman
was deemed too much a distraction to have in the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt if he wasn't going to play, people would be asking why
he isn't playing,'' Lakers spokesman John Black said. ``Because of
the circus atmosphere following him everywhere he goes, it would be
a distraction for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman is said to be in shape but needed another day of learning
the Lakers' system before playing. He participated in Thursday's
morning shootaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks as fit as anybody,'' Bertka said. ``Obviously, the
guy's a remarkable athlete.''

NET GAME PLAN: ASSISTS TO COMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lewis Katz stepped into the world of professional sports last
fall, making idealistic proclamations of social good and community
uplift. At a time when the National Basketball Association was
embroiled in a labor dispute that sullied the public's perception
of its players and owners, Katz was emerging as a welcomed, if
somewhat hard-to-believe, champion of altruism as the new managing
owner and co-chairman of the New Jersey Nets.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of donating nearly 40 percent of the team's profits to
social-service programs that benefited inner-city youth, of moving
the Nets to a new arena in Newark, N.J., to revitalize business and
hope in that decaying urban center, and of utilizing his franchise
as a platform for solving urban ills through private enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after Thursday's announcement that the Nets plan to merge
with the powerful and storied New York Yankees, the platform and
possibilities have grown tremendously, raising the questions as to
just who is Lewis Katz and what are his motivations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in ownership to get richer,'' said Katz, previously
the controlling stockholder of Kinney Parking Systems. ``We want to
bring not only a championship to the franchise, but to elevate it
to reaching a higher good in terms of improving the quality of
people's lives. We have enough money. What we may not have is
enough time to try to help solve the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz, 57, solved a burgeoning problem for his noble intentions
by partnering the Nets with the Yankees. Instead of having nearly
40 percent of the struggling Nets' profits _ if there are any
profits _ go into his social- service endeavors, he will be in
position to donate 20 percent of the profits of the much more
lucrative YankeeNets, the new company being formed by the two
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Camden, N.J., Katz became involved with the Nets
through his friend, Ray Chambers, a well-known New Jersey
philanthropist who shuns the attention of the news media and
declined interview requests for this article. Last year, when the
Nets were on the verge of being sold and relocated to Long Island,
Chambers put together 15 investors to purchase two-thirds of the
Nets for $150 million. The desire was to keep the team in New
Jersey and perhaps ignite a new trend in professional sports
ownership, in which at least some profits could be used for social
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers and Katz each invested $25 million into the Nets and
then donated their 38 percent stake in the team to their newly
formed Community Youth Organization, a nonprofit trust dedicated to
assisting inner-city youth in the moribund cities of Newark,
Camden, Paterson, Trenton and Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   So while the other owners of the Nets hope to receive a return
on their investments, particularly now that the Nets and Yankees
are merging, Chambers and Katz will not, because whatever profit
they realize will go to the CYO.
</P>
<P>
   The CYO will provide such services as scholarships, tutorial
programs, nutritional programs and possibly even housing renovation
and health care in New Jersey's inner-city neighborhoods. And now
that the Nets are joining with the Yankees, the CYO's efforts will
almost undoubtedly extend into the South Bronx neighborhood around
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be so wonderful if we could start a trend,'' said
Katz, who in conjunction with Chambers has pledged to donate
$200,000 a year to the CYO if there are no profits. ``Most guys
that own teams probably aren't in need of money. And we think that
because sports is a high-visibility business, it just offers more
to kids, and maybe the message even gets to the players _ that
sports doesn't just have to be about winning and money.''
</P>
<P>
   Such high-minded claims become easy targets from cynics. Even
Michael Rowe, the Nets president since 1995, admitted to having
doubts when first informed of the new owners' intentions. ``I was
originally skeptical that this was not the real world of the NBA or
professional sports,'' Rowe said. ``But the more time I spent with
them, the more I thought, `Why not?'''
</P>
<P>
   Last January, Bill Cosby, an old friend of Katz's when they
attended Temple University in the '60s, invested several million
dollars in the Nets to join the fold as an adviser to the CYO. In
addition to providing a vision and direction for the program, Cosby
hopes to help professional athletes better manage their finances
and project a more positive image off the court. One person
familiar with Cosby's concerns said: ``He's tired of waking up and
reading about NBA players spending their money irresponsibly and
having all of these children out of wedlock. He wants to help them
avoid anything that might be a negative influence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come into this to own human beings,'' Cosby said from
a courtside seat at a Nets game last week. ``These young men have a
chance to be very conservative with their money and then set goals
of helping themselves and helping others. That's the ideal that we
hope to bring to the Nets and the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Cosby and Katz met while working at Temple in a coat room and
hit it off immediately because both were aspiring comedians. They
teamed up to start a free weekly concert series called ``The Hour
of Pleasure,'' but because their budget was so sparse, they would
often advertise fictitious acts and then have Cosby perform his
comedy routine. ``'They would say, `Sorry, the act canceled at the
last minute, but Temple's own Bill Cosby's going to entertain
you,''' said Drew Katz, Lewis' son.
</P>
<P>
   Cosby and Katz also bonded over sports. Cosby played on Temple's
football team and ran on the track team, and Katz, according to his
boyhood friend, Richard Riggs, ``always hung around the athletes.''
While growing up poor in Camden, Katz's favorite sport was
basketball. His mother was widowed when he was an infant and he
tells of how athletes became his role models to fill the void in
his life from not having a father. He recalls pretending to be Paul
Arizin of the Philadelphia Warriors while playing on the
dirt-and-gravel court near his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that basketball did for me in terms of
values was that it taught me sportsmanship, honest competition and
at the same time, gave my life some purpose, `' said Katz, who
played one year at Camden High School. ``I really looked forward to
seeing Boston and Philly play the night before Thanksgiving. You
grew up identifying with the hometown team.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Katz is so intent on moving the Nets to Newark. He
believes that bringing a team back to the inner city will provide
not only an economic boon for the area but inspiration to the
neighborhood's children, many of whom are growing up fatherless as
he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about all those residents who will wake up one day and
say, `My God, somebody really cared enough to bring back an NBA
team to my city,' '' Katz said. ``Think about the self-esteem that
comes from identifying with that. I know, because that's how it was
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer who once served as the finance chairman for New
Jersey's Democratic Party, he struck gold by buying and reviving
Kinney Parking Systems. Last year, he sold the company to Central
Parking for $225 million.
</P>
<P>
   That enabled him to enter what he calls ``the third chapter'' of
his life _ ``the giving-back chapter.'' It is a chapter getting
more interesting by the day.

ARNOTT SCORES TWICE AS DEVILS TIE BRUINS  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was a game in which both the New Jersey Devils and
the Boston Bruins got breaks Thursday night at the Fleet Center.
And nobody took better advantage than Jason Arnott, who scored
twice in the final period to help the Devils secure a 3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rolston scored the first goal for the Devils, who extended
their unbeaten streak against Boston to 10 games (7-0-3), the
longest stretch of domination against the Bruins by any NHL team.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Allison, Ray Bourque and Cameron Mann scored for the
Bruins against Martin Brodeur, who faced 28 shots, including three
in the overtime. The Devils took 39 shots, one in the overtime,
against Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   Mann again showed his flair for the dramatic as his third-period
goal lifted the Bruins to a tie. All of Mann's four goals, scored
in the last three games, have been instrumental in Bruins victories
or ties.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, he scored on a shot from the point with 1:41 to
go. Mann scored two goals Tuesday when the Bruins beat Ottawa, 5-2.
He scored the winning goal in Chicago on Sunday. Both teams got a
huge break early in the third period. The Devils got theirs at 2
minutes 15 seconds, when a centering pass on the right by Petr
Sykora bounced off Arnott as he was falling into the goal. They all
count the same and this one counted as Arnott's 14th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's break came 66 seconds later when a shot by Bourque from
near the right boards bounced off the skate of Devils defenseman
Ken Daneyko and past a surprised Brodeur for Bourque's sixth of the
season. It tied the score at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils broke the tie on Arnott's second of the night, at
10:04, when he found the net from close range on the right after
Sykora's pass went between the skates of Don Sweeney, the Bruins'
usually reliable defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils withstood an early attack by the Bruins, who took six
of the game's first seven shots in the first four minutes. But New
Jersey dominated the rest of the opening period by limiting the
Bruins to just one shot while taking 13 against Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   Rolston scored his 18th of the season, with 3:11 left in the
opening period, when he beat Dafoe with a shot from the top of the
right circle after a pass by Bob Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Rolston's goal was his third in two games and extended his
point-scoring streak to six games, matching his career high.
</P>
<P>
   A brilliant save by Dafoe from point-blank range on Patrik
Elias, eight minutes into the second period, after a marvelous
setup on the right by Sykora prevented the Devils from taking a
two-goal lead. The Devils had another opportunity shortly afterward
when they were awarded their second manpower advantage in the game,
but came up empty. The Bruins went on the attack in the second
period and tied the score at 11:32 when Allison dug the puck out
from under Brodeur's glove for his 17th of the season to send the
teams tied going into the third.
