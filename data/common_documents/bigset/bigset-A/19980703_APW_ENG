	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Ken Griffey Jr. homered for the fourth
consecutive game, hitting his AL-leading 35th and tripling as the
Seattle Mariners beat up Darryl Kile and the Colorado Rockies 10-3
Thursday.
	   Russ Davis also homered as Seattle hammered Kile (5-11) with 10
runs in the first two innings.
	   Griffey hit a two-run triple in the six-run first, then led off
the second with a 369-foot (112-meter) opposite-field shot to left.
Griffey, who led the AL with 56 homers last season, is two behind
the Cardinals' Mark McGwire, the major league leader.
	   Bill Swift (8-4) won for the sixth time in seven decisions and
improved to 5-0 against the Rockies, his former team.
 &UR; Braves 6, Devil Rays 0
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Greg Maddux pitched his second
straight shutout to beat Rolando Arrojo in a matchup of All-Star
pitchers.
	   Maddux (12-2), the winningest pitcher in the majors, has won 10
consecutive decisions, the longest current streak in the majors. He
pitched a five-hitter for his sixth complete game and fourth
shutout of the season, the 27th of his career.
	   Keith Lockhart homered twice, a solo shot in the sixth off
Arrojo (10-5) and a three-run drive of Jim Mecir in the ninth.
 &UR; Orioles 5, Marlins 3
	   In Baltimore, Rafael Palmeiro homered for the fourth consecutive
game, raising his total to 26, and Baltimore stopped its eight-game
losing streak, one short of its longest this season. Florida had
been 5-0 against the Orioles.
	   Rookie Sidney Ponson (2-6) allowed two runs and seven hits in
six innings to help Baltimore to its first victory since June 22.
	   Joe Fontenot (0-7), vying for his first major-league victory,
allowed eight hits and four earned runs in 4 2-3 innings.
 &UR; Pirates 5, Tigers 2
	   In Pittsburgh, Esteban Loaiza limited Detroit to a run over 7
2-3 innings and helped himself with a run-scoring single as
Pittsburgh ended its four-game home losing streak.
	   Loaiza (6-4), who has won four of five decisions since
temporarily being banished to the Pirates' bullpen, took a shutout
into the seventh before Luis Gonzalez hit his ninth homer.
	   Detroit got another run in the ninth on pinch-hitter Kimera
Bartee's two-out RBI double off Ricardo Rincon. Rich Loiselle
relieved and walked Deivi Cruz before retiring pinch-hitter Joe
Randa on a grounder to the mound for his 14th save.
 &UR; Mets 9, Blue Jays 1 &QC; 
	   In Toronoto, Mike Piazza homered and Bobby Jones pitched eight
strong innings as the New York Mets salvaged the last game of the
three-game interleague series.
	   Piazza hit two-run shot in the third inning to give the Mets a
3-0 lead, and Todd Pratt had a three-run homer in the fifth to make
it 8-0.
	   After allowing a leadoff single in the second, Jones (7-5)
retired 16 straight before Carlos Delgado hit his 15th homer in the
seventh. Jones allowed five hits, struck out three and walked one
for his first victory since June 11.
 &UR; Red Sox 15, Expos 0
	   In Boston, Nomar Garciaparra hit a two-run homer to extend his
hitting streak to 23 games, and Mike Benjamin and Darren Lewis each
had four hits as Boston routed Montreal.
	   Pedro Martinez bolstered his bid to become the AL's starting
pitcher in the All-Star game with six shutout innings for the Red
Sox, who set a season-high in runs and matched a season-high with
20 hits.
	   Martinez (11-2), who retired the first 13 batters, allowed two
hits, struck out five and walked none against his former team. He
left with a 14-0 lead after the Red Sox scored six runs in the
fifth and four in the sixth.
 &UR; Indians 7, Brewers 2
	   In Milwaukee, Jim Thome hit a two-run homer, and Bartolo Colon
won his fifth straight start and had his first major league hit and
RBI for Cleveland.
	   Colon (9-4), selected to the AL All-Star team on Wednesday, gave
up 10 hits and one run in six innings, tying his shortest outing
and most hits allowed this season. He struck out four and walked
two.
	   Colon got his first hit in the majors in the fourth inning when
he singled in David Bell to make it 4-1. The 23-year-old
right-hander was selected AL pitcher of the month for June.
 &UR; White Sox 4, Astros 3
	   In Houston, Magglio Ordonez hit a three-run double in Chicago's
four-run fourth inning as the White Sox avoided a sweep in the
interleague series.
	   James Baldwin (3-3) and two relievers combined on a five-hitter
against the Astros, who got 30 hits in winning first two games by a
combined 27-6.
	   Baldwin gave up four hits, walked five and hit two batters over
5 1-3 innings. Bill Howry allowed one hit in 1 2-3 innings, and
Bill Simas pitched two hitless innings for his fourth save.
 &UR; Cardinals 3, Royals 0
	   In St. Louis, Juan Acevedo pitched 7 2-3 scoreless innings as
the St. Louis Cardinals snapped a three-game losing streak.
	   Mark McGwire, who leads the majors with 37 homers, went 0-for-2
with two walks as the Cardinals won for only the second time in
nine games and averted a three-game sweep in the Royals' first
visit to St. Louis since the 1985 World Series.
	   The Royals' five-game road winning streak came to an end, but
Kansas City still has won eight of its last 11.
 &UR; Reds 8, Twins 7
	   In Cincinnati, Reggie Sanders' triple started a four-run eighth
inning, and Eddie Taubensee's RBI single in the ninth completed
Cincinnati's comeback.
	   The Reds got their sixth victory in seven games by scoring all
eight runs off Minnesota's bullpen.
	   After Eric Milton overcame a career-high six walks and held the
Reds scoreless through six innings, Greg Swindell relieved and gave
up a three-run homer to Bret Boone that cut it to 4-3 in the
seventh.
 &UR; Dodgers 4, Rangers 1
	   In Arlington, Texas, Chan Ho Park pitched 8 1-3 strong innings
and Charles Johnson hit a three-run homer as the Los Angeles
Dodgers completed a three-game sweep.
	   Park (7-5) gave up a run on a bases-loaded balk in the second
inning, but shut down the Rangers the rest of the way, not allowing
another runner past second base. He allowed seven hits, walked two
and struck out four.
	   Scott Radinsky, who had blown five of his last six save chances,
got the final two outs for his 12th save.
	   Will Clark had two doubles for Texas, which has lost a
season-high five straight.

At least six die when Phuket ferry capsizes: reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ At least six people drowned and an
unknown number were missing in Thailand after a ferry capsized in
heavy rains and high winds near the famed resort island of Phuket,
local reports said Friday.
	   Newspapers reported that the ferry lacked safety equipment,
including enough life jackets for the more than 20 people believed
to be on board. The dead included a three-month-old girl, her
mother and the vessel's skipper.
	   Trawlers rescued about 13 people. One survivor reportedly stayed
afloat by clutching a gas tank.
	   The boat capsized Thursday about 30 minutes after leaving
Phuket, 690 kilometers (430 miles) southwest of Bangkok, for the
neighboring island of Phang-nga in the Andaman Sea.
	   Thousands of foreign tourists make the crossing between the two
islands every year, but none were immediately known to have been on
board.

Nigerian ruler shows signs of change, but will there be democracy?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL;

 &UR; By TIM SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Dozens of Nigerian political
prisoners are released and freedom is promised for the rest.
Powerful Western nations discuss warmer ties. Even Moshood Abiola,
the country's best-known prisoner, is expected to walk free soon.
	   Nigeria's isolation, nursed along by five years of brutal
military rule, is being pushed aside as the junta's new leader
reaches out to the country's opposition and the outside world.
	   The death of Gen. Sani Abacha less than a month ago has meant
far more than a new military ruler for Nigeria. It is shaping up as
the start of a seminal change for this oil-rich but poverty-wracked
West African nation.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, the career soldier who stepped into
power after Abacha's death, has signaled that his rule will be
different from his predecessor's, freeing prisoners, meeting Abiola
and welcoming visiting diplomats.
	   In his biggest move to date, he has approved the release of all
Nigeria's political prisoners, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
announced Thursday. Those freed will include Abiola, the apparent
winner of 1993's annulled presidential elections.
	   Furthermore, Abubakar is vowing to remain in power only briefly.
He insists civilians will run Nigeria after Oct. 1.
	   But just how _ and even if _ Nigeria moves toward democracy will
be the real test of Nigeria's new leader.
	   The Oct. 1 transition schedule is a deeply flawed inheritance
from Abacha, whose manipulation of it made it clear he intended
only to transform himself into a nominally civilian president.
	   Now, with less than three months until the handover date, it
seems improbable that a candidate independent of Nigeria's
governing class _ the military _ could win free elections. A
schedule change is rumored, but nothing definite has been
announced.
	   Soldiers have ruled Nigeria for all but 10 years since it gained
independence from England in 1960.
	   Generations of generals have grown rich through the elaborate
system of corruption and graft that governs nearly every financial
arrangement in Nigeria. If Abubakar wants the military to give up
power, he will have to stare down plenty of Nigerian officers who
have not yet had their chance to gather their fortunes _ or who
don't believe their fortunes are quite large enough.
	   The problems also transcend money. The Nigerian military is
largely made up of Hausa-Fulani northerners while the democracy
movement is mainly lead by southern Yorubas.
	   The structure of the democratization itself is also unclear.
	   Nigeria has five registered political parties that could
nominate candidates, but they are derided as the junta's pawns. If
there have been signs of change _ the parties, for example,
recently asked that the junta begin implementing democratic reforms
_ they have a tarnished history to overcome.
	   Many dissidents have suggested a government of national unity
led by Abiola. But Abiola told Annan he would give up his claim to
the 1993 presidential victory, and it is not known if he even wants
to remain in politics.
	   The world is, however, listening to Abubakar. He already has met
with a European Union delegation and the heads of the United
Nations and the commonwealth of former British colonies. An
American delegation was expected in Nigeria soon.
	   Nigeria's junta leaders, who can't even get visas for many
Western countries because of Abacha's abysmal human rights record,
are suddenly playing host to peacemakers.
	   Abubakar _ and the West's infatuation with him _ doesn't thrill
everyone, though. Many Nigerian dissidents acknowledge there have
been some positive steps, but they have been jaded by years of
military rule.
	   Most won't believe there is real change until the soldiers
simply step aside.
	   The date to watch, many believe, comes next week, when the
30-day mourning period for Abacha ends.
	   Analysts who waited breathlessly in the days after Abacha's
death to see if Abubakar could hang onto power, now wait
breathlessly for July 8. It's then, many say, that most policies
will begin to be promulgated and the real Abubakar will stand up.

Mexican authorities blame government salt plant in sea turtle
</HEADLINE>
deaths &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Salt sludge and brine released from a Baja
California salt plant operated by the government and Japan's
Mitsubishi Company killed 94 sea turtles in late 1997, authorities
reported.
	   The Environment Secretariat said the plant, located in the Ojo
de Liebre lagoon on the Baja Pacific coast was responsible for
turtle deaths in December.
	   ``The event (the turtle deaths) were caused by a spillage of
brine and other minerals into the lagoon from one of the
evaporation beds of the Exportadora de Sal company,'' the
secretariat said Thursday in a press statement.
	   Sea turtles are a protected species in Mexico. The December
die-off was the largest incident since a large number of turtles
died off the Pacific coast in Oaxaca in 1995 due to a red tide _
ocean waters colored red by enough one-celled animals to kill fish
and other marine life.
	   The secretariat pledged to increase monitoring of water quality
in the lagoon, where the salt company had requested approval for an
expansion of production areas, and may impose sanctions against the
firm.
	   The company produces salt by letting sea water evaporate within
containment areas.

Four killed when flash flood causes landslide in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Four people were killed and seven others
injured when flash floods caused a landslide in the mountainous
northern province of Yen Bai, the Thanh Nien (Youth) newspaper
reported Friday.
	   Heavy rain June 20-30 caused 60,000 cubic meters (2.1 million
cubic feet) of land to slide, sweeping away or damaging 61 houses
and covering 150 hectares (370 acres) of rice paddies. Four bridges
were heavily damaged.
	   The overall loss was estimated at 4 billion dong (dlrs 300,000).
	   Floods also caused serious damage to crops, houses and
irrigation systems in the central province of Ninh Thuan on Monday
and Tuesday.
	   Heavy rains have followed Vietnam's worst drought in a century,
causing flash floods around the country. The Red River and other
major waterways are nearing their banks.
	   Nguyen Duc Ngu, director general of the National
Hydrometeorology Department, said deforestation has contributed to
flash floods becoming a more serious problem in recent years.

Latin American bishops call for more social programs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ The Latin American Bishops Council
called for more social programs in the region, where it said
injustice, violence, corruption and drug trafficking are weakening
democracy.
	   The call came in a document issued at the end of a three-day
meeting here attended by 15 Roman Catholic bishops and
representatives of international financing agencies.
	   ``Economic progress alone will not be enough to respond to the
needs for a fully human and integrated Latin America. ... For this
a society of solidarity is needed, with the will to generate
change,'' the council said in a press statement Thursday.
	   The council called for ``efficient and rational governments
willing to invest in the areas of education, jobs, security,
justice, health, housing and the environment.''

Customers thought IMF stick-up at Bangkok restaurant was a joke
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Restaurant customers watching World Cup
soccer thought fellow diner Attachai Deesaraphan was joking when he
stood up, pulled a gun and said he was robbing them because of the
IMF.
	   Then he fired three shots, and the laughter stopped.
	   The Nation newspaper reported Friday what was believed to be
Thailand's first robbery where the culprit cited the International
Monetary Fund.
	   The IMF has been blamed by many Thais for worsening the
country's economic crisis, triggered when the currency was allowed
to depreciate a year ago, in demanding high interest rates as part
of a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout it is supervising.
	   ``Everybody freeze! This is a stick-up. Nobody moves!'' The
Nation quoted Attachai as saying when he and two friends attempted
to rob the restaurant in Bangkok last week. ``This is the IMF era,
give us some of your money and we will pay it back later.''
	   Attachai, now in custody, told The Nation that the customers
laughed because of the IMF reference and turned back to watch the
World Cup soccer tournament.
	   Attachai silenced the laughter by firing three shots into the
air, then robbed the clients. He was taken into custody Wednesday
after failing to pay a bill at another restaurant.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ One year after China took command of Hong Kong,
U.S.President Bill Clinton spoke up for freedom and human rights
Friday and said this once-booming port city can help ``lead Asia
out of turbulent times'' and shaky economies.
	   On the final day of his nine-day journey, Clinton addressed
community and business leaders on the theme of ``building stability
in Asia for the 21st century.'' The White House billed it as the
second most important address of his trip, after his Beijing
University speech on human rights and the steps China should take
in the 21st century.
	   In a show of support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy politicians,
the president also met with opposition leader Martin Lee and others
among the 20 legislators who won recent elections. The president,
though, had no plans to meet an additional 40 legislators who were
not selected by a direct vote of the people.
	   Ending his trip on the themes that opened it, Clinton said,
``Political freedom, respect for human rights and support for
representative government are both morally right and utlimately the
best guarantor of the stability in the world of the 21st century.''
	   Clinton's address carried a political and economic message of
cooperation and trust. ``Americans can remember three wars we have
fought in Asia,'' he said. ``We must make it our mission to avoid
another.'' Scolding India and Pakistan for their nuclear tests, he
said the two South Asian nations ``bucked the tide of history.''
	   With Asia's economy in a tailspin, Clinton said that ``too many
booming economies, too many new skyscrapers now vacant and in
default were built on shaky foundations of cronyism, corruption and
overextended credit, undermining the confidence of investors with
suddent swift and severe consequences.''
	   He welcomed a plan unveiled Thursday to revive Japan's sickly
economy by giving the government power to take over failed banks
and spend more than dlrs 200 billion to protect depositors and
businesses. He said it was a ``potentially quite significant
banking reform proposals.''
	   He said Hong Kong, grappling with its own economic woes, ``can
help Asia out of turbulent times as it contributes to China's
astonishing transformation by providing investment capital and
expertise and privatizing state enterprises and sharing legal and
regulatory experiences.''
	   Clinton said the future of Hong Kong under China should be one
of more democracy, not less, with no intrusions on freedom here.
``All this must continue,'' he said. ``I look forward to the day
when all of the people of Hong Kong realize the rights and
responsibilities of full democracy.''
	   He said some leaders worry that loud voices of dissent ``can
pull a nation apart,'' but said he fundamentally disagrees. He said
no set of leaders has the wisdom to make all the decisions without
hearing opposing views. ``Ideas are creating wealth in this
economy,'' the president said.
	   Clinton met over dinner Thursday night with Tung Chee-hwa, Hong
Kong's chief executive who was installed by the Beijing regime. In
a dinner toast, Clinton looked back over his trip and said he was
``profoundly appreciative'' to President Jiang Zemin for helping
make his trip to China ``a remarkably successful attempt to
continue to build our partnership for the future.''
	   And in a message sure to resound in Hong Kong, Clinton said he
was encouraged by signs ``that we can build together a future that
is more stable, more prosperous and free.''
	   Tung, in turn, assured Clinton that Jiang had reaffirmed his
commitment to maintain autonomy for Hong Kong, one year after the
former British colony returned to Chinese rule after 156 years.
	   ``The central government leaders are determined to ensure the
implementation of the basic law,'' Tung said, referring to the
rules under which Hong Kong is administered.
	   Fears that Beijing would crack down on demonstrators and push
political opponents to the margin after the July 1, 1997,
transition have so far proved unfounded.
	   Instead, Asia's sagging economy has eclipsed political concerns.
	   Tourism is down 20 percent while unemployment is at a 15-year
high. Sharing the woes felt across Asia, Hong Kong's housing values
and stock market have declined.
	   Clinton is the first U.S. president to visit Hong Kong, although
he and his wife Hillary visited before they moved to the White
House.
	   The president arrived here after a leisurely boat trip down the
Li River in Guilin, among storybook limestone mountains that have
inspired artists for generations. He urged China not to sacrifice
its already heavily polluted environment for the sake of economic
growth.
	   As Clinton left mainland China, police freed the last of seven
dissidents rounded up in connection with his visit. A human rights
group said police in eastern Hangzhou released Zhu Yufu after
holding him for 48 hours.

Clinton fails to keep promise to Caribbean, leaders say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ The United States has failed to honor
promises U.S. President Bill Clinton made more than a year ago to
help Caribbean countries, Caribbean leaders said.
	   ``Very slow or no progress'' has come of pledges of help that
Clinton made when he met with Caribbean leaders in Barbados in May
1997, Barbados Prime Minister Owen Arthur said at a news conference
Thursday. He represented leaders at a summit of the 16-nation
Caribbean Community.
	   One promise was a gift of dlrs 3 million to help diversify the
economies of eastern Caribbean islands hurt by a U.S. challenge
last year to their preferential banana trade with Europe at the
World Trade Organization.
	   Arthur also said that the United States had not made good on a
pledge to help the seven members of the Organization of Eastern
Caribbean States join the Inter-American Development Bank, the
principal institution for hemispheric development.
	   ``We have a situation that amounts to total absurdity,'' Arthur
said.
	   Prime Minister Sir James Mitchell of St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, whose country gets most of its foreign earnings from
bananas, also criticized the United States.
	   ``Is the U.S. going to continue to challenge every time we
move?'' he asked a reporter. ``They really want to destroy our
(banana) regime.''

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Seven people drowned after a ferry
capsized in heavy rains and high winds near the famed resort island
of Phuket, police said Friday.
	   Newspapers cited survivors as saying that the ferry lacked
safety equipment, including enough life jackets for the 17 people
on board. One survivor stayed afloat by clutching a gas tank.
	   The dead included a three-month-old girl, her mother and the
vessel's skipper. The boat capsized Thursday about 30 minutes after
leaving Phuket, 690 kilometers (430 miles) southwest of Bangkok,
for the neighboring island of Phang-nga in the Andaman Sea.
	   Police said that all the passengers had been accounted for and
six were being treated at hospitals for minor injuries. No foreign
tourists were on board.

Caribbean leaders reach accord to end racial strife in Guyana
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Caribbean-Mandela, BC-Caribbean-US &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHELLE FAUL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ At the urging of Caribbean leaders
celebrating 25 years of efforts to unite their region, Guyana's
feuding president and opposition leader signed an agreement to end
weeks of political and racial violence.
	   The agreement, pledging to keep an earlier peace pact, came
after an unidentified U.S. party offered to mediate in the crisis,
according to several sources at a summit of the 16-member Caribbean
Community.
	   Thursday's agreement pact followed weeks of violent protests and
firebombings in Guyana by blacks who support Guyanese opposition
leader Desmond Hoyte. They called for the resignation of the
successor of former President Cheddi Jagan _ Jagan's American-born
white widow. Janet Jagan won disputed December elections, with the
support of Guyanese of East Indian descent.
	   On Thursday, she and Hoyte signed a pledge to make peace.
	   Guyana's Foreign Minister Clement Rohee said Hoyte had agreed to
immediately end the protests and have his legislators take up
Parliamentary seats that they had abandoned by July 15.
	   Hoyte aides said the pact also called for a commission to
propose constitutional reforms to give the opposition more say in
government, and address charges that Jagan's government
discriminates against blacks.
	   ``You would be amazed to know how wide the racial divide is in
Guyana today,'' Hoyte said before the agreement was announced.
	   Guyana's current crisis overshadowed the summit to celebrate the
25th anniversary of a treaty to unite Caribbean peoples within a
common market now comprised of 16 members.
	   Jagan had warned that the race riots posed a threat to
democracies throughout the Caribbean. She urged leaders to condemn
Hoyte's party's tactics of ``terror, bombings, bomb scares,
robbings and beatings of innocent citizens.''
	   Hoyte, in turn, said the protests were an explosion of years of
``deeply felt grievances'' by Afro-Guyanese who have lost jobs,
government contracts and land to Indo-Guyanese. Hoyte was Guyana's
president from 1985-1992.
	   The racial violence is being watched closely throughout the
Caribbean and especially in Trinidad, where Basdeo Panday is the
first prime minister of Indian descent. Like Jagan, Panday is
accused of excluding blacks from government and from state
contracts.
	   In both Trinidad and Guyana, blacks dominated politics and
Indians dominated the economy from the independence era of the
1960s until recently.

17 children die of dengue fever in one Vietnamese province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ An outbreak of dengue fever killed at
least 17 children in a single province last month, the Thanh Nie
(Youth) newspaper reported Friday.
	   Only one child died from the virus in the southern province of
Dong Nai in the first five months of the year. But the number of
fatalities soared last month, with speculation that the death toll
could be even higher.
	   The two provincial hospitals have admitted 2,200 children with
dengue this year.
	   Dr. Su Son, director of the Xuan Loc hospital, warned that the
disease, which previously attacked mostly children over age 5, now
is hitting babies.
	   In late May, the Health Ministry said the incidence of dengue in
Vietnam had doubled from the previous year, with the death toll
more than tripling and cases reported in two-thirds of the
country's provinces.
	   Last year, 108,000 people contracted dengue fever in Vietnam,
with more than 200 deaths.
	   Dengue fever normally breaks out here around the rainy season,
which starts in May but was late this year. It infects an estimated
50 million people each year in a geographic band around the
equator.
	   There is no vaccine for the mosquito-borne virus, which causes
fever, joint pains, chills and, in serious cases, hemorrhaging.
Patients can take several weeks to recover.

Clinton says Hong Kong can help lead Asia out of economic crisis

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ One year after China took command of Hong Kong,
U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke up for freedom and human rights
Friday and said this once-booming port city can help ``lead Asia
out of turbulent times'' and shaky economies.
	   On the final day of his nine-day journey, Clinton addressed
community and business leaders on the theme of ``building stability
in Asia for the 21st century.'' The White House billed it as the
second most important speech of his trip, after his Peking
University speech on human rights and the steps China should take
in the 21st century.
	   In a show of support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy politicians,
the president also met with opposition leader Martin Lee and others
among the 20 legislators who won recent elections. The president,
though, had no plans to meet an additional 40 legislators who were
not selected by a direct vote of the people.
	   Lee expressed gratitude to Clinton for coming to China and
speaking directly about human rights and democracy _ particularly
here. He said the first year of the transition to China's control
had gone well but that the pace of democratic reforms should be
accelerated, Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger
said.
	   Ending his trip on the themes that opened it, Clinton said,
``Political freedom, respect for human rights and support for
representative government are both morally right and utlimately the
best guarantor of the stability in the world of the 21st century.''
He spoke in the Hong Kong convention center, the sight of last
year's handover ceremony where the Union Jack was lowered one last
time and the red flag of China was raised.
	   Clinton's address carried a political and economic message of
cooperation and trust. ``Americans can remember three wars we have
fought in Asia,'' he said. ``We must make it our mission to avoid
another.'' Scolding India and Pakistan for their nuclear tests, he
said the two South Asian nations ``bucked the tide of history.''
	   With Asia's economy in a tailspin, Clinton said that ``too many
booming economies, too many new skyscrapers now vacant and in
default were built on shaky foundations of cronyism, corruption and
overextended credit, undermining the confidence of investors with
suddent swift and severe consequences.''
	   He welcomed a plan unveiled Thursday to revive Japan's sickly
economy by giving the government power to take over failed banks
and spend more than dlrs 200 billion to protect depositors and
businesses. He said it was a ``potentially quite significant
banking reform proposals.''
	   He said Hong Kong, grappling with its own economic woes, ``can
help Asia out of turbulent times as it contributes to China's
astonishing transformation by providing investment capital and
expertise and privatizing state enterprises and sharing legal and
regulatory experiences.''
	   Clinton said the future of Hong Kong under China should be one
of more democracy, not less, with no intrusions on freedom here.
``All this must continue,'' he said. ``I look forward to the day
when all of the people of Hong Kong realize the rights and
responsibilities of full democracy.''
	   He said some leaders worry that loud voices of dissent ``can
pull a nation apart,'' but said he fundamentally disagrees. He said
no set of leaders has the wisdom to make all the decisions without
hearing opposing views. ``Ideas are creating wealth in this
economy,'' the president said.
	   Clinton met over dinner Thursday night with Tung Chee-hwa, Hong
Kong's chief executive who was installed by the Beijing regime. In
a dinner toast, Clinton looked back over his trip and said he was
``profoundly appreciative'' to President Jiang Zemin for helping
make his trip to China ``a remarkably successful attempt to
continue to build our partnership for the future.''
	   And in a message sure to resound in Hong Kong, Clinton said he
was encouraged by signs ``that we can build together a future that
is more stable, more prosperous and free.''
	   Tung, in turn, assured Clinton that Jiang had reaffirmed his
commitment to maintain autonomy for Hong Kong, one year after the
former British colony returned to Chinese rule after 156 years.
	   ``The central government leaders are determined to ensure the
implementation of the basic law,'' Tung said, referring to the
rules under which Hong Kong is administered.
	   Fears that Beijing would crack down on demonstrators and push
political opponents to the margin after the July 1, 1997,
transition have so far proved unfounded.
	   Instead, Asia's sagging economy has eclipsed political concerns.
	   Tourism is down 20 percent while unemployment is at a 15-year
high. Sharing the woes felt across Asia, Hong Kong's housing values
and stock market have declined.
	   Clinton is the first U.S. president to visit Hong Kong, although
he and his wife Hillary visited before they moved to the White
House.
	   The president and his family arrived here late Thursday on Air
Force One in a flurry of excitement. The president's aircraft was
the first passenger plane to land at the city's new dlrs 20 billion
Chek Lap Kok International Airport. Hours earlier, Jiang dedicated
the airport and left; his was the first plane to take off.
	   The president flew here after a leisurely boat trip down the Li
River in Guilin, among storybook limestone mountains that have
inspired artists for generations. He urged China not to sacrifice
its already heavily polluted environment for the sake of economic
growth.
	   As Clinton left mainland China, police freed the last of seven
dissidents rounded up in connection with his visit. A human rights
group said police in eastern Hangzhou released Zhu Yufu after
holding him for 48 hours.

Clinton says Hong Kong can help lead Asia out of economic crisis

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with details of meeting with opposition leader &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ One year after China took command of Hong Kong,
U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke up for freedom and human rights
Friday and said this once-booming port city can help ``lead Asia
out of turbulent times'' and shaky economies.
	   On the final day of his nine-day journey, Clinton addressed
community and business leaders on the theme of ``building stability
in Asia for the 21st century.'' The White House billed it as the
second most important speech of his trip, after his Peking
University speech on human rights and the steps China should take
in the 21st century.
	   In a show of support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy politicians,
the president also met with opposition leader Martin Lee and others
among the 20 legislators who won recent elections. The president,
though, had no plans to meet an additional 40 legislators who were
not selected by a direct vote of the people.
	   Lee expressed gratitude to Clinton for coming to China and
speaking directly about human rights and democracy _ particularly
here. He said the first year of the transition to China's control
had gone well but that the pace of democratic reforms should be
accelerated, Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger
said.
	   Ending his trip on the themes that opened it, Clinton said,
``Political freedom, respect for human rights and support for
representative government are both morally right and utlimately the
best guarantor of the stability in the world of the 21st century.''
He spoke in the Hong Kong convention center, the sight of last
year's handover ceremony where the Union Jack was lowered one last
time and the red flag of China was raised.
	   Clinton's address carried a political and economic message of
cooperation and trust. ``Americans can remember three wars we have
fought in Asia,'' he said. ``We must make it our mission to avoid
another.'' Scolding India and Pakistan for their nuclear tests, he
said the two South Asian nations ``bucked the tide of history.''
	   With Asia's economy in a tailspin, Clinton said that ``too many
booming economies, too many new skyscrapers now vacant and in
default were built on shaky foundations of cronyism, corruption and
overextended credit, undermining the confidence of investors with
suddent swift and severe consequences.''
	   He welcomed a plan unveiled Thursday to revive Japan's sickly
economy by giving the government power to take over failed banks
and spend more than dlrs 200 billion to protect depositors and
businesses. He said it was a ``potentially quite significant
banking reform proposals.''
	   He said Hong Kong, grappling with its own economic woes, ``can
help Asia out of turbulent times as it contributes to China's
astonishing transformation by providing investment capital and
expertise and privatizing state enterprises and sharing legal and
regulatory experiences.''
	   Clinton said the future of Hong Kong under China should be one
of more democracy, not less, with no intrusions on freedom here.
``All this must continue,'' he said. ``I look forward to the day
when all of the people of Hong Kong realize the rights and
responsibilities of full democracy.''
	   He said some leaders worry that loud voices of dissent ``can
pull a nation apart,'' but said he fundamentally disagrees. He said
no set of leaders has the wisdom to make all the decisions without
hearing opposing views. ``Ideas are creating wealth in this
economy,'' the president said.
	   Clinton met over dinner Thursday night with Tung Chee-hwa, Hong
Kong's chief executive who was installed by the Beijing regime. In
a dinner toast, Clinton looked back over his trip and said he was
``profoundly appreciative'' to President Jiang Zemin for helping
make his trip to China ``a remarkably successful attempt to
continue to build our partnership for the future.''
	   And in a message sure to resound in Hong Kong, Clinton said he
was encouraged by signs ``that we can build together a future that
is more stable, more prosperous and free.''
	   Tung, in turn, assured Clinton that Jiang had reaffirmed his
commitment to maintain autonomy for Hong Kong, one year after the
former British colony returned to Chinese rule after 156 years.
	   ``The central government leaders are determined to ensure the
implementation of the basic law,'' Tung said, referring to the
rules under which Hong Kong is administered.
	   Fears that Beijing would crack down on demonstrators and push
political opponents to the margin after the July 1, 1997,
transition have so far proved unfounded.
	   Instead, Asia's sagging economy has eclipsed political concerns.
	   Tourism is down 20 percent while unemployment is at a 15-year
high. Sharing the woes felt across Asia, Hong Kong's housing values
and stock market have declined.
	   Clinton is the first U.S. president to visit Hong Kong, although
he and his wife Hillary visited before they moved to the White
House.
	   The president and his family arrived here late Thursday on Air
Force One in a flurry of excitement. The president's aircraft was
the first passenger plane to land at the city's new dlrs 20 billion
Chek Lap Kok International Airport. Hours earlier, Jiang dedicated
the airport and left; his was the first plane to take off.
	   The president flew here after a leisurely boat trip down the Li
River in Guilin, among storybook limestone mountains that have
inspired artists for generations. He urged China not to sacrifice
its already heavily polluted environment for the sake of economic
growth.
	   As Clinton left mainland China, police freed the last of seven
dissidents rounded up in connection with his visit. A human rights
group said police in eastern Hangzhou released Zhu Yufu after
holding him for 48 hours.

Mahathir: Malaysia may bow to IMF
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia may have to turn to the
International Monetary Fund if government policies fail to steer
the economy to recovery, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said
Friday.
	   ``Until now we did not need IMF help because we have taken some
measures to help the economy,'' said Mahathir, one of Asia's most
vocal critics of IMF policies.
	   ``However, if we still cannot solve the economic problems, maybe
one day we will have to bow to the IMF,'' Mahathir said in a
speech.
	   He said he had recently consulted the IMF on resolving problems
facing debt-laden Malaysian companies.
	   But Mahathir still maintained that the IMF prescription was
ill-suited to Asian nations.
	   The IMF's approach to revive economies included wage cuts,
trimming work forces, closing down troubled companies as well as
government departments that the multilateral agency deemed useless,
he said.
	   He pointed out that Indonesia had 24 million jobless, a number
which was more than Malaysia's population.
	   ``For them, the suffering of the employees is unimportant. It is
only important for them to revive the economy through reduced
spending.''
	   But he also indicated that Malaysia may have to cut salaries of
government employees if the economy worsens. Last year, bureaucrats
took a 10 percent pay cut when the government announced its first
austerity package.
	   Mahathir has repeatedly blamed the IMF for pushing Indonesia
into the violent crisis that culminated in President Suharto's
ouster.
	   A recent policy turnaround has taken Malaysia away from the IMF
road to recovery. The government this week announced a hike in
spending and introduced measures to encourage banks to ease lending
to ailing companies.
	   Mahathir has also railed against high interest rates that
Malaysia, heeding IMF-advocated policy, had imposed to quell
inflationary trends and prevent capital flight that could shatter
its already depreciated currency.
	   High interest rates would kill business, Mahathir said in
Friday's speech to government employees.
	   Malaysia's economy contracted by 1.8 percent in the first three
months of 1998, compared to 6.9 percent growth in the previous
quarter. Independent analysts have dismissed the government's
optimism on recovery, instead predicting a recession.

Chinese media, by command, open for Clinton to benefit Jiang

 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Clinton-China
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ For Communist Party rulers, giving U.S. President
Bill Clinton unprecedented, direct access to China's airwaves and
people was a small gamble that largely paid off. Images of Clinton
and President Jiang Zemin together on television _ and of Jiang
rebutting Clinton _ impressed a Chinese public eager to see their
nation recognized as a world power.
	   Like much statecraft in fast-changing China, the summit strategy
borrowed standard communist tactics while blending in fresh
evidence of China's rising global status. The mix sheds light on
how the party wields power as its once totalitarian image slips
somewhat.
	   With communist ideology discredited by two decades of successful
capitalist-style reforms, Chinese leaders need new symbols to
justify their rule.
	   Clinton discussed Tibet and other political taboos with Jiang on
Chinese television, live. Clinton talked human rights on state TV
two days later and yet again the day after on Shanghai talk radio.
	   In allowing Clinton on air, Jiang bet the signal of openness
would be well-received by the public. Any fallout from unwanted
frank talk could be contained by the party's control of state-run
media and the security forces. Underscoring the limits, police
detained at least seven dissidents in the past nine days.
	   Clinton's trip offered Jiang _ the party chief and former state
industry bureaucrat once dismissed as a political lightweight _ the
opportunity to add the luster of international statesman to his
role as president.
	   To make sure the message got through to the Chinese public and
his critics in the party and abroad, Jiang mobilized the propaganda
machinery, packed with allies and proteges, Chinese media sources
said.
	   ``The Chinese government wants to make people feel that
Chinese-U.S. relations are going to a better stage and that this
will give China a better image in the world,'' said one television
reporter familiar with the strategy.
	   Before Clinton boarded Air Force One for China last week, the
Propaganda Ministry, charged with keeping the media on the party
line, issued orders on covering the first visit by a U.S. president
in nine years.
	   All reporting on Clinton was to be ``not hot, not cold'' and
must mention that the U.S. president's trip occurred solely because
of Jiang's successful White House diplomacy last year, said the
media sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   One Jiang protege, government spokesman Zhao Qizheng, personally
quashed Foreign Ministry opposition to giving Clinton air time
during his nine days in China, one source said.
	   Turning aside worries about what an uncensored Clinton might
say, Zhao argued that the patriotic Chinese public could be trusted
to back Jiang, the source said.
	   During Clinton and Jiang's nationally televised news conference
last Saturday, the 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen Square democracy
demonstrators, dissident arrests and negotiating with the Dalai
Lama on Tibet _ politically sensitive issues rarely mentioned in
the media _ all came up. But the sensational news went no further.
	   The next day, newspapers by government order all carried the
same official Xinhua News Agency account, reducing the discussion
to a one-sentence reference, the sources said.
	   Despite the fleeting exposure, many people cheered Jiang for
holding the live news conference, just like other world leaders,
and for standing up to Clinton on issues in which Chinese feel
Americans shouldn't meddle.
	   ``President Jiang made a lot of sense,'' said Xin Qingong, an
auto repairman in Beijing. He added that Clinton came across as
``humorous'' for suggesting Jiang meet with the long-vilified Dalai
Lama.
	   Likewise, Clinton confronted an undertone of nationalistic,
slightly hostile questioning from students at Peking University
during a speech broadcast live. One questioned whether Clinton's
smile concealed a scheme to contain China's rise. The
question-and-answer session was rebroadcast in prime time;
Clinton's speech was not.
	   Such responses are predictable in China where pride in the
present is strong and access to impartial sources of information
limited. The government still jams broadcasts by the Voice of
America, Radio Free Asia and the BBC.
	   ``We think that given the chance, all Chinese will jump for
freedom of expression and be more critical of inequities and
injustices,'' said Orville Schell, a journalism professor at the
University of California, Berkeley, who has written several books
on China.
	   ``But in reality there are a lot of other things at work here:
nationalism and pride and all these things that have made China
feel insecure, inferior and defensive,'' he said.
	   While Clinton aides have repeatedly praised the Chinese leaders'
``bold'' decision on the broadcasts, they too have noticed the
carefully shaded coverage.
	   ``You have a system which still, obviously, is far from a free
system and which was selective and restrictive in the way it
covered'' the president's visit, said Jeff Bader, Asian affairs
expert at the White House's National Security Council.

New York warns of sanctions against Swiss banks over Holocaust-era

business with Swiss banks. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ American officials have increased the pressure
on Swiss banks, with New York City and New York state threatening
to bar short-term investments with the banks, which are suspected
of holding the assets of Holocaust victims.
	   Thursday's move comes one day after a commission representing
hundreds of U.S. finance officials cleared the way for sanctions,
saying negotiations between the banks and Jewish survivors of the
Nazi genocide seeking their families' assets had ``reached a total,
stone-like impasse,'' said Alan Hevesi, commission chairman. There
had been a moratorium in place before on sanctions.
	   California, a commission member, announced Wednesday it will not
seek new contracts with U.S. subsidiaries of Swiss banks.
	   New York state, which with California has the largest pension
funds linked to Swiss banks, said Thursday that if there is no
settlement by Sept. 1, state and city officials will bar short-term
investments with the banks.
	   The banks and Swiss investment firms also will be forbidden from
selling state and city debt, said Hevesi, who is the New York City
comptroller. If the impasse continues, he said, the bans will be
extended to additional Swiss financial services in November and to
all Swiss companies in January.
	   New York state deposits dlrs 150 million every day in Swiss
banks on a short-term basis, and Swiss banks hold dlrs 71 million
in the state's long-term notes.
	   Other commission members are also taking or considering action.
	   In New Jersey, the legislature is considering a bill that would
require the state to divest some dlrs 66 million in stock invested
with Union Bank of Switzerland until assets are returned to
Holocaust survivors. Vermont, Rhode Island and Kentucky also are
considering the possibility of sanctions.
	   Last year, Massachusetts ended its dlrs 120,000-a-year contract
with Union Bank.
	   Hevesi said he hopes U.S. officials will allow a measured
process of sanctions to give negotiators time to resolve the
issues.
	   That didn't mollify Swiss banking officials.
	   ``The Swiss banks are outraged,'' said Ulrich Pfister, a
spokesman for the Credit Suisse Group in Zurich. ``Sanctions are
unjustified and counterproductive. We will study all measures we
can take against them.''
	   The Swiss government issued a statement calling sanctions
``illegal'' and said, ``The cabinet will not allow itself to be
influenced by such pressure tactics.''
	   The conservative Swiss People's Party, the junior partner in the
four-party governing Federal Council, or cabinet, described the
threats as ``extortion,'' while the centrist Radical Democrats said
the moves had no place in affairs between civilized countries.
	   Even the Swiss Confederation of Hebrew Congregations, the
country's main Jewish organization, said it regretted the
``unproductive decision.''
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said
sanctions by individual states or cities could hurt U.S.-Swiss
relations and urged continued negotiations.
	   Plans to drop business with Swiss banks, Rubin said, ``will call
into question the openness of our financial markets, and they may
lead to greater inflexibility on the part of the Swiss
institutions.''
	   Tens of thousands of Holocaust victims deposited money in Swiss
banks as the Nazis gained power in Europe. But victims' relatives
say bank officials stalled survivors and their heirs after World
War II, claiming they could not find accounts or demanding
nonexistent death certificates before giving funds to relatives of
those who died in concentration camps.
	   Three Swiss banks made a take-it-or-leave-it offer of dlrs 600
million last month. Jewish leaders rejected it as being far less
than the dormant wartime assets Holocaust victims say the banks
stole from their families.
	   Melvyn Weiss, lawyer for more than 31,000 plaintiffs in a
lawsuit against Swiss banks, said Jewish groups have proposed a
dlrs 1.5 billion settlement that would cover claims against all
Swiss banks as well as the Swiss government.

Four arrested on fraud charges in Japan nursing home construction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prosecutors in central Japan arrested four people
Friday on suspicion of illegally obtaining 383 million yen (dlrs
2.73 million) in state subsidies to build a nursing home.
	   The four men were suspected of falsifying papers by inflating
construction cost estimates to get the subsidies, the Gifu District
Prosecutors Office said.
	   An office official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
four received a total of 1.36 billion yen (dlrs 9.71 million) from
the government. That compared with a contract price for the project
of about 950 million yen (dlrs 6.78 million).
	   Among those arrested were Eiryu Noda, 66, an employee of the
Kyoto-based Nishi Honganji Buddhist temple, and Akira Yamanouchi,
57, a former branch manager at Hazama Corp.'s Nagoya office.
Hazama, based in Tokyo, is a major construction company.
	   If found guilty the suspects face up to five years in prison, or
a fine of 1 million yen (dlrs 7,100).
	   The nursing facility in question opened in April 1997 in Gifu,
274 kilometers (171 miles), west of Tokyo.
	   The latest allegation of fraud in the building of nursing homes
comes amid a spate of similar cases. Nursing home construction is
booming across Japan, a country with one of the fastest aging
societies on earth.
	   Last month, a Tokyo court handed down prison sentences to two
former bureaucrats from the Health and Welfare Ministry for
receiving bribes from a nursing home developer near Tokyo.

Palmer hopes to show old form in a new tournament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID GINSBURG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLUMBIA, Maryland (AP) _ Arnold Palmer hasn't won a senior
event since 1988 and has shot under par in exactly three rounds
this season.
	   Palmer's best years are well behind him, yet he still manages to
draw a sizeable crowd wherever he goes. There's no reason to expect
anything different this weekend as the 68-year-old star makes his
way around the Hobbit's Glen Golf Club course during the inaugural
State Farm Senior Classic.
	   The three-day tournament, which was to begin Friday, is the
first new event on the Senior tour in three years. It replaces
Lexington, Kentucky, on the 43-event schedule and has been
guaranteed a three-year run by the U.S. PGA.
	   ``I fully expect this event to be around a lot longer than three
years,'' tournament director John Mathews said. ``I think the fan
support will be such that this will become a fixture on the Senior
tour.''
	   Palmer is clearly the main attraction at the event, even though
nine of the top 10 money-winners have entered, including Hale
Irwin, who needs to win only dlrs 6,335 to surpass Greg Norman as
the leading money winner in the history of professional golf.
	   Palmer's successive rounds of 71 at last week's NFL Cadillac
Classic were only the second and third times this season he broke
par. The mind is willing, but the body just isn't able to crank out
the superlative rounds he enjoyed in his heyday some 25 years ago.
	   ``It makes it difficult for me. I still have the desire to play
well and to win,'' he said. ``Somewhere in this thick skull of mine
there's the belief that I can still win.''
	   Encouraged by his performance at the Cadillac Classic, Palmer is
hopeful that this will be the week he gets his game in full working
order.
	   ``I feel there's some hope. I feel like I'm hitting the ball
better,'' he said. ``Hopefully, I'll be able to play well this week
and show the fans some of the old Arnie.''

Senior Japanese economist foresees hesitant recovery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A senior Japanese economist warned Friday that
his country's economic recovery will be a slow and hesitant process
lasting another two to three years.
	   ``Perhaps in the latter half of this fiscal year, we will have
some signs of a turnaround,'' Makoto Nomura, a deputy
director-general at Japan's Economic Planning Agency, told a forum
in Singapore on the Asian crisis.
	   But he cautioned that the recovery will be ``very hesitant''
over the medium to longer term because the process of ongoing
structural reforms will cause some hardship, while consumer and
investor confidence will only return slowly.
	   Nomura was optimistic that current government measures to pull
Japan out of its recession would eventually lead to renewed growth,
though only after a period of ``two to three years'' of faltering
recovery.
	   On Thursday, Japan announced a ``bridge bank'' plan to help
resurrect the country's increasingly insolvent financial sector, in
addition to a stimulus package worth 30 trillion yen (dlrs 215
billion) unveiled earlier this year.
	   Nomura added that ``sustainable recovery cannot be achieved''
without such structural reform, but warned that other factors will
play a part in any return to growth.
	   Both he and Susumu Taketomi, a member of the Bank of Japan's
policy board who also spoke at the forum, stressed the importance
of renewing consumer demand and investor confidence as crucial to
any likely recovery.
	   Pointing to an inflexible supply-side in Japan's economy, Nomura
argued that producers and the service sector have been too
conservative.
	   For example, he noted that Japan's elderly own more than half
the country's total of about dlrs 8.6 trillion in savings, but
there are few products and services to specifically attract their
money.
	   Throughout the economy, ``stagnation of demand is the most
prominent problem,'' he said.
	   Confirming this view, Taketomi said that the government should
give top priority to ``measures which specifically aim at removing
the sources of apprehension'' both for consumers and within the
markets in Japan.

Jewish settlers in Muslim Quarter create new front line for
</HEADLINE>
conflict &QL;

<TEXT>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Jewish settlers in Jerusalem's Muslim Quarter
live on the fault line of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They
live elbow to elbow with Palestinians who warn that their presence
could set off a new war. In their own view, the settlers are the
vanguard of a campaign to claim the entire disputed city for the
Jews. An AP correspondent reports from the fortified Jewish
compounds of the Old City.
 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A curious procession wound its way through the
crowded market in the Muslim Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City.
	   Two muscular Israeli security guards, sporting dark sunglasses
and packing pistols, were followed by a troupe of toddlers. The
kids, holding hands and merrily bouncing along behind the big men,
looked like ducklings following their mother.
	   Suddenly, the group stopped.
	   A head count revealed that 5-year-old Ronit Rabinovitch had been
left behind at the kindergarten after she had slipped out for a
moment to buy a popsicle. The private guards _ all former army
commandos _ nervously lit cigarettes as they radioed headquarters.
	   ``OK,'' called out a deep, clipped voice over the walkie-talkie.
``Stay calm. You keep going to point B. Meanwhile, we will send the
fox patrol to the base to pick up Rabinovitch, and move her to
point C. After you drop off the kids at B, swing back to C and take
Rabinovitch home to D.''
	   Ronit and her classmates are no ordinary 5-year-olds.
	   They are the children of the Ateret Cohanim community, a
settlement group trying to move as many Jews as possible into Arab
neighborhoods in Jerusalem and thus undercut Palestinian claims to
the traditionally Arab eastern sector as a capital.
	   Sixty-five Jewish families live in 40 fortified compounds in the
Old City's Muslim Quarter, protected by private guards who the
settlers say are heavily subsidized by the government of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While Netanyahu openly supports the
settlers' objectives, he has been circumspect about whether the
government is funding their campaign on the ground.
	   Domestically and internationally, there is opposition to that
campaign. A majority of Palestinians see the settlers as invaders
and the two sides clash regularly. Israeli peace activists, many of
whom believe Palestinians should be given control over the Old
City, y-to-day hardships of living among thousands
of Palestinians who regard them with suspicion and hate.
	   ``We are blessed to be able to live here,'' said 40-year-old
Raya Cohen as she held her two daughters, ages 4 and 8, who had
just made it home safely from school.
	   Still, two Ateret Cohanim members have been killed in less than
a year in nighttime street ambushes by Palestinian militants, and
settlers have to call for armed escorts whenever they want to go to
work, shop or pray. Some take their evening stroll on the roof so
they can have a little privacy without a guard.
	   Cohen and her husband, Yossi, were the first Jewish couple to
move into the Muslim Quarter 19 years ago. The kitchen window of
their second-floor apartment looks out directly onto the Al Aqsa
Mosque, Islam's third-holiest shrine, built on the site where the
Jewish Temple once stood.
	   In the living room, old photographs of famous rabbis and crayon
drawings fight for shelf space with rows of religious books.
	   Directly across the hall from the Cohens' apartment is a Jewish
study center, where bearded men sway over holy books.
	   But up the stairs from the study center, a Palestinian family
lives in one room, having refused top-dollar offers from settlers
to sell. The Palestinians have strung up a green sheet inside the
door _ to serve as an additional divider between them and the
settlers.
	   A little redheaded Jewish girl playing marbles in the stairwell
offered up the information that ``those Arabs over there are known
terrorists.''
	   In the Cohens' cramped apartment, while Mrs. Cohen hurried to
make lunch and get dressed for work at the Hadassah Mt. Scopus
Hospice outside the Old City, four neighbors' kids stopped by to
play games on the Cohens' computer.
	   The bleeps of the machine mixed with the pious murmurs of
Christian pilgrims walking along the Via Dolorosa _ Jesus'
traditional route to the crucifixion _ just an alley away. A Muslim
call to prayer drifted through a window.
	   Mrs. Cohen said that when she first settled in the Muslim
Quarter, friends refused to visit her, fearing for their safety.
Her mother thought she was mad. Her left-wing sister-in-law forbade
her children to come for play dates.
	   ``I volunteered to be the crazy woman when I moved here. Only a
crazy person can go first. But it needs to be done,'' said Mrs.
Cohen as she emerged from the bedroom in her white long skirt and
matching head covering.
	   Mrs. Cohen usually wakes up at the crack of dawn. That's when
her husband heads off to morning prayers at the Western Wall, the
last remnant of the Jewish Temple.
	   The Wall is a three-minute walk away, but Mrs. Cohen said she
makes him wait for a security escort. Later, she gets her kids
ready for school and sends them off, sandwich bags in hand, with
the compound patrol at 7:45 a.m.
	   On mornings when she is not working at the hospice she shops for
groceries. From Arab merchants in her street, she only buys canned
goods. She goes to the Jewish Quarter, 20 minutes away on foot, to
buy bread, eggs and kosher meat, dragging her shopping cart along
the cobblestone alleys.
	   Many of her Palestinian neighbors know her, some even by name,
but there is no eye contact when she passes them on the street.
	   The settler women meet about three times a month at one of the
homes to listen to guest speakers talk about issues ranging from
child rearing to the weekly Torah portion.
	   After settler Haim Korman was stabbed to death in May, a child
psychologist talked to the mothers about dealing with their
children's fears.
	   ``When all is said and done, one's life has to be lived
according to one's beliefs,'' said Mrs. Cohen. ``I believe in a
Jewish Jerusalem and therefore I am here.''

Fiji's Rabuka will meet Taiwan leader despite Chinese objection
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka has turned down
a request from China for him not to meet Taiwanese Premier Vincent
Siew when he passes through Fiji on Sunday.
	   The Chinese embassy in Suva has asked Rabuka to cancel a meeting
with Siew at Nadi International Airport scheduled for Sunday to
avoid what an embassy spokesman said would be a ``converse act.''
	   But Rabuka said the airport meeting was ``just a courtesy
visit'' during which he wanted to thank Taiwan for its assistance
to Fiji drought victims.
	   Siew will pass through Fiji's airport on his way to 80th
birthday celebrations for the King of Tonga, King Taufa'ahau Tupou
IV.
	   Fiji officially supports a One China policy and is about to open
an embassy in Beijing.
	   Fiji also has a trade office in Taiwan _ to which China objects
_ and allows Taiwan to operate a quasi-diplomatic office in Suva as
a trade center.
	   The Chinese Embassy sent a formal protest against Siew's
recognition at the airport to the Fiji Foreign Office, the
spokesman said, on condition on anonymity.
	   Leading a delegation promising aid and investment, Siew left on
visits to three South Pacific nations Thursday that may include an
unofficial stopover in Australia.
	   Stopping off in Australia would likely annoy China, which
regards Taiwan as a breakaway province, and is trying to isolate it
diplomatically.
	   Siew and his wife, accompanied by Cabinet officials, businessmen
and technical advisers, will stop first in Tonga, the Foreign
Ministry said.
	   They then travel to Fiji, then the Solomon Islands, where Siew
will attend a Melanesian culture festival and address Parliament,
the ministry said.
	   The delegation is expected to sign investment and aid agreements
covering forestry, manufacturing, farming, fisheries, and the
tourist industry.
	   Just 27 countries recognize Taiwan, including the Solomons and
Tonga. Most countries have diplomatic relations with China, which
preaches that Taiwan has no right to its own diplomatic relations.

Philippine stocks end mixed, peso slips
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks battled with
profit-taking for most of the session Friday to end generally
lower, but advancing blue chips still helped the market's main
index eke out a slight gain, traders said.
	   Losers beat gainers 48 to 40, with 38 issues unchanged.
	   Preliminary figures showed the 30-share Philippine Stock
Exchange Index inched up 3.05 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,859.24
after Thursday's 74.23-point surge.
	   In the last five trading days, the main index has gained 150.21
points, or 8.8 percent. Philippine financial markets were closed
Tuesday for President Joseph Estrada's inauguration.
	   The broader All Shares Index rose 1.72 points to 577.32 after an
18.03-point rise Thursday.
	   ``This rally still has quite a way to go. We see resistance
around 1,900 points,'' said Russel Ong, analyst for Anscor Hagedorn
Securities Inc.
	   But whether the gains can be sustained depends largely on how
Japan will act to rev up its slumping economy, he said. The yen has
led the way for other regional currencies in recent weeks.
	   ``We're looking closely at Japan,'' Ong said.
	   Hansley See, analyst for Abacus Securities Corp., said aside
from regional concerns, prospects of higher inflation and domestic
interest rates will also undercut stocks' current strength.
	   ``Higher inflation will make it difficult to bring down interest
rates,'' making fixed income instruments more attractive than
stocks, he said.
	   Just Monday, treasury bill rates jumped on reports that the
government's deficit is widening. Higher inflation could abet the
rise in t-bill yields.
	   In currency trading, the peso was slightly lower against the
dollar in quiet trading as the market awaited new developments in
regional currency markets, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 41.315 pesos at midday, little changed from
Thursday's average of 41.31 pesos.
	   Corporate demand for the U.S. currency was thin as buyers
awaited better buying levels before entering the market.
	   Dealers said the market was bracing for new developments in
Asian currency markets, in particular Japan. They said a possible
intervention by the Bank of Japan in the foreign exchange market to
prop up the yen could take place.
	   The local foreign exchange market stayed neutral to the
announcement by Japan late Thursday that it will establish a bridge
bank to take over the banking sector's bad loans, traders said.

Howard: International financial institutions talking down Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Friday hit out at international financial institutions for
``doomsday talk'' about the Asian financial crisis.
	   In a thinly veiled reference to senior World Bank official
Jean-Michel Severino's comments last month that Southeast Asia was
in danger of falling into depression, Howard said negative talk may
make the crisis worse.
	   ``There are too many visiting international spokesmen on the
economy who have responsibility to international financial
organizations and to nobody else, who indulge themselves with
doomsday negative talk visiting other countries,'' Howard said in a
radio interview.
	   ``They don't really serve the interests of the organizations
they work for and they certainly don't serve the interests of this
country.''
	   On June 16 at the Australia Summit conference in Melbourne,
Severino said East Asia had entered a period of deep and probably
long-lasting recession, and warned that a depression could follow.
	   Howard said Friday: ``There's too much negative talk around at
the present time.''
	   He said he does not believe Australia is sliding into recession.

Blair urges Northern Ireland to `hear voice of reason,' heads home

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony
Blair urged extremists to ``hear the voice of reason,'' but left
Northern Ireland with Protestant marchers and Catholic protesters
still on a stubborn collision course.
	   The Orange Order, Northern Ireland's conservative Protestant
brotherhood, is threatening to defy an official ban on its annual
parade this Sunday from the rural Drumcree Anglican church past
Catholic homes along the Garvaghy Road of Portadown.
	   Anti-Orange protesters there have sat down on the road for the
past three summers, forcing authorities to decide whose rights
should prevail. The confrontation has triggered widespread violence
each year, and appears to be doing so again.
	   While in Northern Ireland, Blair toured one of 10 Catholic
churches attacked overnight Wednesday by arsonists, then met with
key political and religious figures at the British government's
Stormont headquarters in east Belfast.
	   ``I'm not here to negotiate over the situation at Drumcree.
That's not something I can do. What I can do is ask people to
listen to the voice of reason,'' he said before the meetings.
	   Blair didn't meet with Orange leaders or the protesters.
	   As Blair left Northern Ireland about midnight, vandals
apparently retaliating for the church fires torched Altnaveigh
Orange Hall outside the predominantly Catholic town of Newry.
	   About an hour later, the fire brigade was called to a Catholic
school in Garvagh after an arson attack, which caused minor damage,
police said.
	   Arsonists later attacked a Protestant church in Londonderry,
causing minor damage. And in a separate incident, a building next
to a Protestant church in the same city was extensively damaged in
a blaze.
	   Police investigating the attacks in Londonderry arrested a
youth.

Investigators say police negligence allowed temple bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A presidential panel says negligent
police allowed Tamil rebels to bomb Sri Lanka's most revered
Buddhist shrine, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The committee appointed to investigate the Jan. 26 bombing of
the Temple of the Tooth said police officers tried to cover up
their lapses, according to the state-run Daily News. The newspaper
obtained a copy of the report, which has not been made public.
	   At least 18 people were killed and 12 injured in the bombing of
the temple where the faithful believe a tooth of the Buddha is
kept. The government blamed the main Tamil rebel group, the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, for the attack, which forced
authorities to change the venue for Sri Lanka's 50th independence
anniversary celebrations from the temple in Kandy to the capital,
Colombo, 95 kilometers (60 miles) to the west.
	   Tamil guerrillas say Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's population, need an independent homeland to protect against
oppression by the island nation's majority Sinhalese. More than
54,000 people have died in the insurrection since 1983.
	   The Daily News said police had intelligence reports that rebels
were planning an attack but failed to take adequate precautions.
	   The rebels drove a truck packed with explosives through at least
three police road blocks. The newspaper quoted the report as saying
police in Kandy falsified evidence and colluded to cover up their
negligence after the blast.
	   The defense ministry, which oversees the police in Sri Lanka,
will decide on any punishment for the officers.

Kashmiris move from border village to escape Pakistani shelling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Heavy shelling by Pakistani forces has
forced more than 2,000 villagers in Indian-held Kashmir to move to
safer areas. Homes and fields were damaged, and three policemen and
four civilians have been killed in the last few days, a government
official said Friday.
	   Mushtaq Ahmad Lone, junior interior minister in the Kashmir
state government, said many more villagers were likely to leave
their homes in Dawar, about 200 kilometers (120 miles) northwest of
the state capital, Srinagar.
	   Lone accused Pakistan of intensifying its bombardment to focus
world attention on the disputed territory of Kashmir. Since India
and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in May, Kashmir has been
portrayed as the root cause of tension that some fear could erupt
into nuclear war.
	   Pakistan has called for international mediation on Kashmir.
India rejects outside interference.
	   The neighbors have fought two wars over the predominantly Muslim
region since they gained independence from Britain in 1947. Two
thirds of Kashmir is held by India and the rest by Pakistan. Both
nations claim it all.
	   Displaced Indian Kashmiris are being fed and housed in
government camps until it is safe to return to their homes, Lone
said by telephone from Srinagar, 890 kilometers (550 miles) north
of New Delhi.
	   Brigadier General AK Chopra, also reached in Srinagar, said
Indian troops fired back in the two days of fighting. He said
monitoring of ambulance activity on the Pakistani side of the
border suggested that 25 Pakistani soldiers had been killed.
	   Pakistan has accused India of shelling civilian targets on its
side of the border, killing at least six people Tuesday and
flattening 25 homes.
	   Firing across the India-Pakistan border is routine, and both
sides accuse each other of targeting civilians and their homes.

out of danger after being beaten into a coma by more militant
Tamils during his visit to a jail, another lawmaker said Friday.
	   Douglas Devananda, secretary general of the Eelam People's
Democratic Party, suffered serious head injuries in the attack by
Tamil prisoners in Kalutara jail on Tuesday. He was visiting the
prison to inquire about their welfare.
	   ``He is showing all signs of improvement, and we are relieved,''
S. Sivadasan, an EPDP lawmaker, told The Associated Press. ``He
opened his eyes once and is breathing on his own without any
artificial help.''
	   The prison in Kalutara, a popular tourist beach destination 40
kilometers (25 miles) south of Colombo, is used largely to house
Tamil rebels or suspected militants.
	   Militants among Sri Lanka's Tamil minority are fighting for a
separate homeland in the north and east of the island nation
located off India's southern coast.
	   Tamil militants dislike Devananda, 40, because he now sides with
the government and advocates a peaceful settlement of the Tamil
homeland issue.
	   Devananda formed his party after quitting a rebel group in 1985.
He took part in the 1994 federal legislative elections, and his
group won nine seats in the 225-member house.
	   His party won 10 of 17 local council elections in the Tamil
heartland of Jaffna peninsula in January.

Palestinians lift siege on Jewish settlements after standoff

	   KFAR DAROM, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Palestinians lifted their
blockade of Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip on Friday morning,
ending a 12-hour standoff in which Israeli and Palestinian troops
had scuffled, screamed accusations and pointed guns at one another.
	   It was the most serious confrontation between the two sides in
two years, with Israeli troops bringing in armored personnel
carriers and the Palestinians blocking roads with truck convoys.
	   At one point, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
appealed to the U.S. Mideast peace envoy, Dennis Ross, and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, for help
in defusing the situation.
	   After all-night negotiations, a compromise was reached just
before dawn Friday.
	   The confrontation began with a seemingly routine argument over
the use of a road. About two-thirds of the Gaza Strip is controlled
by the Palestinian Authority, but Israeli troops patrol near Jewish
settlements and control several access roads.
	   On Thursday afternoon, Palestinian Supplies Minister Abdel Azziz
Shaheen demanded that Israel allow a convoy of 22 Palestinian cars
to use a coastal route it controls.
	   Israeli soldiers allowed Shaheen to use the road because as a
Cabinet minister he has special privileges, but asked the other
motorists to turn back. Shaheen insisted that all cars be allowed
to pass. Palestinian police rushed to the scene and a confrontation
with Israeli troops quickly ensued. The two sides angrily pushed
each other and pointed their weapons at one another.
	   At Kfar Darom junction, near the Jewish settlement of the same
name, Israeli troops stationed three APCs in the middle of a road
linking two major Gaza Strip cities. Hundreds of vehicles were
brought to a standstill for hours.
	   In retaliation, Palestinian police ordered dozens of trucks to
block access roads to Jewish settlements. Israel, in turn, sealed
off the Gaza Strip.
	   As the standoff dragged on, army bulldozers hauled in sand to
set-up extra military positions along the road, and Palestinian
police crouched in the fields just a few dozen meters away.
	   Under a compromise reached early Friday, the Palestinians agreed
to move the trucks from the settlement roads while Israel allowed
Shaheen and his convoy to drive along the coastal road.
	   Right-wing ministers in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
Cabinet accused the government of caving in to the Palestinians.
	   Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said the Palestinians were
mistaken if they believed they could wring concessions from Israel
with the threat of violence.
	   ``If the Palestinians want to advance their cause, the only way
to do so is around the negotiating table. The use and the threat of
violence, such thuggish behavior, will get them nowhere. On the
contrary, it will only lead them to failure,'' said Naveh.
	   There has been sporadic friction between Israeli soldiers and
Palestinian police in recent months. However, the recent standoff
was the tensest since September 1996, when scores of people were
killed in gunbattles between Israeli and Palestinian troops.

Bank approves dlrs 1 billion loan and official says dlrs 6 billion
</HEADLINE>
more may be on the way

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The World Bank has approved a dlrs 1 billion
loan for Indonesia and a bank official said the International
Monetary Fund was working on a dlrs 6 billion package of loans for
the Jakarta government that is expected to be ready in a matter of
weeks.
	   Dennis de Tray, the bank's country director for Indonesia, said
Thursday that dlrs 600 million of the dlrs 1 billion loan already
had been disbursed after the board of directors approved it. He
said he saw no difficulty in Indonesia fulfilling the conditions to
receive the remaining dlrs 400 million, probably in September.
	   The bank said the loan will be used to provide balance of
payment support while the government carries out reforms aimed at
overcoming the country's financial crisis, restoring economic
growth and protecting the poor by financing imports of such staples
as rice and soybeans.
	   De Tray said the bank's action followed recent decisions the
Asian Development Bank and the Japanese Export-Import Bank to
provide Indonesia with financial help.
	   Asia's financial crisis has hit Indonesia the hardest of all,
with the value of its currency, the rupiah, dropping more than 80
percent in the past 11 months. Inflation and unemployment are
soaring as hundreds of companies find themselves unable to cope
with huge debt. The economy is expected to shrink by 10 percent
this year.
	   ``The budget needs of Indonesia are extremely substantial at
this time. Revenues have collapsed and subsidies bills are growing
extremely rapidly. Subsidy growth, we all accept, is necessary to
keep the lid on,'' de Tray said, referring to the need to provide
basic food products and fuel at low government-supported prices in
order to prevent civil unrest.
	   ``We and the IMF are looking for around dlrs 6 billion of
additional financing to complete the package, de Tray said.
``Discussions are under way and they are at a critical stage.
	   The IMF and Indonesia announced agreement June 25 on a revised
rescue program that put a dlrs 43 billion bailout package back on
track, the fourth time the program has been revised since last
October.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A retired general who had become a prominent
member of parliament has been shot dead at his country residence,
officials said Friday.
	   Lev Rokhlin, a staunch critic of President Boris Yeltsin, was
found dead early Friday morning at his dacha near the town of
Naro-Fominsk, 60 kilometers (40 miles) southwest of Moscow. He was
shot in the head with his own gun, police and security officials
said.
	   Rokhlin's wife was in shock when police arrived, the Interfax
news agency reported. There were no signs of a forced entry, it
said.
	   Russia's Federal Security Service, which was investigating the
killing along with police, said were ``no political reasons behind
the death,'' news agencies reported.
	   Russia's NTV television station reported cited the security
service as saying that all information regarding the shooting would
be classified, and no details would be released.
	   Rokhlin used his parliamentary position to launch the Movement
in Support of the Army last year, an anti-government organization
that sought to ``dump the hated regime'' of President Boris
Yeltsin.
	   Rokhlin, 51, was a general during the 1994-96 war in Chechnya.
He was one of the few Russian military figures to win high praise
for his performance in the conflict which resulted in an
embarrassing defeat for the Russian forces.
	   After leaving the military, he won election to parliament with a
pro-Yeltsin faction. But he broke with Yeltsin in 1996 and began
fiercely opposing the president's plans for military reforms.
	   Rokhlin drew support among current and former Russian servicemen
who were upset by the military's decline in recent years. However,
extent of Rokhlin's following remained unclear.

Indonesian government moves against Suharto foundations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Paring back the economic legacy of
former President Suharto, the government said Friday that
charitable foundations _ many controlled by his family _ will be
stripped of state support.
	   Under Suharto, more than a dozen foundations linked to him
reaped a special tax on civil servants and enjoyed other
privileges. Now they are being investigated amid accusations that
the Suharto clan was guilty of illegally accumulating wealth.
	   Suharto, who ruled Indonesia with an authoritarian grip for 32
years, quit in May after student protests for his ouster and riots
over price increases.
	   New President B.J. Habibie has issued a decree revoking
Suharto-era rules on the establishment of foundations, said
Hartarto Sastrosunarto, the Cabinet minister in charge of
development.
	   The foundations may still function but are no longer entitled to
government facilities that help them run, Hartarto said. The
measure will boost economic efficiency, he said.
	   The attorney general's office is expected to finish auditing
foundations set up by Suharto and his family within three or four
months.
	   The Suharto family built up a big business empire over the years
that critics say contributed to Indonesia's economic crisis because
of its monopolistic practices. Prices and unemployment are rising
rapidly.

Planned visit to East Timor by UN envoy in doubt due to violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo JAK103
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Plans by a U.N. envoy to visit East
Timor this month are in doubt following an upsurge in violent
protests in the troubled territory.
	   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Friday he would
consider the ``pros and the cons'' of a proposed visit by U.N.
diplomat Jamsheed Marker, who is trying to broker a peace plan for
the former Portuguese colony.
	   Last week two pro-independence protesters were shot to death and
others were wounded when Indonesian troops tried to quell two
separate demonstrations.
	   One victim was killed near a Roman Catholic cathedral where
three ambassadors from the European Union were holding talks with a
local bishop in the town of Baucau.
	   The EU team was forced to leave East Timor earlier than
scheduled Tuesday after continuous protests and clashes between
rival East Timor groups either for or against Indonesian rule.
	   Alatas said Indonesian authorities had been worried before the
EU went to East Timor that their presence might result in violence
and that similar protests were likely if Marker went.
	   ``It is not that we don't want to see people visit East Timor.
But we think it is a particularly sensitive stage now,'' Alatas
said in reference to new efforts to end a long running guerrilla
war and an international dispute over the status of East Timor.
	   ``At this particular stage especially, it appears to be
inevitable that people would want to go into the streets,'' he
said.
	   Alatas said demonstrations could not be prevented.
	   Marker, who has been chairing U.N.-sponsored talks between
Indonesia and Portugal, is due to come to Jakarta in mid-July for
talks and had been planning to visit East Timor as well.
	   In March 1997, troops shot two pro-independence demonstrators to
death and 38 others were wounded when activists tried to see Marker
at his hotel on a previous visit to East Timor.
	   Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed East Timor in 1976. Since
then, it has fought a small band of rebels and has been frequently
accused of human rights abuses.
	   In recent weeks East Timorese activists have stepped up their
campaign for a vote on independence in the wake of the resignation
in May of President Suharto, who sent troops to invade the
territory 23 years ago.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, has pledged
democratic reform in Indonesia.
	   He has offered to grant special status to East Timor and to
release a jailed guerrilla commander in return for international
recognition of Indonesia's sovereignty over the territory. But he
has ruled out a referendum.

Cambodian leader Hun Sen denies he's a `monster'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROLANG KEN, Cambodia (AP) _ Accused by critics of using violence
and fear to win elections July 26, Cambodian leader Hun Sen
presented a softer side Friday as a sentimental songwriter and
insisted he is no ``monster.''
	   Visiting an irrigation system 25 kilometers (15 miles) west of
the capital, Phnom Penh, Hun Sen told a group of villagers that he
has composed more than 100 songs, many about love and his difficult
peasant childhood, that sometimes make him weep.
	   ``It is a big misunderstanding to call Hun Sen a monster,'' Hun
Sen said. ``I never call myself a strongman. Strongman is what
other people call me, and neither am I a stubborn man.''
	   Hun Sen took nearly full control of Cambodia a year ago by
deposing Prince Norodom Ranariddh, with whom he served a tense
co-premiership after U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993. The prince
returned from exile in March.
	   About 100 of the prince's supporters were killed in the months
that followed the coup. A U.N. human-rights report Wednesday said
that four apparently political killings rank among 140 reported
cases of violence and intimidation investigated since mid-May.
	   Hun Sen has called the new elections to win back international
aid and legitimacy lost because of his takeover, but critics say
his Cambodian People's Party is terrorizing opponents and has
stacked the electoral bodies in his favor.
	   Also Friday, the U.S. Embassy issued a warning for U.S. citizens
to take special precautions during the anniversary July 5-7 of
bloody street battles and looting that accompanied last year's
coup.
	   The embassy said Americans ``should avoid political gatherings
or demonstrations, avoid the vicinity of political party or
military buildings or compounds and exercise caution in crowds of
any sort.''
	   Hun Sen told the villagers he is a monster only when it comes to
fighting poverty and asked them to not harm opposition supporters
on election day _ even if they walk on roads he helped build.
	   ``I beg you not to do this,'' Hun Sen said. ``Let them exercise
the right to chose party they support, and it is also the right of
our supporters to choose our party.''
	   ``If they curse you, just walk away,'' Hun Sen said.
	   Hun Sen, who has barely campaigned in the elections, preferring
to let his opponents weaken each other, asked supporters to refrain
from drinking alcohol on election day to avoid trouble.
	   Drinking later that night, presuably to celebrate victory, would
be all right, he said.

One student killed in clash with security personnel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian security personnel shot and
killed a student in a clash Friday at a university campus in Irian
Jaya, the western half of New Guinea, a news report said.
	   The official Antara news agency said law student Steven
Suripatti was shot in the head when protesters attacked a
plainclothes military intelligence officer.
	   The officer and a female student were hospitalized, Antara said.
	   Security officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   Trouble erupted when students staged a pro-independence rally at
Cendrawasih University, about 12 kilometers (8 miles) outside of
Irian Jaya's capital, Jayapura.
	   It was the third consecutive day of anti-Indonesian protest in
the province.
	   On Wednesday hundreds of people staged an rally outside of the
provincial Parliament in Jayapura, about 3,700 kilometers (2,312
miles) east of Jakarta.
	   On Thursday, security personnel fired rubber bullets to stop a
rampage by about 2,000 protesters in Sorong, 1,080 kilometers (675
miles) northwest of Jayapura.
	   A university student was severely injured, along with about 20
security personnel who were hurt by rocks.
	   Also on Thursday, police fired warning shots at a rock throwing
mob in Jayapura. They arrested 41 people.
	   Indonesia annexed Irian Jaya, a former Dutch colony, in 1963.
	   A small rebel group called the Free West Papua Movement has been
fighting a guerrilla war in its remote jungles since then and
protests against Indonesian rule sometimes flare.

Imelda Marcos insists on burying husband at heroes' cemetery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Former first lady Imelda Marcos said
Friday she will insist that the remains of her husband, dictator
Ferdinand Marcos, be buried in a heroes' cemetery, a plan that has
reopened old wounds and divided Filipinos.
	   Facing loud opposition to the burial plans, President Joseph
Estrada last week urged Mrs. Marcos to follow the advice of the
country's Roman Catholic bishops to bury her husband's remains in
his northern Philippine hometown of Batac.
	   Mrs. Marcos on Friday resisted Estrada's suggestion.
	   ``Who will die for our country? Who will fight for our country
if you will just put him in the backyard of his house?'' she said.
	   The body of Marcos is on display in a glass coffin inside an
air-conditioned crypt at his mansion in Batac, about 410 (255
miles) north of Manila.
	   Marcos died in Honolulu in 1989, three years after a ``people
power'' revolt toppled his 20-year rule, and his body was brought
back to the Philippines in 1993.
	   Mrs. Marcos says her husband's dying wish was to be buried at
Heroes' Cemetery, which is reserved for former soldiers.
	   Both former President Fidel Ramos and his predecessor, Corazon
Aquino, refused to let Marcos be buried at the heroes' cemetery
because it could trigger clashes between his supporters and
opponents.
	   Several weeks before taking office as the Philippines' 13th
president last Tuesday, Estrada, a supporter of Marcos, announced
he would allow Marcos to be buried there.
	   His announcement immediately drew widespread protests from
groups that had opposed Marcos that threatened to erode the new
president's popularity.
	   Amid the protests, Mrs. Marcos backed postponed the planned
burial. Estrada later asked her to bury her husband in Batac.
	   Mrs. Marcos her family would wait ``for an appropriate time''
for the burial and criticized those opposing it, including Aquino
and Marxist guerrillas, who have threatened to ``arrest'' the
Marcoses to make them pay for ``crimes against the people.''
	   Mrs. Marcos said her husband was a war hero and deserved to be
buried at Heroes' Cemetery. She also said there was no law
prohibiting her husband's internment there.
	   ``I'm just trying to do what is right,'' Mrs. Marcos told
reporters at her house in suburban San Juan, tears welling in her
eyes. ``And there is always a right time to do the right thing.''
	   The Marcoses have been accused of amassing billions of dollars
of alleged ill-gotten wealth during Marcos' 20-year presidency. The
Marcos government also has been charged with torturing and
murdering dissidents.

Thai Finance Ministry to sell Exxon stake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Finance Ministry plans to
sell all of its 12.5 percent stake in Esso (Thailand) PCL, a unit
of the U.S.-based Exxon Corp., to raise fund for the cash-strapped
government, a Cabinet minister said.
	   The ministry, which bought the stake in 1994, wants to sell it
back to the parent company, energy affairs chief Savit Bhodivihok
said late Thursday night.
	   Esso (Thailand) was a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon until the
Finance Ministry bought the stake. But in the past year, the
once-booming Thai economy has foundered in the Asian financial
crisis and the government is short of cash.
	   Savit said he expected the Finance Ministry to settle the
purchase terms with Exxon in September. He did not say how much the
Finance Ministry had paid for the stake.
	   The economic crisis has deeply cut the Thai government's tax
revenue and the government is expected to generate a budget deficit
equal to 3 percent of gross domestic product this year.

South Korean labor group urges more strikes amid restructuring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Threats of labor unrest soared Friday
after the government announced it will privatize 11 state-owned
corporations to increase efficiency and attract solely needed
foreign investment.
	   The militant Korean Confederation of Trade Unions called for a
new wave of strikes to fight increased restructuring and layoffs
and also demanded a freeze on South Korea's annual dlrs 2.8 billion
in arms purchases.
	   Responding to the strike call, workers at Hyundai Motors Co.,
South Korea's largest automaker, said they will walk off the
assembly lines for two days from Monday, as a prelude to a bigger
strike later this month.
	   The government said earlier in the day it will sell off its
26.7-percent stake in Pohang Iron and Steel Co., the world's No. 2
steel maker, beginning this month.
	   It will also phase out its large holdings in three companies _
telephone giant Korea Telecom, the blue-chip Korea Electric Power
Corp. and cigarette monopoly Korea Tobacco and Ginseng Corp. _ by
2002.
	   ``The restructuring will wipe out bubbles and inefficiency,''
said Jin Nyum, head of the government's Planning and Budge
Commission. He said the privatization will draw up to dlrs 8
billion to South Korea by next year.
	   The announcement followed the government-ordered closure earlier
this week of five financially unstable banks. The latest move was
expected to prod more restructuring in other industries, part of
the government's effort to restore the confidence of foreign
investors in South Korea's shattered economy.
	   For years, bloated state-run enterprises have been accused of
corruption and redundant manpower. They often set up numerous
subsidiaries, filling top posts with retiring government officials.
	   Restructuring South Korea's inefficient industries is a key
condition set by the International Monetary Fund, which bailed out
the country's economy late last year.
	   But South Korean workers, accustomed to lifetime employment,
fear that such privatization would lead to large layoffs.
	   ``The government must immediately stop the restructuring that
kills our livelihood,'' said the labor confederation, which claims
a membership of 500,000 in state-run companies, banks, the
automobile and other heavy industries.
	   Auto and other metal workers will go on a nationwide strike on
July 14, followed the next day by a work stoppage in state-run
companies and major commercial banks, the group said.
	   It said it will organize a rally of 200,000 workers in Seoul
next week in a show of force.
	   Unemployment is rising rapidly in South Korea. Government
figures show that the number of jobless people has doubled to
nearly 1.5 million and will likely top 2 million by the end of the
year.
	   In a separate news conference, the group demanded the government
suspend new weapons purchases until the economic crisis subsides,
despite Defense Ministry insistence the financial crisis should not
hurt military readiness against communist North Korea.

San Miguel chairman resigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Andress Soriano III has resigned as
chairman of San Miguel Corp., the Philippines' largest food and
beverage conglomerate, the company announced Friday.
	   San Miguel said Soriano resigned on Thursday to ``give way to a
new management'' after 12 years at the helm of the company.
	   Soriano became chairman of San Miguel in 1986 when former
President Corazon Aquino took power and seized San Miguel shares
alleged to be part of the ill-gotten wealth of her cousin, business
tycoon Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.
	   Cojuangco, who headed the company before Soriano took over, is
challenging the seizure of the shares.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ahead of new talks Friday with U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke, President Slobodan Milosevic denied
Yugoslav and Serb forces are involved in repressive actions against
civilians in Kosovo.
	   Milosevic, who has rejected international demands that he cease
his military campaign in the independence-minded province of Serbia
and withdraw his forces, reiterated that talks should begin
immediately with ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   ``There can be no other path to solving the crisis'' in Kosovo,
Belgrade media quoted him as saying at a meeting with two top aides
Thursday.
	   Despite the crackdown that has driven tens of thousands of
ethnic Albanians from their villages, the independent FoNet news
agency quoted him as saying: ``There are not, nor will there be any
repressive actions against the civilian population in Kosovo.''
	   Hours before Holbrooke was scheduled to fly to Belgrade to meet
with Milosevic, a remote-controlled bomb exploded early Friday in a
Serb residential area of Kosovo's capital Pristina, damaging
several cars.
	   No injuries were reported, but the blast underscored high
tensions and the difficulties Holbrooke faces in trying to arrange
a cease-fire between Serb forces and Kosovo militants.
	   A police officer at the scene who refused to give his name
blamed the Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Yugoslav fighter jets on Friday repeatedly flew low over
Pristina, repeating a tactic of the past few days that ethnic
Albanians say is an attempt to intimidate them.
	   There were reports of renewed clashes Friday in the crossroads
village of Kijevo about 25 kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina.
Serb forces have been fighting to break the siege of KLA fighters
who surrounded and cut off the Serb village in mid-June. This week,
Holbrooke called Kijevo ``the most dangerous place in Europe.''
	   Friday's scheduled meeting with Milosevic in the Yugoslav
capital Belgrade is part of intense diplomatic efforts to end the
violence in Kosovo, where hundreds of people have died in recent
months. Milosevic says the crackdown is aimed at Albanian
terrorists who have targeted Serb police and civilians in their
militant campaign for independence.
	   NATO officials have said they reserve the option to use military
force if all else fails. But the alliance's top leader insisted
Thursday that he prefers a diplomatic solution, warning that the
mistakes of earlier Balkan conflicts must be avoided in the
strife-torn province.
	   Secretary-General Javier Solana's support for peacemaking
efforts came just hours after the U.S. Embassy in the Yugoslav
capital of Belgrade announced that a new diplomatic monitoring
mission will start Monday. The mission will include American,
Russian, Austrian and Polish diplomats.
	   The diplomats will observe freedom of movement, which has been
hampered both by Serb police blocking access to regions where
anti-guerrilla operations are taking place, and Kosovo Albanian
fighters extending their grip in the central part of the province.

Clinton, in Hong Kong, links economic prosperity to democracy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new material;, Clinton's news conference
scheduled for 0900 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA MYERS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Extolling Hong Kong as China's ``window on the
world,'' U.S. President Bill Clinton concluded a historic Far East
tour Friday by challenging its leaders to set the pace for rescuing
Asia from the region's financial crisis.
	   The president, who met with pro-democracy leader Martin Lee and
others, also declared that the future prosperity of Hong Kong,
China and all nations will depend on promoting political freedoms
to spur economic success.
	   ``Societies with the free flow of ideas are most likely to be
both successful and stable in the new century,'' Clinton told
business and community leaders in this city of high rises and high
expectations.
	   ``I look forward to the day when all of the people of Hong Kong
realize the rights and responsibilities of full democracy,''
Clinton said.
	   The president, who during his nine-day China tour repeatedly
touted the idea that human rights and economic progress go hand in
hand, said countries will be left behind if they constrain their
citizens.
	   ``I think the forces of history will move all visionary people,
including Asians with their legendary assets of hard work,
intelligence, and education, toward freer, more democratic
societies,'' Clinton said.
	   He expressed confidence that Hong Kong, while grappling with its
own economic woes amid Asia's currency crisis, ``can help Asia out
of turbulent times as it contributes to China's astonishing
transformation.''
	   ``I am confident Hong Kong will get through this,'' Clinton
said, speaking from a gull-shaped convention center, the site of
the July 1, 1997 ceremony where the Union Jack was lowered and
China's red flag was raised to resume mainland control after 156
years of British rule.
	   Clinton praised China for not devaluing its currency _ a move
that could worsen its neighbors' economic woes _ and Japan for
announcing a plan to revive its moribund economy by granting the
government power to take over failed banks and spend more than dlrs
200 billion to protect depositors and businesses.
	   Taking aim at the roots of Asia's economic problems, he
cautioned against the creation of prosperity on the ``shaky
foundations of cronyism, corruption and overextended credit.''
	   In a show of support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy politicians
and reformers, the president met with de facto opposition leader
Lee and several others among the 20 legislators who won recent
legislative elections.
	   Lee expressed gratitude to Clinton for coming to China and
speaking directly about human rights and democracy, particularly in
Hong Kong.
	   Lee said the first year of the transition _ which some feared
would reduce civil and economic freedoms _ had gone well, but that,
like Clinton, he believes the pace of democratic reforms should be
accelerated. His remarks during the private meeting with Clinton
were relayed by Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser.
	   The president had dinner Thursday with Tung Chee-hwa, Hong
Kong's Beijing-appointed chief executive, who assured Clinton that
the port city would keep its thriving autonomy.
	   Political freedom was a major theme of Clinton's trip, the first
China visit by an American president since the 1989 Tiananmen
Square crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators disrupted
U.S.-China relations.

<TEXT>
	   UTSUNOMIYA, Japan (AP) _ To kick off his reelection campaign in
this rural community just north of Tokyo, lawmaker Tetsuro Yano
chose a man whom few voters these days would admit to even liking _
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   Just one week before crucial elections are to be held for the
upper house of Japan's bicameral Parliament, the polls have
Hashimoto at his lowest popularity ratings ever.
	   But instead of being the kiss of death, associating with
Hashimoto is still seen as a sure-fire way to pull in the votes.
And, as Yano's stumping tour demonstrated, Hashimoto's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party is anything but a lame duck.
	   ``Having Hashimoto here means the LDP is behind Yano. That's
what Yano needs to win,'' said Masayuki Hotta, a 32-year-old
mechanic who joined thousands of supporters at the rally here on
Wednesday, one of the first since campaigning officially opened.
	   At a campaign news conference on Friday after a rally for
another candidate in southern Japan, Hashimoto for the first time
voiced support for permanent tax cuts to revive the moribund
economy _ and win some points with voters.
	   Going into the final campaign weekend before the July 12
elections, the LDP is plauged by bribery scandals, broken campaign
promises and an economy in its worst recession since World War II.
	   But with Japan's numerous opposition parties in disarray and
most voters unlikely even to show up at the polls, LDP members say
the party's proven ability to deliver pork to rural areas like
Utsunomiya is enough to maintain its current strength.
	   Hashimoto's party now holds 118 of the upper house's 252 seats.
The polls will be the first upper house elections since Hashimoto
came to power in early 1996.
	   Though the LDP lost its majority in the upper house in 1989, it
controls the Cabinet because it has 262 of the 500 seats in the
more powerful lower house.
	   These elections, however, may be a chance for the LDP to regain
its dual majority.
	   ``We're looking for a majority in the upper house,'' said
Toshikazu Masubuchi, a prefectural legislator working for Yano's
campaign.
	   That would not be a victory without irony.
	   Hashimoto's approval rating has recently plunged to 30 percent _
the lowest since he took office.
	   Along with growing concern over the laggard economy, Hashimoto's
liabilities include an unfulifilled promise made during elections
in 1996 to rein in Japan's enormous budget deficit, now the largest
in the industrial world.
	   As the opposition is loudly noting, the LDP goes into the
election having just passed the biggest pork spending bill in
Japanese history, worth 16.7 trillion yen (dlrs 119 billion).
	   But, in Japan, pork and politics are a winning menu.
	   The LDP has used public largesse to help keep itself almost
continually in power since the party was formed in 1955.
	   The LDP made sure public funds flowed into rural areas, blessing
them with brand new swimming pools, highways and schools lacking in
cities like Tokyo. In exchange, leaders of local agricultural
cooperatives and other groups delivered votes and campaign
volunteers.
	   Many of the dozens of men who handed out flyers at Yano's rally
said they were not party members, and none could say where the LDP
stood on national issues.
	   Still, all said they would vote for Yano.
	   For many, opposition parties fail to offer a viable alternative.
Most seem to oppose LDP just for the sake of opposing it, or voice
platforms that are similar to the LDP anyway.
	   ``All parties sound the same,'' said Toshimitsu Ueno, 62.
	   The opposition parties' strongest support will likely come from
urban areas. But LDP lawmakers confidently predict most voters
there who are turned off by the ruling party will not vote at all.
	   Hajime Funada, an LDP lower house lawmaker, estimates that voter
turnout will be the lowest in recent years _ less than 50 percent.
	   ``Disenchanted voters tend not to vote,'' he said.

Central Asian nations seek nuclear-free zone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) _ Russia, China and three Central Asian
nations called Friday for a nuclear-free zone in this region and
expressed concern over the recent nuclear tests in Pakistan and
India.
	   The five-nation summit focused on regional security issues and
efforts to prevent an arms buildup in Central Asia. After gaining
independence in 1991, Kazakstan gave up the nuclear weapons it
inherited from the Soviet Union, and does not want to see them
re-introduced.
	   ``We are particularly concerned about the recent series of
underground nuclear explosions by India and Pakistan,'' said
Kazakstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev. The tests ``not only
worsened the relationship between these countries, but also the
situation on the Asian continent.''
	   The foreign ministers from the nations at the summit _ Russia,
China, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan _ signed a joint
declaration calling for an end to the nuclear arms race in Asia.
They also called for the prevention of any national or religious
separatism in their countries.
	   China is concerned about independence demands by some members of
the the Uighurs, an ethnic minority in western China. There is also
a sizable Uighur population in Kazakstan.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin said the five nations at the
summit needed to work together against any threats to the stability
of the region.
	   During the Soviet era, there were often tensions along the
Soviet-Chinese border. In recent years, the five nations have been
meeting regularly to improve relations and introduce
confidence-building measures, such as troop reductions, along their
borders.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who was filling in
for Russian leader Boris Yeltsin, noted that the tensions between
India and Pakistan were related to a dispute over land and borders
in the Kashmir region. He said Central Asian nations should not
allow the same thing to happen in their region.

Ethiopia voices disappointment over `groundless' U.N. criticism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Ethiopia on Friday rejected as ``absolutely
groundless'' criticism by the U.N.'s top human rights official of
its expulsion of Eritrean nationals.
	   Mary Robinson on Wednesday urged Ethiopia to stop the practice,
saying she was particularly disturbed by the practice of stamping
Eritreans' passports with the words ``expelled, never to return.''
	   ``The rationale is security considerations,'' said a statement
from the Ethiopian mission to U.N. agencies in Geneva. The measures
were taken with full respect for ``the safety and dignity of the
individual'' and international law, it said.
	   They applied only to ``those Eritreans in Ethiopia who have been
engaged in mobilizing funds to finance Eritrean aggression and
those involved in espionage and other clandestine activities'' as
Eritrean agents, the statement continued.
	   Ethiopia has so far forced more than 2,520 of the 550,000
Eritreans living in the country to return to Eritrea.
	   Fighting which escalated on May 6 has claimed hundreds of lives.
The International Committee of the Red Cross says 60,000 Eritreans
have been displaced by the fighting.
	   The U.N. Security Council demanded last Friday that both sides
halt the conflict. It endorsed efforts by African leaders to end
the border conflict peacefully.

Palestinians lift siege on Jewish settlements after standoff
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details of standoff resolved &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KFAR DAROM, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinians lifted their blockade
of Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip on Friday morning, ending a
12-hour standoff in which Israeli and Palestinian troops had
scuffled, screamed accusations and pointed guns at one another.
	   It was the most serious confrontation between the two sides in
two years, with Israeli troops bringing in armored personnel
carriers and the Palestinians blocking roads with truck convoys.
	   At one point, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
appealed to the U.S. Mideast peace envoy, Dennis Ross, and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, for help
in defusing the situation.
	   After all-night negotiations, a compromise was reached just
before dawn Friday.
	   The confrontation began with a seemingly routine argument over
the use of a road. About two-thirds of the Gaza Strip is controlled
by the Palestinian Authority, but Israeli troops patrol near Jewish
settlements and control several access roads.
	   On Thursday afternoon, Palestinian Supplies Minister Abdel Azziz
Shaheen demanded that Israel allow a convoy of 22 Palestinian cars
to use a coastal route it controls.
	   Israeli soldiers allowed Shaheen to use the road because as a
Cabinet minister he has special privileges, but they ordered the
other motorists to turn back, for reasons that were not immediately
clear. Shaheen insisted that all cars be allowed to pass.
Palestinian police rushed to the scene and a confrontation with
Israeli troops quickly ensued. The two sides angrily pushed each
other and pointed their weapons at one another.
	   At Kfar Darom junction, near the Jewish settlement of the same
name, Israeli troops stationed three APCs in the middle of a road
linking two major Gaza Strip cities. Hundreds of vehicles were
brought to a standstill for hours.
	   In retaliation, Palestinian police ordered dozens of trucks to
block access roads to Jewish settlements. Israel, in turn, sealed
off the Gaza Strip.
	   As the standoff dragged on, army bulldozers hauled in sand to
form extra military positions along the road, and Palestinian
police crouched in the fields just a few dozen meters (yards) away.
	   Under a compromise reached early Friday, the Palestinians agreed
to move the trucks from the settlement roads while Israel allowed
Shaheen and his convoy to drive along the coastal road.
	   Right-wing ministers in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
Cabinet accused the government of caving in to the Palestinians.
	   Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said the Palestinians were
mistaken if they believed they could wring concessions from Israel
with the threat of violence.
	   ``If the Palestinians want to advance their cause, the only way
to do so is around the negotiating table. The use and the threat of
violence, such thuggish behavior, will get them nowhere. On the
contrary, it will only lead them to failure,'' said Naveh.
	   There has been sporadic friction between Israeli soldiers and
Palestinian police in recent months. However, the recent standoff
was the tensest since September 1996, when scores of people were
killed in gunbattles between Israeli and Palestinian troops.

Japan moves toward tax cuts after bank crisis plan released
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A day after announcing a long-awaited plan for
dealing with Japan's banking crisis, leaders signaled their
readiness Friday to follow up with permanent a tax cut to jump
start the country's moribund economy.
	   Such a move would both take advantage of momentum generated by
the new ``bridge bank'' financial stabilization plan and answer
calls from the United States and other trading partners for bolder
stimulus measures.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, speaking at a campaign rally
ahead of parliamentary elections on July 12, indicated for the
first time his support for permanent tax relief instead of the
current policy favoring one-time tax breaks.
	   ``I hope we will have not temporary tax cuts, but so-called
permanent tax reforms. I think we'll move in that direction,'' he
said.
	   Hashimoto's remarks were echoed by Kan Kato, the head of an
influential government tax research panel, who called for tax cuts
now that the ``bridge bank'' system has been formally adopted.
	   A chief lieutenant in Hashimoto's ruling party, Koichi Kato,
said Friday that legislation for making the bridge bank package
into law will likely pass Parliament by early September, Kyodo News
reported.
	   The proposal, which calls for closing troubled lenders while
providing bridge loans to clients dependent on financing from the
banks, was reported with banner headlines in Friday morning papers.
	   But it received a cool reception from some.
	   While many observers said it was a long overdue measure, critics
pointed to the vague criteria and questioned whether it could be
effectively implemented.
	   ``The bridge bank scheme is little more than a first step toward
financial revitalization,'' said an editorial Friday in the Nihon
Keizai, Japan's leading business daily.
	   The Asahi newspaper demanded an overhaul of the plan in its
editorial, calling it a bailout for reckless bank executives and
uncreditworthy borrowers.
	   In Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said the
measures were ``potentially significant steps toward addressing its
(Japan's) banking problems.'' He urged Japan to act quickly to
carry out the plan.
	   But a senior U.S. Treasury official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that market confidence could only be regained
``through timetables and concrete actions.''
	   In early Tokyo trading Friday, Japanese stocks sank and the
dollar rose against the yen amid disappointment Thursday's
announcement included few surprises _ and no mention of tax cuts.
	   The dollar later weakened and Tokyo stocks closed mixed on word
of the possible permanent tax cuts.
	   Despite growing calls for extended tax cuts from many economists
and investors, Hashimoto had previously resisted going beyond
temporary tax relief measures due to fears of ballooning the
deficit.
	   Long-term tax cuts would clash with a pledge made by Hashimoto
at the outset of his 2 1/2-year old administration to rein in
Japan's government deficit, a key plank in his policy platform.
	   But the Japanese economy's drift into its worst recession since
World War II and pressure ahead of the upcoming polls for the upper
house of Parliament appears to have changed the political calculus.
	   The government's balance sheet has actually deteriorated in
recent months as the sluggish economy erodes tax revenue.
	   Japan's deficit for the fiscal year ended in March is expected
to have grown to 1.5 trillion yen (dlrs 11 billion), far above a
previous estimate in June of 1 trillion yen (dlrs 7 billion), the
Nihon Keizai reported in its evening edition.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ahead of new talks Friday with U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke, President Slobodan Milosevic denied
Yugoslav and Serb forces are involved in repressive actions against
civilians in Kosovo.
	   Milosevic, who has rejected international demands that he cease
his military campaign in the independence-minded province of Serbia
and withdraw his forces, reiterated that talks should begin
immediately with ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   ``There can be no other path to solving the crisis'' in Kosovo,
Belgrade media quoted him as saying at a meeting with two top aides
Thursday.
	   Despite the crackdown that has driven tens of thousands of
ethnic Albanians from their villages, the independent FoNet news
agency quoted him as saying: ``There are not, nor will there be any
repressive actions against the civilian population in Kosovo.''
	   Hours before Holbrooke was scheduled to fly to Belgrade to meet
with Milosevic, a remote-controlled bomb exploded early Friday in a
Serb residential area of Kosovo's capital Pristina, damaging
several cars.
	   No injuries were reported, but the blast underscored high
tensions and the difficulties Holbrooke faces in trying to arrange
a cease-fire between Serb forces and Kosovo militants.
	   A police officer at the scene who refused to give his name
blamed the Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Yugoslav fighter jets on Friday repeatedly flew low over
Pristina, repeating a tactic of the past few days that ethnic
Albanians say is an attempt to intimidate them.
	   There were reports of renewed clashes Friday in the crossroads
village of Kijevo about 25 kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina.
Serb forces have been fighting to break the siege of KLA fighters
who surrounded and cut off the Serb village in mid-June. This week,
Holbrooke called Kijevo ``the most dangerous place in Europe.''
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center said Serb police had taken
control of Kijevo Friday morning. The report could not immediately
be confirmed.

Turkish government, military at odds in fight against radical

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Remarks by a top general have pitted the
military against the government in their struggle to reach a shared
goal: curbing the rise of radical Islam in traditionally secular
Turkey.
	   The military forced the country's first Islamic government out
of office last year and has since pushed the new Cabinet to carry
out measures curtailing Islamic politics. But the government,
pro-secular and generally subservient to the military's wishes, has
been unusually critical of comments this week by a top general.
	   Gen. Cevik Bir, deputy chief of general staff, warned that the
pro-Islamic Virtue Party enjoys too much popular support and
reiterated that fundamentalism is Turkey's No. 1 threat.
	   Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit accused Bir of boosting the morale
of the Islamic Virtue Party before next year's general elections by
publicly commenting that the party is leading in opinion polls.
	   The poll cited by Bir indicated that, were the election held
today, Virtue would win 17.4 percent of votes, with Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz's center-right Motherland finishing second with 16.7,
according to the English-language Turkish Daily News. It did not
provide a margin of error, but such a close showing could be
statistically insignificant.
	   Virtue's predecessor, the Islamic Welfare Party, won the 1995
elections with 21 percent. It was shut down earlier this year for
supporting a religious-based regime.
	   Bir, speaking Monday at a ceremony for the opening of a new
military education center in Ankara, also called on Parliament to
approve a series of laws designed to curb Islam's influence. The
military, he clearly indicated, would stick to its unwavering
pro-secular position.
	   Ecevit blasted such tactics, saying: ``Fundamentalism cannot be
prevented by limiting democracy, but only by strengthening it.''
	   Still, in line with the military's wishes, a parliamentary
commission approved a draft law Thursday to discharge anti-secular
civil servants. It was not clear when the bill will be debated in
Parliament.
	   Turkey is predominantly Muslim, though it has a long tradition
of maintaining a secular government.
	   Yilmaz also voiced his displeasure with Bir's speech, though
less forcefully. ``There are people in Turkey who should not make
such assessments,'' he said Thursday.
	   The last time Yilmaz dared to criticize the army, he was
publicly embarrassed by a curt rebuke from the generals.
	   In Turkey, the military's top brass participate in the National
Security Council, whose recommendations the government almost
always follows. The military also can legally step into the
political arena when it considers national security to be at risk.
	   As much as the military would like to curb the Islamic parties,
political Islamists would like to restrain the generals role.
	   ``Just like a priest stays away from politics, a soldier cannot
interfere in politics,'' Virtue leader Recai Kutan said after Bir's
speech.
	   Convincing the soldiers of that will not, however, be easy.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with closing bond, late afternoon currency

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks rallied late Friday, pushing the
benchmark average higher for the eighth straight day, after the
prime minister voiced support for tax cuts. The dollar gained
slightly against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 39.66 points, or 0.24
percent, to close at 16,511.24.
	   The benchmark average has now gained almost 10 percent in eight
straight sessions, including a gain Thursday of 108.69 points, or
0.66 percent.
	   The dollar bought 139.24 yen in late trading, up 0.06 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo but well below its late New York rate of
140.95 yen overnight.
	   The Nikkei 225 was down most the day on profit taking but soared
more than 200 points in the last hour of trading after Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said in a campaign speech that he will
favor permanent tax cuts.
	   Economists had called for such moves to boost consumer spending
and lift Japan out of its worst recession since World War II.
	   Hashimoto had resisted because Japan's national debt now totals
almost the entire amount of its gross domestic product _ making it
the largest in the industrial world.
	   ``Personally I hope we will have not temporary tax cuts, but
so-called permanent tax reforms. I think we'll move in that
direction,'' Hashimoto said Friday afternoon.
	   Trading on the first section was a brisk 581 million shares,
well above average about below Thursday's 924 million.
	   Declining issues outnumbered gainers 6-to-5.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section slipped 2.10 points, or 0.17 percent, to 1,268.36. The
TOPIX closed down 0.29 points, or 0.02 percent, the day before.
	   On the currency market, Hashimoto's support for new tax cuts
helped drive the dollar down from earlier gains. The dollar traded
as high as 141.03 yen before falling as low as 138.20 yen in the
afternoon.
	   The dollar had risen most of the day, driven by disappointment
with the government's long-awaited plan for cleaning up Japan's bad
debt-ridden banking system, released Thursday night.
	   The plan contained little that hadn't already been announced or
leaked to the media. Its center piece was a new law allowing
``bridge banks,'' which would take over loans from failed
institutions.
	   But investors had wanted more, including commitments to use
public money to speed up the writeoff of bad debts.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.340 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.305 percent, driving its price down to 110.90 yen from 111.16
yen.

Veteran fighters bid for title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) _ Fortysomethings Joe Bugner and
James ``Bonecrusher'' Smith will fight each other for the vacant
World Boxing Federation heavyweight title Saturday.
	   Bugner, 48, lost his last world title fight on points against
Muhammad Ali almost 23 years ago, while Smith, 45, held the WBA
title before losing it to Mike Tyson in 1987.
	   Although the WBF is a lowly rated organization, Bugner is taking
his bid to become the oldest world heavyweight champion seriously.
	   ``We know the seriousness of this fight is going to happen when
the bell goes,'' Bugner said. ``After all the years we've been in
this business, trust me, we're not going to play tiddlywinks. I'm
going to try and brain him.''
	   The fight's promoters, International Sports Corporation, have
said that an unnamed management group linked to Tyson is trying to
line their man up with the winner later in the year. While that
scenario seems unlikely at best, it is just another carrot waved in
front of Bugner.
	   Bugner has a record of 67-13-1 with 41 knockouts and weighed in
at 118 kilograms (260 pounds). Smith has a 43-15-1 record with 31
knockouts and weighed in at 127 kilograms (280 pounds).
	   ``This one I'm very ready for because I know how dangerous this
man will be in the first two or three rounds, but I want to make
sure I'm more dangerous in about the sixth or seventh round,''
Australian Bugner said. ``He's slow, but I know he can punch so
I'll just have to be faster than him.''
	   United States' Smith's visit Down Under is part of a crusade. If
he wins he intends spending the spoils on preaching ``God's
message.''
	   He said he had trained hard enough to beat Bugner.
	   ``Seeing Joe says I'm slow I'm going to see how fast I can knock
him out,'' said Smith. ``I'm a big guy, a strong guy in tremendous
condition and I'm a puncher so it's going to be interesting to see
if Joe or anybody else in the world can stand up to my power.''

South Korean labor group urges more strikes amid restructuring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATEs with another labor umbrella group joining and other
details in grafs 12-13 &QL; 
 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Threats of labor unrest soared Friday
after the government announced it will privatize 11 state-owned
corporations to increase efficiency and attract solely needed
foreign investment.
	   The militant Korean Confederation of Trade Unions called for a
new wave of strikes to fight increased restructuring and layoffs
and also demanded a freeze on South Korea's annual dlrs 2.8 billion
in arms purchases.
	   Responding to the strike call, workers at Hyundai Motors Co.,
South Korea's largest automaker, said they will walk off the
assembly lines for two days from Monday, as a prelude to a bigger
strike later this month.
	   The government said earlier in the day it will sell off its
26.7-percent stake in Pohang Iron and Steel Co., the world's No. 2
steel maker, beginning this month.
	   It will also phase out its large holdings in three companies _
telephone giant Korea Telecom, the blue-chip Korea Electric Power
Corp. and cigarette monopoly Korea Tobacco and Ginseng Corp. _ by
2002.
	   ``The restructuring will wipe out bubbles and inefficiency,''
said Jin Nyum, head of the government's Planning and Budget
Commission. He said the privatization will draw up to dlrs 8
billion to South Korea by next year.
	   The announcement followed the government-ordered closure earlier
this week of five financially unstable banks. The latest move was
expected to prod more restructuring in other industries, part of
the government's effort to restore the confidence of foreign
investors in South Korea's shattered economy.
	   For years, bloated state-run enterprises have been accused of
corruption and redundant manpower. They often set up numerous
subsidiaries, filling top posts with retiring government officials.
	   Restructuring South Korea's inefficient industries is a key
condition set by the International Monetary Fund, which bailed out
the country's economy late last year.
	   But South Korean workers, accustomed to lifetime employment,
fear that such privatization would lead to large layoffs.
	   ``The government must immediately stop the restructuring that
kills our livelihood,'' said the labor confederation, which claims
a membership of 500,000 in state-run companies, banks, the
automobile and other heavy industries.
	   Auto and other metal workers will go on a nationwide strike on
July 14. On the next day, the confederation will join forces with
the conservative Korean Federation of Trade Unions to spread the
strike to state-run companies and 27 commercial banks.
	   The two rival labor umbrella groups had seldom cooperated
previously. But this time, they said they will bring 200,000
workers to a rally in Seoul July 12 in a joint show of force.
	   Unemployment is rising rapidly in South Korea. Government
figures show that the number of jobless people has doubled to
nearly 1.5 million and will likely top 2 million by the end of the
year.
	   In a separate news conference, the group demanded the government
suspend new weapons purchases until the economic crisis subsides,
despite Defense Ministry insistence the financial crisis should not
hurt military readiness against communist North Korea.

Palestinians lift siege on Jewish settlements after standoff
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu quote; ADDS context graf &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KFAR DAROM, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinians lifted their blockade
of Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip on Friday morning, ending a
12-hour standoff in which Israeli and Palestinian troops had
scuffled, screamed accusations and pointed guns at one another.
	   It was the most serious confrontation between the two sides in
two years, with Israeli troops bringing in armored personnel
carriers and the Palestinians blocking roads with truck convoys.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai asked U.S. Mideast
peace envoy, Dennis Ross, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, for help. After all-night negotiations, a
compromise was reached just before dawn Friday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the Palestinian
Authority of provoking Israel deliberately.
	   ``Yesterday's attempt to use force ... is a very major violation
of the Oslo (peace) agreements,'' Netanyahu told foreign
ambassadors. ``Violence will set the Palestinians back and the
peace process back.''
	   It was not immediately clear whether the standoff would affect
U.S. attempts to broker agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal
from 13 percent of the West Bank. By blockading settlements, the
Palestinians played into fears by Israeli hardliners who claim that
a pullback would leave more than a dozen settlements isolated and
at the mercy of the Palestinian Authority.
	   The Gaza confrontation began with a seemingly routine argument
over the use of a road. About two-thirds of the Gaza Strip is
controlled by the Palestinian Authority, but Israeli troops patrol
near Jewish settlements and control several access roads.

Protesters urge Washington to help clean up former U.S. bases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ More than 100 protesters rallied
Friday at the U.S. Embassy to urge Washington to help the
Philippines clean up toxic waste allegedly left behind by American
troops when they left in 1992.
	   The protest rally came a day ahead of July 4, the U.S.
Independence Day, which is celebrated here as U.S.-Philippine
Friendship Day.
	   ``The U.S. undermines irrefutable evidence of toxic
contamination by refusing to recognize it,'' said the People's Task
Force for Bases Clean-up in a statement. ``We seem to have a
forgetful friend.''
	   About 120 people, coming from villages just outside the former
U.S. Clark Base, came by bus to Manila and marched to the seaside
embassy under heavy police guard.
	   Groups that opposed the bases accused the Americans of not
properly cleaning up before they left.
	   When they were operating, Clark and the Naval facility at nearby
Subic were the biggest U.S. military facilities outside the
continental United States. Both bases have been transformed into
export-processing zones.
	   The American departure ended nearly a century of U.S. military
presence in the Philippines.
	   Nerissa Agustin, a leader of the protesters, said that when
American troops left the Philippines in 1992 after the Philippine
Senate refused to renew their lease on American faciilties, they
left behind a ``toxic legacy'' which continue threaten Filipinos
living near the former bases.
	   ``The Americans should clean up the left inside Subic and
Clark,'' she added.
	   In November, the Philippine government asked the United States
to help in a fuller study of possible toxic waste contamination at
former U.S. bases in the country.
	   Two private companies that conducted initial environmental
studies of the former bases found moderate amounts of soil and
water contamination.

Parliament adopts bill on medical exams for president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In a law aimed at Boris Yeltsin, parliament's
lower house passed a bill Friday that would require the Russian
president to undergo a medical exam if he failed to work full-time
for more than four months.
	   Many of Yeltsin's Communist opponents in parliament claim that a
series of illnesses in recent years has left him physically unfit
to hold office.
	   Also, parliament planned to revive a related bill under which
the Supreme Court would determine whether a president should be
removed from office because of poor health.
	   The Russian constitution says a president must step down if he
suffers a ``lasting inability to exercise his powers.'' But it does
not explain the process for removing a president on these grounds,
and the new bill is intended to fill the gap.
	   To become law, the bills must be approved by both chambers of
parliament and then signed by Yeltsin. Would likely veto the
measures if they reached his desk.
	   Yeltsin and his doctors say the president has fully recovered
from heart bypass surgery in 1996 and is in good condition. But
Communists and other foes disagree. They argue he is unfit for
office and should step down.
	   Yeltsin has made it clear he intends to serve his full term,
which runs until the year 2000. Yeltsin, 67, has said he does not
plan to run for another term, but has not ruled it out completely.
	   Under the bill approved Friday, parliament would be authorized
to ask the Supreme Court to appoint a team of doctors to examine a
president if he failed to work full-time for a period of four
months or more.
	   Communists in parliament are also trying to impeach Yeltsin.
They have made several such attempts in recent years, but all have
collapsed and the latest initiative is also likely to fail.
	   Communists and their allies have accused Yeltsin of several
transgressions, including instigating the collapse of the Soviet
Union, launching the botched war in Chechnya and ruining Russia's
economy.

More than 100 arrested in protest at uranium mine site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ More than 100 protesters were arrested
Friday after overwhelming police and storming onto the site of a
proposed new uranium mine in Australia's north, police said.
	   About 300 protesters walked from a camp set up in March by
anti-uranium groups protesting Energy Resources of Australia Ltd.'s
planned mine on the Jabiluka mineral lease, about 190 miles (300
kms) east of Darwin.
	   About 180 protesters climbed a security fence and walked onto
the construction site, said spokeswoman Megan Kinninment.
	   ``They were reclaiming the lease for the traditional Aboriginal
owners of this land, the Mirrar people, who have been opposed to
this mine from the start,'' she said.
	   Police Superintendent Gary Smith said dozens of protesters
stampeded over police on their way to the site, elbowing officers
out of the way. Police were considering laying assault charges
against the demonstrators.
	   Construction of the Jabiluka mine _ Australia's first new
uranium mine in a decade _ began in June, after a protracted legal
battle with Aboriginal land owners and amid continuing
environmental protest.
	   ERA has identified more than 90,000 (metric) tons of uranium
oxide at Jabiluka, one of the largest untapped high-grade uranium
ore bodies in the world.
	   It expects the mine to add U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion (Australian
dollars 6.2 billion) to Australia's gross domestic product over an
about 30-year mine life, and boost the country's share of the world
uranium market.
	   Almost 100 arrested protesters had been taken to Darwin because
the jail at the nearby town of Jabiru was not big enough, Smith
said.

Bangladesh depreciates taka against dollar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladesh devalued its currency by 1.7
percent to boost exports and encourage Bangladeshi expatriates to
send more foreign currency home, the central bank said Friday.
	   One U.S. dollar will now cost 47.10 takas against its earlier
rate of 46.30 takas, the Bangladesh Bank said. The taka was last
devalued in February, by 1.8 percent.
	   The move met mixed reactions.
	   ``Import of machinery for industries will now cost more. This
will also increase the inflation now estimated at 8 percent,''
A.K.M. Shamsuddin, president of the Foreign Investors Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, said in a telephone interview.
	   But exporters welcome the decision, saying it should boost the
country's garment industry. The devaluation will make clothing and
other Bangladeshi exports cheaper in comparison to the U. S.
dollar.
	   Garment exports earn Bangladesh an annual revenue of more than
dlrs 3 billion, about 60 percent of the national export income.
	   About 2 million Bangladeshis work abroad and send home up to
dlrs 1.4 billion a year.

Sorcery defense denied, boy murderers sent to jail

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Two Papua New Guinea boys
who hacked a woman to death with an axe because they believed she
killed their sister through sorcery were sentenced Friday to 15
years of hard labor.
	   Markus Patale Gae, 12, and Pius Lakoi Totovi, 14, had pleaded
guilty to murdering Bogolol Loima while she was asleep.
	   The killing took place on Dec. 29 at Tetuke village, on the
southern coast of East New Britain Province.
	   In handing down his sentence, National Court Justice Moses
Jalina said the killing was a senseless and brutal attack on an old
woman who could not defend herself.
	   Jalina said that there was no evidence she had used sorcery,
despite the brothers' claim that Loima had killed their younger
sister. He said they were not excused under tribal law.

tour today by challenging its leaders to set the pace for rescuing
Asia from the region's financial crisis.
	   The president, who met with pro-democracy leader Martin Lee and
others, also declared that the future prosperity of Hong Kong,
China and all nations will depend on promoting political freedoms
to spur economic success.
	   ``Societies with the free flow of ideas are most likely to be
both successful and stable in the new century,'' Clinton told
business and community leaders in this city of high rises and high
expectations.
	   ``I look forward to the day when all of the people of Hong Kong
realize the rights and responsibilities of full democracy,''
Clinton said.
	   The president, who during his nine-day China tour repeatedly
touted the idea that human rights and economic progress go hand in
hand, said countries will be left behind if they constrain their
citizens.
	   ``I think the forces of history will move all visionary people,
including Asians with their legendary assets of hard work,
intelligence, and education, toward freer, more democratic
societies,'' Clinton said.
	   He expressed confidence that Hong Kong, while grappling with its
own economic woes amid Asia's currency crisis, ``can help Asia out
of turbulent times as it contributes to China's astonishing
transformation.''
	   ``I am confident Hong Kong will get through this,'' Clinton
said, speaking from a gull-shaped convention center, the site of
the July 1, 1997 ceremony where the Union Jack was lowered and
China's red flag was raised to resume mainland control after 156
years of British rule.
	   Clinton praised China for not devaluing its currency _ a move
that could worsen its neighbors' economic woes _ and Japan for
announcing a plan to revive its moribund economy by granting the
government power to take over failed banks and spend more than dlrs
200 billion to protect depositors and businesses.
	   Taking aim at the roots of Asia's economic problems, he
cautioned against the creation of prosperity on the ``shaky
foundations of cronyism, corruption and overextended credit.''
	   In a show of support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy politicians
and reformers, the president met with de facto opposition leader
Lee and several others among the 20 legislators who won recent
legislative elections.
	   Lee expressed gratitude to Clinton and later told reporters that
the president's trip was a ``very good opening for dialogue.''
	   ``We hope to see concrete results of Mr. Clinton's visit _ a
faster pace of reform in terms of human rights, the rule of law and
democracy,'' Lee said.
	   The president had dinner Thursday with Tung Chee-hwa, Hong
Kong's Beijing-appointed chief executive, who assured Clinton that
the port city would keep its thriving autonomy.
	   Political freedom was a major theme of Clinton's trip, the first
China visit by an American president since the 1989 Tiananmen
Square crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators disrupted
U.S.-China relations.
	   Clinton has said that differences over human rights cannot stop
the United States and China from working together to solve shared
problems, from a nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan to
tensions on the Korean Peninsula to the Asian financial crisis.

Leading Philippine banker criticizes tax amnesty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A leading banker urged new Philippine
President Joseph Estrada on Friday to reject a proposed tax amnesty
and concentrate instead on recovering the alleged ill-gotten wealth
of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
	   Estrada, who took office Tuesday, has said he is considering a
compromise with delinquent taxpayers to help reverse the
government's budget deficit.
	   Estrada said the government would collect about 50 percent of
the tax due from delinquent companies and individuals who apply for
the amnesty.
	   ``We cannot have a tax amnesty too often,'' said Deogracias
Vistan, president of the Bankers Association of the Philippines.
``If (the government) is too generous, it takes away the incentive
for taxpayers to pay on time.''
	   Estrada, however, dismissed the concern as premature, saying the
program has not yet been put together.
	   Vistan said the government should focus instead on recovering
the more than dlrs 500 million in Marcos' Swiss bank accounts,
which he said is enough to ``wipe out a good part of our deficit.''
	   The government's budget deficit as of April was about 15.4
billion pesos (dlrs 375 million).
	   The Marcos deposits have been transferred to an escrow account
at a Philippine bank pending settlement of a dispute over their
ownership.
	   The Marcos family claims the money is theirs but the government
says it is part of the billions of dollars Marcos allegedly stole
during his 20-year rule.
	   The money is also being claimed by 9,539 Filipinos who won a
class action suit against the Marcos estate for human rights abuses
under his rule.

Share prices close sharply lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices tumbled in Hong Kong Friday as
investors took profits because of disappointment over Japan's
latest plan to revive its financial sector.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 226.85 points, or 2.6 percent, to close at 8,639.31. on
Thursday, the index had surged 323.06 points, or 3.8 percent.
	   Turnover amounted to 4.51 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
578 million), down from 7.98 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1.02 billion).
	   Brokers said share prices opened sharply lower because investors
considered Japan's ``bridge banks'' plan to clean up the banking
system as insufficient.
	   Bridge banks would make it easier for the Japanese government to
allow ailing banks to go bankrupt while preventing a collapse of
confidence in the already-shaky financial system.
	   ``The market had built in high expectation the day before.
That's why the market rallied yesterday ,'''' said George Chan,
research analyst at Cheerful Securities Ltd.
	   Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 1.80 Hong Kong
dollars to 33.70, and Cheung Kong fell 1.00 dollar to 39.00.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 4.00 dollars to
190.50, and Hang Seng Bank fell 80 cents to 45.10.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa fell 1.40 dollars to 41.70, and
Swire Pacific ``A' fell 40 cents to 29.60.

Thai Chrysler faces lawsuit over loan default
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Two banks have sued a Thai company in
which U.S. automaker Chrysler holds a 30 percent interest, charging
the firm defaulted on a dlrs 40 million loan, a spokesman for the
creditors said Friday.
	   Deutsche Bank and Industrial Bank of Japan in late May filed
suit against Thai Chrysler Automotive Ltd to recover dlrs 8
million, said the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   He said they won a injunction barring the company from exporting
271 Jeep Grand Cherokee autos worth dlrs 6.7 million.
	   Eight other banks which joined in the dlrs 40 million syndicated
loan are also expected to sue, he said.
	   A spokesman for Thai Chrysler Automotive said the partners in
the firm were meeting Friday with representatives of the creditors,
but no agreements had yet been announced.
	   The suit came after the two investors in the automotive joint
venture _ which imports, assembles and distributes Chrysler autos
and parts in Thailand _ apparently became estranged, according to
reports in Thai newspapers.
	   The company was established in 1994 with a publicly-listed Thai
company, Swedish Motors, holding a 70 percent share, and Chrysler
holding 30 percent.
	   According to the Bangkok Post, Chrysler several months ago
sought to buy the Swedish Motors stake in the joint venture, but
even though a memorandum of understanding was signed, the deal fell
through because the two sides could not agree on price.
	   After failing to buy out their partner, Chrysler established a
wholly-owned subsidiary named Chrysler Sales and Service to handle
sales, distribution and service of Chrysler products in Thailand,
said the report.
	   The spokesman for Thai Chrysler Automotive said operations were
continuing as normal at Chrysler's productio line at the Swedish
Motors plant in a Bangkok suburb.
	   Executives from Swedish Motors declined comment on the lawsuit.
Swedish Motors Corp. is the distributor of European luxury sedan
Volvo.

Algeria to accept international observers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ In a change of heart, Algeria's
government is now ready to welcome observers from the United
Nations, the Arab League and the Organization of Arab Unity, state
radio said Friday.
	   For nearly a year, the government has rejected such requests as
an attack on its sovereignty.
	   The six observers are to come in the next few weeks, the radio
said. It quoted Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf as saying the
observers' mandate would be ``not investigatory, not
fact-finding.'' He didn't say what it would involve.
	   European delegations did visit earlier in the year, but
observers from the groups mentioned Friday haven't been allowed in.
	   Algeria continues to be ravaged by a 6-year-old Muslim
insurgency that has left more than 75,000 people dead, many in
massacres and bombings.
	   On Sunday, a new law goes into effect mandating the official use
of Arabic. It is seen as an effort by the military-backed
government to appease supporters of Islamic movements.

Bank approves dlrs 1 billion loan, more may be on the way
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with more information; ADDS byline; NEW to
some points &QL; 
 &UR; By HARRY DUNPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The World Bank has approved a dlrs 1 billion
loan for Indonesia that was put on hold after rioting and political
upheaval forced President Suharto to resign, and a bank official
predicted a dlrs 6 billion package from the IMF would soon follow.
	   Dennis de Tray, the bank's country director for Indonesia, said
Thursday that dlrs 600 million of the dlrs 1 billion loan already
had been disbursed after the executive board approved it. He said
he saw no difficulty in Indonesia President B.J. Habibie's
government fulfilling the conditions to receive the remaining dlrs
400 million, probably in September.
	   Habibie came to power on May 21, after Suharto, who led the
Southeast Asian country for more than three decades, stepped down
amid widespread riots and violent protests over his autocratic
rule.
	   The dlrs 1 billion loan was part of a World Bank pledge of dlrs
4.5 billion to Indonesia over three years to help the world's
fourth most populous nation cope with its worst financial crisis in
30 years. On June 2, the bank approved a dlrs 225 million rural
poverty reduction loan for Indonesia.
	   The dlrs 1 billion loan comes while Indonesia is beset with
uncertainty and worry about social chaos. Some residents in
Jakarta, the capital, fear spreading poverty will trigger more
violence such as the riots over price increases that killed as many
as 1,200 people and drove Suharto from office.
	   The bank said the loan will help reform the banking and
financial system while the government works to overcome the
financial crisis, restore economic growth and protect the poor by
financing imports of such staples as rice and soybeans.
	   ``We see this loan as a critical component in the overall
package of assistance provided by the international community,''
World Bank President James Wolfensohn said. ``Its objective is to
rebuild confidence and help Indonesia make a new start.''
	   De Tray said the bank's action followed recent decisions by the
Asian Development Bank and the Japanese Export-Import Bank to
provide Indonesia with financial help.
	   Asia's financial crisis has hit Indonesia the hardest of all.
The value of its currency, the rupiah, has dropped more than 80
percent in the past 11 months. Inflation and unemployment are
soaring as hundreds of companies find themselves unable to cope
with huge debt. The economy is expected to shrink by 10 percent
this year.
	   ``The budget needs of Indonesia are extremely substantial at
this time. Revenues have collapsed and subsidies bills are growing
extremely rapidly. Subsidy growth, we all accept, is necessary to
keep the lid on,'' de Tray said. He was referring to the need to
provide basic food products and fuel at low government-supported
prices in order to prevent civil unrest.
	   ``We and the IMF are looking for around dlrs 6 billion of
additional financing to complete the package,'' de Tray said.
``Discussions are under way and they are at a critical stage.
	   The IMF and Indonesia announced agreement June 25 on a revised
rescue program that put a dlrs 43 billion bailout package back on
track, the fourth time the program has been revised since last
October.

Angry Russian miners again block Trans-Siberian railway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Upset over back wages that are months overdue,
Russian coal miners on Friday blocked the Trans-Siberian railway
for the second time in two months, news reports said.
	   Miners, state employees, and members of the regional legislature
blocked the rails in Anzhero-Sudzhensk in central Siberia, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. The protesters held up all freight
trains but allowed passenger trains through.
	   The miners say the federal government has paid only two-thirds
of a 1 billion ruble (dlrs 160 million) sum that was promised after
miners blocked the rails for two weeks in May.
	   Regional Gov. Aman Tuleyev said in a statement released Friday
that the federal government had not paid off the money it promised
in May. He sympathized with the miners, but opposed blocking the
rails.
	   However, Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said the government
has paid all the back wages it owes, a figure he put at 200 million
rubles (dlrs 32.8 million). He said coal companies owe miners a
much larger sum _ 8.6 billion rubles (dlrs 1.4 billion).
	   Protesters also gathered near rails in other around the region,
but were not blocking trains, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Thousands of Russian coal miners staged scattered strikes in
May, complaining that they hadn't been paid for months. The
protests disrupted rail traffic, but the miners agreed to return to
their jobs after being promised they would receive some of their
overdue wages.
	   Millions of workers throughout Russia receive their wages months
late, part of a cycle of non-payments that has plagued the
struggling economy for years.

Chief of staff undercuts Netanyahu's security claims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Undercutting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Israel's outgoing military chief suggested Friday that a troop
pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank, as proposed by the
United States, would not endanger Israel's security.
	   Netanyahu has resisted the U.S. plan for months, saying a
withdrawal from 13 percent of the land would harm Israel's security
interests and that Israel could hand over no more than 9 percent.
	   However, in recent days there has been a noticable shift in
Netanyahu's argument, with the prime minister now saying the
Palestinians refusal to carry out their security obligations was
holding up agreement.
	   Lt. Gen. Amnon Shahak, who completes his term next week, said
the relationship between the size of withdrawal and the security of
Israel was not as clearcut as Netanyahu was making it out to be.
	   ``The way I see it, the difference between 11 and 13 percent, or
nine and 13 percent _ it's not that it is trivial, not that it is
unimportant _ but it is certainly not very very dramatic,'' Shahak
said in a farewell interview on Israel army radio.
	   ``The main thing is not only the size of the land given back,
but under what conditions and in what atmosphere ...,'' Shahak
said.
	   Shahak was a key player in the negotiations with the
Palestinians on the 1995 autonomy agreement, and Israeli media have
speculated that he will join the opposition Labor Party after
leaving the army.
	   Shahak and Netanyahu have had an often turbulent relationship,
and reportedly have not met privately for months. Last month,
Netanyahu cut short a Shahak briefing to the Cabinet about the
peace process, saying the army chief was touching upon issues that
were none of his concern.
	   The two also came into conflict over Netanyahu's claim that the
army backed his September 1996 decision to open a new entrance to a
tourist tunnel near Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem's Old City. The
opening led to riots that killed 80 people.,
	   Shahak, who has been chief of staff since January 1995, will
complete his term on Thursday.

uncertainty and worry about social chaos. Some residents in
Jakarta, the capital, fear spreading poverty will trigger more
violence such as the riots over price increases that killed as many
as 1,200 people and drove Suharto from office.
	   The bank said the loan will help reform the banking and
financial system while the government works to overcome the
financial crisis, restore economic growth and protect the poor by
financing imports of such staples as rice and soybeans.
	   ``We see this loan as a critical component in the overall
package of assistance provided by the international community,''
World Bank President James Wolfensohn said. ``Its objective is to
rebuild confidence and help Indonesia make a new start.''
	   De Tray said the bank's action followed recent decisions by the
Asian Development Bank and the Japanese Export-Import Bank to
provide Indonesia with financial help.
	   Asia's financial crisis has hit Indonesia the hardest of all.
The value of its currency, the rupiah, has dropped more than 80
percent in the past 11 months. Inflation and unemployment are
soaring as hundreds of companies find themselves unable to cope
with huge debt. The economy is expected to shrink by 10 percent
this year.
	   ``The budget needs of Indonesia are extremely substantial at
this time. Revenues have collapsed and subsidies bills are growing
extremely rapidly. Subsidy growth, we all accept, is necessary to
keep the lid on,'' de Tray said. He was referring to the need to
provide basic food products and fuel at low government-supported
prices in order to prevent civil unrest.''
	   The IMF and Indonesia announced agreement June 25 on a revised
rescue program that put a dlrs 43 billion bailout package back on
track, the fourth time the program has been revised since last
October.

Court sentences soldiers to death for rape, murder of Tamil girl

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Five soldiers and a police officer
were convicted of rape and murder and sentenced to death Friday in
an attack on a young Tamil woman and her family.
	   The case had been closely followed in Sri Lanka as a test of the
government's commitment to protecting minorities and punishing
attacks on them. Death sentences are usually commuted to life in
prison, but President Chandrika Kumaratunga may hesitate to do so
in this explosive case.
	   The security officers raped and strangled Krishanthi
Kumaraswamy, 18, a student they stopped at a military checkpoint
near the Jaffna Peninsula village of Chemmanihi in September 1996.
	   Her mother, 16-year-old brother and a neighbor were also killed
when they went to the checkpoint looking for her.
	   The military at first denied any knowledge of the incident. But
shortly after the four bodies were found buried in an old salt mine
near the checkpoint, nine members of the security forces were
arrested.
	   One of the security men died in prison, another escaped and
charges against a third were dropped.
	   In the past, Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sril Lanka's
population, have cited abuse and arrogance by government soldiers
as one of the causes of Tamil discontent. Militant Tamils are
fighting a war against the Sri Lankan military for an independent
Tamil homeland.
	   Rebels say they are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese who control the government and the military. More than
54,000 people have been died in the war that started in 1983.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moody's Investors Service said Friday it has placed
on review for possible downgrade its triple-A long-term debt
ratings of Toyota Motor Corp. and its subsidiaries.
	   Moody's said its action is based on the increasingly competitive
environment in which the company operates and on the weakening of
automobile demand both in Japan and in export markets throughout
Southeast Asia.
	   This review does not impact Toyota's or its subsidiaries'
short-term ratings, which remain Prime-1, Moody's said.
	   The ratings under review affect about 400 billion yen (dlrs 2.9
billion) of Toyota's outstanding debts.
	   Moody's said its review will focus on the implications of the
slowdown in auto sales in Japan as well as export markets,
particularly Southeast Asia and Europe and the outlook for
improvement in the near and intermediate term.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The injection of government money
into stalled development projects may prevent layoffs of workers in
the hard-hit construction sector, a Malaysian official said Friday.
	   Public Works Minister Samy Vellu said the new funds would be
used to restart a coastal highway project, abandoned road schemes
in Kuala Lumpur and a 500 million ringgit (dlrs 125 million)
national sewerage system, the domestic news agency, Bernama,
reported.
	   ``The contract for the east coast highway can be signed in the
next two or three weeks to allow work to begin as soon as
possible,'' he told reporters in the northern state of Perlis.
``The construction industry is slow now as a result of the economic
downturn.''
	   An average of 1,600 people were being laid off each week,
according to government statistics quoted by Friday's Business
Times daily.
	   Of those sacked, 42.8 percent were from the manufacturing
industry, 32 percent from construction and the remaining from other
trades.
	   Since January, 39,155 people have lost their jobs. Of them, 89
percent or 34,843, were Malaysian, the daily said. Malaysia employs
numerous foreign workers.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim Wednesday announced a 5
billion ringgit (dlrs 1.25 billion) stimulus package to revive many
huge projects abandoned after last year's economic shock.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Andress Soriano III has resigned as
chairman of San Miguel Corp., the Philippines' largest food and
beverage conglomerate, the company announced Friday.
	   San Miguel said Soriano resigned on Thursday to ``give way to a
new management'' after 12 years at the helm of the company.
	   Soriano became chairman of San Miguel in 1986 when former
President Corazon Aquino took power and seized San Miguel shares
alleged to be part of the ill-gotten wealth of her cousin, business
tycoon Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.
	   Cojuangco, who headed the company before Soriano took over, is
challenging the seizure of the shares.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Finance Ministry plans to
sell all of its 12.5 percent stake in Esso (Thailand) PCL, a unit
of the U.S.-based Exxon Corp., to raise fund for the cash-strapped
government, a Cabinet minister said.
	   The ministry, which bought the stake in 1994, wants to sell it
back to the parent company, Savit Bhodivihok, who is in charge of
energy affairs, said late Thursday night.
	   Esso (Thailand) was a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon until the
Finance Ministry bought the stake. But in the past year, the
once-booming Thai economy has foundered in the Asian financial
crisis and the government is short of cash.
	   Savit said he expected the Finance Ministry to settle the
purchase terms with Exxon in September. He did not say how much the
Finance Ministry had paid for the stake.
	   The economic crisis has deeply cut the Thai government's tax
revenue and the government is expected to generate a budget deficit
equal to 3 percent of gross domestic product this year.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Two banks have sued a Thai company in
which U.S. automaker Chrysler holds a 30 percent interest, charging
the firm defaulted on a dlrs 40 million loan, a spokesman for the
creditors said Friday.
	   Deutsche Bank and Industrial Bank of Japan in late May filed
suit against Thai Chrysler Automotive Ltd to recover dlrs 8
million, said the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   He said they won a injunction barring the company from exporting
271 Jeep Grand Cherokee autos worth dlrs 6.7 million.
	   Eight other banks which joined in the dlrs 40 million syndicated
loan are also expected to sue, he said.
	   A spokesman for Thai Chrysler Automotive said the partners in
the firm were meeting Friday with representatives of the creditors,
but no agreements had yet been announced.
	   The suit came after the two investors in the automotive joint
venture _ which imports, assembles and distributes Chrysler autos
and parts in Thailand _ apparently became estranged, according to
reports in Thai newspapers.
	   The company was established in 1994 with a publicly-listed Thai
company, Swedish Motors, holding a 70 percent share, and Chrysler
holding 30 percent.

Milosevic denies attacks on Kosovo civilians; new U.S. talks set
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with Milosevic comments, bomb exploding in
Pristina, Yugoslav fighter jet flyovers, report of Kijevo fighting
and of Serbs' recapturing the village; trims. Holbrooke arrives in
Belgrade sometime after 1000 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ahead of new talks Friday with U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke, President Slobodan Milosevic denied that
Yugoslav and Serb forces are involved in repressive actions against
civilians in Kosovo.
	   Milosevic, who has rejected international demands that he cease
his military campaign in the secessionist Serbian province and
withdraw his forces there, reiterated that negotiations should
begin immediately with ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   ``There can be no other path to solving the crisis'' in Kosovo,
media in the Yugoslavian capital, Belgrade, quoted him as saying at
a meeting with two top aides Thursday.
	   Hours before Holbrooke was scheduled to fly to Belgrade to meet
with Milosevic, a remote-controlled bomb exploded early Friday in a
Serb residential area of Kosovo's capital Pristina, damaging
several cars.
	   No injuries were reported in the explosion, but the blast
underscored high tensions and the difficulties Holbrooke faces in
trying to arrange a cease-fire between Serb forces and Kosovo
militants.
	   A police officer at the scene who refused to give his name
blamed the Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Friday's scheduled meeting with Milosevic in Belgrade is part of
intense diplomatic efforts to end the violence in Kosovo, where
hundreds of people have died in recent months.
	   Despite the Serb crackdown, which has driven tens of thousands
of ethnic Albanians from their villages, the independent FoNet news
agency quoted Milosevic as saying: ``There are not, nor will there
be any repressive actions against the civilian population in
Kosovo.''
	   Milosevic says the crackdown is aimed at Albanian terrorists who
have targeted Serb police and civilians in their militant campaign
for independence. Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the
population of Kosovo, which Serbs consider their historic
heartland.
	   Albanians have said they want a cease-fire and Serb pullback
before they resume negotiations, but the KLA's position is not
clear. U.S. officials have been pressuring them to adhere to any
cease-fire agreement.
	   Yugoslav fighter jets on Friday repeatedly flew low over
Pristina, repeating a tactic of the past few days that ethnic
Albanians say is an attempt to intimidate them.
	   There were reports of renewed clashes Friday in the crossroads
village of Kijevo about 25 kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina.
Serb forces have been fighting to break the siege of KLA fighters
who surrounded and cut off the Serb village in mid-June. This week,
Holbrooke called Kijevo ``the most dangerous place in Europe.''
	   The pro-government Serb Media Center said Serb police had taken
control of Kijevo Friday morning. The report could not immediately
be confirmed.
	   NATO officials have said they reserve the option of using
military force to halt the violence if all else fails. But the
alliance's top leader insisted Thursday that he prefers a
diplomatic solution, warning that the mistakes of earlier Balkan
conflicts must be avoided in the strife-torn province.
	   Secretary-General Javier Solana's support for peacemaking
efforts came just hours after the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade
announced that a new diplomatic monitoring mission will start
Monday. The mission will include American, Russian, Austrian and
Polish diplomats.
	   The diplomats will observe freedom of movement, which has been
hampered both by Serb police blocking access to regions where
anti-guerrilla operations are taking place, and Kosovo Albanian
fighters extending their grip in the central part of the province.

Violence terrorizes central Karachi
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Despite thousands of patrolling police
and paramilitary soldiers, seven people _ including four men whose
bodies showed signs of torture _ were killed Friday in ethnic
violence wracking Pakistan's largest city.
	   Soldiers and police in armored personnel carriers and jeeps
mounted with machine guns made rounds in Karachi's troubled central
and eastern neighborhoods. Two police officers and two army Rangers
were among the 11 people who died in fighting in Karachi on
Thursday.
	   More than 200 people have been killed since June 1 in street
violence between three rival factions of the Mohajir Qami Movement,
which represents Indian Muslims who settled in Pakistan in 1947.
Many of the dead were caught in the crossfire, police said.
	   The worst hit neighborhood has been in the Liaqatabad area,
where gunmen have fired relentlessly at each other from rooftops.
	   Five of Friday's victims died in Liaqatabad. Four had been
tortured, their faces bruised and battered, said police officials
who found their bodies.
	   The fifth person was shot by a rooftop sniper, while Friday's
other two victims were killed in the eastern Korangi neighborhood.
	   The federal government threatens to give Rangers sweeping powers
of arrest and detention if the violence continues unabated. The
provincial government of Sindh, of which Karachi is the capital,
has deployed an additional 3,000 men to patrol the streets.
	   Violence has continued despite the increased security.

Palestinians lift siege on Jewish settlements after standoff

<TEXT>
	   KFAR DAROM, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinians lifted their blockade
of Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip on Friday morning, ending a
12-hour standoff in which Israeli and Palestinian troops had
scuffled, screamed accusations and pointed guns at one another.
	   It was the most serious confrontation between the two sides in
two years, with Israeli troops bringing in armored personnel
carriers and the Palestinians blocking roads with truck convoys.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai asked U.S. Mideast
peace envoy, Dennis Ross, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, for help. After all-night negotiations, a
compromise was reached just before dawn Friday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the Palestinian
Authority of provoking Israel deliberately.
	   ``Yesterday's attempt to use force ... is a very major violation
of the Oslo (peace) agreements,'' Netanyahu told foreign
ambassadors. ``Violence will set the Palestinians back and the
peace process back.''
	   It was not immediately clear whether the standoff would affect
U.S. attempts to broker agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal
from 13 percent of the West Bank, which Israel captured from Jordan
in the 1967 Mideast war. By blockading settlements, the
Palestinians played into fears by Israeli hardliners who claim that
a pullback would leave more than a dozen settlements isolated and
at the mercy of the Palestinian Authority.
	   The Gaza confrontation began with a seemingly routine argument
over the use of a road. About two-thirds of the Gaza Strip is
controlled by the Palestinian Authority, but Israeli troops patrol
near Jewish settlements and control several access roads.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ President Bill Clinton wrapped up his nine-day
tour of China Friday, challenging Beijing to set the pace for
rescuing Asia from the region's financial crisis and praising China
for a ``remarkable transformation.''
	   ``Clearly, China is changing. But there remain powerful forces
resisting change,'' he said at a final news conference, mentioning
restrictions on free speech, assembly and worship.
	   The president spoke at a news conference after meeting with
pro-democracy leader Martin Lee and separately with other Hong Kong
legislators. After the session he was returning to the United
States for the Independence Day holiday.
	   ``I don't think anyone who was on this trip could fail to
appreciate the remarkable transformation that is under way in
China, as well as the distance to be travelled,'' Clinton said,
speaking in the ballroom of a Hong Kong hotel used as a filing
center for reporters.

	   ``Over the past week we have seen the glory of China's past in
Xian,'' where his five-city tour began, Clinton said in an opening
statement. ``... I don't think anyone who was on this trip could
fail to appreciate the remarkable transformation that is underway
in China, as well as the distance to be traveled.
	   ``... we end the trip in a place where I hope China' future
begins,'' he said of Hong Kong.
	   Earlier, Clinton told Hong Kong business and community leaders,
``I look forward to the day when all of the people of Hong Kong
realize the rights and responsibilities of full democracy.''
	   The president, who during his China tour repeatedly asserted
that human rights and economic progress go hand in hand, said
countries will be left behind if they constrain their citizens.
	   He said he hopes that Hong Kong, while grappling with its own
economic woes amid Asia's currency crisis, ``can help Asia out of
turbulent times as it contributes to China's astonishing
transformation.''
	   ``I am confident Hong Kong will get through this,'' Clinton
said, speaking from a gull-shaped convention center, the site of
the July 1, 1997 ceremony where the Union Jack was lowered and
China's red flag was raised to resume mainland control after 156
years of British rule.
	   Clinton praised China for not devaluing its currency _ a move
that could worsen its neighbors' economies _ and Japan for
announcing a plan to grant the government power to take over failed
banks and spend more than $200 billion to protect depositors and
businesses.
	   Taking aim at the roots of Asia's economic problems, he
cautioned against the creation of prosperity on the ``shaky
foundations of cronyism, corruption and overextended credit.''
	   In a show of support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy politicians
and reformers, the president met with de facto opposition leader
Martin Lee and several others among the 20 legislators who won
recent legislative elections.
	   Lee expressed gratitude to Clinton for coming to China and
speaking directly about human rights and democracy, particularly in
Hong Kong. He later told reporters that the president's trip was a
``very good opening for dialogue.''
	   ``We hope to see concrete results of Mr. Clinton's visit _ a
faster pace of reform in terms of human rights, the rule of law and
democracy,'' Lee said.
	   Lee said the first year of the transition _ which some feared
would reduce civil and economic freedoms _ had gone well, but that,
like Clinton, he believes the pace of democratic reforms should be
accelerated. His remarks during the private meeting with Clinton
were relayed by Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser.
	   The president had dinner Thursday with Tung Chee-hwa, Hong
Kong's Beijing-appointed chief executive, who assured Clinton that
the port city would keep its thriving autonomy.
	   Political freedom was a major theme of Clinton's trip, the first
China visit by an American president since the 1989 Tiananmen
Square crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators disrupted
U.S.-China relations.
	   ``Our future is tied to Asia's,'' Clinton declared.
	   Clinton praised Chinese President Jiang Zemin for letting him
make his case directly to the nation's 1.2 billion people. And he
said increasingly open societies in Asia _ from South Korea to the
Philippines, Japan to Mongolia _ have created perhaps ``the
greatest moment of actual possibility in human history.''
	   ``All across the region we see evidence that the values of
freedom and democracy are also burning in the hearts of the people
in the East as well as the West,'' said Clinton.
	   The president counseled Asian nations like China not to fear
change or that open societies will lead to social unrest and
trouble.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces reportedly
recaptured a key crossroads village in Kosovo on Friday, breaking a
more than two-week-long siege by ethnic Albanian militants.
	   The retaking of Kijevo, which U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke this
week called ``the most dangerous place in Europe,'' was reported by
Serb sources and the independent Beta news agency in the Yugoslav
capital Belgrade. It could not immediately be confirmed.
	   Serb police said ethnic Albanian fighters suffered casualties.
They did not elaborate.
	   Journalists who tried to reach the blocked-off area late
Thursday encountered no audible combat but found access barred by
tense guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army. Roads to the area
25 kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina were blocked Friday.
	   The reported retaking of Kijevo came hours before U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke was due in Belgrade for new talks with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Earlier reports by Serb media suggested that retaking the
Serb-populated village was the remaining goal of the latest
crackdown by Milosevic's forces in the secessionist province. The
other was the recapture of the strategic Belacevac mine region,
which they accomplished Tuesday after two days of nearly non-stop
fighting.
	   Underscoring the high tensions throughout Kosovo, a
remote-controlled bomb exploded early Friday in a Serb residential
area of the capital Pristina. No injuries but several cars were
damaged, which Serb police blamed on the KLA.
	   Also, Yugoslav fighter jets continued their recent tactic of
flying low over the city. Ethnic Albanians say the buzzing is aimed
at intimidating them.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A retired general who swiftly became a leading
opposition figure in parliament has been shot dead at his country
residence, officials said Friday.
	   Lev Rokhlin, who gained notoriety as a staunch critic of
President Boris Yeltsin, was found in his bed with a gunshot wound
to the head Friday morning at his dacha near Naro-Fominsk, 60
kilometers (40 miles) southwest of Moscow.
	   Rokhlin's wife Tamara confessed to the killing, Interior
Ministry spokesman Yevgeny Ryabtsev was quoted as saying by the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The shooting took place following a Thursday night party to
celebrate the birthday of the couple's son, Russian news agencies
reported, citing police and security officials.
	   Rokhlin, 51, was a general who commanded Russian troops at the
beginning of the 1994-96 war in Chechnya. He was one of the few
Russian military figures to win high praise for his performance in
the conflict, which resulted in an embarrassing defeat for the
Russian forces.
	   After leaving the military, he won election to parliament in
1995 as a member of a faction that supported President Boris
Yeltsin.
	   But Rokhlin grew disenchanted with Yeltsin's plans for military
reform, and he broke with the president, becoming a fierce critic.
	   Last year, Rokhlin launched the Movement in Support of the Army,
an anti-government organization that sought to ``dump the hated
regime'' of Yeltsin.
	   Rokhlin drew support among current and former Russian servicemen
who were upset by the military's decline in recent years. However,
extent of Rokhlin's following remained unclear.
	   Rokhlin is the fifth member of parliament to be killed since
1994.

Police arrest suspected steroids dealer on Polish-German border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) _ A suspected German steroids dealer was
arrested on the Polish border with 25 kilograms (55 pounds) of
anabolic steroids believed imported from Thailand, police said
Friday.
	   The 32-year-old man, whose name was not released, was taken into
custody last Sunday at the Bad Muskau border crossing, pending
charges of breaking Germany's pharmaceutical laws. State police in
eastern Saxony state typically announce such arrests several days
afterward.
	   Police seized tablets and syringes of anabolic steroids worth an
estimated 250,000 marks (dlrs 140,000) on Germany's black market.
	   Police suspect the man regularly imported the drugs by mail from
Thailand to his parents' residence in Poland, and then brought them
to his Hamburg home to sell them illegally to bodybuilders in
Germany and Scandinavia.

Philippine stocks end mixed; peso slips
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing marginally higher

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks battled with
profit-taking for most of the session Friday to end generally
lower, but advancing blue chips still helped the market's main
index eke out a slight gain, traders said.
	   Losers beat gainers 48 to 40, with 38 issues unchanged.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index inched up 3.05
points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,859.24 after Thursday's 74.23-point
surge.
	   In the last five trading days, the main index has gained 150.21
points, or 8.8 percent. Philippine financial markets were closed
Tuesday for President Joseph Estrada's inauguration.
	   The broader All Shares Index rose 1.72 points to 577.32 after an
18.03-point rise Thursday.
	   ``This rally still has quite a way to go. We see resistance
around 1,900 points,'' said Russel Ong, analyst for Anscor Hagedorn
Securities Inc.
	   But whether the gains can be sustained depends largely on how
Japan will act to rev up its slumping economy, he said. The yen has
led the way for other regional currencies in recent weeks.
	   ``We're looking closely at Japan,'' Ong said.
	   Hansley See, analyst for Abacus Securities Corp., said aside
from regional concerns, prospects of higher inflation and domestic
interest rates will also undercut stocks' current strength.
	   ``Higher inflation will make it difficult to bring down interest
rates,'' making fixed income instruments more attractive than
stocks, he said.
	   Just Monday, treasury bill rates jumped on reports that the
government's deficit is widening. Higher inflation could abet the
rise in T-bill yields.
	   In currency trading, the peso ended marginally higher against
the dollar as the market awaited new developments in regional
currency markets, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 41.306 pesos, little changed from Thursday's
average of 41.310 pesos. It was last traded at 41.330 pesos.
	   Traders said the peso is likely to continue to follow the
direction of the Japanese yen for some time.
	   Southeast Asian currencies were trading at a narrow range
against the dollar Friday, also taking their cue from the yen's
movements.

PRISTINA: intimidating them.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Sitting astride the main east-west road in the southern Yugoslav
province, Kijevo has been a flashpoint since the KLA surrounded it
in mid-June and cut off its Serb inhabitants and police. Serb
police had then surrounded the KLA fighters.
	   Holbrooke, who tried to get the KLA to break the siege last
month, has said he feared Milosevic would use massive force to
retake it, possibly resulting in tragedy.
	   Serb police sources said they had suffered no casualties in
Friday's action, which they wrapped up about 7:30 a.m., but the
ethnic Albanians had. No other information was immediately
available.
	   The Beta news agency quoted a Serbian police source as saying
police entered Kijevo Friday morning to find some 100 Serb
civilians and about 50 policemen who had been cut off by the siege.
	   ``There is an ongoing action to search and clear the area around
Kijevo,'' the unidentified police source was quoted as saying,
confirming some fighting still continuing. The source said the
action had been done ``professionally.''
	   Ahead of talks with Holbrooke, Milosevic denied Thursday that
Yugoslav and Serb forces are involved in repressive actions against
civilians in Kosovo.
	   Despite the crackdown that has driven tens of thousands of
ethnic Albanians from their villages, the independent FoNet news
agency quoted him as saying: ``There are not, nor will there be any
repressive actions against the civilian population in Kosovo.''
	   Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo in recent months, since
Serb forces stepped up efforts to crush militant resistance in late
February. Milosevic says the crackdown is aimed at Albanian
terrorists who have targeted Serb police and civilians in their
militant campaign for independence.
	   Milosevic, who has rejected international demands that he cease
his military campaign, reiterated that talks should begin
immediately with ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   ``There can be no other path to solving the crisis'' in Kosovo,
Belgrade media quoted him as saying at a meeting with two top
aides.
	   Holbrooke is pushing for a cease-fire first before trying to get
Milosevic to withdraw his forces. But he and other Western
officials are insistent that Kosovo should not be allowed
independence, for fear of sparking a wider Balkans war.
	   Milosevic said again that he is willing to grant the province
the autonomy that he took away in 1989.
	   Ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova emphasized Friday that
Kosovo Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of the population of 2.2
million, aren't willing to drop their independence demands.
	   ``Autonomy is not a solution,'' he told reporters in Pristina.
``Our aim is an independent, neutral Kosovo with equal rights for
all.
	   ``Kosovo was part of a country that disintegrated, so it is our
right to demand independence,'' he said.

Achieve democracy or face expulsion, Commonwealth secretary general
</HEADLINE>
tells Nigeria &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Nigeria's military government must keep its
pledges to release all political prisoners and hold democratic
elections or face expulsion from the Commonwealth of Britain and
its former colonies, the organization's secretary general said
Friday.
	   Nigerian-born Emeka Anyaoku, who has just returned from the west
African nation, where he met three times with military leader Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar, said the signs were good that Nigeria is
moving away from the repressive policies of former leader Gen. Sani
Abacha, who died last month.
	   ``What I saw in the country was a new mood, and also in my talks
with Gen. Abubakar, a new determination to end all that in the
past,'' Anyaoku said in an interview with British Broadcasting
Corp. radio.
	   ``So I don't think there is any chance of Nigeria not releasing
these people or of Nigeria not moving to democracy. I think we can
now look forward to that happening.''
	   But he added, ``If that were not to happen, of course the
Commonwealth will take the line of expelling Nigeria from their
association.''
	   Nigeria became an international pariah under the rule of Abacha,
who took power following a coup in 1993. The 54-nation Commonwealth
suspended Nigeria from its ranks after leading activist and
playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa was executed in November 1995.
	   Anyaoku said Abubakar now is ``consulting widely'' about the
best time to release Moshood Abiola, the apparent winner of
presidential elections held in 1993 that were later annulled.
Abiola was arrested a year after the vote when he declared himself
president.
	   Anyaoku said some Nigerians want Abiola to be freed immediately
``and given power with the mandate that he won in 1993.'' Others,
he said, believe Abiola should stand in another election. ``And I
believe that Gen. Abubakar is weighing all these (views) carefully
before deciding at what point to release him.''
	   Abubakar is releasing prisoners in batches, Anyaoku said,
``against the background of the possible impact that particular
prisoners, in his judgment, may have.''

North Korea doubts reconciliation festival with South
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea demanded Friday that South
Korea allow its outlawed student activists to travel to the border
to celebrate Korean Independence Day together with North Korean
citizens.
	   South Korea has already rejected that demand. And the North
Korean insistence cast doubt on the Aug. 15 ``Grand Reunification
Festival'' scheduled to be held at the border village of Panmunjom.
	   If held, the festival would be the first time the two Koreas
jointly celebrate their liberation from 36-years of Japanese
colonial rule in 1945.
	   In June, North Korea proposed that citizens from both sides
celebrate this year's anniversary at Panmunjom inside the
4-kilometer (2.5-mile)-wide demilitarized zone separating the two
Koreas.
	   South Korea has responded that it will permit all political
parties and civic groups to join the festival, except its leftist
student group, Hanchongryon, or the Korean Federation of Student
Councils.
	   The student group is outlawed for its support of key North
Korean demands, including the withdrawal of 36,000 U.S. troops from
the South and the abolishment of the South's anti-espionage
national security law.
	   ``The grand reunification festival will be meaningless without
participation of Hanchongryon,'' the North's official Korean
Central News Agency said Friday.
	   The two Koreas fought a devastating, three-year war that ended
without a peace treaty in 1953 and mutual distrust remains deep.
Their border is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
men on both sides.

Exports down in first six months of year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's coffee exports, battered by the
worst drought in a century, fell to 178,000 tons in the first six
months of 1998, a 21 percent decline from the same period last
year, the Vietnam News Agency reported Friday.
	   However, the drought forced up prices, so earnings of dlrs 286.2
million actually were up by 4 percent.
	   The Vietnam Coffee Corp. accounted for nearly a third of the
totals, shipping 57,685 tons of coffee worth dlrs 93.5 million.
	   Vietnam traditionally has raised robusta coffee but has been
increasing its crop of arabica, which currently brings in about 1.6
times the prices of robusta.
	   The central highlands, the main coffee-growing region, were hit
particularly hard by the drought, which damaged an estimated 65,000
(160,000) of the 295,000 hectares (730,000 acres) under cultivation
for coffee.
	   Damage has been estimated at dlrs 800 million.
	   Recent rains largely have eased the drought, with some areas
being swamped recently by flash floods, but a few small areas
remain parched.

of change and take China fully into the 21st Century.'' Asked if he
feels democracy could come to the world's largest nation, he said,
``Oh, yes.
	   ``I think there can be (democracy in China) and I believe there
will be.''
	   In a departing news conference, Clinton praised China for making
a ``remarkable transformation.'' China has been ruled by communists
since 1949. Clinton said he felt the ``present government, headed
by this president and this premier, who are clearly committed to
reform, (should) ride the wave of change and take China into the
21st Century.''
	   Clinton's summit meeting with President Jiang Zemin was the
highlight on his China tour, culminating in a lengthy joint news
conference televised live to the Chinese people. He met too with
Premier Zhu Rongji.
	   ``Clearly, China is changing. But there remain powerful forces
resisting change,'' Clinton told reporters, mentioning restrictions
on free speech, assembly and worship.
	   The president spoke at a news conference after meeting with
pro-democracy leader Martin Lee and separately with other Hong Kong
legislators. After the session he was returning to the United
States for the Independence Day holiday.
	   ``I don't think anyone who was on this trip could fail to
appreciate the remarkable transformation that is under way in
China, as well as the distance to be traveled,'' Clinton said,
speaking in the ballroom of a Hong Kong hotel used as a filing
center for reporters.
	   ``Here in Hong Kong we end the trip, where I hope China's future
begins,'' Clinton said, holding the city, turned over to China one
year ago, as a modern model for democratic and market reforms.
	   Asked about his accomplishments, Clinton said he and Chinese
leaders had ``reinforced our common commitment'' to regional
security, mentioning the Korean peninsula and the recent nuclear
tensions between India and Pakistan.
	   He also cited ``significant progress in nonproliferation,'' as
well as some headway on legal and environmental issues. He also
applauded an agreement to allow the Peace Corps in China.
	   Clinton said Jiang had given him assurances that he ``did not
order or authorize'' nor could he find any one in the Chinese
government who had tried to buy influence in U.S. elections through
U.S. campaign donations.
	   ``I believe him,'' Clinton said. However, Clinton said Jiang
said he could not provide he same assurances about those in the
business sector, but that he did not know of any specific examples.
	   Clinton said he hoped that, following his visit, China would
release some dissidents that are now jailed, including some who
remain in prison from the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.

Assad retires army chief-of-staff, sacks intelligence chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associate Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Syrian President Hafez Assad has ordered his
army chief-of-staff to retire and has sacked his intelligence
chief, Syrian sources said Friday.
	   Gen. Hikmat Al-Shihabi, the army chief-of-staff and a top
negotiator in peace talks with Israel, was replaced by Gen. Ali
Aslan, al-Shihabi's deputy and a veteran member of the ruling Baath
Party, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Assad signed the decree naming Aslan as the new army chief on
Wednesday.
	   The sources, contacted by telephone in Damascus, gave no reason
as to why Assad replaced al-Shihabi, who is 67.
	   The London-based Al-Hayat newspaper said al-Shihabi, a senior
member of the Baath Party and a close associate to Assad, is
expected to be named to a key civilian post.
	   Al-Shihabi was one of the few Sunni Muslim officers who joined
Assad in the 1970 coup that brought him to power. Assad is a member
of the minority Alawite sect.
	   Aslan is also an Alawite.
	   Assad also sacked Maj. Gen. Bashir al-Najar, his intelligence
chief.
	   Al-Najar was accused of ``harming the image of the regime
through wrongdoing and felonies,'' the sources said, quoting
another decree by Assad.
	   It gave no further details.
	   Al-Hayat said al-Najar was accused of illicitly videotaping
three ministers at a house of a famous Syrian belly dancer.
	   It is not clear if al-Najar, an army officer and former head of
the customs department, will retain a government post.
	   Syrian opposition leaders in Europe said al-Najar's dismissal
may have been a response to complaints of corruption and misuse of
power by intelligence officers.
	   Under Assad, Syria has followed a radical, socialist path that
has often put it at odds with other Arab states.
	   Israel and Syria have fought three major wars since the 1948
establishment of the Jewish state.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Heavy rain washed out the one-day
international cricket match between New Zealand and India at the
Sinhalese Sports Club ground in Colombo Friday.
	   New Zealand, who won the toss and batted first, were 128 for 5
in 31.1 overs when the downpour began.
	   Each team was awarded a point after the umpires decided to
abandon the match which began 30 minutes late.
	   India and Sri Lanka have six points each but India has qualified
for the finals because of a better run rate.
	   New Zealand has four points and will play their last match
against Sri Lanka, ranked second in the series, on Sunday. Should
New Zealand win the match, both teams will have six points and the
finalist will have to be decided on the basis of a better run rate.
	   The final is scheduled for July 7, a day-night match at the
Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.

Malaysian PM condemns press for maligning new airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad on Friday condemned the local press for having pilloried
Kuala Lumpur's new airport.
	   ``I'm very sad because our newspapers should be helping us
overcome problems,'' Mahathir was quoted as saying by the national
news agency, Bernama. ``Instead, they are more interested in
boosting their sales and as such they report negatively on
everything.''
	   He criticized the local media for not focusing on the positive
aspects of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, which opened for
business Monday to massive systems failures, dozens of delayed
flights and thousands of angry passengers.
	   ``There are problems at the KLIA in Sepang,'' he admitted. ``But
only these are being highlighted by our press.''
	   ``In America there was an airport which could not function at
all when it opened ... all the luggage went missing,'' Mahathir
said. ``When it happens in Malaysia, look at how sensational the
reporting is.''
	   But systems failures at the Denver International Airport in
Colorado also came under heavy media scrutiny when it opened in
1995. It was widely reported only two weeks ago, for example, that
Denver had to shuttle thousands of passengers on buses after a
computerized train failed.
	   Malaysian newspapers typically aren't critical of government
projects, often for fear of having their operating licenses yanked.
But even the government-backed New Straits Times ran a front-page
story Tuesday about opening-day chaos at KLIA.
	   Officials blamed faulty telephone cables for the breakdowns at
the dlrs 2.3 million airport.
	   Lim Kit Siang, the opposition leader in Parliament, on Friday
demanded an inquiry into the ``monumental chaos and mess at the
KLIA.''
	   The 10,000-hectare (24,700-acre) airport in the middle of oil
palm plantations has been built to accommodate millions of
passengers and faster jets so that Kuala Lumpur could compete with
nearby Bangkok and Singapore in the next century.

Aboriginal family survives two weeks in the Australian desert
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ A man walked almost 125 miles (200 kms)
through the desert for help while his family survived for two weeks
on lizards, roots and rain puddles in remote Western Australia,
police said Friday.
	   A year-old boy died but four adults survived near-freezing
nights and soaring daytime temperatures after their four-wheel
drive vehicle became bogged down in sand on the edge of the Great
Sandy Desert.
	   Police were amazed by the endurance of the man, who Thursday
stumbled upon a workcrew on a remote microwave tower between the
Outback towns of Port Hedland and Broome.
	   ``It really is miraculous that the four survived,'' Port Hedland
police Sgt. Chris Ferris said. The family's name has not be
released by police.
	   ``The endurance it took to walk 200 kilometers (125 miles) with
the cold, with dehydration and virtually nothing to eat _ it's an
amazing feat,'' Ferris said.
	   Ferris said that when he found the work crew, the man chose to
help search for his family rather than going straight to a
hospital.
	   A 36-year-old woman and a 74-year-old man were found Friday. The
elderly man had a pacemaker and the woman was an asthmatic who had
run out of medication, but they were in reasonable condition,
Ferris said.
	   A ranch owner and pilot spotted the last survivor, a 62-year-old
woman, about 50 miles (85 kms) away.
	   The woman had an injured knee and had only managed to walk about
6 miles (10 kms) from their abandoned car before she had to be left
behind with blanket and a dog to keep her warm.

PRISTINA, Yugoslavia: intimidating them.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   Sitting astride the main east-west road in the southern Yugoslav
province, Kijevo has been a flashpoint since the KLA surrounded it
in mid-June and cut off its Serb inhabitants and police. Serb
police had, in turn, surrounded the KLA fighters.
	   Holbrooke, who tried to get the KLA to break the siege last
month, has said he feared Milosevic would use massive force to
retake it, possibly resulting in tragedy.
	   Serb police sources said they had suffered no casualties in
Friday's action, which they wrapped up about 7:30 a.m. (0530 GMT),
but that the ethnic Albanians had. No other information was
immediately available.
	   The Beta news agency quoted a Serbian police source as saying
police entered Kijevo Friday morning to find some 100 Serb
civilians and about 50 policemen who had been cut off by the siege.
	   ``There is an ongoing action to search and clear the area around
Kijevo,'' the unidentified police source was quoted as saying,
confirming that some fighting was continuing.
	   Ahead of talks with Holbrooke, Milosevic denied Thursday that
Yugoslav and Serb forces are involved in repressive actions against
civilians in Kosovo.
	   Despite the crackdown that has driven tens of thousands of
ethnic Albanians from their villages, the independent FoNet news
agency quoted him as saying: ``There are not, nor will there be any
repressive actions against the civilian population in Kosovo.''
	   Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo in recent months, since
Serb forces stepped up efforts to crush militant resistance in late
February. Milosevic says the crackdown is aimed at Albanian
terrorists who have targeted Serb police and civilians in their
armed campaign for independence.
	   Milosevic, who has rejected international demands that he cease
his military campaign, reiterated that talks should begin
immediately with ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   ``There can be no other path to solving the crisis'' in Kosovo,
Belgrade media quoted him as saying at a meeting with two top
aides.
	   Holbrooke is pushing for a cease-fire first before trying to get
Milosevic to withdraw his forces. But he and other Western
officials are insistent that Kosovo should not be allowed
independence, for fear of sparking a wider Balkans war.
	   Milosevic said again that he is willing to grant the province
the autonomy that he took away in 1989.
	   Ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova emphasized Friday that
Kosovo Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of the province's
population of 2.2 million, aren't willing to drop their
independence demands.
	   ``Autonomy is not a solution,'' he told reporters in Pristina.
``Our aim is an independent, neutral Kosovo with equal rights for
all. Kosovo was part of a country that disintegrated, so it is our
right to demand independence.''

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces reportedly
recaptured a key crossroads village in Kosovo on Friday, breaking a
more than two-week-long siege by ethnic Albanian militants.
	   The retaking of Kijevo, which U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke this
week called ``the most dangerous place in Europe,'' was reported by
Serb sources and the independent Beta news agency in the Yugoslav
capital Belgrade. It could not immediately be confirmed.
	   Serb police said ethnic Albanian fighters suffered casualties.
They did not elaborate.
	   Journalists who tried to reach the blocked-off area late
Thursday encountered no audible combat but found access barred by
tense guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army. Roads to the area
25 kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina were blocked Friday.
	   The reported retaking of Kijevo came hours before U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke was due in Belgrade for new talks with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Earlier reports by Serb media suggested that retaking the
Serb-populated village was the remaining goal of the latest
crackdown by Milosevic's forces in the secessionist province. The
other was the recapture of the strategic Belacevac mine region,
which they accomplished Tuesday after two days of nearly non-stop
fighting.
	   Underscoring the high tensions throughout Kosovo, a
remote-controlled bomb exploded early Friday in a Serb residential
area of the capital Pristina. No injuries but several cars were
damaged, which Serb police blamed on the KLA.
	   Also, Yugoslav fighter jets continued their recent tactic of
flying low over the city. Ethnic Albanians say the buzzing is aimed
at intimidating them.
	   Sitting astride the main east-west road in the southern Yugoslav
province, Kijevo has been a flashpoint since the KLA surrounded it
in mid-June and cut off its Serb inhabitants and police. Serb
police had then surrounded the KLA fighters.
	   Holbrooke, who tried to get the KLA to break the siege last
month, has said he feared Milosevic would use massive force to
retake it, possibly resulting in tragedy.
	   Serb police sources said they had suffered no casualties in

ethnic Albanians had. No other information was immediately
available.
	   The Beta news agency quoted a Serbian police source as saying

civilians and about 50 policemen who had been cut off by the siege.
	   ``There is an ongoing action to search and clear the area around
Kijevo,'' the unidentified police source was quoted as saying,
confirming some fighting still continuing. The source said the
action had been done ``professionally.''
	   Ahead of talks with Holbrooke, Milosevic denied Thursday that
Yugoslav and Serb forces are involved in repressive actions against
civilians in Kosovo.
	   Despite the crackdown that has driven tens of thousands of
ethnic Albanians from their villages, the independent FoNet news

``Our aim is an independent, neutral Kosovo with equal rights for
all.''
	   In Geneva, spokesman Kris Janowski of the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees said Friday that this week's fighting at Belacevac had
added an undetermined number to those displaced by Kosovo unrest.
He said the UNHCR's conservative estimate was 52,000 displaced in
the province, excluding Belacevac, with the real figure ``probably
up to 70,000 or so.''

Thai central bank tries to push debt restructuring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank said Friday a
joint public and private sector committee has started working on
the restructuring of tens of billions of dollars in domestic bad
debt.
	   Restructuring bad debt held by banks and finance companies is
considered a crucial step for Thailand, a year into the Asian
economic crisis, to emerge from its worst recession in decades.
	   Tarisa Watanagase, director of the Bank of Thailand's department
for regulation of financial institutions, said that under
guidelines in a new bankruptcy law, restructuring plans for 18
cases should be ready in 110 days.
	   Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda said last month that
although talks between the private sector and foreign creditors had
begun, Thai banks were hesitant to move forward because they lack
experience with restructuring.
	   The debt restructuring committee was created to bring debtors
and creditors to the table and provide them with experts to help
determine asset values and assist in renegotiating loan terms.
	   On Thursday, at the committee's second meeting, lists of
restructuring cases prepared by the six organizations represented
were compared. Three struggling companies were assigned to working
committee members from each organization.
	   The committee is headed by the central bank governor, Chatu
Mongkol Sonakul.
	   Creditors are represented by the Foreign Banks' Association,
Thai Bankers Association and the Association of Finance Companies.
Debtors are represented by the Board of Trade and the Federation of
Thai Industries.

Asian stock markets close generally lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended the week generally
lower Friday, with the key index in Hong Kong tumbling 2.6 percent
because of disappointment over Japan's latest plan to clean up its
financial sector.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chips, fell 226.85 points, or 2.6 percent, to close at
8,639.31. On Thursday, the index had surged 323.06 points, or 3.8
percent.
	   Brokers said share prices opened sharply lower because investors
considered Japan's ``bridge banks'' plan to clean up the banking
system as insufficient.
	   Bridge banks would make it easier for the Japanese government to
allow ailing banks to go bankrupt while preventing a collapse of
confidence in the already-shaky financial system.
	   ``The market had built in high expectation the day before.
That's why the market rallied yesterday ,'' said George Chan,
research analyst at Cheerful Securities Ltd.
	   In Tokyo, the key index closed higher for the eighth straight
day, after the prime minister voiced support for tax cuts.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 39.66 points, or 0.24
percent, to close at 16,511.24.
	   The Nikkei fell most the day on profit taking but soared more
than 200 points in the last hour of trading after Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto said in a campaign speech that he will favor
permanent tax cuts.
	   In currency trading, the U.S. dlr was quoted at 139.24 yen in
late trading, up 0.06 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but well
below its late New York rate of 140.95 yen overnight.
	   The dollar had risen most of the day, driven by disappointment
with the government's long-awaited plan for cleaning up Japan's bad
debt-ridden banking system.
	   Elsewhere:
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed lower on profit-taking. The
Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 4.24 points, or 1.5 percent,
to 273.74.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower, dragged down by a strong
sell-off in technology stocks. The market's key Weighted Stock
Price Index fell 58.48 points, or 0.7 percent, to 7,758.63.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower on
profit-taking. The NZSE-40 Capital Index 11.16 points, or 0.5
percent, to 2,043.04.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed generally lower, but advancing

Serbs reportedly regain control of key Kosovo crossroads
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Combines previous; trims to tighten. Holbrooke-Milosevic talks
set to begin at 1600 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces reportedly
recaptured a key crossroads village in Kosovo on Friday, breaking a
siege by ethnic Albanian militants that lasted more than two weeks.
	   The retaking of Kijevo, which U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke this
week called ``the most dangerous place in Europe,'' was reported by
Serb sources and the independent Beta news agency in the Yugoslav
capital Belgrade. It could not immediately be confirmed.
	   Serb police said ethnic Albanian fighters suffered casualties
but did not elaborate.
	   Journalists who tried to reach the blocked-off area late
Thursday heard no sounds of combat but found access barred by tense
guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army. Roads to the area 25
kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina were blocked Friday.
	   The reported retaking of Kijevo came hours before Holbrooke was
due in Belgrade for new talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
	   Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo in recent months, since
Serb forces stepped up efforts to crush militant resistance in late
February. Milosevic says the crackdown is aimed at Albanian
terrorists who have targeted Serb police and civilians in their
armed campaign for independence. Ethnic Albanians comprise 90
percent of Kosovo's population of 2.2 million.
	   Earlier reports by Serb media suggested that the retaking of the
Serb-populated village was the remaining goal of the latest
crackdown by Milosevic's forces in the secessionist province. The
other was the recapture of the strategic Belacevac mine region,
which they accomplished Tuesday after two days of almost non-stop
fighting.
	   Underscoring the high tensions throughout Kosovo, a
remote-controlled bomb exploded early Friday in a Serb residential
area of the capital Pristina. No injuries were reported, but
several cars were damaged in the blast, which Serb police blamed on
the KLA.
	   Yugoslav fighter jets continued their recent tactic of flying
low over the city. Ethnic Albanians say the buzzing is aimed at
intimidating them.
	   Sitting astride the main east-west road in the southern Yugoslav
province, Kijevo has been a flashpoint since the KLA surrounded it
in mid-June and cut off its Serb inhabitants and police. Serb
police had, in turn, surrounded the KLA fighters.
	   Holbrooke, who tried to get the KLA to break the siege last
month, has said he feared Milosevic would use massive force to
retake it.
	   Serb police sources said they had suffered no casualties in
Friday's action, which they wrapped up about 7:30 a.m. (0530 GMT),
but that the ethnic Albanians had. No other information was
immediately available.
	   The Beta news agency quoted a Serbian police source as saying
police entered Kijevo Friday morning to find some 100 Serb
civilians and about 50 policemen who had been cut off by the siege.
	   ``There is an ongoing action to search and clear the area around
Kijevo,'' the unidentified police source was quoted as saying,
confirming that some fighting was continuing.
	   Ahead of talks with Holbrooke, Milosevic denied Thursday that
Yugoslav and Serb forces are involved in repressive actions against
civilians in Kosovo.
	   Despite the crackdown that has driven tens of thousands of
ethnic Albanians from their villages, the independent FoNet news
agency quoted him as saying: ``There are not, nor will there be any
repressive actions against the civilian population in Kosovo.''
	   Milosevic, who has rejected international demands that he cease
his military campaign, reiterated that talks should begin
immediately with ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   Holbrooke is pushing for a cease-fire first before trying to get
Milosevic to withdraw his forces. But he and other Western
officials are insistent that Kosovo should not be allowed
independence, for fear of sparking a wider Balkans war.
	   Milosevic said again that he is willing to grant the province
the autonomy that he took away in 1989.
	   Ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova emphasized Friday that
Kosovo Albanians aren't willing to drop their independence demands.
	   ``Autonomy is not a solution,'' he told reporters in Pristina.
``Our aim is an independent, neutral Kosovo with equal rights for
all.''

	   ROME (AP) _ Hospitals went on full alert to cope with

blamed for at least six deaths in Italy.
	   The highest temperatures were reported in Sicily, with the

Clinton wraps up China tour saying China could be a democracy

Northern Ireland, Cuba, etc. &QL;  combines pvs &QL;

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ President Bill Clinton wrapped up his nine-day
tour of China Friday, calling on Beijing leaders to ``ride the wave
of change and take China fully into the 21st Century.'' Asked if he
feels democracy could come to the world's largest nation, he said,
``Oh, yes.
	   ``I think there can be (democracy in China) and I believe there
will be.''
	   In a departing news conference, Clinton praised China for making
a ``remarkable transformation.'' China has been ruled by communists
since 1949. He said China would recognize that ``democracy is the
right course practically as well as morally.
	   Speaking in the ballroom of a Hong Kong hotel, Clinton said the
``present government, headed by this president and this premier,
who are clearly committed to reform, (should) ride the wave of
change and take China into the 21st Century.''
	   Asked if he could name a timeframe for when communism would end
in China, Clinton said, ``That's like saying ... Do I believe a
woman will be elected president of the United States. I do. Do I
think it will be a good thing? I do. Do I know when it will happen?
I don't.''
	   Clinton's summit meeting with President Jiang Zemin was the
highlight on his China tour, culminating in a lengthy joint news
conference televised live to the Chinese people. He met too with
Premier Zhu Rongji.
	   ``Clearly, China is changing. But there remain powerful forces
resisting change,'' Clinton told reporters, mentioning restrictions
on free speech, assembly and worship.
	   The president spoke at a news conference after meeting with
pro-democracy leader Martin Lee and separately with other Hong Kong
legislators. After the session he was returning to the United
States for the Independence Day holiday.
	   In his remarks to reporters, Clinton also defended his decision
not to meet individually with dissidents. He said his direct
engagement of Chinese leaders could do more to ``advance the cause
of human rights'' than meeting with dissidents. To the dissidents,
Clinton said, ``The United States is on your side and we did our
best.''
	   He was asked two questions on other foreign affairs matters.
	   _ Clinton would ``not rule out any options'' on ways of ending
the bloodshed in Kosovo, saying that NATO was continuing its
planning. He suggested the government of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic ``is primarily responsible'' for ending the
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in the sothern Serbina province. But,
noting recent victories by rebels, Clinton added, ``I think that
others when they're having a good day, or a good week on the
military front, may also be reluctant to engage in dialogue.''
	   _ He expressed dismay at two nights of attacks by arsonists on
churches and schools in Northern Ireland and said he had talked to
leaders there. ``I feel personally horrible about what is happening
to the churches,'' Clinton said.
	   But most of the session was devoted to his China trip and a
policy of engagement that has infuriated some in Congress who feel
Clinton should apply more pressure on Beijing to further human
rights and other reforms. Clinton defended the policy while
expressing disappointment that no significant progress was made in
loosening Chinese trade restrictions.
	   Clinton said he would like to get ``some clear signal'' that
Cuba is interested in establishing a constructive relationship with
the United States, as China has. ``Nothing would please me more
than to see some rapprochement between the people of our two
countries,'' Clinton said.
	   ``I don't think anyone who was on this trip could fail to
appreciate the remarkable transformation that is under way in
China, as well as the distance to be traveled,'' Clinton said.
	   ``Here in Hong Kong we end the trip, where I hope China's future
begins,'' Clinton said, holding the city, turned over to China one
year ago, as a modern model for democratic and market reforms.
	   Asked about his accomplishments, Clinton said he and Chinese
leaders had ``reinforced our common commitment'' to regional
security, mentioning the Korean peninsula and the recent nuclear
tensions between India and Pakistan.
	   He also cited ``significant progress in nonproliferation,'' as
well as some headway on legal and environmental issues. He also
applauded an agreement to allow the Peace Corps in China.
	   Clinton said Jiang had given him assurances that he ``did not
order or authorize'' nor could he find any one in the Chinese
government who had tried to buy influence in U.S. elections through
U.S. campaign donations.
	   ``I believe him,'' Clinton said. However, Clinton said Jiang
said he could not provide he same assurances about those in the
business sector, but that he did not know of any specific examples.
	   Clinton said he hoped that, following his visit, China would
release some dissidents that are now jailed, including some who
remain in prison from the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.a
	   ``Over the past week we have seen the glory of China's past in
Xian,'' where his five-city tour began, Clinton said in an opening
statement. ``... I don't think anyone who was on this trip could
fail to appreciate the remarkable transformation that is underway
in China, as well as the distance to be traveled.
	   ``... we end the trip in a place where I hope China' future
begins,'' he said of Hong Kong.
	   Earlier, Clinton told Hong Kong business and community leaders,
``I look forward to the day when all of the people of Hong Kong
realize the rights and responsibilities of full democracy.''

Chief of staff undercuts Netanyahu's security claims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Undercutting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Israel's outgoing military chief suggested Friday that a troop
pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank, as proposed by the
United States, would not endanger Israel's security.
	   Netanyahu has resisted the U.S. plan for months, saying a
withdrawal from 13 percent of the land would harm Israel's security
interests. He insists that Israel can hand over no more than 9
percent. Israel captured the territory from Jordan in 1967,
	   However, in recent days there has been a noticable shift in
Netanyahu's argument, with the prime minister now saying the
Palestinians' refusal to carry out their security obligations was
holding up agreement.
	   Lt. Gen. Amnon Shahak, who completes his term next week, said
the relationship between the size of withdrawal and the security of
Israel was not as clearcut as Netanyahu was making it out to be.
	   ``The way I see it, the difference between 11 and 13 percent, or
9 and 13 percent _ it's not that it is trivial, not that it is
unimportant _ but it is certainly not very, very dramatic,'' Shahak
said in a farewell interview on Israel army radio.
	   ``The main thing is not only the size of the land given back,
but under what conditions and in what atmosphere ...,'' Shahak
said.
	   Shahak was a key player in the negotiations with the
Palestinians on the 1995 autonomy agreement, and Israeli media have
speculated that he will join the opposition Labor Party after
leaving the army.
	   Shahak and Netanyahu have had an often turbulent relationship
and reportedly have not met privately for months. Last month,
Netanyahu cut short a Shahak briefing to the Cabinet about the
peace process, saying the army chief was touching upon issues that
were none of his concern.
	   The two also came into conflict over Netanyahu's claim that the
army backed his September 1996 decision to open a new entrance to a
tourist tunnel near Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem's Old City. The
opening led to riots that killed 80 people.
	   Shahak, who has been chief of staff since January 1995, will
complete his term on Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl may be trailing in
his bid for re-election, but there's one race where he's way ahead:
the garden gnome hit parade.
	   According to statistics presented Friday by the German Garden
Gnome Museum, Kohl's portly figure is the basis for 14 versions of
gnomes, some plaster, some plastic. That's not even counting the
various colors they come in.
	   In second place with six versions is Kohl's short and plump
labor minister, Norbert Bluem, who confessed at the Bonn news
conference: ``I'm my own favorite garden gnome.''
	   Rudolf Scharping, the Social Democrat who lost to Kohl in the
1994 election, has four versions of himself, while this year's
opposition candidate, Gerhard Schroeder, has only one.
	   Schroeder, though, can console himself with the latest polls,
which show him eight points ahead of Kohl with less than three
months to go to the Sept. 27 election.

Cambodia's Hun Sen says he's no monster; opponent disagrees

CORRECTS geography of Pursat province, 3rd graf

<TEXT>
	   ROLANG KEN, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen depicted
himself as a sentimental songwriter Friday, while one of his chief
opponents in the July 26 parliamentary elections branded him a
murderer.
	   The conflicting portrayals follow accusations that Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party is using fear and violence, including the
slayings of political opponents, to ensure victory in the polls.
	   Hun Sen presented his softer side Friday in remarks villagers at
Rolang Ken, 25 kilometers (15 miles) west of the capital, Phnom
Penh.
	   Hun Sen said that he has composed more than 100 songs, many
about love and his difficult peasant childhood, that sometimes make
him weep.
	   ``It is a big misunderstanding to call Hun Sen a monster,'' Hun
Sen said. ``I never call myself a strongman. Strongman is what
other people call me, and neither am I a stubborn man.''
	   But leading dissident Sam Rainsy, campaigning before 1,500
people in the southwestern province of Pursat, accused Hun Sen of
ordering a grenade attack last year against a peaceful protest that
killed at least 16 people and injuring more than 100.
	   Sam Rainsy, one of Hun Sen's most vocal critics, was slightly
injured and was presumed to be the target.
	   ``Hun Sen is the one who ordered the grenades to be thrown,''
Sam Rainsy said. ``He is a brutal person. By wanting to kill just
Sam Rainsy, he was not afraid to have grenades thrown at innocent
people.''
	   On Wednesday, six gift-wrapped parcels containing explosives
were reportedly delivered to a provincial rally of the Sam Rainsy
Party. Party officials accused Hun Sen's organization of
intimidation.
	   Hun Sen took nearly full control of Cambodia a year ago by
deposing Prince Norodom Ranariddh, with whom he served a tense
co-premiership after U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993.
	   The U.S. Embassy warned U.S. citizens Friday to take special
precautions during the anniversary July 5-7 of the bloody street
battles and looting that accompanied Ranariddh's ouster.
	   The embassy said Americans ``should avoid political gatherings
or demonstrations, avoid the vicinity of political party or
military buildings or compounds and exercise caution in crowds of
any sort.''
	   The prince returned from exile in March and, with Sam Rainsy, is
considered one of Hun Sen's chief challenger.
	   About 100 of the prince's supporters were killed in the months
after the coup. A U.N. human-rights report Wednesday said that four
apparently political killings rank among 140 reported cases of
violence and intimidation investigated since mid-May.
	   Hun Sen has called the elections to win back international aid
and legitimacy, but critics say he has stacked the process in his
favor.
	   At the historic Angkor temple area in northern Cambodia, a hotel
has refused to rent its four white elephants to a small party that
has a white elephant symbol, fearing the beasts might be attacked
in a political dispute.

Iraq asks Interpol to extradite 84 opponents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraq has asked Interpol for the extradition
of 84 Iraqi exiles that Baghdad has accused of skimming money from
the state budget, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The 84 exiles include diplomats, army officers and businessmen
who were granted political asylum abroad, the London-based Asharq
Al-Awsat said.
	   Included on the list is Maj. Gen. Wafiq al-Samarrai, a former
head of military intelligence who has sought asylum in Britain.
	   Al-Samarrai fled Iraq in 1995 and joined opposition groups
trying to topple the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
	   Last month, Saddam ordered his government to pursue exiled
Iraqis it has accused of stealing government money and lashed out
at foreign countries which have granted asylum to Iraqi exiles.
	   Asharq Al-Awsat, quoting Iraqi diplomats in Jordan, said that
Baghdad claims that the exiles are criminals and not political
activists and should not be granted asylum.
	   Thousands of Iraqis have fled the country since the end of the
1991 Gulf War and have sought political asylum mostly in the United
States and Europe.

At end of China trip, Clinton meets pro-democracy leader Lee
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead to ADD context &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ After avoiding public appearances with Chinese
dissidents throughout his trip, President Bill Clinton met Friday
with pro-democracy lawmaker Martin Lee, who said he wants Clinton's
visit to yield ``concrete results'' on political reform in China.
	   To show support for politicians and democratic reformers in Hong
Kong, Clinton met with Lee, the leader of Hong Kong's Democratic
Party, and several others among the 20 legislators who won recent
legislative elections.
	   Lee said Clinton's trip has been successful in launching a new
openness in China, but he wants to see solid steps toward reform
both in Hong Kong and on the mainland.
	   ``The door in China has been opened a bit,'' Lee said. ``We in
Hong Kong want to see the door open wider. We hope to see concrete
results of Mr. Clinton's visit _ a faster pace of reform in terms
of human rights, the rule of law and democracy.''
	   Clinton and Lee, who last met in April 1997 in Washington,
talked for about 20 minutes. After that session, Clinton met with
some of Hong Kong's elected leaders, who said he spent most of the
time listening to them.
	   The group included Democrats and other pro-democracy politicians
recently voted into the legislature in the first elections since
the territory returned to Chinese rule a year ago. Only a third of
the legislature was elected by direct popular vote.
	   Those meeting with Clinton included both critics and backers of
Beijing who won election by popular vote in the May 24 election.
	   Lee's Democrats won 13 of 60 seats in the legislature, which
convened for the first time on Thursday. Despite election rules
guaranteeing that a pro-Beijing elite would dominate, the Democrats
and their allies control a third of the assembly.
	   They have little real power, but claim the moral authority to
push for a faster transition to full democracy.
	   Lee and other Democrats say Hong Kong's 6.5 million people have
retained most of their freedoms since China regained sovereignty.
However, the powerful Hong Kong economy has been dragged into
recession by Asia's economic woes.
	   Lee said he told Clinton that ``if Hong Kong can keep basic
values of freedom and democracy, it would be a tremendous help to
(the) entire region.''
	   ``I noted that you cannot separate economic and political
freedom and expect economic prosperity to last,'' Lee said. ``Rule
of law, a level playing field, a government that is open,
accountable, and responsive ... all these cannot last long without
a strong democratic base.''
	   Chinese leaders should look at the Hong Kong example ``and see
that there is nothing to fear from democratic elections or indeed,
democratically elected leaders,'' Lee said. ``Democracy works well
in a Chinese community, under Chinese rule.''
	   Populist Emily Lau of the Frontier movement said she told
Clinton that the full legislature and Hong Kong's chief executive
must be directly elected.
	   Tsang Yok-sing, chairman of the pro-China Democratic Alliance
for the Betterment of Hong Kong, called the meeting ``a clear
breakthrough,'' and said it had ``good implications for Hong
Kong.''

World Cup: Croatia seeks revenge against Germany
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ For his 100th game as coach, Berti Vogts
could get no better present from his German team.
	   A victory over Croatia in Lyon on Saturday would take Germany to
the semifinals of the World Cup, Vogts' minimum goal in France.
	   ``I really want to win this game, not because it's my 100th, but
because my team deserves it, they have worked so hard,'' Vogts said
Friday.
	   Vogts took over from Franz Beckenbauer after Germany won the
1990 World Cup in Italy. In 1994 in the United States, Germany was
eliminated by Bulgaria in the quarterfinals.
	   Vogts' record is 66-22-11 and includes the European Championship
title in 1996 and a runner-up finish in 1992. If he adds a World
Cup title _ Germany's fourth _ Vogts would join Beckenbauer and
Mario Zagallo of Brazil with championships as both a player and a
coach.
	   Germany beat Croatia 2-1 in the European quarterfinals two years
ago, an ill-tempered, foul-filled match in which Croatia finished
with 10 men. The Croats still believe they should have won at Old
Trafford.
	   German captain Juergen Klinsmann, who scored one of the goals in
that match, admits that he was lucky to escape without a red card
for a vicious foul.
	   ``We know them and we know that it will be a hard job. They have
skilled individuals. And they were very aggressive in Manchester,''
Klinsmann said. ``We have to take charge early and keep the pace
fast. I hope it won't be like in Manchester.
	   ``With all due respect to Croatia, however, it's really up to us
and I am very optimistic. We want to go to Paris (for the semifinal
July 8) and it really depends only on us.''
	   Vogts said his team should expect Croatia to be aggressive.
	   ``But we have to remain cool and focus on our strengths,'' he
said, ``and I believe if we do so, we have a very good chance of
qualifying.''
	   Croatia's coach, Miroslav Blazevic, and his players believe
Germany is vulnerable.
	   ``I hope we won't stop now because Germany is beatable. We can
go all the way,'' Blazevic said.
	   But he was also cautious.
	   ``I respect the Germans as a team. I fear this match. We're
playing one of the biggest teams in the world, it's normal to be
worried,'' Blazevic said.
	   Most members of the 1996 Croat team are back in France for the
World Cup. They include striker Davor Suker, who scored the goal
against Germany and has three at the World Cup.
	   ``He will score against Germany, I promise you,'' Blazevic said.
	   Igor Stimac, a Croatian forward, said his team was eager for the
chance to avenge the 1996 defeat.
	   ``The Germans are always able to win the World Cup. It's always
the same. Two years ago they were playing the worst football I've
ever seen and they won the game,'' Stimac said.
	   ``We have two more years of experience with more big games in
our legs and we expect to give them a good revenge. But we are
positive in our minds, we don't think we're going to do something
bad during the game.''

Clinton blames Belgrade for Kosovo impasse, but says other

 &UR; With BC-China-Clinton &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ President Bill Clinton said Friday that the
Yugoslav government of President Slobodan Milosevic bears primary
responsibility for the continued fighting in Kosovo, but that other
parties in the conflict, encouraged by some military success,
``have also been reluctant to actually engage in dialogue.''
	   Clinton said he had been kept up to date on the Kosovo situation
during his nine-day trip to China, which ended Friday, and that the
United States and its NATO allies have not ruled out any options to
end the violence.
	   ``The only way it will ultimately be resolved is if the parties
get together and resolve it through some negotiation and
dialogue,'' Clinton told a news conference.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke was to meet later Friday with
Milosevic even as the fighting continued to rage in the Serbian
province.
	   ``I think that Belgrade is primarily responsible here,'' Clinton
said when asked about a lack of progress in bringing the burgeoning
civil war to a halt. ``But I think that others, when they're having
a good day or a good week on the military front, may also be
reluctant to actually engage in dialogue.''
	   Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo since Serb forces stepped
up efforts in late February to crush militant resistance by ethnic
Albaniansm, who make up the province's majority. Milosevic says the
crackdown is aimed at Albanian terrorists who have targeted Serb
police and civilians in their militant campaign for independence.
	   ``The conflict is going on. Both sides are involved in it. There
is some uncertainty about who is willing and who is not willing to
even negotiate about it. And we're working on it as best we can,''
he said.

	   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ President Bill Clinton wrapped up his nine-day
tour of China Friday, calling on Beijing leaders to ``ride the wave
of change and take China fully into the 21st century.'' Asked if he
feels democracy could come to the world's largest nation, he said,
``Oh, yes.'' He said China would recognize that ``democracy is the
right course practically as well as morally. Before leaving Hong
Kong, Clinton said the present government is committed to reform.
``Clearly, China is changing. But there remain powerful forces
resisting change,'' Clinton said, mentioning restrictions on free
speech, assembly and worship. After the session he was returning to
the United States for the Independence Day holiday. (CLINTON-CHINA)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces reportedly
recaptured a key crossroads village in Kosovo on Friday, breaking a
more than two-week siege by ethnic Albanian militants. The retaking
of Kijevo, which U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke this week called
``the most dangerous place in Europe,'' was reported by Serb
sources and the independent Beta news agency in the Yugoslav
capital, Belgrade. It could not immediately be confirmed. Serb
police said ethnic Albanian fighters suffered casualties. They did
not elaborate. Roads to the area 25 kilometers (15 miles) west of
Pristina were blocked Friday. The report came hours before
Holbrooke was due in Belgrade for talks with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Threats of labor unrest soared Friday
after South Korea announced it will privatize 11 state-owned
corporations to increase efficiency and attract solely needed
foreign investment. The militant Korean Confederation of Trade
Unions called for a new wave of strikes to fight increased
restructuring and layoffs and also demanded a freeze on South
Korea's annual dlrs 2.8 billion in arms purchases. Responding to
the strike call, workers at Hyundai Motors Co., South Korea's
largest automaker, said they will walk off the assembly lines for
two days starting Monday as a prelude to a bigger strike later this
month. (SKOREA-LABOR UNREST)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The World Bank has approved a dlrs 1 billion
loan for Indonesia that was put on hold after rioting and political
upheaval forced President Suharto to resign in May, and a bank
official predicted a dlrs 6 billion package from the IMF would soon
follow. Dennis de Tray, the bank's country director for Indonesia,
said Thursday that dlrs 600 million of the dlrs 1 billion loan was
disbursed after the executive board approved it. He said he saw no
difficulty in Indonesian President B.J. Habibie's government
fulfilling the conditions to receive the remaining dlrs 400
million, probably in September. De Tray also said a dlrs 6 billion
package the International Monetary Fund is putting together would
be ready in a matter of weeks. (WORLD BANK-INDONESIA)
	   ROLANG KEN, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen depicted
himself as a sentimental songwriter Friday, while one of his chief
opponents in the July 26 parliamentary elections branded him a
murderer. The conflicting portrayals follow accusations that Hun
Sen's Cambodian People's Party is using fear and violence,
including the slayings of political opponents, to ensure victory in
the polls. Hun Sen presented his softer side to villagers in Rolang
Ken, 25 kilometers (15 miles) west of the capital, Phnom Penh. ``It
is a big misunderstanding to call Hun Sen a monster,'' he said. But
leading dissident Sam Rainsy, campaigning before 1,500 people in
the southwestern province of Pursat, accused Hun Sen of ordering a
grenade attack last year against a peaceful protest that killed at
least 16 people and injuring more than 100, including Rainsy
himself. (CAMBODIA-ELECTIONS)

Unemployment drops in Germany for third straight month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German unemployment dropped in June to 10.5
percent, continuing a downward trend that the government said
showed the country's economic upswing was gaining strength.
	   Releasing the figures four days ahead of schedule, government
spokesman Otto Hauser said 120,000 fewer Germans were registered as
unemployed in June, compared to the month before.
	   That put the rate in June at 10.5 percent, compared with 10.9
percent in May and 11.1 percent in June 1997.
	   In all, some 4.075 million Germans were unemployed in June,
Hauser said, adding that the figure should drop below the
psychologically significant 4 million mark by fall.
	   Unemployment, which hit a postwar high of 12.6 percent in
February, is the key issue in national elections Sept. 27, and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has been quick to cite the latest decline as
evidence that his government is on the right track.
	   Hauser said Germany's economic recovery was gaining ``breadth
and dynamic'' and showed the government's reform course is taking
hold.

20 Vietnamese bodies found in mass grave
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A mass grave containing the bodies of 20
Vietnamese soldiers was found late last month in Quang Tri
province, the Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan reported Friday.
	   About 300,000 Vietnamese soldiers remain missing in action a
quarter-century after the Vietnam War ended.
	   The paper said the grave was found by scrap-iron scavengers in
the Cam Lo district along National Highway 9, which links the
central town of Dong Ha to Khe Sanh, a former U.S. military base.
	   Believed to have been killed between 1968 and 1970, the soldiers
were buried with a number of personal belongings, including knives,
guns and hammocks.
	   The remains have been recovered and reburied in Cam Lo's war
cemetery.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ This city resounds almost nightly with
horn-honking cheers during the World Cup, no matter if the soccer
victors are from Germany or Brazil, Nigeria or Croatia.
	   That's because Frankfurt defies the image of German homogeneity:
About a third of the 600,000 residents hold foreign passports.
Bankers, store clerks and refugees from around the world make their
home in this compact financial capital on the Main River.
	   But Frankfurt lacks the established ethnic quarters and street
parades of bigger metropolises. So, the World Cup gives Frankfurt's
foreigners a chance to show their colors _ with vigor.
	   Soccer's biggest prize is being contested in neighboring France,
and Germans are all agog because their national team is also in the
running.
	   Not long after Croatia's 1-0 win Tuesday over Romania, convoys
of cars decked with Croatia's red-white-and-blue flag snaked
through downtown in what locals have come to call a ``Hupkonzert,''
or ``honking concert.''
	   Bartender Vlad Milanovic slapped high-fives on fellow Croats
hanging out of car windows with streamers and megaphones in front
of a Croat-run cafe on Frankfurt's main shopping avenue, the Zeil.
	   Many Croats in Frankfurt are refugees from the Bosnian war and
don't feel comfortable enough in their new land to show their
ethnicity too overtly, Milanovic said, because Germans sometimes
link them with crime.
	   ``But tonight it's a celebration,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter
what country you're in.''
	   Less than a soccer field's length away, British expatriates
huddled near a pub's TV set for the England-Argentina match.
	   ``We're showing our support here,'' said computer programmer
Graham Harrington. ``But you won't hear us out on the street
honking later if we win.''
	   ``Because we'll be too drunk to drive,'' added his friend, James
Stoker, a shiatsu masseuse.
	   There was to be no celebration anyway for the English, who lost
to their former Falklands War enemy in a 4-3 penalty shootout
following a 2-2 draw.
	   Frankfurt has the highest percentage of foreigners of any German
city, not even counting naturalized citizens or ethnic Germans born
elsewhere, such as the former Soviet Union, who have resettled here
in recent years. The main foreign groups are Turks, Croats and
Italians, but there also are populations of Asians, Africans, Latin
Americans.
	   Aside from banking positions, foreigners have been attracted to
the city's central European location and entry-level, blue-collar
jobs in services and construction.
	   In Frankfurt, rapidly becoming Europe's financial headquarters
as the seat of the European Central Bank, ethnic groups mix mostly
peacefully and Frankfurters are relatively tolerant of foreigners.
That is in contrast to some German cities, especially in the former
communist East, where foreign group sometimes target each other or
are attacked by young neo-Nazi thugs.
	   The city's neighborhoods are not differentiated; side by side
are Indian-run electronics shops, Asian supermarkets, Italian ice
cream parlors.
	   On soccer nights, euphoric shouts from fans in one apartment or
cafe are often answered minutes later by shouts from fans of the
opposing team down the street.

Nevis Premier finds niche in Small Islands conference
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUSAN LINNEE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LE REDUIT, Mauritius (AP) _ Vance W. Amory may have had to
travel half way around the world, but he could not have found a a
forum more interested in what he had to say.
	   The Premier of Nevis, which makes up one-half the tiny,
independent Caribbean island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, came to
explain to an international conference on small islands why he
wants to make it even smaller.
	   The International Small Islands Studies Association has no say
in whether Amory and his Concerned Citizens Movement succeed in
breaking away from the federation formed with St. Kitts at
independence from Britain in 1983.
	   His government is drawing up a constitution and plans to hold a
referendum among the 10,000 inhabitants of the 36-sq. mile (94-sq.
km) island in the Leeward chain in the next three months.
	   But many of the members of ISISA _ a laid-back, flexible group
of scholars, researchers and just plain island lovers who are
meeting in their fifth international gathering on this western
Indian Ocean island _ are intrigued by the example of a small,
vulnerable island trying to go it alone.
	   ``I don't think the issue of a small base or a small area should
be the prescribing issue of whether a country should be sovereign
but whether it can sustain itself,'' Amory told the conference.
	   Sustainable development is a major concern of participants who
come from 28 nations and islands from Papua New Guinea and Fiji to
Antigua.
	   Nevis has established an off-shore financial operation and does
well on upmarket tourism. But Amory says St. Kitts _ two miles away
_ spends only 21 percent of the federation's budget on Nevis while
the island provides 38 percent of the federation's tax revenue.
	   Amory's adviser and junior minister Colin Tyrell, found out by
accident about the Small Islands conference over the Internet
through political scientist Barry Bartmann of Canada's Prince
Edward Island University.
	   ``Since I'm extremely interested in the process of secession, I
posted a question about Nevis on the St. Kitts' website,'' Bartmann
said during a break in conference proceedings.
	   If Nevis succeeds, it would become the latest in a group of
miniscule independent islands that already includes Paulu, Nauru
and Tuvalu, all in the South Pacific.
	   Economist Robert Read of England's Lancaster University says
political viability, not economic sustainability, would be the true
test for Nevis _ and secession is not an internationally favored
way to solve grievances within federations.
	   But, he said, ``if you've got 10 or 12,000 people who are
cohesive, cooperative and motivated, you can go a long way.''
	   As many Nevisians live outside the island as live on it _ in the
United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. And Amory says many
are anxious to return.
	   Read pointed out that an independent Nevis would enter the world
as a member of the Federation of Eastern Caribbean States. It would
continue to use the Eastern Caribbean dollar that is pegged to the
U.S. dollar and would not have to worry about a stable currency or
interest rates _ which have already been set by a higher
institution.
	   In fact, he said, despite its tininess and insularity, Nevis
would be in much better shape than the Ukraine or other former
Soviet republics that have had to create their economies and
economic institutions from scratch.
	   But fellow economist Mark Hampton cautioned that the secrecy
that makes offshore finance centers viable is coming increasingly
under question by international institutions and larger states.
	   ``I'm saying that the world has changed drastically, even in the
past three years. Small islands would be ill-advised to rely on
OFCs for their entire economies,'' he told a workshop on islanders
and political economy.
	   The ISISA, which has no governmental or official affiliation,
has about 100 dues-paying members but no physical headquarters. It
was formed after another small islands conference in Okinawa in
1994. Previous informal conferences on small islands have been held
in Victoria, British Columbia in 1984, Tasmania in 1988 and Nassau,
Bahamas in 1992.

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended the week generally
lower Friday, with the key index in Hong Kong tumbling 2.6 percent
because of disappointment over Japan's latest plan to clean up its
financial sector. The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key
indicator of blue chips, fell 226.85 points, or 2.6 percent, to
close at 8,639.31. Brokers said share prices opened sharply lower
because investors considered Japan's ``bridge banks'' plan to clean
up the banking system as insufficient. In Tokyo, the key index
closed higher for the eighth straight day, after the prime minister
voiced support for tax cuts. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
climbed 39.66 points, or 0.24 percent, to close at 16,511.24. In
currency trading, the U.S. dlr was quoted at 139.24 yen in late
trading, up 0.06 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but well below its
late New York rate of 140.95 yen overnight. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Upset over back wages that are months overdue,
Russian coal miners on Friday blocked the Trans-Siberian rai*st trains but
allowed passenger trains through. The miners say the federal
government has paid only two-thirds of a 1 billion ruble (dlrs 160
million) sum that was promised after miners blocked the rails for
two weeks in May. Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said the
government has paid all the back wages it owes, a figure he put at
200 million rubles (dlrs 32.8 million). He said coal companies owe
miners a much larger sum _ 8.6 billion rubles (dlrs 1.4 billion).
(RUSSIA-STRIKES)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A day after announcing a long-awaited plan for
dealing with Japan's banking crisis, leaders signaled their
readiness Friday to follow up with a permanent tax cut to jump
start the country's moribund economy. Such a move would both take
advantage of momentum generated by the new ``bridge bank''
financial stabilization plan and answer calls from the United
States and other trading partners for bolder stimulus measures.
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, speaking at a campaign rally
ahead of parliamentary elections on July 12, indicated for the
first time his support for permanent tax relief instead of the
current policy favoring one-time tax breaks. Hashimoto's remarks
were echoed by Kan Kato, the head of an influential government tax
research panel, who called for tax cuts now that the ``bridge
bank'' system has been formally adopted. (JAPAN-ECONOMY)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The injection of government money
into stalled development projects may prevent layoffs of workers in
the hard-hit construction sector, a Malaysian official said Friday.
Public Works Minister Samy Vellu said the new funds would be used
to restart a coastal highway project, abandoned road schemes in
Kuala Lumpur and a 500 million ringgit (dlrs 125 million) national
sewerage system, the domestic news agency, Bernama, reported. An
average of 1,600 people were being laid off each week, according to
government statistics quoted by Friday's Business Times daily. Of
those sacked, 42.8 percent were from the manufacturing industry, 32
percent from construction and the remaining from other trades.
Since January, 39,155 people have lost their jobs. Of them, 89
percent or 34,843, were Malaysian, the daily said. Malaysia employs
numerous foreign workers. (MALAYSIA-ECONOMY)
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank said Friday
that a joint public and private sector committee has started
working on the restructuring of tens of billions of dollars in
domestic bad debt. Restructuring bad debt held by banks and finance
companies is considered a crucial step for Thailand, a year into
the Asian economic crisis, to emerge from its worst recession in
decades. Tarisa Watanagase, director of the Bank of Thailand's
department for regulation of financial institutions, said that
under guidelines in a new bankruptcy law, restructuring plans for
18 cases should be ready in 110 days. (THAILAND-BAD DEBT)

Yeltsin says tax payments needed to break `vicious cycle'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin said Friday that Russia's
largest company must help break the ``vicious cycle'' of
non-payments and hand over hundreds of millions of dollars in back
taxes it owes the federal government.
	   Yeltsin's comments came a day after the government touched off a
controversy by threatening to seize assets from Gazprom if the huge
gas monopoly didn't pay its overdue taxes.
	   The government's inability to collect taxes is one of its most
enduring problems, and the decision to target Gazprom has set up a
showdown between the government and what is perhaps the country's
most powerful company.
	   But Gazprom has complained that it often gets paid months late,
if at all, by its customers, which include many government
entities. As a result, it has difficulty paying its taxes on time.
	   All companies ``must pay fully, irrespective of what is paid to
them,'' Yeltsin said in a meeting with Gazprom head Rem Vyakhirev,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``Otherwise, we get a
vicious cycle.''
	   The Russian president and Vyakhirev had ``a rather hard
conversation, but as a result they have reached the decisions
necessary for the development of Gazprom and the Russian economy as
a whole,'' Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhemsky said.
	   Vyakhirev, who was on a business trip to Vienna, rushed back to
Moscow on Friday morning to meet with Yeltsin. Afterward, he still
seemed less than pleased, calling the controversy ``a
provocation.''
	   ``I believe that someone has done wrong in this case,''
Vyakhirev said.
	   Many opposition lawmakers seemed to agree with the Gazprom
chief. Many Communists immediately objected to government's
threats, denouncing the move as an effort to destroy one of the
country's remaining economic treasures.
	   Kiriyenko is in charge of digging Russia out of its financial
crisis, and he has focused on the government's chronic inability to
collect taxes. Tax debtors include the country's largest companies,
as well as millions of workers.
	   The government is seeking a new loan of at least dlrs 10 billion
from the International Monetary Fund to shore up the Central Bank's
reserves to prevent a run on the ruble, but the IMF is imposing
stiff conditions, including better tax collection and reform of
Gazprom and other huge monopolies.
	   Gazprom, which has close to 400,000 employees, controls
production and distribution of Russia's vast natural gas supplies,
and is one of Western Europe's largest suppliers. The IMF wants
Gazprom to reform gas prices to include transportation costs and
loosen its monopoly by allowing competitors access to its
pipelines.

Cambodia's Hun Sen says he's no monster; opponent disagrees

	   ROLANG KEN, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen depicted
himself as a sentimental songwriter Friday, while one of his chief
opponents in the July 26 parliamentary elections branded him a
murderer.
	   The conflicting portrayals follow accusations that Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party is using fear and violence, including the
slayings of political opponents, to ensure victory in the polls.
	   Hun Sen presented his softer side Friday in remarks villagers at
Rolang Ken, 25 kilometers (15 miles) west of the capital, Phnom
Penh.
	   Hun Sen said that he has composed more than 100 songs, many
about love and his difficult peasant childhood, that sometimes make
him weep.
	   ``It is a big misunderstanding to call Hun Sen a monster,'' Hun
Sen said. ``I never call myself a strongman. Strongman is what
other people call me, and neither am I a stubborn man.''
	   But leading dissident Sam Rainsy, campaigning before 1,500
people in the southwestern province of Pursat, accused Hun Sen of
ordering a grenade attack last year against a peaceful protest that
killed at least 16 people and injuring more than 100.
	   Sam Rainsy, one of Hun Sen's most vocal critics, was slightly
injured and was presumed to be the target.
	   ``Hun Sen is the one who ordered the grenades to be thrown,''
Sam Rainsy said. ``He is a brutal person. By wanting to kill just
Sam Rainsy, he was not afraid to have grenades thrown at innocent
people.''
	   On Wednesday, six gift-wrapped parcels containing explosives
were reportedly delivered to a provincial rally of the Sam Rainsy
Party. Party officials accused Hun Sen's organization of
intimidation.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party issued a statement urging the armed forces,
which are mostly in Hun Sen's camp, to stay neutral in the upcoming
contest, to let voters cast their ballot freely, and to support the
election result.
	   Hun Sen took nearly full control of Cambodia a year ago by
deposing Prince Norodom Ranariddh, with whom he served a tense
co-premiership after U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993.
	   The U.S. Embassy warned U.S. citizens Friday to take special
precautions during the anniversary July 5-7 of the bloody street
battles and looting that accompanied Ranariddh's ouster.
	   The embassy said Americans ``should avoid political gatherings
or demonstrations, avoid the vicinity of political party or
military buildings or compounds and exercise caution in crowds of
any sort.''
	   The prince returned from exile in March and, with Sam Rainsy, is
considered one of Hun Sen's chief challenger.
	   About 100 of the prince's supporters were killed in the months
after the coup. A U.N. human-rights report Wednesday said that four
apparently political killings rank among 140 reported cases of
violence and intimidation investigated since mid-May.
	   Hun Sen has called the elections to win back international aid
and legitimacy, but critics say he has stacked the process in his
favor.
	   At the historic Angkor temple area in northern Cambodia, a hotel
has refused to rent its four white elephants to a small party that
has a white elephant symbol, fearing the beasts might be attacked
in a political dispute.

Assad retires army chief-of-staff, sacks intelligence chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associate Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Syrian President Hafez Assad has ordered his
army chief-of-staff to retire and has sacked his intelligence
chief, Syrian sources said Friday.
	   Gen. Hikmat Al-Shihabi, the army chief-of-staff and a top
negotiator in peace talks with Israel, was replaced by Gen. Ali
Aslan, al-Shihabi's deputy and a veteran member of the ruling Baath
Party, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Assad signed the decree naming Aslan as the new army chief on
Wednesday.
	   The sources, contacted by telephone in Damascus, gave no reason
as to why Assad replaced al-Shihabi, who is 67.
	   The London-based Al-Hayat newspaper said al-Shihabi, a senior
member of the Baath Party and a close associate to Assad, is
expected to be named to a key civilian post.
	   Al-Shihabi was one of the few Sunni Muslim officers who joined
Assad in the 1970 coup that brought him to power. Assad is a member
of the minority Alawite sect, as is Aslan.
	   Assad also sacked Maj. Gen. Bashir al-Najar, his intelligence
chief.
	   Al-Najar was accused of ``harming the image of the regime
through wrongdoing and felonies,'' the sources said, quoting
another decree by Assad.
	   It gave no further details.
	   Al-Hayat said al-Najar was accused of illicitly videotaping
three ministers at a house of a famous Syrian belly dancer.
	   It is not clear if al-Najar, an army officer and former head of
the customs department, will retain a government post.
	   Syrian opposition leaders in Europe said al-Najar's dismissal
may have been a response to complaints of corruption and misuse of
power by intelligence officers.
	   Under Assad, Syria has followed a radical, socialist path to
development that has often put it at odds with other Arab states.
	   Israel and Syria have fought three major wars since the 1948
establishment of the Jewish state.

At end of China trip, Clinton meets pro-democracy leader Lee
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: TOPS with 7 grafs of Clinton comment on dissidents, picks up
3rd graf pvs, The door ...  &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-China-Clinton  &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ After avoiding public appearances with Chinese
dissidents throughout his trip, President Bill Clinton sought to
assure them Friday he would press China's communist government to
set all imprisoned dissidents free. ``The United States is on your
side,'' he said.
	   Clinton's remarks came a few hours after he met with
pro-democracy lawmaker Martin Lee, who said he wants Clinton's
visit to yield ``concrete results'' on political reform in China.
	   During a news conference at the close of his nine-day China
visit, Clinton defended his decision not to meet with dissidents,
saying he felt he could be more effective in the long term if he
raised human rights concerns directly with the government,
``starting with the president.''
	   He said he believed his public exchange over human rights with
President Jiang Zemin was a big step toward accomplishing that
goal.
	   ``I believe over the long run what you want is a change in the
policy and the attitude of the Chinese government ... not just on
this, that or the other specific, imprisoned dissident or
threatened dissident,'' Clinton said. ``... We believe that this
new, heretofore unprecedented, open debate about this matter will
lead to advances.''
	   When asked what message he would send to Chinese dissidents,
Clinton said, ``My message is that the United States is on your
side, and we did our best.''
	   To show support for politicians and democratic reformers in Hong
Kong, Clinton met with Lee, the leader of Hong Kong's Democratic
Party, and several others among the 20 legislators who won recent
elections. Lee said Clinton's trip has been successful in launching
a new openness in China, but he wants to see solid steps toward
reform both in Hong Kong and on the mainland.
	   ``The door in China has been opened a bit,'' Lee said. ``We in
Hong Kong want to see the door open wider. ... We hope to see
concrete results of Mr. Clinton's visit _ a faster pace of reform
in terms of human rights, the rule of law and democracy.''
	   Clinton and Lee, who last met in April 1997 in Washington,
talked for about 20 minutes. After that session, Clinton met with
some of Hong Kong's elected leaders, who said he spent most of the
time simply listening to them.
	   The group included Democrats and other pro-democracy politicians
recently voted into the legislature in the first elections since
the territory returned to Chinese rule a year ago. Only a third of
the legislature was elected by direct popular vote.
	   Those meeting with Clinton included both critics and backers of
Beijing who won election by popular vote in the May 24 election.
	   Lee's Democrats won 13 of 60 seats in the legislature, which
convened for the first time on Thursday. Despite election rules
guaranteeing that a pro-Beijing elite would dominate, the Democrats
and their allies control a third of the assembly.
	   They have little real power, but claim the moral authority to
push for a faster transition to full democracy.
	   Lee and other Democrats say Hong Kong's 6.5 million people have
retained most of their freedoms since China regained sovereignty.
However, the powerful Hong Kong economy has been dragged into
recession by Asia's economic woes.
	   Lee said he told Clinton that ``if Hong Kong can keep basic
values of freedom and democracy, it would be a tremendous help to
(the) entire region.''
	   ``I noted that you cannot separate economic and political
freedom and expect economic prosperity to last,'' Lee said. ``Rule
of law, a level playing field, a government that is open,
accountable, and responsive ... all these cannot last long without
a strong democratic base.''
	   Chinese leaders should look at the Hong Kong example ``and see
that there is nothing to fear from democratic elections or indeed,
democratically elected leaders,'' Lee said. ``Democracy works well
in a Chinese community, under Chinese rule.''
	   Populist Emily Lau of the Frontier movement said she told
Clinton that the full legislature and Hong Kong's chief executive
must be directly elected.
	   Tsang Yok-sing, chairman of the pro-China Democratic Alliance
for the Betterment of Hong Kong, called the meeting ``a clear
breakthrough,'' and said it had ``good implications for Hong
Kong.''

Tanzania deports three American missionaries blamed with sabotage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ The Tanzanian government deported
three American missionaries it accused of sabotaging the country's
natural resources by illegal hunting, state-run radio said Friday.
	   The report identified the three men, who work with the
missionary organization World Mission Gospel Aid in Tabora, central
Tanzania, as mission director Bruce Fivecoat, Jonathan Mayo and
Philip Knight.
	   Tabora Regional Commissioner Stephen Mashinga issued a statement
saying the Americans were deported in late May for hunting in a
restricted area, illegally possessing wildlife remains, and for
lending hunting licenses and a rifle to others illegally, the
report said.
	   He said the acts of the three Americans had deprived the
government of revenue by contributing to poaching activities in the
Tabora region.
	   According the statement, Fivecoat had illegally lent his gun to
another person; Mayo and Knight illegally lent their hunting
licences to unauthorized persons; and Knight was also found in
possession of hunting spoils which, if acquired without the proper
hunting authorization, are considered government property.
	   The report did not indicate where the three Americans were from
or where the government sent them following deportation.
	   American officials were unavailable for comment Friday, due to
the July 4 weekend holiday.

French govt limits Boeing 777 range, Air France delays 777 orders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French aviation authorities have decided to cut
from three hours to two, the amount of time the twin-engine Boeing
777 requires to reach an airport in an emergency, a spokesman said
Friday.
	   The decision made Thursday by the Direction Generale de
l'Aviation Civile (DGAC) followed an engine problem this week
aboard an Air France Boeing 777 on a flight from Sao Paulo to
Paris.
	   The decision came two days after Air France, which owns three of
the planes, delayed an order for two more. It also came at a
crucial time when U.S.-based Boeing is competing with French-based
Airbus for a contract with British Airways for shorter-run models.
	   The DGAC said it notified Boeing it was temporarily cutting
emergency landing range from 180 minutes to 120 minutes, pending an
investigation, said a DGAC spokesman, speaking on customary
anonymity.
	   The action was taken because of an engine problem, said the
spokesman, without elaborating.
	   The decision would primarily concern long-range Pacific routes.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Seattle-based Boeing Co.
	   State-owned Air France, at a Wednesday board meeting to decide
on options for two more 777s, delayed the decision for a year, said
airline spokeswoman Fabienne de Brebisson.
	   A day earlier, an Air France Boeing 777 with an engine problem
was forced to land in Tenerife on Flight 443 from Sao Paulo to
Paris, said de Brebisson, confirming a French media report.
	   ``It was an oil problem, so they stopped the engine and flew to
Tenerife with no difficulty,'' said de Brebisson.
	   She insisted the delay in Air France's 777 order was for
economic reasons and ``has nothing to do'' with the DGAC limit on
the plane or the engine incident.
	   She cited the Asian economic crisis and last month's pilots'
strike cost Air France 1.5 billion francs (dlrs 250 million). The
company had said the strike ``would have an impact on investment,''
she said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian border guards have detained a North Korean
fishing boat they found in Russian waters, a news agency reported

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ President Bill Clinton compared this week's
torching of Catholic and Protestant churches in Northern Ireland to
church burnings in the southern United States, saying Friday he
felt ``personally horrible about what has happened.''
	   Rival arsonists struck two Protestant church buildings and a
Catholic school Friday , just days after 10 Catholic churches were
burned, three of them gutted.
	   ``Obviously, I feel personally horrible about what has happened
to the churches.'' Clinton said at a news conference closing out
his nine-day tour of China. ``In our country, we had this round of
church burnings, you know, in the last few years.''
	   ``During the civil rights days, we had a number of bombings of
black churches, which really reflected the darkest impulses of some
of our people at their worst moments. And I would just plead to
whoever was responsible for this for whatever reason, you need to
take the churches off the list and you need to take violence off
the list,'' he said.
	   Earlier in the trip, Clinton talked by telephone with Northern
Ireland Protestant and Catholic leaders to congratulate them on
their election to head the province's new 108-member Assembly. .
	   Clinton, while touring China, talked with David Trimble of the
Ulster Unionist Party and John Hume, Social Democratic and Labor
Party leader whose deputy, Seamus Mallon, will share power with
Trimble in the Assembly.
	   ``I wanted to talk to them about what the United States could do
to continue to support this process,'' Clinton said.

Deadly heat wave, smog sweep Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Temperatures soared to 42 degrees Celsius
(108 degrees F) Friday and pollution passed danger levels in a
relentless heat wave that has killed at least four people and
hospitalized hundreds of people.
	   Hospitals were on alert and health officials told people to stay
inside in Athens because of the combination of heat and smog, which
has settled over the mountain-ringed basin in the sultry
conditions.
	   Hundreds of people went to hospitals suffering from heat stroke
and exhaustion. At least four deaths were blamed on the weather,
including a 3-year-old boy who died of heat stroke in the
southwestern port of Patras and an illegal Albanian immigrant who
collapsed crossing the border.
	   Temperatures are expected to fall a bit after Saturday. State
beaches and air conditioned spaces remained open to the public.
	   Electricity consumption reached record levels in Athens.
Officials cut power for one-hour intervals to prevent another
blackout. On Tuesday, power was cut to half of Athens for four
hours.
	   Minor wildfires flared in several regions around the country.
	   A heat wave in 1987 was blamed for more than 900 deaths around
Greece.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Incoming Philippine President Joseph
Estrada assured U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday that his
administration will work to strengthen relations between the two
countries.
	   Estrada sent Clinton a letter on the occasion of the 222nd
anniversary of U.S. independence on July 4, which is also the
anniversary of the Philippines' independence from U.S. rule in
1946.
	   ``My administration will ... work with the American government
towards a future of peace and prosperity for both our countries,''
Estrada wrote.
	   The greeting was apparently designed to rest speculation that
Estrada is anti-American. He was one of 12 Philippine senators who
voted against extending the lease on U.S. military bases in 1991,
forcing the last American troops to leave the country the following
year.
	   In the letter Estrada said the leadership and dynamism of the
United States in today's world is undeniable.
	   ``You are justifiably proud to be the leader of a progressive
nation that has been in the forefront of peace initiatives around
the globe when others lack the will to act or are unwilling to
commit their resources,'' Estrada said.
	   In a related-development, a Philippine anti-nuclear group urged
Washington to apologize for atrocities committed by U.S. forces
against Filipinos during the Philippine-American war at the turn of
the century.
	   ``It is high time that the Filipino people sought an official
act of atonement,'' said the Nuclear-Free Philippines Coalition in
a statement.
	   The coalition also asked the Philippine government to clear the
records of Filipino freedom fighters who were tried and found
guilty as common criminals during that time.
	   Philippine historians estimate that more than 300,000 Filipinos
were killed when the Americans seized the Philippines and made it a
colony after Filipinos revolted against Spanish colonizers.
	   The Philippines celebrated its centennial anniversary of the
declaration of independence from Spain on June 12.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ This city resounds almost nightly with
horn-honking cheers during the World Cup, no matter if the soccer
victors are from Germany or Brazil, Nigeria or Croatia.
	   That's because Frankfurt defies the image of German homogeneity:
About a third of the 600,000 residents hold foreign passports.
Bankers, store clerks and refugees from around the world make their
home in this compact financial capital on the Main River.
	   But Frankfurt lacks the established ethnic quarters and street
parades of bigger metropolises. So, the World Cup gives Frankfurt's
foreigners a chance to show their colors _ with vigor.
	   Soccer's biggest prize is being contested in neighboring France,
and Germans are all agog because their national team is also in the
running.
	   Not long after Croatia's 1-0 win Tuesday over Romania, convoys
of cars decked with Croatia's red-white-and-blue flag snaked
through downtown in what locals have come to call a ``Hupkonzert,''
or ``honking concert.''
	   Bartender Vlad Milanovic slapped high-fives on fellow Croats
hanging out of car windows with streamers and megaphones in front
of a Croat-run cafe on Frankfurt's main shopping avenue, the Zeil.
	   Many Croats in Frankfurt are refugees from the Bosnian war and
don't feel comfortable enough in their new land to show their
ethnicity too overtly, Milanovic said, because Germans sometimes
link them with crime.
	   ``But tonight it's a celebration,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter
what country you're in.''
	   Less than a soccer field's length away, British expatriates
huddled near a pub's TV set for the England-Argentina match.
	   ``We're showing our support here,'' said computer programmer
Graham Harrington. ``But you won't hear us out on the street
honking later if we win.''
	   ``Because we'll be too drunk to drive,'' added his friend, James
Stoker, a shiatsu masseuse.
	   There was to be no celebration anyway for the English, who lost
to their former Falklands War enemy in a 4-3 penalty shootout
following a 2-2 draw.
	   Frankfurt has the highest percentage of foreigners of any German
city, not even counting naturalized citizens or ethnic Germans born
elsewhere, such as the former Soviet Union, who have resettled here
in recent years. The main foreign groups are Turks, Croats and
Italians, but there also are populations of Asians, Africans, Latin
Americans.
	   Aside from banking positions, foreigners have been attracted to
the city's central European location and entry-level, blue-collar
jobs in services and construction.
	   In Frankfurt, rapidly becoming Europe's financial headquarters
as the seat of the European Central Bank, ethnic groups mix mostly
peacefully and Frankfurters are relatively tolerant of foreigners.
That is in contrast to some German cities, especially in the former
communist East, where foreign group sometimes target each other or
are attacked by young neo-Nazi thugs.
	   The city's neighborhoods are not differentiated; side by side
are Indian-run electronics shops, Asian supermarkets, Italian ice
cream parlors.
	   On soccer nights, euphoric shouts from fans in one apartment or
cafe are often answered minutes later by shouts from fans of the
opposing team down the street.

Senior Japanese economist foresees hesitant recovery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in graf 2 that Nomura is formerly with Economic
Planning Agency &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A senior Japanese economist warned Friday that
his country's economic recovery will be a slow and hesitant process
lasting another two to three years.
	   ``Perhaps in the latter half of this fiscal year, we will have
some signs of a turnaround,'' Makoto Nomura, a former deputy
director-general at Japan's Economic Planning Agency, told a forum
in Singapore on the Asian crisis. Nomura is now chief economist at
Sumitomo-Life Research Institute.
	   But he cautioned that the recovery will be ``very hesitant''
over the medium to longer term because the process of ongoing
structural reforms will cause some hardship, while consumer and
investor confidence will only return slowly.
	   Nomura was optimistic that current government measures to pull
Japan out of its recession would eventually lead to renewed growth,
though only after a period of ``two to three years'' of faltering
recovery.
	   On Thursday, Japan announced a ``bridge bank'' plan to help
resurrect the country's increasingly insolvent financial sector, in
addition to a stimulus package worth 30 trillion yen (dlrs 215
billion) unveiled earlier this year.
	   Nomura added that ``sustainable recovery cannot be achieved''
without such structural reform, but warned that other factors will
play a part in any return to growth.
	   Both he and Susumu Taketomi, a member of the Bank of Japan's
policy board who also spoke at the forum, stressed the importance
of renewing consumer demand and investor confidence as crucial to
any likely recovery.
	   Pointing to an inflexible supply-side in Japan's economy, Nomura
argued that producers and the service sector have been too
conservative.
	   For example, he noted that Japan's elderly own more than half
the country's total of about dlrs 8.6 trillion in savings, but
there are few products and services to specifically attract their
money.
	   Throughout the economy, ``stagnation of demand is the most
prominent problem,'' he said.
	   Confirming this view, Taketomi said that the government should
give top priority to ``measures which specifically aim at removing
the sources of apprehension'' both for consumers and within the
markets in Japan.

	   KFAR DAROM, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinians lifted their blockade
of Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip on Friday, ending a 12-hour
standoff in which Israeli and Palestinian troops had scuffled,
screamed accusations and pointed guns at one another.
	   It was the most serious confrontation between the two sides in
two years, with Israeli troops bringing in armored personnel
carriers and the Palestinians blocking roads with truck convoys.
	   After all-night negotiations involving U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis
Ross, a compromise on the point of dispute _ the use of a road _
was reached just before dawn.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested that the incident
could make Israel even more reluctant to hand over 13 percent of
the West Bank, as proposed by the United States. Israeli hardliners
claim that a troop pullback would leave more than a dozen
settlements isolated and at the mercy of the Palestinians.
	   Addressing foreign ambassadors Friday, Netanyahu said: ``You
could also understand how sensitive we are to the issue of
redeployment which could place tens of thousands of Israelis ... at
great peril any time the Palestinians decide to violate the
agreement, as they did last night.''
	   Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of having staged a deliberate
provocation, and said Israel would not succumb to threats of
violence.
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, dismissed
Netanyahu's accusation, saying the Palestinian Authority had made
every possible effort to defuse the situation.
	   ``He (Netanyahu) is the on to be blamed for the tense situation
on the ground'' because he has refused to live up to Israel's
promises, including a troop pullback, Erekat said.
	   The Gaza confrontation began with a seemingly routine argument
over the use of a road. About two-thirds of the Gaza Strip is
controlled by the Palestinian Authority, but Israeli troops patrol
near Jewish settlements and control several access roads.
	   On Thursday afternoon, Palestinian Supplies Minister Abdel Azziz
Shaheen demanded that Israel allow a convoy of 22 Palestinian cars
to use a coastal route it controls.
	   Israeli soldiers allowed Shaheen to use the road because as a
Cabinet minister he has special privileges, but asked the other
motorists to turn back. Shaheen insisted that all cars be allowed
to pass.
	   Palestinian police rushed to the scene and a confrontation with
Israeli troops quickly ensued. The two sides angrily pushed each
other and pointed their weapons at one another.
	   At Kfar Darom junction, near the Jewish settlement of the same
name, Israeli troops stationed three APCs in the middle of a road
linking two major Gaza Strip cities. Hundreds of vehicles were
brought to a standstill for hours.
	   In retaliation, Palestinian police ordered dozens of trucks to
block access roads to Jewish settlements. Israel, in turn, sealed
off the Gaza Strip.
	   As the standoff dragged on, army bulldozers hauled in sand to
set-up extra military positions along the road, and Palestinian
police crouched in the fields just a few dozen meters away.
	   Under a compromise reached early Friday, the Palestinians agreed
to move the trucks from the settlement roads while Israel allowed
Shaheen and his convoy to drive along the coastal road.
	   There has been sporadic friction between Israeli soldiers and
Palestinian police in recent months. However, the latest
confrontation was the most serious since September 1996, when
scores of people were killed in gunbattles between Israeli and
Palestinian troops.

Report: 21 prominent Islamic militants in Palestinian security
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Twenty-one prominent Islamic militants,
including six involved in the planning of suicide bombings in
Israel, have been recruited by the Palestinian police, a senior
Israeli official said Friday.
	   The information was contained in an intelligence report recently
submitted to the government, said Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan.
	   Palestinian security officials could not immediately be reached
for comment Friday.
	   Israel has long accused the Palestinian Authority of turning a
blind eye to Islamic militants and failing to prevent attacks on
Israel. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has countered that he is
doing the best he can to rein in the militants, but that he cannot
be expected to be successful all of the time.
	   However, Arafat's claim would be seriously undermined if it
turns out that 21 activists of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups
are serving in the Palestinian police force.
	   According to Israeli media reports, confirmed by Bar-Illan, six
of the 21 were involved in plotting three suicide bombings in the
spring of 1996 in which dozens of Israelis were killed.
	   Another three were aides to a top Hamas fugitive, Mohammed Deif,
the reports said. Also serving in the police force are four
militants who were sentenced by Palestinian Authority courts to
jail terms ranging from two to 12 years, but did not have to spend
time in prison.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Five Yugoslav army soldiers who ``refused
to kill women and children'' deserted in Kosovo and were escorted
into Albania on Friday, officials said.
	   The deserters were taken across the border Thursday night by two
fighters of their battlefield enemy, the Kosovo Liberation Army. At
the village of Vllahe, in the Has region, they were turned in to
Albanian police.
	   The soldiers were being taken Friday to the Albanian capital
Tirana, where they will stay at the mission of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe for an undetermined period,
according to the Interior Ministry.
	   ``As they have told our police in the north, they refused to
kill women and children,'' said an Interior Ministry official who
requested anonymity. ``That's why they have deserted.''
	   All five of the soldiers _ two from Montenegro and three from
Serbia _ have Muslim names. Ethnic Albanians also are predominantly
Muslim.
	   Several Yugoslav soldiers have deserted in recent weeks, and
increasing numbers of Serbian police have refused to serve in
largely Albanian Kosovo, where fighting has intensified this year
between Serb-led forces and ethnic Albanian militants.
	   Two other Yugoslav soldiers deserted and went into Albania last
week, telling OSCE officials in Tropoja they were escaping the
fighting in Kosovo.

Christie wins libel action
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Olympic and world 100-meter champion
Linford Christie won a libel suit Friday against a writer who
alleged the sprinter used performance-enhancing drugs.
	   A jury of six men and six women returned a verdict against
convicted armed robber turned author John McVicar following a
13-day High Court hearing in London.
	   The jury took less than five hours to decide that McVicar's
article ``How did Linford get this good?'', published in the
September 1995 issue of Spiked magazine, was libelous.
	   The 1992 Olympic gold medalist and 1995 world 100-meter champion
is also suing the printers and distributors of the now defunct
magazine.
	   The jury was scheduled to convene later Friday to consider
Christie's claims against the distributors and printers and the
amount of damages.

Clinton Wraps Up China Tour Saying China Could Be a Democracy
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By LAURA MYERS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ President Bill Clinton wrapped up his nine-day
tour of China Friday by urging Beijing leaders to ``ride the wave
of change and take China fully into the 21st century.'' Asked if he
feels democracy could come to the world's largest nation, he said,
``Oh, yes.''
	   ``I believe there can be (democracy in China) and I believe
there will be,'' Clinton said.
	   At a departing news conference, the president praised China for
a ``remarkable transformation'' and predicted it would lead to a
recognition that ``democracy also will be the right course
practically as well as morally.'' China has been ruled by
communists since 1949.
	   Speaking in the ballroom of a Hong Kong hotel, Clinton said the
``present government, headed by this president and this premier,
who are clearly committed to reform, (should) ride the wave of
change and take China fully into the 21st Century.''
	   Asked if he had a timeframe, Clinton said, ``That's like saying
... Do I believe a woman will be elected president of the United
States. I do. Do I think it will be a good thing? I do. Do I know
when it will happen? I don't.''
	   The news conference was Clinton's last event of his five-city
tour. He was returning to Washington for the Independence Day
holiday.
	   Clinton's summit meeting with President Jiang Zemin was the
highlight of the tour, culminating in a lengthy joint news
conference televised live to the Chinese people. He met too with
Premier Zhu Rongji.
	   Before leaving Hong Kong Friday, Clinton met privately with
pro-democracy leader Martin Lee and other Hong Kong legislators.
	   In his remarks to reporters, Clinton defended his decision not
to meet individually with dissidents, saying his direct engagement
of Chinese leaders could do more to ``advance the cause of human
rights.'' To the dissidents, Clinton said, ``The United States is
on your side and we did our best.''
	   ``Clearly, China is changing,'' Clinton said in an opening
statement. ``But there remain powerful forces resisting change,''
Clinton said, mentioning restrictions on free speech, assembly and
worship.
	   On other questions on other foreign affairs matters, Clinton:
	   _ Would ``not rule out any options'' on ways of ending the
bloodshed in Kosovo. He suggested the government of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic ``is primarily responsible'' for
ending the crackdown on ethnic Albanians. But, noting recent
victories by rebels, Clinton added, ``I think that others when
they're having a good day, or a good week on the military front,
may also be reluctant to engage in dialogue.
	   _ Expressed dismay at two nights of arson on churches and
schools in Northern Ireland and said he had talked to leaders
there. ``I feel personally horrible about what has happened to the
churches,'' Clinton said.
	   _ Was confident Japan would take the necessary steps to improve
its slumping economy. ``It is not rational to believe the Japanese
economy would contract further,'' he said.
	   Most of the session was devoted to his China trip and a policy
of engagement that has infuriated some in Congress who feel Clinton
should apply more pressure on Beijing to further human rights and
economic reforms. Clinton defended the policy while expressing
disappointment that no significant progress was made in loosening
Chinese trade restrictions.
	   ``I think they want to assume the responsibilities of opening
their markets and taking down barriers and allowing more
investment,'' he said.
	   Asked why he has not attempted to engage Cuba the way he has
China, Clinton said he would like to get ``some clear signal'' that
Cuba is interested in establishing a constructive relationship with
the United States, as China has.
	   Asked about accomplishments, Clinton said he and Chinese leaders
had ``reinforced our common commitment'' to regional security,
mentioning the Korean peninsula and the recent nuclear tensions
between India and Pakistan.
	   He also cited ``significant progress in nonproliferation,'' as
well as some headway on legal and environmental issues. He also
applauded an agreement to allow the Peace Corps in China.
	   On an issue with domestic political ramifications, Clinton said
Jiang had given him assurances that he ``did not order or
authorize'' nor could he find any one in the Chinese government who
had tried to buy influence in U.S. elections through U.S. campaign
donations.
	   ``I believe him,'' Clinton said. However, Clinton said Jiang
said he could not provide he same assurances about those in the
business sector, but that he did not know of any specific examples.

Chinese vice mayor convicted of corruption claims torture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese vice mayor convicted in a high-profile
corruption case claims investigators tortured him into falsely
confessing, Amnesty International human rights group reported
Friday.
	   The statement Vice Mayor Zhu Shengwen of northern Harbin city
gave court judges recanting his confession came in a case China's
Communist Party leaders had sought to publicize as proof they were
fighting corruption.
	   Rumors have circulated in Beijing political circles since winter
that Zhu startled trial judges in December by claiming he was
framed and accusing other Harbin city officials of corruption.
	   ``He stood up at the trial and said, `I was tortured. I'm not
guilty,''' said Arlette Laduguie, a China researcher at
London-based Amnesty International who has seen Zhu's 34-page
statement recanting his confession.
	   Zhu's outburst forced judges in Harbin to halt the trial so that
he could write the statement, Laduguie said. They convicted him in
April of pocketing more than 930,000 yuan (dlrs 112,000) in bribes
and income ``from unclear sources'' and sentenced him to life in
prison, according to Chinese press accounts.
	   Amnesty International said it could not verify Zhu's claims of
torture. Harbin's Intermediate People's Court convicted him without
any apparent investigation into the alleged police brutality.
	   During one interrogation session, Zhu claimed four people beat
him while he was bound to a chair, according to the statement which
Amnesty International said was obtained from a relative of the vice
mayor living abroad.
	   ``They took turns punching me in the abdomen while violently
twisting and lifting my arms from behind to such a height that the
wrenching pain made me almost faint,'' Zhu wrote in one excerpt
released by Amnesty International.
	   ``Because I was still locked to the chair, there was no way for
me to protect myself. All I could do was scream,'' the excerpt
said.
	   In another session, Zhu claimed he was shocked with electric
batons. While detained in a maximum security prison, two convicted
criminals ordered to watch him made him sit still in a chair from
morning to night. They punched and kicked him whenever he moved,
the rights group said.
	   China's state-run media has portrayed Zhu's case as a major
success in the Communist Party's four-year campaign to eliminate
rampant bribery, graft and misuse of public money by officials.
	   Corruption threatens to wear through the party's already
threadbare legitimacy with a public facing rising layoffs and
increasing government fees.
	   Unemployment has grown increasingly severe in cities like
Harbin, home to now rusting heavy industries that central planners
once favored. Over 300 people were questioned in connection with
Zhu's case and 21 of them have been sentenced, Amnesty
International said.
	   Zhu's wife, Fan Zhen, has been detained and, like Zhu, kept from
seeing her family since shortly after her husband's arrest in
October 1996. Amnesty International said she was put on trial last
month for not reporting Zhu's crimes.

World Cup: FA chairman wants Hoddle to stay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The chairman of the English Football Association
wants Glenn Hoddle to lead England into the next World Cup despite
the team's second-round exit from France '98.
	   Keith Wiseman was quoted in Friday's Sun newspaper as syaing
England was ``in safe hands'' with Hoddle as coach.
	   ``Glenn is only halfway through his current agreement and when
he wants a new one, we will talk,'' Wiseman said.
	   Wiseman said the reaction of English fans after the team's
penalty shootout defeat to Argentina showed how highly regarded
Hoddle was.
	   ``It reflected our mood and how we think of Glenn,'' he said. ``
The frustration is that we came back knowing we were so close.
	   ``It is terrible to have to wait another four years. I wish the
next World Cup was in two weeks time, because we are ready.''
	   Hoddle signed a four-year deal with the FA when he took over as
coach from Terry Venables in June 1996. The Sun revealed his
250,000 pound (dlrs 415,000) annual salary could be doubled in a
new agreement.

Ex-president friend questioned in Indonesian corruption inquiry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Prosecutors on Friday questioned one
of Indonesia's richest men _ and a former presidential golfing
buddy _ in an inquiry into allegations of corruption under
ex-President Suharto.
	   Officials from the Indonesian Attorney General's office Friday
said they interviewed former trade and industry minister Mohamad
``Bob'' Hasan over the collection of fees from members of a
billion-dollar plywood cartel he dominated until this year.
	   Indonesia is the world's largest plywood producer, churning out
10 million cubic meters (350 million cubic feet) annually.
	   The cartel has been dismantled as part of a dlrs 43 billion
International Monetary Fund economic bailout deal that calls for
sweeping reforms.
	   Attorney General public relations official Suhandoyo said Hasan,
also a former Cabinet minister, had promised to provide more
information to investigators.
	   ``We have just scratched the surface on the case,'' Suhandoyo
said.
	   Hasan, a member of Indonesia's ethnic Chinese minority, is long
time business associate of Suharto and owns several timber
companies.
	   Suharto quit as president in May, ending 32 years of
authoritarian rule, after a wave of protests and riots amid the
worst economic crisis is decades.
	   His successor and another old friend, President B.J. Habibie,
ordered an inquiry into the allegations of corruption, but has
cautioned that the inquiry must be conducted in line with
Indonesian law.
	   Critics of Suharto say the old leader's family and friends
amassed fortunes under his patronage.
	   Since Suharto's resignation, there has been a backlash against
companies associated with him and his family.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A retired general and leading parliamentary
opponent of President Boris Yeltsin was found dead at his country
residence Friday and his wife confessed to the killing, officials
said.
	   Lev Rokhlin, once head of parliament's defense committee, was
found in his bed with a gunshot wound to the head at his dacha near
Naro-Fominsk, 60 kilometers (40 miles) southwest of Moscow, said
Col. Gennady Melnik, spokesman for Moscow regional police.
	   Rokhlin's wife Tamara, 48, told police that she had a ``hostile
relationship'' with her husband and that she used his personal
handgun to shoot him about 4 a.m. as he lay sleeping, Melnik said.
	   Mrs. Rokhlin then notified one of the dacha's guards, who
alerted police. After her confession, she was arrested and taken
into custody, he said.
	   Police believe the killing was a domestic dispute unconnected to
Rokhlin's political work, Melnik said. The shooting followed a
Thursday night party to celebrate the birthday of the couple's
13-year-old son, but it was not clear if there was any connection
between the party and the shooting.
	   Rokhlin, 51, was a general who commanded Russian troops at the
beginning of the 1994-96 war in Chechnya. He was one of the few
Russian military figures to win high praise for his performance in
the conflict, which resulted in an embarrassing defeat for the
Russian forces.
	   After leaving the military, he won election to parliament in
1995 as a member of a faction that supported Yeltsin.
	   But Rokhlin grew disenchanted with Yeltsin's plans for military
reform, and he broke with the president, becoming a fierce critic.
	   Last year, Rokhlin launched the Movement in Support of the Army,
an anti-government organization that sought to ``dump the hated
regime'' of Yeltsin.
	   Rokhlin drew support among current and former Russian servicemen
who were upset by the military's decline in recent years. However,
the extent of Rokhlin's following remained unclear.
	   Yeltsin has been briefed about the killing, and ordered police
to conduct a full and open investigation, said presidential
spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
	   Rokhlin is the fifth member of parliament to be killed since
1994.

	   KITA-GUNMA, Japan (AP) _ Yukihiro Yamamoto shot his second
straight 6-under-par 65 Friday and took a one-stroke lead midway
through the 100 million yen (dlrs 719,000) PGA Philanthropy.
	   Yamamoto, a non-winner in 13 years as a pro, scored four
straight birdies, starting the 11th hole in a round of seven
birdies and a bogey over the 7,028-yard (6,395-meter), par-71
Shiromizu Golf Club course.
	   Shigeki Maruyama, who has yet to win this season, shot a 66 for
131.
	   Hiroyuki Fujita fired a 66 and was alone in third at 132.
	   Another stroke back at 133 were Australian Steve Conran,
Taiwan's Chen Tze-chung and three others.

Italian designers let men relax
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIELA PETROFF &QC; 
 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) - The latest round of Italian menswear puts
the stubble-faced creature of the night to bed and opts for a
casual look for Spring-Summer 1999. The operative word is comfort.
	   Leave it to Giorgio Armani to sum up the look. The designer
closed the five-day preview showings Thursday night with a
collection so relaxed there was little distinction between day and
night.
	   But he also leaped into the next millennium by departing from
his classic tailoring to show transparent pullovers and T-shirts.
	   Armani's lining-less jacket marked the birth of mens' designer
fashion twenty years ago. Armani said after the show that he felt
it was time to move on.
	   ``The man of 2000 has to be more daring,'' he said.
	   The latest Armani collection drew inspiration from the Orient,
with silk shirts and pants so soft they could be male palazzo
pajamas. His ``business'' suit too has the calming influence of
extra-light fabric and a generously cut unlined jacket matched with
loose uncuffed trousers.
	   Everywhere the styles also were fresh and sporty.
	   Next summer's suit has a classic jacket but the trouser is
low-waisted, loose and quite often of a different shade and fabric
from the jacket. Moschino had fun with this idea, making one side
of a suit in red and the other in vertical black and white stripes.
	   The shirt jacket or blouson replaces the traditional blazer.
	   The new relaxed pants draw inspiration from the worlds of work
and sports. At Dolce and Gabbana, cargo pants imitated the uniform
of the Milan garbage collector. At Calvin Klein the drawstring cuff
and elasticized waist were right out of the locker room.
	   Pullovers and T-shirts are loose and light. The classic shirt
almost disappears, replaced by a pristine short-sleeved version,
buttoned at the neck. Tops at this style were puritan Miuccia Prada
and her soul mate Jil Sander.
	   Armani was not the only designer to offer transparency.
See-through items showed up at Krizia, Gigli, Ferre, Gucci and even
Prada.
	   Krizia favored the latest safari color scheme of the season --
from white to cappuccino beige. These colors were also the favorite
at Fendi, whose classic man wears a tie and even a three-piece suit
but still looks cool and relaxed.
	   Best at the black end of the palette was Gianfranco Ferre, who
showed a turn of the 20th-century dandy in a charcoal gray silk
suit or a double breasted white and black denim suit. Very
contemporary were the black leather bathing trunks.
	   All the color this round was at Gucci's collection, designed by
Tom Ford.
	   ``Bored with black,'' as he himself has said, Ford decorated his
summer fashion with bright floral prints and glittering Las Vegas
neon shades.
	   In the accessory department the latest items are the wide-
banded sub watches even worn to the office over a cuff-linked shirt
at Gucci, and the flat, pouched money belt proposed by Prada.
	   The 1999 tie is so slim it is hardly worth wearing.
	   Footwear matches the relaxed spirit. Clogs, sandals, and
slip-ons popped up at every show. Where there were loafers and
lace-ups there were no socks -- proof that these collections are
all about casual comfort.

More World War II shells, bombs found in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Heavy rains have washed away dirt in recent
days and revealed dozens of unexploded artillery shells from World
War II, a news report said Friday.
	   Since the beginning of the week, 80 artillery shells with a
total weight of 4.5 tons (5 short tons) were found near the
southeastern coal-producing city of Pavlohrad, the Interfax news
agency reported Friday.
	   In the capital Kiev, 30 shells have been uncovered this week, it
said.
	   In the village of Ternova in the northeast, explosives experts
were guarding a 250-ton (275 short-ton) unexploded bomb, the report
added.
	   Ukraine was the site of heavy World War II battles between
Soviet and Nazi German troops, and such finds are not rare. The
Emergency Situations Ministry linked the recent finds to a spate to
floods and rainstorms last month, and to large-scale city repair
works in Kiev.

Vatican declares World War II cardinal a martyr
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Vatican declared Croatia's World War II
cardinal a martyr for the faith, paving the way for his
beatification during a visit by Pope John Paul II in October.
	   The pope signed the decree Friday for Cardinal Alojzije
Stepinac, who was a hero to Roman Catholic Croats for his
resistance to communism but was accused by Serbs of sympathizing
with the Nazis.
	   After the war, Stepinac was tried by Yugoslavia's communist
government and sentenced to jail for collaboration. He died while
under house arrest in 1962 in his hometown of Krasic, the basis of
the Vatican's finding that he died for his faith.
	   While serving as Zagreb's archbishop in 1941, he supported
Croatia's German-backed puppet government led by dictator Ante
Pavelic.
	   By 1942, however, Stepinac denounced the regime's genocidal
policies which led to the extermination of hundreds of thousands of
Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and Croat opponents. Stepinac's own notes and
recent studies say he spoke out against the atrocities and worked
to save lives, but many Serbs still consider him a war criminal.
	   Zagreb Archbishop Josip Bozanic announced in May that the
beatification would take place at an Oct. 3 Mass in Marija
Bistrica, a shrine outside of Zagreb. Beatification is the last
formal step before possible sainthood.
	   The pope plans a two-day visit to Croatia in October.

Ticket collector stabs passenger in Kiev tram
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A ticket collector stabbed and wounded a
passenger who argued with him on a tram in Kiev, newspapers
reported Friday.
	   The passenger, a 26-year-old man, underwent an operation for a
stomach wound and was in stable condition, the newspaper Kievskiye
Vedomosti said.
	   The daily Fakty quoted the victim, identified only as Petro M.,
as saying he was stabbed after pleading with a ticket inspector not
to fine a woman who had no ticket and no money.
	   The collector escaped after the attack and police were looking
for him, said Nina Rizon, an official with the company that runs
the tram service in the Ukrainian capital.
	   About 400 ticket collectors who include former soldiers, jobless
factory workers and even ex-convicts seeking rehabilitation are
working in Kiev's trolley buses and trams, Rizon said. Petty
criminals also are known to pose as inspectors and collect fines
from passengers without tickets.
	   ``We cannot say whether it was a real collector or a fake one,''
Rizon noted.
	   But the chief of ticket collectors service, Serhiy Lytvynov,
said he could not recall a single case in which a collector had
attacked a passenger, Fakty reported.
	   So far this year, passengers have stabbed and wounded two
inspectors, and four others were badly beaten and hospitalized, he
said.

Lebanon arrests 11 former Christian militiamen for bombings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH PANOSSIAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese security forces have arrested 11
former members of a right-wing Christian militia suspected of
involvement in a series of bombings aimed at destabilizing the
country.
	   A statement issued by security sources and carried by the
official media said the men were behind a 1996 attack against a
Syrian bus that killed its driver and an explosion at the main bus
terminal in downtown Beirut in October 1997 that caused no
casualties.
	   It said the men may also have been behind an attack that
targeted the U.S. Embassy, but left no casualties.
	   The statement did not say when the 11 were arrested.
	   It said, however, that two members of the group were killed in
Beirut on June 12 when a bomb that they were transporting exploded
prematurely.
	   The statement said that an investigation by the Lebanese army's
Intelligence Department revealed that among the 11 men were members
of a 20-member `shock troop'' cell of the former Lebanese Forces
militia that received orders via the internet from a militia office
in Australia.
	   A member of the Lebanese Forces political council in Australia
denied any involvement.
	   ``We have had nothing to do with this matter or any other
matters,'' Tony Chidiac told the Australian Associated Press in
Sydney.
	   The Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia during the
1975-90 civil war, was disbanded by the Syrian-backed government in
1994 and its leaders jailed.
	   During the war, the militia opposed Syrian influence and had
close ties to Israel. Syria maintains some 35,000 soldiers in
Lebanon and is the main power broker in the country.
	   The statement also said the group had planned to assassinate
three unnamed political and security officials.
	   The statement said the acts aimed to destabilize the country and
``the possibility that the perpetrators may have been acting on
instructions from Israeli intelligence agencies is not ruled out.''
	   Lebanese leaders repeatedly have accused Israel and its
supporters of seeking to destabilize Lebanon.
	   Last month, several Lebanese Forces members won seats in
municipal elections in Christian areas. It was their first
political participation after boycotting elections since the end of
the civil war.

President orders probe into attack on reporter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma ordered the
interior minister and prosecutor-general to personally oversee the
investigation into a recent attack against a journalist in western
Ukraine, Kuchma's office said Friday.
	   Oleksandr Syrtsov, correspondent for the Dyen daily in the
western city of Lviv, was badly beaten by two unknown attackers on
his way to work Monday.
	   In its report about the incident, Dyen claimed the attack may
have been linked to Syrtsov's work, adding that the attackers did
not take Syrtsov's money and other valuables.
	   However, Roman Onyshkevych of Dyen's Lviv bureau said
investigators have not yet confirmed this version. He said Syrtsov
is currently recovering at home and is going to return to work
shortly.
	   A number of other Ukrainian newspapers complained recently that
their journalists suffered assaults because of the stories they
wrote.

Unemployment drops in Germany for fourth straight month
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that 12.6 percent was reached in January; Adds
figures for east and west, additional quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German unemployment dropped in June to 10.5
percent, continuing a downward trend that the government said
Friday showed the country's ``impressive'' economic upswing was
gaining strength.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, fighting an uphill battle for a record
fifth term, had his spokesman release the figures four days ahead
of schedule.
	   According to spokesman Otto Hauser, 120,000 fewer Germans were
registered as unemployed in June, compared to the month before.
	   That put the rate in June at 10.5 percent, compared with 10.9
percent in May and 11.1 percent in June 1997.
	   In all, some 4.075 million Germans were unemployed in June,
Hauser said, adding that the figure should drop below the
psychologically significant 4 million mark by fall.
	   Unemployment, which hit a postwar high of 12.6 percent in
January, is the key issue in national elections Sept. 27, and Kohl
has been quick to cite the current decline as evidence that his
government is on the right track.
	   Hauser said Germany's economic recovery was gaining ``breadth
and dynamic'' and showed the government's reform course is taking
hold.
	   Unemployment has fallen by 750,000 since the 4.8 million
registered in January, a performance Hauser called ``impressive.''
	   ``We expect the positive trend to continue,'' he said.
	   In eastern Germany, still struggling with the transition to a
market economy, 70,000 fewer people registered as jobless in June
for a rate of 17.2 percent. In western Germany, 50,000 fewer people
registered as jobless, lowering the rate there to 8.9 percent, the
government said.

Mohamed Al Fayed lashes out at Princess Diana's brother over

museum &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed lashed out at
Princess Diana's brother Friday, calling it ``disgraceful'' that a
museum opened this week in honor of the late princess contained no
references to Fayed's son, Dodi.
	   Dodi Fayed, Diana's boyfriend at the time, was killed with the
princess Aug. 31 in a Paris car crash.
	   The museum was opened Wednesday by Diana's brother, Earl
Spencer, at Althorp, the family's ancestral home, where the
princess is buried on an ornamental island.
	   ``I am sure the people who visit Diana's grave will be amazed
there isn't a mention of Dodi's name and there are so many of
Prince Charles, who brought her so much unhappiness,'' Al Fayed
said. ``Earl Spencer just wants to get back at me.''
	   In a recent documentary aired by the BBC, Spencer dismissed
claims his sister was set to marry Dodi Fayed, saying their
relationship had not gone past the ``heady stage.'' He also
criticized Al Fayed for contending Diana uttered some last words in
Paris, calling the claim ``monstrous.''
	   Al Fayed said he questioned why Spencer was ``distancing himself
from the relationship between his sister and my son.''
	   ``He himself admitted in his speech on the day of her funeral
that she had finally found happiness in her private life,'' he
said.
	   A spokeswoman for Spencer said he would have no comment on Al
Fayed's remarks.

 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Five Yugoslav army soldiers who ``refused
to kill women and children'' deserted in Kosovo and were escorted
into Albania on Friday, officials said.
	   The deserters were taken across the border Thursday night by two
fighters of their battlefield enemy, the Kosovo Liberation Army. At
the village of Vllahe, in the Has region, they were turned in to
Albanian police.
	   The soldiers were being taken Friday to the Albanian capital
Tirana, where they will stay at the mission of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe for an undetermined period,
according to the Interior Ministry.
	   ``As they have told our police in the north, they refused to
kill women and children,'' said an Interior Ministry official who
requested anonymity. ``That's why they have deserted.''
	   All five of the soldiers _ two from Montenegro and three from
Serbia _ have Muslim names. Ethnic Albanians also are predominantly
Muslim.
	   Dozens of Yugoslav soldiers have deserted in recent weeks, and
increasing numbers of Serbian police have refused to serve in
largely Albanian Kosovo, where fighting has intensified this year
between Serb-led forces and ethnic Albanian militants.
	   Many of the army deserters and draft dodgers come from
Montenegro, larger Serbia's only remaining partner in the Yugoslav
Federation.
	   A Montenegro deputy parliament speaker, Rifat Rastoder, said
Friday that 105 Montenegrin conscripts on military duty in Kosovo
have deserted in the last two months _ half of them Muslims.

Yeltsin says tax payments needed to break `vicious cycle'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin giving Gazprom one day to develop payment
schedule, new graf 3, arrangement to write off mutual debts, amount
owed, in new grafs 8-10. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) - President Boris Yeltsin said Friday that Russia's
largest company must help break the ``vicious cycle'' of
non-payments and hand over hundreds of millions of dollars in back
taxes it owes the federal government.
	   Yeltsin's comments came a day after the government touched off a
controversy by threatening to seize assets from Gazprom if the huge
gas monopoly didn't pay its overdue taxes.
	   During a meeting Friday, Yeltsin gave Gazprom head Rem Vyakhirev
one day to present a detailed payment schedule, presidential
spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
	   The government's inability to collect taxes is one of its most
enduring problems, and the decision to target Gazprom has set up a
showdown between the government and what is perhaps the country's
most powerful company.
	   But Vyakhirev complained to Yeltsin that that Gazprom often gets
paid months late, if at all, by its customers, which include many
government entities. As a result, it has difficulty paying its
taxes on time.
	   All companies ``must pay fully, irrespective of what is paid to
them,'' Yeltsin told Vyakhirev, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency. ``Otherwise, we get a vicious cycle.''
	   The Russian president and Vyakhirev had ``a rather hard
conversation, but as a result they have reached the decisions ...
necessary for the development of Gazprom and the Russian economy as
a whole,'' Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
	   ``The president suggested that a complete solution to the
situation be worked out in one day,'' Yastrzhembsky added.
	   The government said Gazprom owes 4 billion rubles (about dlrs
750 million) in taxes each month, plus an unspecified sum in
outstanding tax debts. But the government appears to be willing to
write off at least some of the existing mutual debts.
	   Vyakhirev, who was on a business trip to Vienna, rushed back to
Moscow on Friday morning to meet with Yeltsin. Afterward, he still
seemed less than pleased, calling the controversy ``a
provocation.''
	   ``I believe that someone has done wrong in this case,''
Vyakhirev said.
	   Many opposition lawmakers seemed to agree with the Gazprom
chief. Many Communists immediately objected to government's
threats, denouncing the move as an effort to destroy one of the
country's remaining economic treasures.
	   Kiriyenko is in charge of digging Russia out of its financial
crisis, and he has focused on the government's chronic problems
with tax collection.
	   Gazprom, which has close to 400,000 employees, controls
production and distribution of Russia's vast natural gas supplies,
and is one of Western Europe's largest suppliers.

Polish parliament fails to overrule presidential veto
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Parliament's ruling Solidarity-led
coalition failed Friday to override the president's veto of
legislation to consolidate Poland's provinces and decentralize its
administration.
	   President Aleksander Kwasniewski vetoed the legislation Thursday
saying it contradicts the will of local communities. The bill would
consolidate Poland's 49 provinces into 15 new ones, and has drawn
protest from residents of cities that will lose their status as
provincial capitals.
	   Parliament's rightist-dominated lower chamber voted 247-190, 16
votes short of the required three-fifths majority to override the
veto.
	   Kwasniewski, an ex-communist, said he will not offer his own
plan to reorganize the provinces, but will ask the coalition and
the leftist opposition to agree on a new proposal.
	   The reform plan, which would do away with the communist-era
administration and take effect Jan. 1, would transfer more power to
local governments and is generally supported by most politicians.
But the government and the leftist opposition disagree over the
number of provinces.
	   The government, which maintains larger provinces would be more
efficient, has indicated it will return to its earlier plan of
creating 12 big provinces. The leftist opposition said it will
propose 17.

Kirsten 127 not out in South Africa's 300-2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Gary Kirsten scored two singles to
reach his seventh test century as South Africa dominated the third
cricket test against England at Old Trafford on Friday.
	   Kirsten, 98 not out overnight, was 127 not out as the Proteas
went to lunch at 300 for two on day two of the test.
	   Resuming the day on 237 for one, South Africa lost Jacques
Kallis for 132 but Kirsten and Daryll Cullinan (16 not out)
provided England with no further joy in the first session.
	   Kirsten's century was another landmark in the test.
	   It took the veteran opener just over six hours to score his
hundred after contributing to a new South African record second
wicket stand with Kallis.
	   The 263-run partnership was the fifth highest for South Africa
in test cricket.
	   Kallis' second test century included 16 boundaries and came off
266 balls. He added 16 more to his overnight 117.
	   Almost 24 hours after he had bowled opener Gehardus Liebenberg
for 16, medium paceman Darren Gough hit Kallis' off stump with an
unplayable delivery.
	   Gough's breakthrough ended the frustrating stand but he almost
captured the wicket of Callinan, who played and missed repeatedly.
	   Cullinan, who took 16 balls to get off the mark, has batted for
86 minutes and hit just one boundary off 74 balls.
	   Kirsten took 325 balls to reach his hundred and has so far
batted the entire duration of the innings.
	   It was Kirsten's first century in 14 innings since he scored an
unbeaten 108 in the third test against Australia at Adelaide in
February this year.

Volkswagen buys Rolls-Royce, but questions linger over trademark
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Volkswagen AG closed its purchase of Rolls-Royce
Motor Cars Ltd. on Friday _ but questions remained over whether the
German auto giant can use the luxury car's brand name and
trademark.
	   Volkwagen chairman Ferdinand Piech said he was ``delighted'' to
acquire the fabled auto company that epitomizes hand-made British
craftsmanship.
	   Volkswagen, Europe's biggest carmaker, paid 479 million pounds
(dlrs 780 million) to close the deal after beating out an offer
from rival BMW.
	   But Rolls-Royce PLC, a London-based jet engine maker, said
Friday it still controls the Rolls-Royce brand name and logo under
a deal struck when the two Rolls-Royce companies were separated in
the 1970s.
	   Volkswagen may have bought the Rolls-Royce factory in Crewe,
England, but it still has no deal to use the brand name, according
to Rolls-Royce PLC.
	   ``Volkswagen are aware of our rights to the name and
trademark,'' Rolls-Royce PLC spokesman Martin Brodie said. ``We've
not had any detailed discussions.''
	   Rolls-Royce PLC would not say whether it would try to block
Volkswagen's use of the name or whether it might try to force the
German company to pay for the right.
	   ``We attach the greatest importance to the preservation and
protection of the Rolls-Royce name and trademarks as key assets of
our business, and we'll take whatever action is necessary and
appropriate'' to ensure that Rolls-Royce PLC shareholders don't
lose out, Brodie said.
	   Volkswagen spokesman Kurt Rippholz declined to discuss the name
and trademark issue earlier in the week. No one at Volkswagen's
press office was available for immediate comment Friday afternoon,
according to a receptionist at Volkswagen headquarters in
Wolfsburg.
	   Vickers PLC, the British engineering group that sold
Rolls-Royce, has said the old deal giving Rolls-Royce PLC the right
to veto a foreign purchase of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars is
unenforceable under current European Union law.
	   Volkswagen clinched the purchase last month when Vickers
shareholders approved its bid of 430 million pounds (dlrs 710
million) over BMW's offer of 340 million pounds (dlrs 560 million).
	   The final price was higher. Both bidders had agreed to pay
Vickers a bit extra on closing to account for an increase in the
value of assets at Rolls-Royce since the first of the year.
	   ``This is a splendid outcome for all concerned,'' said Sir Colin
Chandler, the Vickers chairman. Chandler had come under sharp
attack from small shareholders who were outraged last month to see
their beloved Rolls-Royce cars being sold off to the Germans.
	   ``Vickers has secured excellent value for its shareholders from
the transaction and a strong and committed new owner can now take
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars forward to the next stage of its
development,'' Chandler said.
	   Volkswagen's Piech said he was ``committed to building this
business in a manner consistent with its character and heritage.''
	   Volkswagen and Vickers said they hoped soon to close a related
deal for Volkwagen to buy the Cosworth engine-making company.
	   Volkswagen will need the engines. After Vickers agreed to sell
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars to Volkswagen, BMW said it was terminating
an earlier deal to supply engines for some Rolls-Royce cars.
	   Rolls-Royce PLC had favored a sale to BMW, which is its partner
in an unrelated jet engine venture.

As Clinton visits Hong Kong, Taiwan again rejects Beijing's system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan on Friday stood by its rejection of
the ``one country, two systems'' framework applied by China in Hong
Kong and highlighted by U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to the
territory.
	   Taiwan is a ``sovereign independent nation that decides its own
fate,'' and is very different from Hong Kong, said Lin Chung-ping,
vice chairman of the Cabinet's Mainland Affairs Council.
	   China originally devised the ``one country, two systems''
blueprint as a formula for reuniting with Taiwan. Beijing considers
this island a breakaway province that must be brought back into the
fold.
	   Though the system is widely rejected here, some are concerned
that Clinton's presence in Hong Kong at the end of his tour of
China will be seen as a tacit endorsement that will pressure
Taiwan.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin also visited Hong Kong this week
for the first annivesary of its handover, and reiterated China's
view that the formula could be used in Taiwan.
	   Taiwan has watched Clinton's China visit nervously, and was
roiled by his reiteration of U.S. commitments to China in Shanghai
on Tuesday.
	   Though not expressing anything new in substance, his comments
marked the first time an American president has publicly stated
what is now called the ``three no's'' policy: no support for
Taiwan's independence, no recognition of a separate Taiwanese
government and no backing for Taiwan's membership in international
organizations such as the United Nations.
	   Taiwan considered Clinton's comments a concession to China, and
worry the position will reduce the island's bargaining power.
	   Clinton defended the statement at his news conference in Hong
Kong, saying he clarified U.S. policy to both sides.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Roy Wu said the bid for U.N.
membership will continue.
	   Taiwan's seat in the United Nations was turned over to China in
1971, and Taipei has tried without success to have the matter of
its status discussed in the General Assembly for the past four
years.
	   China and Taiwan split in 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalists fled the Communist takeover of the mainland. The
Nationalists officially advocate eventual reunification with China,
but not on Beijing's terms.

Briton held in stabbing death of Frenchman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GRENOBLE, France (AP) _ A 43-year-old English fan was to face a
judge Friday on suspicion of stabbing a Frenchman to death after
the England-Argentina World Cup match _ allegedly because he
thought the man was a rival fan mocking him.
	   The man, identified by police as an engineer from London who is
not a known soccer hooligan, allegedly stabbed actor Eric Frachet,
33, on the train from Lyon to Grenoble Tuesday night, following
England's defeat in the game in Saint-Etienne, near Lyon.
	   He was arrested Wednesday night in a Grenoble hotel, following a
dispute with the hotel's night guard. Police quickly linked him to
the stabbing.
	   According to police officials speaking on customary anonymity,
the man was sitting across from Frachet on the train and thought
that the smiling actor was an Argentinian fan mocking him.
	   The man does not appear on the list of known hooligans provided
by Scotland Yard, police said.

Solana says NATO keeping options open for Kosovo intervention

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Returning from a trip to the Balkans, NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said Friday that the Western
alliance was still preparing for military action if needed to stop
the fighting in Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   ``NATO is planning for all contingencies in case the
international community needs support,'' he said in Berlin, where
he was participating in a privately sponsored conference on
European solidarity.
	   Asked if the military option was becoming less likely, he said:
``We are prepared to help the diplomatic channel. After all, we
have to find a political solution.''
	   Solana said he had been in touch with U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke, who was to meet Friday with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic amid reports of new fighting in the province, which is
seeking independence.
	   Solana said the West was seeking three things in Kosovo: a
cease-fire, withdrawal of heavy weapons and a resumption of talks.
	   ``For that it'll be very important for the Kosovo (Albanian)
people to have one voice,'' he said, referring to fears that the
militant Kosovo Liberation Army was winning support away from
Ibrahim Rugova, the longtime pacifist political leader of Kosovo's
ethnic Albanian majority.
	   Solana said Rugova, whom he met on Wednesday, ``will have an
important role to play.'' Solana added that he had not been in
contact with the militants.
	   Asked if they should join the talks, he said, ``That's not for
me to decide.''

One Nation candidate sued for racial discrimination
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A Malaysian-born businessman Friday
said he has sued a candidate for Australia's right-wing populist
One Nation political party for racially discriminatory comments.
	   Chuck Hong said he had been discriminated against and racially
vilified by the comments of Les Sheather, the One Nation candidate
for federal parliament.
	   Hong is seeking U.S. dlrs 62,000 (Australian dollars 100,000)
and an apology after lodging a complaint against Sheather with the
Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission.
	   Hong, who said he has lived in Australia for 30 years, placed a
newspaper advertisement to protest the result of the Queensland
state election, in which One Nation won about 23 percent of the
vote.
	   The advertisement called for ``all self-respecting Asian
Australians'' to boycott products and services from Queensland and
to avoid studying, visiting or investing there.
	   Sheather was quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper three
days later as saying: ``I just wish we lived in the 40s. With such
people, you'd put them up against a wall and shoot them.''
	   Hong said the comments were a reaction to his advertisement,
that he took them literally and that he feared for his safety and
that of his family.
	   ``You never know what One Nation people can do,'' Hong told
reporters Friday. ``There are still mean and ugly people lurking in
the fringe of our civilized society shouting the discarded slogans
of fascism and embracing the eugenic ideology of Nazism.''
	   ``They are not tolerant to people who are of different color or
creed.''
	   Sheather said he had not met Hong and that he should not take
the comments personally.
	   ``There's no malice intended to any individual at all,'' he
said.

Briton held in stabbing death of Frenchman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GRENOBLE, France (AP) _ A 43-year-old English fan was to face a
judge Friday on suspicion of stabbing a Frenchman to death after
the England-Argentina World Cup match _ allegedly because he
thought the man was a rival fan mocking him.
	   The man, identified by police as an engineer from London who is
not a known soccer hooligan, allegedly stabbed actor Eric Frachet,
33, on the train from Lyon to Grenoble Tuesday night, following
England's defeat in the game in Saint-Etienne, near Lyon.
	   He was arrested Wednesday night in a Grenoble hotel, following a
dispute with the hotel's night guard. Police quickly linked him to
the stabbing.
	   According to police officials speaking on customary anonymity,
the man was sitting across from Frachet on the train and thought
that the smiling actor was an Argentinian fan mocking him.
	   The man does not appear on the list of known hooligans provided
by Scotland Yard, police said.

UN discussion paper raises possibility of East Timor autonomy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-East Timor

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A U.N. envoy has raised the
possibility of autonomy for East Timor within Indonesia as part of
a set of proposals meant to spur discussions over the troubled
territory's future.
	   Jamsheed Marker is chairing talks between Indonesia and East
Timor's former colonial master, Portugal.
	   In a copy of a five-page discussion paper obtained by The
Associated Press, Marker suggested the possibility of establishing
an ``East Timor regional administration'' that would assume many
internal powers in coordination with Indonesia.
	   Indonesia would maintain responsibility for foreign relations,
defense, the currency and finance.
	   In a list of other possibilities, Marker suggested the regional
administration would hold executive power within East Timor.
	   The half-island territory would have its own independent
judiciary and police force. It would also maintain cultural
autonomy over areas such as education and language.
	   With the agreement of the Indonesian government, East Timor
would also take part in some international activities and forums,
it said.
	   The document, which appears aimed a reaching a compromise
between calls for independence and Indonesian maintenence of
sovereignty, contains a wide range of possibilities and variations
on what form East Timorese autonomy might take.
	   Copies of the document have been marked ``strictly
confidential'' have been circulating in East Timor during the past
few days.
	   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas on Friday criticized the
leaking of the U.N. document and said it did not contain any peace
proposal but only discussion ideas as part of ongoing negotiations.
	   In the document itself, Marker said his ideas ``are intended to
serve as a basis for discussion and do not, as such, constitute a
formal proposal.''
	   Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed East Timor in 1976. Since
then, it has fought a small band of rebels and has been frequently
accused of human rights abuses.
	   In recent weeks East Timorese protesters have stepped up a
campaign for a vote on independence in the wake of the resignation
in May of President Suharto, who sent troops to invade the
territory 23 years ago.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, has pledged
democratic reform in Indonesia.
	   He has offered to grant special status to East Timor and to
release a jailed guerrilla commander in return for international
recognition of Indonesia's sovereignty over the territory. But he
has ruled out a referendum.
	   The U.N. document makes no mention of a referendum.

Pakistan demands probe by Canada, U.S. into alleged defector

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan on Friday urged both Canada
and the United States to investigate how a Pakistani man claiming
to be a nuclear scientist got visas ``when genuine applicants face
hardships getting visas to Western countries.''
	   Information Minister Mushahid Hussein, whose comments were
carried by the state-run news agency, also said that the Pakistan
government would conduct an investigation of its own.
	   Iftikhar Chaudhary Khan, who is currently in the United States
seeking asylum, claims to be a nuclear scientist who attended a
secret meeting where Pakistan mapped out plans to launch a
pre-emptive nuclear strike against its uneasy neighbor India.
	   However, the director of a private company that makes ceramic
tiles and bathroom fixtures said he was Khan's boss for four years
until November 1997, when Khan resigned.
	   According to Asad Gulzar Sheikh, director of Forte Trading
Company (Pvt) Limited, Khan was an assistant accountant who was
earning 5,000 rupees a month or the equivalent of dlrs 120 when he
quit his job.
	   It wasn't immediately clear why he resigned.
	   ''The concerned countries should hold an inquiry as to how a
trickster got a visa when genuine applicants face hardships in
getting visas for Western countries,'' the Associated Press of
Pakistan quoted Hussein as saying.
	   ''How did he get access to the world media and hire an attorney
in the United States?'' asked Hussein. ''These are points that
ought to be pondered by the concerned countries.''
	   Hussein called Khan's allegations ''a false story aimed at
maligning Pakistan and exacerbating tension in the region.''
	   India and Pakistan both conducted underground nuclear tests in
May, sparking fears of a nuclear arms race on the Asian
subcontinent, an area that has seen three wars in the last 51
years.
	   Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub dismissed as ''nonsense''
Khan's allegation that Pakistan was planning a first strike against
India.
	   The government also said that scientists are not involved in
meetings to map out combat strategy.

Clinton gets stuck in Hong Kong elevator
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Just because you're president of the United
States doesn't mean you can't get stuck in an elevator. It happened
to Bill Clinton on Friday _ for 10 long minutes.
	   Finally, the elevator doors were pried open and Clinton was
freed, along with his wife, Hillary, chief of staff Erskine Bowles
and some Secret Service agents.
	   Apparently a lightning bolt in a thunderstorm triggered a power
surge that knocked out a computer at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center. The loss of power stopped Clinton's elevator
after he spoke to a group of business leaders.
	   A backup power source kicked in that allowed the elevator to
move to a floor but the doors would not open, presidential
spokesman Barry Toiv said. The agents with Clinton radioed for
help; it was clear to agents waiting for the president that
something was amiss, Toiv said.
	   After the 10-minute wait, ``they pried open the doors,'' Toiv
said. ``Nobody was overly concerned. They were cracking jokes about
it, the president and everybody.''

Nevis Premier finds niche in Small Islands conference
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUSAN LINNEE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LE REDUIT, Mauritius (AP) _ Vance W. Amory may have had to
travel half way around the world, but he could not have found a a
forum more interested in what he had to say.
	   The premier of Nevis, which makes up one-half the tiny,
independent Caribbean island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, came to
explain to an international conference on small islands why he
wants to make it even smaller.
	   The International Small Islands Studies Association has no say
in whether Amory and his Concerned Citizens Movement succeed in
breaking away from the federation formed with St. Kitts at
independence from Britain in 1983.
	   His government is drawing up a constitution and plans to hold a
referendum among the 10,000 inhabitants of the 36-sqare-mile
(94-square-kilometer) island in the Leeward chain in the next three
months.
	   But many of the members of ISISA _ a laid-back, flexible group
of scholars, researchers and just plain island lovers who are
meeting in their fifth international gathering on this western
Indian Ocean island _ are intrigued by the example of a small,
vulnerable island trying to go it alone.
	   ``I don't think the issue of a small base or a small area should
be the prescribing issue of whether a country should be sovereign
but whether it can sustain itself,'' Amory told the conference.
	   Sustainable development is a major concern of participants who
come from 28 nations and islands from Papua New Guinea and Fiji to
Antigua.
	   Nevis has established an off-shore financial operation and does
well on upmarket tourism. But Amory says St. Kitts _ two miles away
_ spends only 21 percent of the federation's budget on Nevis while
the island provides 38 percent of the federation's tax revenue.
	   Amory's adviser and junior minister, Colin Tyrell, found out by
accident about the Small Islands conference over the Internet
through political scientist Barry Bartmann of Canada's Prince
Edward Island University.
	   ``Since I'm extremely interested in the process of secession, I
posted a question about Nevis on the St. Kitts' website,'' Bartmann
said during a break in conference proceedings.
	   If Nevis succeeds, it would become the latest in a group of
miniscule independent islands that already includes Paulu, Nauru
and Tuvalu, all in the South Pacific.
	   Economist Robert Read of England's Lancaster University says
political viability, not economic sustainability, would be the true
test for Nevis _ and secession is not an internationally favored
way to solve grievances within federations.
	   But, he said, ``if you've got 10 or 12,000 people who are
cohesive, cooperative and motivated, you can go a long way.''
	   As many Nevisians live outside the island as live on it _ in the
United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. And Amory says many
are anxious to return.
	   Read pointed out that an independent Nevis would enter the world
as a member of the Federation of Eastern Caribbean States. It would
continue to use the Eastern Caribbean dollar that is pegged to the
U.S. dollar and would not have to worry about a stable currency or
interest rates _ which have already been set by a higher
institution.
	   In fact, he said, despite its tininess and insularity, Nevis
would be in much better shape than the Ukraine or other former
Soviet republics that have had to create their economies and
economic institutions from scratch.
	   But fellow economist Mark Hampton cautioned that the secrecy
that makes offshore finance centers viable is coming increasingly
under question by international institutions and larger states.
	   ``I'm saying that the world has changed drastically, even in the
past three years. Small islands would be ill-advised to rely on
OFCs for their entire economies,'' he told a workshop on islanders
and political economy.
	   The ISISA, which has no governmental or official affiliation,
has about 100 dues-paying members but no physical headquarters. It
was formed after another small islands conference in Okinawa in
1994. Previous informal conferences on small islands have been held
in Victoria, British Columbia in 1984, Tasmania in 1988 and Nassau,
Bahamas in 1992.

	   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) _ Russia, China and three Central Asian
countries called Friday for a nuclear-free zone in the region and
expressed concern over the recent nuclear tests in Pakistan and
India.
	   The five-country summit focused on regional security issues and
efforts to prevent an arms buildup in Central Asia. After gaining
independence in 1991, Kazakstan gave up the nuclear weapons it
inherited from the Soviet Union, and does not want to see them
re-introduced.
	   ``We are particularly concerned about the recent series of
underground nuclear explosions by India and Pakistan,'' said
Kazakstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev. The tests ``not only
worsened the relationship between these countries, but also the
situation on the Asian continent.''
	   The foreign ministers from the countries at the summit _ Russia,
China, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan _ signed a joint
declaration calling for an end to the nuclear arms race in Asia.
They also called for the prevention of any national or religious
separatism in their countries.
	   China is concerned about independence demands by some members of
the the Uighurs, an ethnic minority in western China. There is also
a sizable Uighur population in Kazakstan.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin said the five countries at the
summit needed to work together against any threats to the stability
of the region.
	   During the Soviet era, there were often tensions along the
Soviet-Chinese border. In recent years, the five countries have
been meeting regularly to improve relations and introduce
confidence-building measures, such as troop reductions, along their
borders.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who was filling in
for Russian leader Boris Yeltsin, noted that the tensions between
India and Pakistan were related to a dispute over land and borders
in the Kashmir region. He said Central Asian countries should not
allow the same thing to happen in their region.
	   Primakov said the Kazak president would visit Moscow next week
and that he had Yeltsin would sign an agreement on the division of
the Caspian Sea, one of the most promising sources of oil and gas
in the world.
	   The agreement calls for the seabed to be divided into national
sectors, while the water and surface will be shared.

Serbs regain control of key Kosovo crossroads

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces recaptured a
key crossroads area in Kosovo on Friday, breaking a more than
two-week siege by ethnic Albanian militants.
	   The retaking of Kijevo, which U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke this
week called ``the most dangerous place in Europe,'' was reported by
both Serb and ethnic Albanian sources and confirmed by Western
diplomats. It came just hours before scheduled talks in Belgrade
between Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic aimed
at producing a cease-fire in the Serbian province.
	   Journalists were not immediately allowed into the area, and
accounts of casualties were conflicting.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center claimed there were many
killed and wounded in the dawn attack, in which they said the Serbs
targeted five villages with tanks, helicopters and artillery.
	   But Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
their intelligence reports indicated casualties were not high
because the Kosovo Liberation Army saw the attack coming and
retreated without resisting.
	   Journalists were not immediately able to reach Kijevo _ a
crossroads and KLA stronghold located 25 kilometers (15 miles) west
of Pristina.
	   Earlier reports by Serb media suggested that retaking the
Serb-populated village and surrounding area was the remaining goal
of the latest crackdown by Milosevic's forces in the secessionist
province. The other was the recapture of the strategic Belacevac
mine region, which they accomplished Tuesday after two days of
nearly non-stop fighting.
	   Underscoring the high tensions throughout Kosovo, a
remote-controlled bomb exploded early Friday in a Serb residential
area of the capital Pristina. No injuries were reported but windows
on nearby buildings and blown out and several cars were damaged in
an attack Serb police blamed on the KLA.
	   Also, Yugoslav fighter jets continued their recent tactic of
flying low over the city. Ethnic Albanians say the buzzing is aimed
at intimidating them.
	   Sitting astride the main east-west road in the southern Yugoslav
province, Kijevo has been a flashpoint since the KLA surrounded it
in mid-June and cut off its Serb inhabitants and police. Serb
police had then surrounded the KLA fighters.
	   Holbrooke, who tried to get the KLA to break the siege last
month, has said he feared Milosevic would use massive force to
retake it, possibly resulting in tragedy.
	   Serb police sources said they had suffered no injuries in
Friday's action, which they wrapped up about 7:30 a.m., but the
ethnic Albanians had undetermined casualties.
	   Belgrade's independent Beta news agency quoted a Serbian police
source as saying police entered Kijevo Friday morning to find some
100 Serb civilians and about 50 policemen who had been cut off by
the siege.
	   ``There is an ongoing action to search and clear the area around
Kijevo,'' the unidentified police source was quoted as saying,
confirming some fighting still continuing. The source said the
action had been done ``professionally.''
	   Ahead of talks with Holbrooke, Milosevic denied Thursday that
Yugoslav and Serb forces are involved in repressive actions against
civilians in Kosovo.
	   Despite the crackdown that has driven tens of thousands of
ethnic Albanians from their villages, the independent FoNet news
agency quoted him as saying: ``There are not, nor will there be any
repressive actions against the civilian population in Kosovo.''
	   Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo in recent months, since
Serb forces stepped up efforts to crush militant resistance in late
February. Milosevic says the crackdown is aimed at Albanian
terrorists who have targeted Serb police and civilians in their
militant campaign for independence.
	   Milosevic, who has rejected international demands that he cease
his military campaign, reiterated that talks should begin
immediately with ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   Holbrooke is pushing for a cease-fire first before trying to get
Milosevic to withdraw his forces. But he and other Western
officials are insistent that Kosovo should not be allowed
independence, for fear of sparking a wider Balkans war.
	   Milosevic said again that he is willing to grant the province
the autonomy that he took away in 1989.
	   Ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova emphasized Friday that
Kosovo Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of the population of 2.2
million, aren't willing to drop their independence demands.
	   ``Autonomy is not a solution,'' he told reporters in Pristina.
``Our aim is an independent, neutral Kosovo with equal rights for
all.''

Vajpayee government unsure of key ally's support
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Lawmakers belonging to a powerful
regional ally boycotted Parliament on Friday, raising doubts about
the future of India's three-month-old Hindu nationalist-led
government.
	   Jayaram Jayalalitha, leader of the All India Anna Dravida
Munnetra Kazhgam party, or AIADMK, is trying to pressure Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee into dismissing the state government
in her southern home state of Tamil Nadu. The state government is
controlled by Jayalalitha's rivals.
	   Jayalalitha is scheduled to meet her supporters in Madras, the
capital of Tamil Nadu state, on Saturday to discuss whether to
continue supporting to the Vajpayee government, Press Trust of
India news agency said. Without the AIADMK, Vajpayee's shaky
coalition could fall.
	   In New Delhi, the BJP sought to play down the threat to its
government.
	   ``Everything will be settled and there is no threat to the
government,'' Madan Lal Khurana, the parliamentary affairs
minister, was quoted as telling local news agencies.
	   Eighteen AIADMK lawmakers stayed away from Parliament, which
resumed briefly Friday before adjourning in a sign of respect for a
lawmaker who recently died. The session that opened Friday will be
devoted to discussing the 1998-99 federal budget. A budget vote
expected later this month will be a crucial test for the Vajpayee
government.
	   In addition to the 18 AIADMK members, 12 members of other
parties are loyal to Jayalalitha. Those 30 votes are crucial for
the survival of the 20-party coalition government.
	   The BJP with its allies control 249 of 545 seats in Parliament.
The once dominant Congress party and its partners control 191 seats
and the centrist United Front 75. The rest are controlled by
independents.
	   India has had two general elections and four prime ministers in
the past two years.
	   Meanwhile, an opposition group from Jayalalitha's home state
announced that it would support the Congress party if it bid to
replace the Vajpayee government.
	   The Tamil Maanila Congress is part of the 13-party United Front.
Most of the front constituents have pledged to back a Congress-led
government.
	   But Congress says it would not pull down the Bharatiya Janata
Party-led government through a no-confidence vote. It will step,
Congress President Sonia Gandhi has said, only in if the Vajpayee
government collapses because ``inner contradictions.''

Activists win temporary custody of four circus lions

	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Four circus lions so infirm they can barely
chew their meat had a home for the time being in a national park
after animal rights activists won a temporary custody battle.
	   The Bombay High Court ruled Thursday that the female lions aged
10 to 17 years, three of them blind and the fourth pregnant, should
stay at the national park until pending criminal trials of the
circus owners, who are accused of mistreating the animals. The
Great Golden Circus had demanded the lions be returned pending
trial.
	   The lions have been in the park in northern Bombay since Oct.
30, when the animal rights group Ahimsa complained to authorities
that they were being forced to perform despite weak health and that
they had been beaten and denied proper food.
	   If convicted, the circus could lose the lions and lose the right
to keep any more animals. Great Golden officials have denied
mistreating the lions.
	   Park authorities said Friday that the four lions were gaining
strength.
	   ``They are eating better now. They were very weak when they came
here. Now at least they are moving around a little,'' said Suresh
Gairola.
	   When the lions arrived at the park along with two others who
have since died, they were too weak to stand. They were put in
enclosures because they were too ill to fend for themselves in the
park's open spaces.
	   The lions' meat still has to be cut into bite-size pieces. Their
teeth are weak and rotten, apparently due to years of malnutrition.
	   Big cats draw crowds to Indian circuses, where they are made to
jump through burning hoops or balance on small stools. Animal
rights activists say circus owners torture and starve the animals
to get them to perform.
	   Satnam Ahuja, of the Ahimsa group, said he saw one of the lions
being whipped and beaten about the face with a metal road during a
performance in Bombay in October.
	   Beatings, malnutrition and exposure to floodlights may have
resulted in blindness for three of the lions, Ahimsa said.

U.N. nuclear team ends mission in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. nuclear experts left Iraq Friday after
five days of talks with officials on Iraq's past atomic program.
	   The experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency were
seeking evidence on whether Iraq had given up its past program,
Garry Dillon, the team leader, said in a press release issued
Friday.
	   The International Atomic Energy Agency is overseeing the
elimination of Iraq's nuclear program, a condition of the 1991 Gulf
War cease-fire.
	   Dillon, who arrived with two IAEA colleagues Monday, said he
asked Iraq for details on the degree of external assistance that
Baghdad received as part of the program.
	   U.N. weapons inspectors have said Iraq was only a year away from
exploding a nuclear device.
	   The IAEA delegation also met with Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz during its stay in Baghdad.
	   An April report by the IAEA, the nuclear watchdog of the United
Nations, said it found no evidence of any prohibited activities.
	   But the agency said Iraq needed to provide more documents on its
past nuclear activities.
	   Dillon did not say whether Iraq provided him with the necessary
documentation.
	   The U.N. Security Council is scheduled to meet by the end of
July to review an IAEA report which Dillon said will include the
results of his visit to Baghdad.
	   The Security Council has said the trade sanctions it imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait will not be lifted until Iraq
has eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Here's a new X-Files mystery: What's this sport
played with two nets and a ball?
	   David Duchovny, star of the popular American science fiction
series, has stumbled across the World Cup while in France promoting
the ``X-Files'' movie.
	   ``I know a little bit about American football, but I don't
really know anything about soccer,'' Duchovny told the daily Le
Parisien: ``I did follow the United States team matches, a little
bit on TV and in the papers. I realize how much here, in France,
soccer impassions the people.''

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Restaurant customers watching a World
Cup soccer match thought fellow diner Attachai Deesaraphan was
joking when he stood up, pulled a gun and announced a robbery.
	   Then he fired three shots, and the laughter stopped.
	   Attachai, now in custody, told The Nation that the customers
didn't take him seriously at first because he refereed to the
International Monetary Fund when announcing the stick-up. The IMF
has been blamed by many Thais for worsening the country's economic
crisis.
	   Attachai silenced the laughter by firing three shots into the
air, then robbed the clients. He was taken into custody Wednesday
after failing to pay a bill at another restaurant.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Both national leaders will be on hand when
Germany plays Croatia in the World Cup quarterfinals on Saturday.
	   Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, both passionate soccer fans, will join some 42,000 spectators
at Stade Gerland for the evening kickoff.
	   Tudjman will also have lunch with the Croat team before the game
at its residence in a chateau outside Lyon, team sources said
Friday.
	   The 76-year-old leader had promised to come to the World Cup if
Croatia reached the last eight.
	   ``Most state leaders attend their national team's World Cup
successes,'' Croatian newspaper Vjesnik quoted Tudjman as saying.
``It is proper for the Croatian president to do the same.''
	   Soccer-mad Croatia was euphoric at seeing its team defeat
Romania 1-0 on Tuesday to become the first nation in 24 years to
make the quarterfinals on its first try.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Germany's No. 3 goalkeeper Jens Lehmann of
Schalke 04 said Saturday he had signed a three-year contract with
AC Milan.
	   Lehmann joins two other German internationals, who are with the
Italian team _ Christian Ziege and Oliver Bierhoff.
	   Shortly after signing the contract Friday, Lehmann was injured
in practice when a ball hit him in the eye.
	   He checked into a local hospital because he was unable to see,
but was released later in the day when his sight returned.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ The chairman of the English Football Association
wants Glenn Hoddle to lead England into the next World Cup, despite
the team's second-round exit from France 98.
	   Keith Wiseman was quoted in Friday's Sun newspaper as saying
England was ``in safe hands'' with Hoddle as coach.
	   ``Glenn is only halfway through his current agreement and when
he wants a new one, we will talk,'' Wiseman said.
	   Hoddle signed a four-year deal with the FA when he took over as
coach from Terry Venables in June 1996. The Sun said his 250,000
pound (dlrs 415,000) annual salary could be doubled in a new
agreement.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ A charity fund in Germany for the French policeman
left in a coma by German soccer thugs has raised at least 5,000
marks (dlrs 9,900), World Cup officials said Friday.
	   FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said thousands of people had made
contributions to the fund, which benefits the family of officer
David Nivel, 44, of Lens.
	   Cooper said the exact amount raised would not be disclosed to
protect the family's interests.
	   Nivel was left in a coma after German hooligans beat him over
the head with an iron bar when Germany played Yugoslavia in Lens
last month.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ It's only happened 29 times in 572 World Cup
matches: a goal in the final minute of regulation time.
	   FIFA said a check of all those games found just six game-winning
goals in the last minute, and seven others that produced ties.
	   Ten of the goals were in injury time, the federation said,
including four penalties and even an own goal.

WWF: Tearing down fences gives rare animals new chance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: The World Wildlife Fund is known as the World Wide Fund for
Nature outside the U.S. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GLAND, Switzerland (AP) _ A decision by Botswana to remove
fences on its border with Namibia will improve the survival chances
of rare southern African animals, the World Wildlife Fund said
Friday.
	   The endangered African wild dog and roan antelope are two
species that likely will benefit from the move to tear down 30
kilometers (18 1/2 miles) of fences that blocked their migratory
routes, WWF said in a statement.
	   Botswana's government said in May it will bring down the fences,
built last year to contain an outbreak of bovine lung disease which
led to the slaughter of some 318,000 head of cattle, WWF spokesman
Javier Arreaza said.
	   The decision came after Namibia expressed concern over the
impact of the fences on wildlife in its northeastern Caprivi Strip.
	   Namibia's narrow West Caprivi Game Reserve, sandwiched between
Botswana and Angola, is home to some 4,500 elephants, as well as
cheetahs and other endangered species.
	   ``Access by these species to water and grazing in northern
Botswana is crucial for their continued survival,'' the WWF
statement said.
	   Since the late 1950s, Botswana has used the fences to help
protect the country's valuable cattle stock from outbreaks of
disease. But they have led to ``a slow strangulation of what were
once vast wildlife resources,'' according to WWF.
	   Authorities have said they will consider taking down more of the
total 190 kilometers (118 miles) of fencing in the country, Arreaza
said.

Five more soldiers desert Yugoslav army
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS that soldiers deserted June 6, locator &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Five Yugoslav army soldiers who ``refused
to kill women and children'' deserted in Kosovo and were escorted
into Albania on Friday, OSCE officials said.
	   The soldiers surrendered to the Kosovo Liberation Army on June 6
and were finally taken across the border Thursday night. At the
village of Vllahe 200 kilometers (120 miles) north of Tirana, they
were turned in to Albanian police.
	   The soldiers were being taken Friday to the Albanian capital
Tirana, where they will stay at the mission of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe for an undetermined period,
according to the Interior Ministry.
	   ``As they have told our police in the north, they refused to
kill women and children,'' said an Interior Ministry official who
requested anonymity. ``That's why they have deserted.''
	   All five of the soldiers _ two from Montenegro and three from
Serbia _ have Muslim names. Ethnic Albanians also are predominantly
Muslim.
	   Dozens of Yugoslav soldiers have deserted in recent weeks, and
increasing numbers of Serbian police have refused to serve in
largely Albanian Kosovo, where fighting has intensified this year
between Serb-led forces and ethnic Albanian militants.
	   Many of the army deserters and draft dodgers come from
Montenegro, larger Serbia's only remaining partner in the Yugoslav
Federation.
	   A Montenegro deputy parliament speaker, Rifat Rastoder, said
Friday that 105 Montenegrin conscripts on military duty in Kosovo
have deserted in the last two months _ half of them Muslims.

Bangladesh objects to conditions in U.S. military agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladesh doesn't want U.S. soldiers
to have unrestricted access to its territory, an objection that has
blocked a military cooperation accord between the two countries.
	   An official at the Foreign Ministry, speaking on condition of
anonymity Friday, said Bangladesh would sign the agreement if
Washington dropped provisions allowing U.S. troops to enter
Bangladesh without specific permission, passports or visas.
	   He said Bangladesh was awaiting the U.S. response to its
objections, which had been officially conveyed in March.
	   U.S. Ambassador John Holzman, during a visit to the northeastern
town of Sylhet earlier this week, told reporters he expected
Bangladesh to sign the agreement. Holzman was not available for
comment Friday.
	   ``We will not accept the agreement,'' said Mujahidul Islam
Selim, a leader of the opposition Communist Party of Bangladesh.
Selim said the agreement was tantamount to establishing an American
military base in Bangladesh, an allegation the U.S. embassy has
denied.
	   The agreement provides for the joint military exercises and help
from U.S. troops in time of emergency such as floods and cyclones.
The U.S. has responded in emergencies in the past, but argues a
permanent agreement would be more effective.
	   The United States diverted troops who were on the way home from
Gulf War duty to Bangladesh in 1991 to help with relief efforts
after a 1991 cyclone killed 138,000 people.

World Cup: Life stops in Italy for match with France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ There's no such thing as ``just another game'' when
it comes to Italy and the World Cup.
	   An estimated nine out of every 10 televisions in this
soccer-loving country were tuning in Friday to watch the Azzurri
take on the hosts in the first quarterfinal of France '98.
	   By the early afternoon, the normally bustling historic center
was an eerie quiet generally reserved for national holidays. Police
were closing off traffic on a main thoroughfare near the Spanish
Steps during and after the match to keep out any celebrants --
should Italy win.
	   Many people had already gathered in one of the eight spots
around the capital where giant screens were set up to broadcast the
game. Outdoor viewing was also available in several cities across
Italy, from Milan to Florence.
	   ``No one is around,'' said Cleto Vacca, sweeping his hand toward
rows of empty tables at his cafe near Piazza Venezia in the heart
of Rome. ``I'm doing no business. Maybe someone will come to watch
on that,'' he added hopefully, pointing to a TV he brought from
home.
	   Red-green-and-white flags dotted bars, restaurants and apartment
windows, while some fans walked around with painted faces.
	   Others were looking forward to the spectacle.
	   ``I'm not that interested in sports, but Italians are very
emotional about soccer,'' said Ernie Terga, a 39-year-old from
Queens, New York, on a two-month tour through Europe. ``I want to
check it out, see what the hoopla's all about.''
	   Vacca, the bar owner, said he was looking forward to the kickoff
for another reason.
	   ``I'm taking advantage,'' he said. ``With no one around, I can
get some errands done. Hey, you can't live by soccer alone.''
	   He was certainly in the minority on Friday in Italy.

Government defers bill on women's quota in parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian political parties can't agree on
passing a law setting aside federal and state parliamentary seats
for women, so the government put the bill on hold Friday.
	   The Bharatiya Janata Party-led governing coalition said the bill
would be introduced only after support was assured. The bill had
been on the legislative calendar for Friday, but was taken off.
	   Parliamentary Affairs Minister Madan Lal Khurana set no new date
for tabling the bill, first introduced in 1996 by a previous
government but never put to a vote.
	   Leftists lawmakers, who have been the staunchest supporters of
the bill to reserve a third of parliament and state assembly seats
for women, staged a sit-in near the entrance to parliament Friday
to protest lack of progress on the proposal.
	   Women members of the centrist Congress party, the main
opposition, also demonstrated, demanding the bill be tabled and
passed immediately.
	   The government ``lacks political will,'' said Nasreen Faiyaz of
the National Alliance for Women. ``It shows a feudal and
patriarchal unwillingness to share power with women.''
	   The main objection to the bill came from the Democratic Front
party, which wants the quota to be lowered from 33 percent to 15
percent. The Front, which represents lower castes and Muslims in
northern India, also wants a quota within the quota for women from
the groups they represent.
	   A 1995 federal law set aside a third of the seats on municipal
and village councils for women.
	   In many cases the law has had the intended effect _ increasing
the participation of women in India's democracy. But some women
face opposition at the local level. Male politicians have attended
council sessions in place of their elected wives or daughters,
ousted women in no-confidence votes, and scheduled meetings late in
the evening _ a time when women in small, traditional communities
would be unlikely to leave their homes.

Maradona finally makes it to the World Cup _ as a commentator
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ If it were up to Diego Maradona, there would be a
``Hand of God II.''
	   Before leaving Buenos Aires to fly to the World Cup, the
Argentine superstar said that, despite British media reports to the
contrary, he had ``never'' apologized for the famous ``Hand of
God'' goal that helped Argentina beat England 2-1 at the 1986 World
Cup in Mexico.
	   Maradona instead described the goal as an ``astute'' play, which
he ``would repeat, not only against England, but against any team
in the world.''
	   Maradona, who retired last year at 37, will serve as a
commentator for Argentine television during his stay at France 98.
He had postponed his trip several times, saying he was too
depressed to travel because he wasn't able to play in a World Cup
for the first time since 1982 and because he recently received a
two-year, 10-month suspended jail sentence for injuring a reporter
with an air rifle in 1994.
	   Maradona left the 1994 World Cup in the United States in
disgrace after being banned from the tournament after testing
positive for stimulants.
	   This time he made a quiet entrance, avoiding a crowd of waiting
journalists as he arrived Friday morning at Charles de Gaulle
airport. He planned to attend the France-Italy quarterfinal game
Friday afternoon at Saint-Denis on the outskirts of Paris and then
travel to Marseille, where Argentina plays the Netherlands on
Saturday.
	   Before boarding his plane in Buenos Aires, Maradona predicted
Italy would beat France and that Argentina would eliminate the
Netherlands. He picked Argentina and Italy as the most likely
finalists.

Serbs regain control of key Kosovo crossroads
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Western diplomats confirming
Kijevo recaptured, conflicting accounts of casualties; TRIMS &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces recaptured a
key crossroads in Kosovo on Friday, breaking a more than two-week
siege by ethnic Albanian militants.
	   The retaking of Kijevo, which U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke this
week called ``the most dangerous place in Europe,'' was reported by
both Serb and ethnic Albanian sources and confirmed by Western
diplomats.
	   It came hours before scheduled talks in Belgrade between
Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on producing a
cease-fire in the Serbian province.
	   Journalists were not immediately allowed into the area around
Kijevo, a crossroads and KLA stronghold 25 kilometers (15 miles)
west of Pristina, and there were conflicting accounts of
casualties.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center claimed there
were many killed and wounded in the dawn attack, in which they said
the Serbs targeted five villages with tanks, helicopters and
artillery.
	   But Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
their intelligence reports indicated that casualties were not high
because the Kosovo Liberation Army saw the attack coming and
retreated without resisting.
	   Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo since Serb forces stepped
up efforts to crush militant resistance in late February. Milosevic
says the crackdown is aimed at Albanian terrorists who have
targeted Serb police and civilians in their militant campaign for
independence.
	   Milosevic, who has rejected international demands that he cease
his military campaign, reiterated that talks should begin
immediately with ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   Holbrooke is pushing for a cease-fire first before trying to get
Milosevic to withdraw his forces. But he and other Western
officials are insistent that Kosovo should not be allowed
independence, for fear of sparking a wider Balkans war.
	   Milosevic said again that he is willing to grant the province
the autonomy that he took away in 1989.
	   Ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova emphasized Friday that
Kosovo Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of the population of 2.2
million, aren't willing to drop their independence demands.
	   ``Autonomy is not a solution,'' he said in Pristina. ``Our aim
is an independent, neutral Kosovo with equal rights for all.''
	   Earlier reports by Serb media suggested that retaking the
Serb-populated village of Kijevo and its surrounding area was the
remaining goal of the latest crackdown by Milosevic's forces in the
secessionist province. The other was the recapture of the strategic
Belacevac mine region, which they accomplished Tuesday after two
days of nearly non-stop fighting.
	   Underscoring the high tensions throughout Kosovo, a
remote-controlled bomb exploded early Friday in a Serb residential
area of the capital, Pristina. No injuries were reported but
windows on nearby buildings were blown out and several cars were
damaged in an attack Serb police blamed on the KLA.
	   Also, Yugoslav fighter jets continued their recent tactic of
flying low over the city. Ethnic Albanians say the buzzing meant to
intimidate them.
	   Sitting astride the main east-west road in the southern Yugoslav
province, Kijevo has been a flashpoint since the KLA surrounded it
in mid-June and cut off its Serb inhabitants and police. Serb
police then surrounded the KLA fighters.
	   Holbrooke, who tried to get the KLA to break the siege last
month, had said he feared Milosevic would use massive force to
retake it, possibly resulting in tragedy.
	   Serb police sources said they suffered no injuries in Friday's
action, but the ethnic Albanians had undetermined casualties.
	   Belgrade's independent Beta news agency quoted a Serbian police
source as saying police entered Kijevo Friday morning to find about
100 Serb civilians and about 50 policemen who had been cut off by
the siege.
	   The unidentified police source confirmed that some fighting
continued. The source said the action had been done
``professionally.''

U.N. nuclear team ends mission in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. nuclear experts left Iraq on Friday
after five days of talks with officials on Iraq's past atomic
program.
	   The experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency were
seeking evidence on whether Iraq had given up its program, team
leader Garry Dillon said in a news release issued Friday.
	   The IAEA is overseeing the elimination of Iraq's nuclear
program, a condition of the 1991 Gulf War cease-fire. The Security
Council has said the trade sanctions it imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait will not be lifted until Iraq has eliminated all
its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Dillon, who arrived with two IAEA colleagues Monday, said he
asked Iraq for details on the degree of external assistance that
Baghdad received as part of the program. The IAEA delegation also
met with Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   U.N. weapons inspectors have said that Iraq had been only a year
away from exploding a nuclear device.
	   An April report by the IAEA, the nuclear watchdog of the United
Nations, said it found no evidence of any prohibited activities.
But the agency said Iraq needed to provide more documents.
	   Dillon did not say whether Iraq provided him with the necessary
documentation.
	   The U.N. Security Council is scheduled to meet by the end of
July to review an IAEA report which Dillon said will include the
results of his visit to Baghdad.

German trial of five in refugee home arson attack nearing end
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT AN DER ODER, Germany (AP) _ The trial of five men for
a 1992 arson attack on a refugee home in eastern Germany neared an
end Friday following the surprise confession of two defendants.
	   Marco Schmidt, 25, admitted he had helped put together a Molotov
cocktail, and his stepfather, Hans-Juergen Schmidt, 49, admitted he
knew what his stepson was doing but did nothing about it. He also
said he told those carrying out the arson where to find the house
in Dolgenbrodt, a lakeside resort village of 250 people southeast
of Berlin.
	   The two had previously denied any role in the Nov. 1, 1992 fire,
which destroyed the newly constructed refugee home the night before
86 Africans were to move in.
	   Following the statement read by the Schmidts' lawyer, the court
decided to stop taking testimony and scheduled closing arguments by
defense attorneys and prosecutors, opening the way for a possible
verdict late Friday.
	   In May 1993 authorities arrested Silvio Jaskowski, 18 at the
time and a neo-Nazi. He was convicted of arson in a 1996 trial and
sentenced to two years on probation.
	   Based on information from Jaskowski, prosecutors uncovered what
proved to be a conspiracy involving not only disaffected youths but
also otherwise upstanding citizens who wanted to keep the
asylum-seekers out.
	   Last week, Thomas Oste, 41, Dolgenbrodt's florist, admitted in
court he paid 11,000 marks (dlrs 6,000) to have a neo-Nazi set the
blaze and keep quiet about it. He said he was afraid that criminals
would move into the house, which was next door to his.
	   Gerd Graefen, a 50-year-old electrician and neighbor of Oste,
told the court two days later he gave Oste 300 marks (dlrs 165) to
help pay for the arson.
	   The court decided Friday to drop charges against Renato Paschke,
27, a friend of Jaskowski's who was accused of helping him set the
fire.
	   Paschke is already serving a longer prison term on a robbery
conviction and any testimony he might give would do little to
change the outcome of the trial, the Brandenburg state court said.
	   The four men still on trial were all charged with complicity.

 &UR; Israel, Palestinians trade accusations after Gaza standoff &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and the Palestinians traded blame Friday
after troops from both sides confronted each other with cocked
assault rifles and armored personnel carriers in what had started
as a routine argument over control of a Gaza Strip road.
	   The new display of distrust came at a time when the United
States appeared to be making little headway in winning Israeli
agreement to a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested Friday that
the 12-hour showdown in Gaza, during which Palestinian truckers
blockaded Jewish settlements, could make Israel even more hesitant
to hand over land to the Palestinians. Israeli hardliners claim
that a troop pullback would leave more than a dozen settlements
isolated and at the mercy of the Palestinians.
	   ``You could also understand how sensitive we are to the issue of
redeployment which could place tens of thousands of Israelis ... at
great peril any time the Palestinians decide to violate the
agreement, as they did last night,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of having staged a deliberate
provocation, and said Israel would not succumb to threats of
violence.
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, dismissed
Netanyahu's accusation, saying the Palestinian Authority had made
every possible effort to defuse the situation.
	   ``He (Netanyahu) is the one to be blamed for the tense situation
on the ground'' because he has refused to live up to Israel's
promises, including a troop pullback, Erekat said.
	   The Gaza confrontation began with a seemingly routine argument
over the use of a road. About two-thirds of the Gaza Strip is
controlled by the Palestinian Authority, but Israeli troops patrol
near Jewish settlements and control several access roads.
	   On Thursday afternoon, Palestinian Supplies Minister Abdel Azziz
Shaheen demanded that Israel allow a convoy of 22 Palestinian cars
to use a coastal route it controls.
	   Israeli soldiers said they would let Shaheen pass because as a
Cabinet minister he has special privileges, but told the others to
turn back.
	   The dispute quickly escalated into scuffles and shouting matches
between Israeli and Palestinian troops. Israeli troops stationed
three APCs on a road linking two major Gaza Strip cities and
created a large traffic jam. In retaliation, Palestinian police
ordered dozens of trucks to block access roads to Jewish
settlements. Israel, in turn, sealed off the Gaza Strip.
	   As night fell, both sides dug roadside trenches and took up
positions just a few dozen meters from one another, with rifles
pointed.
	   Under a compromise reached early Friday, with the help of U.S.
Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross, the Palestinians agreed to move
the trucks from the settlement roads while Israel allowed Shaheen
and his convoy to drive along the coastal road.
	   In other developments Friday:
	   _ Israel's outgoing armed forces chief of staff undercut
Netanyahu's initial claim that a 13 percent troop pullback would
endanger Israel's security, and that Israel could hand over no more
than 9 percent. ``The difference ... between 9 and 13 percent _
it's not that it is trivial, not that it is unimportant _ but it is
certainly not very, very dramatic,'' Lt. Gen. Amnon Shahak told
Israel army radio in a farewell interview.
	   _ Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan, citing an intelligence
report, said 21 prominent Islamic militants have been recruited by
Palestinian police, including six involved in planning suicide
bombings in Israel. If confirmed, the report would undermine
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's claim that he is doing the best
he can to rein in Islamic militants.

Abiola's wife says he'll be free soon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GILBERT DA COSTA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Moshood Abiola, Nigeria's best-known
political prisoner and the presumed winner of presidential
elections in 1993, will probably be freed in the coming days, one
of his wives has said.
	   ``We have every reason to believe he will be freed any moment
from now,'' Doyin Abiola, who manages Abiola's newspaper group,
told Lagos Radio late Thursday night.
	   Mrs. Abiola also said she had met with Emeka Anyaoku, the
secretary-general of the commonwealth of former British colonies,
since his meeting with her husband earlier this week. But she gave
no further details.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced Thursday that
Nigeria will free all of its remaining political prisoners,
including Abiola. He gave no timetable on the releases, just saying
``the government will make an announcement at the appropriate
time.''
	   There are believed to be between 250 and 280 political prisoners
still held in Nigerian prisons, though thousands were arrested at
various times during the rule of Gen. Sani Abacha, the Nigerian
dictator who died last month. His successor, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar, has repeatedly signaled that he intends to break from his
predecessor's policies.
	   The Provisional Ruling Council, the core of the ruling junta,
met Thursday night to discuss the releases, government officials
said on condition of anonymity. However, it was not immediate clear
whether their meeting was continuing Friday.

WWF: Tearing down fences gives rare animals new chance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REPLACES ``World Wildlife Fund'' in lead with ``World Wide
Fund for Nature.'' The organization is known as World Wildlife Fund
in North America. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GLAND, Switzerland (AP) _ A decision by Botswana to remove
fences on its border with Namibia will improve the survival chances
of rare southern African animals, the World Wide Fund for Nature
said Friday.
	   The endangered African wild dog and roan antelope are two
species that likely will benefit from the move to tear down 30
kilometers (18 1/2 miles) of fences that blocked their migratory
routes, WWF said in a statement.
	   Botswana's government said in May it will bring down the fences,
built last year to contain an outbreak of bovine lung disease which
led to the slaughter of some 318,000 head of cattle, WWF spokesman
Javier Arreaza said.
	   The decision came after Namibia expressed concern over the
impact of the fences on wildlife in its northeastern Caprivi Strip.
	   Namibia's narrow West Caprivi Game Reserve, sandwiched between
Botswana and Angola, is home to some 4,500 elephants, as well as
cheetahs and other endangered species.
	   ``Access by these species to water and grazing in northern
Botswana is crucial for their continued survival,'' the WWF
statement said.
	   Since the late 1950s, Botswana has used the fences to help
protect the country's valuable cattle stock from outbreaks of
disease. But they have led to ``a slow strangulation of what were
once vast wildlife resources,'' according to WWF.
	   Authorities have said they will consider taking down more of the
total 190 kilometers (118 miles) of fencing in the country, Arreaza
said.

Court sentences soldiers to death for rape, murder of Tamil girl

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Five Sri Lankan soldiers and a police
officer sentenced to death Friday for rape and murder claimed that
they merely buried the victims' bodies and could show authorities
the graves of hundreds of other Tamil civilians killed by security
forces.
	   The rape and murder case had been closely followed in Sri Lanka
as a test of the government's commitment to protecting minorities
and punishing attacks against them.
	   ``We didn't kill anyone. We only buried bodies. We can show you
where 300 to 400 bodies have been buried,'' Corporal Dewage
Somaratne said when judges asked him why he should not be given the
death sentence. His codefendants, three privates and a police
constable, echoed his claim. One soldier escaped and was tried in
absentia, and another was acquitted Friday.
	   The government admits as many as 500 Tamil civilians have
disappeared in the northern Jaffna Peninsula since the military
drove out Tamil rebels and took control of the Tamil heartland in
May 1996.
	   Tamil politicians and human rights groups say many vanished
after being arrested by government troops hunting guerrillas.
	   The judges are likely to refer the statements on hidden bodies
to local magistrates, who can then search for the graves.
	   The security officers were convicted of raping and strangling
Krishanthi Kumaraswamy, an 18-year-old student stopped at a
military checkpoint near the Jaffna Peninsula village of Chemmanihi
in September 1996.
	   Her mother, Rasamma Kumaraswamy, 16-year-old brother Pranavan
Kumaraswamy, and a neighbor, Kiruba Moorthy, who went to the
checkpoint looking for her, were also killed.
	   The military at first denied any knowledge of the incident. But
shortly after the four bodies were found in an old salt mine near
the checkpoint, nine members of the security forces were arrested.
One of them died in prison and charges against another were
dropped.
	   ``The accused all held responsible posts in the police and armed
forces. Yet, they fell upon this innocent girl like wild animals
and raped and murdered her,'' said Judge Gamini Abeyratne, part of
a special three-judge panel that handed down maximum penalties
Friday.
	   No one has been hanged since 1977 in Sri Lanka. Death sentences
are usually commuted to life in prison, but President Chandrika
Kumaratunga may hesitate to do so in this case.
	   The verdicts and sentences can be appealed in two higher courts,
before Mrs. Kumaratunga has to decide whether to carry out the
hangings.
	   In the past, Tamils have cited abuse and arrogance by government
soldiers as one of the causes of Tamil discontent. Militant Tamils
are fighting a war against the Sri Lankan military for an
independent Tamil homeland.
	   They say they are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese who control the government and the military. More than
54,000 people have been died in the war that started in 1983.

Polish aristocrats say ownership claim neglected by U.S.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Heirs of Polish aristocrats blamed the
U.S. government for failing to respond to their claim that they own
the American embassy grounds and vowed Friday to step up pressure.
	   The case concerns the palace of the late Princess Roza
Czetwertynska, which stood on the central Warsaw site until 1960,
when the United States tore it down to build the embassy. Poland's
communist government in 1956 leased the property to the United
States for 80 years, with an option to extend the lease for an
additional 20 years.
	   Last August, descendants of the Czetwertynski family picketed
the U.S. embassy and delivered a petition.
	   Addressing a news conference Friday, Albert Czetwertynski, a
grandson of the late princess, said the family never received an
answer from the U.S. government.
	   ``This is very impolite,'' he said, ``the U.S. government did
not even acknowledge receiving the letter.''
	   U.S. diplomats were unavailable for comment Friday as the
embassy was closed for a holiday.
	   Czetwertynski said family members, living in the United States,
Canada, Switzerland and Belgium, will send letters to governments
and political leaders to step up pressure.
	   He said they hoped to sit and talk with American officials and
indicated they were looking for compensation: ``Any offer by the
U.S. government will be treated very seriously.''
	   Last year, the embassy said in a statement the property was
acquired according to Polish and American laws, and that the
Czetwertynski family should address their claim to Polish
authorities.
	   The diplomats said the State Department was reviewing old
embassy files to check the case.
	   A Washington-based law firm representing the family asked for a
meeting with State Department officials to discuss the claim, but
was told the office was not authorized to deal with it,
Czetwertynski said.
	   He also said the documents gathered by the lawyers showed that
signing the deal with the communists in 1956, ``the Americans knew
very well that the property belonged to my father.''
	   During the news conference, Czetwertynski played a recording of
a television interview with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
who justified legal measures for trafficking in confiscated
American property in Cuba in the so-called Helms and Burton Act.
	   He argued their case was similar and that American law should be
the same for everyone.
	   The family also plans to take action against the Polish
government to demand restoration of ownership. The case is among
dozens of claims by former owners of Warsaw properties that were
nationalized by communist authorities in the late 1940s and early
1950s.
	   Nine years after the fall of communism, Poland still has no law
for settling claims of private property taken over by the
communists, but several buildings have recently been returned to
old owners who took their case to court.

Report: 21 prominent Islamic militants in Palestinian security
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Twenty-one prominent Islamic militants,
including six involved in the planning of suicide bombings in
Israel, have been recruited by the Palestinian police, a senior
Israeli official said Friday.
	   The information was contained in an intelligence report recently
submitted to the government, said Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan.
	   Palestinian security officials could not immediately be reached
for comment Friday.
	   Israel has long accused the Palestinian Authority of turning a
blind eye to Islamic militants and failing to prevent attacks on
Israel. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has countered that he is
doing the best he can to rein in the militants, but that he cannot
be expected to be successful all of the time.
	   However, Arafat's claim would be seriously undermined if it
turns out that 21 activists of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups
are serving in the Palestinian police force.
	   According to Israeli media reports, confirmed by Bar-Illan, six
of the 21 were involved in plotting three suicide bombings in the
spring of 1996 in which dozens of Israelis were killed.
	   Another three were aides to a top Hamas fugitive, Mohammed Deif,
the reports said. Also serving in the police force are four
militants who were sentenced by Palestinian Authority courts to
jail terms ranging from two to 12 years, but did not have to spend
time in prison.

British powerboat sets new round-world record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GIBRALTAR (AP) _ Beating Jules Verne's fictional target, a
British powerboat set a new round-the-world record time Friday when
it arrived back in Gibraltar after circumnavigating the globe in 74
days, 20 hours and 58 minutes.
	   The 35-meter (115-ft) Cable and Wireless Adventurer left
Gibraltar, on the Iberian peninsula's southern tip, on April 19 and
returned shortly before midday Friday to dash the previous record
of 83 days, nine hours and 54 minutes set in 1960 by the USS
Triton.
	   The vessel had a crew of 14 under project manager Jock Wishart,
46, from Kingston, England, along with skipper Ian Bosworth, 53,
from Falmouth also in England, according to a statement from the
organizers.
	   ``I think we're all a little stunned to actually be here,''
Wishart was quoted as saying. ``It's been a long journey, but we
had the right crew, the right boat, the right designer and the
right support to make this happen.''
	   In its 24,485-mile (39,175-kilometer) voyage, the vessel, built
in Southampton, England, stopped for refueling at 14 ports
including Monte Carlo, Port Said, the Maldives, Singapore, Hong
Kong and Tokyo before setting out across the Pacific.
	   It then went via Honolulu and San Diego before visiting Jamaica,
Miami and New York prior to setting out on the last leg across the
Atlantic.
	   Under international guidelines, the ship had to start and finish
at the same point, pass through both the Suez and Panama canals and
cross all lines of longitude.
	   ``It'll be a hard job to repeat and I hope it means Britain can
keep this world record for a while to come,'' said Wishart.

Austria wants Poland's second phase of EU entry talks this year

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Austria, which just took over the European
Union's rotating presidency, wants to speed the start of in-depth
EU entry talks with Poland, Austria's foreign minister said Friday.
	   The EU is supposed to review Poland's laws and regulations
before beginning the in-depth talks. But that review is scheduled
to last into mid-1999, and Poland is eager to get started this year
on in-depth talks on several issues, including foreign policy and
security.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel supported that aim
Friday.
	   ``We are waiting for the Polish government to present its
negotiating position by the end of September and my task is to
coordinate those positions so that negotiations can begin,''
Schuessel said.
	   Schuessel was on a one-day trip to Poland following his
country's July 1 assumption of the six-month rotating presidency
for the first time since Austria joined in 1995.
	   Schuessel, touring capitals of EU members and candidates, gave
white sport shoes to his Polish counterpart, Bronislaw Geremek, as
a symbol of fast progress towards the EU.
	   Poland said late last month that it plans to be ready to start
detailed negotiations in eight areas: foreign policy, security,
scientific research, industrial policy, telecommunications, culture
and media, small business and education.
	   Polish officials expect those talks to go smoothly, but other
areas, such as heavy industry and agriculture, are expected to be
problematic.
	   Officials in Brussels have indicated Poland could expect to join
the EU in 2003, at the earliest.

British powerboat sets new round-world record

<TEXT>
	   GIBRALTAR (AP) _ Beating Jules Verne's fictional target, a
British powerboat set a new round-the-world record time Friday when
it arrived back in Gibraltar after circumnavigating the globe in 74
days, 20 hours and 58 minutes.
	   The 35-meter (115-ft) Cable and Wireless Adventurer left
Gibraltar, on the Iberian peninsula's southern tip, on April 19 and
returned shortly before midday Friday to dash the previous record
of 83 days, nine hours and 54 minutes set in 1960 by the USS
Triton.
	   The vessel had a crew of 14 under project manager Jock Wishart,
46, from Kingston, England, along with skipper Ian Bosworth, 53,
from Falmouth also in England, according to a statement from the
organizers.
	   ``I think we're all a little stunned to actually be here,''
Wishart was quoted as saying. ``It's been a long journey, but we
had the right crew, the right boat, the right designer and the
right support to make this happen.''
	   In its 24,485-mile (39,175-kilometer) voyage, the vessel, built
in Southampton, England, stopped for refueling at 14 ports
including Monte Carlo, Port Said, the Maldives, Singapore, Hong
Kong and Tokyo before setting out across the Pacific.
	   It then went via Honolulu and San Diego before visiting Jamaica,
Miami and New York prior to setting out on the last leg across the
Atlantic.
	   Under international guidelines, the ship had to start and finish
at the same point, pass through both the Suez and Panama canals and
cross all lines of longitude.
	   ``It'll be a hard job to repeat and I hope it means Britain can
keep this world record for a while to come,'' said Wishart.

Tanker captain pleads guilty in Singapore oil spill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The captain of a tanker involved in Singapore's
worst oil spill pleaded guilty Friday to not doing enough to avoid
the collision that led to the spill, Singapore television reported.
	   In the October 1997 accident, the Cypriot oil tanker Evoikos and
the Thai supertanker Orapin Global collided in the Straits of
Singapore, dumping about 29,000 tons of heavy fuel oil.
	   Michael Chalkitis, the 58-year-old Greek captain of the Evoikos,
pleaded guilty Friday to not acting sufficiently to avoid a
collision and failing to keep a proper lookout, the TV report said.
	   The Polish captain of the Orapin Global, Jan Sokolowski, pleaded
guilty Monday to charges of reckless navigation. Both men will
appear in court again next week for their mitigation pleas before
final sentencing.
	   The guilty plea came as a surprise at the start of what was
planned as a five-week trial, according to the news report.
	   Chalkitis negotiated a plea bargain with the prosecution instead
of contesting the charges, which carry a combined punishment of two
years jail and a 60,000 Singapore dollar (dlrs 35,000) fine.
	   The matter will not end with the two trials. The two ship owners
are claiming damages against one another and the owners of Evoikos'
cargo are also seeking compensation.
	   In addition, there will be claims by various parties such as
Singapore's Maritime and Port Authority for the cost of the
clean-up operation, along with other ships and businesses affected
by the spill.

Lebanon arrests 11 former Christian militiamen for bombings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH PANOSSIAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese security forces have arrested 11
former members of a right-wing Christian militia suspected of
involvement in a series of bombings aimed at destabilizing the
country.
	   A statement issued by security sources and carried by the
official media said the men were behind a 1996 attack against a
Syrian bus that killed its driver and an explosion at the main bus
terminal in downtown Beirut in October 1997 that caused no
casualties.
	   It said the men may also have been behind an attack that
targeted the U.S. Embassy, but left no casualties.
	   The statement did not say when the 11 were arrested.
	   It said, however, that two members of the group were killed in
Beirut on June 12 when a bomb that they were transporting exploded
prematurely.
	   The statement said that an investigation by the Lebanese army's
Intelligence Department revealed that among the 11 men were members
of a 20-member `shock troop'' cell of the former Lebanese Forces
militia that received orders via the internet from a militia office
in Australia.
	   A member of the Lebanese Forces political council in Australia
denied any involvement.
	   ``We have had nothing to do with this matter or any other
matters,'' Tony Chidiac told the Australian Associated Press in
Sydney.
	   The Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia during the
1975-90 civil war, was disbanded by the Syrian-backed government in
1994 and its leaders jailed.
	   During the war, the militia opposed Syrian influence and had
close ties to Israel. Syria maintains some 35,000 soldiers in
Lebanon and is the main power broker in the country.
	   The statement also said the group had planned to assassinate
three unnamed political and security officials.
	   The statement said the acts aimed to destabilize the country and
``the possibility that the perpetrators may have been acting on
instructions from Israeli intelligence agencies is not ruled out.''
	   Lebanese leaders repeatedly have accused Israel and its
supporters of seeking to destabilize Lebanon.
	   Last month, several Lebanese Forces members won seats in
municipal elections in Christian areas. It was their first
political participation after boycotting elections since the end of
the civil war.

World Cup: Dunga, Klinsmann among superstars making international
</HEADLINE>
exit &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ They've lifted World Cups, helped elevate their
countries' soccer to new heights, and one has even been credited
with starting a fad for wild on-pitch hairdos.
	   Now Dunga, Juergen Klinsmann, Gheorghe Hagi, Michael Laudrup and
Carlos Valderrama are all saying goodbye to international soccer at
the World Cup.
	   The five superstars are among a clutch of top players _ which
also include Spanish goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, Colombian
midfielder Freddy Rincon and Belgian captain Franky Van der Elst _
who have decided to quit international soccer at the top.
	   Among them, those eight players have won nearly 1,000 caps and
lifted countless national and international trophies at club level.
	   Brazilian captain Dunga savored the ultimate joy of leading a
team to the World Cup title in 1994.
	   During his long career, the 34-year-old midfield enforcer, who
won his 93rd cap and played his 16th World Cup game in Friday's
quarterfinal against Denmark, has been credited _ and assailed _
for integrating steel into traditional Brazilian flair.
	   ``When I'm wearing the jersey of the selection, I don't feel
pain,'' Dunga said after Brazil's 4-1 second round win over Chile.
``You can kick me, I feel nothing. My leg was full of blood, and I
didn't even notice. I only realized it when the referee stopped the
game to order me off.''
	   Like Dunga, 33-year-old striker Klinsmann, who captained Germany
to European Championship success in 1996, has a World Cup winner's
medal, having been an integral part of Germany's 1990 team.
	   With 46 goals in 106 matches, his strike rate compares to any in
the international scene.
	   After Klinsmann struggled to make an impact in the English
Premier League last season, his place in the World Cup finals was
in doubt.
	   But the striker has been in fine form in France, justifying
coach Berti Vogts' continued faith by netting three times in his
first four outings. That gives Klinsmann 11 World Cup goals in
total, more than any other player at France 98.
	   Skillful left-sided midfielder Hagi, 33, is the biggest soccer
star ever to come out of Romania. He has scored 33 goals in 114
games for his country.
	   ``Romania goes on with or without me. The important thing is to
win,'' said Hagi, wiping away tears, as he spoke Thursday to a
crowd of 10,000 who roared his name at a soccer stadium in
Bucharest.
	   But the man nicknamed ``the Maradona of the Carpathians'' isn't
leaving football completely, having vowed to fight corruption in
Romanian football.
	   Laudrup, another creative midfield player, also became a
superstar despite coming from a country that rarely hits the
international heights.
	   The 34-year-old Dane has scored 37 goals in 102 games for his
country, and has an unmatched record of winning league titles with
four different European powerhouses, Juventus of Turin, Barcelona,
Real Madrid and Ajax.
	   Laudrup helped steer Denmark to a quarterfinal clash against
Brazil with two goal-making passes against Nigeria.
	   ``It could be a fantastic ending for me,'' Laudrup said before
Friday's match. ``First, winning the double in the Netherlands with
Ajax and now to be in the quarterfinal. It's a fantastic result for
Denmark already.''
	   Laudrup, too, might not be finished with soccer altogether.
	   ``First, I will rest for a few months, but I'm only retiring
from professional football,'' he said. ``Maybe I'll regret it. You
never know. I can't say because I have never quit before.''
	   Valderrama, the 36-year-old midfielder for the Miami Fusion of
the Major League Soccer in the United States, might be best
remembered around the world for his dyed-orange bouffant locks,
which he displayed long before the current fad for outlandish
hairdos.
	   But players and coaches say that would be an injustice for a
player who has been central to lifting the status of Colombian
football on the world stage, scoring 12 goals and creating dozens
more in 110 games for his country.
	   ``Carlos is like the perfume that one wears and that people come
to know you for,'' said Francisco Maturana, the former national
coach. ``It's intelligence, mental quickness. He may have a lot of
defects, but I can only think of his virtues.''

Yeltsin says tax payments needed to break `vicious cycle'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new graf 4 with new tax threats against Gazprom,
Duma asks for debt resettlement bill in grafs 14-15, EDITS to
trim. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) - President Boris Yeltsin urged Russia's largest
company Friday to help break the ``vicious cycle'' of non-payments
and hand over hundreds of millions of dollars in back taxes.
	   Yeltsin's comments came a day after the government touched off a
controversy by threatening to seize assets from Gazprom if the huge
gas monopoly didn't pay its overdue taxes.
	   During a meeting Friday, Yeltsin gave Gazprom head Rem Vyakhirev
one day to present a detailed payment schedule, presidential
spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
	   Tax officials also came down hard on Gazprom, warning Friday
that sanctions would be imposed on the monopoly if it does not
settle its debts to the government by August 1, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   The government's inability to collect taxes is one of its most
enduring problems, and the decision to target Gazprom has set up a
showdown between the government and what is perhaps the country's
most powerful company.
	   But Vyakhirev complained to Yeltsin that Gazprom often gets paid
months late, if at all, by its customers, which include many
government entities. As a result, it has difficulty paying its
taxes on time.
	   All companies ``must pay fully, irrespective of what is paid to
them,'' ITAR-Tass quoted Yeltsin as telling Vyakhirev. ``Otherwise,
we get a vicious cycle.''
	   Yastrzhembsky described the meeting as ``a rather hard
conversation.''
	   ``The president suggested that a complete solution to the
situation be worked out in one day,'' the spokesman said.
	   The government said Gazprom owes 4 billion rubles (about dlrs
750 million) in taxes each month, plus an unspecified sum in
outstanding tax debts. But the government appears to be willing to
write off at least some of the existing mutual debts.
	   Vyakhirev, who was on a business trip to Vienna, rushed back to
Moscow on Friday morning to meet with Yeltsin. Afterward, he still
seemed less than pleased, calling the controversy ``a
provocation.''
	   ``I believe that someone has done wrong in this case,''
Vyakhirev said.
	   Many opposition lawmakers seemed to agree with the Gazprom
chief. Many Communists immediately objected to government's
threats, denouncing the move as an effort to destroy one of the
country's remaining economic treasures.
	   On Friday the State Duma also began working on a resolution
designed to prevent similar confrontations, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The document urges the government to develop a procedure for
debt settlements between state-funded companies and monopolies like
Gazprom. It also recommends that the government resist reorganizing
the country's monopolies.
	   Gazprom, which has close to 400,000 employees, controls
production and distribution of Russia's vast natural gas supplies,
and is one of Western Europe's largest suppliers.

Delian lions replaced to stop further damage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Archeologists will replace the famous
marble lions of Delos with copies to prevent the 2,600-year-old
statues from suffering further damage from the elements, officials
said Friday.
	   Delos was one of the holiest sites of ancient Greece, boasting
the famous Temple of Apollo, the sun god, and the treasury of the
Delian League. Thousands of tourists every year visit the small
uninhabited Aegean island about 150 kilometers (93 miles) southeast
of Athens.
	   Government archaeologists said that sun, salt and wind were
slowly destroying the lion statues, which were a gift from the
citizens of the nearby island of Naxos.
	   The seven remaining lions will be exhibited in the small Delos
museum and silicon copies will take their place outdoors.
Antiquities officials plan to visit Delos next week, but it was not
known how long it would take to make the copies.
	   Ancient sources mention 16 lion statues. Besides the seven
complete statues, three fragments exist in Greece. Another complete
lion is in Venice, Italy.

World Cup: Owen could become soccer's first billionaire player
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England's 18-year-old World Cup star Michael Owen
could become soccer's first billionaire, the Daily Mirror reported
Friday.
	   The Mirror estimated the value of Owen, who scored one of the
most spectacular goals of the tournament during England's
second-round loss to Argentina, had soared to at least 50 million
pounds (dlrs 83 million).
	   The paper quoted Peter Draper, a spokesman for sportswear
manufacturer Umbro, as saying Owen could become a billionaire.
	   Umbro signed Owen to a six-year deal three weeks ago, when the
Liverpool star was not even a starter in Glenn Hoddle's World Cup
team.
	   ``It is possible (Owen) could be the `Michael Jordan' of
football,'' Draper said, refering to comparisons between the
striker and the Chicargo Bulls superstar.
	   ``It is that boy next door image image that promises to be his
passport to the biggest fortune in footballing history,'' Draper
added.
	   The Mirror also quoted leading soccer agent Pine Zaravi as
saying he was asked to put a value on Owen last year by Italian
team AC Milan.
	   ``There was unofficial interest from Milan and they would not
have hesitated in paying 27 million pounds (dlrs 44.8 million) in
fee and salary,'' he said.
	   Zaravi said the asking price for Owen would have to start at 50
million pounds (dlrs 83 million) since the World Cup.

	   GIBRALTAR (AP) _ Beating Jules Verne's fictional target, a

U.N. envoy in second round of talks on Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A senior U.N. envoy began a second round
of talks Friday with the leaders of this war-divided island's Greek
and Turkish communities to try and break the deadlock in talks
aimed at reuniting Cyprus.
	   Little is expected to come out of the visit by Diego Cordovez, a
former Ecuadorian foreign minister who gained international fame
when he negotiated the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan
in 1988.
	   ``We believe the talks will be useful but we are not
anticipating any significant outcome,'' Cypriot Foreign Minister
Yiannakis Cassoulides said Thursday.
	   Cordovez arrived in Cyprus on Thursday and has since met twice
with President Glafcos Clerides, whose Greek Cypriot government is
the island's only internationally recognized administration.
	   He also met with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash yesterday
and was due to meet him again Friday night over a working dinner.
	   Cordovez, who was last in Cyprus in March, has so far declined
to make any statement to reporters on the substance of his talks,
but was due to address a news conference on Saturday.
	   The island's Greek and Turkish communities have been living
apart since Turkey invaded the island in 1974, with a
U.N.-patrolled buffer zone running across the island separating
them.
	   The invasion followed a short-lived coup in Nicosia by
supporters of union with Greece. Turkey has since kept about 35,000
troops in the northern third of the island it occupies and where
the self-styled Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus was declared in
1983. Only Ankara recognizes it.
	   Repeated international attempts to solve the Cyprus problem have
failed and Denktash now maintains that he will not resume talks
with Clerides until his state is recognized and the island
withdraws its bid to join the European Union. Both conditions have
been rejected by the Greek Cypriots.

Polish aristocrats say ownership claim neglected by Washington

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Heirs of Polish aristocrats who say they
own the U.S. Embassy grounds in Warsaw charged Friday that
Washington was ignoring their claim and vowed to step up the
pressure.
	   The case concerns the palace of the late Princess Roza
Czetwertynska, which stood on the central Warsaw site until 1960,
when the United States tore it down to build an embassy. Poland's
communist government in 1956 leased the property to the United
States for 80 years, with an option to extend the lease for an
additional 20 years.
	   Last August, descendants of the Czetwertynski family picketed
the U.S. Embassy and delivered a letter asking for a meeting.
	   Addressing a news conference Friday, Albert Czetwertynski, a
grandson of the late princess, said the family never received an
answer.
	   ``This is very impolite,'' he said. ``The U.S. government did
not even acknowledge receiving the letter.''
	   U.S. diplomats were unavailable for comment Friday as the
embassy was closed for a holiday. But in a statement last year, the
embassy said the property was legally acquired and that the
Czetwertynski family should address its claim to Polish
authorities.
	   Czetwertynski said family members, living in the United States,
Canada, Switzerland and Belgium, will send letters to governments
and political leaders to step up pressure.
	   He said they still wanted to talk with American officials to
discuss compensation for the property, worth millions of dollars.
``Any offer by the U.S. government will be treated very
seriously.''
	   The family also plans to take action against the Polish
government to demand restoration of ownership. The case is among
dozens of claims by former owners of Warsaw properties that were
nationalized by communist authorities in the late 1940s and early
1950s.
	   Nine years after the fall of communism, Poland still has no law
for settling claims of private property taken over by the
communists, but several buildings have recently been returned to
old owners who took their case to court.

Andrew Croft, British Arctic explorer, dead at 91
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Andrew Croft, a pioneering Arctic explorer and
renowned expert on cold-weather warfare, has died at age 91.
	   After battling the elements in icy northern explorations _ and
later the Germans in World War II and the Russians and North
Koreans in the Cold War _ the British Army colonel earned an
international reputation as a leader in special operations.
	   In 1933, he joined the longest self-supporting dog sled
expedition ever, trekking across Greenland with explorer Martin
Lindsay. Originally greeted with skepticism, the trip eventually
made history.
	   Several years later, he returned to the northern region _ this
time, to the island of Nordauslandet 600 miles from the North Pole
_ on an Oxford University expedition. Croft then studied reindeer
in the Swedish Lapland.
	   When World War II broke out in 1939, Croft's knowledge of cold
climates proved an invaluable asset during assignments in Norway
and the Shetland Islands, defending against the Germans. In 1941,
he worked as a special operations executive, an
intelligence-gathering job, in Stockholm.
	   On the Mediterranean front, Croft's commando units bombarded the
coasts of France and Italy. In recognition of his courage and
planning during these raids, he earned the Distinguished Service
Order, a British award for gallantry.
	   As the start of the Cold War in the late 1940s heralded new
challenges for Western armies unaccustomed to the long, cold
winters in the Soviet Union and North Korea, Croft led training
operations in Canada, where conditions matched those in the East.
	   In 1960, as commandant of the London Metropolitan Police Cadet
Corps, he returned to the civilian life he had left in the '30s _
once again as an instructor. Before his military career, he had
helped found Stowe, a British school, and taught at a preparatory
school.
	   Queen Elizabeth II appointed Croft an Officer of the British
Empire in 1970 for his work with young soldiers.
	   In 1991, he wrote an autobiography, ``A Talent for Adventure.''
	   Croft, who died June 26, is survived by three daughters. Funeral
arrangements were unknown.

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Heavy rain washed out the one-day
international cricket match between New Zealand and India at the
Sinhalese Sports Club ground in Colombo Friday.
	   New Zealand, who won the toss and batted first, were 128 for 5
in 31.1 overs when the downpour began.
	   Each team was awarded a point after the umpires decided to
abandon the match which began 30 minutes late.
	   India and Sri Lanka have six points each but India has qualified
for the finals because of a better run rate.
	   New Zealand has four points and will play their last match
against Sri Lanka, ranked second in the series, on Sunday. Should
New Zealand win the match, both teams will have six points and the
finalist will have to be decided on the basis of a better run rate.
	   The final is scheduled for July 7, a day-night match at the
Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.

Euro Disney and strikers' representatives meet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Euro Disney and representatives of striking workers
held talks Friday aimed at ending a nine-day walkout that has
disrupted the theme park's popular parade of Disney figures.
	   After restaurant workers, it was the cleaners' turn to join
technicians and parade performers in their walkout at Disneyland
Paris, 30 kilometers (18 miles) east of Paris.
	   Since the strike began, about 40 strikers have sat outside the
park's entrance each day, holding banners. The strikers' main
demand is a 7 percent increase in salary.
	   Disneyland officials say such an increase is out of the
question, saying workers have received an 8 percent rise over the
last three years.
	   Euro Disney, the holding company that is 39 percent owned by the
Walt Disney Co. in Burbank, California, opened the park's doors in
April 1992.
	   It reported annual profit since 1995, in part by imposing
tougher cost controls that have triggered occasional strikes.

Court rules Ford's name choice violates magazine's rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ A court ruled Friday that Ford's German
subsidiary may not use Focus as a brand name because it would
infringe on the rights of the German newsmagazine of that name.
	   Ford itself brought the issue before the state court in Cologne,
hoping to deflect any lawsuit over its choice of Focus as a name
for the successor to its Fiesta model.
	   The court said Ford would unfairly benefit from the
name-recognition and success of Munich-based Focus magazine by
using that name. The ruling applies only in Germany.
	   Ford planned to start selling cars worldwide this fall under the
Focus name, after applying in Germany and elsewhere in 1995 for the
right to use the name for automobiles.
	   Ford spokesman Wolfgang Sander said the company may try to come
to an agreement with the magazine on the name, and also was
considering whether to take the issue to a higher court.
	   Sander said it was too early to say whether Ford would sell cars
abroad under the Focus name even if it cannot in Germany.
	   Focus editor Helmut Markwort greeted the ruling. ``This ruling
clarifies that nobody can hang themselves on to the success of
Focus,'' he said.
	   Focus is Germany's second-most popular weekly news magazine
behind Hamburg-based Der Spiegel.

Activists win temporary custody of four circus lions

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Four circus lions so infirm they can barely
chew their meat had a home for the time being in a national park
after animal rights activists won a temporary custody battle.
	   The Bombay High Court ruled Thursday that the female lions aged
10 to 17 years, three of them blind and the fourth pregnant, should
stay at the national park until pending criminal trials of the
circus owners, who are accused of mistreating the animals. The
Great Golden Circus had demanded the lions be returned pending
trial.
	   The lions have been in the park in northern Bombay since Oct.
30, when the animal rights group Ahimsa complained to authorities
that they were being forced to perform despite weak health and that
they had been beaten and denied proper food.
	   If convicted, the circus could lose the lions and lose the right
to keep any more animals. Great Golden officials have denied
mistreating the lions.
	   Park authorities said Friday that the four lions were gaining
strength.
	   ``They are eating better now. They were very weak when they came
here. Now at least they are moving around a little,'' said Suresh
Gairola.
	   When the lions arrived at the park along with two others who
have since died, they were too weak to stand. They were put in
enclosures because they were too ill to fend for themselves in the
park's open spaces.
	   The lions' meat still has to be cut into bite-size pieces. Their
teeth are weak and rotten, apparently due to years of malnutrition.
	   Big cats draw crowds to Indian circuses, where they are made to
jump through burning hoops or balance on small stools. Animal
rights activists say circus owners torture and starve the animals
to get them to perform.
	   Satnam Ahuja, of the Ahimsa group, said she saw one of the lions
being whipped and beaten about the face with a metal road during a
performance in Bombay in October.
	   Beatings, malnutrition and exposure to floodlights may have
resulted in blindness for three of the lions, Ahimsa said.

Fighters beat Lions 5-2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Pitcher Hiroyuki Sekine notched his league-leading
seventh win as the Pacific League's front-running Nippon Ham
Fighters downed the Seibu Lions 5-2 Friday at Tokyo Dome.
	   With the bases loaded in the 1st, the Fighters scored three runs
after Seibu catcher Tsutomu Ito made a wild throw to first base
going for a double play off a grounder by outfielder Nigel Wilson.
	   Seibu slugger Domingo Martinez, formerly with Triple-A in
Rochester, slammed his 16th home run of the season in the 7th.
	   Sekine struck out four over seven plus innings to improve to
7-4.
	   Wilson played formerly with the Cleveland Indians.
	   At Green Stadium Kobe, Harvey Jerome Pulliam Jr. smashed a solo
home run in the 3rd as the Orix BlueWave beat the Kintetsu
Buffaloes 7-2.
	   Orix Hurler Nobuyuki Hoshino pitched six full innings to pick up
his fourth win against eight losses. Former Seattle Mariner Edwin
Hurtado pitched three scoreless innings of relief for his sixth
save.
	   At Chiba Marine Stadium, the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks edged the Lotte
Marines 4-3 for their third victory in a row.
	   In the Central League, former Chicago Cub Dave Hansen batted in
runs in the 1st and the 5th as the Hanshin Tigers beat the
Hiroshima Carp 4-1 at Kurashiki.
	   Hanshin slugger Alonzo Powell, formerly with the Seattle
Mariners, hit a two-run double in the 9th to seal the victory for
the Tigers.
	   Tigers hurler Keiichi Yabu pitched a three-hitter over eight
innings for his fifth win against four losses.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Scorching North African winds swept over
Greece and Italy on Friday, pushing temperatures as high as 45
degrees Celsius (113 degrees F) and killing at least 10 people.
	   Temperatures were not expected to drop until the end of the
weekend and hospitals in both countries were placed on full alert
to deal with the blistering heat wave.
	   ``Hot air masses in the lower atmosphere from North Africa are
at their maximum transfer rate,'' said meteorologist Nikos
Kanderes. ``The first strong heat wave of the year will be history
on Sunday.''
	   A combination of high temperatures and little wind pushed air
pollution levels beyond danger levels in the mountain-ringed Athens
basin, sending hundreds of people to hospitals suffering from heat
stroke and exhaustion. Officials said air pollution levels had hit
their highest point in two years.
	   Temperatures in Athens climbed as high as 44 degrees Celsius
(111 F) and 45 degrees Celsius (113 F) in the southern city of
Argos. On Thursday, the thermometer soared to to 48 degrees Celsius
(118 F) in Catania, Italy. Rome has sweltered under 37 degree
weather (99 F) most of the week.
	   The Mediterranean island of Malta, located in the path of the
Saharan winds, also broiled under 43-degree Celsius (110-F)
temperatures.
	   At least four deaths in Greece were blamed on the weather,
including a 3-year-old boy who died of heat stroke in the
southwestern port of Patras and an illegal Albanian immigrant who
collapsed crossing the border.
	   In Italy, at least six deaths were attributed to the heat, news
reports said. They included an 18-month-old boy left inside a
camper in the sun in Rome.
	   In southern Italy, two fire fighters suffered burns trying to
put out some of the blazes fanned by the hot winds. Fires also
broke out in several regions of Greece.
	   In Athens, health officials appealed for people to restrict
their movements and stay out of the sun. State and municipal
authorities also set up special air-conditioned rooms for elderly
people and those with respiratory problems to cope with the heat.
	   Greece's public power company also warned of sporadic
electricity shortages around this capital of nearly 5 million
people because of increased use of air conditioners.
	   Electricity consumption broke all records Thursday and Friday in
Greece. High consumption blacked out nearly half the capital
earlier this week.
	   Some astrophysicists in Greece blamed the increased heat on an
11-year sun cycle that increases the amount of solar radiation
reaching the earth.
	   ``We've also found that the hole in the ozone layer and the
temperature of the earth correspondingly change every 11 years,''
Xenophon Mousas, head of the Astrophysics Lab at Athens University,
told the daily Exousia.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Black flags hung from buildings Friday
and flowers and candles were laid at the site of a car bombing that
ripped through a busy downtown street the previous day, killing
four people and injuring two dozen.
	   The target of the bomb was a businessman whom police said had
criminal links and may have been killed because he was an informer.
Jozsef Karoly Boros, 42, had survived four previous attempts on his
life.
	   But the bomb also shocked Hungarians for having killed innocent
bystanders _ two men and a woman _ and sent 13 to the hospital for
treatment of their injuries. Sixteen cars were damaged, two of
which caught on fire from the heat of the blast, and the bomb was
so powerful that car parts were found on top of a six-story
building.
	   ``Underworld declares war on Hungary,'' read the banner headline
of the Blikk daily on Friday. ``Enough!'' cried another, Mai Nap
(Today), referring to the series of gang-related bombings in recent
months.
	   ``Before at least they were just killing each other,'' said a
54-year-old Budapest resident, Lujza Oeri, referring to 16 previous
bombings this year. ``Maybe now they (authorities) will finally do
something.''
	   Police said Boros was walking down a street and as he approached
a booby-trapped Fiat car his cell phone rang. He slowed to answer
the phone and the bomb was set off by remote control.
	   Police were seeking three people in possible connection with the
bombing and interviewed 58 witnesses through the night, spokesman
Zoltan Sagi said.
	   ``It was a professional job,'' Laszlo Forgacs, the head of
national police, told reporters.
	   Boros was known to police for his involvement in various
criminal activities involving millions of dollars, and also as one
of their informers.
	   ``He provided us with valuable information on underworld
circles,'' Budapest Police Chief Attila Berta said. He added that
``being an informer was also a cover for his own criminal
activities.''
	   Berta said five or six criminal groups wanted to prevent Boros
from giving evidence against them.
	   ``This is a defeat for the police in the fight against organized
crime,'' he said.

Khmer Rouge leader splits with comrades, talks with govt: Aide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A faction of the fading Khmer Rouge
rebel movement led by veteran Khieu Samphan has been holding talks
with the Cambodian government after splitting with the other two
top leaders still at large, an aide to Khieu Samphan said.
	   Tep Khunnal, interviewed inside Cambodia near the Thai border,
said that representatives of Khieu Samphan's so-called National
Solidarity Party met Thursday and Friday with emissaries of the
government of strongman Hun Sen.
	   He told Associated Press Television that previous meetings had
been held between the two sides, but divulged few details.
	   ``We have told them our stands, including general principles and
small details. I don't know if Phnom Penh will accept or not,''
said Tep Khunnal.
	   He also said Ta Mok and Nuon Chea _ the only other major
guerrilla leaders still holding out after mass defections to the
government over the past two years _ had ``decided to leave our
organization.''
	   ``They have no more roles,'' Tep Khunnal said. ``Now they are
safe, and live in an area with tight security. We did not arrest
them or put them on trial.''
	   A Thai military source familiar with Khmer Rouge activities
confirmed Friday that Khieu Samphan had split with Ta Mok and Nuon
Chea, whom he said were protected by only about 100 guerrillas.
	   The officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, could not
confirm that talks were being held between Khieu Samphan's faction
and the Phnom Penh government.
	   Phnom Penh maintains it wants to try Ta Mok, Nuon Chea and Khieu
Samphan for crimes against humanity during the Khmer Rouge regime,
which caused the deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians between
1975 and 1979.
	   Ta Mok took over from the group's notorious leader, Pol Pot, in
a bloody power struggle last year. Nuon Chea was long considered
the number-two leader of the Maoist-inspired revolutionary group.
	   Khieu Samphan, viewed as one of the leading intellectuals, has
traditionally been the public face of the group.
	   Pol Pot died in mid-April of a heart attack while being held as
a prisoner by his comrades, who were fleeing a government offensive
that captured their last stronghold.
	   The government last month hinted of contacts with Khieu Samphan,
when Hun Sen said that if he helped capture the other two longtime
Khmer Rouge leaders, ``We will forgive'' him.
	   But Hun Sen later indicated Khieu Samphan, who never had armed
clout in the movement, would be unlikely to cooperate and it would
be better to capture him.
	   The purported talks suggest Khieu Samphan may be trying to
defect. If he succeeds, he would be the highest-ranking Khmer Rouge
to give up since the former foreign minister, Ieng Sary, did so in
1996.
	   Ieng Sary is widely believed to have played an important role in
the group's genocidal policies, but he received a royal pardon in
exchange for leading thousands of war-weary guerrillas to peace.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The father of the man who claimed to
be a nuclear scientist with secret information about Pakistan's
nuclear program said Friday that his son was an accountant at a
company that makes ceramic tiles and bathroom fixtures.
	   In an interview with Pakistan's state-run television, Sikander
Khan said his son, Iftikhar Chaudhary Khan, was not a scientist.
	   ''He never worked as a scientist,'' Khan told Pakistan
Television. ''He was a business commerce student. He didn't study
science.''
	   In interviews in the United States, Khan claimed to be a nuclear
scientist who attended a secret meeting where Pakistan mapped out
plans to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against its uneasy
neighbor India.
	   He said he fled to the United States to protest his country's
plan to be the first to use nuclear weapons. He also promised to
hand over documents to substantiate his claims after being granted
asylum.
	   ''He worked four years as an accountant,'' said his father.
	   Meanwhile, Pakistan urged both Canada and the United States to
investigate how Khan was able to get visas ``when genuine
applicants face hardships getting visas to Western countries.''
	   Information Minister Mushahid Hussein, whose comments were
carried by the state-run news agency, also said that the Pakistani
government would conduct an investigation of its own.
	   Asad Gulzar Sheikh, director of Forte Trading Company (Pvt)
Limited, said Thursday that he was Khan's boss for four years until
November 1997, when Khan resigned.
	   Sheikh said Khan was an assistant accountant who earned 5,000
rupees a month, the equivalent of dlrs 120, when he quit his job.
It wasn't immediately clear why he resigned.
	   ''The concerned countries should hold an inquiry as to how a
trickster got a visa when genuine applicants face hardships in
getting visas for Western countries,'' the Associated Press of
Pakistan quoted Hussein as saying.
	   ''How did he get access to the world media and hire an attorney
in the United States?'' asked Hussein. ''These are points that
ought to be pondered by the concerned countries.''
	   Hussein called Khan's allegations ''a false story aimed at
maligning Pakistan and exacerbating tension in the region.''
	   India and Pakistan both conducted underground nuclear tests in
May sparking fears of a nuclear arms race on the Asian
subcontinent, an area that has seen three wars in the last 51
years.
	   Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub dismissed as ''nonsense''
Khan's allegation that Pakistan was planning a first strike against
India.
	   The government also said that scientists are not involved in
meetings to map out combat strategy.
	   On Thursday, the U.S. State Department said it had no
information to support Khan's claims.
	   ''We do note significant discrepancies in his story as reported
in the press,'' said State Department spokesman James Rubin,
declining to elaborate.
	   The U.S. State Department has no information to support Khan's
claim that Pakistan was planning a pre-emptive strike on Indian
nuclear facilities, Rubin said.

Police investigating Seychelles opposition leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA, Seychelles (AP) _ Police are investigating the
official leader of the opposition in parliament for allegedly
delivering a speech without a permit, an officer said Friday.
	   Wavel Ramkalawan is alleged to have addressed supporters June
29, Seychelles independence day, at a picnic on the Indian Ocean
beach, the officer said on condition he was not identified further.
	   Seychelles law requires politicians to get a police permit to
address a public rally.
	   The heavy-handed police treatment of Ramkalawan appears to be
part of a systematic effort by President Albert Rene's government
to frustrate the opposition.
	   Many of the privileges enjoyed by the former leader of
opposition, including unhindered access to the state-owned
Seychelles Broadcasting Corp., were withdrawn after March general
elections in the Indian Ocean archipelago nation.
	   Rene defeated Ramkalawan in the presidential race and his party,
Seychelles People's Progressive Front, won 25 of the 26 directly
elected seats.
	   The party was also entitled to six of nine seats distributed
proportionately.
	   Despite the victory, Rene was disappointed Ramkalawan's United
Opposition party increased its share of the popular vote from 8
percent in 1993 to 26 percent.
	   Also Rene resents replacement of the less aggressive James
Mancham as leader of the opposition by the more combative
Ramkalawan.
	   The four opposition legislators in the 35-member parliament have
repeatedly boycotted parliamentary sessions to protest what they
say is government harassment.

Two die as heat wave sweeps Japan

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Temperatures soared over 38 degrees Celsius (100
degrees Fahrenheit) on Friday as a heat wave hit Japan, reportedly
causing two deaths and putting 60 people in the hospital.
	   National broadcaster NHK said a 58-year-old man died in the city
of Noda in Chiba prefecture north of Tokyo after being overcome by
heat while walking in a public park.
	   A 90-year-old woman was found by neighbors after she collapsed
in a rice field in the town of Yoshimi in Saitama prefecture
outside the capital. She was taken to a hospital where she was
pronounced dead, NHK said.
	   Police in both cities could not confirm the deaths.
	   Across Japan more than 60 people were taken to hospitals with
symptoms of heat exhaustion, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   Temperatures in Tokyo and surrounding areas hit highs for the
year, with the city of Maebashi in Gunma Prefecture, 100 kilometers
(63 miles) north of Tokyo, registering a sizzling 38.7 degrees
celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the Meteorological
Agency.
	   The temperature in Tokyo reached hit 34.4 degrees Celsius (94

U.N. appeals to Guinea's president for access to refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N.'s top refugee official on Friday appealed
to Guinea to give aid agencies access to some 150,000 Sierra
Leonean refugees cut off for almost three weeks.
	   Aid deliveries have been barred from the area southwest of the
town of Gueckedou, on Guinea's border with Sierra Leone, with
authorities citing security concerns.
	   In a letter to Guinea's President Lansana Conte, U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata called for renewed access to
the refugees on ``strictly humanitarian grounds.''
	   ``The refugees' situation is all the more preoccupying because
they arrived in Guinea in very poor health,'' Ogata said.
	   Malnutrition and death rates, especially among young children,
were already very high before food, water and medical care was cut
off, UNHCR said in a statement.
	   ``Many of those crossing into Guinea in the last weeks had not
received a first food ration when aid was blocked'' on June 15, it
added.
	   The decision halted work on clean water supplies and latrines,
``raising the risk of disease in dozens of sites.''
	   Around 250,000 Sierra Leoneans have fled to neighboring Guinea
and Liberia so far this year, UNHCR says. In all, Guinea has some
300,000 refugees from years of fighting in Sierra Leone.
	   Thousands of villagers in Sierra Leone have lost limbs and
others have been killed in attacks apparently being carried out by
former junta troops seeking revenge for their ouster from the
capital, Freetown, by a Nigerian-led West African force in
February.
	   That allowed elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah to return from
months in exile after Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma took power in a
bloody May 1997 coup.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Scorching North African winds swept over
Greece and Italy on Friday, pushing temperatures as high as 45 C
(113 F) and killing at least 10 people.
	   Temperatures were not expected to drop until the end of the
weekend and hospitals in both countries were on full alert.
	   A combination of high temperatures and little wind pushed air
pollution levels into danger levels in the mountain-ringed Athens
basin, sending hundreds of people to hospitals suffering from heat
stroke and exhaustion. Officials said air pollution levels had hit
their highest point in two years.
	   Temperatures in Athens climbed as high as 44 C (111 F) and 45 C
(113 F) in the southern city of Argos. On Thursday, the thermometer
soared to to 48 C (118 F) in Catania, Italy. Rome sweltered under
37 C (99 F) most of the week.
	   The Mediterranean island of Malta, located in the path of the
Saharan winds, also broiled under 43 C (110 F) temperatures.
	   At least four deaths in Greece were blamed on the weather,
including a 3-year-old boy who died of heat stroke in the
southwestern port of Patras and an illegal Albanian immigrant who
collapsed crossing the border.
	   In Italy, at least six deaths were attributed to the heat, news
reports said. They included an 18-month-old boy left inside a
camper in the sun in Rome.
	   In southern Italy, two firefighters suffered burns trying to put
out some of the blazes fanned by the hot winds. Fires also broke
out in several regions of Greece.
	   ``Hot air masses in the lower atmosphere from North Africa are
at their maximum transfer rate,'' said meteorologist Nikos
Kanderes. ``The first strong heat wave of the year will be history
on Sunday.''

	   Temperatures in Athens climbed as high as 44 C (111 F) and 45 C
(113 F) in the southern city of Argos. On Thursday, the thermometer
soared to to 48 C (118 F) in Catania, Italy. Rome sweltered under
37 C (99 F) most of the week.
	   The Mediterranean island of Malta, located in the path of the
Saharan winds, also broiled under 43 C (110 F) temperatures.
	   At least four deaths in Greece were blamed on the weather,
including a 3-year-old boy who died of heat stroke in the
southwestern port of Patras and an illegal Albanian immigrant who
collapsed crossing the border.
	   In Italy, at least six deaths were attributed to the heat, news
reports said. They included an 18-month-old boy left inside a
camper in the sun in Rome.
	   In southern Italy, two firefighters suffered burns trying to put
out some of the blazes fanned by the hot winds. Fires also broke
out in several regions of Greece.
	   ``Hot air masses in the lower atmosphere from North Africa are
at their maximum transfer rate,'' said meteorologist Nikos
Kanderes. ``The first strong heat wave of the year will be history
on Sunday.''

Conference highlights worldwide chasm in availability of AIDS care
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL Q. HANEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ ``Bridging the gap,'' read signs draped everywhere
around the 12th World AIDS Conference. But by meeting's end Friday,
the message to many seemed just the opposite: The chasm between
haves and have-nots in fighting the global epidemic is only
widening.
	   Around the world, nearly 34 million people are infected with
HIV. Since the international meeting began Monday, about 100,000
more caught the virus.
	   Perhaps 4 percent live in the United States, Western Europe and
a few other places where patients routinely get the powerful AIDS
medicines that can keep the virus in check.
	   ``Medical advances present us with a painful paradox,'' said
Anna Luisa Liguori, who works with the MacArthur Foundation in
Mexico. ``The greater the advances in clinical research, the
greater the gap between those who can afford the best treatment and
those who can afford no treatment at all.''
	   Treating just one person with the standard triple combinations
of drugs costs dlrs 10,000 or more. According to one estimate at
the meeting, making these available worldwide would cost dlrs 36.5
billion, two-thirds of that in Africa.
	   ``Bridge the gap?'' asked Dodji Mathey of Togo. ``I don't think
so. It is not possible for the new medicines to ever get to Africa.
We are too poor.''
	   Among the meeting's 13,371 attendees, less than one-quarter were
_ like Mathey _ from the parts of the world were many children die
because of lack of basic antibiotics and even clean drinking water.
	   Where he lives, 9 percent of adults are infected with HIV. In
some African countries, the figures approach 30 percent.
	   With no effective AIDS vaccine close to development, the only
way to stop the epidemic in these places is to keep people from
getting infected. The primary approach is to make condoms cheap and
abundant and to convince people to use them.
	   Mathey paid his own way to the conference to present data on a
program he runs in Lome, the capital. It educates scooter taxi
drivers to chat up their passengers about condoms. But he could not
pull together the dlrs 20,000 in Geneva that he needs to keep the
effort going.
	   In at least one area, though, the benefits of AIDS drug research
may make its way to the world's poorest. Giving the drug AZT to
infected women during pregnancy helps keep them from passing HIV to
their babies during birth.
	   Studies at the conference show that dlrs 50 worth of the
medicine cuts this risk in half. During the meeting, the United
Nations AIDS program said it would start a pilot program to bring
AZT to about 30,000 women in poor countries in Asia, Africa and
South America.
	   However, AZT alone cannot stop all the 1,600 cases of
mother-to-child transmission that occur daily, almost entirely in
the developing world. Infected mothers have about a 10 percent
chance of passing the virus to their babies during breast feeding.
	   Just over 40 percent of the speakers at the conference were from
poor countries, and they were given prominent spots on the program.
However, during closing ceremonies Friday, Dr. Richard Horton,
editor of the British journal The Lancet, chastised attendees for
sometimes failing to sit through those talks.
	   ``Why is it that whenever speakers from a developing country
rose to speak about these issues, the halls began to bleed
delegates?'' he asked. ``Why should any government bother to listen
if you don't?''
	   At the next world AIDS meeting, in 2000, the contrast between
wealthy and developing countries is likely to be even more
apparent. It will be held in Durban, South Africa.
	   Dr. Hoosen Coovadia, the chairman of that meeting, said that at
the largely black King Edward VIII Hospital, where he works in
Durban, about 40 percent of the patients have HIV. None of them
receive virus-fighting medicines.

Yemeni pipeline dynamited, spilling oil into Arabian Sea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ Unknown assailants dynamited an oil pipeline
in the southern city of Aden Friday, causing an oil spill in the
Arabian Sea, a security official said.
	   Authorities switched off the pipeline immediately after the
explosion, preventing an extensive spill, said the officials,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity. They would not give
an estimate of the damage, however.
	   Police were questioning 18 people, including a number of
fishermen, in connection with the early morning blast which only
ruptured the pipeline, the officials said.
	   The pipeline stretches 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) from Aden's oil
refinery to its port.
	   Yemen is still reeling from a 1994 civil war that nearly tore
apart the union reached in 1990 between the conservative north and
the socialist south. The government says subsequent acts of
violence were directed from abroad, but it has not named any
country.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Temperatures soared over 38 degrees Celsius (100
degrees Fahrenheit) on Friday as a heat wave hit Japan, reportedly
causing two deaths and putting 60 people in the hospital.
	   National broadcaster NHK said a 58-year-old man died in the city
of Noda in Chiba prefecture north of Tokyo after being overcome by
heat while walking in a public park.
	   A 90-year-old woman was found by neighbors after she collapsed
in a rice field in the town of Yoshimi in Saitama prefecture
outside the capital. She was taken to a hospital where she was
pronounced dead, NHK said.
	   Police in both cities could not confirm the deaths.
	   Across Japan more than 60 people were taken to hospitals with
symptoms of heat exhaustion, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   Temperatures in Tokyo and surrounding areas hit highs for the
year, with the city of Maebashi in Gunma Prefecture, 100 kilometers
(63 miles) north of Tokyo, registering a sizzling 38.7 degrees
celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the Meteorological
Agency.
	   Historically, the average high temperature for the same day of
the year was 26.6 degrees celsius (80 degrees fahrenheit), the
agency said.
	   The temperature in Tokyo reached hit 34.4 degrees Celsius (94
degrees Fahrenheit).
	   The agency said the heat wave would continue, predicting high
temperatures of 35 degrees Celsius (95 Fahrenheit) Saturday in

 &UR; Unemployment drops in Germany for fourth straight month &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with comments from Kohl, opposition. &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN MADER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl, fighting an
uphill battle for a record fifth term, lauded new figures Friday
that showed German unemployment dropping for the fourth straight
month, to 10.5 percent in June.
	   ``We are making good progress,'' Kohl said at an anniversary
event for a ceramic company in Mettlach, near the French border.
	   But the opposition Social Democrats, who have made Germany's
high jobless rate into the key campaign issue ahead of Sept. 27
elections, said it was premature to speak of a labor market
recovery. They argued that much of the improvement was due to
temporary make-work measures.
	   Kohl, who has been trailing his Social Democratic challenger,
Gerhard Schroeder, in the polls for months, had the good news
released in Bonn four days ahead of schedule.
	   According to government spokesman Otto Hauser, 120,000 fewer
Germans were registered as unemployed in June, compared to the
month before.
	   That put the rate in June at 10.5 percent, compared with 10.9
percent in May and 11.1 percent in June 1997. In all, some 4.075
million Germans were unemployed in June, Hauser said.
	   The jobless rate hit a postwar high of 12.6 percent in January
and February _ nearly topping the psychologically difficult level
of 5 million Germans out of work.
	   But Kohl said now he expected the total number of jobless to
drop below the 4 million mark by the end of the year.
	   Hauser said the figures showed Germany's economic recovery was
gaining ``breadth and dynamic'' and that the government's reform
course is taking hold.
	   Opposition lawmaker Ottmar Schreiner, the SPD's deputy faction
leader in parliament, said the government's make-work measures had
caused temporary labor market improvements. These programs provide
short-term jobs in fields such as street building and park
cleaning.
	   ``Effects of many of these measures will hardly last until
election day,'' Schreiner said in a statement.
	   In eastern Germany, still struggling with the transition to a
market economy, 70,000 fewer people registered as jobless in June
for a rate of 17.2 percent. In western Germany, 50,000 fewer people
registered as jobless, lowering the rate there to 8.9 percent, the
government said.

Yeltsin reiterates support for START-II ratification
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin on Friday again stressed
his support for the START-II arms reduction treaty, which the
Russian parliament has so far refused to ratify.
	   During a meeting with the country's top security officials,
Yeltsin ``emphasized that Russia attributes priority significance
to the START-II treaty,'' said presidential spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky.
	   ``Its ratification will undoubtedly serve both the Russian
national security interests as well as ensuring strategic security
in the world,'' Yastrzhembsky said.
	   The U.S. Senate ratified the START II arms reduction treaty in
1996, but the State Duma has balked, saying it would weaken
Russia's defenses and be too expensive for the cash-strapped
country.
	   START II's opponents say they are against the treaty because it
envisages the destruction of SS-18 ballistic missiles, which carry
10 nuclear warheads each and are considered the most powerful
weapon in Russia's arsenals.
	   Yeltsin agreed with the need for maintaining nuclear arms,
saying they were a key element ensuring Russia's security,
Yastrzhembsky said.
	   ``We will support and develop our potential of nuclear
deterrence,'' Yastrzhembsky quoted Yeltsin as saying.
	   ``But already today, there is a pressing question of natural
aging of the ground, naval and air strategic nuclear forces,'' he
said.
	   START-II supporters among Russian military leaders say that by
the time the treaty's deadline for destroying weapons arrives in
2007, Russia's intercontinental ballistic missiles with multiple
warheads will be at the end of their service life and will have to
be discarded anyway.
	   ``Therefore the tasks of nuclear deterrence must be considered
as a whole, and in perspective,'' Yastrzhembsky said.
	   Yeltsin also denied allegations Friday that Russia's nuclear
arsenal is becoming unreliable, Yastrzhembsky said.
	   ``The country's strategic forces are completely under control,
reliable and fully ensure Russia's national security,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin and security officials also made ``major decisions''
regarding the development of strategic nuclear forces and space
missile forces, their current and future financing, arms reduction
and nonproliferation of mass destruction weapons and missile
technologies, Yastrzhembsky said. He refused to elaborate.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ At least 30 people were died in tribal
fighting between Kenyans and raiders from neighboring Uganda, a
newspaper reported Friday.
	   The independent Daily Nation said the raiders, believed to be of
Karamojong ethnic group from Uganda, attacked more than 200 youths
of the Kenyan Pokot tribe who were taking their animals for grazing
on Thursday morning.
	   The raiders fled across the border into Uganda after a fierce
exchange of fire, the paper said.
	   Hundreds of people have fled their homes on the Kenyan side of
the border fearing further attacks mostly to steal cattle.
	   The latest raid came a month after the Kenyan government
deployed the army to seize guns used in cattle rustling and tribal
feuds between its Pokot and Marakwet tribes.
	   ------
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Declaring war against all who disturb law
and order, Security Minister Gaetan Kakudji announced Friday the
deaths of eight people in a shootout between an army patrol and an
armed religious sect.
	   The deaths occurred early Thursday in Makala, a Kinshasa suburb,
during an operation to seize arms from the sect's leader, Nsemi
Lubdaka, Kakudji said.
	   He said government troops had surrounded Makala and were in
control of the situation.
	   Among the dead were 2 soldiers and 6 civilians, though the fate
of Lubdaka, better known by his nickname ``King of the Congo,'' was
not clear. Details of the shooting incident were not immediately
available.
	   Lubdaka, who claims to have divine powers, has said he has been
ordered by God to restore the ancient African kingdom of Bas Congo.
	   Witnesses said he was preparing to declare himself ruler of
parts of modern Congo and had called for President Laurent Kabila's
resignation.
	   Four years ago, Lubdaka was arrested and jailed by soldiers of
former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko for allegedly declaring the town
of Ndjili, 12 miles (18 kilometers) from the capital, a separate
kingdom.
	   ------
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ A mini-summit by three regional leaders
and the U.N. Secretary-General in the Nigerian capital has ended
with a joint call by the leaders of Nigeria, Sierra Leone and
Liberia for increased cooperation, and for the deployment of U.N.
troops along the Sierra Leone-Liberia border.
	   The Wednesday meeting was convened by U.N. chief Kofi Annan to
discuss security issues and strained relations between Liberia and
Sierra Leone.
	   On Thursday, the leaders signed a statement pledging a
commitment to peace and security and an end to rebel fighting in
Sierra Leone.
	   Relations between President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah of Sierra Leone
and Liberia's Charles Taylor have been strained, with each country
	   accusing the other of backing rebel fighters.
	   The leaders also called for the deployment of United Nations and
West Africa peace keeping troops along the Sierra Leone-Liberia
border.
	   Nigeria has played a strong role as head of the ECOMOG regional
forces credited with brokering an end to Liberia's seven-year civil
war and Kabbah's reinstatement after ousting the military junta
that deposed him.
	   ------
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan
has arrived in his home country for a two-day visit.
	   The Ghananian-born Annan arrived in Accra on Thursday after
three days in the Nigerian capital Abuja. He was accompanied by Sir
Walter Kieran Prendergast, the head of the U.N. political affairs
department.
	   Annan later met with President Jerry Rawlings, who congratulated
him on his recent diplomatic successes, including his talks in
Nigeria to secure the release of political prisoners.
	   On Thursday, Annan announced Nigeria would free all its
political prisoners.
	   ``It is our hope that under your leadership, the world body
would chalk up more successes and we assure you of our support,''
Rawlings said.
	   ------
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Exiled Ethiopian dictator Mengistu Haile
Mariam has been given a new luxury villa by President Robert Mugabe
in case of further assassination attempts, the Zimbabwe Independent
newspaper reported Friday.
	   Three years ago two Eritreans made an abortive attempt to
assassinate Mengistu as he was taking an evening stroll with his
Zimbabwean bodyguards in Harare's exclusive Gun Hill suburb.
	   The two were released in April after winning appeals against
lengthy jail terms.
	   The Independent said police sources revealed Mengistu was moved
to another villa that was easier for his six to nine member
Zimbabwe police protection team to safeguard.
	   Mengistu, wanted in Ethiopia on charges of mass murder and
crimes against humanity during his 17-year rule, fled into exile
after his overthrow in 1991.
	   Mengistu's upkeep, including huge telephone bills he ran up, has
cost Zimbabwe taxpayers millions of dollars, The Independent said.
	   ------
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ The National Elections Commission
blamed suppliers of voting materials for causing chaos during
Tuesday's district elections.
	   Commission chairman Leonardo Simbine claimed that the suppliers,
a French firm he did not name, delivered the materials late,
delaying voting by several hours in Maputo and the nearby city of
Matola.
	   Election observers, however, accused the commission of
inefficiency and mismanagement of polling.
	   Seals to secure ballot boxes were the wrong size and many
polling stations were not supplied with scissors necessary to trim
them.
	   Some materials were locked away, keys went missing and some
ballot boxes had to be broken open, monitors said.
	   In Maputo and Matola, accounting for 30 percent of voters, not a
single polling station opened on time.
	   The main opposition party RENAMO on Thursday called on President
Joaquim Chissano to annul the polling.
	   RENAMO boycotted the elections, claiming there were
irregularities in voters' lists.
	   Preliminary results put Chissano's ruling party in the lead in
most of the 33 polling districts.
	   ------
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Namibia has been selected by the World
Health Organization to participate in a major international survey
on domestic violence, The Namibian newspaper reported Friday.
	   It said Namibian health authorities estimated nearly 50 percent
of women and children admitted to emergency wards were hurt in
domestic violence.
	   This may have been linked to the southwest African nation's
``historical culture of violence'' under apartheid rule before
independence, medical anthropologist Debie Lebeau, a researcher at
the University of Namibia's Department of Sociology, told the
paper.
	   Domestic violence was also prevalent in South Africa.
	   ``Since violence was used as an official control mechanism over
a long period of time in both countries during the apartheid years,
researchers are interested in the possible link between that type
of violence and violence as a conflict resolution mechanism in the
home,'' Lebeau said.
	   The WHO study, which will include two African countries, two
Latin American and two Asian countries and one European country,
will run over two years.

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ In a repeat of the 1978 final, the
Netherlands faces Argentina on Saturday, this time with a place in
the World Cup's last four at stake.
	   On home soil, Argentina won the '78 game 3-1 after extra time
for its first Cup championship, went on to win another title in
1986 and made the finals again in 1990. The Dutch haven't even made
the semifinals since.
	   But Dutch captain Frank de Boer says 20 years is too long to
harbor thoughts of revenge as the teams prepare for their first
World Cup meeting since the Buenos Aires encounter.
	   ``For me, it is not important,'' De Boer said. ``This generation
just wants to reach their goal, and that is to go as far as
possible.''
	   Both sides are unbeaten going into the quarterfinals. But both
had to survive hard-fought second round matches to get this far.
	   The Dutch progressed after beating Yugoslavia 2-1 on a
92nd-minute goal by midfielder Edgar Davids; Argentina came from
behind to force a 2-2 draw with England and then won the match 4-3
on penalties.
	   Argentine coach Daniel Passarella seems to be anticipating a
similarly close encounter against the Netherlands. In training
Thursday, goalkeeper Carlos Roa was put through his paces against a
barrage of spot kicks.
	   ``The Netherlands is a great team, with players with tremendous
technical skills,'' said Argentina midfielder and team captain
Diego Simeone. ``We will try to take the midfield from them, it's
there because where they are especially strong.''
	   Passarella also is likely to make at least one change to his
defense, which cruised through the qualification round without
conceding a goal but at times was static and vulnerable against
England.
	   Fullback Roberto Sensini, who missed Argentina's last two
matches with a pulled muscle, is expected to play, relegating
Nelson Vivas to the bench.
	   While five-goal marksman Gabriel Batistuta is expected to remain
a starter against the Dutch, Passarella's training sessions suggest
Abel Balbo, a striker with Italy's Roma, will start instead of
Valencia's Claudio Lopez.
	   The fact that Passarella is thinking about changes, suggests
that the team isn't performing as well as he would like.
	   Batistuta, who was replaced by Hernan Crespo midway through the
second half against England, was asked whether the Argentine team
has some weak spots.
	   ``The team must have some,'' he said. ``Otherwise we would be
unbeatable.''
	   The Netherlands likely will be missing right back Michael
Reiziger, who suffered a badly bruised foot against Yugoslavia. If
he is not fit, coach Guus Hiddink will likely start with versatile
midfielder Aron Winter in Reiziger's place.
	   ``The team is mentally fit and physically fit so we are feeling
confident going into the tough task in Marseille,'' Hiddink said.
	   ``It is good to be in the last eight. That is excellent, but we
are not satisfied with that. We will play them in our own style to
make the step to the last four.''
	   Hiddink's talent-packed young team also has to overcome a
psychological barrier Saturday. The Netherlands has exited its last
two big tournaments at the quarterfinal stage _ at the 1994 World
Cup and the 1996 European Championship.
	   But Hiddink said those defeats would not be on his players'
minds.
	   ``The only hurdle is a strong Argentinean side, so we have to
jump high.''
	   Passarella, who captained Argentina when it beat the Netherlands
in the 1978 final, appears to be intent on beefing up his team's
defensive capabilities as it faces the attacking Dutch lineup.
	   Javier Zanetti, whom Passarella considers too eager to attack
and to unenthusiastic to defend, looks likely to give up his
starting place to Mauricio Pineda.
	   But even if the Argentines reign in their usual offensive style
against the Dutch, Hiddink has drummed into his team that it must
concentrate throughout the game to avoid Batistuta's threat.
	   ``I know Batistuta very well from my two years in Italy,'' Dutch
striker Dennis Bergkamp said of the Fiorentina star. ``If he gets
good service from his team, he never makes a mistake.''
	   For Dutch midfielder Boudewijn Zenden, the match at the Stade
Velodrome in almost as big as the final.
	   ``If we win this game, we will be well on the way to being world
champions,'' he said. ``We will get extra confidence because I
think Brazil is as good as Argentina, but not better.''

Report: At least 100 killed in fighting over Guinea-Bissau town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ At least 100 civilians, most of them
women and children, were killed in a battle for control of a
strategic town in Guinea-Bissau between government forces and a
rebel army faction, according to a report Friday.
	   Senegalese troops supporting President Joao Bernardo Vieira
stormed rebel-held Mansoa, 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of the
capital Bissau, on Thursday, according to reports from the Italian
missionary news agency Misna, which has members there.
	   The Senegalese soldiers burned villages around Mansoa and
committed ``acts of incredible cruelty, slaying innocent people,''
an unidentified local woman was quoted as saying by Misna.
	   Portugal's Defense Ministry said it knew a battle had taken
place in Mansoa but could not confirm the details provided by
Misna.
	   A spokesman said intelligence reports indicated a shift in the
focus of fighting towards the interior.
	   ``In general terms, the fighting has moved to previously quiet
inland areas, away from the capital,'' he said on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The spread of the fighting to the interior indicated the
26-day-old conflict is developing into a full-blown civil war in
this impoverished former Portuguese colony on the west African
coast.
	   Mansoa lies at the intersection of two major roads leading to
the capital from the east and the north.
	   Meanwhile, the rebel faction and Senegalese forces shelled each
other's positions in the capital Bissau on Friday, according to
Portuguese radio RDP-Africa.
	   The rebels, led by former army chief Brig. Ansumane Mane, have
been entrenched in positions around Bissau's airport and a nearby
military garrison since they mutinied June 7. They have demanded
that Vieira, whom they accuse of corruption, stand down.
	   Guinea-Bissau, which gained independence in 1975, has a
population of some 1 million people with most dependent on peanut
farming.
	   The rebels claim that almost all the country's 6,000-strong army
has joined their rebellion. Senegal has provided some 1,300 troops
to support Vieira.
	   Thousands fled Mansoa on Wednesday when the rebels warned local
people that Senegalese forces were preparing a large-scale assault.
	   Rebels and Senegalese troops engaged in hand-to-hand combat in
the outskirts of Mansoa, local missionaries told Misna, but there
was no information on whether the loyalist forces had wrested the
town from the rebels.
	   Portuguese radio TSF also reported that crowds of people fled
Nhacra, 30km outside Bissau, on Friday as the fighting moved
closer, adding to the thousands of people displaced by the
conflict.
	   On Friday, Portuguese ambassador Fernando Henriques da Silva met
with government officials as part of his ongoing mediation effort.
He met a rebel delegation on Wednesday.
	   ``We are conveying information between the two sides,''
Henriques da Silva said on RDP-Africa, but declined to say whether
progress was being made.
	   The conflict erupted after Vieira accused Mane of selling arms
to Casamance separatists fighting the Senegalese government. Mane
said it was Vieira who was trafficking arms to the region.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Scorching North African winds swept over
Greece and Italy on Friday, pushing temperatures as high as 45 C
(113 F) and killing at least 10 people.
	   Temperatures were not expected to drop until the end of the
weekend and hospitals in both countries were on full alert.
	   A combination of high temperatures and little wind pushed air
pollution levels into danger levels in the mountain-ringed Athens
basin, sending hundreds of people to hospitals suffering from heat
stroke and exhaustion. Officials said air pollution levels had hit
their highest point in two years.
	   Temperatures in Athens climbed as high as 44 C (111 F) and 45 C
(113 F) in the southern city of Argos. On Thursday, the thermometer
soared to to 48 C (118 F) in Catania, Italy. Rome sweltered under
37 C (99 F) most of the week. Normal seasonal temperatures hover
around 33 C (91 F).

	   ROME (AP) _ Hospitals went on full alert to cope with
heat-related illnesses Friday after soaring temperatures were
blamed for at least six deaths in Italy.
	   The highest temperatures were reported in Sicily, with the
thermometer reaching 48 degrees Celsius (118 F) Thursday in
Catania.
	   But most of Italy baked in the heat. In Rome temperatures
reached 37 degrees Celsius (99 F) during the week, and no relief
was expected before Sunday.
	   The deaths blamed on the heat included an 18-month-old boy left
inside a camper in the sun in Rome, news reports said.
	   Fires broke out throughout Sicily and southern regions of
Calabria and Puglia.
	   Two firefighters suffered burns in Palermo, where some apartment
buildings near fires had to be evacuated.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A special session of Indonesia's
consultative assembly will convene Nov. 10 to pass political
reforms and prepare for the election of a new Parliament, the
government announced Friday.
	   Last month, Indonesia's new President B.J. Habibie and
Parliament leaders agreed to hold the session of the 1,000-seat
People's Consultative Assembly at the end of this year or early
next year.
	   The assembly _ made up of 500 lawmakers and 500 government
appointees _ will be joined by the new lawmakers to choose a new
president and vice president in late 1999.
	   The special assembly is part of the reform agenda put in place
by Habibie after the resignation of President Suharto, whose
32-year reign was ended in May by a string of mass riots and
protests against his rule.

Chechen prime minister offers resignation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechnya's acting prime minister has submitted his
resignation, saying his six-month term has come to an end, news
agencies said Friday.
	   But a government spokesman said it was unlikely that the
president would accept the resignation of Shamil Basayev, a former
guerrilla commander who has headed the rebel republic's government
since January.
	   President Aslan Maskhadov also holds the title of prime minister
of Chechnya, but asked Basayev _ a popular leader with a large
following _ to form a government and named him acting prime
minister.
	   ``My resignation today is explained by ethics,'' Basayev said
Friday, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``When I was
appointed to the post, I said that I will quit in six months.''
	   In a speech, Basayev excluded the possibility that he would
remain in the post, ``even if the president asks and refuses to
accept my resignation,'' according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Maskhadov and Basayev have had difficulty imposing order on the
rebel republic, where hundreds of people have been kidnapped and
held for ransom since a two-year war for independence ended in
1996.
	   Two of the most prominent captives, Britons Camilla Carr and Jon
James, were to mark the one-year anniversary of their capture on
Saturday.
	   Carr, 40, and James, 37, were abducted July 4, 1997, from their
home in the Chechen capital of Grozny. The husband and wife team
had been working for the Center for Peacemaking and Community
Development, a charity with Quaker links that runs a home for needy
children.
	   There was no word Friday on their location or condition.
	   Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin said another
prominent captive, presidential envoy Valentin Vlasov, is ``alive
and doing well,'' according to Interfax. The report did not provide
more detail.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent and has largely run its
own affairs since Russian troops pulled out in the fall of 1996.
The Kremlin insists the Muslim republic remains a part of Russia,
and no country has recognized Chechnya as independent.

One of China's oldest captive pandas dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Shasha, China's oldest female panda in captivity,
has died from heart failure at age 33, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported Friday.
	   Shasha died at the zoo in central Taiyuan on Thursday, four days
after her heart failed and breathing stopped, Xinhua said.
	   Veterinarians began administering round-the-clock intensive care
but decided to discontinue the measures due to Shasha's advanced
age and condition, the news agency said.
	   The average life span of the highly endangered panda is about 20
years. Xinhua said in recent years Shasha suffered from epilepsy
and cataracts.
	   She was the third elderly panda to die in Chinese zoos this
year.

Deadly heat wave strikes Greece, Italy

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Scorching North African winds swept over
Greece and Italy on Friday, pushing temperatures as high as 45
degrees Celsius (113 degrees F) and killing at least 10 people.
	   Temperatures were not expected to drop until the end of the
weekend and hospitals in both countries were placed on full alert
to deal with the blistering heat wave. Normal seasonal temperatures
hover around 33 degrees Celsius (91 F) in the region.
	   ``Hot air masses in the lower atmosphere from North Africa are
at their maximum transfer rate,'' said meteorologist Nikos
Kanderes. ``The first strong heat wave of the year will be history
on Sunday.''
	   A combination of high temperatures and little wind pushed air
pollution levels beyond danger levels in the mountain-ringed Athens
basin, sending hundreds of people to hospitals suffering from heat
stroke and exhaustion. Officials said air pollution levels had hit
their highest point in two years.
	   Temperatures in Athens climbed as high as 44 degrees Celsius
(111 F) and 45 degrees Celsius (113 F) in the southern city of
Argos. On Thursday, the thermometer soared to to 48 degrees Celsius
(118 F) in Catania, Italy. Rome has sweltered under 37 degree
weather (99 F) most of the week.
	   The Mediterranean island of Malta, located in the path of the
Saharan winds, also broiled under 43-degree Celsius (110-F)
temperatures.
	   At least four deaths in Greece were blamed on the weather,
including a 3-year-old boy who died of heat stroke in the
southwestern port of Patras and an illegal Albanian immigrant who
collapsed crossing the border.
	   In Italy, at least six deaths were attributed to the heat, news
reports said. They included an 18-month-old boy left inside a
camper in the sun in Rome.
	   Fires broke out throughout Sicily and southern regions of
Calabria and Puglia, while blazes broke out in several parts of
Greece.
	   Two firefighters suffered burns in Palermo, Italy, where some
apartment buildings near fires had to be evacuated.
	   In Athens, health officials appealed for people to restrict
their movements and stay out of the sun. State and municipal
authorities also set up special air-conditioned rooms for elderly
people and those with respiratory problems to cope with the heat.
	   Greece's public power company also warned of sporadic
electricity shortages around this capital of nearly 5 million
people because of increased use of air conditioners.
	   Electricity consumption broke all records Thursday and Friday in
Greece. High consumption blacked out nearly half the capital
earlier this week.
	   Some astrophysicists in Greece blamed the increased heat on an
11-year sun cycle that increases the amount of solar radiation
reaching the earth.
	   ``We've also found that the hole in the ozone layer and the
temperature of the earth correspondingly change every 11 years,''
Xenophon Mousas, head of the Astrophysics Lab at Athens University,
told the daily Exousia.

EU to take Ireland, Greece, France to court over free trade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union said Friday it will
take Ireland, France and Greece to the European Court of Justice
for violating EU rules on free trade in the 15-nation bloc.
	   In a statement, the EU executive Commission said it will sue
Ireland over its rules on hallmarking for objects made of precious
metals. These rules discriminate against imports and are an
``unjustified trade barrier.''
	   The Commission will sue France over its rules on labeling of
spirits. In France, beverages of an alcoholic strength higher than
25 percent in volume must carry a label proving that a contribution
to French social security has been paid.
	   This requirement creates extra costs for exporters who must
label their beverages just for the French market, the Commission
said.
	   Greece will be sued over price controls on pharmaceuticals.
``Legislation imposes prices for pharmaceuticals which are so low
as to render imports from other (EU countries) commercially
unviable,'' the Commission said.
	   Separately, the Commission warned France and Greece, as well as
several other EU countries - Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands,
Sweden and Austria - over specific areas in which these countries
violate free trade rules.
	   The countries have two months to comply with EU rules in the
targeted sectors, which range from chocolate and margarine to car
spare parts and telecommunications receivers.

Czech presidential couple awarded damages for offensive ad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A court awarded President Vaclav
Havel and his wife damages in a settlement Friday with an
advertising company that used Havel's likeness in an offensive
context for a billboard campaign.
	   The Brno-based M.A.R.S. advertising company is to pay the Havels
five million koruna (dlrs 157,000) within 15 days. The money will
be donated to a fund for victims of floods that hit the eastern
Czech Republic last year, Havel said in a statement carried by the
CTK news agency.
	   The advertisement for the Raveli shoe company, called ``Vaclavka
and Dasenka'' _ a word play on the presidential couple's first
names suggesting Havel is a mushroom and his wife a dog _ depicts a
plaster bust in the likeness of Havel, being licked by a small
terrier.

EU reaches agreement on fuel emissions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union officials have
introduced stricter controls on vehicle fuel emissions in an effort
to clear the air.
	   ``The auto-oil measures ... will make a positive difference to
the lives of everyone in Europe,'' EU Environment Commissioner Ritt
Bjerregaard said in a statement this week. ``We shall have cleaner
air in our cities.''
	   Environment officials from EU governments and members of the
European Parliament reached an accord Monday to cut levels of
noxious chemicals including sulfur, lead and carbon monoxide from
gasoline and diesel.
	   Under the agreement, leaded fuels will be phased out by 2000 and
very low sulfur fuels will become mandatory from 2005. EU nations
will, however, be able to seek exemptions.
	   In a statement, the EU's executive Commission said the package
will reduce emissions per vehicle by around 70 percent.
	   The agreement still requires ratification from the 626-member
parliament and member nations.
	   On Thursday, meanwhile, the EU's executive Commission said it
would take France to court for failing to improve the quality of
drinking water in the western region of Brittany.
	   In a statement, the Commission said that in several parts of
Brittany, river water used for drinking purposes consistently
registered nitrate levels that exceeded EU water quality rules.

Families of Dodi, Diana have been kind, say parents of chauffeur
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The parents of the drunk chauffeur who died with
Princess Diana in a Paris car wreck say they have received nothing
but kindness from the princess's family and relatives of her
boyfriend Dodi Fayed, who was also killed.
	   In an interview published in the British tabloid Express on
Friday _ what would have been driver Henri Paul's 42nd birthday _
Jean and Gisele Paul said they were greeted cordially by Diana's
mother when they attended a recent six-hour legal summit in Paris
before the judge investigating the Aug. 31 crash.
	   ``We had a very warm meeting with Diana's mother, Mrs. Shand
Kydd. She spoke to us in slow but perfect French and understood our
grief,'' Mrs. Paul was quoted as saying. ``She was speaking to us
as one grieving parent to another. She understood our pain.''
	   She said Mohamed Al Fayed, Dodi's millionaire father, ``came up
to us and greeted us warmly. He shook our hands.''
	   ``We were fearful that he might blame our son for what happened,
but there was no bad feeling from him,'' she was quoted as saying.
	   The Express said it was the first time the Pauls, who live in
the port city of Lorient, in southern Brittany, have spoken
in-depth about the crash.
	   The newspaper said the couple never received any form of
condolence from the royal family, although the British Embassy in
Paris sent a letter of sympathy.
	   The couple denied their son was an alcoholic and that his
drinking caused the crash. French police said the chauffeur's
blood-alcohol content was way over the legal limit the night of
Aug. 31.
	   ``We may never know what really happened on the night of the
accident, but I cannot accept he was to blame,'' Jean Paul was
quoted as saying.
	   Mrs. Paul told the newspaper that the pain goes on.
	   ``What I do know is that we have been to hell. My husband and I
are dead inside,'' she said. ``There have been so many awful things
said about our son and it is hard to deal with them. Even now I
cannot bring myself to look at photographs of my Henri.''

Second bodyguard interviewed by judge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A second bodyguard working for the Al Fayed family
the night of the crash that killed Princess Diana was interviewed
by a French judge Friday.
	   Kes Wingfield, who has since quit the service of Mohamed Al
Fayed, met with Judge Marie-Christine Devidal at his own request.
Devidal is one of two judges heading up the investigation into
Diana's death Aug. 31 in a Paris car crash.
	   Wingfield met with the judge behind closed doors at the Palais
de Justice in central Paris. He was expected to discuss his
criticisms of the security measures in place the night of the
crash.
	   The crash also killed Diana's boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and Henri
Paul, their driver. Paul was heavily drunk at the time.
	   The sole survivor, fellow bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, also has
quit working for Al Fayed. He's been interviewed several times by
the judges but is expected to be interviewed again soon.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Following several news reports suggesting British
Airways was about to order new jets for the first time from Airbus
Industrie, the airline said Friday it still was in negotiations.
	   British Airways hopes to announce later this summer whether its
next order for short-haul jets will go to Airbus, the European
plane-making consortium, or to the Boeing Co., the big U.S.
aircraft manufacturer from Seattle.
	   British Airways has always been a loyal Boeing customer,
although it has 10 Airbus jets in its fleet that were acquired when
British Airways took over a smaller airline that had some.
	   Any purchase of new Airbus jets by British Airways would mark a
huge victory for the Europeans in the always-intense rivalry.
	   Several newspapers had suggested British Airways would make a
statement after its board held a regular monthly meeting Friday,
but the carrier said after it was over that no decision has been
made.

Japan brings auto dispute with Canada to WTO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan on Friday filed a complaint with the World
Trade Organization accusing Canada of a discriminatory automotive
policy, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   Tokyo argues that Canada's provision of limiting its waiver of
duties on automotive imports to some manufacturers, including
subsidiaries of the ``Big Three'' U.S. automakers, violates WTO
rules, the report said.
	   Officials could not be reached for comment late Friday.
	   Japan asked Canada on Friday to open bilateral talks on the
issue as an initial step for dispute resolution, officials were
quoted as saying. Tokyo hopes to begin bilateral consultations by
the end of this month.
	   Japan plans to bring the matter to the WTO dispute settlement
panel if the issue is not resolved bilaterally.
	   Ottawa exempts five foreign automakers that have Canadian
subsidiaries from its 6.7 percent import duty on assembled cars
under certain conditions, the report said.
	   The five are General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp., all of the United States, AB Volvo of Sweden and CAMI
Automotive Inc., a joint venture between General Motors and Japan's
Suzuki Motor Corp.
	   Japan moved to file the complaint since Canada last month
decided to maintain the tariff despite criticism by other overseas
automakers, the Japanese officials said.
	   Japan has long lobbied for scrapping the tariff, saying it
violates most-favored-nation treatment under WTO rules.
	   Canada imported 160,000 autos in 1997, of which 110,000 were
from Japan and 11,000 were imported tax-free, including those from
the U.S. Big Three, the report said.

EU takes Belgium to court over free movement of capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission said Friday it will take Belgium to the European Court
of Justice for violating EU rules on the free movement of capital.
	   Under Belgian law, Belgian residents cannot subscribe to a 1
billion mark loan (dlrs 1.8 billion) loan that the Belgian finance
ministry took out with Dresdner Bank AG and Schweizerischer
Bankverein AG, both in Frankfurt.
	   Only banks, financial intermediaries and institutional investors
can subscribe to the loan.
	   The Commission rejected Belgian claims that residents were
excluded on tax grounds, because of the difficulties linked to
carrying out tax checks.
	   ``It is up to the Belgian authorities to find ways of improving
such checks and to enforce the requirement - already contained in
Belgian law - that the beneficiaries of such revenue must declare
it,'' the Commission said.
	   ``The alleged difficulties do not .. justify measures liable to
hinder the free movement of capital,'' it concluded.
	   The European Court of Justice is based in Luxembourg.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The Polish parliament reacted harshly
Friday to a German resolution condemning the postwar expulsion of
Germans from land given by the Allies to Poland after World War II.
	   In a unanimous vote with only two abstentions, the Sejm
criticized a resolution passed by the German parliament, or
Bundestag, on May 29, saying ``it does not serve the growing
cooperation between Poland and Germany.''
	   The Bundestag appealed to east European candidates to the
European Union to the admit right of German exiles to settle in the
areas they inhabited before World War II, an issue that remains
sensitive both in Germany and its eastern neighbors, Poland and the
Czech Republic.
	   In response, the Sejm declared: ``Our membership in the European
Union must mean the inviolability of the Polish borders ... and
Polish ownership rights to property.''
	   The Association of Exiles in Germany issued a statement in Bonn
condemning the Polish declaration, calling it ``a de facto decision
to shut the German exiles, resettlers and the remaining minority
and their families out of the reconciliation process.''
	   Erika Steinbach, the president of the group, said it could not
be accepted that the parliament in Warsaw ``now suddenly declares
the open ownership question as untouchable. ...
	   ``Poland's path into Europe can not go this way,'' Steinbach
said.
	   Following the Potsdam Allied Conference in August 1945, Poland
ceded a large part of its eastern territories to the former Soviet
Union, but it gained lands in the west that previously belonged to
Germany. The move forced resettlement of about 5 million Germans
from Poland.
	   The conference also sanctioned the expulsion of some 2.5 million
Germans from a border region in then-Czechoslovakia.
	   Recent letters from German citizens demanding return of their
real estate nationalized by Poland's communist authorities in 1945
highlighted Polish fears that Poland's entry into the EU will
enable German exiles to reclaim their former property.
	   Polish observers, however, said it was more likely that
Germany's center-right coalition passed the resolution, which did
not really say anything new, to solidify support among the
politically powerful exile groups ahead of Germany's Sept. 27
national elections.

Belarus celebrates national holiday with Soviet-style fanfare

	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarus celebrated its national holiday
Friday with Soviet-style fanfare, when a parade of tanks, troops
and crowds carrying pictures of Stalin streamed by President
Alexander Lukashenko, who stood high on a podium in the capital's
main square.
	   Before the parade of missile launchers, anti-aircraft systems,
and 4,200 servicemen, Lukashenko spoke out against western
countries that have criticized him for stifling political
opposition and suppressing the media.
	   ``The attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign
states, the building of a new world order _ these are hallmarks of
the present time,'' he said.
	   ``A half-century ago someone else attempted to establish a new
order and it resulted in the tragedy of World War II, and the death
of millions.''
	   Lukashenko, who openly years for the restoration of the Soviet
Union, has restored many Soviet-era practices since his 1994
election.
	   In 1996 he changed Belarus' national holiday from June 27, the
anniversary of its declaration of independence, to July 3, the
anniversary of its liberation from the Nazi occupation.
	   Belarus became independent in 1991 as part of the breakup of the
Soviet Union.
	   In the parade, the troops were followed by the Belarusian
Patriotic Union of Youth, whose members carried signs that read
``The new generation chooses duty, honor, and common sense'' and
``Young people with the young president.''
	   A procession of Belarusian athletes followed, as well as rows of
Belarusian trucks and tractors.
	   Four protesters later marched in Minsk's main square and down
its central street to protest Lukashenko's alleged human rights
abuses.
	   ``We want to remember our fellow citizens who are celebrating
this holiday while three political prisoners sit behind bars in
Belarusian prisons,'' said Oleg Bebenin, who held a sign reading
``Free the political prisoners!''
	   A policeman tried to take the signs, but the protesters refused.
No arrests were made.

22 killed, 100 injured in ongoing dispute over chain saw in Yemen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Twenty-two people have been killed and 100
wounded in tribal clashes over ownership of a chain saw, a tribal
leader said Friday.
	   The victims, including seven women, died in a series of
incidents since the dispute started in February, said the tribal
leader, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   He said at least 50 children have been orphaned and are now
living with relatives.
	   The battles between members of Al-Imaisi and Al-Firassi tribes,
both from the northern Dhamar province, have centered on which
tribe owns the chain saw.
	   Al-Firassi tribesmen are partners with the Al-Imaisi in building
homes and claim that they have partnership rights to the saw. The
Al-Imaisi disagree.
	   The tribes have attacked each other's homes and property and
have killed livestock, the sources said.
	   In the fighting, the rival tribes have attacked each other's
homes and property and have killed livestock. Many of the villagers
have moved to nearby villages to avoid the violence.
	   A weekly opposition paper criticized the government for not
doing anything to stop the bloodshed. The weekly Al-Sahwa
newspaper, run by the opposition Islah party, said in an editorial
Friday that the dispute would claim many more lives and spread to
the entire province if the government did not act immediately.
	   Fighting among rival clans, mostly over land claims, is common
in Yemen, an impoverished country of about 17 million people in the
southern part of the Arabian Peninsula.

World Cup: Italy, France tied 0-0 at halftime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ France kept constant pressure on the
Italian goal in a rough-and-tumble 0-0 first half Friday in the
quarterfinals of the World Cup.
	   The best scoring chance came two minutes into injury time when
France's Didier Deschamps fed Youri Djorkaeff in the penalty area.
Djorkaeff, with no one but goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca in front of
him, mis-kicked and pulled the shot wide left.
	   What the game lacked in scoring, it made up for in acrobatic
tackles and dives and their accompanying bumps and bruises. The
worst came in the 33rd minute, when Laurent Blanc landed with both
feet flush on the body of teammate Emmanuel Petit after both tried
to block a shot from Italy's Christian Vieri.
	   Petit lay in agony before he was taken off on a stretcher,
although he returned to the game less than five minutes later.
	   France went on the attack from the opening whistle. Zinedine
Zidane shot across the goalmouth and Petit had a bicycle kick
attempt stopped by Pagliuca, both in the fifth minute.
	   Italy rarely penetrated the French half of the field in the
first 30 minutes. Its best scoring chance came on a counterattack
in the ninth, when Vieri had to jump over defender Lilian Thuram to
get his head on Francesco Moriero's cross at the far post. The
Italian striker put the ball just wide left.
	   Both coaches fielded defensive lineups. France's Aime Jacquet
started midfielder Christian Karembeu in place of striker Thierry
Henry, who has scored three goals in the tournament but is
suffering from an ankle sprain. Italy coach Cesare Maldini included
tough defender Gianluca Pessotto instead of the more
offensive-minded Demetrio Albertini.
	   The winner plays either Germany or Croatia on Wednesday at
Saint-Denis.

South Africa 393 for two at tea on the second day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tea score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Gary Kirsten was in line for a maiden
test double century as South Africa's run-feast continued in the
third cricket test against England on Friday.
	   The veteran opener anchored the South African innings on day two
with an unbeaten 183 as the visitors went to tea at 393 for two at
Old Trafford.
	   Kirsten's career-best innings has lasted 10 hours and is easily
the longest for South African in test cricket.
	   The late Jackie McGlew's 575 minutes innings against Australia
at Durban in 1957/58, when he scored 105, was the previous record.
	   Kirsten, with the help of Jacques Kallis (132) and Daryll
Cullinan, 51 not out, ground out the hapless England bowlers on an
easy-paced pitch, giving South Africa the upper hand to extend the
1-0 lead.
	   After losing opener Gehardus Liebenberg (16) in the ninth over
of the innings, South Africa didn't lose another for nearly 24
hours, when Kallis was finally dismissed on the second morning.
	   Kallis and Kirsten shared a record 238 runs for the second
wicket before Darren Gough claimed England's second wicket of the
innings.
	   An unplayable ball accounted for Kallis. The No.3 managed to add
just 16 to his overnight total when Gough knocked his off stump
back. Kallis hit 16 boundaries off 266 balls.
	   South Africa, resuming the day on 237 for one, made slow
progress in the pre-lunch session, adding just 63 runs in 29 overs.
	   Kirsten, having taken eight just over six hours for his seventh
test century, was more enterprising in reaching his 150 and hit 10
boundaries in his third fifty.
	   Kirsten, a 43-test veteran, bettered his previous highest _ 133
against India at Calcutta in 1996/97 _ the same match he shared
South Africa's previous second wicket record _ 212 with Cullinan.
	   Cullinan preferred to play second fiddle to the vice captain,
who took the attack to the England spinners in the post lunch
session.
	   Kirsten has so far hit 23 boundaries and a six, off medium
paceman Dominic Cork, in the 479 balls he has faced.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Olympic and world 100-meter champion
Linford Christie won a libel suit Friday against a writer who
alleged the sprinter used performance-enhancing drugs.
	   The former sprint champion was awarded 40,000 pounds (dlrs
66,400) in damages. The judge also ruled Christie's legal costs _
estimated at 200,000 pounds (dlrs 332,000) _ be paid by writer John
McVicar.
	   A jury of six men and six women returned a verdict against
McVicar, a convicted armed robber turned author, following a 14-day
High Court hearing in London.
	   The jury took less than five hours to decide that McVicar's
article, ``How did Linford get this good?'', published in the
September 1995 issue of Spiked magazine, was libelous.
	   The 1992 Olympic gold medalist and 1995 world 100-meter champion
was also suing the printers and distributors of the now defunct
magazine. The will pay the 40,000 (dlrs 66,400) damage award with
McVicar paying Christie's legal costs.

Cyprus shares up on incentive package
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Taking head from a package of incentive
passed by parliament, share prices recorded Friday their biggest
one-day increase in six weeks, traders said.
	   The official Cyprus Stock Exchange all-share index closed up
1.39 percent but ended a modest 0.81 percent up week-on-week.
Friday's rise was the biggest in a single day since May 29, when
the index rose by 1.54 percent.
	   The market incentives, approved by parliament Thursday night,
allow offshore companies on the island to list and invest in the
fledgling bourse without losing their tax breaks. There are more
than 30,000 offshore companies in Cyprus, of which about a 1,000
maintain full-fledged offices.
	   The bill also provided for a five-year tax break of 50 percent
to newly listed companies, with 100,000 Cyprus pounds (dlrs
187,000) in profit as the maximum allowance. Investors are also
given tax breaks if they invest in newly listed companies.
	   ``The market felt good about the incentives,'' said Neophytos
Neophytou of AAA United Stockbrokers.
	   ``The mood was bubbly,'' said Yiannos Andronikou of Suphire, a
Nicosia-based brokerage. ``But the rise could also be attributed to
the feeling by many traders that prices had fallen so much it was
time to buy cheap.''
	   Shares on the Cyprus bourse, which trades in about 50
securities, made gains of about 20 percent in the first four months
of the year, but have shed about half of these gains since the
start of May when efforts to restart talks on a Cyprus settlement
hit a new deadlock.

Court asks a powerful politician to surrender
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PATNA, India (AP) _ A powerful Indian politician will challenge
a court order asking him to surrender to face charges of stealing
government funds, his attorney said Friday.
	   Laloo Prasad Yadav, the former top elected official of the
eastern Indian state of Bihar, is accused of siphoning off millions
of rupees (dollars) meant for government agricultural programs.
	   He was jailed for four months before being released on bail in
December. He is awaiting trial in the case.
	   On Thursday, Special Judge S.K. Lal asked him to surrender
before July 27 to answer some fresh charges filed by the Central
Bureau of Investigation, India's FBI.
	   `The court can't ask Yadav to surrender since he already has
been released on bail,'' Chittaranjan Prasad Sinha, Yadav's
attorney, said in Patna, the capital of Bihar state. ``We will
challenge the court order in the next few days.''
	   Yadav stepped down as the Bihar state chief minister after he
was charged, but had his wife replace him in the office.
	   If convicted, Yadav can be jailed up to seven years.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's plans to dispose of more than 100 nuclear
submarines of its northern fleet by 2000 are unrealistic, a news
agency reported Friday.
	   The factory that will dismantle the submarines can only handle
two to three reactors a year, and two-thirds of the submarines have
two reactors, the ITAR-Tass news agency said, citing an official
from the Association of Economic Cooperation in Russia's Northwest.
	   More than 145 other nuclear reactors are also in line to be
dismantled, and they are stored in containers built in the 1960's
that are badly decaying, the association said, according to
ITAR-Tass.
	   Western countries have expressed growing concern about Russia's
nuclear waste disposal problems. Norway, the only NATO member to
share a border with Russia, has signed agreements to build a new
nuclear waste disposal plant and to help pay for the clean-up.
	   However, it's dlrs 35 million contribution is only a fraction of
the several billion dollars needed to finish the job.

Court lowers sentences for communist agents convicted of torture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ An appeals court lowered prison sentences
Friday for four communist security agents convicted of torturing
pro-democracy activists.
	   The court in Warsaw said the sentences ordered by a lower court
were longer than what is recommended under Poland's penal code.
	   The sentence for the main convict, a former top official at the
communist-era Ministry of Public Security, was lowered from nine to
7 1-2 years. The man, 81-year-old Col. Adam Humer, was convicted of
beating and intimidating dissidents during interrogations.
	   The so-called ``Humer trial'' in 1996 has been the only
prosecution of communist-era security officers for brutal treatment
of prisoners.

EU takes France, Germany, Austria to court over public contracts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission said Friday it will take France, Germany and Austria to
court for violating EU rules which require that public contracts be
put up for competitive tender.
	   France violated EU procurement laws on water, energy, transport
and telecommunications when it awarded the main supply contract for
an automatic light rail transit system in the city of Rennes, the
Commission said.
	   ``The explanations given by the French authorities concerning
the conditions under which the contract was awarded ... were not
satisfactory,'' it said.
	   In Germany, the case concerns DBP Postdienst, which in 1993 put
out to tender a contract for the supply of mail sorting equipment.
	   In 1996, the German government told the Commission that the DBP
Postdienst had been privatized and that legal proceedings were
under way to determine whether the new company, PostAG, had to
apply the public procurement rules.
	   ``Since no hearing has been announced as part of those
proceedings, the Commission has decided to bring the matter before
the Court of Justice,'' the Commission statement said.
	   The EU executive body will take Austria to Court for failing to
transpose all EU rules on public procurement into national law.

German trial of five in refugee home arson attack ends
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with convictions, sentenced to probation, other
details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT AN DER ODER, Germany (AP) _ A state court convicted
four men of complicity in a 1992 arson attack on a refugee home in
eastern Germany Friday and gave them suspended sentences of up to
30 months.
	   The trial, which opened June 12, came to an abrupt end when the
only two defendants who had denied a role in the plot changed their
stance and confessed. That allowed the Brandenburg state court in
Frankfurt an der Oder to stop taking testimony and wrap up the
trial.
	   Marco Schmidt, 25, who admitted he had helped put together a
Molotov cocktail for the arson, was given a 30-month suspended
sentence and fined 1,000 marks (dlrs 550).
	   His stepfather, Hans-Juergen Schmidt, 49, who said he knew what
his stepson was doing but did nothing about it, was given a
two-year suspended sentence.
	   The elder Schmidt had also admitted in court that he told those
carrying out the arson where to find the house in Dolgenbrodt, a
lakeside resort village of 250 people southeast of Berlin.
	   The two had previously denied any role in the Nov. 1, 1992 fire,
which destroyed the newly constructed refugee home the night before
86 Africans were to move in. No one was injured.
	   The alleged ringleader, Thomas Oste, 41, also received a
two-year suspended sentence and must perform 50 hours of community
work.
	   He admitted in court last week that he paid 11,000 marks (dlrs
6,000) to have a neo-Nazi set the blaze and keep quiet about it.
Oste, whose house was next to the refugee home, said he had feared
for his family if the Africans moved in.
	   Gerd Graefen, a 50-year-old electrician and neighbor of Oste was
also given a two-year suspended sentence, after admitting in court
last week that he gave Oste 300 marks (dlrs 165) to help pay for
the arson. He apologized to the court, saying he knew he was wrong.
	   The court decided Friday to cut a fifth man from the case and
drop charges against him for helping set the fire.
	   Renato Paschke, 27, was already serving a long sentence on a
robbery conviction and his testimony would have not changed the
outcome of the trial, the court said.
	   Paschke was a friend of Silvio Jaskowski, who was arrested in
May 1993 in the case. He was convicted in a 1996 trial and given a
two-year suspended sentence.
	   Based on information from Jaskowski, 18, at the time of the fire
and a neo-Nazi, prosecutors uncovered what proved to be a
conspiracy involving not only disaffected youths but also otherwise
upstanding citizens who wanted to keep the asylum-seekers out.
	   The case underlined how deeply rooted fear of foreigners in the
eastern German states remains following unification and their
struggle to overcome 45 years of communist domination that shut
them off from the rest of the world.

Maradona finally makes it to the World Cup _ as a commentator
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: INSERTS new third graf to include explanation of ``Hand of
God'' goal. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ If it were up to Diego Maradona, there would be a
``Hand of God II.''
	   Before leaving Buenos Aires to fly to the World Cup, the
Argentine superstar said that, despite British media reports to the
contrary, he had ``never'' apologized for the famous ``Hand of
God'' goal that helped Argentina beat England 2-1 at the 1986 World
Cup in Mexico.
	   Maradona instead described the goal as an ``astute'' play, which
he ``would repeat, not only against England, but against any team
in the world.''
	   The goal was one of the most famous in World Cup history. With
the World Cup quarterfinal tied 0-0, Maradona fisted a ball into
the goal on what appeared to the referee to be a header. When asked
later if he touched the ball with his hand, he replied that it was
the ``hand of God'' that touched the ball.
	   Maradona, who retired last year at 37, will serve as a
commentator for Argentine television during his stay at France 98.
He had postponed his trip several times, saying he was too
depressed to travel because he wasn't able to play in a World Cup
for the first time since 1982 and because he recently received a
two-year, 10-month suspended jail sentence for injuring a reporter
with an air rifle in 1994.
	   Maradona left the 1994 World Cup in the United States in
disgrace after being banned from the tournament after testing
positive for stimulants.
	   This time he made a quiet entrance, avoiding a crowd of waiting
journalists as he arrived Friday morning at Charles de Gaulle
airport. He planned to attend the France-Italy quarterfinal game
Friday afternoon at Saint-Denis on the outskirts of Paris and then
travel to Marseille, where Argentina plays the Netherlands on
Saturday.
	   Before boarding his plane in Buenos Aires, Maradona predicted
Italy would beat France and that Argentina would eliminate the
Netherlands. He picked Argentina and Italy as the most likely
finalists.

Social Democrats to seek support from conservatives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - The leading center-left party said
Friday they might seek support from the conservatives if their
negotiations with a small center-right party fails to produce a
minority government.
	   The center-left Social Democrats won early elections June 19-20,
but secured only 74 seats in the 200-seat legislature and lack any
center-left allies that would give them the majority needed to form
a government.
	   In coalition negotiations so far, the Social Democrats have
leaned towards producing a two-party minority with the Christian
Democrats, but should that fail, they are talking of seeking
support from the conservative Civic Democratic Party, an option
that had previously been ruled out on both sides.
	   ``We've met (with the Civic Democratic Party) to start
consultations about drafting an agreement which would stabilize the
political environment in the Czech Republic,'' Social Democratic
leader Milos Zeman said after talks with the Civic Democratic
Party's officials.
	   Civic Democratic Party's leader, ex-premier Vaclav Klaus said
after talks with Zeman that the two sides have met to find out
whether it was possible to find ``some possibility of forming a
government on a minority principle,'' but didn't give more details.
	   The two officials will meet again next Tuesday.
	   If Zeman can't come up with a stable government by next week,
President Vaclav Havel is expected to ask Klaus, whose party won 63
seats, to attempt the same.
	   Earlier Friday, Klaus met with chairmen of two small
center-right parties, the Christian Democrats and the Freedom
Union, for consultations on a possible formation of a center-right
coalition.
	   Civic Democratic Party announced a number of conditions it says
other parties must agree to before it will join any center-right
coalition.
	   The conditions include a demand that Klaus's party be given the
post of Prime Minister and a majority of seats in a future
government and that future state budget be balanced.
	   Christian Democratic leader Josef Lux called the conditions a
``dictate'' and said there would be ``very little space for further
negotiations.''
	   Czech parliamentary elections were held two years early, in
hopes of creating a stable government after Klaus' minority
government collapsed following a financial scandal.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ With five goals each and atop the scorers list
heading into Friday's quarterfinals, Italy's Christian Vieri and
Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta topped the list of 61 finalists for
the World Cup all-star team, the award's sponor MasterCard
announced Friday.
	   Eighteen-year-old Michael Owen of England, who had only three
caps coming into France 98, was among the 17 strikers selected,
along with teammates Alan Shearer and Paul Ince.
	   Ince was one of 24 midfielders chosen, along with five wing
defenders, 10 sweeper-central defenders, and five goalkeepers.
	   Nineteen of the 32 teams were represented on the list, with the
host French leading the way with eight. Four-time and defending
champion Brazil and the Netherlands each had six and Argentina
followed with five. Denmark, Croatia and England each had four,
while Italy, Romania, and Chile had three each.
	   Paraguay, Germany, Spain, Nigeria, Norway and Mexico had two
each while Yugoslavia, Japan and Morocco had one apiece.
	   The finalists, selected by FIFA's technical study group _ an 11
member panel headed by Jurg Nepfer, head of the world body's
technical department _ will pare the list to 16 following the
semifinals and announce the team July 10, two days before the
final.
	   MasterCard will donate dlrs 50,000 to FIFA's official charity,
SOS Children's Villages, on behalf of the players selected.

Volkswagen buys Rolls-Royce, but what about the brand name?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs version &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Volkswagen AG closed its purchase of Rolls-Royce
Motor Cars Ltd. on Friday, but VW may be missing an important part
that you can't buy in the local auto supply shop _ the legendary
Rolls nameplate.
	   After beating out rival BMW and paying 479 million pounds (dlrs
780 million) for Rolls-Royce, Volkswagen still has no deal to use
the Rolls-Royce name and logo, according to Rolls-Royce PLC, the
jet engine maker that says it still retains control of the brand.
	   ``Volkswagen are aware of our rights to the name and
trademark,'' Rolls-Royce PLC spokesman Martin Brodie said. ``We've
not had any detailed discussions.''
	   Rolls-Royce PLC would not say whether it would try to block
Volkswagen's use of the name or whether it might try to force the
German company to pay for the right.
	   ``We attach the greatest importance to the preservation and
protection of the Rolls-Royce name and trademarks as key assets of
our business, and we'll take whatever action is necessary and
appropriate'' to ensure that Rolls-Royce PLC shareholders don't
lose out, Brodie said.
	   Volkswagen spokesman Kurt Rippholz declined to discuss the name
and trademark issue earlier in the week. No one at Volkswagen's
press office was available for immediate comment Friday afternoon,
according to a receptionist at the company's headquarters in
Wolfsburg.
	   Vickers PLC, the British engineering group that sold
Rolls-Royce, has said the old deal giving Rolls-Royce PLC the right
to veto a foreign purchase of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars is
unenforceable under current European Union law.
	   Rolls-Royce PLC retained the rights to the name when the two
Rolls-Royce companies were separated in the 1970s.
	   Volkswagen clinched the purchase last month when Vickers
shareholders approved its bid of 430 million pounds (dlrs 710
million) over BMW's offer of 340 million pounds (dlrs 560 million).
	   The final price was higher. Both bidders had agreed to pay
Vickers a bit extra on closing to account for an increase in the
value of assets at Rolls-Royce since the first of the year.
	   ``This is a splendid outcome for all concerned,'' said Sir Colin
Chandler, the Vickers chairman. Chandler had come under sharp
attack from small shareholders who were outraged last month to see
their beloved Rolls-Royce cars being sold off to the Germans.
	   ``Vickers has secured excellent value for its shareholders from
the transaction and a strong and committed new owner can now take
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars forward to the next stage of its
development,'' Chandler said.
	   Volkswagen's chairman, Ferdinand Piech, said he was ``committed
to building this business in a manner consistent with its character
and heritage.''
	   Volkswagen and Vickers said they hoped soon to close a related
deal for Volkwagen to buy the Cosworth engine-making company.
	   Volkswagen will need the engines. After Vickers agreed to sell
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars to Volkswagen, BMW said it was terminating
an earlier deal to supply engines for some Rolls-Royce cars.
	   Rolls-Royce PLC had favored a sale to BMW, which is its partner
in an unrelated jet engine venture.

Holbrooke arrives in Belgrade for talks with Milosevic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke arrived
in Belgrade Friday to push for a cease-fire in Kosovo and
resumption of talks between President Slobodan Milosevic and Kosovo
ethnic Albanians.
	   Holbrooke was to meet Milosevic later in the evening before
traveling to Kosovo Saturday to meet ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova.
	   During his previous visit to Kosovo last month, Holbrooke met
with representatives from the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army, a militant group fighting for secession of the province from
Serbia, which with Montenegro makes up Yugoslavia.
	   It was not clear whether Holbrooke was planning to meet the KLA
this time. Support for the militants among the majority ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo is growing and their cooperation is essential
in bringing about an end to Kosovo conflict.
	   As Holbrooke arrived in Belgrade, Serb police and the militants
were reportedly battling west of the Kosovo capital of Pristina,
near a strategic village the police recaptured from KLA earlier
Friday.

Army clashes with several rebel groups on different fronts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The Ugandan army and Ugandan rebels
exchanged mortar fire in the jungles of eastern Congo, after rebels
tried to recapture a large base they used for cross-border attacks,
a military source and newspaper report said Friday.
	   The heavy shelling in the Ntabi forests, about 15 kilometers (10
miles) west of the border with Uganda, erupted Tuesday, just two
days after the army captured a nine-camp headquarters belonging to
the Allied Democratic Forces rebels, the state-run New Vision
newspaper cited a senior military official as saying.
	   The ADF was operating from Ntabi, about 375 kilometers (235
miles) west of the Ugandan capital Kampala, to launch cross-border
attacks into Uganda in an effort to destabilize the government of
President Yoweri Museveni.
	   Army acting Chief of Staff James Kazini said Ugandan troops had
captured the ADF headquarters on June 28, after two days of
fighting, the newspaper said.
	   A military source who spoke to The Associated Press on condition
of anonymity, said Ugandan forces were still in control of the
Ntabi headquarters on Friday.
	   Kazini told the newspaper the rebels may have been trying to
recover arms or other equipment they had likely buried there.
	   ``I believe their armory is in Ntabi,'' Kazini said, adding that
apparently the ADF did not expect the Ugandan army to reach them.
	   ``I understand when they learned of our advance to those jungles
they simply brushed it off as nonsense,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile the newspaper reported fighting in northern Uganda
between the army and the Lord's Resistance Army rebels which
operate near the Sudanese border.
	   The New Vision said clashes had erupted in several places along
the Uganda-Sudan border in recent days, but had no details.
	   Officials in the Kitgum district, about 340 kilometers (215
miles) north of Kampala, said the army had launched an offensive to
crack down on LRA rebels who have carried out a series of attacks
in recent weeks, abducting dozens of youngsters at a time.
	   The LRA, as with the ADF, often kidnap children and young adults
and force them to serve as warriors, bearers or sex slaves.

	   Ivanisevic had two match points as he served at 5-4, 40-15 in
the fourth set.
	   The match looked over when he hit a big first serve which
appeared, at first glance, to be an ace, but it was ruled a let by
the umpire.
	   Krajicek started to walk towards the net with his hand extended
as if to congratulate his opponent, while Ivanisevic looked
playfully up at the sky and smiled.
	   When the serve was replayed, Krajicek saved the match point with
a backhand cross-court volley.
	   It was now 40-30, and Ivanisevic had a second chance to end the
match. He double faulted.
	   Krajicek followed with two of his best shots of the match _ a
cross-court backhand pass and a running forehand pass _ to break
for 5-5.
	   After the two held in their next service games, Krajicek won the
tiebreaker to send the match into the decisive fifth set.
	   Surprisingly, Ivanisevic kept his composure and did not fold. He
has long had a reputation as a player who loses his temper and
concentration in crucial moments, but this time he held firm.
	   Even after Krajicek went up a break at 3-2, Ivanisevic did not
panic. He responded by breaking back in the next game.
	   The match then continued on serve, with each player slamming
aces and winners and holding easily.
	   Eventually, Krajicek appeared to run out of steam and Ivanisevic
finally broke through in the 28th game.
	   A backhand chip down the line gave Ivanisevic two match points
at 15-40. Krajicek missed his first serve, and Ivanisevic ripped
back the second, with the Dutchman dumping his volley into the net.

Rand again plunges to record low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The South African currency
plunged to a record low against the U.S. dollar for a second
straight day Friday.
	   Shedding nearly 2 percent of its value during the day, the rand
weakened to 6.37 to the U.S. currency, from 6.26 at the opening of
local trading.
	   The rand had fallen to 6.44 _ it weakest ever _ in the morning
but it soon recovered as speculators backed off and no further
pressure was expected from U.S. money markets, closed ahead of
Saturday's U.S. Independence Day holiday.
	   Commercial banks passed on the higher cost of money to consumers
by hiking their prime lending rate by 1 percent to 23.25 percent
and the base home loan rate by 2 percent to 22 percent, effective
from Saturday.
	   On Thursday, the South African currency fell to 6.35 but then
recovered to 6.26 against the U.S. dollar.
	   Dealers said fluctuations that began a week ago were expected to
continue into next week.
	   The rand has been under pressure because of the global emerging
market crisis sparked by Asia's financial woes. As the rand became
vulnerable, it came under assault by currency speculators.
	   So far this year it has lost about 23 percent of its value
against the U.S. currency, the same amount it lost in the whole of
1996, when the South African currency last lost stability.
	   Since the first all-race elections ended apartheid in 1994 South
Africa has looked for ways to finance and implement sweeping social
reform packages to benefit poor blacks.
	   With a general election looming next year, the governing African
National Congress has been under increasing pressure to speed the
pace of reform.
	   But with the rand crisis could force the government to tighten
fiscal policies.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The father of the man who claimed to
be a nuclear scientist with secret information about Pakistan's
nuclear program said Friday that his son was an accountant at a
company that makes ceramic tiles and bathroom fixtures.
	   In an interview with Pakistan's state-run television, Sikander
Khan said his son, Iftikhar Chaudhary Khan, was not a scientist.
	   ''He never worked as a scientist,'' Khan told Pakistan
Television. ''He was a business commerce student. He didn't study
science.''
	   In interviews in the United States, Khan claimed to be a nuclear
scientist who attended a secret meeting where Pakistan mapped out
plans to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against its uneasy
neighbor India.
	   He said he fled to the United States to protest his country's
plan to be the first to use nuclear weapons. He also promised to
hand over documents to substantiate his claims after being granted
asylum.
	   ''He worked four years as an accountant,'' said his father.
	   Meanwhile, Pakistan urged both Canada and the United States to
investigate how Khan was able to get visas ``when genuine
applicants face hardships getting visas to Western countries.''
	   Canada has said that it's looking into the matter. Khan passed
through Canada on his way to the United States.

Former Chiapas officials face charges in Acteal massacre
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ At least 12 former
officials of the Chiapas state attorney general's office must be
arrested for allegedly failing to stop the December massacre of 45
people, mostly women and children, a Mexican judge said.
	   The arrest warrants accuse the 12 of being aware of the massacre
in Acteal but doing nothing to stop it, an official in the Attorney
General's office said on condition of anonymity.
	   The 12 were said to be in Chenalho, the municipality that
includes Acteal, when the violence occurred. Pro-government
paramilitaries have been blamed for the killings in the village,
whose residents are sympathetic to leftist Zapatista rebels.
	   The warrants, which were issued Tuesday but not publicly
announced, charge the 12 with abuse of authority and dereliction of
duty. The suspects resigned their posts and some apparently fled
after word leaked that they would be charged.
	   The suspects included Deputy Attorney General David Gomez
Hernandez and investigators Felipe Moreno Jimenez, Moises Moreno,
Alfredo Alvares and Manuel Valadez.
	   Moreno Jimenez told The Associated Press that he has sought a
restraining order to fend off arrest.
	   He said he may have been singled out for prosecution because he
is a low-ranking official and, like the paramilitaries and massacre
victims, an Indian.
	   ``Let them punish the other officials, as well. ... It shouldn't
be just me because I'm an Indian,'' Moreno Jimenez said.
	   More than 150 people, including several state police officers,
have been charged or are under investigation for the Dec. 22
killings.
	   Villagers in Acteal back the Zapatista rebels, who staged a
brief uprising in the southern state in January 1994 in the name of
Indian rights and greater democracy. Peace talks between the rebels
and the government have been stalled since 1996.

Briton held in stabbing death of Frenchman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with identity of Briton, security ahead of Saturday's
Germany-Croatia match in Lyon. Has also moved on news wires. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GRENOBLE, France (AP) _ A 43-year-old English fan was to face a
judge Friday on suspicion of stabbing a Frenchman to death after
the England-Argentina World Cup match _ allegedly because he
thought the man was a rival fan mocking him.
	   There was good news, however, from doctors treating the French
policeman who's been in a coma since being clubbed in the head by
German fans wielding a steel pole.
	   Daniel Nivel, also 43, is beginning to respond to certain
stimuli, they said, calling it an ``important and encouraging
step.'' Nivel is being treated at a hospital in Lille in northern
France.
	   The English fan, identified by the British Foreign Office as
Paul Birch, an engineer believed to be from London, is not a known
soccer hooligan.
	   He allegedly stabbed actor Eric Frachet, 33, on the train from
Lyon to Grenoble Tuesday night, following England's defeat in the
game in Saint-Etienne, near Lyon.
	   He was arrested Wednesday night in a Grenoble hotel, following a
dispute with the hotel's night guard. Police quickly linked him to
the stabbing.
	   According to police officials speaking on customary anonymity,
the man was sitting across from Frachet on the train and thought
that the smiling actor was an Argentinian fan mocking him.
	   The man does not appear on the list of known hooligans provided
by Scotland Yard, police said.
	   Meanwhile, authorities stepped up security ahead of Germany's
quarter-final match against Croatia Saturday night in Lyon,
deploying an extra 500 officers in a 2,000-strong force.
	   As has been the case in other high-risk matches, there will be a
strict alcohol ban Saturday night in Lyon, and all bars and
nightclubs are obliged to close at 11:00 p.m.
	   Police have also banned transmission of the match on giant
screens in downtown Lyon, although the measure does not affect
screenings in the city suburbs.
	   Authorities say they expect around 10,000 German fans to come
for the match, including an estimated 100-300 known hooligans, Lyon
police said.

	   Krajicek finished with 42 aces, including 23 in the fifth set.
Ivanisevic had 28 aces.
	   Playing in his 11th Wimbledon, Ivanisevic came in with few
expectations and was overlooked as a serious contender. Ranked No.
25, he was only seeded because of his past record at Wimbledon.
	   Throughout the tournament, Ivanisevic said he was having fun
playing tennis again and felt this could be the time when he
finally wins a Grand Slam.
	   Ivanisevic thoroughly dominated the first two sets, holding
serve with ease and putting pressure on Krajicek's serve with
return winners.
	   Ivanisevic looked set to win in straight sets until Krajicek
broke for the first time in the 12th game of the third. Krajicek
ripped a cross-court pass to get to break point, then took the set
with a stretch forehand which Ivanisevic volleyed wide.
	   The women's finalists, Tauziat, 30, and Novotna, 29, are among
the oldest players on the tour. Together, they represent the oldest
Wimbledon finalists since Betty Stove (32) and Virginia Wade (31)
in 1977.
	   ``Sometimes it seems like the older the better,'' said Martina
Hingis, outplayed by Novotna in straight sets in Thursday's
semifinals. ``If you see Tauziat on the other side in the finals,
it's amazing. I hope it's going to be like that with me also, the
others, the smarter, the cleverer, the better.''
	   It's the second Grand Slam tournament in a row where the
youngsters have been upstaged. At the French Open last month, the
finalists were relative oldtimers Arantxa Sanchez Vicario (27) and
Monica Seles (24).
	   Hingis, 17, was the only teenager to get as far as the Wimbledon
semifinals. Anna Kournikova, 17, missed the tournament with a thumb
injury; Mirjana Lucic, 16, lost in the second round; Serena
Williams, 16, went out in the third, and Venus Williams, 18,
departed in the quarters.
	   ``It doesn't really matter how old you are,'' Novotna said.
``The most important is how you feel. I have been working really
hard.''
	   Age seemed irrelevant Thursday as Novotna covered the court with
ease in her 6-4, 6-4 victory over the defending champion, avenging
a three-set defeat to a 16-year-old Hingis in last year's final.
	   ``Even though I'm one year older than last year, I felt so much
better,'' Novotna said. ``I felt so much younger, really. I said to
myself, `I may be old, but I'm still all over the court.''

Army clashes with several rebel groups on different fronts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The Ugandan army and Ugandan rebels
exchanged mortar fire in the jungles of eastern Congo, after rebels
tried to recapture a large base they used for cross-border attacks,
a military source and newspaper report said Friday.
	   The heavy shelling in the Ntabi forests, about 15 kilometers (10
miles) west of the border with Uganda, erupted Tuesday, just two
days after the army captured a nine-camp headquarters belonging to
the Allied Democratic Forces rebels, the state-run New Vision
newspaper cited a senior military official as saying.
	   The ADF was operating from Ntabi, about 375 kilometers (235
miles) west of the Ugandan capital Kampala, to launch cross-border
attacks into Uganda in an effort to destabilize the government of
President Yoweri Museveni.
	   Army acting Chief of Staff James Kazini said Ugandan troops had
captured the ADF headquarters on June 28, after two days of
fighting, the newspaper said.
	   A military official said Friday Ugandan forces were still in
control of the Ntabi headquarters.
	   Kazini told the newspaper the rebels may have been trying to
recover arms or other equipment they had likely buried there.
	   ``I believe their armory is in Ntabi,'' Kazini said, adding that
apparently the ADF did not expect the Ugandan army to reach them.
	   ``I understand when they learned of our advance to those jungles
they simply brushed it off as nonsense,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile the newspaper reported fighting in northern Uganda
between the army and the Lord's Resistance Army rebels which
operate near the Sudanese border.
	   The New Vision said clashes had erupted in several places along
the Uganda-Sudan border in recent days, but had no details.
	   Officials in the Kitgum district, about 340 kilometers (215
miles) north of Kampala, said the army had launched an offensive to
crack down on LRA rebels who have carried out a series of attacks
in recent weeks, abducting dozens of youngsters at a time.
	   The LRA, as with the ADF, often kidnap children and young adults
and force them to serve as warriors, bearers or sex slaves.

Ivanisevic beats Krajicek to reach final for third time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Combines previous; will be updated with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Goran Ivanisevic squandered two match
points in the fourth set, then outlasted Richard Krajicek 15-13 in
a marathon fifth set Friday to reach the Wimbledon final.
	   Ivanisevic put on an animated display after winning 6-3, 6-4,
5-7, 6-7 (7-5), 15-13 in a match that lasted 3 hours, 22 minutes,
with the final set alone going 1:19.
	   He fell to his knees, tapped the grass with his hand and held
his clenched fists in the air when Krajicek _ the 1996 champion _
netted a backhand volley to end the match in the 28th game of the
final set.
	   The Croatian ripped off his bandana, tossed two towels into the
stands, clapped to the crowd and held up his left index finger in a
No. 1 salute as he walked off the Centre Court.
	   Ivanisevic reached the final for the third time, having lost in
the 1992 and 1994 championship matches. He has never won a Grand
Slam title and came into this tournament after winning only one
match in his five previous Slam events.
	   The 14th-seeded Croatian will face the winner of the second
semifinal between defending champion Pete Sampras and Britain's Tim
Henman.
	   Sampras, who hasn't dropped a set all tournament, is seeking his
fifth title in six years, while Henman can become the first British
player to reach the men's final since 1938.
	   The women's final is set for Saturday, with Jana Novotna facing
Nathalie Tauziat.
	   Ivanisevic had two match points as he served at 5-4, 40-15 in
the fourth set.
	   The match looked over when he hit a big first serve which
appeared, at first glance, to be an ace, but it was ruled a let by
the umpire.
	   Krajicek started to walk towards the net with his hand extended
as if to congratulate his opponent, while Ivanisevic looked
playfully up at the sky and smiled.
	   When the serve was replayed, Krajicek saved the match point with
a backhand cross-court volley.
	   It was now 40-30, and Ivanisevic had a second chance to end the
match. He double faulted.
	   Krajicek followed with two of his best shots of the match _ a
cross-court backhand pass and a running forehand pass _ to break
for 5-5.
	   After the two held in their next service games, Krajicek won the
tiebreaker to send the match into the decisive fifth set.
	   Surprisingly, Ivanisevic kept his composure and did not fold. He
has long had a reputation as a player who loses his temper and
concentration in crucial moments, but this time he held firm.
	   Even after Krajicek went up a break at 3-2, Ivanisevic did not
panic. He responded by breaking back in the next game.
	   The match then continued on serve, with each player slamming
aces and winners and holding easily.
	   Eventually, Krajicek appeared to run out of steam and Ivanisevic
finally broke through in the 28th game.
	   A backhand chip down the line gave Ivanisevic two match points
at 15-40. Krajicek missed his first serve, and Ivanisevic ripped
back the second, with the Dutchman dumping his volley into the net.
	   Krajicek finished with 42 aces, including 23 in the fifth set.
Ivanisevic had 28 aces.
	   Playing in his 11th Wimbledon, Ivanisevic came in with few
expectations and was overlooked as a serious contender. Ranked No.
25, he was only seeded because of his past record at Wimbledon.
	   Throughout the tournament, Ivanisevic said he was having fun
playing tennis again and felt this could be the time when he
finally wins a Grand Slam.
	   Ivanisevic thoroughly dominated the first two sets, holding
serve with ease and putting pressure on Krajicek's serve with
return winners.
	   Ivanisevic looked set to win in straight sets until Krajicek
broke for the first time in the 12th game of the third. Krajicek
ripped a cross-court pass to get to break point, then took the set
with a stretch forehand which Ivanisevic volleyed wide.
	   The women's finalists, Tauziat, 30, and Novotna, 29, are among
the oldest players on the tour. Together, they represent the oldest
Wimbledon finalists since Betty Stove (32) and Virginia Wade (31)
in 1977.
	   ``Sometimes it seems like the older the better,'' said Martina
Hingis, outplayed by Novotna in straight sets in Thursday's
semifinals. ``If you see Tauziat on the other side in the finals,
it's amazing. I hope it's going to be like that with me also, the
others, the smarter, the cleverer, the better.''
	   It's the second Grand Slam tournament in a row where the
youngsters have been upstaged. At the French Open last month, the
finalists were relative oldtimers Arantxa Sanchez Vicario (27) and
Monica Seles (24).
	   Hingis, 17, was the only teenager to get as far as the Wimbledon

injury; Mirjana Lucic, 16, lost in the second round; Serena

departed in the quarters.
	   ``It doesn't really matter how old you are,'' Novotna said.
``The most important is how you feel. I have been working really
hard.''
	   Age seemed irrelevant Thursday as Novotna covered the court with
ease in her 6-4, 6-4 victory over the defending champion, avenging
a three-set defeat to a 16-year-old Hingis in last year's final.
	   ``Even though I'm one year older than last year, I felt so much
better,'' Novotna said. ``I felt so much younger, really. I said to
myself, `I may be old, but I'm still all over the court.''

Mexican police evict 100 families from illegal shantytown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A hundred families who say they paid a local
official for the right to live on Mexican government property have
been evicted from the land and had their makeshift homes destroyed,
a report said Friday.
	   About 250 police officers raided the property on Thursday and
gave the families one hour to abandon their shantytown outside of
Puebla, 65 miles (105 kilometers) southeast of Mexico City, the
daily La Jornada reported.
	   The National Water Commission said the eviction was necessary
because the shantytown, built at the edge of Guadalupe canyon,
would be at risk during the coming rainy season.
	   The families protested that they each had paid 1,000 pesos (dlrs
112), to neighborhood president Miguel Angel Solis earlier this
year for permission to build their cardboard and sheet-metal homes.
	   Last week, a prospective mayoral candidate for the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party told residents that they would
receive electricity and water services, the report said.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Olympic and world 100-meter champion
Linford Christie won a libel suit Friday but the legal battle to
clear his name may cost him financially.
	   Christie won his libel action against convicted armed robber
turned writer John McVicar over an article which alleged the former
sprinter used performance-enhancing drugs.
	   He was also suing printers and distributors of the now defunct
Spiked magazine, which published McVicar's article ``How did
Linford get this good?'' in Septmeber 1995.
	   The 1992 Olympic gold medalist and 1995 world champion was
awarded 40,000 pounds (dlrs 66,400) damages against the printers
and distributors.
	   The judge ruled his legal costs _ estimated at 200,000 pounds
(dlrs 332,000) _ be paid by McVicar.
	   But McVicar, who said he did not regret writing the article,
later indicated he would appeal the order for costs and it was
unclear if he would be capable of paying the damages.
	   The printers also are reported to be seeking legal costs against
Christie.
	   The 38-year-old retired athlete said he was more concerned about
his good reputation than an the money.
	   ``This was never about damages _ it was about my reputation. My
reputation is very important to me,'' he said.
	   ``I have always been clean,'' he added.
	   A jury of six men and six women returned a verdict against
McVicar following a 14-day High Court hearing in London.
	   The jury took less than five hours to decide that McVicar's
article was libelous.

Finnish, Swedish fight over decades old champagne on seabed

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A court order Friday heated up a fight
over thousands of liters (quarts) of vintage champagne and cognac
in a shipwreck near the Finnish coast, claimed by diving groups
from Sweden and Finland.
	   The order, by a district court in southwestern Finland, said a
Finnish team which has diving gear and a vessel over the
90-year-old wreck should remove all its equipment from the area,
some 20 kilometers (12 miles) off the coast.
	   Swedish divers located the wreck of the Joenkoeping schooner
last year after a Finnish trawler reported its nets were entangled
in an underwater obstacle at a depth of 64 meters (211 feet).
	   The 20-meter (66-feet) ship, which was torpedoed by a German
U-boat in 1916, went down with a cargo that included 44 crates of
champagne, 67 barrels of cognac and 17 barrels of port wine. The
consignment, currently valued at some 5 million markkaa (dlrs 1
million), had been ordered by Russia's czarist army.
	   ``The court order means nothing,'' said Peter Fryckman, a
businessman who is backing the Finnish diving team. ``Our diving
expeditions will continue as before.''
	   Fryckman claims the treasure because the company of his great
grandfather, Sven Gustav Fryckman, was involved in delivering the
order.
	   The Bank of Finland, which supervised the monetary transfer of
the deal in 1916, said the ownership of the cargo has not been
determined.
	   ``It's a very tricky question and certainly the bank has no
evidence that Fryckman owns the cargo,'' said Arno Lindgren, head
of legal affairs at the Bank of Finland. ``Other companies also
were involved.''
	   Police in Uusikaupunki, 240 kilometers (150 miles) northwest of
Helsinki, are responsible for keeping the peace over the wreck in
the Gulf of Finland.
	   ``We are worried. There's a lot of tension out there between the
Finnish and Swedish diving groups,'' said Police Chief Inspector
Pentti Koski.
	   Finnish divers do not need permission to dive because the wreck
lies in the country's regional waters.
	   On Thursday, the Swedish C-Star group, which has diving
permission until the end of the year, arrived with a vessel to
float the Joenkoeping, Koski said. But their efforts were blocked
by Fryckman's ship.
	   ``It seems to be a total stalemate,'' Koski said. ``Let's hope
everyone can keep a cool head.''
	   Since the wreck was found, the C-Star group and Fryckman's team
have salvaged several hundred bottles of 1907 Gout American
champagne.
	   ``It's good stuff and there's plenty more down there,'' Fryckman
said. ``We plan to bring the whole lot up.''

Eager to hang convicts, Caribbeans getting rid of British colonial

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ Eager to hang convicted murderers
despite opposition from Britain, four leading Caribbean countries
agreed to get rid of their British law lords and form their own
court.
	   Britain's House of Lords is happy about it, keen to relieve
itself of the increasing cost of leftover appendages that once made
fortunes for the empire.
	   Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad hope to establish the
Caribbean Court of Justice next year, Trinidad Prime Minister
Basdeo Panday told reporters Thursday night.
	   The four countries will change their constitutions to free
themselves of the Privy Council of the House of Lords, the final
legal arbiter for current and former British colonies in the
Caribbean.
	   An overwhelming majority of leaders attending the 16-member
Caribbean Community summit this week supported the idea, Panday
said.
	   The move would cut a colonial link dating to 1833 and end a
hiatus on hanging that has lasted as long as 10 years.
	   It arose from British pressure to abolish the death penalty in
the Caribbean, a political embarrassment to Britain since it is
part of the European Union which considers state executions a
violation of human rights.
	   Using a legal ploy to stop the hangings, the Privy Council in
1993 ruled that it was inhumane to execute people who had waited on
death row more than five years. It recommended commuting their
sentences to life in prison.
	   Hundreds of convicted murderers were spared, since appeals can
drag on for a decade and longer.
	   Yet local polls consistently show most Caribbean people favor
the death penalty. Their numbers have grown because of a surge in
violent crime related to drug trafficking from South America to the
United States and Europe.
	   ``We don't want anybody lecturing us about human rights,''
Guyanese Foreign Minister Clement Rohee said bluntly.
	   In Barbados, Attorney General David Simmons recently said the
British ``have infuriated populations who see their governments
rendered virtually powerless by decisions of legal policy set for
Caribbean countries sitting in London and applying British and
Eurocentric notions.''
	   Britain tried to sweeten the pill when it explored ways to
improve its relations with its colonies earlier this year. It said
it would give the colonies full British citizenship under certain
conditions _ including the abolition of the death penalty.
	   That posed a quandary for places like Bermuda, where islanders
have voted in referendums to stay British and keep the death
penalty.
	   Caribbean attorneys general went to London to ask how officials
felt about cutting court ties. ``The Privy Council was overly
anxious to get rid of their jurisdiction,'' Panday said. ``It's
costly.''
	   Jamaica and Trinidad are shedding other foreign constraints to
hanging.
	   Jamaica, which has commuted 105 death sentences since 1993 and
has 47 inmates on death row, this year withdrew from the
Organization of American States' Inter-American Court on Human
Rights. Eager to resume executions after a decade-long hiatus, it
said the court took too long to hear inmates' appeals.
	   Trinidad, which plans to hang five convicted murderers, says it
will withdraw from the court next year.
	   Opposition to a Caribbean court has come from a few opposition
parties and law associations that argue it would serve the
political interests of individual governments that appoint its
judges.
	   Prime Minister Keith Mitchell of Grenada dismissed the concerns.
``What standards are you going to use? British? American?'' he
asked. ``The role of politicians in the judicial process exists
there, and everywhere. We have to have confidence in ourselves. We
have to take the responsibility for our own management into our own
hands.''

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ More than 100 years after they
left New Zealand as 19th century curios, 11 tattooed Maori heads,
known as moko mokai, were welcomed home in Wellington on Friday as
the treasured remains of ancestors.
	   At a ceremony in Wellington, boxes containing the heads were
ceremonially returned to the Te Papa national museum, thanks to an
agreement with British institutions.
	   Maori Affairs Minister Tau Henare led a delegation to Britain to
recover the heads, which were sometimes collected by bounty hunters
for supposedly scientific purposes.
	   The heads, eight of which came from Edinburgh University's
anatomy department and three from museums in Scarborough and Whitby
in northeast England, are part of collections of hundreds of Maori
curios held in European museums.
	   Edinburgh University has agreed to return its collection of more
than 200 other skeletal remains later this year.
	   Henare said Friday that he hoped his visit to Britain would
clear the way for further repatriation of moko mokai and other
Maori artifacts held overseas.
	   ``While governments have a role to play in facilitating their
return, the onus is still largely on museums, private collectors
and various establishments which still hold our ancestral remains
to voluntarily relinquish themselves of these taonga (artifacts),''
Hence said.

British families of hostages in Chechnya appeal to prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The families of two British charity workers taken
hostage a year ago in the breakaway Russian state of Chechnya
appealed to the British government Friday to use all its diplomatic
powers to ensure their release.
	   Relatives of Camilla Carr and John James paid a visit to Prime
Minister Tony Blair's 10 Downing St. residence and met with
Baroness Symons, a Foreign Office minister. They also released 52
purple balloons to mark the couple's 52 weeks in captivity.
	   Ms. Carr and James were taken captive on July 4, 1997, while on
a charitable mission in Chechnya with a Quaker affiliate, The
Center for Peacemaking and Community Development.
	   Raj Carr said the families were satisfied the Foreign Office was
doing all it could to help his sister and her boyfriend.
	   He said a letter the families gave Blair's office included an
appeal that Britain and other European countries pay no ransom for
hostages.
	   ``Emotionally, we say, `Yes, pay up and bring them back,' '' he
said. `But rationally, we say `no.' ''
	   Blair had already written the families, promising his government
would work to bring the hostages home. Friday, he again wrote,
saying, ``I want you to know that we are all thinking of you today
as you prepare to mark one long, long, terrible year. Like you, we
want them back safe and sound as soon as possible.''

Ivanisevic beats Krajicek to reach final for third time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ivanisevic quotes; edits to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Goran Ivanisevic squandered two match
points in the fourth set, then outlasted Richard Krajicek 15-13 in
a marathon fifth set Friday to reach the Wimbledon final.
	   Ivanisevic put on an animated display after winning 6-3, 6-4,
5-7, 6-7 (7-5), 15-13 in a match that lasted 3 hours, 22 minutes,
with the final set alone going 1:19.
	   He fell to his knees, tapped the grass with his hand and held
his clenched fists in the air when Krajicek _ the 1996 champion _
netted a backhand volley to end the match in the 28th game of the
final set.
	   The Croatian ripped off his bandana, tossed two towels into the
stands, clapped to the crowd and held up his left index finger in a
No. 1 salute as he walked off the Centre Court.
	   ``The fifth set was a just a horror-thriller,'' he said. ``I
never saw somebody serving like that in my life. They were just
bombs. I couldn't even react. I said, `Just keep your serve. He has
to miss a couple of first serves.' And that happened at 13-14.''
	   Ivanisevic reached the final for the third time, having lost in
the 1992 and 1994 championship matches. He has never won a Grand
Slam title and came into this tournament after winning only one
match in his five previous Slam events.
	   The 14th-seeded Croatian will face the winner of the second
semifinal between defending champion Pete Sampras and Britain's Tim
Henman.
	   Sampras, who hasn't dropped a set all tournament, is seeking his
fifth title in six years, while Henman can become the first British
player to reach the men's final since 1938.
	   The women's final is set for Saturday, with Jana Novotna facing
Nathalie Tauziat.
	   Playing in his 11th Wimbledon, Ivanisevic came in with few
expectations and was overlooked as a serious contender. Ranked No.
25, he was only seeded because of his past record at Wimbledon.
	   ``This means a lot,'' he said. ``A lot of people said, `He's
gone. He's never going to be back.' But I worked hard the last six
months and Wimbledon came at the right time.''
	   Ivanisevic said he was having fun playing tennis again and was
determined to rid himself of the tag ``best player never to have
won a major.''
	   ``I think it's time to change on Sunday,'' he said.
	   The most surprising aspect of Ivanisevic's victory was how he
didn't lose his temper, his concentratation or his composure after
missing the two match points in the fourth set and going down a
break in the fifth.
	   ``I don't think anybody bet on me when I lost the fourth set,''
he said. ``People thought, `he's gone, he's going to lose it.' ...
I was just mentally very strong today. Never like this in my life.
I just believed I was going to win it.''
	   The two wasted match points came with Ivanisevic serving at 5-4,
40-15 in the fourth set.
	   Both players thought the match was over when he hit a big first
serve which appeared, at first glance, to be an ace. But it was
ruled a let by the umpire.
	   Krajicek had started walking towards the net to congratulate
Ivanisevic. When he heard the let ruling, he smiled and held out
his hand in gest. Ivanisevic looked playfully up at the sky and
smiled.
	   When the serve was replayed, Krajicek saved the match point with
a backhand cross-court volley.
	   It was now 40-30, and Ivanisevic had a second chance to end the
match. He double faulted.
	   Krajicek followed with two of his best shots of the match _ a
cross-court backhand pass and a running forehand pass _ to break
for 5-5.
	   After the two held in their next service games, Krajicek won the
tiebreaker to send the match into the decisive fifth set.
	   Even after Krajicek went up a break at 3-2, Ivanisevic did not
panic. He responded by breaking back in the next game.
	   The match then continued on serve, with each player slamming
aces and winners and holding easily.
	   Eventually, Krajicek appeared to run out of steam and Ivanisevic
finally broke through in the 28th game.
	   A backhand chip down the line gave Ivanisevic two match points
at 15-40. Krajicek missed his first serve, and Ivanisevic ripped
back the second, with the Dutchman dumping his volley into the net.
	   Krajicek finished with 42 aces, including 23 in the fifth set.
Ivanisevic had 28 aces and 16 double faults.
	   Ivanisevic thoroughly dominated the first two sets, holding
serve with ease and putting pressure on Krajicek's serve with
return winners.
	   Ivanisevic looked set to win in straight sets until Krajicek
broke for the first time in the 12th game of the third. Krajicek
ripped a cross-court pass to get to break point, then took the set
with a stretch forehand which Ivanisevic volleyed wide.
	   The women's finalists, Tauziat, 30, and Novotna, 29, are among
the oldest players on the tour. Together, they represent the oldest
Wimbledon finalists since Betty Stove (32) and Virginia Wade (31)
in 1977.
	   ``Sometimes it seems like the older the better,'' said Martina
Hingis, outplayed by Novotna in straight sets in Thursday's
semifinals. ``If you see Tauziat on the other side in the finals,
it's amazing. I hope it's going to be like that with me also, the
others, the smarter, the cleverer, the better.''
	   It's the second Grand Slam tournament in a row where the
youngsters have been upstaged. At the French Open last month, the
finalists were relative oldtimers Arantxa Sanchez Vicario (27) and
Monica Seles (24).
	   Hingis, 17, was the only teenager to get as far as the Wimbledon
semifinals. Anna Kournikova, 17, missed the tournament with a thumb
injury; Mirjana Lucic, 16, lost in the second round; Serena
Williams, 16, went out in the third, and Venus Williams, 18,
departed in the quarters.

<TEXT>
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ Eager to hang convicted murderers
despite opposition from Britain, four leading Caribbean countries
agreed to get rid of their British law lords and form their own
court.
	   Britain's House of Lords is happy about it, keen to relieve
itself of the increasing cost of islands that once made fortunes
for the empire.
	   Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad hope to establish the
Caribbean Court of Justice next year, Trinidad Prime Minister
Basdeo Panday said Thursday.
	   The four countries will change their constitutions to free
themselves of the Privy Council of the House of Lords, the final
legal arbiter for current and former British colonies in the
Caribbean.
	   An overwhelming majority of leaders attending the 16-member
Caribbean Community summit this week supported the idea, Panday
said.
	   The move would cut a colonial link dating to 1833 and end a
hiatus on hanging that has lasted as long as 10 years.
	   It arose from British pressure to abolish the death penalty in
the Caribbean, a political embarrassment to Britain since it is
part of the European Union, which considers state executions a
violation of human rights.
	   Using a legal ploy to stop the hangings, the Privy Council in
1993 ruled that it was inhumane to execute people who had waited on
death row more than five years. It recommended commuting their
sentences to life in prison.
	   Hundreds of convicted murderers were spared, since appeals can
drag on for a decade and longer.
	   Yet local polls consistently show that most Caribbean people
favor the death penalty. Their numbers have grown because of a
surge in violent crime related to drug trafficking from South
America to the United States and Europe.
	   ``We don't want anybody lecturing us about human rights,''
Guyanese Foreign Minister Clement Rohee said bluntly.
	   In Barbados, Attorney General David Simmons recently said the
British ``have infuriated populations who see their governments
rendered virtually powerless by decisions of legal policy set for
Caribbean countries sitting in London and applying British and
Eurocentric notions.''
	   Britain tried to sweeten the pill when it explored ways to
improve its relations with its colonies earlier this year. It said
it would give the colonies full British citizenship under certain
conditions _ including abolition of the death penalty.
	   That posed a quandary for places like Bermuda, where islanders
have voted in referendums to stay British and keep the death
penalty.
	   Caribbean attorneys general went to London to ask how officials
felt about cutting court ties. ``The Privy Council was overly
anxious to get rid of their jurisdiction,'' Panday said. ``It's
costly.''
	   Jamaica and Trinidad are shedding other foreign constraints to
hanging.
	   Jamaica, which has commuted 105 death sentences since 1993 and
has 47 inmates on death row, this year withdrew from the
Organization of American States' Inter-American Court on Human
Rights. Eager to resume executions after a decade-long hiatus, it
said the court took too long to hear inmates' appeals.
	   Trinidad, which plans to hang five convicted murderers, says it
will withdraw from the court next year.
	   Opposition to a Caribbean court has come from a few opposition
parties and law associations that argue it would serve the
political interests of individual governments that appoint its
judges.
	   Prime Minister Keith Mitchell of Grenada dismissed the concerns.
``What standards are you going to use? British? American?'' he
asked. ``The role of politicians in the judicial process exists
there, and everywhere. We have to have confidence in ourselves. We
have to take the responsibility for our own management into our own
hands.''

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The father of the man who claimed to
be a nuclear scientist with secret information about Pakistan's
nuclear program said Friday that his son was an accountant at a
company that makes ceramic tiles and bathroom fixtures.
	   In an interview with Pakistan's state-run television, Sikander
Khan said his son, Iftikhar Chaudhary Khan, was not a scientist.
	   ''He never worked as a scientist,'' Khan told Pakistan
Television. ''He was a business commerce student. He didn't study
science.''
	   In interviews in the United States, Khan claimed to be a nuclear
scientist who attended a secret meeting where Pakistan mapped out
plans to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against its uneasy
neighbor India.
	   He said he fled to the United States to protest his country's
plan to be the first to use nuclear weapons. He also promised to
hand over documents to substantiate his claims after receiving
asylum.
	   ''He worked four years as an accountant,'' said his father.
	   In New York, Khan's lawyer, Michael Wildes, said he filed
Thursday for political asylum for his client, claiming his life
would be in danger if he returned to Pakistan.
	   ``He defected for political reasons. We believe he has a
reasonable fear of persecution ... if he were to return to
Pakistan. He would be executed,'' Wildes said.
	   Wildes dismissed as ''preposterous'' Pakistani claims that his
client was an accountant and said it was not unexpected that
Pakistan officials would deny his client's statements.
	   ''They were very embarrassed over my client's defection,'' he
said.
	    &UR; Meanwhile, Pakistan ... PICKUP 7th graf pvs.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The father of a Pakistani man who
claims to be a nuclear scientist with secret information about
plans to bomb India said Friday his son worked for a company that
makes bathroom fixtures.
	   Iftikhar Chaudhary Khan ``never worked as a scientist,'' his
father, Sikander Khan, told Pakistan Television in an interview.
``He was a business commerce student. He didn't study science.''
	   ``He worked four years as an accountant,'' the father said.
	   Khan, who is in New York seeking asylum, claims to be a nuclear
scientist who attended a secret meeting where Pakistan mapped out
plans to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against rival India.
	   Khan said he fled to the United States to protest the plans and
promised to hand over documents to substantiate his claims after
being granted asylum.
	   Khan's lawyer, Michael Wildes, said he filed for political
asylum for his client Thursday.
	   Wildes said claims that his client was only an accountant were
``preposterous'' and said it was not unexpected that the Pakistan
government would deny his client's story.
	   ``They (Pakistani officials) were very embarrassed over my
client's defection,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Pakistan urged the United States and Canada to
investigate how a ``trickster got a visa when genuine applicants
face hardships getting visas to Western countries.''
	   Information Minister Mushahid Hussein, whose comments were
carried by the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan news agency,
said the Pakistan government was also carrying out its own
investigation.
	   Hussein called Khan's allegations ``a false story aimed at
maligning Pakistan and exacerbating tension in the region.''
	   Asad Gulzar Sheikh, director of Forte Trading Company Limited,
which makes ceramic tile and bathroom fixtures, said Thursday he
was Khan's boss for four years until November 1997, when Khan
resigned.
	   Sheikh said Khan was an assistant accountant who earned dlrs 120
a month. It wasn't immediately clear why he resigned.
	   India and Pakistan both conducted underground nuclear tests in
May sparking fears of a nuclear arms race. The two countries have
fought three wars since gaining independence from Britain in 1947.
	   On Thursday, the State Department said it had no information to
support Khan's claims.
	   ``We do note significant discrepancies in his story as reported
in the press,'' said State Department spokesman James Rubin,
declining to elaborate.

Bank shareholders to file suit against New York state and city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A group of Credit Suisse bank
shareholders will file a class-action lawsuit against New York City
and state over the authorities' boycott plans against Swiss banks,
a spokesman for the group said Friday.
	   ``They are blackmailing the Swiss banks, thereby harming the
institutions' reputation and, in turn, damaging our shareholder
value,'' said Marc Fessler, a Credit Suisse shareholder.
	   New York City and state turned up the pressure on Swiss banks
over deadlocked Holocaust talks late Thursday by announcing plans
to withhold business from them.
	   Three Swiss banks made what they said was their final offer of
dlrs 600 million last month. But Jewish leaders claimed that was
far less than the more than dlrs 1 billion the banks should be
paying.
	   Christoph Meier, spokesman for the United Bank of Switzerland,
said Friday the banks' offer is still on the table, but he and
other bank spokesmen declined to comment on the shareholders'
announcement.
	   Fessler, also managing director of the Swiss asset management
company SwiPex AG, plans to launch the suit on the very first day
of the boycott, which authorities in New York say will be September
1.
	   ``We'll only withdraw if our opponents return to the negotiation
table with the banks, or if they drop their plans altogether,''
Fessler said.
	   The class-action suit will be filed in cooperation with a
lawyer's office in the Swiss capital Bern and lawyers in New York,
according to Fessler.
	   While he couldn't specify the amount of damages the group will
seek to recoup in U.S. courts, Fessler said ``the sum will be just
as striking as everything we've so far heard from overseas.''
	   One of the Swiss lawyers said under condition of anonymity that
the sum might be at least dlrs 1 billion. But this lawyer also said
the suit is only being prepared. Many financial questions have to
be addressed first, he said.
	   Despite U.S. government objections, a commission advising
hundreds of city and state finance officials Wednesday opened the
way for sanctions after declaring negotiations between the banks
and Holocaust survivors at an impasse.
	   The commission is chaired by New York City Comptroller Alan
Hevesi, who has been spearheading the sanctions threats.
	   Other states have announced plans for sanctions, but Fessler
said for the moment the shareholder group is focusing only on New
York.
	   New York City and state, which have hundreds of millions of
dollars in pension funds invested in Swiss banks and other
companies, said if there is no settlement by Sept. 1, they will bar
short-term investments with the banks.
	   The banks and Swiss investment firms will also be forbidden from
selling state and city debt, said Hevesi. If the impasse continues,
he said, the bans will be extended to additional Swiss financial
services in November and to all Swiss companies in January.

	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ Eager to hang convicted murderers
despite opposition from Britain, four leading Caribbean countries
agreed to get rid of their British law lords and form their own
court.
	   Britain's House of Lords is happy about it, keen to relieve
itself of the increasing cost of islands that once made fortunes
for the empire.
	   Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad hope to establish the
Caribbean Court of Justice next year, Trinidad Prime Minister
Basdeo Panday said Thursday.
	   The four countries will change their constitutions to free
themselves of the Privy Council of the House of Lords, the final
legal arbiter for current and former British colonies in the
Caribbean.
	   An overwhelming majority of leaders attending the 16-member
Caribbean Community summit this week supported the idea, Panday
said.
	   The move would cut a colonial link dating to 1833 and end a
hiatus on hanging that has lasted as long as 10 years.
	   It arose from British pressure to abolish the death penalty in
the Caribbean, a political embarrassment to Britain since it is
part of the European Union, which considers state executions a
violation of human rights.
	   Using a legal ploy to stop the hangings, the Privy Council in
1993 ruled that it was inhumane to execute people who had waited on
death row more than five years. It recommended commuting their
sentences to life in prison.
	   Hundreds of convicted murderers were spared, since appeals can
drag on for a decade and longer.
	   Yet local polls consistently show that most Caribbean people
favor the death penalty. Their numbers have grown because of a
surge in violent crime related to drug trafficking from South
America to the United States and Europe.
	   ``We don't want anybody lecturing us about human rights,''
Guyanese Foreign Minister Clement Rohee said bluntly.
	   In Barbados, Attorney General David Simmons recently said the
British ``have infuriated populations who see their governments
rendered virtually powerless by decisions of legal policy set for
Caribbean countries sitting in London and applying British and
Eurocentric notions.''
	   Britain tried to sweeten the pill when it explored ways to
improve its relations with its colonies earlier this year. It said
it would give the colonies full British citizenship under certain
conditions _ including abolition of the death penalty.
	   That posed a quandary for places like Bermuda, where islanders
have voted in referendums to stay British and keep the death
penalty.
	   Caribbean attorneys general went to London to ask how officials
felt about cutting court ties. ``The Privy Council was overly
anxious to get rid of their jurisdiction,'' Panday said. ``It's
costly.''
	   Jamaica and Trinidad are shedding other foreign constraints to
hanging.
	   Jamaica, which has commuted 105 death sentences since 1993 and
has 47 inmates on death row, this year withdrew from the
Organization of American States' Inter-American Court on Human
Rights. Eager to resume executions after a decade-long hiatus, it
said the court took too long to hear inmates' appeals.
	   Trinidad, which plans to hang five convicted murderers, says it
will withdraw from the court next year.
	   Opposition to a Caribbean court has come from a few opposition
parties and law associations that argue it would serve the
political interests of individual governments that appoint its
judges.
	   Prime Minister Keith Mitchell of Grenada dismissed the concerns.
``What standards are you going to use? British? American?'' he
asked. ``The role of politicians in the judicial process exists
there, and everywhere. We have to have confidence in ourselves. We
have to take the responsibility for our own management into our own
hands.''

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A court order Friday heated up a fight
over thousands of liters (quarts) of vintage champagne and cognac
in a shipwreck near the Finnish coast, claimed by diving groups
from Sweden and Finland.
	   The order, by a district court in southwestern Finland, said a
Finnish team which has diving gear and a vessel over the
90-year-old wreck should remove all its equipment from the area,
some 20 kilometers (12 miles) off the coast.
	   Swedish divers located the wreck of the Joenkoeping schooner
last year after a Finnish trawler reported its nets were entangled
in an underwater obstacle at a depth of 64 meters (211 feet).
	   The 20-meter (66-feet) ship, which was torpedoed by a German
U-boat in 1916, went down with a cargo that included 44 crates of
champagne, 67 barrels of cognac and 17 barrels of port wine. The
consignment, currently valued at some 5 million markkaa (dlrs 1
million), had been ordered by Russia's czarist army.
	   ``The court order means nothing,'' said Peter Fryckman, a
businessman who is backing the Finnish diving team. ``Our diving
expeditions will continue as before.''
	   Fryckman claims the treasure because the company of his great
grandfather, Sven Gustav Fryckman, was involved in delivering the
order.
	   The Swedish C-Star team maintains its right to the treasure its
divers found the ship which went down in international waters,
since claimed by Finland.
	   The Bank of Finland, which supervised the monetary transfer of
the deal in 1916, said the ownership of the cargo has not been
determined.
	   ``It's a very tricky question and certainly the bank has no
evidence that Fryckman owns the cargo,'' said Arno Lindgren, head
of legal affairs at the Bank of Finland. ``Other companies also
were involved.''
	   Police in Uusikaupunki, 240 kilometers (150 miles) northwest of
Helsinki, are responsible for keeping the peace over the wreck in
the Gulf of Finland.
	   ``We are worried. There's a lot of tension out there between the
Finnish and Swedish diving groups,'' said Police Chief Inspector
Pentti Koski.
	   Finns do not need permission to dive because the wreck lies in
the country's regional waters.
	   On Thursday, the C-Star group, which has diving permission from
Finnish officials until the end of the year, arrived with a vessel
to float the Joenkoeping, Koski said. But their efforts were
blocked by Fryckman's ship.
	   ``It seems to be a total stalemate,'' Koski said. ``Let's hope
everyone can keep a cool head.''
	   Since the wreck was found, the C-Star group and Fryckman's team
have salvaged several hundred bottles of 1907 Gout Americain
champagne.
	   ``It's good stuff and there's plenty more down there,'' Fryckman
said. ``We plan to bring the whole lot up.''

 &UR; Israel, Palestinians trade accusations after Gaza standoff &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and the Palestinians traded blame Friday
after troops from both sides confronted each other with cocked
assault rifles and armored personnel carriers in what started as a
routine argument over control of a Gaza Strip road.
	   The new display of distrust came at a time when the United
States appeared to be making little headway in winning Israeli
agreement to a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested Friday that
the 12-hour showdown in Gaza, during which Palestinian truckers
blockaded Jewish settlements, could make Israel even more hesitant
to hand over land to the Palestinians. Israeli hard-liners claim
that a troop pullback would leave more than a dozen settlements
isolated and at the mercy of the Palestinians.
	   ``You could also understand how sensitive we are to the issue of
redeployment, which could place tens of thousands of Israelis ...
at great peril any time the Palestinians decide to violate the
agreement, as they did last night,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of provocation, and said
Israel would not succumb to threats.
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, dismissed
Netanyahu's accusation, saying the Palestinian Authority had made
every possible effort to defuse the situation.
	   ``He is the one to be blamed for the tense situation'' because
he has refused to live up to Israel's promises, including a troop
pullback, Erekat said.
	   The Gaza confrontation began with a seemingly routine argument
over the use of a road. About two-thirds of the Gaza Strip is
controlled by the Palestinian Authority, but Israeli troops patrol
near Jewish settlements and control several access roads.
	   On Thursday afternoon, Palestinian Supplies Minister Abdel Azziz
Shaheen demanded that Israel allow a convoy of 22 Palestinian cars
to use a coastal route it controls.
	   Israeli soldiers said they would let Shaheen pass because as a
Cabinet minister he has special privileges, but told the others to
turn back.
	   The dispute quickly escalated into scuffles and shouting matches
between Israeli and Palestinian troops. Israeli troops stationed
three APCs on a road linking two major Gaza Strip cities and
created a large traffic jam. In retaliation, Palestinian police
ordered dozens of trucks to block access roads to Jewish
settlements. Israel, in turn, sealed off the Gaza Strip.
	   As night fell, both sides dug roadside trenches and took up
positions just a few dozen meters (yards) from one another, with
rifles pointed.
	   Under a compromise reached early Friday with the help of U.S.
Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross, the Palestinians agreed to move
the trucks from the settlement roads while Israel allowed Shaheen
and his convoy to drive along the coastal road.
	   In other developments Friday:
	   _ Israel's outgoing armed forces chief of staff undercut
Netanyahu's initial claim that a 13 percent troop pullback would
endanger Israel's security, and that Israel could hand over no more
than 9 percent. ``The difference ... between 9 and 13 percent _
it's not that it is trivial, not that it is unimportant _ but it is
certainly not very, very dramatic,'' Lt. Gen. Amnon Shahak told
Israel army radio in a farewell interview.
	   _ Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan, citing an intelligence
report, said 21 prominent Islamic militants have been recruited by
Palestinian police, including six involved in planning suicide
bombings in Israel. If confirmed, the report would undermine
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's claim that he is doing the best
he can to rein in Islamic militants.

Volcano breaks silence, erupts, but does no new damage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OLD TOWNE, Montserrat (AP) _ After months of silence, the
Soufriere Hills volcano erupted Friday morning, sending super-hot
clouds of gas, ash and rocks plunging to the sea but causing no new
damage.
	   ``This is the biggest eruption since December 1997 and has come
after three months of quiet activity by the volcano,'' said Gill
Norton, deputy chief scientist at the Montserrat Volcano
Observatory on this Caribbean island.
	   The dome collapse spewed ash to 45,000 feet and sent a
pyroclastic flow _ a rapid-moving, 1,000-degree Fahrenheit
(550-degree Celsius) rush of gas, ash and rocks _ charging down the
eastern flank of the mountain to the sea.
	   Most of the island has long been evacuated since the volcano
became active in 1995 and no new damage was done. The remaining
residents of the 39-square-mile (101-square-kilometer) island now
live on the northern side.
	   ``The north of the island got a light sprinkling of ash which
has now thankfully been washed away by heavy rains,'' Norton said.
	   Eruptions are normally preceded by earthquake activity or
smaller pyroclastic flows, but this one occurred with no advance
warning, Norton said.
	   Prior to Friday's eruption, which lasted from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m.
local time, the volcano had been almost completely quiet since
early March.

<TEXT>
	   The victory put France, which has never won the tournament it
invented, into the semifinals for the first time since 1986. The
hosts will play either Germany or Croatia on Wednesday at
Saint-Denis.
	   The game marked the second time in as many World Cups that Italy
has been eliminated in a penalty shootout in which an Italian
player missed the last kick. Roberto Baggio sailed an attempt over
the bar in the 1994 final to give Brazil the title.
	   Zinedine Zidane, David Trezeguet, Thierry Henry and Laurent
Blanc made the spot kicks for France. Bixente Lizarazu was the only
Frenchman to miss, striking a tame attempt that was blocked by
goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca.
	   Roberto Baggio, Alessandro Costacurta and Christian Vieri
converted for Italy. French keeper Fabien Barthez saved an attempt
by Demetrio Albertini.

Russian president asks Gazprom to help country's cash crisis

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin tried to smooth over
relations Friday with Gazprom, Russia's largest company, asking the
gas monopoly's help in resolving the government's cash crisis by
paying its back taxes.
	   The president's spin session with the director of Gazprom came
one day after the Kremlin threatened tough action, then had to back
off in an embarrassing about face.
	   Yeltsin used both approaches Friday, asking for Gazprom's help
and at the same time demanding a new payment schedule in 24 hours.
	   Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky described the
meeting as ``a rather hard conversation.''
	   ``The president suggested that a complete solution to the
situation be worked out in one day,'' the spokesman said.
	   Like many Russian companies, Gazprom has trouble paying its
taxes. As a result, the government has trouble paying its own
bills, including wages and pensions.
	   Yeltsin called the cash crisis a ``vicious circle,'' and asked
Gazprom director Rem Vyakhirev to pay taxes even when Gazprom
clients don't pay their bills.
	   ``You have to pay in full, regardless of whether you are being
paid,'' Yeltsin told Vyakhirev in remarks broadcast on television.
``Otherwise, we get a vicious circle.''
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko provoked the fracas Thursday
when he tried to make an example of Gazprom, ordering authorities
to seize the company's property unless it paid overdue June taxes.
	   But Gazprom is revered as one of the few stars in Russia's
tattered economy, and swift denunciations from lawmakers and others
forced Kiriyenko to call off the seizures and reach a quick payment
settlement.
	   He, too, tried to put the best face on the about-face Friday.
	   ``The state has begun enforcing tax payments,'' Kiriyenko told a
news conference. ``Nothing extraordinary is happening.''
	   Kiriyenko is under strong pressure to increase Russia's tax
collections to qualify for a new loan from the International
Monetary Fund that is expected to top dlrs 10 billion.
	   He made clear that the government intends to lean heavily on
other companies as well, including one of Gazprom's chief
customers, the national power utility UES.
	   ``Let's get used to the idea that taxes must be paid,''
Kiriyenko said.
	   Kiriyenko said Gazprom has agreed to pay about 4 billion rubles
(about dlrs 750 million) in taxes each month. It was not clear how
much of that would go to pay its back taxes, which he said were
between 2 billion and 3 billion rubles (dlrs 330 million and dlrs
500 million).
	   The government made clear Friday that it will consider writing
off at least some of the existing debt.
	   Vyakhirev, the Gazprom chief, dashed back to Moscow from a
business trip in Vienna and appeared irked at the whole
controversy, telling reporters it was ``a provocation.''
	   Opposition lawmakers seemed to agree. The State Duma unanimously
passed a resolution calling the government's actions toward Gazprom
``inadmissible'' and vowing to protect the country's so-called
``natural monopolies.''
	   They also took action on several bills that form part of the
government's plan to rescue the Russian economy from its crisis.
They gave preliminary approval to the main part of the government's
new tax code, but rejected a proposed 5 percent sales tax.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov had said the tax would have
brought in 40 billion rubles (about dlrs 7 billion), but many Duma
deputies oppose flat-rate taxes, calling them socially unfair.
	   Gazprom, which has close to 400,000 employees, controls
production and distribution of Russia's vast natural gas supplies,
and is one of Western Europe's largest suppliers.

SAINT-DENIS: Demetrio Albertini.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The shootout, the second of France 98, came after 120 minutes of
rough-and-tumble play dominated statistically by the French, who
took 13 corner kicks to Italy's two and outshot the Italians by
24-7. Italy didn't get its first corner kick until the third minute
of the second-half injury time.
	   But every time the French attack got close, a defender was
always in the way, whether it was Paolo Maldini's slide tackle to
take the ball away from Henry in the 74th minute or Costacurta's
clearing header of Henry's cross in the 82nd. Of France's 24 shots,
only seven were on goal.
	   Baggio came closest to scoring a ``golden goal'' _ a
sudden-death winner _ in the 12th minute of the first extra-time
period when he lofted a one-touch volley across the goal and just
wide left. In the game's 119th minute, Pagliuca emerged from the
net to stop Youri Djorkaeff.
	   The game's best scoring chance came two minutes into first-half
injury time when France's Didier Deschamps fed Djorkaeff in the
penalty area. Djorkaeff, with no one but Pagliuca in front of him,
mis-kicked and pulled the shot wide left.
	   What the game lacked in scoring, it made up for in acrobatic
tackles and dives and their accompanying bumps and bruises. The
worst came in the 33rd minute, when Blanc landed with both feet
flush on the body of teammate Emmanuel Petit after both tried to
block a shot from Vieri.
	   Petit lay in agony before he was taken off on a stretcher,
although he returned to the game less than five minutes later.
	   Stephane Guivarc'h provided another ugly highlight when he
rammed his elbow into Fabio Cannavaro's face to earn one of the
game's five yellow cards in the 53rd minute. There were 50 fouls in
the game.
	   France went on the attack from the opening whistle. Zidane shot
across the goalmouth and Petit had a bicycle kick attempt stopped
by Pagliuca, both in the fifth minute.
	   Italy rarely penetrated the French half of the field in the
first 30 minutes. Its only early scoring chance came on a
counterattack in the ninth, when Vieri had to jump over defender
Lilian Thuram to get his head on Francesco Moriero's cross at the
far post. The Italian striker put the ball just wide left.
	   Henry, who has scored three goals in the tournament, is
suffering from an ankle sprain and did not start. He entered as a
substitute in the 65th minute.

Russia's Rosneft privatization runs into trouble
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The largest planned privatization in Russia's
history ran into more trouble Friday when Royal Dutch-Shell said it
was no longer interested in buying the state-controlled oil
company, NK Rosneft.
	   Analysts say the cash-strapped Russian government has few other
likely bidders for 75 percent of Rosneft, the country's
fifth-largest oil company, and will probably have to change
conditions for the sale or cancel it.
	   The sale was seen as a major test for the government, which has
said it would carry out further privatizations without bestowing
any special favors on the country's politically powerful commercial
banks.
	   The government already canceled one attempt to sell Rosneft this
spring, when bidders said the dlrs 2.1 billion asking price was too
high. It lowered the price to dlrs 1.6 billion in early June, but
the Russian stock market has fallen 25 percent since then.
	   ``It is enough to give anyone second thoughts about whether they
should participate in this,'' said Per Mellstrom, head of research
at Brunswick Warburg brokerage in Moscow. ``I think the
consequences of this may be that the price will have to be cut
further.''
	   Shell had been expected to bid for Rosneft with two Russian
companies _ natural gas monopoly RAO Gazprom and oil giant AO
Lukoil. The government opened bidding last week, and planned to
close it July 16.
	   Neither Gazprom nor Lukoil appear to have the cash to proceed on
its own. Gazprom chief executive Rem Vyakhirev said last month that
his company's participation depended on Shell's actions.
	   Shell blamed the depressed outlook for oil prices, which it said
``does not justify a bid under current conditions.'' Shell also
cited the present difficult financial circumstances in Russia,
which it said would require Shell to finance a major part of the
bid.
	   A British Petroleum Co. PLC-led consortium had earlier indicated
interest in bidding for Rosneft in conjunction with Sidanco,
Russia's fourth-largest oil producer. BP refused to comment on its
plans Friday.

Third Cuban swimmer deserts team, seeks political asylum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A third woman swimmer deserted the
Cuban national team Friday and will seek political asylum in the
United States, she said.
	   Liudmila Montes de Oca, an 18-year-old specialist in the
butterfly from Villa Clara, Cuba, joined two other swimmers who
left their team on Tuesday. The Cuban athletes were among 27 Cuban
swimmers training for this month's Goodwill Games as guests of the
Puerto Rico Swimming Federation.
	   ``I've been thinking about it a long time,'' said Montes de Oca.
She said she left behind a large extended family in Cuba.
	   ``That bothers me, but I know I will get over it,'' she said.
	   Sergio Ramos, a lawyer known for helping Cubans apply for
asylum, said the the first two swimmers, Nubis Rosales and Daimara
Munoz, had applied to the Immigration and Naturalization Service
late Thursday for political asylum. An application on behalf of
Montes de Oca would be made Monday, he said.
	   ``We don't expect they will have any problem in obtaining
political asylum,'' said Ramos.
	   On Thursday, the head coach of the Cuban national swimming team,
said he felt betrayed by the desertions.
	   ``For 10 years I've been training them,'' said Jose Vazquez. ``I
trusted them, and now they've left when the team needed them
most.''
	   Because the athletes entered the United States legally, they do
not face the prospect of being jailed while their cases are
reviewed, as illegal immigrants do.
	   Other Cuban athletes have taken advantage of competitions in the
U.S. commonwealth of Puerto Rico to desert their teams. The latest
was Jose Perez, a runner who won the bronze medal in the 400-meter
hurdles at a meet in San Juan last year.
	   In 1993, 43 Cuban athletes defected during the Central American
and Caribbean Games in the southern city of Ponce.

World Cup: France wins shootout to advance to semis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ France won a penalty shootout 4-3
after a 0-0 tie with Italy on Friday to advance to the semifinals
of the World Cup.
	   Italy's Luigi Di Biagio hit the crossbar with the final spot
kick of the tiebreaker to put France, which has never won the
tournament it invented, into the semifinals for the first time
since 1986.
	   The hosts will play either Germany or Croatia on Wednesday at
Saint-Denis.
	   ``I'm completely exhausted,'' French coach Aime Jacquet said.
``The better team won.''
	   The game marked the second time in as many World Cups that Italy
has been eliminated in a penalty shootout in which an Italian
player missed the last kick. Roberto Baggio sailed an attempt over
the bar in the 1994 final to give Brazil the title.
	   ``We're walking out of this stadium with our heads up,'' Italy
coach Cesare Maldini said. ``It's a pity because it really is a
lottery when you go to a shootout.''
	   Zinedine Zidane, David Trezeguet, Thierry Henry and Laurent
Blanc made the spot kicks for France. Bixente Lizarazu was the only
Frenchman to miss, striking a tame attempt that was blocked by
goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca.
	   Baggio, Alessandro Costacurta and Christian Vieri converted for
Italy. French keeper Fabien Barthez saved an attempt by Demetrio
Albertini.
	   The shootout, the second of France 98, came after 120 minutes of
rough-and-tumble play dominated statistically by the French, who
took 13 corner kicks to Italy's two and outshot the Italians by
24-7. Italy didn't get its first corner kick until the third minute
of the second-half injury time.
	   But every time the French attack got close, a defender was
always in the way, whether it was Paolo Maldini's slide tackle to
take the ball away from Henry in the 74th minute or Costacurta's
clearing header of Henry's cross in the 82nd. Of France's 24 shots,
only seven were on goal.
	   Baggio came closest to scoring a ``golden goal'' _ a
sudden-death winner _ in the 12th minute of the first extra-time
period when he lofted a one-touch volley across the goal and just
wide left. In the game's 119th minute, Pagliuca emerged from the
net to stop Youri Djorkaeff.
	   The game's best scoring chance came two minutes into first-half
injury time when France's Didier Deschamps fed Djorkaeff in the
penalty area. Djorkaeff, with no one but Pagliuca in front of him,
mis-kicked and pulled the shot wide left.
	   What the game lacked in scoring, it made up for in acrobatic
tackles and dives and their accompanying bumps and bruises. The
worst came in the 33rd minute, when Blanc landed with both feet
flush on the body of teammate Emmanuel Petit after both tried to
block a shot from Vieri.
	   Petit lay in agony before he was taken off on a stretcher,
although he returned to the game less than five minutes later.
	   Stephane Guivarc'h provided another ugly highlight when he
rammed his elbow into Fabio Cannavaro's face to earn one of the
game's five yellow cards in the 53rd minute. There were 50 fouls in
the game.
	   France went on the attack from the opening whistle. Zidane shot
across the goalmouth and Petit had a bicycle kick attempt stopped
by Pagliuca, both in the fifth minute.
	   Italy rarely penetrated the French half of the field in the
first 30 minutes. Its only early scoring chance came on a
counterattack in the ninth, when Vieri had to jump over defender
Lilian Thuram to get his head on Francesco Moriero's cross at the
far post. The Italian striker put the ball just wide left.
	   Henry, who has scored three goals in the tournament, was
suffering from an ankle sprain and did not start. He entered as a
substitute in the 65th minute.

Finalists Novotna, Tauziat refuse to act their age
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVEN WINE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Anna Kournikova!
	   OK, now that we have everyone's attention, let's talk about the
women's final Saturday at Wimbledon between Jana Novotna and
Nathalie Tauziat.
	   Alas, Kournikova won't be playing. The brash tennis starlet
finished just six wins shy of the final, withdrawing before the
tournament with a thumb injury that prevented her from thumbing her
nose at opponents.
	   Also absent will be fellow teen queens Martina Hingis, Venus
Williams and Serena Williams. The battle of the ages at Wimbledon
turned out to be a mismatch, with experience prevailing over youth.
	   ``It tells you that the teen-agers are too cocky,'' said
three-time Wimbledon champion John McEnroe, a commentator for
NBC-TV.
	   Novotna, 29, and Tauziat, 30, won't do much to boost network
ratings, but give them credit for refusing to act their age. Many
of their contemporaries have retired, and in combined years they're
the oldest Wimbledon women's finalists since 1977.
	   The Daily Telegraph of London billed Sunday's match as the
Viagra final.
	   ``It really doesn't matter how old you are. Most important is
how you feel,'' Novotna said. ``Nathalie and I are playing very
similar tennis. Our tennis is based on experience, and that's what
we have shown in this championship.''
	   The pairing is surprising given the hype accompanying the
teen-age vanguard, but the youngsters also came up short last month
at the French Open, where Arantxa Sanchez Vicario beat Monica Seles
in the final.
	   This week Hingis lost in the semifinals, then denied that she's
washed up at 17. Venus Williams lost to Novotna in the
quarterfinals but won plaudits for throwing the tournament's best
teen-age temper tantrum. Younger sister Serena Williams, citing a
sore calf, curiously quit a match two games from defeat to save
herself for mixed doubles the following day.
	   With the spotlight on those charismatic kids, Novotna and
Tauziat quietly worked their way through another yet Grand Slam.
It's the 45th for Novotna and the 43rd for Tauziat.
	   Neither has won a major title, and Tauziat had never even
reached a Grand Slam semifinal until this week. Novotna, however,
is a two-time Wimbledon runnerup remembered for sobbing on the
shoulder of the Duchess of Kent after blowing a big lead in the
1993 final.
	   ``She's not the youngest player on the tour anymore,'' Hingis
said. ``Sometimes it seems like the older, the better. If you see
Tauziat on the other side in the finals, it's amazing, you know? I
hope it's going to be like that with me also _ the older, the
smarter, the cleverer, the better.''
	   With maturity, the third-seeded Novotna seems to have overcome a
longstanding reputation for choking. She lost to Hingis in last
year's final but coolly avenged that defeat Thursday, earning a
standing ovation from a crowd well aware of her past suffering on
Centre Court.
	   ``Let's just hope what the Duchess of Kent said last year is
right,'' Novotna said. ``She said, `Third time lucky,' so here I
am.''
	   Tauziat is the first Frenchwoman to reach a Wimbledon final
since Suzanne Lenglen won her sixth title in 1925. Lenglen became
legendary not only because of her talent, but because she wore
short skirts, played without a corset and sipped brandy during
matches.
	   Tauziat, on the other hand, is an obscure 15-year veteran who
had sportscasters scrambling for pronunciation guides (it's
TOE-zee-aah) when she became the lowest-seeded finalist in
Wimbledon history at No. 16.
	   She cracked the top 10 for the first time in January and has won
just four WTA Tour tournaments, two of them on grass. After winning
match point in the semifinal against Natasha Zvereva, Tauziat
shrieked and flopped to the grass in celebration, seemingly as
stunned by her achievement as anyone.
	   ``I don't know what I'm going to do if I win the final,'' she
said. ``I'm not on the moon already, but almost.''
	   Tauziat and Novotna both like to play serve-and-volley, so the
match may hinge on who controls the net. They've played eight times
previously, winning four matches each, but they've yet to meet on
grass.
	   ``I have nothing to lose,'' Tauziat said. ``For me it's going to
be a nice present to be on Centre Court. If I play my best tennis,
I think I can win.''
	   She almost sounded like a brash teen-ager.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The families of two British charity workers taken
hostage a year ago in the breakaway Russian state of Chechnya
appealed to the British government Friday to use all its diplomatic
powers to ensure their release.
	   Relatives of Camilla Carr and Jon James paid a visit to Prime
Minister Tony Blair's 10 Downing St. residence and met with
Baroness Symons, a Foreign Office minister. They also released 52
purple balloons to mark the couple's 52 weeks in captivity.

Kirsten's double century puts South African in command

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Gary Kirsten played the longest
innings in South Africa's cricket history, scoring 210 and giving
his side a grip on the third test against England on Friday.
	   The veteran opener provided the backbone of South Africa's 487
for four at stumps on the second day at Old Trafford.
	   Kirsten opened the innings at 100 GMT Thursday and was finally
out, caught behind trying to cut Angus Fraser, in the 170th over at
1550 GMT. His 525-ball innings lasted 650 minutes, almost 11 hours.
	   Kirsten's 525-ball innings lasted 650 minutes, almost 11 hours.
The late Jackie McGlew held the South African record, taking 575
minutes to score 105 against Australia at Durban in 1957/58.
	   South Africa, already 1-0 up in the five-match series, has its
focus firmly fixed on extending its lead to 2-0 for an unbeatable
position in the series.
	   The 43-test veteran was 98 not out over night and reached his
century with two singles before cutting loose and hitting 10
boundaries either side of lunch to race to 150.
	   His maiden test double century came 78 balls later when he
flicked left arm spinner Ashley Giles through mid-wicket for three
runs.
	   Failing a miracle England bowling comeback, South Africa would
presumably declare at lunch on the third day, leaving the homeside
eight sessions to bat on a pitch expected to favor spin.
	   Kirsten, only the seventh South African to score a double
century, shared a record 238 for the second with Jacques Kallis
(132) and 176 for the third with Daryll Cullinan (75).
	   Cronje and Jonty Rhodes batted out 32 minutes between them to
remain unbeaten on 27 and 12 respectively at stumps.
	   After losing opener Liebenberg (16) in the ninth over of the
innings, South Africa didn't lose another for nearly 24 hours, when
Kallis was finally dismissed on the second morning.
	   An unplayable Darren Gough delivery accounted for Kallis. The
No.3 managed to add just 16 more to his second test century when
Gough knocked his off stump back. Kallis hit 16 boundaries off 266
balls.
	   Kirsten was lucky to escape dismissal twice. He was dropped once
on 87 when Giles missed a caught and bowled chance and once on 24
when he edged a ball just past Nasser Hussain's outstretched hand
at slip.
	   Cullinan was bowled by Giles to give him his first wicket on
debut in the 32nd over.
	   Gough's two wickets cost him 95 runs while Giles and Fraser have
a wicket apiece.

Third Cuban swimmer deserts team, seeks political asylum
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with third swimming deserting. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A third woman swimmer deserted the
Cuban national team Friday and will seek political asylum in the
United States.
	   Liudmila Montes de Oca, an 18-year-old butterfly specialist from
Villa Clara, Cuba, joined two other swimmers who left their team on
Tuesday. The Cuban athletes were among 27 Cuban swimmers training
for this month's Goodwill Games as guests of the Puerto Rico
Swimming Federation.
	   ``I've been thinking about it a long time,'' said Montes de Oca.
She said she left behind a large extended family in Cuba.
	   ``That bothers me, but I know I will get over it,'' she said.
	   Sergio Ramos, a lawyer known for helping Cubans apply for
asylum, said the first two swimmers, Nubis Rosales and Daimara
Munoz, had applied to the Immigration and Naturalization Service
late Thursday for political asylum. An application on behalf of
Montes de Oca would be made Monday, he said.
	   ``We don't expect they will have any problem in obtaining
political asylum,'' said Ramos.
	   On Thursday, the head coach of the Cuban national swimming team,
said he felt betrayed by the desertions.
	   ``For 10 years I've been training them,'' said Jose Vazquez. ``I
trusted them, and now they've left when the team needed them
most.''
	   Because the athletes entered the United States legally, they do
not face the prospect of being jailed while their cases are
reviewed, as illegal immigrants do.
	   Other Cuban athletes have taken advantage of competitions in the
U.S. commonwealth of Puerto Rico to desert their teams.
	   In 1993, 43 Cuban athletes defected during the Central American
and Caribbean Games. the the 1997 Games, Jose Perez left after
winning the bronze medal in the 400-meter hurdles.

Romanian president visits Armenia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Romanian President Emil Constantinescu
said Friday that his country supports a peaceful settlement of the
conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.
	   Constantinescu spoke on his arrival in Armenia for a two-day
visit.
	   Nagorno-Karabakh is a pocket of Azerbaijan that is populated
largely by ethnic Armenians. It declared independence in 1988 and
drove Azerbaijani troops out with Armenian help.
	   Constantinescu said that his visit to countries in the Caucasus
Mountains is mostly devoted to the restoration of the ancient Silk
Road between Europe and Central Asia.
	   For centuries the legendary road facilitated trade and brought
power and prosperity to many cities.
	   Constantinescu called the revival of the route a major project
for the third millennium.

	   HERZOGENAURACH, Germany (AP) _ German sporting goods
manufacturer Adidas-Salomon AG said Friday that it will no longer
award licenses to manufacture soccer balls to outside contractors.
	   Adidas, which supplies soccer balls to the 1998 World Cup in

French edges into semifinal after penalty shootout victory over

	   PARIS (AP) _ Host France squeezed into the semifinal of the
World Cup for the first time since 1986 Friday when it edged Italy
4-3 on penalties after a dull, goalless draw.
	   After 120 minutes of tedious, error-filled play that had few
goal chances, the teams went into a penalty shootout at the Stade
de France and the score was 3-3 before defender Laurent Blanc
stepped up for the French.
	   Blanc, whose extra-time goal against Paraguay put France into
the quarterfinals against the Italians, fired the ball past Italian
keeper Gianluca Pagliuca to give his team the edge.
	   Luigi Di Biagio was next up for Italy and the shaven-headed
midfielder, who has had a standout tournament, hit the bar with his
attempt.
	   As the French players celebrated, Di Biagio was distraught as
his colleagues tried to console him.
	   It was the second time in a row the Italians had lost in the
World Cup on a penalty shootout. The last time was the 1994 final
against Brazil, losing 3-2 in a shootout when Roberto Baggio fired
over the bar. That also was after a 0-0 draw.
	   ``We're walking out of this stadium with our heads up,'' Italy's
coach, Cesare Maldini, said. ``It's a pity because it really is a
lottery when you go to a shootout.''
	   Friday's result meant that France was the first team to reach
the semifinals. Defending champion Brazil met outsider Denmark
later Friday at Nantes.
	   The other two quarterfinals are Saturday, with Argentina facing
the Netherlands at Marseille and Germany meeting debutante Croatia
at Lyon to decide who faces the French.
	   Argentina coach Daniel Passarella is considering changes to his
lineup after the team scrambled into the last eight on the back of
a penalty shootout victory over England.
	   Defender Roberto Sensini is expected to be back anyway after
missing two games due to injury, but Passarella may shakeup his
front line, possibly starting Roma's 30-year-old forward Abel Balbo
as Gabriel Batistuta's partner instead of Claudio Lopez.
	   ``The Netherlands is a great team, with players with tremendous
technical skills,'' Argentina midfielder and team captain Diego
Simeone said Friday. ``We will try to take the midfield from them,
it's there because where they are especially strong.''
	   German coach Berti Vogts is celebrating his 100th game in charge
and his players want to give him the ideal present of a place in
the semifinals.
	   ``I really want to win this game, not because it's my 100th, but
because my team deserves it. They have worked so hard,'' Vogts said
Friday.
	   German captain Juergen Klinsmann hopes the game is not a repeat
of a foul-filled match the two teams played at the European
Championship in 1996.
	   Germany beat Croatia 2-1 in the quarterfinals.
	   ``We know them and we know that it will be a hard job. They have
skilled individuals. And they were very aggressive in Manchester,''
Klinsmann said. ``We have to take charge early and keep the pace
fast. I hope it won't be like in Manchester.
	   ``With all due respect to Croatia, however, it's really up to us
and I am very optimistic. We want to go to Paris (for the semifinal
July 8) and it really depends only on us.''

World Cup: Dutch winger doubtful for quarterfinal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ The Netherlands' speedy left winger
Marc Overmars has injured his hamstring in training and is a
doubtful starter for Saturday's quarterfinal clash with Argentina.
	   ``Yesterday in training we played a match and he suddenly had a
problem,'' coach Guus Hiddink said Friday after his team practiced
at the Stade Velodrome.
	   ``It certainly is a worry because a hamstring injury is not
nothing. The match can last 90 or 120 minutes so I have to take it
into account.''
	   Overmars did not train with the team, but jogged around the
pitch and went through some light stretching drills. He said he was
``cautiously optimistic he would be able to start the game.''
	   He said he had undergone acupuncture therapy on the injury
Friday afternoon.
	   Hiddink refused to name his starting lineup for Saturday's
make-or-break match ``because of the personnel problems.''
	   Inter Milan's Aron Winter also sat out training with an injured
big toe. ``He stubbed it yesterday in training and the joint still
hurts,'' Hiddink said.
	   Right back Michael Reiziger's bruised foot appeared to have
recovered. He trained with the team and Hiddink said he was fit.

Serbs regain control of key Kosovo crossroads

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) - As a top U.S. envoy returned to try
to broker a cease-fire, Serb forces battled Albanian rebels Friday
outside of Kijevo after breaking a two-week siege of the strategic
crossroads town in western Kosovo province.
	   The taking of Kijevo was reported by both Serb and Albanian
sources and confirmed by Western diplomats, hours before scheduled
talks in Belgrade between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic aimed at producing a cease-fire in the
Serbian province.
	   Late Friday, both sides reported fighting continued in the area
around Kijevo, 25 kilometers (15 miles) west of the capital
Pristina, but accounts of casualties were conflicting. Journalists
were not immediately allowed into the area.
	   According to Serb police, after Serb forces broke the siege of
the village, they were trying to continue pushing the KLA as far
west as possible.
	   Murat Musliu, head of an ethnic Albanian human rights group said
after retreating the KLA reinforced their troops in villages around
Kijevo.
	   Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo, since Serb forces
stepped up efforts to crush militant resistance in late February.
Milosevic says the crackdown is aimed at Albanian terrorists who
have targeted Serb police and civilians in their militant campaign
for independence.
	   On the eve of Holbrookes's visit, Milosevic denied any
repressive actions and offered to restore the autonomy he yanked
from the province in 1989 on grounds of protecting the Serb
minority.
	   Holbrooke is pushing for a cease-fire before trying to get
Milosevic to withdraw his forces. But he and other Western
officials are insistent that Kosovo should not be allowed
independence.
	   Holbrooke will travel to Pristina early Saturday to meet with
ethnic Albanians. During his visit to the region last month, he
tried to get the KLA to break the siege of Kijevo, fearing Serb
forces would use massive force against it, sparking a wider war in
the region.
	   Sitting astride the main east-west road in the southern Yugoslav
province, Kijevo has been a flashpoint since the KLA surrounded it
in mid-June and cut off its Serb inhabitants and police. Serb
police had then surrounded the KLA fighters.
	   Serb police sources said they had suffered no injuries in
Friday's action, which they wrapped up about 7:30 a.m., but the
ethnic Albanians had undetermined casualties.
	   Belgrade's independent Beta news agency quoted a Serbian police
source as saying police entered Kijevo Friday morning to find some
100 Serb civilians and about 50 policemen who had been cut off by
the siege.
	   ``There is an ongoing action to search and clear the area around
Kijevo,'' the unidentified police source was quoted as saying,
confirming some fighting still continuing. The source said the
action had been done ``professionally.''
	   An ethnic Albanian human rights group in the region claimed many
were killed and wounded in the dawn attack, in which they said the
Serbs targeted five villages with tanks, helicopters and artillery.
	   But Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
their intelligence reports indicated casualties were not high
because the Kosovo Liberation Army saw the attack coming and
retreated without resisting.
	   Earlier reports by Serb media suggested that retaking the
Serb-populated village and surrounding area was the remaining goal
of the latest crackdown by Milosevic's forces in the secessionist
province. The other was the recapture of the strategic Belacevac
mine region, which they accomplished Tuesday after two days of
nearly non-stop fighting.
	   Underscoring the high tensions throughout Kosovo, a
remote-controlled bomb exploded early Friday in a Serb residential
area of the capital Pristina. No injuries were reported but windows
on nearby buildings and blown out and several cars were damaged in
an attack Serb police blamed on the KLA.

	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Pete Sampras outplayed Tim Henman in
four sets Friday to move within one victory of his fifth Wimbledon
title in six years.
	   Sampras lost his first set of the tournament but relied on his
superior serve and experience to prevail 6-3, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3,
stopping Henman's bid to become the first British men's finalist in
62 years.
	   Sampras will play two-time runnerup Goran Ivanisevic in Sunday's
final.

Serbs regain control of key Kosovo crossroads

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A U.S. envoy returned to try to
broker a cease-fire, and Serb forces battled ethnic Albanian rebels
Friday outside of Kijevo after breaking a two-week siege of the
strategic crossroads town in the province of Kosovo.
	   The taking of Kijevo was reported by both Serb and ethnic
Albanian sources and confirmed by Western diplomats, hours before
talks on a cease-fire were to start in Belgrade between U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Late Friday, both sides reported fighting continued in the area
around Kijevo, 25 kilometers (15 miles) west of the capital,
Pristina, but accounts of casualties were conflicting. Journalists
were not immediately allowed into the area.
	   According to Serb police, after Serb forces broke the siege of
the village, they were trying to continue pushing the ethnic
Albanian fighters as far west as possible.
	   Murat Musliu, head of an ethnic Albanian human rights group,
said the rebels reinforced their troops in villages around Kijevo
after retreating.
	   Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo since Serb forces stepped
up efforts to crush militant resistance in late February. Milosevic
says the crackdown is aimed at ethnic Albanian terrorists who have
targeted Serb police and civilians in their militant campaign for
independence. About 90 percent of Kosovo's population is ethnic
Albanian, but the Serbs regard the province as the cradle of their
culture.
	   On the eve of Holbrooke's visit, Milosevic offered to restore
the autonomy he yanked from the province in 1989, saying then that
he was protecting the Serb minority.
	   Holbrooke is pushing for a cease-fire before trying to get
Milosevic to withdraw his forces. But he and other Western
officials are insistent that Kosovo should not be allowed
independence.
	   Holbrooke was to travel to Pristina on Saturday to meet with
ethnic Albanians. During his visit to the region last month, he
tried to get the Kosovo Liberation Army to break the siege of
Kijevo, fearing that Serb forces would use massive force against
it, sparking a wider war in the region.
	   Sitting astride the main east-west road in the southern Yugoslav
province, Kijevo has been a flashpoint since the KLA surrounded it
in mid-June and cut off its Serb inhabitants and police. Serb
police then surrounded the KLA fighters.
	   Serb police sources said they had suffered no injuries in
Friday's action, but that the ethnic Albanians had undetermined
casualties.
	   Belgrade's independent Beta news agency quoted a Serbian police
source as saying that police entered Kijevo Friday morning to find
about 100 Serb civilians and about 50 policemen who had been cut
off by the siege.
	   ``There is an ongoing action to search and clear the area around
Kijevo,'' the unidentified police source was quoted as saying,
confirming that some fighting continued. The source said the action
had been performed ``professionally.''
	   An ethnic Albanian human rights group in the region claimed that
many were killed and wounded in the dawn attack, in which they said
the Serbs targeted five villages with tanks, helicopters and
artillery.
	   But Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
their intelligence reports indicated that casualties were not high
because the KLA saw the attack coming and retreated without
resisting.
	   Earlier reports by Serb media suggested that retaking the
Serb-populated village and surrounding area was the remaining goal
of the latest crackdown by Milosevic's forces in the secessionist
province. The other was the recapture of the strategic Belacevac
mine region, which they accomplished Tuesday after two days of
nearly non-stop fighting.
	   Underscoring the high tensions throughout Kosovo, a
remote-controlled bomb exploded early Friday in a Serb residential
area of Pristina. No injuries were reported but windows on nearby
buildings were blown out and several cars were damaged in an attack
Serb police blamed on the KLA.

WIMBLEDON: Sunday's final.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Ivanisevic squandered two match points in the fourth set, then
outlasted Richard Krajicek 15-13 in a marathon fifth set.
	   It will be a repeat of the 1994 final, which Sampras won in
straight sets.
	   Sampras had to come up with some of his best tennis against the
12th-seeded Henman, his occasional practice and doubles partner.
	   ``There was a lot of emotion out there, especially playing Tim
here in England,'' Sampras said. ``This is what it's all about. You
raise your level of intensity and raise your emotions.''
	   By winning Sunday, Sampras would join Bjorn Borg as the only
players in the Open era to win Wimbledon five times. A victory
would also give him a total of 11 Grand Slam titles, one behind
all-time leader Roy Emerson.
	   Returning to the final ended a slump for Sampras, who had failed
to get past the quarters of a a Grand Slam tournament since last
year's Wimbledon.
	   Henman, the first British men's semifinalist in 25 years, had
been aiming to become the first homegrown finalist since Henry
Austin in 1938 and first champion since Fred Perry in 1936.

Montserrat volcano breaks silence, erupts, but does no new damage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OLD TOWNE, Montserrat (AP) _ After months of silence, the
Soufriere Hills volcano erupted again Friday, sending super-hot
clouds of gas, ash and rocks plunging to the sea but doing no new
damage.
	   ``This is the biggest eruption since December 1997 and has come
after three months of quiet activity by the volcano,'' said Gill
Norton, deputy chief scientist at the Montserrat Volcano
Observatory on the Caribbean island of Montserrat.
	   The dome collapse spewed ash to 45,000 feet (13,700 meters) and
sent a pyroclastic flow _ a rapid-moving, 1,000 F (550 C) rush of
gas, ash and rocks _ charging down the eastern flank of the
mountain to the sea.
	   Most of the island has long been evacuated since the volcano
became active in 1995 and no new damage was done. The remaining
residents of the 39-square-mile (101-square-kilometer) island now
live on the northern side.
	   ``The north of the island got a light sprinkling of ash which
has now thankfully been washed away by heavy rains,'' Norton said.
	   Eruptions are normally preceded by earthquake activity or
smaller pyroclastic flows, but this one occurred with no advance
warning, Norton said.
	   Prior to Friday's eruption, the volcano had been almost
completely quiet since early March.

Lebanon arrests 11 former Christian militiamen for bombings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese security forces have arrested 11
former members of a right-wing Christian militia suspected of
involvement in a series of bombings aimed at destabilizing the
country.
	   A statement issued by security sources and carried by the
official media said the men were behind a 1996 attack against a
Syrian bus that killed its driver and an explosion at the main bus
terminal in downtown Beirut in October 1997 that caused no
casualties.
	   It said the men may also have been behind an attack that
targeted the U.S. Embassy, but left no casualties.
	   The statement did not say when the 11 were arrested.
	   It said, however, that two members of the group were killed in
Beirut on June 12 when a bomb that they were transporting exploded
prematurely.
	   The statement said that an investigation by the Lebanese army's
Intelligence Department revealed that among the 11 men were four
members of a ``shock troop'' cell of the former Lebanese Forces
militia that received orders via the internet from a militia office
in Australia.
	   A member of the Lebanese Forces political council in Australia
denied any involvement.
	   ``We have had nothing to do with this matter or any other
matters,'' Tony Chidiac told the Australian Associated Press in
Sydney.
	   The Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia during the
1975-90 civil war, was disbanded by the Syrian-backed government in
1994 and its leaders jailed.
	   During the war, the militia opposed Syrian influence and had
close ties to Israel. Syria maintains some 30,000 soldiers in
Lebanon and is the main power broker in the country.
	   The statement also said the group had planned to assassinate
three unnamed political and security officials.
	   However, the state-run National News Agency said Friday evening
that Interior Minister Michel Murr and Minister of Electricity and
Hydraulic Resources Elias Hobeika were among those targeted by the
group.
	   The group had planned to kill Murr in a car bomb and Hobeika by
a sniper's fire, the agency said, quoting unnamed officials
investigating the case.
	   Defense Minister Mohsen Dalloul said the group was ``entirely
linked'' to Israel. ``The group's mission was to undermine security
and stability in the country,'' he said.
	   Last month, several members of the Lebanese Forces won seats in
municipal elections in Christian areas. It was their first
political participation after boycotting elections since the end of
the civil war.

Clinton says he more for human rights by engaging leaders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Clinton-China &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton defended his
avoiding of political dissidents during his trip to China, saying
he believed he did more to advance their cause by pressing China's
communist leaders directly.
	   ``The United States is on your side and we did our best,''
Clinton said Friday when asked at a departing news conference
whether he had a message for the dissidents.
	   Clinton said he hoped his visit would prompt leaders to release
imprisoned dissidents, including some still in jail for their role
in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.
	   ``I felt that by going directly to engage the Chinese, starting
with the president, and especially taking advantage of the
opportunity to have this free and open debate before all the
Chinese people, I could do more in the short and in the long run to
advance the cause of human rights,'' Clinton said.
	   He did meet earlier Friday with Martin Lee and several other
pro-democracy lawmakers among the 20 legislators who won recent
elections in Hong Kong.
	   Lee told reporters Clinton's trip had been successful in
bringing a new openness in China. But he said he wanted to see more
solid steps toward reform both in Hong Kong and on the mainland.
	   ``The door in China has been opened a bit,'' Lee said. ``We in
Hong Kong want to see the door open wider. ... We hope to see
concrete results of Mr. Clinton's visit _ a faster pace of reform
in terms of human rights, the rule of law and democracy.''
	   Clinton's decision not to meet with dissidents or pro-democracy
activists other than those who are elected officials, particularly
when he was in Beijing, drew condemnation from congressional
critics and human rights activists in the United States.
	   ``I have continued to raise individual cases, and will continue
to do so with the Chinese government and with the president,''
Clinton said.
	   ``We believe that this strategy is the one most likely to
advance the cause of free speech and free association and free
expression of religious conviction as well.''
	   Clinton and Lee, who last met in April 1997 in Washington,
talked for about 20 minutes. After that session, Clinton met with
some of Hong Kong's elected leaders, who said he spent most of the
time simply listening to them.
	   The group included pro-democracy politicians recently voted into
the legislature in the first elections since the territory returned
to Chinese rule a year ago. Only a third of the legislature was
elected by direct popular vote.
	   Those meeting with Clinton included both critics and backers of
Beijing who won election by popular vote in the May 24 election.
	   Lee and other Democrats say Hong Kong's 6.5 million people have
retained most of their freedoms since China regained sovereignty.
However, the powerful Hong Kong economy has been dragged into
recession by Asia's economic troubles.
	   Lee said he told Clinton, ``If Hong Kong can keep basic values
of freedom and democracy, it would be a tremendous help to (the)
entire region.''
	   Tsang Yok-sing, chairman of the pro-China Democratic Alliance
for the Betterment of Hong Kong, called the meeting ``a clear
breakthrough,'' and said it had ``good implications for Hong
Kong.''
	   Clinton said he hoped China would reassess its position of some
of those still in jail.
	   ``Let me just mention, for example, there probably are 150
people who are still incarcerated as a result of the events in
Tiananmen Square who were convicted of nonviolent offenses,'' he
said.

World Cup: France wins shootout to advance to semis

	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Again Italy couldn't hit that vital
penalty. Again defender Laurent Blanc came through for France.
	   Blanc scoring the decider in another gut-wrenching penalty
shootout that sent the French into the semifinals of the World Cup
for the first time since 1986.
	   After a 120-minute thriller with everything but goals, it came
down to penalties to divide the two neighboring soccer giants.
Luigi Di Biagio crashed Italy's fifth shot onto the bar, releasing
the crowd of 80,000 at the Stade de France into wild celebrations.
	   ``I'm totally exhausted,'' French coach Aime Jacquet said. ``The
better team won. ... It was 50-50 up in the air.''
	   The game marked the third consecutive time that Italy has been
eliminated from the World Cup in a penalty shootout. Argentina
knocked out Italy in Naples in the 1990 tournament, and Roberto
Baggio sailed an attempt over the bar in the 1994 final to give
Brazil the title.
	   ``It's a sort of a curse,'' Italian coach Cesare Maldini said.
`` We're walking out of this stadium with our heads up. It's a pity
because it really is a lottery when you go to a shootout. I have no
regrets.''
	   Zinedine Zidane, David Trezeguet, Thierry Henry and Laurent
Blanc made the spot kicks for France. Baggio, Alessandro Costacurta
and Christian Vieri converted for Italy.
	   France's Bixente Lizarazu and Italy's Demitrio Albertini both
missed in the shootout's second round, and the teams stayed
neck-and-neck until Blanc nailed his and Di Biagio sent Italy home.
	   Blanc also scored France's ``Golden Goal'' in sudden-death
extra-time in a 1-0 second-round victory over Paraguay on Sunday.
	   France will come back to the Stade de France on Wednesday to
play the winner of Saturday's Germany-Croatia match.
	   The shootout, the second of France 98, came after 120 minutes of
rough-and-tumble play dominated statistically by the French, who
took 13 corner kicks to Italy's two and outshot the Italians by
31-10. Italy didn't get its first corner kick until the third
minute of the second-half injury time.
	   Italy almost snatched the game in the 102nd minute, when Baggio
ran onto a long pass from Angelo Di Livio and volleyed the ball
without controlling it. It was a piece of magic from the veteran,
but it swerved just past the far post.
	   Even later, in the 118th minute, Henry put Youri Djorkaeff
through, but the French forward could not lift the ball over his
Inter Milan teammate, goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca.
	   So it came down to penalties and the heart-stopping moments.
	   Even French President Jacques Chirac was held in a spell. ``He
was here to show all of France was behind us,'' said Jacquet.
	   Throughout the match, Zidane spread play around at ease and
swept past his personal marker Gianluca Pessotto with almost royal
disdain.
	   The lack of a true goalscorer among Les Bleus was sorely felt,
though.
	   After a first half of near constant pressure, France's best
chance came in injury time when Djorkaeff set up a one-two with
Didier Deschamps through the center and came eye-to-eye with
Pagliuca. However, the French forward miscued his shot and it went
wide.
	   Italy could live with the pressure as long as it could break. In
the ninth minute, Moriero shook off his marker Lizarazu and crossed
into the goalmouth where Vieri headed just wide.
	   In the 33rd minute, Vieri launched a rising drive at goalkeeper
Fabien Barthez and it took a good punching save to deflect the
ball. Two minutes later, Barthez had to throw his whole body at
Vieri to deny him on a drive.
	   Vieri was controlled by France's smothering defense from then
on. In five World Cup matches, France has only allowed just one
penalty goal.
	   Alessandro Del Piero, who was touted as one of the potential
World Cup stars, was near invisible apart from earning a yellow
card. Maldini, who benched Baggio for Del Piero refused to condemn
the Juventus forward. ``He did his work,'' said Maldini.
	   Jacquet sprang a major surprise ahead of the game, including
Real Madrid midfielder Christian Karembeu in a reinforced midfield.
Henry, who slotted three goals so far, was sidelined after
suffering an ankle sprain in Sunday's win over Paraguay.
	   Maldini included tough defender Pessotto in his lineup instead
of the more offensive minded Albertini.
	   Seven of France's starting lineup are playing in Italy or have
played there in the past few years, including Zidane, making a
comeback after missing two games because of suspension.
	   Although players on both sides were friends, the game was rough,
with 50 fouls called and five yellow cards issued

Queen Elizabeth II ``not amused'' by England soccer team's
</HEADLINE>
disallowed goal

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ Along with most of her nation, Queen
Elizabeth II took exception to England's disallowed goal during the
country's thrilling World Cup soccer match against Argentina on
Tuesday.
	   ``We are not amused,'' the queen said, in a parody of the famous
quote by her ancestor, Queen Victoria, according to a witness who
was with her when defender Sol Campbell's header was disallowed 11
minutes from the end of the match. The teams finished the game at
2-2.
	   ``She was excited at the standard of football on display, but
she was disappointed when the goal was disallowed,'' said Eric
Milligan, mayor of Edinburgh. ``She said `one is not amused', in a
parody.''
	   On the night of the game, the queen had hosted a dinner party at
her Edinburgh residence, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, timed to end
so that the royal party, including about 10 palace officials and
the Duke of Edinburgh, could watch the match, said David Anderson,
superintendent of the palace.
	   Anderson said that after extra time, the queen retired to her
private apartments in the palace to watch the penalty shoot-out
which England lost 3-4. Her reaction to the final score was not
known, Anderson said.

French edges into semifinal after penalty shootout victory over
</HEADLINE>
Italy &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDs more quotes, that Italians eliminated three times in a
row in shootouts, WILL BE UPDATED after Brazil-Denmark &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Host France squeezed into the semifinal of the
World Cup for the first time since 1986 Friday when it edged Italy
4-3 on penalties after a dull, goalless draw.
	   After 120 minutes of tedious, error-filled play that had few
goal chances, the teams went into a penalty shootout at the Stade
de France and the score was 3-3 before defender Laurent Blanc
stepped up for the French.
	   Blanc, whose extra-time goal against Paraguay put France into
the quarterfinals against the Italians, fired the ball past Italian
keeper Gianluca Pagliuca to give his team the edge.
	   Luigi Di Biagio was next up for Italy and the shaven-headed
midfielder, who has had a standout tournament, hit the bar with his
attempt.
	   As the French players celebrated, Di Biagio was distraught as
his colleagues tried to console him.
	   It was the third time in a row the Italians had lost in the
World Cup on a penalty shootout. The last time was the 1994 final
against Brazil, losing 3-2 in a shootout when Roberto Baggio fired
over the bar. That also was after a 0-0 draw.
	   In 1990 Argentina edged the Italians 4-3 on penalties in the
semifinal after a 1-1 tie.
	   ``It's a sort of a curse,'' Italy's coach, Cesare Maldini, said.
	   ``We're walking out of this stadium with our heads up. It's a
pity because it really is a lottery when you go to a shootout.
	   ``I can't fault any of my players, they gave it all,'' the
Italian coach said. ``The team played really well.''
	   Despite the fact that his team has scraped through its last two
games with narrow victories, French coach Aime Jacquet believes it
is capable of winning the World Cup.
	   ``We have the players and the spirit now to go all the way and
take the title,'' he said.
	   ``It was a very difficult match. But we managed to stick to our
game plan and France really deserved to win. We kept our nerve in
the penalty shoot-out.''
	   Friday's result meant that France was the first team to reach
the semifinals. Defending champion Brazil met outsider Denmark
later Friday at Nantes.
	   The other two quarterfinals are Saturday, with Argentina facing
the Netherlands at Marseille and Germany meeting debutante Croatia
at Lyon to decide who faces the French.
	   Argentina coach Daniel Passarella is considering changes to his
lineup after the team scrambled into the last eight on the back of
a penalty shootout victory over England.
	   Defender Roberto Sensini is expected to be back anyway after
missing two games due to injury, but Passarella may shakeup his
front line, possibly starting Roma's 30-year-old forward Abel Balbo
as Gabriel Batistuta's partner instead of Claudio Lopez.
	   ``The Netherlands is a great team, with players with tremendous
technical skills,'' Argentina midfielder and team captain Diego
Simeone said Friday. ``We will try to take the midfield from them,
it's there because where they are especially strong.''
	   German coach Berti Vogts is celebrating his 100th game in charge
and his players want to give him the ideal present of a place in
the semifinals.
	   ``I really want to win this game, not because it's my 100th, but
because my team deserves it. They have worked so hard,'' Vogts said
Friday.
	   German captain Juergen Klinsmann hopes the game is not a repeat
of a foul-filled match the two teams played at the European
Championship in 1996.
	   Germany beat Croatia 2-1 in the quarterfinals.
	   ``We know them and we know that it will be a hard job. They have
skilled individuals. And they were very aggressive in Manchester,''
Klinsmann said. ``We have to take charge early and keep the pace
fast. I hope it won't be like in Manchester.
	   ``With all due respect to Croatia, however, it's really up to us
and I am very optimistic. We want to go to Paris (for the semifinal
July 8) and it really depends only on us.''

	   ``One day, he's going to win this thing,'' Sampras said. ``I can
tell you that. He's very, very strong. He does everything very
well. He doesn't have any holes in his game. He's going to learn
from this match.''
	   Henman offered no excuses.
	   ``At 5-6 in the third set, he was the one that came up with the
goods,'' he said. ``It's relentless the way he plays.''
	   Sampras broke Henman twice to take the first set. But Henman
displayed the full range of his grass-court talents in the second
set, breaking Sampras twice. It was the first set Sampras had lost
in six matches.
	   Henman stayed even with Sampras in the third set until the
American broke in the 12th game. After Henman saved two set points,
Sampras converted on the third, ripping a backhand return which
forced a volley error. He skipped to the back of the court and
pumped his right fist.
	   ``When I won the third set, I knew I had him,'' Sampras said.
	   Sampras broke for 3-1 in the fourth set, attacking Henman's
second serve, punching a forehand volley winner and celebrating
with more fist pumping.
	   Sampras served out the match in the ninth game, closing with his
16th ace.
	   Throughout the match, Sampras came up with big serves when he
needed them. He hit the fastest serve of the tournament so far, a
delivery timed at 136 mph (219 kph).
	   Ivanisevic put on an animated display after winning 6-3, 6-4,
5-7, 6-7 (7-5), 15-13 in a match that lasted 3 hours, 22 minutes,
with the final set alone going 1:19.
	   He fell to his knees, tapped the grass with his hand and held
his clenched fists in the air when Krajicek _ the 1996 champion _
netted a backhand volley to end the match in the 28th game of the
final set. He then flung his racket across the court high into the
stands.
	   The Croatian ripped off his bandana, tossed two towels into the
stands, clapped to the crowd and held up his left index finger in a
No. 1 salute as he walked off the Centre Court.
	   ``The fifth set was a just a horror-thriller,'' he said. ``I
never saw somebody serving like that in my life. They were just
bombs. I couldn't even react. I said, `Just keep your serve. He has
to miss a couple of first serves.' And that happened at 13-14.''
	   Ivanisevic reached the final for the third time, having lost in
the 1992 and 1994 championship matches. He has never won a Grand
Slam title and came into this tournament after winning only one
match in his five previous Slam events.
	   The women's final is set for Saturday, with Jana Novotna facing
Nathalie Tauziat.
	   Playing in his 11th Wimbledon, Ivanisevic came in with few
expectations and was overlooked as a serious contender. Ranked No.
25, he was only seeded because of his past record at Wimbledon.
	   ``This means a lot,'' he said. ``A lot of people said, `He's
gone. He's never going to be back.' But I worked hard the last six
months and Wimbledon came at the right time.''
	   Ivanisevic said he was having fun playing tennis again and was
determined to rid himself of the tag ``best player never to have
won a major.''
	   ``I think it's time to change on Sunday,'' he said.
	   The most surprising aspect of Ivanisevic's victory was how he
didn't lose his temper, his concentratation or his composure after
missing the two match points in the fourth set and going down a
break in the fifth.
	   ``I don't think anybody bet on me when I lost the fourth set,''
he said. ``People thought, `he's gone, he's going to lose it.' ...
I was just mentally very strong today. Never like this in my life.
I just believed I was going to win it.''
	   The two wasted match points came with Ivanisevic serving at 5-4,
40-15 in the fourth set.
	   Both players thought the match was over when he hit a big first
serve which appeared, at first glance, to be an ace. But it was
ruled a let by the umpire.
	   Krajicek had started walking towards the net to congratulate
Ivanisevic. When he heard the let ruling, he smiled and held out
his hand in gest. Ivanisevic looked playfully up at the sky and
smiled.
	   When the serve was replayed, Krajicek saved the match point with
a backhand cross-court volley.
	   It was now 40-30, and Ivanisevic had a second chance to end the
match. He double faulted.
	   Krajicek followed with two of his best shots of the match _ a
cross-court backhand pass and a running forehand pass _ to break
for 5-5.
	   After the two held in their next service games, Krajicek won the
tiebreaker to send the match into the decisive fifth set.
	   Even after Krajicek went up a break at 3-2, Ivanisevic did not
panic. He responded by breaking back in the next game.
	   The match then continued on serve, with each player slamming
aces and winners and holding easily.
	   Eventually, Krajicek appeared to run out of steam and Ivanisevic
finally broke through in the 28th game.
	   A backhand chip down the line gave Ivanisevic two match points
at 15-40. Krajicek missed his first serve, and Ivanisevic ripped
back the second, with the Dutchman dumping his volley into the net.
	   Krajicek finished with 42 aces, including 23 in the fifth set.
Ivanisevic had 28 aces and 16 double faults.

Bank shareholders to sue New York state and city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A group of Credit Suisse bank
shareholders will sue New York City and New York state over their
plans to stop investing in Swiss banks, a spokesman for the group
said Friday.
	   ``They are blackmailing the Swiss banks, thereby harming the
institutions' reputation and, in turn, damaging our shareholder
value,'' said Marc Fessler, a Credit Suisse shareholder.
	   New York City and state turned up the pressure on Swiss banks
late Thursday. The city and state said they would stop investing in
Swiss banks until they return the assets of Holocaust victims.
	   Three Swiss banks made what they said was their final offer of
dlrs 600 million last month. But Jewish leaders claimed that was
far less than the more than dlrs 1 billion the banks should be
paying.
	   Christoph Meier, spokesman for the United Bank of Switzerland,
said Friday the banks' offer is still on the table, but he and
other bank spokesmen declined to comment on the shareholders'
announcement.
	   Fessler, also managing director of the Swiss asset management
company SwiPex AG, plans to launch the class-action lawsuit on the
very first day of the boycott, which authorities in New York say
will be September 1.
	   ``We'll only withdraw if our opponents return to the negotiation
table with the banks, or if they drop their plans altogether,''
Fessler said.
	   The class-action suit will be filed in cooperation with a
lawyer's office in the Swiss capital Bern and lawyers in New York,
according to Fessler.
	   While he couldn't specify the amount of damages the group will
seek to recoup in U.S. courts, Fessler said ``the sum will be just
as striking as everything we've so far heard from overseas.''
	   One of the Swiss lawyers said under condition of anonymity that
the sum might be at least dlrs 1 billion. But this lawyer also said
the suit is only being prepared. Many financial questions have to
be addressed first, he said.
	   Despite U.S. government objections, a commission advising
hundreds of city and state finance officials Wednesday opened the
way for sanctions after declaring negotiations between the banks
and Holocaust survivors at an impasse.
	   The commission is chaired by New York City Comptroller Alan
Hevesi, who has been spearheading the sanctions threats.
	   Other states have announced plans for sanctions, but Fessler
said for the moment the shareholder group is focusing only on New
York.
	   New York City and state, which have hundreds of millions of
dollars in pension funds invested in Swiss banks and other
companies, said if there is no settlement by Sept. 1, they will bar
short-term investments with the banks.
	   The banks and Swiss investment firms will also be forbidden from
selling state and city debt, said Hevesi. If the impasse continues,
he said, the bans will be extended to additional Swiss financial
services in November and to all Swiss companies in January.

Becker is back at Wimbledon _ in broadcast booth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Boris Becker is back at Wimbledon.
	   Not on the court, of course. He quit playing Grand Slams last
year after losing to Pete Sampras in the Wimbledon quarterfinals.
	   But he's at the All England Club covering the matches for
British television and made a rare appearance Friday on the
American network NBC with commentator and fellow three-time
Wimbledon champion John McEnroe.
	   ``The Albert Einstein of the Wimbledon grass-court _ Centre
Court,'' McEnroe called Becker, who reached seven Wimbledon finals.
``Sampras has taken the mantle from Boris since his domination.''
	   Boris, any temptation to play Wimbledon again?
	   ``The weeks before the tournament, I started to get itchy,''
Becker said from the broadcast booth overlooking Centre Court.
``It's a completely new perspective, a new vision for me. It's a
beautiful view here.''
	   ``It's very tempting now seeing them playing on Centre Court,''
added the 30-year-old Becker, who manages Germany's Davis Cup team.
``More than half of my life I was part of the tournament as a
player, but life goes on.''
	   ``It's the mental approach, knowing when the time has come and
you can no longer compete for Grand Slams and the No. 1 ranking in
the world,'' Becker added. ``Really, the last two or three years of
my career I realized Pete was better.''
	   Becker had a word of caution to American men's tennis, which
seems to have no one in the pipeline to replace Sampras.
	   ``I don't see any young players from America coming, and once
America was the greatest tennis playing nation in the world,''
Becker said. ``They have to be careful not to lose that.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PETE'S RECORD: &LR;  Tim Henman couldn't do it, losing in four sets
Friday to Sampras in the semifinals. Sampras has only lost five
times at Wimbledon: Todd Woodbridge, 1989; Christo Van Rensburg,
1990; Derrick Rostagno, 1991; Goran Ivanisevic, 1992; Richard
Krajicek, 1996.
	   This is Sampras' 37th career Grand Slam. The Henman match was
his 173rd. He's 147-26 in Grand Slams and only five players have
won more: Jimmy Connors 233, Ivan Lendl 222, Stefan Edberg 178,
McEnroe 167, Becker 160.
	   However, Sampras' winning percentage is better than all of them
at 85.0 percent followed by Connors (82.6), Lendl (81.9), McEnroe
(81.5), Becker (80.4), Edberg (79.1).
	   In winning four times at Wimbledon, he's 44-5 _ 89.8 percent _
far better than either of the other five. Only five-time Wimbledon
champion Bjorn Borg has a better winning percentage at Wimbledon _
51-4 (92.7 percent).
	   ___
	   ATTENDANCE OFF: Crowds are off at Wimbledon. Going into play
Friday, attendance was down 14,794 from last year. This despite
last year being the wettest Wimbledon in history with two days
rained out. The explanation? The lack of compelling matches and
Wimbledon going head-to-head with the month-long World Cup in
France.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   60 YEARS AGO: &LR;  Bunny Austin, the last British man to reach the
Wimbledon finals _ losing in 1938 to American Don Budge _ received
five pounds (dlrs 8) for that performance. He said he spent it on a
gold pen for his wife, who promptly lost it.
	   Austin, a month from his 92nd birthday, lost 6-1, 6-0, 6-3 to
Budge in that final.
	   ``I wasn't very good,'' Austin said, speaking from the nursing
home where he lives in southern England. ``I couldn't serve and my
overhands were poor. Of course, I worked on the stock exchange in
the morning and played matches in the afternoon.''
	   On watching the Henman match: ``It doesn't cheer me up, it tires
me out,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WOODIES AGAIN: &LR;  The Australian doubles team of Todd Woodbridge
and Mark Woodforde reached the final Friday as they try to become
the first in history to win the title six straight times. Reggie
and Laurie Doherty won five straight from 1897-1901 and won eight
overall, also winning three between 1903-05.
	   The Woodies _ second seeded _ beat Jonas Bjorkman and Patrick
Rafter 6-4, 1-6, 6-2, 7-5. They will face top seeds Jacco Eltingh
and Paul Haarhuuis of the Netherlands in the final.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MARATHON: &LR;  The last set of Goran Ivanisevic's semifinal win over
Friday Richard Krajicek _ 15-13 _ was a long one but nowhere near
the longest at Wimbledon. Twice 46 games have been played in a set,
but both came in the 1960s before the tiebreaker was instituted.

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Pete Sampras outplayed Tim Henman in
four sets Friday to move within one victory of his fifth Wimbledon
title in six years.
	   Sampras, who lost his first set of the tournament, relied on his
superior serve and experience to prevail 6-3, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3. He
ended Henman's bid to become the first British men's finalist in 60
years.
	   Sampras had to come up with some of his best tennis against the
12th-seeded Henman, his occasional practice and doubles partner.
	   ``There was a lot of emotion out there, especially playing Tim
here in England,'' Sampras said. ``This is what it's all about. You
raise your level of intensity and raise your emotions.''
	   Sampras will play two-time runnerup Goran Ivanisevic in Sunday's
final. It will be a repeat of the 1994 final, which Sampras won in
straight sets.
	   Ivanisevic squandered two match points in the fourth set, then
outlasted Richard Krajicek in a marathon fifth set to win 6-3, 6-4,
5-7, 6-7 (7-5), 15-13. The match lasted 3 hours, 22 minutes, with
the final set alone going 1:19.
	   The women's final is set for Saturday, with Jana Novotna facing
Nathalie Tauziat.
	   By winning Sunday, Sampras would join Bjorn Borg as the only
players in the Open era to win Wimbledon five times. A victory
would also give him a total of 11 Grand Slam titles, one behind
all-time leader Roy Emerson.
	   Returning to the final ended a slump for Sampras, who had failed
to get past the quarters of a a Grand Slam tournament since last
year's Wimbledon.
	   Henman, the first British men's semifinalist in 25 years, had
been aiming to become the first homegrown finalist since Henry
Austin in 1938 and first champion since Fred Perry in 1936.
	   ``One day, he's going to win this thing,'' Sampras said. ``I can
tell you that. He's very, very strong. He does everything very
well. He doesn't have any holes in his game. He's going to learn
from this match.''
	   Henman offered no excuses.
	   ``At 5-6 in the third set, he was the one that came up with the
goods,'' he said. ``It's relentless the way he plays.''
	   Sampras broke Henman twice to take the first set. But Henman
displayed the full range of his grass-court talents in the second
set, breaking Sampras twice. It was the first set Sampras had lost
in six matches.
	   Henman stayed even with Sampras in the third set until the
American broke in the 12th game. After Henman saved two set points,
Sampras converted on the third, ripping a backhand return which
forced a volley error. He skipped to the back of the court and
pumped his right fist.
	   ``When I won the third set, I knew I had him,'' Sampras said.
	   Sampras broke for 3-1 in the fourth set, attacking Henman's
second serve, punching a forehand volley winner and celebrating
with more fist pumping.
	   Sampras served out the match in the ninth game, closing with his
16th ace.
	   Throughout the match, Sampras came up with big serves when he
needed them. He hit the fastest serve of the tournament so far, a
delivery timed at 136 mph (219 kph).
	   Ivanisevic put on an animated display after Krajicek _ the 1996
champion _ netted a backhand volley to end the match in the 28th
game of the final set.
	   He fell to his knees, tapped the grass with his hand and held
his clenched fists in the air. He then flung his racket across the
court high into the stands.
	   The Croatian ripped off his bandana, tossed two towels into the
stands, clapped to the crowd and held up his left index finger in a
No. 1 salute as he walked off the Centre Court.
	   ``The fifth set was a just a horror-thriller,'' he said. ``I
never saw somebody serving like that in my life. They were just
bombs. I couldn't even react. I said, `Just keep your serve. He has
to miss a couple of first serves.' And that happened at 13-14.''
	   Ivanisevic reached the final for the third time, having lost in
the 1992 and 1994 championship matches. He has never won a Grand
Slam title and came into this tournament after winning only one
match in his five previous Slam events.
	   Playing in his 11th Wimbledon, Ivanisevic came in with few
expectations and was overlooked as a serious contender. Ranked No.
25, he was only seeded because of his past record at Wimbledon.
	   ``This means a lot,'' he said. ``A lot of people said, `He's
gone. He's never going to be back.' But I worked hard the last six
months and Wimbledon came at the right time.''
	   Ivanisevic said he was having fun playing tennis again and was
determined to rid himself of the tag ``best player never to have
won a major.''
	   ``I think it's time to change on Sunday,'' he said.
	   The most surprising aspect of Ivanisevic's victory was how he
didn't lose his temper, his concentratation or his composure after
missing the two match points in the fourth set and going down a
break in the fifth.
	   ``I don't think anybody bet on me when I lost the fourth set,''
he said. ``People thought, `he's gone, he's going to lose it.' ...
I was just mentally very strong today. Never like this in my life.
I just believed I was going to win it.''
	   The two wasted match points came with Ivanisevic serving at 5-4,
40-15 in the fourth set.
	   Both players thought the match was over when he hit a big first
serve which appeared, at first glance, to be an ace. But it was
ruled a let by the umpire.
	   Krajicek had started walking towards the net to congratulate
Ivanisevic. When he heard the let ruling, he smiled and held out
his hand in gest. Ivanisevic looked playfully up at the sky and
smiled.
	   When the serve was replayed, Krajicek saved the match point with
a backhand cross-court volley.
	   It was now 40-30, and Ivanisevic had a second chance to end the
match. He double faulted.
	   Krajicek followed with two of his best shots of the match _ a
cross-court backhand pass and a running forehand pass _ to break
for 5-5.
	   After the two held in their next service games, Krajicek won the
tiebreaker to send the match into the decisive fifth set.
	   Krajicek finished with 42 aces, including 23 in the fifth set.
Ivanisevic had 28 aces and 16 double faults.

German coalition split over conservative's foreigner's suggestion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition was
split Friday over a suggestion by a conservative Bavarian
politician to set up separate facilities to process desired and
undesired foreigners entering the country.
	   The deputy General Secretary of Bavaria's ultra-conservative
Christian Social Union, Joachim Herrmann, has suggested that
skilled people coming to work in Germany should not have to stand
in line to be processed with undesired or criminal types seeking
entry.
	   In an interview on Deutschlandfunk radio in Cologne, Guido
Westerwelle, the General Secretary of the junior coalition centrist
Free Democrats, said Herrmann's proposal ``lacked basic
knowledge.''
	   Westerwelle said he could only try to explain Hermann's
comment's as coming from someone ``who is trying to compete in a
race with radical rightists.''
	   He said the proposal was ``awakening ghosts that one can't be
rid of later,'' and gave ``cause for concern.''
	   Hermann contacted by reporters tried to play down his
suggestion, saying it was already practiced in the European Union
at airports that have special gates for EU passengers to process
more rapidly through customs.
	   In another development Friday, the Berlin-based Tageszeitung
newspaper reported that about 130 prominent people, including
author Guenter Grass and theology professor Friedrich Schorlemmer,
have signed a petition appealing to all political parties to
refrain from using the foreigners' issue in the election campaign.
	   That issue was used by the radical rightist German People's
Union party in eastern Saxony Anhalt in April when it won nearly 13
percent of the vote to gain 16 seats in the state parliament.
	   Germany's national parliament elections are set for Sept. 27.

World Cup: Life stops in Italy for match with France
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with post-game reaction &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ There was no horn-blaring, no hopping into Baroque
fountains, no joy in Italy.
	   There's no such thing as ``just another game'' when it comes to
Italy and the World Cup, and an estimated nine out of every 10
televisions in this soccer-loving country tuned in Friday as the
Azzurri lost to France 4-3 on penalty kicks in the quarterfinals.
	   ``We suffered. I'm sick now,'' said Vicenzo Bellisario, a barman
at a cafe on Piazza Venezia in the heart of Rome. ``In 1990 we lost
on penalty kicks, again in 1994, and now in 1998. At least once we
could do it.''
	   About two dozen city and paramilitary police stood idly in that
major square, the site of wild celebrations after each win four
years ago as Italy made its run to the title game. That time,
Roberto Baggio sent a penalty kick high in a shootout against
Brazil.
	   This time it was Luigi Di Biagio, a player for one of the
capital's clubs, who sent the final kick crashing off the bar.
	   ``We Italians knew before the game that if it went to penalties
we would lose,'' said Antonio Di Fiore, a waiter at a restaurant
that faces the French embassy in Rome. ``We are always unlucky when
it comes to shootouts. I think our team was too distracted to play
well.''
	   Nearby, three French women who live in Rome draped themselves in
a red-blue-and-white tricolor.
	   ``We were beautiful. Italy did not play well. They were
overconfident about winning,'' said Claudine Assni. ``We played
better. The French are exquisite people and deserved to win.''
	   By the early afternoon, the normally bustling historic center
was an eerie quiet generally reserved for national holidays. Police
were closing off traffic on a main thoroughfare near the Spanish
Steps during and after the match in case of victory celebrations.
	   Thousands of people gathered at eight spots around the capital
where giant screens were set up to broadcast the game. Outdoor
viewing was also available in several cities across Italy, from
Florence to Milan, where even a thunder-and-lightning downpour
could not keep viewers away.
	   After Italy wins World Cup matches, the streets are packed with
celebrants, many of whom zoom on Vespas while holding large flags
that flap in the wind.
	   On Friday, one man slowly drove past Piazza Venezia on a moped,
a red-white-and green flag draped solemnly over his legs.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Fires started by nomadic livestock
herders, charcoal burners and a tourist have destroyed about a
quarter of Tsavo East National Park, the Kenya Wildlife Service
said Friday.
	   Several fires set by herders and charcoal burners, which began
last Saturday, have been extinguished, John Muhanga, the region's
assistant director at Tsavo East, said Friday. However, another
started by a lit cigarette apparently dropped by a tourist,
continued to burn, he said. It wa snot immediately clear when that
fire started.
	   ``We have mobilized everything on the ground. It is a big fire
with large fronts due to changes of wind directions,'' Muhanga
said. ``We have managed to bring it under control, we are now
fighting its dying stages.''
	   Fire has destroyed nearly 365 square kilometers (145 square
miles) of Tsavo East's 1,100 square kilomoters (440 square miles).
	   Tsavo East, together with the larger Tsavo West, comprise the
biggest wildlife park in this East African nation. Together, they
have 20,000 square kilometers (8,000 square miles) and are located
about 290 kilometers (180 miles) southeast of the capital Nairobi.
	   Most of the endangered spiecies such rhino and hirolla antelope
have their sanctuaries in Tsavo East.
	   Muhanga said fire has destroyed nearly all grassland in the
southeastern part of the park. Animals have fled the fire to
ranches around the park and unaffected areas, he said.
	   ``Some small animals, like baboons which climbed on trees, have
been burned. But the large animals have escaped the fire,'' Muhanga
said.

Lopez falters on second day of Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEDES with Nancy Lopez out of contention; TRIMS to tighten.
All players from the United States unless otherwise noted. &QL; 
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ Nancy Lopez will have to wait at least
another year to win a U.S. Open, the only trophy missing from her
Hall of Fame career.
	   Lopez, a four-time runnerup at the Open who struck the ball well
on Thursday but finished with a 6-over-par 77, birdied the first
four holes Friday before running into a string of bad luck that
lasted an excruciating eight holes.
	   Lopez didn't make par from the fifth hole to the 12th,
collecting five bogeys and three double-bogeys on the unforgiving
Blackwolf Run Golf Course.
	   Her nightmarish run ended with a par-3 on the 142-yard
(130-meter) 13th hole, at which time she was 17-over-par, 20
strokes off the lead.
	   Lopez's husband, former major leaguer Ray Knight, walked the
course with her, often holding her hand as they went from one hole
to the next.
	   Despite her tough day, Lopez still drew cheers from the gallery.
	   ``I think that probably carries more pressure for her,'' Knight
said. ``She wants to please people. The struggles she is going
through right now just makes that harder and puts more pressure on
her to do well.''
	   Kim Williams, the surprising first-round co-leader, also had a
rough round Friday.
	   She had three bogeys and a double-bogey on her first seven
holes, falling out of the first-round lead she shared with Laura
Davies of Britain at 3-under-par 68.
	   Having never won in 12 years on the LPGA tour, Williams' early
success was as surprising as Lopez's frustration.
	   But Williams, whose great opening round came exactly four years
after the terrifying night she was struck by a stray bullet, had no
illusions about her chances.
	   ``Who knows how my back will feel tomorrow?'' she said Thursday.
``I'm happy just that I was able to play. That was a big concern,
that I wasn't going to be able to play.''
	   After all, her back, which she injured in the second tournament
of the year, limited her to nine holes of practice in the month
leading up to the Open.
	   Karen Noble got the second round off to a big start this morning
when she eagled the par-4, 340-yard(311-meter) first hole. But she
finished with a 7-over-par 78 for a two-day total of 13-over 155.
	   After 36 holes, the 60 lowest scorers and ties, or anyone within
10 strokes of the lead, will make the cut.

Defector's father says his son was accountant, not scientist
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Khan's lawyer saying his client's family
threatened by Pakistan security; his client wants asylum before
giving more information. NO PICKUP &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The father of the man who claimed to
be a nuclear scientist with secret information about Pakistan's
nuclear program said Friday that his son was an accountant at a
company that makes ceramic tiles and bathroom fixtures.
	   In an interview with Pakistan's state-run television, Sikander
Khan said his son, Iftikhar Chaudhary Khan, was not a scientist.
	   ``He never worked as a scientist,'' Khan told Pakistan
Television. ``He was a business commerce student. He didn't study
science.''
	   In interviews in the United States, Khan claimed to be a nuclear
scientist who attended a secret meeting where Pakistan mapped out
plans to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against its uneasy
neighbor India.
	   He said he fled to the United States to protest his country's
plan to be the first to use nuclear weapons. He also promised to
hand over documents to substantiate his claims, but only after
being granted asylum.
	   In New York, Khan's lawyer, Michael Wildes said his client spoke
to his father on Thursday and was told then that his family was
being threatened by Pakistan's secret service.
	   The elder Khan warned his son that he would disavow him ``for
his own safety,'' according to Wildes, who said he filed Thursday
for political asylum for his client claiming his life would be in
danger if he returned to Pakistan.
	   ``He defected for political reasons. We believe he has a
reasonable fear of persecution . . . if he were to return to
Pakistan. He would be executed,'' Wildes said.
	   But Wildes said his client won't give up his information until
he is granted asylum and if the United States isn't interested he
said other Western countries are.
	   Wildes said his client has been approached by other Western
countries interested in the information he has to offer. He refused
to identify the countries.
	   Meanwhile, Pakistan urged both Canada and the United States to
investigate how Khan was able to get visas ``when genuine
applicants face hardships getting visas to Western countries.''
	   Canada has said that it's looking into the matter. Khan passed
through Canada on his way to the United States.
	   Information Minister Mushahid Hussein, whose comments were
carried by the state-run news agency, also said the Pakistani
government would conduct an investigation.
	   Asad Gulzar Sheikh, director of Forte Trading Company (Pvt)
Limited, said Thursday that he was Khan's boss for four years until
November 1997, when Khan resigned.
	   Sheikh said Khan was an assistant accountant who earned 5,000
rupees a month, the equivalent of dlrs 120, when he quit his job.
It wasn't immediately clear why he resigned.
	   Hussein called Khan's allegations ``a false story aimed at
maligning Pakistan and exacerbating tension in the region.''
	   India and Pakistan both conducted underground nuclear tests in
May sparking fears of a nuclear arms race on the Asian
subcontinent, an area that has seen three wars in the last 51
years.
	   Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub dismissed as ``nonsense''
Khan's allegation that Pakistan was planning a first strike against
India.
	   The government also said scientists are not involved in meetings
to map out combat strategy.
	   On Thursday, the U.S. State Department said it had no
information to support Khan's claims.
	   ``We do note significant discrepancies in his story as reported
in the press,'' said State Department spokesman James Rubin,
declining to elaborate.
	   The U.S. State Department has no information to support Khan's
claim that Pakistan was planning a pre-emptive strike on Indian
nuclear facilities, Rubin said.

Lebanon arrests 11 former Christian militiamen for bombings

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese security forces have arrested 11
former members of a right-wing Christian militia suspected of
involvement in a series of bombings aimed at destabilizing the
country.
	   A statement issued by security sources and carried by the
official media said the men were behind a 1996 attack against a
Syrian bus that killed its driver and an explosion at the main bus
terminal in downtown Beirut in October 1997 that caused no
casualties.
	   It said the men may also have been behind an attack that
targeted the U.S. Embassy, but left no casualties.
	   The statement did not say when the 11 were arrested.
	   It said, however, that two members of the group were killed in
Beirut on June 12 when a bomb that they were transporting exploded
prematurely.
	   The statement said an investigation by the Lebanese army's
Intelligence Department revealed that four of the suspects belonged
to a ``shock troop'' cell of the former Lebanese Forces militia
that received orders via the internet from a militia office in
Australia.
	   A member of the Lebanese Forces political council in Australia
denied any involvement.
	   ``We have had nothing to do with this matter or any other
matters,'' Tony Chidiac told the Australian Associated Press in
Sydney.
	   The Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia during the
1975-90 civil war, was disbanded by the Syrian-backed government in
1994 and its leaders jailed.
	   During the war, the militia opposed Syrian influence and had
close ties to Israel. Syria maintains some 30,000 soldiers in
Lebanon and is the main power broker in the country.
	   The statement also said the group planned to assassinate three
unnamed political and security officials.
	   However, the state-run National News Agency said Friday evening
that Interior Minister Michel Murr and Minister of Electricity and
Hydraulic Resources Elias Hobeika were among those targeted by the
group.
	   The group had planned to kill Murr in a car bomb and Hobeika by
a sniper's fire, the agency said, quoting unnamed officials
investigating the case.
	   Defense Minister Mohsen Dalloul said the group was ``entirely
linked'' to Israel. ``The group's mission was to undermine security
and stability in the country,'' he said.
	   Last month, several members of the Lebanese Forces won seats in
municipal elections in Christian areas. It was their first
political participation after boycotting elections since the end of
the civil war.

Abiola wife says he'll be free soon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Annan quotes, EDITS to
conform. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By GILBERT DA COSTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Moshood Abiola, Nigeria's best-known
political prisoner and the presumed winner of presidential
elections in 1993, will probably be freed in the coming days, one
of his wives has said.
	   ``We have every reason to believe he will be freed any moment
from now,'' Doyin Abiola, who manages Abiola's newspaper group,
told Lagos Radio late Thursday night.
	   Mrs. Abiola also said she had met with Emeka Anyaoku, the
secretary-general of the commonwealth of former British colonies,
since his meeting with her husband earlier this week. But she gave
no further details.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced Thursday that
Nigeria will free all of its remaining political prisoners,
including Abiola. He gave no timetable on the releases, just saying
``the government will make an announcement at the appropriate
time.''
	   There are believed to be between 250 and 280 political prisoners
still held in Nigerian prisons, though thousands were arrested at
various times during the rule of Gen. Sani Abacha, the Nigerian
dictator who died last month. His successor, Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar, has repeatedly signaled that he intends to break from his
predecessor's policies.
	   Annan, speaking Friday in Accra, Ghana where he was meeting with
President Jerry Rawlings and other top officials, said he believed
Nigeria would again become a democratic country.
	   ``I am sure it can be done,'' Annan, who is Ghanaian, said at a
press conference. ``Abubakar seems determined to return the country
to constitutional rule.''
	   He said the United Nations would offer assistance to Nigeria
during the electoral process and urged the rest of the
international community to do the same.
	   Nigeria's Provisional Ruling Council, meanwhile, the core of the
ruling junta, met Thursday night to discuss the releases,
government officials said on condition of anonymity. However, it
was not immediate clear whether their meeting was continuing
Friday.

Montgomerie injury opens the way for challengers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Tony Johnstone fired a 4-under 67 and
Craig Hainline and John McHenry had 68s to share the Irish Open
lead Friday as first-round leader Colin Montgomerie severely
sprained his ankle in a fall signing autographs.
	   Montgomerie, the two-time defending champion, had a 3-over 74 to
fall a shot off the pace at 139 to 138 for the three leaders.
	   Montgomerie suffered the ankle injury signing autographs before
the match and declined suggestions he should withdraw.
	   ``I did it signing autographs,'' explained Montgomerie. ``I was
doing them on the walk because otherwise I'd be there all day, but
I tripped over a stone and tore a ligament.''
	   These are three crucial weeks for Montgomerie with Loch Lomond
next week and the British Open after that, where he will be after
his first win in a major.
	   ``It was all right for nine holes, but then it started to get
very sore and I lost my balance,'' he said in explanation of of a
drive on the 11th that hit a tree and went only 120 yards, a bogey
at the 13th and then a triple bogey two holes later.
	   ``I'm going to play through it. I've been told to rest, but I
can't. This week is too important, so is Loch Lomond next week and
so, of course, is the Open.
	   `I'm only one behind here and I'm still possibly favorite. In my
own eyes I am.''
	   Ernie Els, the No. 2-ranked player in the world, recovered from
two early double bogeys for a second successive 71 and is level
par. Nick Faldo and Ian Woosnam just survived the halfway cut, both
at 5-over 147.

Guyana capital returns to normal as pact ends street
</HEADLINE>
demonstrations &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Minority political leaders hailed an
agreement between the two major political parties that ended three
weeks of sometimes-violent street demonstrations and allowed
business to return to normal Friday.
	   The handshake between President Janet Jagan and opposition
leader Desmond Hoyte that sealed the deal was featured in
front-page photos in both daily newspapers and was cautiously but
widely acclaimed.
	   ``I think that we've clearly been pulled back from the brink and
we have all won,'' said Rupert Roopnarine, leader of the Alliance
for Guyana, a minor political party.
	   Hoyte's People's National Congress protested and alleged fraud
after Jagan defeated him in the Dec. 15, 1997 presidential
election. Protests erupted again last month even though an
international committee reviewed the elections and found them to be
fair.
	   Stores in the downtown business district of Georgetown, the
capital of this South American country, reopened Friday after weeks
of lost business due to the disturbances.
	   Jagan and Hoyte reached an agreement Thursday at the 19th annual
summit of Caribbean Community leaders in St. Lucia. The pact calls
for an end to street protests, the return of Hoyte's party to the
Parliament, which it had boycotted, and speedy progress on
constitutional and parliamentary reforms.
	   ``It is good to see both parties arrive at common ground,'' said
Manzoor Nadir, leader of the United Force political party, which
has one seat in Parliament. ``Agreements are often violated, but
this one puts us one step closer to the return of normalcy in
Guyana.''
	   The political tensions also have racial overtones as Jagan's
party is dominated by Guyanese of East Indian descent while Hoyte's
followers are mostly blacks of African ancestry.

French victory sparks wild celebration; Italians distraught
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ An elderly French woman said she hadn't seen so
many youngsters smiling in years. Nearby, a distraught Italian sat
with his flag on the floor, cursing his luck.
	   For two hours, the streets of Paris were virtually deserted
Friday while France and Italy battled it out in a tense, scoreless
World Cup quarter-final match.
	   But straight after France's penalty shootout victory, the
streets went wild, with tens of thousands of people swarming the
Champs-Elysees to celebrate France's first World Cup semi-final
appearance since 1986.
	   One reveler, stripped to the waist, uncorked a crate of
champagne, spraying crowds along the city's famous avenue.
Policemen desperately tried to wave traffic away as supporters
marched up and down the middle of the road.
	   No self-respecting driver dared not hoot his horn.
	   ``In recent years, I'd come to the conclusion that all
youngsters were miserable,'' said Jacqueline Pinard, an elegant
woman in her 60s watching crowds embracing, dancing and waving
French flags.
	   ``With unemployment, they haven't had much to be cheerful
about,'' she added. ``I never considered myself a soccer fan. But
now I see the good it does.''
	   ``We're in the semis, We're in the semis,'' the crowds screamed.
``Allez Les Bleus,'' and ``Where are the Italians, where are the
Italians?''
	   One of them was in a restaurant just two blocks away.
	   Desolate at Italy's second defeat in a penalty shootout in
successive World Cups, Roberto Cantarella said ``it just wasn't
meant to be.''
	   In 1994 it was even worse, Italy losing the World Cup final on
penalties to Brazil.
	   ``But this time we were awful,'' Cantarella said. ``We were too
scared to attack. Too timid. Good luck to the French. They deserved
it more.''
	   French President Jacques Chirac watched the match at the Stade
de France, and went to the French team's changing room after the
match to congratulate them personally.
	   ``This is sheer happiness after total stress,'' Chirac said
after the match. ``The whole team was extraordinary.''
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, arms aloft alongside Chirac after
the penalty shooutout victory, described the French team as
``beautiful.''
	   At first he said he would prefer Croatia as a semi-final
opponent. But then opted for Germany, citing the need for
``revenge'' against the country that knocked France out of the 1986
World Cup at the same stage.
	   Outside Paris City Hall, thousands of fans watched the match on
a giant screen. Elsewhere, workers crowded around television sets
in offices and bars.
	   ``I was very anxious throughout the match,'' said Mathieu
Fortier, 17. ``I thought we'd win 1-0, but Italy had a strong
defense.''
	   Lara Picchi, a 30-year-old Italian, said the Italian players had
``no spirit.''
	   ``I'm very upset,'' she said. ``It's always the same when it

	   Paul Brindle, an Englishman, said the penalty shootout brought
back painful memories of England's defeat Tuesday night against
Argentina. ``It's no way to be knocked out of the World Cup,'' he
said. ``I know just how the poor Italians feel.''

Russian president asks Gazprom to help country's cash crisis

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin tried to smooth over
relations Friday with Gazprom, Russia's largest company, asking the
gas monopoly's help in resolving the government's cash crisis by
paying its back taxes.
	   The president's spin session with the director of Gazprom came
one day after the Kremlin threatened tough action, then had to back
off in an embarrassing about face.
	   Yeltsin used both approaches Friday, asking for Gazprom's help
and at the same time demanding a new payment schedule in 24 hours.
	   Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky described the
meeting as ``a rather hard conversation.''
	   ``The president suggested that a complete solution to the
situation be worked out in one day,'' the spokesman said.
	   Like many Russian companies, Gazprom has trouble paying its
taxes. As a result, the government has trouble paying its own
bills, including wages and pensions.
	   Yeltsin called the cash crisis a ``vicious circle,'' and asked
Gazprom director Rem Vyakhirev to pay taxes even when Gazprom
clients don't pay their bills.
	   ``You have to pay in full, regardless of whether you are being
paid,'' Yeltsin told Vyakhirev in remarks broadcast on television.
``Otherwise, we get a vicious circle.''
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko provoked the fracas Thursday
when he tried to make an example of Gazprom, ordering authorities
to seize the company's property unless it paid overdue June taxes.
	   But Gazprom is revered as one of the few stars in Russia's
tattered economy, and swift denunciations from lawmakers and others
forced Kiriyenko to call off the seizures and reach a quick payment
settlement.
	   He, too, tried to put the best face on the about-face Friday.
	   ``The state has begun enforcing tax payments,'' Kiriyenko told a
news conference. ``Nothing extraordinary is happening.''
	   Kiriyenko is under strong pressure to increase Russia's tax
collections to qualify for a new loan from the International
Monetary Fund that is expected to top dlrs 10 billion.
	   He made clear that the government intends to lean heavily on
other companies as well, including one of Gazprom's chief
customers, the national power utility UES.
	   ``Let's get used to the idea that taxes must be paid,''
Kiriyenko said.
	   Kiriyenko said Gazprom has agreed to pay about 4 billion rubles
(about dlrs 750 million) in taxes each month. It was not clear how
much of that would go to pay its back taxes, which he said were
between 2 billion and 3 billion rubles (dlrs 330 million and dlrs
500 million).
	   Gazprom said the government owed it 1 billion rubles more (dlrs
163 million), than it owed the government.
	   ``We suggest both parties fulfill their obligations,'' said
Gazprom vice chairman Sergei Zverev, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   The government made clear Friday that it will consider writing
off at least some of Gazprom's tax bill.
	   Vyakhirev, the Gazprom chief, dashed back to Moscow from a
business trip in Vienna and appeared irked at the whole
controversy, telling reporters it was ``a provocation.''
	   Opposition lawmakers seemed to agree. The State Duma unanimously
passed a resolution calling the government's actions toward Gazprom
``inadmissible'' and vowing to protect the country's so-called
``natural monopolies.''
	   They also took action on several bills that form part of the
government's plan to rescue the Russian economy from its crisis.
They gave preliminary approval to the main part of the government's
new tax code, but rejected a proposed 5 percent sales tax.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov had said the tax would have
brought in 40 billion rubles (about dlrs 7 billion), but many Duma
deputies oppose flat-rate taxes, calling them socially unfair.
	   Gazprom, which has close to 400,000 employees, controls
production and distribution of Russia's vast natural gas supplies,
and is one of Western Europe's largest suppliers.

French victory sparks wild celebration; Italians distraught

	   PARIS (AP) _ An elderly French woman said she hadn't seen so
many youngsters smiling in years. Nearby, a distraught Italian sat
with his flag on the floor, cursing his luck.
	   For two hours, the streets of Paris were virtually deserted
Friday while France and Italy battled it out in a tense, scoreless
World Cup quarter-final match.
	   But straight after France's penalty shootout victory, the
streets went wild, with tens of thousands of people swarming the
Champs-Elysees to celebrate France's first World Cup semi-final
appearance since 1986.
	   One reveler, stripped to the waist, uncorked a crate of
champagne, spraying crowds along the city's famous avenue.
Policemen desperately tried to wave traffic away as supporters
marched up and down the middle of the road.
	   No self-respecting driver dared not hoot his horn.
	   ``In recent years, I'd come to the conclusion that all
youngsters were miserable,'' said Jacqueline Pinard, an elegant
woman in her 60s watching crowds embracing, dancing and waving
French flags.
	   ``With unemployment, they haven't had much to be cheerful
about,'' she added. ``I never considered myself a soccer fan. But
now I see the good it does.''
	   ``We're in the semis, We're in the semis,'' the crowds screamed.
``Allez Les Bleus,'' and ``Where are the Italians, where are the
Italians?''
	   One of them was in a restaurant just two blocks away.
	   Desolate at Italy's second defeat in a penalty shootout in
successive World Cups, Roberto Cantarella said ``it just wasn't
meant to be.''
	   In 1994 it was even worse, Italy losing the World Cup final on
penalties to Brazil.
	   ``But this time we were awful,'' Cantarella said. ``We were too
scared to attack. Too timid. Good luck to the French. They deserved
it more.''
	   French President Jacques Chirac watched the match at the Stade
de France, and went to the French team's changing room after the
match to congratulate them personally.
	   ``This is sheer happiness after total stress,'' Chirac said
after the match. ``The whole team was extraordinary.''
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, arms aloft alongside Chirac after
the penalty shooutout victory, described the French team as
``beautiful.''
	   At first he said he would prefer Croatia as a semi-final
opponent. But then opted for Germany, citing the need for
``revenge'' against the country that knocked France out of the 1986
World Cup at the same stage.
	   Outside Paris City Hall, thousands of fans watched the match on
a giant screen. Elsewhere, workers crowded around television sets
in offices and bars.
	   ``I was very anxious throughout the match,'' said Mathieu
Fortier, 17. ``I thought we'd win 1-0, but Italy had a strong
defense.''
	   Lara Picchi, a 30-year-old Italian, said the Italian players had
``no spirit.''
	   ``I'm very upset,'' she said. ``It's always the same when it
comes to penalties.''
	   Paul Brindle, an Englishman, said the penalty shootout brought
back painful memories of England's defeat Tuesday night against
Argentina. ``It's no way to be knocked out of the World Cup,'' he
said. ``I know just how the poor Italians feel.''

 &UR; At 98, Cape Cod woman receives high school diploma
	   BOSTON (AP) _ At 98, Eugenie Garside received her high school
diploma.
	   The nonagenarian _ who left the third grade in 1909 to help care
for her 11 younger siblings _ received a standing ovation as she
moved her walker across the stage to receive her degree Sunday from
a Cape Cod high School.
	   Some of the loudest cheers came from the kids 80 years Miss
Garside's junior who had helped tutor and grade her for a year and
a half.
	   ``I was so happy, and I say, `Thank you,' to all the people who
helped me and understood me,'' Miss Garside said Monday. ``It's
kind of late, but I'm glad I have it.''
	   Now, the hard-won diploma with its gold seal and black leather
case sits by Miss Garside's bed at the Pleasant Bay Nursing and
Rehabilitation Center in Brewster next to piles of congratulation
cards. And Miss Garside is acting like any other recent high school
graduate.
	   ``Now I'm going to rest and be lazy,'' she laughed.
	   Miss Garside's graduation odyssey began almost two years ago
after she confided to a nursing home staffer her dream of getting a
diploma.
	   The nursing home contacted the principal of Nauset Regional High
School in Eastham. He recruited several students to tutor his
oldest student in science, math, history and literature.
	   The former nanny and housekeeper regularly underwent
rehabilitation for hip and joint problems in the morning and an
hour of tutoring in the afternoon. Her student tutors gave her
pass-fail oral exams.
	   ``She never stopped wanting to learn,'' said Cyrena Wooster, 18.
``I cried when I saw her get her diploma. I worked hard to
graduate, but this is something she'd wanted her whole life.''
	   Nauset Regional's seniormost senior decided to skip the
post-graduation all-night trip aboard a cruise ship. In September,
when most graduates head off to work or college, Miss Garside will
also have a milestone to celebrate _ her 99th birthday.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Senior Graduates at Age 98

World Cup: France wins shootout to advance to semis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Optional &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ For Italy, it was third time and
again unlucky in a penalty shootout. For France, it was another
victorious chapter in a great World Cup adventure _ and luck had
nothing to do it.
	   Eliminated by spot kicks in both the 1990 semifinal against
Argentina and the 1994 final against Brazil, the Azzurri left
France 98 the same way Friday, dropping the shootout 4-3 after a
0-0 tie as the French reached the Cup semifinals for the first time
in 12 years.
	   ``It's a sort of a curse,'' Italian coach Cesare Maldini said.
``We're walking out of this stadium with our heads up. It's a pity
because it really is a lottery when you go to a shootout. I have no
regrets.''
	   That's not how it was seen by the hosts.
	   ``It takes the coolest heads to win,'' French coach Aime Jacquet
said. ``We didn't lose our nerve. In the end, the best team won.''
	   None come cooler than defender Laurent Blanc, who netted the
shootout decider six days after scoring the World Cup's first
``Golden Goal'' in France's 1-0 second round victory over Paraguay.
	   After a 120-minute thriller in which playmaker Zinedine Zidane
did everything for France but score the winner, it came down to 10
tense shots to divide the two neighboring soccer giants. Luigi Di
Biagio crashed Italy's fifth attempt onto the bar, releasing the
crowd of 80,000 at the Stade de France into wild celebrations.
	   ``I'm really sorry, so sorry,'' said Di Biagio, taking over the
apologetic mantle from Roberto Baggio, who missed the final penalty
in the shootout loss to Brazil four years ago.
	   ``It's hard to go out of the World Cup this way,'' said Demetrio
Albertini, who had his shootout attempt saved by goalkeeper Fabien
Barthez.
	   Zidane, David Trezeguet and Thierry Henry made their kicks for
France. Baggio, Alessandro Costacurta and Christian Vieri converted
for Italy.
	   France's Bixente Lizarazu had his shot saved, and the teams were
neck-and-neck until Blanc nailed his and Di Biagio sent Italy home.
	   France will come back to the Stade de France on Wednesday to
play the winner of Saturday's Germany-Croatia match.
	   The shootout, the second of France 98, came after two hours of
hard physical play and the most refined of tactics could not
produce a goal. France dominated, outshooting the Italians 31-10.
Italy didn't get its first corner kick until the third minute of
the second-half injury time.
	   ``We just wanted this victory more than the Italians did,'' said
French captain Didier Deschamps.
	   Yet Italy almost snatched the game in the 102nd minute, when
Baggio ran onto a long pass from Angelo Di Livio and volleyed the
ball without controlling it. It was a piece of magic from the
veteran, but it swerved just past the far post.
	   Even later, in the 118th minute, Henry put Youri Djorkaeff
through, but the French forward could not lift the ball over his
Inter Milan teammate, goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca.
	   So it came down to penalties and the heart-stopping moments.
	   Even French President Jacques Chirac was held in a spell. ``This
is true happiness after total stress,'' said France's first fan.
	   Throughout the match, Zidane spread play around at ease and
swept past his personal marker Gianluca Pessotto with almost royal
disdain. The lack of a true goalscorer, however, kept Les Bleus
from finding the net.
	   Italy lived with the pressure as long as it could break. In the
ninth minute, Vieri headed just wide and half an hour later his
rising drive at Barthez took a good punching save to deflect the
ball. In the 35th minute, Barthez had to throw his whole body at
Vieri to deny him on a drive.
	   Vieri was controlled by France's smothering defense from then
on. In five World Cup matches, France has only allowed just one
penalty goal.
	   Alessandro Del Piero, who was touted as one of the potential
World Cup stars, was near invisible apart from earning a yellow
card. Maldini, who benched Baggio for Del Piero refused to condemn
the Juventus forward. ``He did his work,'' said Maldini.
	   ``Life goes on,'' said Del Piero.
	   Seven of France's starting lineup are playing in Italy or have
played there in the past few years, including Zidane, making a
comeback after missing two games because of suspension.
	   Although players on both sides were friends, the game was rough,
with 50 fouls called and five yellow cards issued. Afterwards, all
jerseys mingled into bittersweet embraces.
	   ``I'm totally exhausted,'' Jacquet said.

Sampras, Ivanisevic move into final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Optional lead; further Sampras quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Pete Sampras says Tim Henman has the
game to win Wimbledon. Not yet, though. Not when Sampras still owns
Centre Court.
	   Sampras and Henman are close friends and occasional practice and
doubles partners.
	   When they met in Friday's semifinals, Henman had the support of
15,000 Centre Court fans willing him to become the first British
men's finalist in 60 years.
	   But Sampras reasserted his status as grass-court master, turning
back Henman's spirited challenge to win in four sets and move
within one victory of his fifth title in six years.
	   The American, who lost his first set of the tournament, relied
on his superior serve and experience to prevail 6-3, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3.
He had to come up with some of his best tennis against the
12th-seeded Henman.
	   ``There was a lot of emotion out there, especially playing Tim
here in England,'' Sampras said. ``This is what it's all about. You
raise your level of intensity and raise your emotions.''
	   Sampras will play two-time runnerup Goran Ivanisevic in Sunday's
final. It will be a repeat of the 1994 final, which Sampras won in
straight sets.
	   Ivanisevic squandered two match points in the fourth set, then
outlasted Richard Krajicek in a marathon fifth set to win 6-3, 6-4,
5-7, 6-7 (7-5), 15-13. The match lasted 3 hours, 22 minutes, with
the final set alone going 1:19.
	   ``He's got a huge serve,'' Sampras said of Ivanisevic.
``Mentally he was very strong today. He's going to hit his aces,
hit his double faults. You just have to ride the wave with Goran.
You just need to stay patient with him.''
	   The women's final is set for Saturday, with Jana Novotna facing
Nathalie Tauziat.
	   Henman, the first British men's semifinalist in 25 years, had
been aiming to become the first homegrown finalist since Henry
Austin in 1938 and first champion since Fred Perry in 1936.
	   ``One day, he's going to win this thing,'' Sampras said. ``I can
tell you that. He's very, very strong. He does everything very
well. He doesn't have any holes in his game. He's going to learn
from this match.''
	   Henman offered no excuses.
	   ``At 5-6 in the third set, he was the one that came up with the
goods,'' he said. ``It's relentless the way he plays.''
	   By winning Sunday, Sampras would join Bjorn Borg as the only
players in the Open era to win Wimbledon five times. A victory
would also give him a total of 11 Grand Slam titles, one behind
all-time leader Roy Emerson.
	   Returning to the final ended a slump for Sampras, who had failed
to get past the quarters of a a Grand Slam tournament since last
year's Wimbledon.
	   Sampras broke Henman twice to take the first set. But Henman
displayed the full range of his grass-court talents in the second
set, breaking Sampras twice. It was the first set Sampras had lost
in six matches.
	   Henman stayed even with Sampras in the third set until the
American broke in the 12th game. After Henman saved two set points,
Sampras converted on the third, ripping a backhand return which
forced a volley error. He skipped to the back of the court and
pumped his right fist.
	   ``That was a huge game,'' Sampras said. ``It was the key to the
match. I was just able to raise the level a little bit. When I won
the third set, I knew I had him.''
	   Sampras broke, 17th graf

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A cake made of hashish sickened 12
employees of a book publishing house celebrating their first day of
vacation Friday, police said.
	   The 12 experienced headaches and vomiting and had to be
hospitalized, police said. One of the victims was in intensive care
at La Paz Hospital, said police spokeswoman Rafaela Garcia.
	   Two organizers of the party, ages 23 and 24, were detained by
police after they confessed putting the drug in the dessert, Garcia
said.
	   They were held at a Madrid police station and will be questioned
Saturday by a judge.
	   Police did not release the amount of hashish in the cake
although they sent the rest of it to the Institute of Toxicology
for analyzing.

World Cup: Brazil leads 2-1 at halftime
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Ronaldo set up goals for Bebeto and
Rivaldo after the Danes had taken a two-minute lead as defending
champion Brazil took a 2-1 advantage into half time of their World
Cup quarterfinal Friday.
	   Martin Jorgensen surprised the four-time titlist with an early
goal for the outsiders but Bebeto tied the game in the 16th minute
and Rivaldo added a second 10 minutes later at La Beaujoire
stadium.
	   The Danes, who netted two early goals in a 4-1 victory over
Olympic champion Nigeria in the previous round, were at it again
against the world titlists.
	   After Dunga had fouled Peter Moeller just outside the area, they
took the free kick quickly and Brian Laudrup slipped free down the
left. With the Brazilian defense slow to see the danger, he pulled
the ball back to the unmarked Jorgensen who fired first time past
Taffarel from 12 meters (yards) with his left foot.
	   The Brazilians were level in the 11th minute when Ronaldo, on
the halfway line, turned to send a ball through for Bebeto to run
for goal. A veteran of Brazil's 1994 triumph, Bebeto outpaced
Danish marker Thomas Helveg and ran 30 meters before sliding the
ball past 'keeper Peter Schmeichel for his third goal of the
championship.
	   Back on level terms, the Brazilians managed to slow down the
fast pace of the game before striking again in the 26th minute.
	   The Danes were punished for losing possession 30 meters from
their own goal and Ronaldo wasted no time in feeding the ball to
Rivaldo. The Barcelona midfielder had Bebeto alongside as they ran
clear of the defense but needed no help as he drove the ball under
Schmeichel's body with an angled left-foot shot.
	   After surviving a long spell of Brazilian pressure, the Danes
had a chance to level in the 35th minute when the ball found the
unmarked Moeller just outside the Brazilian area. Moeller failed to
control the ball first time and, when he eventually fired at goal,
the shot was straight at Taffarel.
	   Ronaldo almost made it 3-1 four minutes before half time when he
was unchallenged at the far post and headed Dunga's free kick wide.
	   Lineups:
	   Brazil _ Taffarel; Cafu, Junior Baiano, Aldair, Roberto Carlos;
Dunga, Cesar Sampaio, Leonardo, Rivaldo; Ronaldo, Bebeto
	   Denmark _ Peter Schmeichel: Marc Rieper, Jes Hogh, Jan Heintze,
Soren Colding, Thomas Helveg, Allan Nielsen, Martin Jorgensen,
Michael Laudrup; Brian Laudrup, Peter Moller.
	   Referee _ Gamal Ghandour, Egypt

Guyana capital returns to normal as pact ends street
</HEADLINE>
demonstrations &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Minority political leaders hailed an
agreement between the two major political parties that ended three
weeks of sometimes-violent street demonstrations and allowed
business to return to normal Friday.
	   The handshake between President Janet Jagan and opposition
leader Desmond Hoyte that sealed the deal was featured in
front-page photos in both daily newspapers and was cautiously but
widely acclaimed.
	   ``I think that we've clearly been pulled back from the brink and
we have all won,'' said Rupert Roopnarine, leader of the Alliance
for Guyana, a minor political party.
	   Hoyte's People's National Congress protested and alleged fraud
after Jagan defeated him in the Dec. 15 presidential election.
Protests erupted again last month even though an international
committee reviewed the elections and found them to be fair.
	   Stores in the downtown business district of Georgetown, the
capital of this South American country, reopened Friday after weeks
of lost business due to the disturbances.
	   Jagan and Hoyte reached an agreement Thursday at the 19th annual
summit of Caribbean Community leaders in St. Lucia. The pact calls
for an end to street protests, the return of Hoyte's party to the
Parliament, which it boycotted, and speedy progress on
constitutional and parliamentary reforms.
	   ``It is good to see both parties arrive at common ground,'' said
Manzoor Nadir, leader of the United Force political party, which
has one seat in Parliament. ``Agreements are often violated, but
this one puts us one step closer to the return of normalcy in
Guyana.''
	   The political tensions also have racial overtones as Jagan's
party is dominated by Guyanese of East Indian descent while Hoyte's
followers are mostly blacks of African ancestry.

Serbs regain control of key Kosovo crossroads

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) - With U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke in
the Yugoslav capital trying to broker a ceasefire, Serb forces
battled Albanian rebels Friday outside of Kijevo after breaking a
two-week siege of the strategic crossroads village in western
Kosovo province.
	   Serb police entered Kijevo by 7:30 a.m., freeing some 100 Serb
villagers and 50 policemen who had been cut off by the Albanians.
Liberating the village was believed to be a remaining goal for
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in his latest crackdown on
the secessionist province.
	   Hours after the village fell, Holbrooke arrived in Belgrade,
where he began talks with Milosevic aimed at producing a cease-fire
in the region.
	   Holbrooke had said the stand-off between Serbs and Albanians in
Kijevo made the village the ``most dangerous place in Europe,''
which could be the flashpoint for a wider Balkan war.
	   Having the town in Serb hands could signal a turning point in
allowing stalled negotiations to go forward.
	   Both sides reported fighting continued in the area around
Kijevo, 25 kilometers (15 miles) west of the capital Pristina, but
accounts of casualties were conflicting. Journalists were not
immediately allowed into the area.
	   According to Serb police, after Serb forces broke the siege of
the village, they were trying to continue pushing the KLA as far
west as possible.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said after retreating the KLA reinforced
their troops in villages around Kijevo, were fighting reportedly
continued until late Friday.
	   Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo, since Serb forces
stepped up efforts to crush militant resistance in late February.
Milosevic says the crackdown is aimed at Albanian terrorists who
have targeted Serb police and civilians in their militant campaign
for independence.
	   On the eve of Holbrooke's visit, Milosevic denied any repressive
actions and offered to restore the autonomy he yanked from the
province in 1989 on grounds of protecting the Serb minority.
	   Holbrooke is pushing for a cease-fire before trying to get
Milosevic to withdraw his forces. But he and other Western
officials are insistent that Kosovo should not be allowed
independence.
	   Holbrooke will travel to Pristina early Saturday to meet with
ethnic Albanians.
	   During his visit to the region last month, he tried to get the
KLA to break the siege of Kijevo, fearing Serb forces would use
massive force against it, sparking a wider war in the region.
	   Sitting astride the main east-west road in the southern Yugoslav
province, Kijevo has been a flashpoint since the KLA surrounded it
in mid-June and cut off its Serb inhabitants and police. Serb
police had then surrounded the KLA fighters.
	   An ethnic Albanian human rights group in the region claimed many
were killed and wounded in the dawn attack, in which they said the
Serbs targeted five villages with tanks, helicopters and artillery.
	   But Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
their intelligence reports indicated casualties were not high
because the Kosovo Liberation Army saw the attack coming and
retreated without resisting.
	   Underscoring the high tensions throughout Kosovo, a
remote-controlled bomb exploded early Friday in a Serb residential
area of the capital Pristina. No injuries were reported but windows
on nearby buildings and blown out and several cars were damaged in
an attack Serb police blamed on the KLA.

	   ROME (AP) _ The chairman of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, Italy's
largest publicly-held bank, said Friday he was resigning because of
tensions with the treasury ministry over the bank's privatization.
	   In a note, Treasury and Budget Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi
said that Mario Sarcinelli's position was ``not coherent'' with the

World Cup: Victorious French team may help nation deal with racial
</HEADLINE>
tensions &QL; 
 &UR; By MORT ROSENBLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - The French team that bunnyhopped for joy after
beating Italy in the World Cup on Friday is known as the Blues, and
a nation increasingly aware of color hardly noticed that the
players were actually black, brown and white.
	   ``It's a wonderful reflection of the actual state of France,''
exulted Chriraa Abdelmalek, 22, a Moroccan-born French postal
worker in Nantes, who joined in nationwide jubilation from the
car-choked Champs Elysees to remote village squares.
	   France moved to the semifinals in a game as close as soccer can
get, outscoring Italy by a single goal in a tie-breaking shootout
of five kicks after two overtime periods.
	   As the first regulation 90 minutes closed to a scoreless tie,
the 80,000-seat Stade de France rang with a spontaneous ``La
Marsaillaise.'' In bars and livingrooms from Normandy to Provence,
every blocked kick and stolen ball evoked loud cheers.
	   Reaction was especially fervent in what are called ``sensitive
neighborhoods,'' the working class suburbs, heavily populated with
immigrant families, which ring most French cities.
	   ``Football brings young people together like nothing else,''
said Philippe Debarge, a Paris landscape artist from an old French
family whose own son is nearing 20. ``For us, it is the great
equalizer.''
	   Before the World Cup began, Jean-Marie Le Pen of the
extreme-right National Front complained of too many shades of dark
on the French team. He criticized what he said was undue haste in
granting papers to football players from Africa.
	   Le Pen's party campaigns under a slogan of ``The French First''
and argues that immigrants should be sent home to their country of
origin. The National Front regularly polls up to 20 percent in
French elections, and it controls several cities.
	   But hardly anyone seemed anxious to see Zinedine Zidane wearing
any other jersey. ``Zizou,'' cornerstone of the Blues, grew up in
one of the most sensitive neighborhoods of Marseille, the son of an
Algerian night watchman.
	   Thierry Henry, another hero, was born in Paris to parents from
the Caribbean island of Guadaloupe. Marcel Desailly is from Ghana.
Christian Karembou is a Kanak from New Caledonia. Bernard Lama is
Guyanese.
	   Along with Bretons and Basques, there are Armenians and Africans
and shades of uncounted other cultures.
	   ``This is a great image for France,'' said Matthieu Wycisk, a
twenty-something soccer fan in blue, white and red on the jammed
metro to the stadium. His roots are Polish, like those of Raymond
Kopa, a French great of the 1950s who remains a national hero.
	   En route to the stadium, people seemed orderly, almost
self-conscious, as French crowds tend to be. Although many love the
game, the French are not particularly soccer-mad.
	   Sebastian Lhoumeau of Bordeaux took a cool approach to the
impending match, calculating France's chances to get beyond third
place _ the best it has ever done in a World Cup _ and speculating
on strategy.
	   ``We don't get that excited,'' he explained. ``We're not
Brazilians or Italians.''
	   But that was before. The long, tense match triggered a wild
swirl of blue, white and red flags, a cacophony of honking horns,
and a familiar chant that translates: ``Who are the best?
Obviously, it's us.''
	   Across France, crowds chanted, ``We won.''
	   For many Frenchmen, the victory was less about soccer than it
was a simple assertion of French glory.
	   President Jacques Chirac, grinning broadly, lauded the Blues and
predicted that it would bring France the World Cup in the final
game on July 10.
	   ``We have a superb team,'' he said. ``Why not superb
ambitions?''

Queen Elizabeth II ``not amused'' by England soccer team's

disallowed goal

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ Along with most of her nation, Queen
Elizabeth II took exception to England's disallowed goal during the
country's thrilling World Cup soccer match against Argentina on
Tuesday.
	   ``We are not amused,'' the queen said, in a parody of the famous
quote by her ancestor, Queen Victoria, according to a witness who
was with her when defender Sol Campbell's header was disallowed 11
minutes from the end of the match. The teams finished the game at
2-2.
	   ``She was excited at the standard of football on display, but
she was disappointed when the goal was disallowed,'' said Eric
Milligan, mayor of Edinburgh. ``She said `one is not amused', in a
parody.''
	   On the night of the game, the queen had hosted a dinner party at
her Edinburgh residence, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, timed to end
so that the royal party, including about 10 palace officials and
the Duke of Edinburgh, could watch the match, said David Anderson,
superintendent of the palace.
	   Anderson said that after extra time, the queen retired to her
private apartments in the palace to watch the penalty shoot-out
which England lost 3-4. Her reaction to the final score was not
known, Anderson said.

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ A judge has ordered
the arrests of least 12 former officials of the Chiapas state
attorney general's office for allegedly failing to stop the
December massacre of 45 people, mostly women and children.
	   The warrants, which accuse the 12 of being aware of the massacre
in Acteal but doing nothing to stop it, were issued Tuesday but not
publicized. Chiapas Justice Tribunal President Noe Castallon
confirmed the orders Friday.
	   The 12 were said to be in Chenalho, the municipality that
includes Acteal, when the violence occurred. Pro-government
paramilitaries have been blamed for the killings in the village,
whose residents are sympathetic to leftist Zapatista rebels.
	   The warrants charge the 12 with abuse of authority and
dereliction of duty, and crimes against the administration of
justice. The suspects resigned their posts and some apparently fled
after word leaked to them they would be charged.
	   The suspects included Deputy Attorney General David Gomez
Hernandez and investigators Felipe Moreno Jimenez, Moises Moreno,
Alfredo Alvares, Manuel Valadez, Sergio Saldana Ramirez and Juana
Isabel Gutierrez.
	   Moreno Jimenez, who had not been detained as of Friday because
he has sought a restraining order against his arrest, said he may
have been singled out for prosecution because he is a low-ranking
official and, like the paramilitaries and massacre victims, an
Indian.
	   ``Let them punish, 7th graf pvs.

IBM to stop bidding on Argentine government contracts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Reeling from an alleged kickbacks
scheme, International Business Machine Corp (IBM) will no longer
seek new contracts from the Argentine government, a company
spokesman said Friday.
	   The decision comes as Argentine authorities continue to
investigate a dlrs 249 million contract awarded to IBM Argentina SA
in 1994 to computerize branches of the state-owned Banco de la
Nacion Argentina, the nation's largest bank.
	   Sebastian Mocorrea, an IBM Argentina spokesman, said the company
informed government officials 15 days ago that, effective July 1,
it won't seek any new government contracts _ either those awarded
directly or via public bidding _ but would continue to provide
needed maintenance services for IBM equipment.
	   ``The decision is a business decision,'' Mocorrea said. ``The
immense majority of our revenues comes from the private sector.''
	   But he admitted ``the company has image problems'' from the
ongoing investigation into the Banco Nacion deal.
	   ``This decision is going to help clarify that there's no link''
between former IBM Argentina officials charged in the case and the
new top brass at IBM's local unit, Mocorrea said.

Conference highlights worldwide chasm in availability of AIDS care

	   GENEVA (AP) _ ``Bridging the gap,'' read signs draped everywhere
around the 12th World AIDS Conference. But by meeting's end Friday,
the message to many seemed just the opposite: The chasm between
haves and have-nots in fighting the global epidemic is only
widening.
	   Around the world, nearly 34 million people are infected with
HIV. Since the international meeting began Monday, about 100,000
more caught the virus.
	   Perhaps 4 percent live in the United States, Western Europe and
a few other places where patients routinely get the powerful AIDS
medicines that can keep the virus in check.
	   ``Medical advances present us with a painful paradox,'' said
Anna Luisa Liguori, who works with the MacArthur Foundation in
Mexico. ``The greater the advances in clinical research, the
greater the gap between those who can afford the best treatment and
those who can afford no treatment at all.''
	   Treating just one person with the standard triple combinations
of drugs costs dlrs 10,000 or more. According to one estimate at
the meeting, making these available worldwide would cost dlrs 36.5
billion, two-thirds of that in Africa.
	   ``Bridge the gap?'' asked Dodji Mathey of Togo. ``I don't think
so. It is not possible for the new medicines to ever get to Africa.
We are too poor.''
	   Among the meeting's 13,371 attendees, less than one-quarter were
_ like Mathey _ from the parts of the world were many children die
because of lack of basic antibiotics and even clean drinking water.
	   Where he lives, 9 percent of adults are infected with HIV. In
some African countries, the figures approach 30 percent.
	   With no effective AIDS vaccine close to development, the only
way to stop the epidemic in these places is to keep people from
getting infected. The primary approach is to make condoms cheap and
abundant and to convince people to use them.
	   Mathey paid his own way to the conference to present data on a
program he runs in Lome, the capital. It educates scooter taxi
drivers to chat up their passengers about condoms. But he could not
pull together the dlrs 20,000 in Geneva that he needs to keep the
effort going.
	   In at least one area, though, the benefits of AIDS drug research
may make its way to the world's poorest. Giving the drug AZT to
infected women during pregnancy helps keep them from passing HIV to
their babies during birth.
	   Studies at the conference show that dlrs 50 worth of the
medicine cuts this risk in half. During the meeting, the United
Nations AIDS program said it would start a pilot program to bring
AZT to about 30,000 women in poor countries in Asia, Africa and
South America.
	   There are some 1,600 cases of mother-to-child transmission
daily, almost entirely in the developing world. Even if a baby is
born free of HIV, there is still a 10 percent chance that an
infected mother could pass the virus to the child during breast
feeding.

World Cup: Brazil scared but wins 3-2 to reach semifinal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Scared by a Danish goal after only two
minutes, defending champion Brazil downed the upstart 3-2 Friday to
reach the semifinal of the World Cup.
	   Ronaldo set up goals for Bebeto and Rivaldo after Martin
Jorgensen surprised the four-time titlist with an early goal for
the outsiders.
	   A blunder by Roberto Carlos gave Brian Laudrup an equalizer
early in the second half but Rivaldo fired home a 25-meter drive in
the 61st to clinch a victory for the four-time titlist.
	   The Danes could even have snatched a 3-3 tie but Laudrup shot
wide from close range and Marc Rieper headed against the bar two
minutes from the end.
	   The Danes, who netted two early goals in a 4-1 victory over
Olympic champion Nigeria in the previous round, were at it again
against the world titlists.
	   After Dunga had fouled Peter Moller just outside the area, they
took the free kick quickly and Brian Laudrup slipped free down the
left. With the Brazilian defense slow to see the danger, he pulled
the ball back to the unmarked Jorgensen who fired first time past
Taffarel from 12 meters (yards) with his left foot.
	   The Brazilians were level in the 11th minute when Ronaldo, on
the halfway line, turned to send a ball through for Bebeto to run
for goal. A veteran of Brazil's 1994 triumph, Bebeto outpaced
Danish marker Thomas Helveg and ran 30 meters before sliding the
ball past 'keeper Peter Schmeichel for his third goal of the
championship.
	   Back on level terms, the Brazilians managed to slow down the
fast pace of the game before striking again in the 26th minute.
	   The Danes were punished for losing possession 30 meters from
their own goal and Ronaldo wasted no time in feeding the ball to
Rivaldo. The Barcelona midfielder had Bebeto alongside as they ran
clear of the defense but needed no help as he drove the ball under
Schmeichel's body with an angled left-foot shot.
	   After surviving a long spell of Brazilian pressure, the Danes
had a chance to level in the 35th minute when the ball found the
unmarked Moller just outside the Brazilian area. Moller failed to
control the ball first time and, when he eventually fired at goal,
the shot was straight at Taffarel.
	   Ronaldo almost made it 3-1 four minutes before half time when he
was unchallenged at the far post and headed Dunga's free kick wide.
	   The Danes sent on Stig Tofting as a second half substitute and
the Duisburg moved into a good shooting position four minutes into
the second half but fired high and wide from 20 meters.
	   But the Brazilians handed Denmark an equalizer two minutes
later.
	   Roberto Carlos, facing his own goal, opted for a spectacular
overhead clearance but barely made contact. Instead of flying
upfield, the ball bobbled straight to the grateful Brian Laudrup
who fired it past Taffarel from 12 meters.
	   Stunned by that goal, the Brazilians hit back and regained the
lead in the 61st minute although it was a strike that came with the
Danish defense in no real danger.
	   Rivaldo collected the ball 35 meters from goal and in plenty of
space. With the defense retreating to cover Ronaldo and Bebeto, the
Barcelona forward decided to shoot from 25 and fired a low
left-footer past Schmeichel and inside the right hand post.
	   It should have been 3-3 with 12 minutes remaining when Helveg
got behind the Brazilian defense and pulled the ball back to Brian
Laudrup who side-footed wide from right in front of goal.
	   Two minutes from the end, the Brazilians were almost caught out
again when a right wing cross found Rieper unmarked and his header
struck the top of the crossbar.
	   Lineups:
	   Brazil _ Taffarel; Cafu, Junior Baiano, Aldair, Roberto Carlos;
Dunga, Cesar Sampaio, Leonardo (Emerson, 72nd), Rivaldo (Ze
Roberto, 87th); Ronaldo, Bebeto (Denilson, 64th).
	   Denmark _ Peter Schmeichel: Marc Rieper, Jes Hogh, Jan Heintze,
Soren Colding, Thomas Helveg (Michael Schjonberg, 87th), Allan
Nielsen (Stig Tofting, 46th), Martin Jorgensen, Michael Laudrup;

Brazil suspends sales of all products made by German drug company
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The government on Friday suspended
sales of all products made by German pharmaceutical giant Schering
AG's local subsidiary, whose phony birth control pills are blamed
for several unwanted pregnancies.
	   The suspension by the Health Ministry came two days after
Schering was slapped with a dlrs 2.5 million fine, following
reports by at least 10 women that they became pregnant after taking
Microvlar contraceptives manufactured by Schering.
	   Schering said the bogus pills were intended solely to test new
packaging equipment. The placebo tablets, made of lactose and
sugar, were supposed to have been incinerated after the tests, but
were stolen and sold illegally.
	   Schering can produce but not sell its other products, including
medicine for cancer and hormonal disorders, until authorities
conduct a new inspection of its facilities, the Health Ministry
said.
	   Production of Microvlar has been stopped and will only resume
after Schering recalls all of its packages from drug stores and
changes its packaging format.
	   The new inspection, which has not been scheduled, will determine
if Schering has corrected several irregularities that health
officials detected earlier at the company's Sao Paulo facilities.
	   According to the Health Ministry, the equipment used to package
bogus and genuine contraceptives was in the same room. Inspectors
also detected a ``lack of rigorous control over the placebos that
left the plant to be incinerated,'' and the fact that the packages
of fake pills were not identified as such.
	   The ministry said 625,000 packages containing 21 placebos each
reached the market.
	   Schering has also been scolded for taking nearly a month to
notify authorities after receiving an anonymous letter with a
package of the fake pills in May.
	   Rainer Bitzer, president of Schering's Brazilian subsidiary,
said the company first conducted its own investigation and found no
placebos on the market.
	   ``Only after the first pregnant woman called to complain did we
realize the problem was bigger than we had imagined,'' Bitzer said
in an interview with the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper. ``We made a
mistake in not notifying authorities immediately.''
	   Schering attorney Cid Scartezzini said the company has started
contacting the pregnant women to conduct a case-by-case study to
determine ``how we will help them.''

Goran keeps his cool, beats Krajicek in marathon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVEN WINE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Goran Ivanisevic kept his muttering to
a minimum. He didn't argue with the chair umpire, and he waited
until the match ended to throw his racket.
	   In short, the quick-tempered Croatian wasn't himself, and that's
why he won.
	   Keeping his poise even after blowing a big lead, Ivanisevic
advanced to his third Wimbledon final Friday, outlasting 1996
champion Richard Krajicek 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-7 (7-5), 15-13.
	   Ivanisevic, a runnerup in 1992 and 1994, will play four-time
champ Pete Sampras in Sunday's final.
	   ``This year I have the best chance,'' Ivanisevic said. ``I would
be very disappointed if I don't do it.''
	   Ivanisevic, long considered the most talented active player
without a Grand Slam title, has always been quick to unravel under
pressure. He came into the tournament ranked 25th, with just one
match victory in the past five majors.
	   But Ivanisevic, 26, has shown a newfound maturity during the
fortnight, suffering only one ``blackout,'' as he termed it. And
Friday's match really tested his temper.
	   Ivanisevic squandered a pair of match points in the fourth set
when he missed an ace by an inch and then double-faulted. But even
after losing the set, he somehow kept his cool.
	   ``That's strange, you know?'' he admitted. ``But I think, `If I
lose it for just a second, I will lose the match.'
	   ``I don't think anybody bet on me when I lost the fourth set.
Everybody said, `It's going to be 6-2, maybe 6-3. He's gone. He's
going to lose it.' But I did win.'''
	   The match featured two of the game's biggest servers, and
Krajicek was in top form with 42 aces _ 23 in the final set _ and
just five double-faults. Ivanisevic had a more modest 28 aces and
16 double-faults, but he compensated with outstanding play at the
net, including several acrobatic volleys on crucial points.
	   The most dramatic moment came with Ivanisevic holding two match
points at 5-4, 40-15 in the fourth set. He slammed a serve beyond
the reach of Krajicek, who thought he had lost and started toward
the net to congratulate his opponent.
	   Then came a surprising word from the chair umpire: ``Let!'' He
ruled the serve had ticked the net, and the apparent ace didn't
count.
	   Ivanisevic looked at the sky, smiled and declined to protest.
Krajicek laughed, extended his right arm to feign a handshake and
sighed in relief.
	   ``I already was walking to the net,'' the Dutchman said. ``I
didn't hear the net cord. I thought the match was over.''
	   Krajicek went on to win the game, earning a reprieve that lasted
88 minutes and forced another 31 games. But in the end, the verdict
remained the same, even after Ivanisevic fell behind a service
break at 3-2 in the final set.
	   He immediately broke back, and then the match became a test of
nerves. There were no break points in the next 21 games, but
Ivanisevic remained patient.
	   ``I was just mentally very strong,'' he said. ``I just believed
I was going to win.''
	   He had the advantage of serving first in the final set, which
meant that in the late stages of the match, Krajicek was always
serving from behind.
	   In the 73rd game, he cracked. Two poor volleys made the score
0-30, and a backhand winner from Ivanisevic made it 15-40. Then, on
match point, after three hours and 22 minutes, Krajicek dumped
another volley into the net.
	   Ivanisevic fell to his knees, tapped the ground with his fists
and gleefully yanked off his bandana. Then he gave in to the
impulse he had kept in check all day, and his racket went flying
into the stands.

French edges into semifinal after penalty shootout victory over

	   PARIS (AP) _ Defending champion Brazil survived a fright by
outsider Denmark and host France needed a penalty shootout victory
over Italy to gain the World Cup semifinals Friday.
	   The Danes took a second minute lead against the Brazilians
before losing 3-2 to the four-time titlists for whom Rivaldo scored
twice and Ronaldo set up two of the goals.
	   In marked contrast to the five-goal thriller at Nantes, host
France squeezed into the semifinal when it edged Italy 4-3 on
penalties after a tense, goalless draw at the Stade de France.
	   Martin Jorgensen's early goal for the Danes at La Beaujoire
stadium on a pass from Brian Laudrup stung the champions who hit
back with first half strikes by Bebeto and Rivaldo, both set up by
passes from Ronaldo.
	   A blunder by Roberto Carlos, who made an embarrassing mess of an
acrobatic overhead clearance in front of his own goal, gave Laudrup
an equalizer early in the second half. But Rivaldo fired home a
25-meter drive in the 61st to clinch a victory for the four-time
titlist.
	   The Danes could even have snatched a 3-3 tie but Laudrup shot
wide from close range and Marc Rieper headed against the bar two
minutes from the end.
	   After 120 minutes of tedious, error-filled play that had few
goal chances, France and Italy went into a penalty shootout at the
Stade de France and the score was 3-3 before defender Laurent Blanc
stepped up for the French.
	   Blanc, whose extra-time goal against Paraguay put France into
the quarterfinals against the Italians, fired the ball past Italian
keeper Gianluca Pagliuca to give his team the edge.
	   Luigi Di Biagio was next up for Italy and the shaven-headed
midfielder, who has had a standout tournament, hit the bar with his
attempt.
	   As the French players celebrated, Di Biagio was distraught as
his colleagues tried to console him.
	   It was the third time in a row the Italians had lost in the
World Cup on a penalty shootout. The last time was the 1994 final
against Brazil, losing 3-2 in a shootout when Roberto Baggio fired
over the bar. That also was after a 0-0 draw.
	   In 1990 Argentina edged the Italians 4-3 on penalties in the
semifinal after a 1-1 tie.
	   ``It's a sort of a curse,'' Italy's coach, Cesare Maldini, said.
	   ``We're walking out of this stadium with our heads up. It's a
pity because it really is a lottery when you go to a shootout.
	   ``I can't fault any of my players, they gave it all,'' the
Italian coach said. ``The team played really well.''
	   Despite the fact that his team has scraped through its last two
games with narrow victories, French coach Aime Jacquet believes it
is capable of winning the World Cup.
	   ``We have the players and the spirit now to go all the way and
take the title,'' he said.
	   ``It was a very difficult match. But we managed to stick to our
game plan and France really deserved to win. We kept our nerve in
the penalty shoot-out.''
	   The other two quarterfinals are Saturday, with Argentina facing
the Netherlands at Marseille with Brazil meeting the winner in the
semifinal and Germany meeting debutant Croatia at Lyon to decide
who faces the French.
	   Argentina coach Daniel Passarella is considering changes to his
lineup after the team scrambled into the last eight on the back of
a penalty shootout victory over England.
	   Defender Roberto Sensini is expected to be back anyway after
missing two games due to injury, but Passarella may shakeup his
front line, possibly starting Roma's 30-year-old forward Abel Balbo
as Gabriel Batistuta's partner instead of Claudio Lopez.
	   ``The Netherlands is a great team, with players with tremendous
technical skills,'' Argentina midfielder and team captain Diego
Simeone said Friday. ``We will try to take the midfield from them,
it's there because where they are especially strong.''
	   German coach Berti Vogts is celebrating his 100th game in charge
and his players want to give him the ideal present of a place in
the semifinals.
	   ``I really want to win this game, not because it's my 100th, but
because my team deserves it,'' Vogts said. They have worked so
hard.''

Mexican stocks, peso close higher in light trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican stocks and the peso closed higher
Friday despite low trading volume as a result of the U.S.
Independence Day holiday.
	   The key IPC index closed up 1.2 percent or 51.95 points at
4,483.75 points. At the end of 1997, the IPC stood at 5,229.35.
	   A volume of 23.7 million shares was traded worth 436.5 million
pesos compared to Thursday's volume of 63.4 million shares worth
938.8 million.
	   Only 9.1 million shares were traded on the last U.S. holiday,
Memorial Day, on May 25.
	   The peso also closed stronger Friday in very slow trading.
	   On 48-hour spot markets in Mexico City, banking leader Banamex
quoted the peso closing at a midrate of 8.9360 against the U.S.
dollar, stronger from both its open of 8.9410 and stronger from its
close of 8.9600 Thursday.
	   Friday is a holiday in the U.S. because July 4 or Independence
Day falls on Saturday this year. As a result, there was no peso
futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Junta names new No. 2 man in Nigeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The Nigerian junta named a new chief of
general staff Friday to replace the general who had previously held
what is effectively the country's No. 2 position _ but was
sentenced to death for allegedly plotting a coup.
	   Gen. Oladipyo Diya, once the right-hand man to Nigeria's late
dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, was sentenced to death in April along
with five other people for the alleged December plot.
	   On Friday, Rear Adm. Mike Akhigbe, the chief of naval staff, was
named to replace Diya. Akhigbe notably is a Christian from southern
Nigeria, promoted in a military that is overwhelmingly made up of
Muslim Northerners.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, who came to power last month after
Abacha's death, has moved to distance himself from his
predecessor's harsh policies, and the appointment across ethnic and
religious lines may reflect his willingness to reach out beyond
Abacha's core military constituency.
	   However, it may also indicate that Nigeria's military intends to
remain in power beyond Oct. 1, the date the country is supposed to
be returned to civilian rule.
	   The transition schedule was created by Abacha, but Abubakar has
vowed to proceed with it.
	   The junta has yet to say whether it will carry out the death
sentence handed down against Diya.

Brazil suspends sales of all products made by German drug company
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Schering statement. PICKS UP 7th

 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The government on Friday suspended
sales of all products made by German pharmaceutical giant Schering
AG's local subsidiary, whose phony birth control pills caused
several unwanted pregnancies.
	   The suspension by the Health Ministry came two days after
Schering was slapped with a dlrs 2.5 million fine, following
reports by at least 10 women that they became pregnant after taking
fake Microvlar contraceptives manufactured by Schering.
	   Schering said the bogus pills were intended solely to test new
packaging equipment. The placebo tablets, made of lactose and
sugar, were supposed to have been incinerated after the tests, but
were stolen and sold illegally.
	   Schering on Friday resumed production of all its products except
Microvlar, following a weeklong interdiction ordered by the
government.
	   But the company is still prohibited from selling any of its
products, including medicine for cancer and hormonal disorders,
until authorities conduct a new inspection of its facilities, the
Health Ministry said.
	   In a statement released Friday evening, Schering expressed its
``concern that these medicines will not be made available to
patients, hospitals and drug stores that need them.''
	   Production of Microvlar will only resume after Schering recalls
all of its packages from drug stores and changes its packaging
format.
	   Schering said in its note that approximately 900,000 Microvlar
packages have already been withdrawn from drug stores throughout
the country. It did not say if any of these packages contained
placebos.
	   The new inspection, 7th graf pvs.

Clinton ends 9-day China trip, sees democracy for Chinese
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout, TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton bid farewell to
China on the eve of America's Independence Day, saying he believes
democracy will come to the communist giant. He praised President
Jiang Zemin as a visionary _ ``the right leadership at the right
time.''
	   Clinton said Jiang and Premier Zhu Rongji _ who is dismantling
massive state-run industries _ should ``ride the wave of change and
take China fully into the 21st century and basically dismantle the
resistance to it.''
	   Clinton's nine-day China journey was the first by an American
president since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. At a
concluding news conference, he said there had been a remarkable
transformation in the world's most populous nation but there was
``distance still to be traveled.''
	   After stops in five cities and plenty of shopping opportunities,
the cargo holds of Air Force One and the accompanying press charter
were bulging with silks, oriental art, vases and rugs. The trip was
good business for China _ even if Clinton said he was disappointed
by the lack of progress toward lowering China's trade barriers to
American imports.
	   The president and his family were arriving back home before dawn
on July Fourth.
	   In a minor mishap before he left Hong Kong, Clinton and his wife
Hillary were stuck on an elevator for 10 minutes after a lightning
bolt caused a power surge that knocked out a computer at the
convention center. Finally, the elevator doors were pried open and
they walked out, cracking jokes about the delay, an aide said.
	   Concluding his trip to a country that his national security
adviser had said was ruled by an authoritarian government, Clinton
said, ``I believe there can be and I believe there will be''
democracy in China. Asked if it might happen in his lifetime, the
president said, ``I certainly hope so.''
	   Asked when, Clinton said, ``That's like saying ... do I believe
a woman will be elected president of the United States? I do. Do I
think it will be a good thing? I do. Do I know when it will happen?
I don't.''
	   Clinton spoke warmly about Jiang, the onetime electrical
engineer who climbed the ranks from relative obscurity in Shanghai
to be chosen as Deng Xiaoping's successor. Clinton said Jiang, once
regarded as a transitional figure, probably will lead China for
many years.
	   ``He's a man of extraordinary intellect, very high energy, a lot
of vigor for his age or indeed for any age,'' Clinton said.
Further, he said Jiang has imagination and vision and that his
partner, Zhu, is ``very able.''
	   ``So I believe that there's a very good chance that China has
the right leadership at the right time and that they understand the
daunting, massive nature of the challenges they face,'' Clinton
said.
	   After causing anxiety in Taiwan and sparking criticism at home
with a personal statement about U.S. policy toward Tapei, Clinton
said he had not altered America's position.
	   But he acknowledged that his statement _ declaring the United
States does not support independence for Taiwan _ was ``obviously
something that the Chinese government agrees with.'' Critics said
the statement weakened Taiwan's hand in negotiations with Beijing,
which regards Taiwan as a renegade province.
	   Clinton said his travels from the largest cities to small
villages showed him the different faces of China _ a nation moving
into the world of cellular phones and the Internet.
	   ``Clearly, China is changing,'' the president said, ``but there
remain powerful forces resisting change, as evidenced by continuing
governmental restrictions on free speech, assembly and freedom of
worship.''
	   He said his uncensored appearances on Chinese television were a
sign of confidence by Jiang.
	   While some critics had urged him not to come to China, Clinton
said he still believes that the best approach for handling
differences is by ``dealing directly, forcefully, but respectfully,
with the Chinese about our values.''
	   Earlier in the day, he warned there was only so much the United
States could do to help Asia through its financial crisis. ``There
is a very limited time period in which we can absorb all the
exports to try to do our part to keep the Asian economy going,''
the president told business leaders.

Sampras goes for 5th Wimbledon title against Ivanisevic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; recasts throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVE WILSTEIN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Tennis Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Pete Sampras punched holes in a
British fantasy with the fastest serves at Wimbledon, and Goran
Ivanisevic curbed his stormy temper to win a ``horror thriller''
Friday and set up a second clash for the title.
	   Sampras, seeking to tie Bjorn Borg's Open-era men's mark of five
Wimbledon championships, crushed aces from 136 mph in the first set
to 134 mph on match point to take out England's Tim Henman, 6-3,
4-6, 7-5, 6-3.
	   Ivanisevic, a two-time finalist who lost to Sampras in the 1994
title match, outlasted 1996 champion Richard Krajicek in a
thunderous, 70-ace serving duel, 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-7 (7-5), 15-13.
	   ``You know he's going to hit his aces, he's going to hit his
double faults,'' Sampras said of the prospect of playing Ivanisevic
on Sunday. ``You're going to have to ride the wave with Goran.''
	   Ivanisevic is weary of hearing himself called the greatest
player who's never won a major title. He's joked about his wild
matches _ he served 37 aces in the 1992 Wimbledon final he lost to
Andre Agassi _ but he desperately wants to win this time.
	   ``I'm really keeping my mind well and believing I can do it this
year,'' said Ivanisevic, who flung his racket crosscourt and 12
rows up in the stands to celebrate his victory.
	   ``I think I have a good chance. He's going to be nervous like
me. He's going for the record. I'm going for my first one. We both
want to win badly. There's just maybe a slight advantage that he
knows how it is to feel that victory. He was holding this trophy
four times.''
	   On a wintry gray day of a tournament that had been bereft of
compelling men's matches, the two semifinals produced tennis of the
highest quality and were won by players who had been struggling
through their worst years.
	   Sampras, shut out of Grand Slam finals since he captured
Wimbledon last year, faced a player in the No. 12 Henman who is at
his best on grass and who had the Centre Court crowd roaring for
him on every point. No British man had won Wimbledon since Fred
Perry in 1936, and Henman came into this match confident that he
could break the jinx.
	   British fans bought into that fantasy, backing Henman at the
betting parlors, and the nation looked to him to soothe its wounded
pride over England's loss this week in the World Cup. The stakes
gave the match the aura of a heavyweight title fight.
	   ``Not only was I battling Tim, the crowd was very tough,'' said
Sampras, who looked edgy and tense throughout the match, arguing
with the umpire more than usual and tossing a cracked racket high
into the stands.
	   ``I was very intense, and you have to be at this level and at
this stage in the tournament. ... Obviously I was going to show a
little more emotion than usual.''
	   Sampras' game is built around his serve, and in the first set he
came close to perfection as he held three times at love and
delivered a 136 mph ace that was faster than Ivanisevic's previous
best of the tournament, 133 mph.
	   But it was not all power. Sampras, who practices often with
Henman and occasionally plays doubles with him, returned well and
finessed his way to breaks in the seventh and ninth games of the
set as he strung together four straight winning games.
	   Henman finally found ways to pressure Sampras with angled
returns and passes as he broke him twice for a 4-1 lead in the
second set and went on to tie the match at a set apiece.
	   ``I dug my heels in a little bit, created some opportunities,
hit some good good returns at 1-1, and got ahead,'' Henman said.
``That obviously gave me a lot of confidence, and I built on that.
A set all, going with serve in the third, it's anyone's match. But
at 5-6, he was the one who came up with the goods.''
	   The goods Sampras produced virtually gave him the match. With
Henman serving at 30-30, Sampras sprang a few feet into the air for
an overhead smash that bounced into the stands for the first of
three set points. Henman survived the first two but not the third,
which Sampras notched with a brilliant backhand volley crosscourt.
Sampras followed that up with a blistering backhand crosscourt pass
that Henman barely reached.
	   It was the only break of the third set, and Sampras leaped to
celebrate.
	   ``When I won the third set, I knew I had him,'' Sampras said.
	   The fans kept hoping for a miracle, but Henman was at Sampras'
mercy. As well as the 23-year-old from Oxford played, Sampras
played better. Serving to close out the match, Sampras showed he
wasn't the least bit weary as he whacked a 133 mph ace for 40-0
and, two points later, a 134 mph ace, his 16th, for the match.
	   ``I can't say enough good things about Tim's game,'' Sampras
said. ``He's a very, very solid player and will eventually win this
tournament one year.''
	   Maybe. Though probably not as long as Sampras is playing.
	   Ivanisevic will have his third shot at the title, and second
with Sampras on the other side. That prospect is somewhat
surprising in view of Ivanisevic's recent history: He won only one
match in his previous five Grand Slam events.
	   ``A lot of people say, `He's gone, he's never going to be back,'
and, you know, you have two ears and you have to listen all the
time,'' the Croatian said. ``But I knew that I had a bad six
months, and Wimbledon came at the right time. I was practicing hard
for the last one month, trying to not feel sorry for myself and
keep working. I think this is the time it's going to pay off for
me.''
	   Ivanisevic squandered two match points in the fourth set, then
outlasted Krajicek, who finished with 42 aces. The final set lasted
one hour, 19 minutes.
	   ``The fifth set was a just a horror thriller,'' he said. ``I
never saw somebody serving like that in my life. They were just
bombs. I couldn't even react. I said, `Just keep your serve. He has
to miss a couple of first serves.' And that happened at 13-14.''
	   The most surprising aspect of Ivanisevic's victory was how he
didn't lose his temper or his composure after missing the two match
points in the fourth set and going down a break in the fifth.
	   ``I don't think anybody bet on me when I lost the fourth set,''
he said. ``People thought, `he's gone, he's going to lose it.' ...
I was just mentally very strong today. Never like this in my life.
I just believed I was going to win it.''

Leader of tiny Nevis finds niche in Small Islands conference
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUSAN LINNEE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LE REDUIT, Mauritius (AP) _ The prime minister of Nevis came
halfway around the world to explain to an international conference
on small islands why he wants to make his Caribbean country even
smaller.
	   Vance Amory wants to break Nevis free from the federation it
formed with island of St. Kitts after their independence from
Britain in 1983. His government plans to hold a referendum among
the 10,000 inhabitants of his 93-square-kilometer (36-square-mile)
island in the next three months.
	   The International Small Islands Studies Association has no say
in whether Amory succeeds. But many members of the group _ a
laid-back crowd of scholars, researchers and island-lovers meeting
this weekend on the western Indian Ocean island of Mauritius _ are
intrigued by a small, vulnerable island trying to go it alone.
	   ``I don't think the issue of a small base or a small area should
be the prescribing issue of whether a country should be sovereign
but whether it can sustain itself,'' Amory told the conference.
	   Sustainable development is a key concern of participants who
came to the conference from 28 nations and islands around the
world.
	   That doesn't appear to be a problem for Nevis. It has
established an off-shore financial operation and does well in
upmarket tourism, providing 38 percent of tax revenue for its
federation with St. Kitts, two miles away. But Amory says the
federation spends only 21 percent of its budget on Nevis.
	   Economist Robert Read of England's Lancaster University said
that despite its small size, Nevis would be in much better shape
than countries like the former Soviet republics that have had to
create their economies and institutions from scratch.
	   The ISISA, which has no governmental or official affiliation,
has about 100 members but no physical headquarters. It was formed
in 1994.

World Cup: Brazil scared but wins 3-2 to reach semifinal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Scared by a Danish goal after only two
minutes, defending champion Brazil downed the upstart 3-2 Friday to
reach the semifinal of the World Cup.
	   Ronaldo set up goals for Bebeto and Rivaldo after Martin
Jorgensen surprised the four-time titlist with an early goal for
the outsiders.
	   A blunder by Roberto Carlos gave Brian Laudrup an equalizer
early in the second half but Rivaldo fired home a 25-meter drive in
the 61st for his second of the game to clinch victory.
	   The Danes could even have snatched a 3-3 tie but Laudrup shot
wide from close range and Marc Rieper headed against the bar two
minutes from the end.
	   ``I am very proud of my players' performance,'' said Denmark's
Swedish coach, Bo Johansson. ``It was almost as good as the best
team in the world. All credit to them. I didn't realise they were
quite that good.
	   ``I really think we played a world class game. But we could not
ensure we did not lose, and that's the way it goes.''
	   Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo, sometimes the team's sternest
critic, applauded the performance of his players, particularly
Ronaldo.
	   ``This was the victory of courage,'' he said. ``This was a true
World Cup game, beautiful, frank and open. All games should be like
this.
	   ``Ronaldo showed that is he is not only goals,'' Zagallo said.
``His two plays were spectacular.''
	   Brazilian defender Cafu, who will miss the semifinal after
collecting his second yellow card of the championship,
	   ``It was the spirit of our game which saw us through,'' the Roma
defender said. ``We are always running for the ball.
	   ``I think we really deserved it. We managed to master the game
completely in the end so I think it would have been unfair for us
not to qualify.''
	   The Danes, who netted two early goals in a 4-1 victory over
Olympic champion Nigeria in the previous round, were at it again
against the world titlists.
	   After Dunga had fouled Peter Moller just outside the area, they
took the free kick quickly and Brian Laudrup slipped free down the
left. With the Brazilian defense slow to see the danger, he pulled
the ball back to the unmarked Jorgensen who fired first time past
Taffarel from 12 meters (yards) with his left foot.
	   The Brazilians were level in the 11th minute when Ronaldo, on
the halfway line, turned to send a ball through for Bebeto to run
for goal. A veteran of Brazil's 1994 triumph, Bebeto outpaced
Danish marker Thomas Helveg and ran 30 meters before sliding the
ball past 'keeper Peter Schmeichel for his third goal of the
championship.
	   Back on level terms, the Brazilians managed to slow down the
fast pace of the game before striking again in the 26th minute.
	   The Danes were punished for losing possession 30 meters from
their own goal and Ronaldo wasted no time in feeding the ball to
Rivaldo. The Barcelona midfielder had Bebeto alongside as they ran
clear of the defense but needed no help as he drove the ball under
Schmeichel's body with an angled left-foot shot.
	   The Brazilians handed Denmark an equalizer six minutes into the
second half.
	   Roberto Carlos, facing his own goal, opted for a spectacular
overhead clearance but barely made contact. Instead of flying
upfield, the ball bobbled straight to the grateful Brian Laudrup
who fired it past Taffarel from 12 meters.
	   Stunned by that goal, the Brazilians hit back and regained the
lead in the 61st minute although it was a strike that came with the
Danish defense in no real danger.
	   Rivaldo collected the ball 35 meters from goal and in plenty of
space. With the defense retreating to cover Ronaldo and Bebeto, the
Barcelona forward decided to shoot from 25 and fired a low
left-footer past Schmeichel and inside the right hand post.
	   It should have been 3-3 with 12 minutes remaining when Helveg
got behind the Brazilian defense and pulled the ball back to Brian
Laudrup who side-footed wide from right in front of goal.
	   Two minutes from the end, the Brazilians were almost caught out
again when a right wing cross found Rieper unmarked and his header
struck the top of the crossbar.
	   Lineups:
	   Brazil _ Taffarel; Cafu, Junior Baiano, Aldair, Roberto Carlos;
Dunga, Cesar Sampaio, Leonardo (Emerson, 72nd), Rivaldo (Ze
Roberto, 87th); Ronaldo, Bebeto (Denilson, 64th).
	   Denmark _ Peter Schmeichel: Marc Rieper, Jes Hogh, Jan Heintze,
Soren Colding, Thomas Helveg (Michael Schjonberg, 87th), Allan
Nielsen (Stig Tofting, 46th), Martin Jorgensen, Michael Laudrup;
Brian Laudrup, Peter Moller (Ebbe Sand, 67th).

Colombia hostage release could help spur difficult peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Calling it a peace gesture, Colombia's
second-largest guerrilla group on Friday released 15 young female
hostages accused by the rebels of being army spies disguised as
good samaritans.
	   Rebels of the National Liberation Army, known by its spanish
initials ELN, delivered the women to a civilian commission that
included Nobel laureate and East Timor human rights activist Jose
Ramos-Horta, who has nominated Colombia's children for the 1998
peace prize.
	   Their release comes amid a flurry of initiatives that have
heightened hopes for peace in Colombia's 34-year civil war. The
women had been held in mountain hideouts since June 15.
	   ``They're free,'' Presidential Peace Commissioner Jose Noe Rios
told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Friday from the
scene of the handover in the northern Segovia region, about 175
miles (280 kms) north of Bogota.
	   The army insists the women who participate in an army civic
action program called ``the girls of steel'' go uniformed but
unarmed, delivering food and giving vaccinations in poor villages
where the rebels have sought influence.
	   The rebels say the community work was a cover for espionage.
	   In radio interviews after their release, several of the women,
nine of whom were minors, said they were treated well by the
rebels.
	   One woman interviewed said the entire group would quit the
program that brought them under rebel suspicion.
	   ``If we put the uniforms back on and go out with the soldiers,
they will declare us military objectives,'' said one women
interviewed on Radionet radio, and who could not be identified
under Colombian law because she was a minor.
	   The ELN announced Monday it agreed to meetings with Colombian
political, social and business leaders beginning July 12 in Germany
that could lead to direct peace talks with the incoming government
of President-elect Andres Pastrana.
	   The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the largest rebel
group, has said it, too, will talk peace with Pastrana, who was
elected June 21 and takes office August 7.
	   Negotiations stagnated under outgoing President Ernest Samper,
whose goverment saw a dirty war expand as rebels gained strength
against a demoralized army and right-wing paramilitary groups
flourished, committing dozens of massacres of suspected guerrillas.
	   Nobel-winning author Gabriel Garcia-Marquez declined an
invitation to the talks, but called them a ``first big step''
toward peace.
	   However war's end will be a long way off, political leaders and
analysts caution.
	   ``One shouldn't create false expectations because peace cannot
be obtained from one day to the next,'' Pastrana said Wednesday.
	   The first step is to get a genuine negotiation under way, said
Ernesto Borda, a political analyst from the Javeriana University.
	   ``The peace process can begin now, but it could go on for 10
years,'' he said.
	   A key stumbling block will be the presence of the paramilitary
groups. Leftist rebels have demanded they be dissolved as a
precondition for negotiations, but paramilitary leaders say they
won't disarm until the rebels have.
	   Negotiations may also have to tackle Colombia's role as the
world's main supplier of cocaine. Both leftist rebels and
paramilitary groups are heavily financed by drug traffickers who
receive protection in return.
	   ``Who's interested having the war continue?,'' says Borda. ``The
drug traffickers.''

Danes can live with losing to the world's best

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Living up to their affable
reputation, Danish soccer fans were cheerful on Friday even though
their team lost a World Cup quarterfinal game to Brazil.
	   ``I bought these fireworks for a Danish win. We lost. I'll fire
them off anyway,'' said Johannes Petersen, one of the approximately
100,000 people who gathered in Copenhagen's main square to watch
the game on a giant television screen.
	   ``Well done Brazil. You deserve this,'' he shouted as he lit the
fireworks.
	   The Danish team surprised many by making it so far in the World
Cup and put up an impressive battle against formidable Brazil,
which won 3-2.
	   ``We lost ...so what ? It was the World Cup's best game,'' said
fan Finn Klit. ``It was an artistic goodbye.''
	   ``Of course it's sad that we lost but it's great to lose the
world's best team,'' said Peter Kristensen, a father with his
5-year-old son Sebastian on his shoulders.
	   Although bositerous and beer-loving, Danish fans have earned the
nickname ``roligans'' _ combining the Danish word for orderly with
hooligan _ for their good spirits and sense of decency.
	   No violence was reported on Friday night, even though emotions
were high. The spectators freuqnetly covered their
red-and-white-painted faces in dismay when Brazil led an attack.
	   The company that runs the ferries between Copenhagen and the
southern Swedish city of Malmoe, said its boats were filled to
capacity Friday because many Swedes wanted to see the game. Sweden
didn't qualify for the World Cup.

World Cup: Brazilians heave a sigh of relief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilians heaved a sigh of relief
Friday after the defending champion edged Denmark 3-2 and advanced
to the semifinals of the World Cup.
	   In Niteroi, across the bay from Rio, some 2,000 gathered before
a large television screen on Icarai beach.
	   When Denmark scored the first goal less than two minutes after
the opening kickoff, Brazilians looked on in shock and disbelief.
	   A somber mood hovered over the crowd until Bebeto's goal in the
11th minute and then the crowd let loose, celebrating with samba
and fireworks.
	   ``We have the best players in the world, but we have a lousy
team,'' said Joao Malta, a stock broker who left work early to
watch the game.
	   Sloppy play by Brazil kept the fans on edge as Brazil took the
lead only to see Denmark tie it up again.
	   Even when Brazil scored to lead 3-2, Denmark took advantage of
gaping holes in the Brazilian defense and created chacnes that left
the crowd uneasy.
	   ``We're going to have to play better than that if we want to win
the Cup,'' said Selma Viera, who was selling Brazilian flags and
plastic noise makers.
	   Only when the referee blew the final whistle did the crowd let
loose and begin celebrating in earnest.

Sloppy Brazil edges past Denmark into Cup semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Optional, recasts, adds color &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ They were sloppy, uneven and looked most
unlike world champions. But in the end, Brazil was just, barely too
big for Denmark's giant-killers.
	   With a pair of goals from Rivaldo and with Ronaldo in a new role
as playmaker, Brazil edged past Denmark 3-2 on Friday and into the
Cup semifinals against Argentina or the Netherlands.
	   It shouldn't have been so difficult. But the Brazilian defense
fell apart against a plucky and carefree Danish team that was happy
just to reach the quarterfinals for the first time ever having
outplayed Olympic champion Nigeria 4-1 in the previous round.
	   The Danes, with nothing to lose, pushed the Brazilians into
showing glimmers of their awesome offensive potential, to the
delight of 40,000 fans at Beaujoire stadium. But they came up just
short.
	   Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo admitted to some heart-stopping
moments but said he enjoyed the game too.
	   ``Today, I'm really tired. It's too much tension,'' he said.
	   ``This was the victory of courage. This was a true World Cup
game, beautiful, frank and open. All games should be like this.
	   ``Ronaldo showed that is he is not only goals,'' Zagallo said.
``His two plays were spectacular.''
	   Denmark's coach applauded his team's showing against the world
champion.
	   ``I am very proud of my players' performance,'' he said. ``It
was almost as good as the best team in the world. All credit to
them. I didn't realise they were quite that good.
	   ``I really think we played a world class game,'' Johansson said.
``But we could not ensure we did not lose, and that's the way it
goes.''
	   Still, they drew first blood, in the first of many plays that
sent Zagallo's blood pressure to the stratosphere.
	   The game wasn't two minutes old when Dunga tripped Danish
striker Peter Moller at the left of the penalty area. While the
Brazilians were still setting up, Brian Laudrup took the tap, broke
in and passed back to Martin Jorgensen for an easy shot and a 1-0
lead.
	   The goal woke up the the Brazilians, who had been hearing all
week about the Danes' talent for upsets _ especially after they
routed favored Nigeria 4-1 in the previous round.
	   The upset seemed to fade in the 11th minute, when Ronaldo found
Bebeto streaking up the middle alone and sent him away with a
pinpoint pass. The 1994 Cup veteran sent his shot into the lower
left corner to make it 1-1.
	   Egyptian referee Gamal Ghandour had a busy and difficult night.
The first yellow card came out in the 12th minute, when Roberto
Carlos had a dust-up with Brian Laudrup. Eight minutes later Thomas
Helveg was booked for tripping Roberto Carlos.
	   But a vicious tackle on Ronaldo didn't even get a whistle, as
the irate Brazilian fans chanted insults in Portuguese.
	   Brazil kept the pressure on, charging up the flanks, and in the
26th minute Ronaldo found Rivaldo on the left side. His chip shot
over goalie Peter Schmeichel made it 2-1, and the tone of the game
seemed to be set.
	   But Brazil's porous defense would make it a thriller. In the
36th minute, Moller was alone in the penalty area. But he stepped
on the ball, giving Taffarel time to recover.
	   In the 37th minute, Aldair hacked Thomas Helveg and drew a
yellow card, and two minutes later it was Soren Colding who got
carded for fouling Roberto Carlos with a forearm to his neck.
	   Stig Tofting replaced Allan Nielsen for Denmark at the start of
the second half.
	   The Brazilian defense almost gave Zagallo heart failure again in
the 51st minute, when Roberto Carlos tried to clear a loose ball
from his own penalty area with a bicycle kick and missed
everything. The ball dropped at the feet of Brian Laudrup, who
fired into the upper corner to make it 2-2.
	   The goal gave the Danes morale, and they drew applause for some
nifty footwork in their own end. Jorgensen put a booming shot in
from the right side that curled just wide of the far post as
Taffarel stared.
	   Then Rivaldo took it on himself to set things straight. In the
61st minute, he picked up a ball in the midfield, raced up the left
side and unleashed a shot from 25 meters that found the far corner
to make it 3-2.
	   Three minutes later, Denilson came on for Bebeto, who went to
the bench with an icepack on his knee. Soon after Ebbe Sand
replaced Moller, and Emerson came on for Leonardo.
	   Denmark wasn't through. In the 78th minute, Helveg and Brian
Laudrup traded passes in the Brazilian penalty area, but Laudrup's
shot missed just wide. minutes later, Marc Rieper hit the crossbar
with a header.
	   Cafu and Ronaldo had chances in injury time as Denmark sent
everyone up, even the goalie, but Schmeichel got back in time to
cover.
	   Lineups:
	   Brazil _ Taffarel; Cafu, Junior Baiano, Aldair, Roberto Carlos;
Dunga, Cesar Sampaio, Leonardo (Emerson, 72nd), Rivaldo (Ze
Roberto, 87th); Ronaldo, Bebeto (Denilson, 64th).
	   Denmark _ Peter Schmeichel: Marc Rieper, Jes Hogh, Jan Heintze,

Nielsen (Stig Tofting, 46th), Martin Jorgensen, Michael Laudrup;
Brian Laudrup, Peter Moller (Ebbe Sand, 67th).

	   Weeklong talks sponsored by the U.N. Environment Program ended
Friday with participants agreeing to work on completing a treaty
within three years.
	   ``There is good consensus for the need to change,'' said John
Buccini, a Canadian official who served as chairman for the talks.
	   Public-interest groups monitoring the talks are worried that
developing countries may turn their backs on the treaty if they
don't get financial help to phase out some of the pesticides and
other chemicals on the target list.
	   But Jim Willis, director of the U.N. Environment Program's
chemicals division, said he didn't expect a serious rift between
developed and developing countries.
	   Buccini said he expects one of the hardest chemicals to ban will
be DDT, widely used in many developing countries to fight malaria.
It is among eight pesticides on the target list.
	   PCBs also are on the list, along with three byproducts of
chlorine-based industrial processes _ dioxins, furans and
hexachlorobenzene.
	   The chemicals can travel long distances and accumulate in human
bodies through food intake. They are passed from mother to unborn
children in the womb and to infants through breast milk.
	   They have been linked to cancer and neurological and
developmental problems.
	   UN officials expect five negotiating sessions in all, a pace
condemned by some conservationists as needlessly slow.
	   But Morag Simpson of Greenpeace Canada welcomed the start of
work toward a treaty after years of lobbying by environmentalists.
	   ``We've waited 10 years for this. To take just two and a half or
three years to negotiate these really important and critical issues
is actually not bad,'' she said.

Lopez plummets to worst Open round of career

<TEXT>
	   KOHLER, Wis. (AP) _ Nancy Lopez and playing partners Meg Mallon
and Jane Geddes approached the 18th green in the U.S. Women's Open
on Friday with white towels atop their outstretched putters.
	   ``Jane said we ought to walk up to 18 waving the white flag,''
Mallon said. ``That's pretty much how we felt. The course
definitely won.''
	   Blackwolf Run got the best of them _ and many others.
	   Kim Williams, who shared the first-round lead with Laura Davies
at 3-under-par, stumbled to a 10-over 81 for a two-day total of
149.
	   Not everybody had trouble Friday. Three-time Open winner Hollis
Stacy followed a 76 on Thursday with a 3-under 68 for 144, and
Dottie Pepper duplicated her 71 to reach the halfway point at even
par.
	   Davies, the 1987 Open champion, teed off in the afternoon, as
did Si Re Pak, Leslie Spalding and Pat Hurst, who were one stroke
back after one round.
	   Lightning caused a 51-minute delay, and most of the 150 golfers
were still on the course late in the afternoon.
	   But, with a 12-over-par 83 on Friday _ her worst round in 22
Women's Opens _ Lopez won't be making the cut.
	   The gallery at 18 cheered Lopez as though she were the leader.
	   ``The fans were fantastic. I never gave up, I just kept swinging
and hoping something would happen,'' Lopez said. ``It's just really
nice when you're playing bad, they're still there.''
	   Mallon shot a 76 for a two-day total of 12-over 153 and Geddes
finished with a 79 for 157.
	   With wind whipping off Lake Michigan and a few pins tucked
behind bunkers, they weren't the only ones whose second-day scores
soared on the unyielding 6,412-yard (5,861 meters), par-71 layout.
	   Some groups took three hours to play nine holes, and two
golfers, Candy Hanneman and Lisa Walters, were penalized two
strokes for slow play.
	   After 36 holes, the 60 lowest scorers and ties and anyone within
10 strokes of the lead will make the cut.
	   Lopez won't, after playing her worst of 81 career rounds in the
biggest event in women's golf. Her previous high score in an Open
was an 8-over 79 in the third round at Indianapolis in 1978.
	   Lopez, 41, languished through a two-day total of 18-over 160.
She has finished second in the Open four times, including last
year, when she lost by a shot to Alison Nicholas in a dramatic
finish at Pumpkin Ridge.
	   Displaying her usual graciousness, smile she did as the gallery
at 18 gave her a prolonged ovation, chanting ``Nancy! Nancy!'' just
like last year when she approached the final hole on Sunday with a
chance to win the only trophy in women's golf that has eluded her.
	   Now it will have to wait for another course, another year, if
ever.
	   Lopez said she was already looking forward to the Jamie Farr
Kroger Classic in Sylvania, Ohio, next week.
	   Lopez, who began the day at 6-over-par 77, misfired on the first
hole, hitting a woman fan in the face.
	   She parred the first four holes before running into a string of
bad luck that lasted an excruciating eight holes and more than two
hours.
	   From the fifth hole to the 12th, Lopez collected five bogeys and
three double bogeys. Her nightmarish run ended with a par on the
142-yard (130 meters)13th hole, by which time she was 20 strokes
off the lead.
	   She put her tee shot into the water on 18 for double bogey.
	   Williams had three bogeys and a double bogey on her first seven
holes on the Pete Dye-designed layout renowned for greens so fast
that men's two-time Open champion Ernie Els suggested the women
practice by putting in a bathtub.
	   Having never won in 12 years on the LPGA tour and playing with a
bad back that forced her to wear a brace and even recline on some
of the tees, Williams' early success was as surprising as Lopez's
lasting frustration.
	   Karen Noble got the second round off to a big start when she
eagled the par-4, 340-yard (311 meters) first hole, using a 9-iron
on the blind 110-yard (100.5 meters) shot.	   ``It was an exciting feeling. Unfortunately, I didn't see it go
in,'' said Noble, who finished at 7-over 78 for 155.
	   Stacy, 44, felt comfortable from the start of her 29th straight
Open. She won the title in 1977, '78 and '84, and is trying to join
Betsy Rawls and Mickey Wright as a four-time Open winner.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Tyler Houston homered twice and drove in five
runs, and the Chicago Cubs beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 12-9 Friday
for their fourth win in five games.
	   Henry Rodriguez and Jose Hernandez added solo shots, and Kevin
Tapani won for the first time since June 6, stopping his three-game
losing streak. He allowed seven runs _ six earned _ and 10 hits in
eight-plus innings, striking out eight and walking one.
	   Houston's second homer, his fifth of the season, capped a
five-run third inning that started with hustle on the basepaths by
Sammy Sosa and featured two Pirates errors.
	   Sosa reached on a fielder's choice and sprinted to third on Mark
Grace's single to right, drawing a throw that allowed Grace to take
second. Rodriguez singled him home and Grace came around for a 5-4
lead when center fielder Turner Ward overran the ball.
	   Manny Alexander reached on third baseman Aramis Ramirez's error
and Houston followed with a three-run homer to make it 8-4.
	   Hernandez hit his 12th homer leading off the seventh against
Jeff Tabaka.
	   Chicago added three runs in the eighth off Elmer Dessens on RBI
singles by Kevin Orie and Mickey Morandini, and a throwing error by
Dessens.
	   Pittsburgh scored five times in the ninth. Tapani allowed an RBI
single to Kevin Polcovich and was relieved by Bob Patterson, who
gave up an RBI single to Tony Womack. Terry Adams allowed a
sacrifice fly to Keith Osik, an RBI grounder to Kevin Young and a
run-scoring single to Jose Guillen. Terry Mulholland came on to
strike out Al Martin before Rod Beck, the Cubs fifth pitcher of the
inning, got the final out for his 21st save.
	   Pirates starter Francisco Cordova (6-7), who hasn't won since
May 31, lost his fourth straight decision, giving up eight runs and
eight hits in three innings.
	   The Pirates pounded Tapani for three runs and four hits in the
third, taking a 4-3 lead. Jason Kendall had a RBI double, Young a
sacrifice fly and Guillen a run-scoring hit.
	   Rodriguez hit his 19th homer in the second, Alexander doubled
and Houston homered.
	   Pittsburgh went ahead 1-0 in the top half of the inning on a
run-scoring wild pitch.

	   FREDERIKSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ A ceremony marking the
150th anniversary of the emancipation of slaves was abruptly
canceled Friday after a local politician scuffled with security
personnel.
	   Adelbert Bryan, a senator in this U.S. territory, was originally
scheduled to speak at the ceremony but was not included on the
final program. When he tried to force his way onto the stage, a
security officer stopped him.
	   The ensuing scuffle disrupted the ceremony and Gov. Roy L.
Schneider led several guests off the stage and ended the activity
in protest.
	   Representatives from Denmark, Ghana and South Africa were
attending the ceremony marking the emancipation of slaves in 1848
in what was then a Danish colony.
	   Gov. Schneider raised the possibility of filing charges against
Bryan.
	   ``I'm not surprised by what the senator did but as a community,
we cannot be bossed around by people like Bert Bryan,'' said
Schneider.
	   Bryan has had previous brushes with the law. Earlier this year,
he was convicted of taking and damaging a press photographer's
camera during a Senate session and he was convicted of aggravated
assault in an earlier, separate incident. Bryan is on probation
because of the camera incident.
	   He was acquitted in 1996 of manslaughter charges stemming from
the shooting death of his 25-year-old son on the family farm. He
was also acquitted of charges he was involved in looting following
1989's Hurricane Hugo.
	   Clarence Heyliger, chairman of the Emancipation Commemoration
Commission, said the disruption was ``very unfortunate'' and was
caused by a ``misunderstanding.'' All parties agreed that Bryan was
originally scheduled to speak, but the program was later changed.
	   ``I do not apologize to no one,'' Bryan said in a radio
interview later Friday.

Holyfield says dlrs 20 million won't be enough to fight Lewis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DOTHAN, Alabama (AP) _ If promoters expect Evander Holyfield to
step into a ring with Lennox Lewis, they better come up with a lot
of money.
	   Holyfield, in town Thursday for an LL Cool J concert, told the
Dothan Eagle he wants a guaranteed dlrs 25 million before he'll
agree to fight Lewis.
	   Holyfield, the reigning WBA and IBF champion, said he rejected a
dlrs 20 million offer earlier this week.
	   ``They're going to have to come up with a little more money than
dlrs 20 million,'' Holyfield told The Eagle.
	   ``This fight is bigger now than it was 10 months ago and the
whole world is saying, `We want to see this fight,' ... but should
I take dlrs 20 million?'' Holyfield asked. ``No, I want dlrs 5
million more.''
	   Lewis is the WBC champion, so the winner of the fight would be
the undisputed heavyweight champion.
	   Seth Abraham, president of Time Warner Sports and operator of
HBO cable television, offered dlrs 20 million to Holyfield and dlrs
10 million to Lewis for a bout on Dec. 5 or 12.
	   ``If we have to wait to do it in the year 2000, I will,''
Holyfield said. ``I'm going to keep on winning and I'm sure Lennox
will keep on winning because I'm the only guy out there who'll whip
him.''

Canada has sockeye-sharing deal with Washington state
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Figures are in Canadian dollars. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Canada and Washington state
announced an agreement on sockeye salmon Friday, giving U.S.
fishermen twice as big a share as they had last year.
	   British Columbia fishermen were incensed that Canada agreed to
grant Washington access to about one-quarter of the valuable
sockeye this year around the southern Fraser River.
	   The 24.9 percent share of sockeye _ the largest and most
valuable of five types of Pacific salmon _ doubles the 12.5 percent
share American fishermen took last year, when there was no pact.
	   Friday's one-year deal marked a major political step in sharing
salmon stocks in the hotly disputed waters between British Columbia
and the United States but did little to confirm a long-term
arrangement to replace the lapsed Pacific Salmon Treaty.
	   Federal Fisheries Minister David Anderson hailed the agreement _
the second with Washington state in a week _ as a means of bringing
order to contested waters.
	   ``In terms of getting stability, in terms of our people getting
some certainty, this is a very good deal,'' Anderson told a news
conference. ``An unlimited fishery by the Americans simply means we
will not achieve our conservation goals.''
	   Thousands of British Columbia fishermen rely on Fraser sockeye.
	   Last year, sockeye had a wholesale value of dlrs 207 million,
compared with dlrs 43.8 million for pink and dlrs 34.8 million for
chum.
	   Sockeye in the Fraser is likely to be even more critical this
year due to low projected returns in northern British Columbia
rivers.
	   British Columbia Premier Glen Clark called the latest agreement
a ``sellout of monumental proportions.''
	   ``What we're seeing now is Canada giving unprecedented levels of
sockeye salmon to the Americans.''

 &UR; Little-known Jenkins shoots 65 for first-round lead &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID GINSBURG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLUMBIA, Md. (AP) _ At long last, Tom Jenkins has that winning
feeling again.
	   Jenkins shot a 7-under par 65 Friday for a one-stroke lead over
Graham Marsh after the opening round of the State Farm Senior
Classic. Jenkins, a Senior Tour rookie, last collected a
first-place check in 1975 as a member of the PGA Tour.
	   ``It's all about expectations, and I'm expecting to win,''
Jenkins said. ``It's nice to feel the adrenaline again and to be
able to do what I want out there.''
	   Dave Stockton, Tom Shaw and Terry Dill, who capped his day with
an eagle, were two shots back. Lee Trevino was in a group of four
players at 68.
	   Other contenders included Hale Irwin, who shot a 69, and Arnold
Palmer, birdied the last three holes for a 71 _ only his third
sub-par round of the year.
	   Forty-one of 78 golfers broke par under sunny skies and before a
crowd estimated at 22,000.
	   Jenkins was 3-under before stringing together four straight
birdies on Nos. 13-16. On three of those holes, he left his
approach just one foot from the cup.
	   ``He had a fabulous day,'' said Dill, Jenkins' playing partner.
``That was as good as I've ever seen anyone hit midirons since I've
been on the Senior Tour. It was a pleasure to play with him.''
	   Jenkins, 50, quit the PGA Tour in 1985 and became a club pro for
two years before teaching at golf schools. Responding to a request
from a friend, he played in last year's Senior national qualifying
tournament and gained conditionally exempt status.
	   Jenkins has finished in the top-10 in each of his last three
tournaments, including a second-place showing at the AT and T
Canada Senior Open two weeks ago. His 65 Friday was his 10th
sub-par round in his last 11.
	   ``I could have won the last two events pretty easily if things
went right,'' he said. ``It would be wonderful to win here. It's
nice to get back in the hunt, to get the feeling back.''
	   Jenkins' only win was in the 1975 IVB-Philadelphia Classic. He
can take home a career-best $187,000 with a victory this weekend.
	   Marsh began his day on the 6,983-yard (6383 meters) Hobbit's
Glen Golf Course with a bogey that, fortunately, wasn't a sign of
things to come.
	   ``At that point I thought, `Well, this isn't going to be much
fun,''' he said.
	   Marsh had 10 pars and seven birdies the rest of the way, sinking
a pair of 35-foot putts and a 15-footer (4.6 meters) while going
4-under on the back nine.
	   ``The putter was quite hot there for a while,'' he said. ``All
of a sudden, an average round turned quite nice. I was very pleased
because I haven't been starting well.''
	   It was his best first-round score since last July.
	   Dill started with a birdie, finished with an eagle and had four
birdies and two bogeys in between. His eagle on the par-5, 541-yard
(494.5 meters) 18th hole started with a drive that went 295 yards
(269.65 meters). He then hit a 3-wood within three feet of the
hole.
	   Stockton, who had six birdies and one bogey, seemed just as
pleased with the huge crowd as his position near the top of the
leaderboard. He was clearly delighted to be a part of the first
men's professional event in the Baltimore area in 36 years.
	   ``I don't know why we waited so long to come here,'' Stockton
said. ``Everybody's having a great time _ us and the spectators. I
think this event will be one of our big success stories in 1998.''

 &UR; MONTSERRAT: Volcano erupts, but causes no new damage &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OLD TOWNE, Montserrat (AP) _ After months of silence, the
Soufriere Hills volcano erupted Friday morning, sending super-hot
clouds of gas, ash and rocks plunging to the sea but causing no new
damage.
	   ``This is the biggest eruption since December 1997 and has come
after three months of quiet activity by the volcano,'' said Gill
Norton, deputy chief scientist at the Montserrat Volcano
Observatory on this Caribbean island.
	   The dome collapse spewed ash to 45,000 feet and sent a
pyroclastic flow _ a rapid-moving, 1,000-degree Fahrenheit
(550-degree Celsius) rush of gas, ash and rocks _ charging down the
eastern flank of the mountain to the sea.
	   Most of the island has long been evacuated since the volcano
became active in 1995 and no new damage was done.
 &UR; GUYANA: Unrest ends, nation greets agreement between political
rivals
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Minority political leaders hailed an
agreement between the two major political parties that ended three
weeks of sometimes-violent street demonstrations and allowed
business to return to normal Friday.
	   The handshake between President Janet Jagan and opposition
leader Desmond Hoyte that sealed the deal was featured in
front-page photos in both daily newspapers and was cautiously but
widely acclaimed.
	   ``I think that we've clearly been pulled back from the brink and
we have all won,'' said Rupert Roopnarine, leader of the Alliance
for Guyana, a minor political party.
	   Hoyte's People's National Congress protested and alleged fraud
after Jagan defeated him in the Dec. 15, 1997 presidential
election. Protests erupted again last month even though an
international committee reviewed the elections and found them to be
fair.
	   Stores in the downtown business district of Georgetown, the
capital of this South American country, reopened Friday after weeks
of lost business due to the disturbances.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Third Cuban swimmer deserts team, seeks asylum
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A third woman swimmer deserted the
Cuban national team Friday and will seek political asylum in the
United States, she said.
	   Liudmila Montes de Oca, an 18-year-old specialist in the
butterfly from Villa Clara, Cuba, joined two other swimmers who
left their team on Tuesday. The Cuban athletes were among 27 Cuban
swimmers training for this month's Goodwill Games as guests of the
Puerto Rico Swimming Federation.
	   Sergio Ramos, a lawyer known for helping Cubans apply for
asylum, said the the first two swimmers, Nubis Rosales and Daimara
Munoz, had applied to the Immigration and Naturalization Service
late Thursday for political asylum. An application on behalf of
Montes de Oca would be made Monday, he said.
	   ``We don't expect they will have any problem in obtaining
political asylum,'' said Ramos.
 &UR; VIRGIN ISLANDS: Senator's scuffle interrupts Emancipation Day
event
	   FREDERIKSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ A ceremony marking the
150th anniversary of the emancipation of slaves was abruptly
canceled Friday after a local politician scuffled with security
personnel.
	   Adelbert Bryan, a senator in this U.S. territory, was originally
scheduled to speak at the ceremony but was not included on the
final program. When he tried to force his way onto the stage, a
security officer stopped him.
	   The ensuing scuffle disrupted the ceremony and Gov. Roy L.
Schneider led several guests off the stage and ended the activity
in protest.
	   Representatives from Denmark, Ghana and South Africa were
attending the ceremony marking the emancipation of slaves in 1848
in what was then a Danish colony.
	   Bryan has had previous brushes with the law. Earlier this year,
he was convicted of taking and damaging a press photographer's
camera during a Senate session and he was convicted of aggravated
assault in an earlier, separate incident. Bryan is on probation
because of the camera incident.
	   He was acquitted in 1996 of manslaughter charges stemming from
the shooting death of his 25-year-old son on the family farm.

Gump ties course record; Martin misses cut
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DONNA TOMMELLEO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CROMWELL, Conn. (AP) _ Scott Gump tied the course record with an
8-under-par 62 Friday to take the second-round lead at the Canon
Greater Hartford Open, while Casey Martin made history but didn't
make the cut.
	   Gump's round put him at 10 under for the tournament, one stroke
better than Larry Mize and Omar Uresti. It also matched a season
low on the PGA Tour this year.
	   He started his round on the back nine and had nine birdies,
including four straight midway through the round.
	   ``I got in a good rhythm today,'' he said. ``I just got on a
roll and before you know it I was six or eight under.''
	   Martin, who sued for the right to use a motorized cart in tour
events because of a disability in his right leg, shot a 73 Friday
and was four over for the tournament. The Nike Tour player was
using a sponsor's exemption to compete in his first PGA event, but
missed the cut by five strokes.
	   His round included a triple-bogey 8 on the 523-yard (478 meters)
13th.
	   ``It's disappointing. I played poorly,'' he said, describing No.
13 as ``a meltdown.''
	   The rolls definitely went Gump's way at the TPC at River
Highlands, which was marked Friday by firm fairways and soft
greens. He had birdie putts of 20 and 30 feet and said his birdie
on the 444-yard (406 meters), par-4 18th was ``a bonus.''
	   Gump hit a poor drive into the right fairway bunker about 210
yards (192 meters) from the pin. He used 4-wood and the shot landed
about four feet from the hole. He attributed the birdie to a good
lie in the bunker and some good fortune.
	   ``That was pure luck,'' Gump said. ``You're always trying to do
that, when you pull it up. Anybody that doesn't tell you it's pure
luck is crazy.''
	   A 10-year pro from Rockledge, Fla., Gump has yet to win a
tournament. He is 127th on the money list with dlrs 100,890 and his
best finish this year was a tie for 19th at the BellSouth Classic
in May. His round tied Billy Andrade's 1995 course record.
	   A four-time PGA Tour champion, Mize had seven birdies in his 63,
including one to finish the round.
	   Uresti, like Gump, is still looking for his first win. The
29-year-old Texan, who turned pro in 1991, had a 64. He had eight
birdies and was 11 under at one point, but had bogeys on Nos. 15
and 16 then parred the final two holes. He said a bit of a wait on
the 15th tee made him a little nervous.
	   ``I started thinking about everything too much. My swing got
quick for two holes. After that I was able to settle down,'' he
said.
	   Defending champion Stewart Cink was tied for third at 132 with
Grant Waite and Doug Tewell. Cink had a 65 Friday, while Waite had
a 64 and Tewell a second 66.
	   Seventy-six players made the cut at one under, but among those
missing the cut in addition to Martin were former champions D.A.
Weibring, Billy Ray Brown and David Frost.

Serbs regain control of key Kosovo crossroads

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke in
the Yugoslav capital trying to broker a cease-fire, Serb forces on
Friday broke a two-week rebel siege of a strategic town in the
secessionist Kosovo province, freeing scores of Serb villages and
policemen.
	   Serb police entered Kijevo shortly after dawn, breaking the
ethnic Albanian rebels' hold on the town and fulfilling what was
believed to be Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's remaining
goal in his latest crackdown on Kosovo.
	   Hours after the village was retaken by the Serbs, Holbrooke
arrived in Belgrade, where he met with Milosevic until early
Saturday. Holbrooke, nominated to be America's next ambassador to
the United Nations, refused to say whether he had made progress in
convincing Milosevic to accept a cease-fire.
	   Holbrooke said he would travel Saturday to Pristina for talks
with ethnic Albanian figures, including Ibrahim Rugova, whom he
described as ``the main leader of the Albanians in Kosovo.''
	   Rugova has opposed violence in the Kosovo Albanians' struggle
but has lost prestige among his people because of recent successes
on the battlefield by the militant Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA.
	   Asked whether Washington wanted the KLA included in talks,
Holbrooke said the United States wanted ``everybody who has a
legitimate role in the destiny of Kosovo to have a place in these
discussions, but how that works out remains to be seen.''
	   Holbrooke had called the standoff between Serbs and Albanians in
Kijevo the ``most dangerous place in Europe,'' a flashpoint for a
wider Balkan war. During a visit to the region last month,
Holbrooke tried to get the KLA to end the siege of Kijevo, fearing
Serb forces would use massive force against it and spark a wider
war in the region.
	   The Serb retaking of the town, which freed 100 Serb villagers
and 50 policemen trapped by the rebels, could signal a turning
point, allowing the stalled negotiations to go forward.
	   The ethnic Albanian separatists want independence for Kosovo, a
province in southern Serbia where they outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
Serbia is the largest of two republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
	   Late Friday, both sides reported fighting around Kijevo, 25
kilometers (15 miles) west of the provincial capital Pristina, but
accounts of casualties were conflicting. Journalists were not
allowed into the area.
	   Serb forces were seeking to push the KLA rebels as far west as
possible after ending the siege, Serb police said. At the same
time, the KLA was reinforcing its forces in surrounding villages,
said Murat Musliu, head of an ethnic Albanian human rights group.
	   Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo since Serb forces stepped
up efforts to crush militant resistance in late February. Milosevic
says the crackdown is aimed at Albanian terrorists who have
targeted Serb police in their fight for independence.
	   On the eve of Holbrooke's visit, Milosevic denied any government
repression in Kosovo and offered to restore the autonomy he yanked
from the province in 1989 on grounds of protecting its Serb
minority.
	   Holbrooke is pressing for a cease-fire before trying to get
Milosevic to withdraw his forces. But he and other Western
officials are insistent that Kosovo should not be allowed
independence.
	   On Friday, however, Rugova said autonomy ``is not a solution''
for the province.
	   ``Our aim is an independent, neutral Kosovo with equal rights
for all,'' Rugova told reporters. Noting that other parts of
Yugoslavia had broken away and gained independence, Rugova said
``it is our right to demand independence.''
	   Sitting astride the main east-west road in Kosovo, Kijevo has
been a flashpoint since the KLA surrounded it in mid-June and cut
off its Serb inhabitants. Serb police then surrounded the KLA
fighters.
	   Serb police sources said they suffered no injuries in Friday's
offensive, but the ethnic Albanians had an undetermined number of
casualties.
	   An ethnic Albanian human rights group in the region claimed many
were killed and wounded in the Serb attack, in which they said the
Serbs targeted five villages with tanks, helicopters and artillery.
	   But Western diplomats, citing intelligence reports and speaking
on condition of anonymity, said casualties were not high because
the KLA saw the attack coming and retreated without resisting.

Attempts to trademark Diana's image meet obstacles, newspaper
</HEADLINE>
reports

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Efforts to patent Princess Diana's image have run
into an obstacle at the national Patent Office, but the memorial
fund that made the application said it still had time to overcome
the problem, The Times reported Saturday.
	   The newspaper said that after a seven-month investigation, a
copyright examiner from the government agency objected to the claim
by the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund because the face of
the late princess was not distinctively linked to the goods on
which it may be used, as required by British law.
	   The newspaper did not give a source for its story, but it said
the fund ``understood that the objection was part of the normal
legal procedure,'' and that the fund trustees had until the end of
next month to overcome the objections and their application was not
being withdrawn.
	   The fund can also seek a hearing by a more senior Patent Office
officer, the newspaper said.
	   The memorial fund was established in the days after Diana's Aug.
31 death in a Paris car crash to accept donations that flooded in
from around the world in her memory. The tens of millions of
dollars raised is to be used for charities the princess supported.
Lawyers for the charity applied in December to make Diana's
likeness a trademark, to stop exploitation of her image.
	   The lawyers stressed that trademark legislation provides for a
type of protection similar to that in copyright laws, and is not
expected to affect honest use in the press.
	   The Times said the copyright application included a huge variety
of classes of goods from kitchen utensils to Christmas Tree
decorations. Diana's face, however, had no obvious connection with
a saucepan, a rug or a typewriter, it said.
	   Music and sports stars have been watching the ruling carefully,
the newspaper said, and planned to trademark their own images to
stop commercial organizations using them without permission. Since
her death, Diana's image has appeared on a huge range of souvenirs
from thimbles to T-shirts.

	   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton bid farewell to
China on the eve of America's Independence Day, saying he believes
democracy will come to the communist giant. He praised President
Jiang Zemin as a visionary _ ``the right leadership at the right
time.'' Clinton said Jiang and Premier Zhu Rongji _ who is
dismantling massive state-run industries _ should ``ride the wave
of change and take China fully into the 21st century and basically
dismantle the resistance to it.'' The president's nine-day China
journey was the first by an American president since the 1989
Tiananmen Square crackdown. At a concluding news conference Friday,
he said there had been a remarkable transformation in the world's
most populous nation but there was ``distance still to be
traveled.'' (CLINTON-CHINA)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke in
the Yugoslav capital trying to broker a cease-fire, Serb forces
liberated a strategic town in the secessionist Kosovo province
Friday after a two-week siege. Serb police entered Kijevo shortly
after dawn, freeing about 100 Serb villagers and 50 policemen held
by ethnic Albanian separatists. Breaking the rebels' hold on Kijevo
was believed to be Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
remaining goal in his latest crackdown on Kosovo. Hours after the
village was retaken by the Serbs, Holbrooke arrived in Belgrade,
where he began talks with Milosevic aimed at producing a
cease-fire. Holbrooke, nominated to be America's next ambassador to
the United Nations, had said the standoff between Serbs and
Albanians in Kijevo made the village the ``most dangerous place in
Europe,'' a flashpoint for a wider Balkan war. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and the Palestinians heaped blame on
each other Friday after troops from the two sides confronted the
other with cocked assault rifles and armored personnel carriers in
what began as an argument over control of a Gaza Strip road. The
latest display of distrust came at a time when the United States
appears to be making little headway in winning Israeli agreement on
a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank. Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested Friday that the 12-hour
showdown in Gaza, during which Palestinian truckers blockaded
Jewish settlements, could make Israel even more hesitant to hand
over land to the Palestinians. Israeli hard-liners claim that a
troop pullback would leave more than a dozen settlements isolated
and at the mercy of the Palestinians. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Moshood Abiola, Nigeria's best-known
political prisoner and the presumed winner of presidential
elections in 1993, will probably be freed in the coming days, one
of his wives has said. ``We have every reason to believe he will be
freed any moment from now,'' Doyin Abiola, who manages Abiola's
newspaper group, told Lagos Radio late Thursday night. U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced Thursday that Nigeria will
free all of its remaining political prisoners, including Abiola. He
gave no timetable on the releases. There are believed to be between
250 and 280 political prisoners still held in Nigerian prisons,
though thousands were arrested at various times during the rule of
Gen. Sani Abacha, the Nigerian dictator who died last month. His
successor, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has repeatedly signaled that
he intends to break from his predecessor's policies. (NIGERIA)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The father of a Pakistani man who
claimed to have nuclear secrets to divulge said his son is in fact
an accountant, adding to mounting evidence that the defector
misrepresented himself to the U.S. government. ``He never worked as
a scientist,'' Sikander Khan told state-run Pakistan Television on
Friday. ``He was a business commerce student. He didn't study
science.'' He said his son worked as an accountant for four years.
Iftikhar Chaudhary Khan claims he is a nuclear scientist who
attended a secret meeting where Pakistan mapped out plans to launch
a pre-emptive nuclear strike against rival India. Khan said he fled
to the United States to protest the plans and promised to hand over
documents to substantiate his claims only if granted asylum.

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stock markets, banks and government offices in
the United States are closed today, Friday, July 3, in observance
of Independence Day.
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The South African currency
plunged to a record low against the U.S. dollar for a second
straight day Friday. Shedding nearly 2 percent of its value during
the day, the rand weakened to 6.37 to the U.S. currency, from 6.26
at the opening of local trading. The rand had fallen to 6.44 _ it
weakest ever _ in the morning but it soon recovered as speculators
backed off and no further pressure was expected from U.S. money
markets, which were closed. Commercial banks passed on the higher
cost of money to consumers by hiking their prime lending rate by 1
percent to 23.25 percent and the base home loan rate by 2 percent
to 22 percent, effective from Saturday. On Thursday, the South
African currency fell to 6.35 but then recovered to 6.26 against
the U.S. dollar. Dealers said fluctuations that began a week ago
were expected to continue into next week. The rand has been under
pressure because of the global emerging market crisis sparked by
Asia's financial woes. As the rand became vulnerable, it came under
assault by currency speculators. (SOUTH AFRICA-CURRENCY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Engines on the newest versions of the Boeing
737 must be inspected immediately for signs that a weak part has
failed. The Federal Aviation Administration ordered the action
Thursday after learning that broken engine parts prompted two
in-flight engine shutdowns last week. A ``telegraphic airworthiness
directive'' from the agency, second only in urgency to an emergency
directive, ordered immediate inspections on 46 engines installed on
23 U.S. airliners, 13 of which are owned by Southwest Airlines.
Nine others are owned by Continental Airlines; one is owned by
Eastwind Airlines. The directive also stated that the engine part
in question, the accessory gearbox starter gearshaft, had to be
replaced on all of the aircraft by Sept. 1 or within the next 750
flight hours, whichever comes first. The action followed two
incidents on June 26 involving the latest versions of the world's
most common airliner, the Boeing 737-700 and -800 aircraft. They
are equipped with CFM International CFM56-7B turbofan engines, made
by a joint venture of General Electric and the French company
Snecma. (US-AIRLINER INSPECTIONS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's prime minister Friday said for the first
time he would support a permanent tax cut to stimulate consumer
spending. The statement by Ryutaro Hashimoto at a campaign rally
for July 12 parliamentary elections followed his government's
announcement the day before of a long-awaited plan to clean up the
country's banking crisis. The moves come as Japan is under
increasing pressure from the United States and other trading
partners to gets its economic house in order and create a market
for goods from troubled Asian neighbors. ``I hope we will have not
temporary tax cuts, but so-called permanent tax reforms. I think
we'll move in that direction,'' Hashimoto said. Until now, he had
favoring one-time tax breaks instead of permanent tax relief.
Hashimoto's remarks were echoed by Kan Kato, the head of an
influential government tax research panel, who called for tax cuts
now that the ``bridge bank'' financial stabilization system has
been formally adopted. (JAPAN-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) - President Boris Yeltsin urged Russia's largest
company Friday to help break the ``vicious cycle'' of non-payments
and hand over hundreds of millions of dollars in back taxes.
Yeltsin's comments came a day after the government touched off a
controversy by threatening to seize assets from Gazprom if the huge
gas monopoly didn't pay its overdue taxes. During a meeting Friday,
Yeltsin gave Gazprom head Rem Vyakhirev one day to present a
detailed payment schedule, presidential spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky said. Tax officials also came down hard on Gazprom,
warning Friday that sanctions would be imposed on the monopoly if
it does not settle its debts to the government by August 1, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. The government's inability to
collect taxes is one of its most enduring problems, and the
decision to target Gazprom has set up a showdown between the
government and what is perhaps the country's most powerful company.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Volkswagen AG completed its purchase of
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd. on Friday, but may be missing one of
the most important parts of the deal _ the legendary Rolls brand
name. Volkswagen beat out rival BMW and paid 479 million pounds, or
dlrs 780 million, for Rolls-Royce. But Europe's No. 1 automaker
still has no deal to use the Rolls-Royce name and logo, according
to Rolls-Royce PLC, the jet engine maker that says it still retains
control of the brand. ``Volkswagen (is) aware of our rights to the
name and trademark,'' Rolls-Royce PLC spokesman Martin Brodie said.
``We've not had any detailed discussions.'' Rolls-Royce PLC would
not say whether it would try to block Volkswagen's use of the name
or whether it might try to force the German company to pay for the
right. (BRITAIN-ROLLS ROYCE)

Brazilians, Ronaldo come to quarterfinals rescue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ When the World Cup threatens to get boring, you can
always turn to Brazil.
	   For the second straight game, wunderkind Ronaldo jolted the
quadrennial championship _ and this time it needed it.
	   After a largely lifeless 0-0 draw Friday afternoon where France
finally prevailed over Italy 4-3 on penalties, Ronaldo set up two
first-half goals and lit up the night, sending Brazil into the
semifinals with a 3-2 victory over Denmark.
	   ``Ronaldo showed that is he is not only goals,'' Brazilian coach
Mario Zagallo said. ``His two plays were spectacular.''
	   Against Chile in the second round, Ronaldo score twice but his
play by Zagallo was regarded as average.
	   Friday night, after Denmark's Martin Jorgensen shook Brazil with
a goal in the second minute, Ronaldo set up Bebeto and Rivaldo to
put the defending champions back on track.
	   ``This was the victory of courage,'' Zagallo said. ``This was a
true World Cup game, beautiful, frank and open. All games should be
like this.
	   What the Brazil-Denmark game was, France-Italy was not.
	   After an initial period of repeated chances by the French, the
match degenerated into a series of midfield passes and wasted
chances.
	   And it sent the Italians back home from a World Cup for the
third time from a penalty shootout.
	   Having been eliminated by Argentina in the semifinals in 1990
and beaten by Brazil in the 1994 championship match, Italy is
beginning to believe that it lives under a cloud.
	   ``It's a sort of a curse,'' Italian coach Cesare Maldini said.
``We're walking out of this stadium with our heads up. It's a pity
because it really is a lottery when you go to a shootout. I have no
regrets.''
	   Luigi Di Biagio does, however.
	   After Laurent Blanc took France's last penalty and put Les Bleus
ahead, it was Di Biagio's turn, and he needed to convert to send it
to extra kicks.
	   But he crashed his chance off the middle of the crossbar,
sending the French team streaming onto the field.
	   ``I'm really sorry, so sorry,'' Di Biagio said.
	   ``It's hard to go out of the World Cup this way,'' said Demetrio
Albertini, who had his shootout attempt blocked by goalkeeper
Fabien Barthez.
	   The French, and their fans who filled the 80,000-seat Stade de
France in Saint-Denis, didn't care how they advanced.
	   ``We just wanted this victory more than the Italians did,''
French captain Didier Deschamps said.
	   The victories leave the French with a Wednesday date in
Saint-Denis against the winner of Saturday's Germany-Croatia match.
On Tuesday in Marseille, Brazil will take on either the Netherlands
or South American rival Argentina, which played the quarterfinal
Saturday.
	   The Brazilian fans and media no doubt will go through its usual
microscopic dissection of the match with Denmark, a team it was
expected to beat easily yet struggled for periods due to sloppy
defense.
	   ``It was the spirit of our game which saw us through,'' Cafu
said. ``We are always running for the ball.
	   ``I think we really deserved it. We managed to master the game
completely in the end so I think it would have been unfair for us
not to qualify.''
	   After falling behind early, Brazil responded through Ronaldo.
	   He found Bebeto sprinting through the middle and with a
lazer-like pass, fed the 1994 World Cup hero to make it 1-1 in the
11th minute.
	   Fifteen minutes later, a ball into space on the left found
Rivaldo, who delicately chipped over Danish keeper Peter Schmeichel
for a 2-1 lead.
	   The Danes didn't fold and, with the Brazilians looking as
disheveled in the back to contrast their precision in the front,
tied it six minutes into the second half. Brazilian defender
Roberto Carlos missed an attempted scissors-kick clearance, leaving
the ball to drop at Brian Laudrup's feet.
	   The Glasgow Rangers-turned-Chelsea forward didn't miss from only
eight meters, burying the chance and giving the Danes life.
	   But Rivaldo decided to end the Brazilian anquish 10 minutes
later. Taking the ball from midfield, he raced along the left and
ripped a ground-hugging 25-meter shot that just eluded the
fingertips of Danish keeper Peter Schmeichel and sneaked inside the
right post.
	   ``I am very proud of my players' performance,'' Denmark's
Swedish coach Bo Johansson said. ``It was almost as good as the
best team in the world. All credit to them. I didn't realize they
were quite that good.
	   ``I really think we played a world class game. But we could not
ensure we did not lose, and that's the way it goes.''

World Cup: England great says violence shouldn't harm bid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Bobby Charlton is convinced that England's bid to
host the World Cup in 2006 won't get derailed by the team's own
violent supporters.
	   Already facing rivals Germany and South Africa in a vote to be
taken in June of 2000, England's bidders have had to deal with the
distraction of thugs wearing the flag and colors of their national
team running round Marseille, Toulouse and Lens beating up the
locals.
	   Charlton, who is on the team promoting England's bid, believes
the problem of English fans is frequently taken out of context. And
he says FIFA knows that too.
	   ``We can't let a few who try to make a mark for their own
personal reasons spoil it for the vast majority, the 99.99 percent
who go there to enjoy the games and who always behave,'' said the
former Manchester United star who was on the England team that
triumphed at the 1966 World Cup.
	   ``Why should we let these people stop us trying to get the World
Cup in 2006? I think FIFA appreciate that.
	   ``The problems are all over Europe. I went to see Fiorentina
play Juventus and I couldn't get away from the ground for two hours
because there were running battles. We never heard anything about
that in England, yet when English fans create a problem, it's all
over the world.''
	   According to Charlton, a cornerstone of the English bid is the
way the 1996 European Championship was regarded as a big success
organizational success and had very little crowd trouble.
	   ``We have proved, like at the 1996 European Championship, that
we can organize a tournament without any major trouble from the
fans,'' he said.
	   ``We also don't need any fences around the pitch and we had a
very low profile security presence. Instead of police, we had
stewards, who were always visible with their yellow jackets, and
they weren't called on to do anything major with crowd problems.
	   ``Another thing you have to remember is that at three of the
four games here, English fans filled 80 percent of the grounds and
there was very little trouble inside the stadiums,'' Charlton said.
	   ``We have also done our best to help the French authorities and,
apart from what happened at Marseille, it's not been as bad as
people have made out.''
	   Over two days in the leadup to England's game against Tunisia at
Marseille, 86 fans were detained and 15 people were injured during
sporadic fighting. About half of those detained were English and
some were jailed for between two and four months.
	   ``We can handle it in our own back yard,'' Charlton said. ``It's
only when our fans go abroad that things happen and that's usually
when other fans use them as a target.
	   ``But this is not a problem that football has to solve.''
	   ``To say how do you get rid of soccer violence you have to ask
how do you obliterate terrorism? It is difficult to find out why
they do it,'' Charlton said. ``These people aren't going to tell
you what they're going to do.''

World Cup: France wins shootout to advance to semis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECAPS &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ France wouldn't mind feasting on
tense games like this up to the end of the World Cup. For Italy,
it's just another indigestible shootout.
	   After scoring the first ``Golden Goal'' in World Cup history to
reach the quarterfinals, Les Bleus waited even longer Friday, right
up the penalty shootout before releasing the nation into wild
celebrations for reaching the semifinals.
	   After two hours of tension, the two neighboring soccer giants
were still 0-0.
	   The penalty shootout ended 4-3 after Luigi Di Biagio blasted
Italy's last shootout attempt off the bar.
	   ``It's a curse,'' coach Cesare Maldini said.
	   For the third straight World Cup, Italy has been sent home on
penalties. It lost in the 1990 semifinals to Argentina that way and
succumbed again in 1994 final against Brazil on the ultimate
tiebreaker.
	   ``It takes the coolest heads to win,'' French coach Aime Jacquet
said, lauding defender Laurent Blanc.
	   For Blanc it was time to be hero again, after having scored the
decider against Paraguay to get France to the quarterfinals.
	   ``Now it's so great to be in the semifinals, and whoever we
meet, we will give it everything we have again,'' Jacquet said.
	   France will return to the Stade de France on Wednesday to play
the winner of Saturday's Germany-Croatia match.
	   Almost everything France produced came from Zinedine Zidane, who
had the partisan crowd of 80,000 shouting ``Zizou''.
	   ``This team is feeling better and better in the World Cup,''
Jacquet said.
	   And Italy could not be feeling more miserable. None more so than
Di Biagio.
	   ``I'm really sorry, so sorry,'' the midfielder lamented after he
took over the mantle of goat from Roberto Baggio.
	   Baggio, who led off Italy's penalty kick shootout lineup on
Saturday and scored, missed the vital shot against Brazil four
years ago by sending it over the bar.
	   ``We just wanted this victory more than the Italians did,''
French captain Didier Deschamps said.
	   Yet Italy almost snatched the game in the 102nd minute, when
Baggio ran onto a long pass from Angelo Di Livio and volleyed the
ball on his first touch. It was a piece of magic from the veteran,
but it swerved just past the far post.

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Italian soccer federation president
Luciano Nizzola considers it's a bit early to start thinking about
a new coach for the Azzurri _ since Italy was only eliminated from
the World Cup on Friday.
	   Cesare Maldini's contract expires later this year and the
veteran Italian coach may be replaced by the start of European
Championship qualifying in the fall.
	   ``I must say I was satisfied with the team play in the
competition,'' Nizzola said. ``We were unlucky to lose the penalty
shootout to France. It's untimely to think of a new coach.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NICE, France (AP) _ If the German team could figure a way to
take Chancellor Helmut Kohl with them, it probably would take him
everywhere.
	   It's been 12 years since the Germans have lost a game that Kohl
has attended. Among their victories was the 1996 European
Championship final over the Czech Republic.
	   ``Since our defeat in the World Cup final in Mexico, he's only
seen us win,'' German soccer federation spokesman Wolfgang
Niersbach said.
	   The Germans are hoping for a continuation of their streak on
Saturday. Kohl, who visited the team at their Nice training base
before the tournament, was to be in attendance for their World Cup
quarterfinal in Lyon.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Alessandro Del Piero, identified as
one of the potential stars before the start of the World Cup,
almost wishes he hadn't come at all.
	   ``This World Cup was a nightmare for me,'' the 23-year-old
forward for Juventus said Friday following Italy's elimination from
the tournament in the quarterfinals on penalty kicks by France. ``I
will have bad recollections of France 98. Elimination in the
quarterfinals can be considered a failure for Italy.''
	   Del Piero played portions of four of Italy's five games, but
failed to play up to potential having arrived in France after
suffering a thigh strain in the European Champions Cup final
against Real Madrid on May 20.
	   After scoring 21 goals in the Italian Serie A last season, Del
Piero goes home without a goal in the World Cup.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Despite the entertainment value of the
Argentina-England second-round match at the World Cup, Queen
Elizabeth II was ``not amused'' by an English goal that was
disallowed because of a foul.
	   Lord Provost of Edinburgh, Eric Milligan, said he was a guest of
Her Majesty for a dinner party and the assembly of about 10 guests,
including her husband, Prince Philip, watched the game together on
television TV at the Palace of Holyrood House.
	   ``She was excited at the standard of football on display, but
she was disappointed when the goal was disallowed,'' Milligan said.
``She said `one is not amused', in a parody of herself.''
	   English defender Sol Campbell appeared to score with 11 minutes
remaining, but the goal was disallowed due to a foul by teammate
Alan Shearer. Argentina won the game on penalties after a 2-2 draw.
	   The queen did not stick around with others gathered in front of
the television for the the shootout, Milligan said.
	   ``I'm sure she would have been dismayed at the result, judging
from her reaction when the goal was disallowed. We were all
frustrated,'' he said. ``Then she retired to her apartments to
watch the shootout.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ The red jersey worn by England forward Roger Hunt
during the World Cup final against Germany in 1966 is expected to
be the jewel of a soccer-only auction at Sotheby's.
	   Thursday's sale also will include the No. 6 shirt worn by
Germany's Wolfgang Weber, who marked Hunt throughout the match.
	   ``This is the first time we have had a stand-alone football
catalogue, and it has been timed to coincide with the World Cup,''
Sotheby's spokesman Graham Budd said. ``We are expecting Roger
Hunt's 1966 shirt to arouse the most interest. The red shirt of '66
has become an icon for football fans over the years, and this is
the first time one has come up for sale.''
	   Other items to be auctioned off include the ball used in Pele's
last international match, from Brazil's May 17, 1984, game against
Yugoslavia, and international shirts worn by Englishmen Gary
Lineker, Paul Ince, Gordon Banks and Alan Ball.
	   Sotheby's expect the whole sale to produce about 250,000 pounds
(dlrs 417,500) with Hunt's shirt leading the way at between 30,000
pounds to 50,000 pounds (dlrs 50,000 - dlrs 83,500).

Henmania will have to wait for another year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ So much for Henmania, those two or
three days during Wimbledon when England notices tennis.
	   Tim Henman, loser to Pete Sampras in Friday's semifinals, was
supposed to revive English spirits after they were dumped from the
World Cup by Argentina.
	   Instead, it's wait until next year for the 23-year-old with the
choirboy looks from Oxford _ the first Englishman to reach the
men's semifinal in 25 years. The last Englishman to win it was Fred
Perry in 1936.
	   ``We're not doing so well in cricket, we've gone out of
football, it would be good for British sport if he'd won.'' said
Oliver Bennet, 14, standing next to his mother Sally, who had a
small British flag protruding from her purse.
	   She was one of hundreds at Centre Court urging Henman on waving
flags and wearing Union Jack caps, colorful specks amid tweed, ties
and blazers.
	   One reporter asked if he'd let the nation down.
	   ``I've said all along that when I'm winning, I'm not playing for
the nation,'' Henman said. ``So when I lose, I'm not letting anyone
down.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WELCOME BACK, BORIS: &LR;  Boris Becker is back at Wimbledon.
	   Not on the court, of course. He quit playing Grand Slams last
year after losing to Pete Sampras in the Wimbledon quarterfinals.
	   But he's at the All England Club covering the matches for
British television and made a rare appearance Friday on the
American network NBC with commentator and fellow three-time
Wimbledon champion John McEnroe.
	   ``The Albert Einstein of the Wimbledon grass-court _ Centre
Court,'' McEnroe called Becker, who reached seven Wimbledon finals.
``Sampras has taken the mantle from Boris since his domination.''
	   Boris, any temptation to play Wimbledon again?
	   ``The weeks before the tournament, I started to get itchy,''
said Becker, 30, from the broadcast booth overlooking Centre Court.
``It's a completely new perspective, a new vision for me. It's a
beautiful view here.''
	   Becker, the German Davis Cup manager, had a word of caution to
American men's tennis.
	   ``I don't see any young players from America coming, and once
America was the greatest tennis playing nation in the world,''
Becker said. ``They have to be careful not to lose that.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PETE'S RECORD: &LR;  Sampras has only lost five times at Wimbledon.
	   This is his 37th career Grand Slam. The Henman quarterfinal was
his 173rd. He's 147-26 in Grand Slams and only five players have
won more: Jimmy Connors 233, Ivan Lendl 222, Stefan Edberg 178,
McEnroe 167, Becker 160.
	   However, Sampras' winning percentage is better than all of them
at 85.0 percent followed by Connors (82.6), Lendl (81.9), McEnroe
(81.5), Becker (80.4), Edberg (79.1).
	   In winning four times at Wimbledon, he's 44-5 _ 89.8 percent _
far better than either of the other five. Only five-time Wimbledon
champion Bjorn Borg has a better winning percentage at Wimbledon _
51-4 (92.7 percent).
	   ___ &QC; 
	   60 YEARS AGO: &LR;  Bunny Austin, the last British man to reach the
Wimbledon finals _ losing in 1938 to American Don Budge _ received
five pounds (dlrs 8) for that performance. He said he spent it on a
gold pen for his wife, who promptly lost it.
	   Austin, a month from his 92nd birthday, lost 6-1, 6-0, 6-3 to
Budge in that final.
	   ``I wasn't very good,'' Austin said, speaking from the nursing
home where he lives in southern England. ``I couldn't serve and my
overhands were poor. Of course, I worked on the stock exchange in
the morning and played matches in the afternoon.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   15,541 FEWER FANS: &LR;  In play through Friday, attendance was down
15,541 on 1997. This despite last year being the wettest Wimbledon
in history with two days rained out. The explanation? The lack of
compelling matches and Wimbledon going head-to-head with soccer's
World Cup in France.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MARATHON: &LR;  The last set of Goran Ivanisevic's semifinal win over
Richard Krajicek _ 15-13 _ was a long one but nowhere near the
longest at Wimbledon. Twice 46 games have been played in a set, but
both came in the 1960s before the tiebreaker was instituted.

Japan's Planet-B Mars probe roars into orbit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Planet-B probe to Mars blasted into space
Saturday, beginning the first effort by a nation other than the two
former Cold War superpowers to visit another world.
	   The 450-kilo (half-ton) unmanned craft was launched from
Kagoshima Space Center in southern Japan without problems, the
state-run NHK television said.
	   Planet-B, renamed Nozomi or ``Hope'' after liftoff, is scheduled
to begin beaming back photographs and experimental data from the
Red Planet in October 1999.
	   Japan is only the third nation after the United States and
Russia to have attempted an interplanetary space mission. Europe's
space consortium cooperated with the U.S.-launched Cassini probe to
Saturn but has not conducted its own mission.
	   One reason Japan chose the July 4 liftoff date was to celebrate
the first anniversary of the United States' Mars Pathfinder
mission, officials said.
	   But unlike the Pathfinder, which broadcast dramatic images from
the Martian surface, the Japanese probe will conduct experiments
from orbit high above the planet.
	   Planet-B will swing by Earth twice to pick up enough speed to
make the 700 million-kilometer (440 million-mile) journey to Mars
in 10 months.
	   Once there, the 11 billion yen (dlrs 80 million) probe will
examine the Martian atmosphere to study how it reacts to solar

Israel, Palestinians trade accusations after Gaza standoff

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The latest display of distrust between Israel
and the Palestinians has come at a time when the United States
appears to be making little headway in winning Israeli agreement on
a troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israel and the Palestinians heaped blame on each other Friday
after troops from the two sides confronted the other with cocked
assault rifles and armored personnel carriers in what began as an
argument over control of a Gaza Strip road.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested Friday that
the 12-hour showdown in Gaza, during which Palestinian truckers
blockaded Jewish settlements, could make Israel even more hesitant
to hand over land to the Palestinians. Israeli hard-liners claim
that a troop pullback would leave more than a dozen settlements
isolated and at the mercy of the Palestinians.
	   ``You could also understand how sensitive we are to the issue of
redeployment, which could place tens of thousands of Israelis ...
at great peril any time the Palestinians decide to violate the
agreement, as they did last night,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of staging a deliberate
provocation and said Israel would not succumb to threats of
violence.
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, dismissed
Netanyahu's accusation, saying the Palestinian Authority had made
every possible effort to defuse the situation.
	   Netanyahu ``is the one to be blamed for the tense situation on
the ground'' because he has refused to live up to Israel's
promises, including a troop pullback, Erekat said.
	   The Gaza confrontation began with a routine argument over the
use of a road. About two-thirds of the Gaza Strip is controlled by
the Palestinian Authority, but Israeli troops patrol near Jewish
settlements and control several access roads.
	   On Thursday afternoon, Palestinian Supplies Minister Abdel Azziz
Shaheen demanded that Israel allow a convoy of 22 Palestinian cars
to use a coastal route it controls. Israeli soldiers said they
would let Shaheen pass because as a Cabinet minister he has special
privileges, but told the others to turn back.
	   The dispute quickly escalated into scuffles and shouting matches
between Israeli and Palestinian troops. Israeli troops stationed
three armored personnel carriers on a road linking two major Gaza
Strip cities and created a huge traffic jam. In retaliation,
Palestinian police ordered dozens of trucks to block access roads
to Jewish settlements. Israel, in turn, sealed off the Gaza Strip.
	   As night fell, both sides dug roadside trenches and took up
positions just a few dozen yards from one another _ with rifles
pointed.
	   Under a compromise reached early Friday, with the help of U.S.
Mideast envoy Dennis Ross, the Palestinians agreed to move the
trucks from the settlement roads while Israel allowed Shaheen and
his convoy to drive along the coastal road.
	   In other developments Friday:
	   _ Israel's outgoing armed forces chief of staff undercut
Netanyahu's initial claim that a 13 percent troop pullback would
endanger Israel's security and that Israel could hand over no more
than 9 percent. ``The difference ... between 9 and 13 percent _
it's not that it is trivial, not that it is unimportant _ but it is
certainly not very, very dramatic,'' Lt. Gen. Amnon Shahak told
Israel army radio in a farewell interview.
	   _ Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan, citing an intelligence
report, said 21 prominent Islamic militants have been recruited by
Palestinian police, including six involved in planning suicide
bombings in Israel. If confirmed, the report would undermine
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's claim that he is doing the best
he can to rein in Islamic militants.

Abiola wife says he'll be free soon

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has
expressed confidence that Nigeria's military ruler will free all
remaining political prisoners, including Moshood Abiola, the
country's best-known political prisoner and the presumed winner of
1993 presidential elections.
	   Annan made his announcement Thursday. However, he gave no
timetable on the releases, just saying ``the government will make
an announcement at the appropriate time.''
	   There are believed to be between 250 and 280 political prisoners
still held in Nigerian prisons, though thousands were arrested at
various times during the rule of Gen. Sani Abacha, the Nigerian
dictator who died last month.
	   His successor, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has repeatedly signaled
that he intends to break from his predecessor's policies.
	   One of Abiola's wives also said she believes her husband will
probably be freed in the coming days.
	   ``We have every reason to believe he will be freed any moment
from now,'' Doyin Abiola, who manages Abiola's newspaper group,
told Lagos Radio late Thursday night.
	   Mrs. Abiola also said she met with Emeka Anyaoku,
secretary-general of the Commonwealth of former British colonies,
since his meeting with her husband earlier this week. But she gave
no further details.
	   Annan, speaking Friday in Accra, Ghana, where he was meeting
with President Jerry Rawlings and other top officials, said he
believed Nigeria would again become a democratic country.
	   ``I am sure it can be done,'' Annan, who is Ghanaian, said at a
press conference. ``Abubakar seems determined to return the country
to constitutional rule.''
	   He said the United Nations would offer assistance to Nigeria
during the electoral process and urged the rest of the
international community to do the same.
	   Nigeria's Provisional Ruling Council, meanwhile, the core of the
ruling junta, met Thursday night to discuss the releases,
government officials said on condition of anonymity.

Pak steady but Lopez has worst Open round of career

be UPDATED with later finishers. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ Rookie Se Ri Pak continued to tame the
Blackwolf Run Course that crushed the likes of Nancy Lopez and Meg
Mallon in the second round of the U.S. Women's Open.
	   Pak, a 20-year-old from South Korea who won the McDonald's LPGA
Championship in May, followed an opening round 2-under-par 69 with
a 70 on Friday and was the early leader at 3-under 139 halfway
through the biggest event in women's golf.
	   Because of high scores, slow play and a 51-minute lightning
delay, it appeared likely the 36-hole cut wouldn't be determined
until Saturday morning.
	   Lopez and playing partners Mallon and Jane Geddes were so
deflated by their play Friday that they approached the 18th green
waving white towels.
	   ``Jane said we ought to walk up to 18 waving the white flag,''
Mallon said. ``That's pretty much how we felt. The course
definitely won.''
	   Lopez's 83 was the worst of her 81 career Open rounds and left
her at 18-over 160. Mallon shot a 76 for 153, Geddes a 79 for 157.
	   Blackwolf Run got the best of them _ and many others.
	   Kim Williams, who shared the first-round lead with Laura Davies
at 3-under, stumbled to a 10-over 81 for a two-day total of 149.
Davies had a 75 and, at 143, was four strokes off the lead.
	   Not everybody had trouble.
	   Dottie Pepper duplicated her 71 to reach the halfway point at
even par. Mhairi McKay's 70 also put her even.
	   And three-time Open winner Hollis Stacy, playing in a
record-tying 29th straight Open, followed a 76 on Thursday with a
3-under 68 for 144.
	   Pat Hurst, who began the day one shot off the lead, and
Liselotte Newmann, who was two back, were among the challengers who
teed off in the afternoon and were still on the course as dusk
approached.
	   After 36 holes, the 60 lowest scores and ties and anyone within
10 strokes of the lead will make the cut.
	   With wind whipping off Lake Michigan and a few pins tucked
behind bunkers, second-day scores soared on the unyielding
6,412-yard (5861 meters), par-71 layout.
	   Lopez has finished second in the Open four times, including last
year, when she lost by a shot to Alison Nicholas in a dramatic
finish at Pumpkin Ridge.
	   Displaying her usual graciousness, smile she did as the gallery
at 18 gave her a prolonged ovation, chanting ``Nancy! Nancy!'' just
like last year when she approached the final hole on Sunday with a
chance to win the only trophy in women's golf that has eluded her.
	   Now it will have to wait for another course, another year, if
ever.
	   Lopez, who began the day at 6-over-par 77, misfired on the first
hole, hitting a woman fan in the face.
	   She parred the first four holes before running into a string of
bad luck that lasted an excruciating eight holes and more than two
hours.
	   From the fifth hole to the 12th, Lopez collected five bogeys and
three double bogeys. Her nightmarish run ended with a par on the
142-yard 13th hole, by which time she was 20 strokes off the lead.
	   She put her tee shot into the water on 18 for double bogey.
	   Williams had three bogeys and a double bogey on her first seven
holes on the Pete Dye-designed layout renowned for greens so fast
that men's two-time Open champion Ernie Els suggested the women
practice by putting in a bathtub.
	   Having never won in 12 years on the LPGA tour and playing with a
bad back that forced her to wear a brace and even recline on some
of the tees, Williams' early success was as surprising as Lopez's
lasting frustration.
	   Karen Noble got the second round off to a big start when she
eagled the par-4, 340-yard first hole, using a 9-iron on the blind
110-yard shot.
	   ``It was an exciting feeling. Unfortunately, I didn't see it go
in,'' said Noble, who finished at 7-over 78 for 155.
	   Stacy, 44, felt comfortable from the start of her 29th straight
Open, which tied Kathy Whitworth's record set from 1959-87.
	   Stacy, who won the title in 1977, '78 and '84, is trying to join
Betsy Rawls and Mickey Wright as a four-time Open winner.

Briton jailed after admitting to stabbing Frenchman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GRENOBLE, France (AP) _ A 43-year-old English fan was jailed
early Saturday after admitting to stabbing a Frenchman who died in
the attack after a World Cup match between England and Argentina.
	   Paul Birch admitted to the crime after 10 hours of questioning
by an investigating judge that ended in the early hours of Saturday
morning, judicial officials said. He was jailed in
St-Quentin-Fallavier, in the Isere region.
	   The judge placed him under formal investigation for murder _ one
step short of being formally charged.
	   Birch, an engineer from London, was not a known soccer hooligan.
	   He admitted to stabbing actor Eric Frachet, 33, on the train
from Lyon to Grenoble Tuesday night, following England's defeat in
the game in Saint-Etienne, near Lyon.
	   He was arrested Wednesday night in a Grenoble hotel, following a
dispute with the hotel's night guard. Police quickly linked him to
the stabbing.
	   According to police officials speaking on customary anonymity,
the man was sitting across from Frachet on the train and thought
that the smiling actor was an Argentinian fan mocking him.

Little-known Jenkins shoots 65 for first-round lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECAPS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID GINSBURG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLUMBIA, Maryland (AP) _ At long last, Tom Jenkins has that
winning feeling again.
	   Jenkins shot a 7-under par 65 Friday for a one-stroke lead over
Graham Marsh after the opening round of the State Farm Senior
Classic. Jenkins, a Senior Tour rookie, last collected a
first-place check in 1975 as a member of the PGA Tour.
	   ``It's all about expectations, and I'm expecting to win,''
Jenkins said. ``It's nice to feel the adrenaline again and to be
able to do what I want out there.''
	   Dave Stockton, Tom Shaw and Terry Dill, who capped his day with
an eagle, were two shots back. Lee Trevino was in a group of four
players at 68.
	   Other contenders included Hale Irwin, who shot a 69, and Arnold
Palmer, birdied the last three holes for a 71 _ only his third
sub-par round of the year.
	   Forty-one of 78 golfers broke par under sunny skies and before a
crowd estimated at 22,000.
	   Jenkins was 3-under before stringing together four straight
birdies on Nos. 13-16. On three of those holes, he left his
approach just one foot from the cup.
	   ``He had a fabulous day,'' said Dill, Jenkins' playing partner.
``That was as good as I've ever seen anyone hit midirons since I've
been on the Senior Tour. It was a pleasure to play with him.''
	   Jenkins, 50, quit the PGA Tour in 1985 and became a club pro for
two years before teaching at golf schools. Responding to a request
from a friend, he played in last year's Senior national qualifying
tournament and gained conditionally exempt status.
	   Jenkins has finished in the top-10 in each of his last three
tournaments, including a second-place showing at the AT and T
Canada Senior Open two weeks ago. His 65 Friday was his 10th
sub-par round in his last 11.
	   ``I could have won the last two events pretty easily if things
went right,'' he said. ``It would be wonderful to win here. It's
nice to get back in the hunt, to get the feeling back.''
	   Jenkins' only win was in the 1975 IVB-Philadelphia Classic. He
can take home a career-best $187,000 with a victory this weekend.
	   Marsh began his day on the 6,983-yard (6383 meters) Hobbit's
Glen Golf Course with a bogey that, fortunately, wasn't a sign of
things to come.
	   ``At that point I thought, `Well, this isn't going to be much
fun,''' he said.
	   Marsh had 10 pars and seven birdies the rest of the way, sinking
a pair of 35-foot putts and a 15-footer (4.6 meters) while going
4-under on the back nine.
	   ``The putter was quite hot there for a while,'' he said. ``All
of a sudden, an average round turned quite nice. I was very pleased
because I haven't been starting well.''
	   It was his best first-round score since last July.
	   Dill started with a birdie, finished with an eagle and had four
birdies and two bogeys in between. His eagle on the par-5, 541-yard
(494.5 meters) 18th hole started with a drive that went 295 yards
(269.65 meters). He then hit a 3-wood within three feet of the
hole.
	   Stockton, who had six birdies and one bogey, seemed just as
pleased with the huge crowd as his position near the top of the
leaderboard. He was clearly delighted to be a part of the first
men's professional event in the Baltimore area in 36 years.
	   ``I don't know why we waited so long to come here,'' Stockton
said. ``Everybody's having a great time _ us and the spectators. I
think this event will be one of our big success stories in 1998.''

	   MERIDA, Venezuela (AP) _ Think Venezuela and you envision talcum
powder beaches, steamy Amazon jungles and coral reefs. But
snow-capped Andean mountains 4,765 meters (15,633 feet) high?
	   Yes, the country that calls itself the gateway to South America
is known for its tropical delights. What's less known is that it
also is home to a charming Andean mountain city with lush green
valleys, starkly beautiful high plains and the world's longest and
highest cable car system.
	   Cheap, safe and tranquil, Merida is an attractive alternative to
Venezuela's main tourist destinations: Margarita Island, the
pristine Los Roques archipelago and Canaima National Park, site of
the world's highest waterfall.
	   A college town of 210,000 people, Merida is surrounded by
fertile mountains where farmers still plow steep terraced plots
with oxen, mark their property with stone walls and cart their
carrots and potatoes off to market by mule.
	   The highlight of a trip to the 1.6-kilometer-high (mile-high)
city, located 700 kilometers (420 miles) southwest of Caracas, is
the cable car.
	   Sightseers glide up to Pico Espejo (Mirror Peak), which at 4,765
meters (15,633) is higher than Switzerland's Matterhorn. Espejo's
sister peak, Bolivar, is Venezuela's highest at 5,007 meters
(16,427 feet).
	   In Merida itself, tourists can stroll through tree-lined Bolivar
Plaza, visit the nearby cathedral, buy crafts and sweaters at the
huge ``Mercado Principal'' (Main Market) and walk through the
city's numerous parks. Parque Beethoven has a clock with wooden
soldiers who march around a guard house to Beethoven compositions
when the hour strikes.
	   For those looking for an unusual culinary experience, the
Coromoto ice cream parlor offers _ at last count _ 709 flavors,
including fish, spaghetti, chili, beer and corn, along with more
standard combinations such as champagne, caramel and nuts. It's
listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for the most _ and
most bizarre _ flavors.
	   You may also want to try mountain biking or hiking, horseback
riding, bathing in hot springs, trout fishing or the latest local
craze _ paragliding.
	   Some of Merida's best attractions are the quaint villages
outside of it. Almost all are centered on a Bolivar Plaza and a
Catholic church, underscoring both the deep religious nature of the
reserved Andean people and their equally fervent worship of 19th
century independence hero, Simon Bolivar.
	   Rent a car or hire a guide to take you north up the picturesque
Trans-Andean Highway, tracing the general path of Bolivar on his
campaign to free South America from Spanish rule. Or fly from
Caracas to Valera in Trujillo state and make your way south along
the highway to Merida.
	   The road climbs until it's literally amid the clouds. Paso del
Aguila (Eagle Pass) is the highest point in Venezuela's highway
system at 4,007 meters (13,146 feet). You can ward off the cold
there by sipping hot chocolate at a roadside restaurant.
	   Nearby is an entrance to Sierra Nevada National Park, notable
for its haunting glacial lagoons, cotton-soft shrubs called
``frailejones'' and desolate but beautiful ``paramos,'' plains that
are above the tree line.
	   The gray-green frailejones, the paramo's main plant, are found
only in Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador. From October to December
they blossom with yellow flowers, turning the mountains into a mass
of green and yellow.
	   Visitors can hike through the park to the enchanting Black
Lagoon, which sits at the bottom of a valley with clouds hovering
just above its water.
	   Bird-lovers hiking the region's mountains can spot such species
as the bearded helmetcrest hummingbird, the Merida sunangel, the
black-chested buzzard-eagle and, occasionally, a condor.
	   Farther along the highway are typical Andean villages with
Indian names such as Mucuchies. In San Rafael de Mucuchies is a
small, curious chapel made of thousands of stones by a local
artist, Juan Felix Sanchez.
	   Other towns to the south and west of Merida also make for
popular day trips. One, Jaji, is a lovely village set on a
mountainside and restored to its colonial origins.
	   Even closer and equally pleasant is a drive through El Valle
(The Valley) and La Culata (The Haunches), where horses and cows
graze on vast green pastures.
	   Merida's climate is pleasant and mild, with an average
temperature of 66, though it can dip to as low as 41 at night. If
you forget a jacket, you can always buy a ``ruana,'' the colorful
woolen poncho typical of the region.
	   While the city offers a range of hotels, another alternative is
the numerous ``posadas'' that are Latin America's version of
bed-and-breakfasts (usually without the breakfast). The best ones
are family-run operations that offer cozy atmospheres and personal
attention.

A thrilling ride on the world's highest cable car

	   MERIDA, Venezuela (AP) _ A trip to Merida isn't complete without
a ride up the world's longest and highest cable car system.
	   Stretching 12.5 kilometers (7.8 miles) over green forest,
gushing waterfalls, gaping canyons and sheer rock faces up to
windswept plains above the timber line, Merida's hour-long cable
car ride is an unforgettable experience.
	   ``This rivals Alaska any day,'' said Donna Messer, a petroleum
geologist from Houston, Texas, who was basking in the Andean
mountain's beauty.
	   The ride starts at the base station in Merida, where shorts and
T-shirts are enough clothing in sunny 16 C (61 F) weather. By the
time they reach the upper stations, riders pull on jackets, gloves
and hats to ward off weather cold enough to produce ice and snow.
	   At Loma Redonda (Round Hill), the third of four stations, a
magnificent hush fills the air, the only sound the wind whistling
in your ears. Visitors can stand on a perch overlooking the
shimmering twin black lagoons called Los Anteojos (The Eyeglasses).
	   You also enjoy a spectacular view of Venezuela's highest point,
Bolivar Peak, which soars up 5,007 meters (16,427 feet), and its
sister peak, Espejo (Mirror).
	   On top of Espejo is a statue of the Virgen de las Nieves (Virgin
of the Snows), the patron saint of mountaineers; on Bolivar, a
statue of South American independence hero Simon Bolivar.
	   At Round Hill, an old mule trail leads to Los Nevados, a village
that tourists often visit by riding a mule for about six hours.
Don't be surprised to be met by ruddy-faced Andean farmers and boys
dressed in colorful ponchos and leading their mules.
	   The cable car system was built in the late 1950s by a French
company during the reign of Marcos Perez Jimenez, Venezuela's
master builder and its last dictator.
	   It shut in 1991 after a cable broke on the last leg and two
people were killed. It reopened partially in 1996; tourism
officials expect the fourth and last leg of the tram system leading
to Pico Espejo to be running by this fall.
	   Tickets cost 7,500 bolivars (dlrs 14) for adults and 3,000
bolivars (dlrs 5.60) for children. The tram system operates daily
except Mondays and Tuesdays.
	   The first car leaves at 8 a.m. Get on line an hour early in busy
tourist seasons such as Christmas, Holy Week and late July to early
September. That's to avoid long lines and the thick late-morning
clouds that blanket the mountaintop.

Jump off a cliff with a parachute? Why not?

	   MERIDA, Venezuela (AP) _ The idea seemed crazy: Jump off a cliff
with a parachute and float 900 meters (3,000 feet) to the ground.
	   But my traveling companions insisted, so I suited up.
	   Paragliding is the latest craze in Merida, and it's not hard to
see why. Besides its cousin hang-gliding, it's about the closest a
human being can get to feeling like a soaring bird.
	   Our pony-tailed guides from Guamanchi Expeditions took us in
their jeep up a long, winding dirt road to our takeoff point, ``La
Tierra Negra'' (The Black Land). During the bumpy ride, I quizzed
our lead guide Jose Albarran about his experience and the dangers
of paragliding.
	   He assured me he'd been flying for a decade, leaping off
mountains from Canada to Switzerland, and had never had an accident
or even used his emergency parachute.
	   Three people have been killed in recent years flying off Tierra
Negra, he said, but mainly because of risky maneuvers. It's one of
the top paragliding points in the world because of its beauty, good
weather conditions and lack of obstacles such as power lines.
	   Albarran laid out his 20-foot-wide (6-meter-wide) yellow
parachute, plopped a helmet on my head, strapped me into a harness,
fit himself in behind and told me to start running.
	   The chute filled and we were airborne.
	   I looked down and saw trees, shrubs, rocky mountainsides and
streams several hundred feet (kilometers) below me. If the chute
collapsed, we'd go plummeting to the ground, unless Albarran had
time to open the emergency chute.
	   Tugging at control ropes, he made us do U-turns in the air and
sweep across the mountainface several times. We went down and back
up and down again.
	   I relaxed and took in the view of Merida's red-roofed houses,
the white waters of the Rio Chama, the towering Andean mountains
and the endless green fields in the valley. It was beautiful, and
so peaceful _ the only sound the wind whistling through holes in
our helmets.
	   The only sound, that is, until Albarran's cellular telephone
rang. It was the phone company calling about a bill.
	   Slowly we drifted downward. Albarran spiraled us toward the dirt
landing area, and told me to run fast when we hit ground to cushion
the impact.
	   It was hardly necessary. We landed so softly I took two small
steps and it was over. I'd made it!

	    &UR; If You Go ...
	   Merida is a bargain for travelers. A round-trip flight from
Caracas costs about 80,000 bolivars (dlrs 147) on Venezuela's
national airline, Avensa, and slightly less on other airlines, such
as Lai or Air Venezuela.
	   A range of hotels is available, including the three-star Chama
Hotel (14,000 bolivars or dlrs 26 for a double) or the four-star
Park Hotel (41,000 bolivars or dlrs 77 for a double with air
conditioning).
	   Perhaps an even better bet are the region's numerous
``posadas,'' or family-run guest houses. Among the more charming
ones are ``Los Bucares'' at 4th Avenue and 15th Street, run by
former chemistry teacher Americo Sanchez, (8,600 bolivars or dlrs
16 for a double, 12,500 bolivars or dlrs 23 for a triple).
	   Next door is the equally attractive Posada La Casona de Margot,
which charges about 1,000 bolivars (dlrs 1.85) more a night.
	   A couple of hours outside of Merida, on the Trans-Andean Highway
heading toward the city of Barinas, is the charming Hotel Los
Frailes (The Friars), a converted 17th-century monastery. A double
costs about 27,000 bolivars (dlrs 50).
	   Eating in Merida is cheap: A good steak dinner can cost as
little as 3,200 bolivars (dlrs 6) a person. And make sure to try
the delicious local milkshakes called ``vitaminas'' (vitamins).
	   Taxis to get around town are more than reasonable. Short trips
cost 1,000 bolivars (dlrs 1.87), while longer ones shouldn't go
much beyond 2,000 bolivars (dlrs 3.75).
	   Peak tourist times are Christmas, Holy Week and Carnival
holidays, and from late July to early September.

	    &UR; If You Go ...
	   Thinking about joining an archaeological dig? Here's how to get
started and what you'll need to bring:
	   COST: At Caesarea, dormitory-style room and full board for
volunteers is approximately dlrs 375 a week from Sunday-Thursday.
Volunteers are taken on two weekend touring trips to Israel's north
and south but are on their own for the two remaining weekends.
Airfareis not included.
	   Students interest in receiving academic credit have to pay an
additional dlrs 1,000 to register for the four-week field school.
Some digs, though not Caesarea, also have an application fee.
	   WHAT TO BRING: A trowel or digging tool. Sun screen, a hat and
canteen are all essentials for braving the summer heat when
temperatures can sore to 40 C (104F). Extra money for snacks,
touring and laundry.
	   All volunteers must supply their own linens, towels and
toiletries; an alarm clock is a good idea. There is only one pay
phone for volunteers at the dormitory and there is no drugstore or
pharmacy near the site, so bring what you need from home.
	   CLOTHING: Bring shorts and T-shirts for field work and try to
avoid white. Clothes get very dirty on the dig. Bring a bathing
suit, as the dig is just a stone's throw from the beach, and modest
attire such as pants or skirts and long-sleeved shirts required for
visits to holy sites. If you plan to participate in the underwater
dig, you'll need to bring your own wet suit and SCUBA
certification.
	   ACADEMIC CREDIT: Students earn academic credit through the field
school. If you are a student interested in receiving academic
credit but are not enrolled in a college affiliated with a dig
site, check ahead of time with your school registrar about credit
transfer. After the dig is over, get a transcript or a letter from
the site director verifying your participation and fulfillment of
requirements. Because it is a transfer credit, some schools will
accept only the credits and not the grade. Find out before you go.
	   WHERE TO DIG: A list of archaeological digs in Israel is
available on the Web at the following two sites:
	   Holy Land Expeditions:
http://www.inmind.com/holyland/manual.htm.
	   Israeli government web site:
	   http://www.israel-mfa.gov.il/archdigs.html

	   CAESAREA, Israel (AP) _ A Latin teacher, a hospital
administrator and a nun are part of a volunteer corps exploring the
foundations of a 2,000-year-old seaside temple built by King Herod.
	   Most of the 107 volunteers rise at dawn to scrape away the
reddish-tinted earth that obscures the ancient limestone blocks.
	   Others don scuba gear and plunge into the Mediterranean Sea,
using an air bag the size of a Volkswagen Beetle to move rocky
rubble from a site so it can be explored.
	   ``The volunteers get great diving experience _ three or four
dives a day and at the end of four weeks, you're a great diver,''
says Trad Hughes of Washington, D.C., a tan and muscular former
government bureaucrat who is spending his second summer at the dig.
	   During the summer, the peak dig season, volunteers can find work
on 24 archaeological sites in Israel. These include Canaanite ruins
near Ashkelon, Roman and Byzantine remains on the Dead Sea, and a
Bronze-age site at Megiddo, the Biblical Armageddon.
	   Most of the digs are sponsored by U.S. universities, and most of
the volunteers are American college students.
	   Seymour Gitin, director of the W.F. Albright Institute of
Archaeological Research, says that over the past two decades digs
have increasingly become outdoor classrooms, and as a result the
quality of the volunteer workers has improved.
	   Archaeological expeditions fund part of their field work from
fees paid by student volunteers. The students get college credit
for their work in return.
	   At Caesarea, students pay dlrs 1,000 tuition for four weeks in
the field school and can earn up to six college credits.
	   During the course, they attend lectures on the history of
Caesarea and participate in workshops in which they learn how to
``read'' pottery _ determine its origin by its style and
composition. The student archaeologists also have to write two
research papers based on their work.
	   Not all the volunteers, however, are students.
	   ``We've had physicians; we've had a trolley car operator; we've
had nurses and pilots,'' says supervisor Farland Stanley Jr., a
former rock musician and now an assistant professor of classics at
the University of Oklahoma at Norman, Oklahoma.
	   Stanley, sporting a red bandanna and a wide-brimmed straw hat,
is top kick on the Caesarea Combined Expeditions, which has used
1,800 volunteers over the past nine years to explore a temple built
about 22 B.C. by King Herod to show his loyalty to Augustus Caesar.
	   Sister Laurie Brink of Chicago, Illinois, left her habit behind
this summer to dig in khaki shorts and Birkenstock sandals at the
Caesarea excavation where ruins of an ancient church sit atop the
Temple foundation. She came to Caesarea as a volunteer three years
ago, prompted by her interest in biblical studies, and is now a
staff member.
	   Michelle Peters, a Pennsylvania State University junior who
wears her silver lipstick and nose rings everyday to the dig,
gently brushed away dirt to uncover pottery shards and then
carefully placed them in a bucket nearby to be read later that
afternoon.
	   Underwater, the treasures can be even more bountiful. The
promise of finding ancient artifacts in good shape is greater
underwater than on land, due to water's preserving qualities. Last
season's team uncovered gold coins, whole plates and jugs, and
wooden hair combs.
	   But you can't take anything home with you. Israeli law forbids
the removal of finds from dig sites and has prosecuted offenders.
	   Back on land, Brad Chamberlain, a second-year digger, says
volunteering helped set him on a career path. A native of Houston,
Texas, he came to Caesarea the first time to see if archaeology was
really what he wanted to do.
	   ``I thought I wanted to be an archaeologist, but until last year
I didn't know. On my first day, it was like, 'This is it,''' says
the University of Oklahoma senior.
	   But don't be fooled. Digging is hard work. Volunteers are up at
the crack of dawn and spend up to eight hours in the heat before
attending afternoon lectures and workshops.
	   Despite the hours in the sun and cramped dormitory rooms, the
desire to return is strong among students.
	   ``It's the only thing that can get me up at 4:45 in the
morning,'' Chamberlain chuckles.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ An alleged Shining Path guerrilla
suspected of carrying out some of Peru's worst terrorist attacks
was extradited Friday under heavy security.
	   Cecilia Rosana Nunez Chipana, also known as ``Comrade Ana,'' was
put aboard a helicopter Friday at Los Teques women's prison and
flown to Simon Bolivar International Airport outside Caracas, where
she was handed over to Peruvian authorities who hustled her onto a
state-owned plane bound for Peru.
	   Twenty heavily armed Venezuelan security agents accompanied her
to the airport.
	   The extradition was carried out despite protests by human rights
activists who believe Nunez might be tortured in Peru or receive
the death penalty or a life sentence.
	   Venezuela's Supreme Court ordered the extradition last month.
Defense lawyers appealed, but Venezuelan Justice Minister Hilarion
Cardozo said officials did not need to wait for a ruling.
	   ``I have no information that tells me I should not carry out the
decision'' to extradite Nunez, he said.
	   Nunez entered Venezuela with a false passport in October and was
arrested in February. She denied belonging to Shining Path, a
violent leftist rebel group.
	   Peruvian officials say they believe Nunez took part in a 1992
car bombing that killed 21 people in the affluent Miraflores
section of Lima.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Plummeting oil prices are provoking
strikes, budget cuts, new debt and calls for a moratorium on
foreign debt payments in Venezuela.
	   Public sector doctors, court and oil industry workers all went
on strike this week, with teachers threatening to join them, too.
The government says the lowest oil prices in 12 years has left it
with no money for raises.
	   Officials said they will seek (dlrs) 800 million in loans from
World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, and issue
another (dlrs) 500 million in bonds on international markets in the
next two weeks.
	   They already have slashed (dlrs) 1.6 billion from this year's
budget.
	   Some critics said the government should freeze payments on the
foreign debt, which eats up 40 percent of the national budget, and
cut back on hefty military spending.
	   Newspaper columnist Alfredo Pena said in Friday's El Nacional
that despite the fiscal crisis, the Air Force is making (dlrs)
10,000-an-hour practice runs with F-16s for July 5 independence day
celebrations.
	   The drop in oil prices means Venezuela will take in (dlrs) 2.5
billion less than it planned, or 37 percent less than last year,
officials say. Oil accounts for three-fourths of the country's
exports.
	   Adding to the economic turmoil was the resignation on Tuesday of
Finance Minister Freddy Rojas Para. The new minister, Maritza
Izaguirre, is the fourth person to hold the post in the last five
years.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Amid bouyed peace expectations since
recent presidential elections, the United Nations has denied it is
seeking a role in negotiations to end Colombia's 34-year civil war.
	   ``I wish to clarify, that, contrary to press reports out of
Bogota, neither the secretary-general nor any authorized official
has proposed that the United Nations play a role in peace
negotiations in that country,'' a U.N. spokesperson said Thursday.
	   A local newspaper reported the United Nations would play a key
role in peace talks after President-elect Andres Pastrana met
Wednesday at U.N. headquarters in Bogota with influential
Colombians and top U.N. officials in the country.
	   Pastrana, who was elected June 21 and takes office in August,
has promised he'll seek direct talks with the country's two largest
rebel groups. Both have responded positively.
	   The National Liberation Army announced this week it would meet
in Germany on July 12 with Colombian civic and political leaders,
in talks that could pave the way for negotiations with Pastrana.
	   The United Nations moderated successfully peace talks ending
civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala, and many Colombians see a
similar U.N. role as likely in their country's conflict.

	   GLACIER, Washington (AP) _ On summit day, climbers on Mount
Baker leave their tents at midnight, brace themselves with ice
axes, kick their crampons into frozen snow, and light up the
darkness with their headlamps as they trudge upward, roped to the
climber ahead of them.
	   Just as climbers do on Mount Everest in the Himalayas.
	   For people who lack the Olympian endurance of a world-class
mountaineer, or the money it takes to climb Mount Everest, there is
10,778-foot (3,285-meter) Mount Baker, 90 miles (145 kilometers)
north of Seattle.
	   While climbers on Everest pay about dlrs 70,000 and spend three
months suffering through brutal cold and taking serious risks,
climbers on Mount Baker spend a fraction of that, and it takes less
than a week.
	   For those who do have aspirations to take on Everest, Mount
Baker is the ideal place to train.
	   ``You couldn't design a better mountain than Baker for training
Alpine climbing,'' says Dunham Gooding, founder of the American
Alpine Institute near Mount Baker. ``Although it doesn't have the
high altitude, it has all the features of the big mountains of the
world. We can expose people to all the skills they might need in
any of the world's Alpine environments.''
	   Climbing mountains has become popular in the last several years
among many physically active middle-class Americans. High-tech
advances in equipment and clothing are credited with fueling the
popularity of these adventure vacations.
	   Nonetheless, it's a dangerous pasttime.
	   Dramatic helicopter rescues on Mount McKinley and Mount Rainier
in June demonstrated the risk on the most popular mountains.
Avalanches on Mount Rainier and Oregon's Mount Hood killed two
climbers taking mountaineering classes this spring.
	   On 14,410-foot (4,392-meter) Mount Rainier, 200 miles (320
kilometers) south of Mount Baker, one man was killed and seven
other climbers were injured in an avalanche in early June. Still
about 8,000 people a year set out for Rainier's summit.
	   An avid backpacker most of her life, Deane Shokes of San
Francisco says she always yearned to try Alpine mountain climbing.
	   ``When I turned 50, I decided to do it. I figured I better quit
talking and start doing.''
	   After a week of learning the basics on Mount Baker in 1996 with
her grown daughter, Mary, the mother-daughter team climbed Mount
Rainier last summer and they are preparing to climb Glacier Peak
later this summer.
	   ``It's something I truly look forward to,'' she says.
	   The top North American peak to conquer, Alaska's 20,320-foot
(6,194-meter) Mount McKinley, had more than 1,000 climbers during
its short climbing season this spring. Thousands more are climbing
Oregon's 11,245-foot (3,427-meter) Mount Hood and California's
14,161-foot (4,316-meter) Mount Shasta.
	   Baker's moderate height and abundant glaciers contribute to the
popularity of the volcano. Altitude sickness is not much of a
factor here.
	   Because of its proximity to the Pacific Ocean and its stature as
the biggest mountain in the North Cascades, Mount Baker is in the
path of many winter storms that pile more and more snow on the
volcano's 12 glaciers covering 20 square miles (50 square
kilometers).
	   Mount Baker's glaciers come with menacing crevasses and seracs,
just like the bigger mountains. It also has a steaming volcanic
crater and spectacular views.
	   Though Mount Baker is subject to changeable weather during the
popular climbing season of June through August, the Pacific
Northwest volcano is largely free of the weather extremes of larger
mountains.
	   Several mountain guide services that offer climbs on the world's
biggest mountains operate ``schools'' on Mount Baker. In addition
to Gooding's American Alpine Institute, there are Mountain Madness
of Seattle, the National Outdoors Leadership School and Alpine
Ascents International.
	   There are a variety of courses: three-day summit climbs, six and
12-day Alpine climbing schools, ice-climbing schools, all-women
schools and preparation courses for Mount McKinley climbs. They
range in price from dlrs 800 to dlrs 1,500.
	   Kobey Connelly of Mountain Madness says his service has expanded
its Mount Baker seminars to meet the growing demand.
	   Gooding, who has guided climbs on mountains all over the world,
says, ``The two best places to learn Alpine skills are Mount Baker
and the Alps.''
	   Climbers on Mount Baker wear the same plastic boots and
crampons, use the same ice axes and ropes and tie the same knots
that climbers must use on bigger mountains. And they melt snow for
cooking and drinking water.
	   They experience the midnight ``Alpine start'' on summit day and
they experience that sense of danger that comes with every step on
big mountains.
	   Near the summit, climbers are treated to a rest break at Mount
Baker's steamy volcanic crater, stinking of sulfur. Mount Baker
last erupted in 1880.
	   It is not all glorious sunsets and majestic scenery, though.
	   Climbers must carry heavy packs uphill mile after mile
(kilometer after kilometer), spend day after day in the same
underwear and often share a small tent with a stranger who snores.
In addition to getting wet and cold, all climbers must sign that
ominous legal release acknowledging the danger.
	   After a week on Mount Baker, climbers will know whether they
have the passion to try bigger, more difficult and more expensive
mountains.
	   ``People get a little taste of climbing and typically they get
hooked,'' Gooding says. ``There is no dabbling in it like some
other sports.''

	   ENFIELD, New Hampshire (AP) _ Typically, people catch glimpses
of life in the past by glancing into carefully restored buildings
that have become museums. Usually, the glances are from hallways,
over restraining ropes, next to signs that say ``Don't touch.''
	   But in Enfield, people not only can touch history, they can
sleep it, eat it and store their clothes in it.
	   With a corporate partner, the Enfield Shaker Museum has restored
the Great Stone Dwelling, a massive, 160-year-old granite structure
on Mascoma Lake, as an inn and museum. The inn opened for guests
June 6.
	   The purpose of the renovations is not to modernize the imposing
structure. Renovators have been peeling away attempts at
modernization from the last seven decades, restoring the building
and the features painstakingly built in by the Shakers.
	   ``It's like seeing history come to life again,'' says Sarah
Shaffer, director of the Enfield Shaker Museum.
	   Guests can hang their jackets and hats on Shaker peg rails that
line the walls of every room, or tuck their clothing into the
hundreds of trademark drawers built into the walls. In the Shaker
dining hall, they can take their meals prepared with herbs grown in
the garden right outside.
	   Completed in 1841, the six-story building, with its 200 windows
and towering cupola, was the centerpiece of the Shaker Village that
prospered on the lake's western shore from the late 1700s to the
1920s.
	   ``It is just about the most spectacular, most famous of all
Shaker buildings ever constructed and was probably their greatest
engineering feat,'' says Don Leavitt, who runs the inn with partner
Rick Miller as part of Historic Inns of New England.
	   ``You can imagine in 1841, when everyone lived in little hovels,
to come along the lake and see this magnificent structure, how it
would have struck you,'' Leavitt says.
	   In 1843, it left visitor Giles Avery in awe.
	   ``O! what a stone palace,'' he wrote in his journal, calling it
``one of the most stately, magnificent and solid buildings I ever
saw.''
	   About 100 of the village's 300 Shakers lived there.
	   The Shakers were a Protestant religious order that created 19
communities in America, beginning in 1774, when a handful of
``Shaking Quakers'' emigrated to escape religious persecution in
England.
	   They believed in celibacy, equality of the sexes and confession
of sins, and are known for inventing many labor-saving, practical
devices such as the washing machine, clothespin, flat broom and
circular saw. They also made simple furniture, reproductions of
which fill the inn.
	   Workers have restored ``sleeping chambers'' on the second, third
and fourth floors. The museum plans exhibits on the fifth and
sixth, similar to the Shaker Village in Pleasant Hill, Kentucky,
where guest rooms are interspersed with exhibits.
	   Over the years, built-in drawers and shutters were removed from
some rooms, but rather than covering the spaces, Leavitt says the
museum and inn will use them as exhibits.
	   ``We'll have some kind of interpretive description on the wall
to describe what was here and what will be coming back, to get the
guests involved in the ongoing restoration project,'' Leavitt says.
	   Workers have found original sky-blue paint on walls behind the
drawers. Others found drawers after pulling linoleum off a wall.
And in one large meeting room, pegs in the floor mark where Shakers
lined up for their joyous marching and dancing. In fact, they got
their name from outsiders who saw the whirling, dancing and
trembling forms of worship.
	   The Shakers sold their Enfield property to an order of Catholic
priests and brothers who established a seminary and boys' school in
1927.
	   In 1985, the property was sold to a developer and the Great
Stone Dwelling became an inn. After the developer went bankrupt in
1994, the inn sat idle.
	   An intense fundraising effort last winter enabled the Enfield
Shaker Museum to buy the building and its adjacent chapel. It is
leasing the inn to Leavitt and Miller.
	   Other Shakers lived in Canterbury, about 50 scenic miles (80
kilometres) away, where their largely intact village is a tourist
attraction and educational site.
	   Residents of the two villages visited each other often, and
their leaders often lived half a year in each village.
	   They traveled a route that soon might carry more visitors to
both sites.
	   ``We're talking to Canterbury about designing a driving tour
that goes between the two, with a historical narrative describing
what you are seeing,'' Leavitt said. ``Our guests would stay here,
tour the museum here and then go over to Canterbury.''
	   The Canterbury village is considering opening a small inn in a
building where the Shakers once lodged visitors. It also is
restoring its own dwelling house, built in 1793 and expanded five
times through 1837, the year Enfield began work on the Great Stone
Dwelling.

Junta names new No. 2 man in Nigeria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS material to ADD second appointment. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The Nigerian junta named a new chief of
general staff Friday to replace the general who had previously held
what is effectively the country's No. 2 position _ but was
sentenced to death for allegedly plotting a coup.
	   Gen. Oladipyo Diya, once the right-hand man to Nigeria's late
dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, was sentenced to death in April along
with five other people for the alleged December plot.
	   On Friday, Rear Adm. Mike Akhigbe, the chief of naval staff, was
named to replace Diya. Akhigbe notably is a Christian from southern
Nigeria, promoted in a military that is overwhelmingly made up of
Muslim Northerners.
	   The junta also named Air Vice Marshall A.M. Dagash as the
country's new chief of defense staff. He replaces Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar, who became Nigeria's head of state following Abacha's
death last month.
	   Abubakar has moved to distance himself from his predecessor's
harsh policies, and the appointment of Akhigbe across ethnic and
religious lines may reflect his willingness to reach out beyond
Abacha's core military constituency.
	   However, it may also indicate that Nigeria's military intends to
remain in power beyond Oct. 1, the date the country is supposed to
be returned to civilian rule.
	   The transition schedule was created by Abacha, but Abubakar has
vowed to proceed with it.
	   The junta has yet to say whether it will carry out the death
sentence handed down against Diya.

Take your medicine before you travel to avoid motion sickness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Once you're on the road, in the air or out at
sea, it's too late to take your motion sickness medicine, doctors
say.
	   ``One of the side effects of motion sickness is decreased
absorption in the stomach,'' says Dr. Wayne J. Riley, director of
the Travel Medicine Service at Baylor College of Medicine. ``So
oral drugs taken after the onset of symptoms are usually not very
effective.''
	   Motion sickness can cause vomiting, paleness, cold sweats,
hyperventilation and headaches.
	   Riley says over-the-counter antihistamines can help reduce the
discomfort of motion sickness if taken two hours before traveling.
Medicated patches containing scopolumine can prevent motion
sickness if applied behind the ear eight hours before travel. The
patches are available by prescription only.
	   If you are susceptible to motion sickness, Riley advises that
you avoid eating heavy meals for at least two hours before
traveling and then eat light, easily digestible foods, such as
crackers, bread and canned fruit.
	   Also, don't read in the car or on a plane, train or boat when
it's in motion.
	   When traveling long distances by car, he suggests, sit in the
front seat and focus your eyes on the horizon. This stable
reference can help minimize the effect of changes in the inner ear,
which controls the sense of balance and plays a role in motion
sickness.

 &UR; Thailand asks Muslim neighbors to help develop Islamic tourism
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand has asked Malaysia and
Indonesia to help develop Islamic tourism facilities to attract
visitors from the Middle East.
	   Malaysia and Indonesia are both predominantly Islamic countries
and Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population. Thailand's
population is 90 percent Buddhist, although the country's four
southernmost provinces have Muslim majorities. All three countries
are tolerant of other religions.
	   The Tourism Authority of Thailand said help was sought from the
country's neighbors since they are ``more experienced in catering
to'' Islamic markets.
	   The authority's aim is to provide Muslim visitors with
facilities and arrangements in accord with their religion's rules.
They would include dietary and living arrangements.
	   Prince of Songkhla University in southern Thailand _ the only
university in the country that has an Islamic studies program _
will certify food as halal, meaning it has been prepared according
to Muslim rules. The major Muslim dietary restriction is a ban on
eating pork.
	   Thailand made the request at the recent meeting of the
Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle working group on
tourism, held in Kedah, Malaysia.

 &UR; Norman Rockwell's art on display at Mark Twain museum
	   HANNIBAL, Missouri (AP) _ The most popular exhibit at the New
Mark Twain Museum these days has nothing to do with the author,
Hannibal's favorite son.
	   All 322 of Norman Rockwell's Saturday Evening Post covers are on
display at the museum, which opened in April. The exhibit runs
through Aug. 15.
	   The Rockwell exhibit is the highlight of the new dlrs 1.8
million museum, the sixth downtown museum dedicated to Twain. About
100,000 people visit the museums each year, curator Henry Sweets
said.
	   Twain spent his boyhood here and used the town and its
characters as the inspiration for such works as ``The Adventures of
Tom Sawyer'' and ``Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.''
	   The Rockwell exhibit has been displayed outside the Norman
Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, just five times _
and never in the Midwest.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MEMPHIS, Tennessee (AP) _ A new company that provides one-stop
shopping for access to more than 10,000 privately owned and fully
furnished vacation rental homes and condominiums says there is
still a good selection at some premier resort destinations.
	   Those destinations include Hawaii, Aspen, Colorado, Park City,
Utah, and Sanibel Island, Florida.
	   By accessing ResortQuest International's Web site, travelers can
also find up-to-the-minute travel specials and package deals, such
as a 15 percent summer discount on lodging in Breckenridge,
Colorado, seven-day golf packages starting at dlrs 495 in
Scottsdale, Arizona, and special rates on mountain condominium
lodging in Whistler, British Columbia.

	   PETOSKEY, Michigan (AP) _ Golf business and course construction
are booming in Michigan. The state has more public and resort
courses (763) than any other state and has led the nation in new
course openings the last three years, according to the National
Golf Foundation in Jupiter, Florida.
	   Golf magazine senior editor Brian McCallen says, ``It's hard to
know whether the public will ever grasp that this limited-season
state is outpacing a place like Florida for new course
development.''
	   Outside Michigan, the state's reputation as a golf mecca is a
well-kept secret. Only 4 percent of those who play here live in
distant states such as Arizona, California or the Carolinas, the
Michigan tourism agency estimates.
	   So the state is in the midst of a campaign to earn a national
image as a golfer's paradise _ particularly in the summer when
popular Southern resorts get uncomfortably hot. The 2-year-old
campaign bills Michigan as ``America's summer golf capital.''
	   But more is at stake than bragging rights.
	   Travel Michigan, the state tourism agency, reported last
November that golfers pump dlrs 941 million a year into the state
economy.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It has stood for a half-century as the ultimate
eye-of-the-beholder symbol, a Times Square magnet for patriots,
protesters, pigeons: the U.S. Armed Forces Recruiting Station.
	   ``The Booth,'' as it's known among the ``Be all that you can
be'' brigade, gets the boot this summer after serving ``Uncle Sam''
through three wars as the military's most prominent Manhattan
outpost.
	   The military isn't abandoning seamy old Times Square; it's
simply surrendering to the Disneyfication that is transforming the
neighborhood. It's exchanging its squat, cramped steel and glass
box for a dlrs 1.5 million, high-tech, neon-encrusted ``recruiting
center'' that seems more in line with ``Star Wars'' than real wars.
	   Bolted onto the steel grates of a triangular Broadway traffic
island, the humble booth evolved over the years into a powerful
icon of ... well, just about everything.
	   ``A symbol of service and sacrifice,'' said Michael Handy, head
of the mayor's office of veterans' affairs.
	   ``A piece of Americana,'' said Peter Shugert of the Army Corps
of Engineers, which will dismantle the structure.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Julien, a 20-year-old U.S. university student, has
spent five days parading around the 12th World AIDS Conference as a
walking condom. Posters that greet delegates urge men to ``protect
your jewels.'' The halls abound with free condoms _ 30,000 of them.
	   While the latex sheaths embarrassed some and angered others,
most of the 13,000 conference participants welcome them as a key
weapon in the global battle to prevent the spread of AIDS.
	   Julien wore dark sunglasses and a head-to-toe green-yellow
fabric sheath, with slits for eyes and the title ``Mr. Lover Man''
emblazoned near the waist. He was one of several ``human
contraceptives'' cruising the conference halls.
	   At one booth, condoms exploded with a bang every few minutes.
Official conference condom supplier Durex was showing just how
strong their products are, by filling them with air until they
burst.
	   Durex also gave away 30,000 free condoms, according to
spokeswoman Lucinda Ostwind. The company also organized the walking
condoms.
	   ``We have had a phenomenal response to the free condoms,''
Ostwind said. ``When people's optimism about finding a cure (for
AIDS) begins to waver, prevention is what they fall back on.''
	   Ostwind says the walking condoms have upset a few delegates, but
brought a smile to the faces of most.
	   ``Most seem to be open-minded about it and think it's a bit of
fun,'' she said.
	   More than 13,000 researchers, physicians, government ministers,
activists, journalists and others have taken part in the
conference. Meetings have addressed subjects from the development
of an effective anti-AIDS vaccine to prevention of infection
through protected sex.
	   Julien, a French-Brazilian citizen who would not give his last
name, volunteers with for Population Services International, a
non-profit health group based in Washington.
	   ``Everyone's open at this conference,'' he said. ``There's a
really liberated atmosphere.''
	   He wasn't the only one in condom-wear.
	   ``Today, we're safe in rubber,'' proclaimed volunteer Melvin
Mortensen, a 32-year-old Dane attired in a white latex dress, pink
sash, long false eyelashes and a hat covered in white inflated
condoms.
	   Mortenson was extolling the virtues of safe sex at the
conference as part of a three-month tour of Europe with the Safer
Sex Caravan, an AIDS/HIV project sponsored by Danish health
authorities and the European Union.

Nine Days: A Clinton scrapbook from China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SANDRA SOBIERAJ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton strode a red carpet
at Tiananmen Square, then called the murderous 1989 crackdown
tragic and wrong. He asked Americans to remember their own flawed
history and ``respect the enormous challenges China has faced in
trying to move forward.''
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin's rebuttal on Tiananmen was
unapologetic: Without the People's Liberation Army's ``resolute
measures,'' China would not enjoy stability now.
	   Clinton totes home a souvenir terra cotta warrior head and
snapshots of himself appearing uncensored on Chinese talk radio and
with Jiang on state TV. But there are no photos of the president
with Chinese dissidents or human rights activists.
	   Did his nine days in China _ no matter how warm the handshakes,
how awesome the sights _ salve nine years of American hurt over
Tiananmen or pry loose 49 years of communist repression?
	   U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California sniffed that any buzz about
Clinton making a breakthrough on human rights ``demonstrates just
how low the expectations were for this trip.''
	   Clinton countered that democracy activists in Hong Kong said the
mere fact that his exchange with Jiang was broadcast across China
``might have a bigger impact over the long run on the human rights
picture than anything else that happened here.''
	   Other highlights of Clinton's China scrapbook:
 &UR; FREE EXPRESSION:
	   Clinton called it the biggest surprise of his trip _ the wide
and uncensored broadcast on government-controlled media of his news
conference with Jiang, his speech at Peking University and a full
hour of call-in chat on Shanghai People's Radio. ``I did not
anticipate being able to have that sort of open, sweeping
communication with the Chinese people,'' Clinton beamed.
	   David Brown, senior associate at the Asia Pacific Policy Center
in Washington, said the press conference was more remarkable to the
Chinese, only the second time one of their leaders allowed himself
to be publicly questioned.
 &UR; WEAPONS TECHNOLOGY:
	   Clinton won a symbolic agreement for China and the United States
to no longer aim nuclear missiles at each other, though they can be
retargeted in a matter of minutes. Clinton called the pact a symbol
of growing U.S.-China friendship and said ``it should make other
countries in the Asia Pacific region relax a little.''
	   He acknowledged defeat in not getting a Chinese commitment to
join the worldwide system that prevents the exportation of
dangerous missile technology, especially to unstable Third World
nations.
 &UR; RELIGIOUS FREEDOM:
	   Clinton worshipped at one of Beijing's eight
government-sanctioned Protestant churches, calling Chinese and
Americans ``brothers and sisters as children of God.'' First lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Secretaryof State Madeleine Albright
gave their stamp of approval at a newly restored synagogue in
Shanghai. Clinton and Jiang agreed to encourage exchanges among
government officials and religious leaders.
 &UR; TRADE:
	   Administration negotiators tried for months but failed to make
headway on easing trade barriers that limit U.S. access to China's
markets and add to the dlrs 50-billion-and-growing annual trade
deficit. Without market-access agreements, the United States will
not permit China's membership in the World Trade Organization.
 &UR; TAIWAN:
	   Jiang called the Taiwan question ``most important ... in the
interest of a smooth growth of China-U.S. relations.'' Clinton
stunned Taiwan by publicly endorsing China's opposition to Taiwan
independence.
	   U.S. diplomats had long made clear the administration does not
support Taiwan's membership in organizations such as the United
Nations and World Health Organization, which require statehood, but
Clinton's pronouncement, standing at Jiang's side, was a public
message that ``should have been delivered in Taipei, not Beijing,''
said Brown, of the Asia Pacific Policy Center.
 &UR; DALAI LAMA:
	   Teased by Clinton that Tibet is a cultural treasure and the
Dalai Lama a likable fellow, Jiang opened the door to talks with
the exiled religious leader _ as long as he publicly acknowledges
Tibet is ``an inalienable part of China'' and Taiwan is a Chinese
province. Official China had previously taken a position of
hostility toward the popular Dalai Lama.

Suspicious Catholics say they will block Portadown's Garvaghy Road
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Determined to prevent a
traditional Protestant parade from going through their
neighborhood, Catholic protesters have made plans to block the
disputed roadway 24 hours before the Orange Order's annual march in
Portadown.
	   British soldiers and Northern Ireland's police force were
already patrolling the predominantly Protestant town in strength in
anticipation of blocking the Orange march Sunday before it reaches
the Catholic homes along Garvaghy Road.
	   But protest leader Breandan MacCionnaith said locals, who didn't
trust the British security forces to defend their interests, would
begin a round-the-clock human blockade starting about midday
(1100GMT).
	   Details emerged early Saturday of intensive but unsuccessful
shuttle diplomacy between MacCionnaith's Garvaghy Road Residents
Coalition and the Portadown leaders of the Orange Order, Northern
Ireland's biggest Protestant fraternal group, involving
intermediaries and senior politicians.
	   Orangemen have refused to negotiate directly with MacCionnaith
since he started organizing opposition to their annual parade in
1995. The resulting showdowns that have raised sectarian passions
across Northern Ireland and provoked widespread violence for the
past two summers.
	   The newly elected first minister of Northern Ireland's
cross-community Assembly, Ulster Unionist Party leader David
Trimble, said he tried negotiating ``at long distance'' with
MacCionnaith, who ``has proved to be totally intransigent, saying
no to every reasonable suggestion that was made.''
	   Trimble, an Orangeman himself who was elected Ulster Unionist
leader after championing the right of Protestants to march down
Garvaghy Road in 1995, offered no detail of what offers the
Orangemen might have made.
	   But their bottom line is that the parade must be permitted in
some form Sunday, otherwise they will camp out at the spot where
they're likely to be blocked _ the Drumcree Anglican church on a
hill overlooking Portadown _ until they get their way.
	   MacCionnaith said he had made an offer to Trimble's confidential
emissary: Garvaghy Road residents would consider allowing Orangemen
to march in 1999 if the Orangemen backed off now and got into
direct negotiations. But this suggestion was rejected as impossible
to sell, he said.
	   ``If the Orange Order had responded and had rerouted voluntarily
on Sunday ... it would have transformed the situation,''
MacCionnaith said. ``And I think there could have been steps taken
to ensure some form of Orange presence on the Garvaghy Road at some
time in the future.''
	   Orange leaders have shunned MacCionnaith on the grounds that he
served a sentence connected to an Irish Republican Army bomb attack
on Portadown in the 1970s, and is seen to be pursuing the same
agenda as their enemies in the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party.
	   And Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams emphasized that the Orangemen
must talk directly with MacCionnaith if they want to find a
solution. He has pressed the same argument for years with Trimble,
who refuses to talk to Adams and whose Ulster Unionist Party is
formally linked with the Orange Order.
	   ``This is an issue of rights, an issue of equality,'' Adams
said. ``The Orange march on the Garvaghy Road is not about
religious tolerance, but about intolerance. It is about domination
by unionism and Orangeism over (Irish Catholic) nationalism.''

Holbrooke pressing ahead with peace efforts; Serbs regain control

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke is
pressing ahead with efforts to broker a cease-fire in secessionist
Kosovo province, where Serb forces have retaken a strategic town
that he believed would be a flashpoint for a wider Balkan war.
	   Holbrooke will travel Saturday to the provincial capital of
Pristina to meet with moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and
other ethnic Albanians. During a visit last month, Holbrooke tried
to get the militant Kosovo Liberation Army to end the siege of the
strategic town of Kijevo, fearing Serb forces would use massive
force against it and spark a wider war in the region.
	   Holbrooke, nominated to be America's next ambassador to the
United Nations, had said the standoff between Serbs and Albanians
in Kijevo made the village the ``most dangerous place in Europe.''
	   The Serb retaking of the Kijevo on Friday, which freed 100 Serb
villagers and 50 policemen held by the rebels, could signal a
turning point, allowing the stalled negotiations to go forward.
	   Ethnic Albanian separatists want independence for Kosovo, a
province in southern Serbia where they outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
Serbia is the largest of two republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo since Serb forces stepped up
efforts to crush militant resistance in late February.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic says the crackdown is
aimed at Albanian terrorists who have targeted Serb police in their
fight for independence.
	   Sitting astride the main east-west road in Kosovo, Kijevo has
been a flashpoint since the KLA surrounded it in mid-June and cut
off its Serb inhabitants. Serb police then surrounded the KLA
fighters.
	   While in Kosovo, Holbrooke said he will confer with Rugova, whom
he described as ``the main leader'' of the province's Albanian
majority, to ``get his advice on how to proceed.''
	   That could include the role of the militant KLA, which the Serbs
consider a terrorist organization but which has been gaining
support in Kosovo at the expense of Rugova, who opposes violence.
	   The United States has urged the KLA to recognize Rugova as the
head of a joint delegation if negotiations can be started.
	   Asked Saturday if the KLA should be included in talks, Holbrooke
said Washington wanted ``everybody who has a legitimate role in the
destiny of Kosovo'' to have a place in the negotiations. ``But how
that works out remains to be seen,'' he said.
	   Serb police entered Kijevo shortly after dawn, breaking the
ethnic Albanian rebels' hold and fulfilling what was believed to be
Milosevic's remaining goal in his latest crackdown on Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke, who arrived Friday in Belgrade, talked with Milosevic
until early Saturday. He refused to say whether his talks with
Milosevic made progress. Holbrooke is expected to shuttle back to
Belgrade after his meetings in Kosovo.
	   On the eve of Holbrooke's visit, Milosevic denied any government
repression in Kosovo and offered to restore the autonomy he yanked
from the province in 1989 on grounds of protecting its Serb
minority.
	   Holbrooke is pressing for a cease-fire before trying to get
Milosevic to withdraw his forces. But he and other Western
officials are insistent that Kosovo should not be allowed
independence.
	   That may not satisfy even the moderate Albanian leaders on whom
Washington had pinned hopes for a negotiated settlement.
	   On Friday, Rugova said autonomy ``is not a solution'' for the
province.
	   ``Our aim is an independent, neutral Kosovo with equal rights
for all,'' Rugova told reporters. Noting that other parts of
Yugoslavia had broken away and gained independence, Rugova said
``it is our right to demand independence.''

	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Canadian forest-products company
Abitibi-Consolidated confirmed Friday that it and a Norwegian
company are in discussions with Hansol Paper, the largest pulp and
paper producer in Korea.
	   The joint venture with Norske Skog, which like Abitibi is one of
the largest newsprint producers in the world, would aim at buying
all or part of Hansol.
	   No definitive agreements have been signed yet, said Michael
Medline, a senior vice president at Abitibi.
	   It would be Abitibi's first production venture in Asia. Its only
other facility outside North America is in England.
	   Abitibi, the largest newsprint maker in the world, is currently
in a labor conflict, with 11 of its 17 North American mills shut by
a strike since June 15.

West African ministers pledge help to Guinea-Bissau president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Condemning the military mutiny in
Guinea-Bissau, ministers of foreign affairs and defense from across
West Africa on Saturday vowed to reassert the authority of that
country's embattled president through a combination of
negotiations, sanctions and the use of force.
	   But the ministers from the 16-member Economic Community of West
African States, or ECOWAS, gave no details on what kind of of
sanctions or force would be used.
	   Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi, who chaired the meeting,
said only that military decisions would ``depend on the
circumstances on the ground.''
	   He gave a similar answer when pressed on the sanctions and
embargo enforcement that would be employed.
	   A communique issued at the end of the meeting said that the
mandate of ECOMOG, the economic community's military wing, would be
extended to cover Guinea-Bissau, calling on member states to
contribute additional soldiers to the force.
	   The group also called on humanitarian agencies to help avert
suffering among civilians in Guinea-Bissau.
	   Already, hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to
flee their homes in the battle-torn country.
	   Fighting began in Guinea-Bissau on June 7, with a coup attempt
in the capital, Bissau, by former army chief of staff Brig.
Ansumane Mane, who accuses Vieira of corruption and says he should
resign.
	   The fighting later spread to the interior of former Portuguese
colony and appears to be escalating into a civil war.
	   Talks to try to end the fighting have so far gone nowhere.
	   Vieira has asked for ECOMOG assistance.
	   Typically led by Nigeria, ECOMOG peacekeeping and intervention
forces have intervened to stop fighting in recent years in Sierra
Leone and Liberia.
	   The ministers established a group of seven nations to ensure
implementation of their decisions. The group will meet next on July
14 in Abuja, Nigeria.

World Cup: Laudrup's glittering career ends against Brazil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Even though Denmark lost, Michael Laudrup
felt his glittering career could not have ended much better.
	   ``It was a great experience, a great way to finish my career,''
Laudrup said after the Danes lost a memorable quarterfinal 3-2
Friday to defending World Cup champion Brazil that many thought was
the best game of the tournament so far.
	   ``I haven't realized that my career is over now,'' he said. ``It
will take some time ... But it was great propaganda for Danish
football tonight.''
	   Laudrup, 34, one of Europe's top soccer players in the past 15
years, is the only player ever to win league titles for (European)
powerhouses Juventus, Barcelona, Real Madrid and his last one with
Ajax this season.
	   He was the only remaining player from the Danish 1986 team in
Mexico, which beat Scotland, Uruguay and eventual finalist Germany
before crashing out 5-1 to Spain in Denmark's only previous World
Cup appearance.
	   After an emotional goodbye on La Beaujoire stadium's field in
Nantes _ at least half a dozen Danes threw their jerseys to their
own loyal fans in the stands instead of swapping with the
Brazilians _ Laudrup was the last player to leave the locker-room.
	   Any regrets of leaving soccer?
	   ``No way,'' he said. ``In only three weeks a lot of players will
gather for training camps with their club teams. Just imagine doing
that again, training twice a day! But it was OK for the World Cup,
of course.''
	   Laudrup, Denmark's most famous striker ever, is unique in many
ways.
	   Ajax tried to sign him when he was a 13-year-old wonder boy.
``No thanks, too early,'' said his dad Finn, a former Danish
national team player with foreign experience in the Austrian
league.
	   After the Dutch side failed to sign Laudrup at age 13, he
started his career in his native Denmark with Brondby, the first
team to be listed on the Danish stock exchange.
	   After a stint with FC Copenhagen, Laudrup went to Juventus in
1983. He had a spell on loan to Lazio in Rome for two seasons
before returning to ``Juve'' and winning the '86 league title
alongside Michel Platini.
	   In Spain, Laudrup became a league champion four straight times
(1991-94) with Barcelona before leaving for rival Real Madrid,
where he won a fifth straight title in 1995. After a year in Japan
with Vissel Kobe, he returned to Europe and Ajax, capping it with
the recent Dutch double (league and cup).
	   In the early 90s, both Michael and his younger brother Brian
refused to play for their country at one point under former coach
Richard Moller Nielsen. Only Brian played in the 1992 European
Championship finals in Sweden, where Denmark upset Germany 2-0 in
the final for its only major international triumph.
	   Encouraged by new Swedish coach Bo Johansson's less rigid
approach to tactics, the Laudrup brothers were back to their best
in France '98.
	   Brian Laudrup, who scored one goal as Denmark beat Nigeria 4-1
Sunday to reach the quarterfinals for the first time, set up Martin
Jorgensen's opening goal with only two minutes gone Friday and
notched the equalizer 2-2 early in the second half.
	   After ending his remarkable career, Laudrup will return to
Denmark with his family.

	   Laudrup, 34, one of Europe's top soccer players in the past 15
years, is the only player ever to win league titles for (European)
powerhouses Juventus, Barcelona, Real Madrid and his last one with
Ajax this season.
	   He was the only remaining player from the Danish 1986 team in
Mexico, which beat Scotland, Uruguay and eventual finalist Germany
before crashing out 5-1 to Spain in Denmark's only previous World
Cup appearance.
	   After an emotional goodbye on La Beaujoire stadium's field in
Nantes _ at least half a dozen Danes threw their jerseys to their
own loyal fans in the stands instead of swapping with the
Brazilians _ Laudrup was the last player to leave the locker-room.
	   Any regrets of leaving soccer?
	   ``No way,'' he said. ``In only three weeks a lot of players will
gather for training camps with their club teams. Just imagine doing
that again, training twice a day! But it was OK for the World Cup,
of course.''
	   Laudrup, Denmark's most famous striker ever, is unique in many
ways.
	   Ajax tried to sign him when he was a 13-year-old wonder boy.
``No thanks, too early,'' said his dad Finn, a former Danish
national team player with foreign experience in the Austrian
league.
	   After the Dutch side failed to sign Laudrup at age 13, he
started his career in his native Denmark with Brondby, the first
team to be listed on the Danish stock exchange.
	   After a stint with FC Copenhagen, Laudrup went to Juventus in
1983. He had a spell on loan to Lazio in Rome for two seasons
before returning to ``Juve'' and winning the '86 league title
alongside Michel Platini.
	   In Spain, Laudrup became a league champion four straight times
(1991-94) with Barcelona before leaving for rival Real Madrid,
where he won a fifth straight title in 1995. After a year in Japan
with Vissel Kobe, he returned to Europe and Ajax, capping it with
the recent Dutch double (league and cup).
	   In the early 90s, both Michael and his younger brother Brian
refused to play for their country at one point under former coach
Richard Moller Nielsen. Only Brian played in the 1992 European
Championship finals in Sweden, where Denmark upset Germany 2-0 in
the final for its only major international triumph.
	   Encouraged by new Swedish coach Bo Johansson's less rigid
approach to tactics, the Laudrup brothers were back to their best
in France '98.
	   Brian Laudrup, who scored one goal as Denmark beat Nigeria 4-1
Sunday to reach the quarterfinals for the first time, set up Martin
Jorgensen's opening goal with only two minutes gone Friday and
notched the equalizer 2-2 early in the second half.
	   After ending his remarkable career, Laudrup will return to
Denmark with his family.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Tyler Houston homered twice and drove in five
runs, and the Chicago Cubs beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 12-9 Friday
for their fourth win in five games.
	   Henry Rodriguez and Jose Hernandez added solo shots, and Kevin
Tapani won for the first time since June 6, stopping his three-game
losing streak. He allowed seven runs _ six earned _ and 10 hits in
eight-plus innings, striking out eight and walking one. Rod Beck
got one out for his 21st save.
	   Francisco Cordova (6-7), who hasn't won since May 31, lost his
fourth straight decision, giving up eight runs and eight hits in
three innings.
 &UR; Reds 6, Cardinals 3 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Reggie Sanders homered and had three RBIs as
Cincinnati beat St. Louis for its seventh victory in eight games.
	   Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire thrilled more than 10,000 fans
who showed up for batting practice by clearing the wall on 13 of 21
swings, but got to swing the bat only once during the game and flew
out. He is tied with Reggie Jackson for most homers before the
All-Star break at 37.
	   Mike Remlinger (5-9) walked McGwire twice and also hit him. Jeff
Shaw finished for his 23rd save. Todd Stottlemyre (9-6) lost for
the first time since June 1.
 &UR; Phillies 2, Brewers 0 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Curt Schilling added five strikeouts to his
major league-leading total and Doug Glanville had a two-run single
in the second as Philadelphia beat Milwaukee.
	   Schilling (8-8), who allowed five hits in seven innings, has 180
strikeouts in 19 starts, ahead of Nolan Ryan's pace when he set the
major league mark of 383 in 1973. Ryan had 179 strikeouts after 19
starts.
	   Mark Leiter got the final out for his 16th save. Scott Karl
(6-4) was the loser, allowing six hits and two runs in six
innings.
 &UR; Expos 8, Marlins 4 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Shane Andrews homered and drove in three runs, and
Orlando Cabrera also had three RBIs in Montreal's victory over
Florida.
	   Javier Vazquez (3-6) went 6 2/3 innings for his second straight
victory following a 10-start winless drought. He allowed four runs
and eight hits.
	   Craig Counsell homered for the Marlins.
	   Jose Sanchez (3-6) took the loss.
 &UR; Braves 3, Mets 2 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, Tom Glavine became the second 12-game winner in the
majors, surviving early trouble to pitch Atlanta past New York.
	   The Braves have won six straight to push their lead in the NL
East to a season-high 10 1/2 games over the Mets.
	   Glavine (12-3) allowed eight hits in seven innings to join
teammate Greg Maddux in the dozen-victory club. Glavine also had
two hits. Kerry Ligtenberg worked the final inning for his ninth
save.
	   Brian Bohanon (2-4) took the loss.

Pak steady, Lopez has worst Open round of career

	   KOHLER, Wisconsin (AP) _ Rookie Se Ri Pak says Blackwolf Run
Golf Course is so mentally demanding that it is making her head
spin.
	   Save the aspirin, though, for the rest of the field in the 53rd
U.S. Women's Open.
	   Pak continued to tame the menacing Pete Dye-designed course that
crushed the likes of Nancy Lopez and Meg Mallon in the second round
of the Open on Friday.
	   A 1-under-par 70 put Pak at 3-under 139 halfway through the
biggest event in women's golf, one stroke ahead of Liselotte
Neumann, the 1988 Open winner, who also shot a 70.
	   ``I don't think she is going to be too nervous,'' Neumann said
of Pak. ``She has nothing really to lose. She is having a good year
and a long career in front of her.''
	   Pak indeed is calm, collected and confident.
	   ``I really enjoy playing this course. I'm thinking a lot. This
course requires more thinking, more smart play,'' Pak said.
	   ``Too many headaches,'' she added with a laugh.
	   The 20-year-old from South Korea, who won the McDonald's LPGA
Championship in May, is seeking to become the first woman to win
two majors in her rookie year since Juli Inkster in 1984.
	   Because of high scores, slow play and a 51-minute lightning
delay, not everybody finished the round.
	   Darkness suspended play with 21 golfers still on the course, but
amateur Brenda Corrie Kuehn elected to finish the 18th hole, which
she bogeyed, finishing at 1-over for the day and even-par for the
tournament.
	   The 36-hole cut won't be determined until Saturday morning. The
60 lowest scores and ties and anyone within 10 strokes of the lead
will make the cut.
	   Lopez won't be one of them.
	   She and her playing partners, Mallon and Jane Geddes, were so
deflated by their play that they approached the 18th green Friday
waving white towels from their putters.
	   Lopez's 83 was the worst of her 81 career Open rounds and left
her at 18-over 160. Mallon shot a 76 for 153, Geddes a 79 for 157.
	   Blackwolf Run got the best of them _ and many others.
	   Kim Williams, who shared the first-round lead with Laura Davies
at 3-under, stumbled to a 10-over 81 for a two-day total of 149.
Davies had a 75 and, at 143, was four strokes off the lead.
	   Annika Sorenstam of Sweden, the 1995 and 1996 Open winner, had a
75 for 146, 10 strokes better than defending champion Alison
Nicholas of England, whose second straight 78 meant she wouldn't be
around for the final two rounds.
	   Not everybody had trouble Friday.
	   Dottie Pepper duplicated her 71 to reach the halfway point at
even par. Mhairi McKay and Chris Johnson shot 70s to put them at
even.
	   And three-time Open winner Hollis Stacy, playing in a
record-tying 29th straight Open, followed a 76 on Thursday with a
3-under 68 for 144.
	   With wind whipping off Lake Michigan and a few pins tucked
behind bunkers, second-day scores soared on the unyielding
6,412-yard (5,861-meter), par-71 layout.
	   Lisa Walters, penalized two strokes for slow play on Thursday,
responded with a 70 on Friday and was at 146, seven shots off the
lead.
	   Even though darkness forced the second round to be completed
Saturday morning, Lopez knew early that her Open was over. Yet the
gallery at 18 cheered her as if she was leader.
	   Lopez has finished second in the Open four times, including last
year, when she lost by a shot to Alison Nicholas in a dramatic
finish at Pumpkin Ridge.
	   Lopez, who began the day at 6-over-par 77, misfired on the first
hole, hitting a woman fan in the face. She parred the first four
holes before running into a string of bad luck that lasted an
excruciating eight holes and more than two hours.
	   Williams had three bogeys and a double bogey on her first seven
holes on the layout renowned for greens so fast that men's two-time
Open champion Ernie Els suggested the women practice by putting in
a bathtub.
	   Having never won in 12 years on the LPGA tour and playing with a
bad back that forced her to wear a brace and even recline on some
of the tees, Williams' early success was as surprising as Lopez's
lasting frustration.

World Cup: Brazil shows best and worst in thriller with Denmark
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Coach Mario Zagallo usually is radiant
when Brazil wins. This time he looked ill.
	   For much of Friday evening Zagallo had stood red-faced, neck
veins bulging, hollering from the sidelines as his team veered from
inspired to inept against underdog Denmark. Now, his voice weak,
the coach begged off the post-game interviews.
	   ``The tension was too much,'' he said faintly.
	   But he did find a few adjectives for Brazil's thrilling 3-2
victory that moved the defending champions into the World Cup
semifinals and sent the Danes home covered in glory.
	   ``This was a true World Cup game: beautiful, frank and open.''
he said. ``All games should be like this.''
	   If they are, he'll need a cardiologist on the bench. Brazil
showed the best and the worst of its repertoire, alternating
moments of pure art with defensive blunders that would make a
high-school coach wince.
	   Credit the Danes, who played valiant, fearless and cunning
soccer and nearly pulled off the upset of the Cup. And if they
weren't a total surprise after their 4-1 rout of Nigeria, few
thought they would go toe-to-toe with Brazil.
	   But not only did they match up, Denmark struck first.
	   With the game not two minutes old, Brian Laudrup caught the
Brazilians napping on a free kick. While they were still setting
up, he raced in and dropped a pass to Martin Jorgensen for the
tap-in and a 1-0 lead.
	   The Brazilians awoke and treated the 40,000 fans at Beaujoire
stadium to a show.
	   In the 11th minute, Ronaldo hit Bebeto streaking up the middle,
and the 1994 Cup veteran raced in for a low driving shot that tied
it at 1-1.
	   Fifteen minutes later, it was Rivaldo on the receiving end of a
Ronaldo pass. He moved up the left side and chipped a shot over
goalie Peter Schmeichel into the net.
	   With the Ronaldo-Bebeto-Rivaldo trio starting to click, the end
seemed in little doubt. But the Danes had other ideas. Happy just
to be in the quarterfinals for the first time, the team came right
back.
	   And if they needed any help, the Brazilian defense gave it to
them.
	   In the 51st minute, Roberto Carlos tried to clear a loose ball
from his own penalty area with a bicycle kick and missed badly. The
ball wobbled over to Brian Laudrup, who accepted the gift and fired
high and tight into the upper corner to make it 2-2.
	   Rivaldo responded with the game-deciding play. In the 61st
minute, he took a pass from Dunga in the midfield, raced up the
left side and fired across the goal from 25 meters (27 yards) into
the far corner for a 3-2 edge.
	   Still the Danes weren't done. Some nifty passing set up Brian
Laudrup for a shot in the penalty area, but it went just wide.
Minutes later, Marc Rieper hit the crossbar with a header.
	   Referee Gamal Ghandour of Egypt had a busy and irregular night.
He handed out six yellow cards, including one to Cafu that will
sideline him for Brazil's next game with Argentina or the
Netherlands. But he failed even to whistle a vicious tackle on
Ronaldo, and Brazilian fans insulted his mother in Portuguese.
	   The heroic play of Denmark won praise and admiration from the
Brazilians.
	   ``I've never faced a team that played as equals with Brazil.
Denmark did,'' said Bebeto.
	   For goalie Schmeichel, soccer lovers were the real winners.
	   ``I thought we gave the world a great game today, and I'm very
proud of that,'' he said. ``We deserved as much as Brazil to win
this game. We lost, but we lost with honor.''

After months of drought, Mexico battles rains
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ After months of drought and forest fires,
residents of four central and southern Mexican states are battlling
to recover from flooding caused by recent rains.
	   More than 130 families were evacuated Friday from a riverside
community in the Pacific coast resort of Acapulco, after the
Sabanas river overflowed its banks amid heavy rains.
	   Other families sought refuge in local schools after mud slides
threatened their houses in higher areas.
	   In the state of Mexico, about 200 homes were flooded in a
low-lying area near Mexico City. Residents said inadequate drainage
worsened the flooding following heavy rains Thursday.
	   In the neighboring state of Puebla, heavy rains were blamed in
the death of a young man who was caught in a mud slide Thursday on
the flanks of the Popocatepetl volcano.
	   And on Mexico's Caribbean coast, 10 villages in the state of
Quintana Roo were cut off after rains washed out local roads, local
authorities reported.
	   Mexico's rainy season, which usually begins in mid-May, had been
delayed until late late June. The extremely dry conditions helped
spark hundreds of wild fires throughout the country.
	   Authorities in some states said flooding was worsened by the
decrease in forest cover caused by the fires.
