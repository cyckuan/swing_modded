<HEADLINE> Serb Minister Accuses Extradition of Serb Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Minister of
Information Dragan Bozanic today accused the extrandition of two
Serb officers to the Hague for trial as "the biggest scandal"
since the peace accord was signed in December of last year.
</P>
<P>
"The international community and its High Representative to
Bosnia Carl Bildt must restore Bosnian Serbs' confidence to
continue the peace process" following the incident, the Serb news
agency SRNA quoted Bozanic as saying.
</P>
<P>
Two senior Serb officers, Gen. Djordje Djukic and Col. Aleksa
Mrsmanovic were seized on January 30 by Muslim authorities in the
Sarajevo area controlled by IFOR. Under the request of the U.N.
War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the two were taken
out of the Muslim prison Monday night and transported to the Hague
where they are expected to be investigated and tried for war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
"At a time when peace should be consolidated, we are witnessing
an absurd hunting season on people," the Serb minister warned.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim government arrested at least eight Serb officers and
soldiers in the past few weeks on suspicion of war crimes. Four
soldiers were released last week after investigation, and the
other two remained in the Bosnian government prison.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said the arrests would deal a blow to the Bosnia
peace accord which guarantees the freedom of movement of all
civilians in the country. Meanwhile, more and more Serbs in
Sarajevo districts which will be ruled by the Muslim government
next month will move out for fear of retaliation.
</P>
<P>
To protest against the arrests, the Serb authority has
suspended all contacts with the Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
Bozanic said he had discussed the incident with E.U. ambassador
to Sarajevo Robert Frowick who pledged to do his best to prevent a
further aggravation of the situation, the SRNA added.

two years.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Yemen, Eritrea Not to Hold Summit Soon: Yemeni FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdul
Karim al-Iriyani denied here today reports that the Yemeni and
Eritrean presidents will hold talks in Cairo soon to find a
peaceful solution to a dispute between the two countries over
three Red Sea islands.
</P>
<P>
Iriyani, following his meeting with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, told reporters that it is better to give enough time for
the French mediation efforts before the summit takes place.
</P>
<P>
He said that a French envoy is currently in Asmara, capital of
Eritrea, and will leave for Yemeni capital of Sanaa later today.
</P>
<P>
France, Egypt and Ethiopia are making efforts to mediate a
settlement to the Yemeni-Eritrean dispute over the three Red Sea
islands.
</P>
<P>
The dispute flared up last December when the two countries had
a fierce battle. The Eritrean troops occupied the island of
Greater Hanish, while the other two islands are still in the hands
of Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Both Yemen and Eritrea have claimed sovereignty over the
islands.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni foreign minister said that his country has accepted
a French-proposed formula for settling the dispute. France has
suggested that both countries station troops on the disputed
islands.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for the Eritrean stance in this connection," he
said without elaborating on the formula.
</P>
<P>
"What matters now is that the two sides agree on certain
principles that will help defuse the crisis and ensure a peaceful
solution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iriyani said that he briefed Mubarak on the progress achieved
so far through the French mediation.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who attended the meeting
between his Yemeni counterpart and Mubarak, said that Iriyani
conveyed to Mubarak a verbal message from Yemeni President
Ali Abdullah Saleh.
</P>
<P>
The message dealt with the latest developments of the dispute
and the ongoing mediation efforts, Moussa said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Urges Nigeria To Free Political Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 14 (Xinhua)-- The South African
government today expressed its concern over Nigeria's continued
detention of former President General Olusegun Obasanjo and the
presumed winner of an annulled 1993 election M. K. O. Abiola.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Pretoria announcing the return to
Lagos of South Africa's High Commissioner to Nigeria, G. S. Nene,
the Foreign Ministry said the government was appealing for the
release of all political prisoners, including those allegedly
involved in a 1994 attempted coup d'etat.
</P>
<P>
Nene returned to Lagos on Sunday after he was recalled for
briefing by President Nelson Mandela three months ago after
Nigeria's execution of nine minority rights activists.
</P>
<P>
"Without attempting to interfere with the due process of law
in Nigeria, the South African government expresses the hope that
these detainees will be given unhindered access to legal counsel
and their families," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It also expressed its regret over a recent surge in political
uncertainty and instability in several west African nations.
</P>
<P>
"The South African government therefore once again appeals to
all those concerned to join in the international community's
march towards global democracy and the universal respect for all
basic and fundamental human rights," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement added the South African government
welcomed the democratisation process Nigeria had embarked on and
expressed hope the process would continue unabated and without
undue delays.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also reaffirmed that South Africa would remain
supportive of Nigerians' quest for a democratically elected
government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South African government also denied recent
allegations by "certain sources inside Nigeria" about South
African support of Nigerian pro-democracy groups in order to
destabilise that country. enditem

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's Economic Growth in 1995 Exceeds Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 14 (Xinhua)-- The South African economy
grew by over three percent last year despite declines in
agricultural and mining productions, exceeding previous
estimates, said the Central Statistical Service (CSS) in a
statement here today.
</P>
<P>
The CSS said real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by
3.3 percent in 1995, more than half a percent higher than the
forecast of around 2.7 percent at the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures are the highest growth rate recorded since
1988's 4.2 percent and marked the third year of consecutive
positive growth in the South African economy, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 the economy grew by 1.3 percent and in 1994 by 2.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
The non-agricultural sector reported a strong increase in GDP
of 3.8 percent last year, following increases of only 0.6 percent
and two percent during the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing increased by 7.6 percent, while trade improved
by 6.1 percent and transport 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, agriculture and mining declined by 14.9 percent and
3.6 percent respectively.

Overall GDP growth also declined marginally in the fourth
quarter to an annualised 2.7 percent from a previous three
percent.

<HEADLINE> Africa Needs To Rise Up to Challenge, Says Ethiopian Deputy Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Deputy Prime
Minister Kassu Yilala today called on Africans to rise up to the
challenge facing them in order to build strong and competitive
economies.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Deputy Prime Minister made the call at the opening
session of the first session of the Conference of African
Ministers responsible for trade, regional cooperation,
integration and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Yilala said this session took place agaisnt the backdrop of
important changes in the world economy. "A clear understanding of
world trends and a strong resolve to adapt to the emerging world
are the first steps that Africa needs to take for building strong
and competitive economies and so that it can enter the 21st
century as a viable partner to the rest of the world," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to trade in Africa, he said, "Between 1980 and 1993,
the absolute value of Africa's exports stagnated whereas the
volume of international trade doubled. Africa's share in
international trade declined from 5 percent in 1980 to just 2.4
in 1994, resulting in a dramatic decrease in export earnings."
</P>
<P>
Owing to the low level of foreign direct investment flows to
the continent, Africa has become a net exporter of capital, with
net capital outflow amounting to 13.6 billion dollars in 1994, of
which 10 billion dollars went to the annual servicing of our 317
billion dollars debt,he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that under these circumstances, Africans have no
alternative but to adopt new strategies and put in place new
policies to cope with current challenges.
</P>
<P>
Yilala called on African countries to adopt and implement
"vertical and horizontal diversification programs" to change the
situation of overdependence of economies on a limited range of
commodities.
</P>
<P>
On the forthcoming the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development due to be held in
South Africa in April, he said Africans have another opportunity
to voice their concerns and expectations as they move towards an
increasingly globalizing and liberalizing world.

<HEADLINE> New statistics signal hope for cancer control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- New statistics show a down
trend in the cancer death rate, giving Canadians a hope for the
control of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The overall cancer death rates for Canadian men have gradually
declined to an estimated 241 per 100,000 in 1996 from a peak of
253 per 100,000 in 1988, the Statistics Canada said in a report
yesterday. For women, the death rate is 153 per 100,000 this year,
a rate that has changed little in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Cancer experts have attributed the situation for men to less
smoking, better diets, and improved detection and treatment of
some cancers. "Cancer can be controlled, through actions of the
population and the medical community," Statistics Canada senior
analyst Leslie Gaudette said.
</P>
<P>
The difference in death rates between men and women is because
the lung cancer rate has declined in men and risen sharply in
women in recent years. Lung cancer mortality in men has declined
from 81 to 78 per 100,000 from 1988 to 1996, a reflection of the
declining use of tobacco among them since the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
But far more women began smoking after the Second World War,
resulting in a lung cancer death rate that has quadrupled for them
since 1971.
</P>
<P>
The figures show the rising lung cancer rate in women should
make people realize that tobacco is a dangerous, addictive
substance.
</P>
<P>
The previously stable rate for breast cancer showed a small
decrease in 1993. But the mortality rates for prostate cancer are
still rising from 25 per 100,000 in 1969 to 32 per 100,000 in
1996.

Kenya and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Receiving visiting Hungarian Deputy Speaker Maria Korodi in
Nairobi, Ngala hailed the cordial relationship existing between

</P>
<P>
He said tourism is the No. one foreign exchange earner of
Kenya, adding that by March this year over 1,500 Hungarian
tourists will have visited the country.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Dr. Korodi said that Kenya and Hungary have a lot in
common as both are undergoing the process of democratisation
change. She assured the minister that she would help to market
Kenya as a tourism destination when she goes back home.

<HEADLINE> Report: New York Area likely to Face Economic Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The New York metropolitan
region may face threat of a long-term economic decline in the next
century if transportation, reform of education and urban
rejuvenation are not improved, a planning group has warned.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Plan Association, a private research group in
Manhattan, predicted in a report delivered Monday the 24 years of
future for the metropolitan area including New York and part of
Connecticut and New Jersey states.
</P>
<P>
The report said that if current trends remained unchanged,
there would be a bleak landscape of crumbling urban cores,
increasingly isolated wealthy enclaves, transportation paralysis,
deteriorating air and water quality and feeble economic growth.
</P>
<P>
It said that the suburbs for the last 30 years, were the
engines of economic growth and job creation, as corporate office
parks grew in the region's outer ring. But the deep recession of
the late 1980's and early 1990's, and the week recovery since
then, have rendered those old distinctions moot.
</P>
<P>
As measures to save the region's economy, the association
recommended a regional rail express be built to tie together
suburban commuter lines with the New York City subway; short
sections of track in Lang Island City be laid to give Lang Island
Rail Road trains access to Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan and
to Kennedy International Airport; and more tunnels be constructed
to link suburban commuter railroad to the center of New York City.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested the building of new business centers which
will be linked with each other through a more interconnected
transit system, and new arrangement of environment projects.
</P>
<P>
Another suggestion is that strenuous efforts must be made to
help immigrants and minority group members assimilate into the
mainstream economy through education, job training and the
learning of English. But at the same time, it urges recognition
and encouragement of the informal economy that operates in many
ethnic neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
The association's chairman, Gary C. Wendt said, "The issue is
no longer how to manage growth, but how to find growth to manage"
in the region.

<HEADLINE> UK Dispatches Extra Troops to Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Ministry
confirmed today that 500 extra troops would be sent to Northern
Ireland so as to help strengthen security in the conflict-torn
province.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Defense Ministry said that this move was a
prudent measure in the wake of the breakdown of the ceasefire
announced by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) 17 months ago.
</P>
<P>
The extra troops are being sent to ensure the armed forces are
fully able to provide instant support to the police in Ulster if
required, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Since the ceasefire the British government has withdrawn 1,600
soldiers from Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The 500 extra men from the Royal Irish Regiment would bring
back the troop level in Ulster to 17,000 again.
</P>
<P>
But the Defense Ministry spokesman said that it would not mean
a big increase in military patrol activity in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Two other relocated units are also on standby to return to the
troubled province, the spokesman revealed.

but at the opportunities in the eastern Mediterranean that
cooperation and friendship could open up.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen in many other international issues the huge
progress that has been made in the last few years as a result of
dialogue... and therefore we believe that with two responsible
governments in Turkey and Greece it is important that direct
contact be made with each other," he said.
</P>
<P>
Greek and Turkish warships headed last month towards a tiny
islet in the eastern Aegean, with both sides claiming the barren
rocks as their national territory.
</P>
<P>
They pulled out their ships and aircraft after the United
States intervened to head off a military clash between the two
NATO allies.

Baykal is in London on the first leg of his tour of European

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Backs Nigeria's Democratization Program: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
today expressed support for Nigeria's democratization program as
announced by Head of State Sani Abacha on October 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to newsmen here, South African High Commissioner to
Nigeria George Nene said: "The South African government welcomes
the process of democratization upon which the military government
of Nigeria has embarked."
</P>
<P>
In an independence-day speech to the nation on October 1 last
year, Nigerian military ruler Abacha announced a plan to hand
over power to an elected civil government on October 1, 1998, and
the rotation of presidency among the six zones of the country,
among others.
</P>
<P>
Nene returned to Nigeria at the weekend from his recall for
consultation by his government last November in protest against
the hanging of nine Ogoni activists in southern Nigeria, for
which South African President Nelson Mandela later led an
international campaign to punish Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The South African envoy said as his country supported
the ongoing democratization process in Nigeria, it expressed the
hope that "the process will continue unabated and without undue
delays."
</P>
<P>
"The South African government will remain supportive of
Nigeria's quest for a democratically elected government,
representative of all its people," Nene said.

<P>
NICOSIA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A solution to the Cyprus
problem would be to the benefit of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities, Greece, Turkey and the West, said President of the
House of Representatives Alexis Galanos here today.
</P>
<P>
He made remarks at a meeting with three visiting U.S. senators
Claiborne Pell, Charles Robb and James Inhofe.
</P>
<P>
Galanos noted that because of its geographic position, Cyprus
could play an important role against Islamic fundamentalism and
pointed out that solution to the Cyprus problem would improve
Greco-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
"It is important not to consider the Cyprus problem as part of
Greco-Turkish differences," Galanos said and called for a wider
system of guarantees.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides on
Tuesday, the U.S. senators expressed their determination to
assist efforts for a solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure all of you that it is the intention of both the
legislative and executive branch of the U.S. to do everything we
can to assist in bringing this pressing problem to a conclusion
after 21 years," senator Inhofe said after the meeting.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Knesset Approves Early Election Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Knesset (Israel's
parliament) today passed five bills in a preliminary reading on
resolving the parliament and holding early elections.
</P>
<P>
The bills, presented by coalition chairman Ra'anan Cohen, won
the sweeping support of 92 Member of the Knesset (MK) with only
three members voting against it.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres announced on Sunday that
he decided to advance the Knesset general elections, originally
scheduled to be held on October 29, as soon as law allows.
</P>
<P>
However, there has been no consensus date so far for the early
general elections although the supports for the bills were
overwhelming in the Knesset today.
</P>
<P>
Peres said that he received a letter from the Israeli
universities, asking him not to hold the elections on June 4,
because hundreds of thousands of university students are scheduled
 to have examinations on June 8.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the religious parties said that May 28 is
problematic for them because of its proximity to Shavuot, since
the holiday begins this year on May 23, and observant Jews will
not watching television or listening to the radio from then until
May 25.
</P>
<P>
"The last week before the elections is most hectic," said
Degel Hatorah's (a religious party) Avaraham Ravitz. "During this
period the secular parties will be working furiously, but we will
not be able to campaign."
</P>
<P>
According to Jewish traditions, observant Jews are not allowed
to work, or even to reach their electorate during religious
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Peres noted that his Labor party decided to get in touch with
all different parties and see which is the really best date for
all the parties. "We are looking for a consensus, not a single
decision," he added.
</P>
<P>
A Labor official said Peres does not want to deal with the
date and has told his Labor party team to decide instead.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Moshe Shahal, a member of the Labor
team, made it clear that the Labor party would prefer May 28,
saying that there was no reasons to change it to June 4.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cohen told the Knesset that the Labor team would
not decide but instead would let the issue go to the Knesset Law
Committee, which will now discuss the five bills after their
preliminary passage.
</P>
<P>
Today's reading in the Knesset was the first reading for the
bills, and they will come up with the second and the final
readings next week for a final approval for bills.

<HEADLINE> 81 UNITA Fighters Flee Assembly Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A total of 81 UNITA fighters
have fled assembly camps since the quartering process started
last November, the United Nations Angola Verification Mission
(UNAVEM) said today.
</P>
<P>
The UNAVEM said it deplores the phenomenon, whose cause is
unknown as yet. The National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA), which has more than 62,000 troops, has so far
sent 13,285 fighters to the camps in accordance with a peace
agreement signed in Zambia in 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to UNAVEM sources, of these UNITA soldiers, 4,719
have been quartered in Uige Province, 1,705 in Bengo Province,
and 6,861 in the central Huambo Province.
</P>
<P>
UNITA forces began assembling on November 20, 1995, the first
anniversary of the signing of the Lusaka Protocol aimed at ending
nearly two decades of civil war in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The process was halted early last December following armed
clashes near the northern city of Soyo between government forces
and UNITA. It later resumed under the mediation of UNAVEM.
</P>
<P>
The assembly of UNITA troops is crucial to the Angolan peace
process in that it directly affects the creation of a unified
Angolan army, the disarmament of former UNITA guerrillas and the
formation of a government of national unity, among others.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A three-day Southern African
Integration Conference started today in Zimbabwe's northern
resort town of Victoria Falls to seek ways of promoting regional
integration and investment.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 delegates from the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) member states attended the conference.
</P>
<P>
Opening the conference, President of the Confederation of
Zimbabwe Industries Jonah Wakatama stressed, "there is no way you
can pursue narrow nationalist interests and regional integration
at the same time."
</P>
<P>
He said southern Africa's political leaders must translate
their rhetoric back-up on integration into concrete action.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the regional secretariat assume super
national governmental powers to enforce binding regional
programs.
</P>
<P>
He said economic reform programs being implemented in the
region further gave an impetus for integration as the business
community was at the centre of trade.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps we ought to do more for ourselves rather than wait
for the governments to take the lead," he added.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the same conference, German Ambassador to Zimbabwe
Graf Leutrum said by pooling resources together, Southern Africa
could create a competitive economic bloc that could rival other
international groupings.
</P>
<P>
The European Union and German in particular fully backed
current initiatives toward regional integration in the region, he
noted.

<HEADLINE> Elephants Destroy crops in Kenyan District </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Elephants are once again on
the rampage in Nngolia and Mmbololo locations of Taita Taveta
district where they have destroyed hundreds of acres of crops and
are now threatening human life.
</P>
<P>
Residents have threatened to take bows and arrows to fight the
animals if the Kenya Wildlife Services (KWS) does not take
immediate action to contain the jumbos in the national parks, the
Kenya News Agency (KNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chief of golia location Aliud Majani was quoted as saying
people in his area are now forced to harvest green maize for
fear that it will be destroyed by the elephants.
</P>
<P>
Talking to KNA in Voi today, Chief Majani said residents in
his area have sent him to see KWS officials to get a final word on
what they intend to do to keep away the animals and when they
will compensate those whose crops have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The chief said officials from Tsavo east national park have
promise to send helicopters to drive away the jumbos.
</P>
<P>
He urged people to be patient and give the KWS time to take
action before they resort to using bows and arrows.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to contact the district community wildlife officer Mr
John Wanguki for comment were fruitless but an official from his
office said every effort is being made to drive away the animals.
</P>
<P>
The official who refused to be named said a permanent solution
to the problem will be found soon when the work on the electric
fencing of the national park which started four months ago is
completed.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb FM Says Unprincipled Policy Leads  to New Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Foreign Minister
Aleksa Buha has accused some western countries of backing the
unacceptable practice of arresting Serbs and accepting ulterior
fabrication of accusations against Serb officers.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news agency said today Buha addressed open letters
Tuesday to High Representative for Bosnia Carl Bildt, the
five-nation Contact Group -- Germany, Great Britain, France, the
United States and Russia -- and the steering committee of the
conference for the implementation of the Dayton accord, in
reaction to the arrest and extradition of two top-ranking Serb
officers to the Hague tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Serb Gen. Djordje Djukic, Col. Aleksa Krsmanovic were arrested
by Muslim authorities on January 30 in the Sarajevo zone
controlled by the peace Implementation Force IFOR on suspected war
crimes and were transferred Monday to the Hague-based
International War Crimes Tribunal for further investigation.
</P>
<P>
In his letters, Buha said that a satisfactory solution had not
been found to guarantee collective and civil rights of the Serbs
in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Buha also charged the Bosnian government for violating the
peace accord. "The deadline under the peace accord for the release
of all war prisoners in Bosnia expired a long time ago, but
hundreds of Serbs were still detained in prisons of the
Muslim-Croat federation and Croatia," Buha said.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for the release of all prisoners of war was
January 19 under the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has said 88
Serbs are held in prisons in the Bosnian city of Tuzla.
</P>
<P>
Buha also said the U.N. sanctions against the Serbs had not
been lifted although they had met all obligations set by U.N.
Security Council resolution 222.
</P>
<P>
These examples confirmed that unprincipled policy could trigger
a new tragedy, and international community must do its utmost to
avert it, Buha said.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb authority has suspended all contacts with
Muslim-Croat federation for arresting Serb officers and soldiers
on suspected war crimes.

Discussions with Mozambican Agriculture Minister Carlos
Agostinho do Rosario centred around a protocol on cooperation
between the two countries' agriculture ministries.
</P>
<P>
Technical, scientific and human resource development,
including facilitation to establish South African farmers in
Mozambique, was also discussed.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two ministers had agreed that the land
in question would remain the property of the Mozambican
government.
</P>
<P>
However, Rosario said control of the land would be vested not
in individual farmers but in a joint company split equally
between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
The company would then process applications from South African
farmers wanting to participate.
</P>
<P>
The next step was to set up the joint company, said Rosario.
</P>
<P>
Many South African white farmers have expressed interest in
starting farm in Mozambique, saying they are tired of South
Africa's endemic droughts.
</P>
<P>
Sokutu said both parties expressed hope that an agreement
would soon be signed by the two governments.

<P>
TOKYO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan and South Korea collided
head-on today over a group of islet claimed ownership by both
sides, Kyodo News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
Both Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda and South Korean
Ambassador to Japan Kim Tae Zhee insisted on their countries'
claim to a disputed islet called Takeshima in Japanese and the
Tokto islet in Korean during their meeting.
</P>
<P>
Kim said the rocky islet in the Sea of Japan are an integral
part of South Korea, Kyodo quoted a Japanese Foreign Ministry
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
While saying Seoul is aware of Tokyo's claim to the islet, the
ambassador maintained that South Korea has no intention to discuss
the question of its ownership with Japan.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda reiterated Japan's claim to the islet but added the
dispute over the islet, now controlled by South Korea, should not
poison bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The two men agreed to seek a resolution through dialogue to the
problems arising from the two countries' future construction of a
300-kilometer-long exclusive economic zone around the islet,
which ignited the long-simmering quarrel recently.
</P>
<P>
Japan cancelled the coalition's ruling party's visit to South
Korea scheduled for February 11 after South Korean President Kim
Young-sam cancelled a meeting with Japanese Lawmakers on
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Jet Fighter Design for Next Century Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- British Aerospace and McDonnell
Douglas of the United States unveiled on Tuesday their design for
a highly advanced fighter plane, which could be put into service
next century, the Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under a joint UK-US joint program, the two companies have
produced a radical design which will not have tail fin and the
aircraft stability will be controlled by directing the engine's
exhaust.
</P>
<P>
Removing the tail fin cuts the fighter's radar reflection and
makes it harder for enemies to spot and the new aircraft will be
specially shaped and made of non-reflection materials to reduce
its radar image further.
</P>
<P>
The design is one of the entries for the U.S. Joint Advanced
Strike Technology (JAST) program, which is finding a single
aircraft to replace a number of different planes: the F-16 light
fighter for the US Air Force, the F-14 and F-18 for the U.S. Navy
and the AV-8B Harrier jump jets for the Marines.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Britain's Ministry of Defense has invested 200
million U.S. dollars in the 2 billion-dollar JAST program.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the British side is to develop a plane in three
versions.
</P>
<P>
One will have short take-off, vertical-landing capability to
replace the Royal Navy's Sea Harrier fighter-bombers.
</P>
<P>
A second version will replace carrier-borne fighter planes; A
third version, built on the same production line, will operate
from conventional runaways.

<P>
JAKARTA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to stop further construction of resort houses in Puncak
mountainous area, 60 kilometers south of Jakarta in order to
prevent floods in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced here today by President Soeharto
when he gave his swift response to the severe floods that hit
Jakarta last Friday.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the construction of more tourism facilities in
Puncak is no longer allowed.
</P>
<P>
The poor planned construction of tourism facilities in Puncak
mountains has been considered as one cause of the floods which had
paralyzed the capital for several days. The construction caused
soil erosion by cutting trees.
</P>
<P>
To make Puncak a conservation area, the government will develop
the area into a forest for eco-tourism.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to free Jakarta from floods, President Soeharto
had instructed to widen and deepen the rivers running through
Jakarta to let river water flow smoothly into the sea.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta municipal government will demolish houses in slum
areas along the river banks and clear away garbage from the
rivers.

<HEADLINE> Maccanico Fails to Form Italian Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Premier-designate Antonio
Maccanico gave up efforts to form a new government Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters after a meeting with President Oscar Scalfaro
that he was "deeply embittered" by the failure.
</P>
<P>
After three rounds of consultations with major political
leaders, Scalfaro authorized Maccanico on February 1 to form a new
government following the resignation of Lamberto Dini's technocrat
government on January 11.
</P>
<P>
Maccanico was forced to give up after two weeks of intense
negotiations with the rival center-right and center-left political
blocs led to nowhere.
</P>
<P>
The political future for Italy remains hazy following the
latest development.
</P>
<P>
When asked what he could do to help overcome the crisis, he
said that the question should have been raised before Scalfaro,
who has yet to decide whether to designate someone else to try
again to form a government or dissolve the parliament and call
snap elections.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro, in order to avoid snap elections, might choose
someone else to form a government, but chances of early elections
could not be ruled out since it would be hard for him to find a
figure acceptable to all parties. Besides, there are strong
pressure for early elections coming from some parties, like the
Democratic Party of the Left.
</P>
<P>
Maccanico's failure is seen to be understandable because the
new government would have been a cross-party body without support
from a parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the major political parties could hardly
agree on sensitive issues like the political reforms that the new
government would have to carry out.

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- L.K. Advani, president of
India's major opposition Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), today filed
an application before a designated court here, saying that the
charge sheet against him in the multi-crore rupee hawala case was
baseless.
</P>
<P>
The BJP president said in the application that on the basis of
the material submitted before the special court by the Central
Bureau of Investigation (CBI), "no case is made out" against him.
</P>
<P>
Seeking a speedy trial of the hawala case because of which he
resigned from his house of the people seat, Advani said the court
should not take cognizance of the charge sheet and alleged that it
was filed to "keep a cloud of suspicion" around him.
</P>
<P>
The BJP leader pointed out that the charge sheet was aimed at
tarnishing his image and that of his party on the eve of the
general elections as BJP was a front runner to form a new central
government.
</P>
<P>
Advani, together with some other top politicians, was accused
by the CBI of accepting bribes from illegal foreign exchange
dealers.

<HEADLINE> Arrangements Ready for Polls in Bangladesh: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, February 14 (Xinhua) -- All arrangements have been
completed for free and fair elections tomorrow, Bangladesh's Chief
Election Commissioner A.K.M. Sadeq convinced the nation today,
seeking cooperation of all to make the polls a success.
</P>
<P>
It was announced that the polling begins at 08:00 a.m. and ends
at 04:00 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the countrymen over radio and television on the eve
of the elections, the chief commissioner said that the elections
have assumed greater significance even though being held in a
different perspective because it is essentially a necessity for
maintaining the constitutional and democratic process and exhorted
the people to exercise their right of franchise to help maintain
the process.
</P>
<P>
Describing the responsibility of casting votes in a democratic
polity as a national obligation, Sadeq urged the voters to
exercise their right of franchise judiciously since voting is a
sacred duty for every citizen -- regardless of shades of opinion.
</P>
<P>
While the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its
government have got ready for the polls, all opposition parties
have boycotted the polls process and vowed to resist the polling
at any cost. They began their 48-hour nationwide strike this
morning.

COLOMBO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government
today declared indefinite closure of all schools in the country
following the Tamil rebel threat of making 10,000 Sinhala mothers
weep, the Education Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
Schools in and around Colombo have been heavily guarded during
the past few months and roads surrounding the schools have
remained closed.
</P>
<P>
After a bomb blast at Newstead Girls School today in Negombo,
23 miles north of Colombo though causing no damage, the government
decided to take the action specially following concern of parents
islandwide.
</P>
<P>
Last year, all schools in the country were closed indefinitely
and public examinations were also postponed nationwide after the
attack on Colombo's oil installations on October 22.
</P>
<P>
All the schools were reopened on January 1 this year and
examinations were subsequently held.
</P>
<P>
But following the January 31 bomb blast which destroyed the
country's Central Bank in Colombo and subsequent discovery of
lorry loads of explosives, schools in the capital of Colombo were
heavily guarded.

SHANGHAI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Yisi, the first person
in the world to have had all her small intestine entirely removed,
is still alive ten years after the operation.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago on this day, Zhou, who was in her seventh month

Then, in 1988, she had a gallstone operation that proved to be
successful, and was even able to get pregnant again three years
later, five years after the original operation. There was still a

<HEADLINE> EC Calls for Reformed European Trade Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
is proposing to make EU (European Union) trade policies more
effective in evaluating open foreign markets which European
companies consider vital to their exports.
</P>
<P>
EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan made the remarks at a press
conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said the EC would set up a comprehensive database to
compile information acquired from governments and industries of
the EU member nations under a so-called Market Access Strategy.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the EC would regularly identify main
trade barriers and priority markets, adding that EU trade
promotion programs would be used to raise the profile of European
companies and to support market-opening actions.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the proposal, the commissioner said, "While
remaining vigilant to unfair trade that damages European industry,
it is time for Europe to abandon its defensiveness about
liberalization and focus fully on opening those markets that
remain closed to our products and investment."
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the strategy "would not create any
new policy obstacles or jeopardize the EU's WTO (World Trade
Organization) obligations."
</P>
<P>
The EC will set up a special group to handle business inquiries
and coordinate among EC departments in charge of different trade
policy issues.
</P>
<P>
The EU, heavily dependent on trade and investment, accounts for
one-fifth of trade in goods and one-third of foreign direct
investment worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Aideed Arrests Ten Electricians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Most parts of south
Mogadishu were plunged into darkness last night after ten
electricians of a private electric company were arrested by
militiamen of a Somali faction leader earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Elman Ali Ahmed, the owner of the electricity company, told
newsmen here today his employees were caught and jailed by
militiamen loyal to Mohamed Farah Aideed, when fixing an
interrupted circuit on a lamp post near the Libyan Embassy which
is close to Aideed's headquarters in south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed said he was ordered to get a working permit from
Aideed's Ministry of Energy and Power. He complained about the
conduct of Aideed's militiamen, who did not allow him to feed his
employees Tuesday evening following a day's fasting for the holy
month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to Aideed's government, the
electricians were being interrogated and their case would go
under investigation.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed, who turned off four of his big generators which light
more than two districts in Mogadishu, in protest against the
detention, appealed to Aideed's government to release
unconditionally his employees as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed has created business for many militiamen after training
some of them to work on electricity, others to be drivers and
mechanics. Aideed considers the militia rehabilitation activities
to be a major setback to his militia strength.
</P>
<P>
Aideed's government has earlier issued a warranty of
imprisonment for Ahmed for those activities without its
knowledge. The warranty did not work following the resistance of
many prominent leaders within the self-declared government.
</P>
<P>
Aideed's government, one of the three in the Horn of Africa
nation, has not got international recognition except by Libya.

LONDON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind said on Tuesday that the British government should
not take a hard line in a forthcoming white paper on the future of
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The British government announced in January that it would
publish a white paper setting out its stance on the future of
Europe ahead of the Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) to be held

</P>
<P>
The IGC conference, to be held in Turin, Italy, is aimed at

Rifkind told the European Legislation Select Committee that
Britain should not demand immediate clarification on major issues
so as to avoid confrontation with its EU partners.

<P>
Euro-sceptics of the ruling Conservative Party had urged the
government to veto any extension of qualified majority voting,
retain Britain's immigration regulations and revise EU common
agriculture policy.
</P>
<P>
They also demanded an overhaul of the single European currency
and a halt to any moves towards a common defense and foreign
policy in the EU.

</P>
<P>
Members discussed suggestions on selecting the first chief

<P>
For the selection process they pointed to the decision of the

shall recommend the candidate for the first chief executive
through local consultations or through nomination and election
after consultations, and report the candidate to the Central

<HEADLINE> Iran to Toughen Punishment for US, Israeli Spies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran is to toughen
punishments, including execution, for those who spy for the
United States and Israel by amending a law, a local daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Kayhan said the parliament approved in its
open session to discuss the amendment in order to suppress the
espionage activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a bill passed last October, those charged with
spying for any country will get up to 10-years imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Ali Movahedi Savoji, one of the sponsors of
the bill and a right-wing hardliner member of the parliament, as
saying that 10 years jail would not be sufficient for American
and Israeli spies.
</P>
<P>
"We are suggesting that those who spy for the U.S. and Israel
would get the punishment specified for enemies," he added.
</P>
<P>
The punishment specified for the enemies would include death
by hanging or firing squad.
</P>
<P>
On January 6, the Supreme Court sentenced three Iranians to
death on charges of spying for the United States.
</P>
<P>
Kayhan reported in early January that the sentences were to be
carried out soon.
</P>
<P>
However, it gave no detail on when they were arrested. So far,
the Iranian press have not revealed whether the sentences have
been carried out.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the sentences have been the severest
punishment for those accused of espionage in the country in the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
Three of the five men sentenced to death for spying for the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) are Kazem Afkhami Moqaddam
Tabrizi, Jalil Showqi Khatibi and Mohammad Mehdi Abbas-Zadeh
Darban.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily the three were charged with having
direct contact with, and recruiting for, the CIA. Their cases
have been under investigation since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The supreme court also ruled that before their execution all
three have to return the money that they received directly from
the CIA to the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
Moqaddam Tabrizi is to return 11,360 dollars, Showqi Khatibi
11,000 dollars and Abbas-Zadeh Darban 7,000 dollars plus 1,000
German marks.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the amendment to the espionage law
serves as a signal that Tehran is taking tough measures to
suppress any dangerous elements inside the country in a bid to
thwart any spying activities backed by Washington.

<HEADLINE> Indian Congress Leaders Back Rao on Hawala Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A high-level meeting of
India's ruling Congress Party Tuesday backed Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao in his efforts to cleanse public life and urged him
to nominate officials with a clean image in the coming general
elections.
</P>
<P>
According to the Times of India today, the day-long meeting of
state leaders of the Congress passed a resolution welcoming the
decision of the prime minister to give a free hand to the
investigative agencies in discharging their duty of bringing out
the truth in the Hawala scandal.
</P>
<P>
The Hawala scandal refers to a bribery case in which some top
Indian politicians were accused of receiving kickbacks from
illegal foreign exchange traders.
</P>
<P>
According to Congress spokesman V.N. Gadgil, Rao in his opening
remarks said the Congress was on the upswing and its workers were
enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
Though the prime minister did not refer to the corruption issue
in his speech which primarily dealt with election strategy, the
resolution stated that the legal process is being allowed to take
its own course, no matter who is involved therein.
</P>
<P>
The resolution emphasized that this attitude alone will help
cleanse the society in general and political process in
particular.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, first of its kind after the filing of charge
sheets against three cabinet ministers and senior leaders of other
parties in the Hawala case, was held in the backdrop of a demand
raised by some party leaders for convening of the Congress Working
Committee to discuss the fallout of the scandal.

SHANGHAI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The trade volume through
Shanghai port totalled 2.879 billion U.S. dollars in January, 41
percent higher than the same period last year, according to
statistics released by the Shanghai Customhouse.
</P>
<P>
Of the figure, imports were up by 95.7 percent to reach 1.777
billion U.S. dollars, while exports were down by 1.8 percent to
1.103 billion U.S. dolars.
</P>
<P>
A customs official attributed the increase in imports mainly to
higher amounts of equipment purchased by foreign-funded
enterprises and the growth of the processing trade.
</P>
<P>
Though the total export value decreased, its processing trade
registered a robust growth, turning out an export value of 495
million U.S. dollars, 22.9 percent up on the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Export by foreign-funded enterprises surged 42.6 percent but
those of state-run foreign trade organs dropped by 17.1 percent
compared with the same month of last year.

JERUSALEM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Finance Minister
Avraham Shohat has appealed to the Knesset (Parliament) Fiance
Committee to approve the issuing of state guarantees of up to 410
million dollars to finance a landmark deal in which Israel
Aircraft Industries (IAI) would upgrade Turkish warplanes.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has chosen IAI to upgrade its fleet of fighter-jets,
including F-5s, but according to industry sources, said that it
cannot pay for the work at least the next two years, reported The
Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
Treasury officials said the guarantees for the deal require
special approval, as the package exceeds the standard ceiling of
200 million U.S. dollars. They added that the deal -- worth about
600 million dollars -- is one of high-risk that requires Knesset
approval.
</P>
<P>
Shohat asked the committee to approve the issuing of loans by
Israeli banks to the Turkish government and that the state
participates in guaranteeing the money.
</P>
<P>
IAI has already signed a contract for the upgrade. But
officials said the deal is dependent on guaranteed loans approved
by the government.
</P>
<P>
The deal has generated controversy among defense industry
executives and analysts. They agree that such a deal would
catapult IAI and local industry into a level of activity. But
analysts doubt if Turkey can meet its part of the deal.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The rapid economic growth
of China is not only conducive to the improvement of living
standards of the Chinese people, but also "good news" for mankind
as a whole, said Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker
today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Chinese reporters on eve of his four-day
official visit to China beginning February 26, the prime minister
dismissed the view that a strong China poses a threat to the rest
of the world.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that China's development, instead of being a
threat, will provide opportunities for the rest of the world since
China has neither been warlike in history nor cherishes hegemonic
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
The world needs a developed China and its economic boom, he
said. Otherwise it would lose balance and peace and stability
would be at stake.
</P>
<P>
China has scored notable achievements in various fields thanks
to its economic reforms and opening policy, Juncker noted, adding
that his country has been following these great undertakings with
admiration.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming visit will offer him a chance to witness in person
the achievements and to learn from China's experience in economic
development, the 41-year-old prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Political and economic relations between the two countries have
been enhanced in the past two years. Two-way trade hit 62.5
million U.S. dollars in 1995, up 80 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Juncker said there are still rooms for further expansion in
this field. He expressed hopes that the two sides could expand
their cooperation to the fields of finance and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
After his stay in China, the prime minister is expected to fly
to Bangkok, Thailand, for the Asia-Europe Summit scheduled for
March 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that Asia and Europe should have more direct
dialogues and hoped that the meeting may help establish a
mechanism for regular contacts between the two continents.

development of bilateral cooperation in the economy, trade,
science, and technology, and said that his mission here is to

in strengthening ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the issue of Macao, Jiang said that China and
Portugal have earnestly implemented the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration on Macao, and the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group
has had regular consultations on the smooth transition and
transfer of power in Macao and has made progress in solving a
series of problems.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that Macao's stability and development are in the
interests of both China and Portugal, and that as long as the two
sides hold consultations and cooperation, problems in the
transitional period will be settled properly.
</P>
<P>
Gama said that Portugal and China have made progress in
resolving many problems during the transitional period. The
Portuguese side hopes that greater progress will be made in this
regard this year, he told Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also asked Gama to convey his greetings to Portugal's new
President-elect Jorge Sampaio and new Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres, and added that he welcomes them to visit China at their
earliest convenience. Jiang also asked Gama to convey his
greetings to Portuguese President Soares.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Spokesman on Petroleum Price Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government was
not responsible for the increase in petroleum prices, a government
spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that some press reports which attributed the
price hike to the government did not convey the factual position.
</P>
<P>
He said that the domestic petroleum prices had been linked with
the international prices under an agreement with the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
An announcement to this effect was made in a press-note on
December 31, 1995, he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that the domestic oil prices fluctuate
with the international prices, and the government does not
determine if the prices should go up or down.

DHAKA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The army personnel will be
deployed in each polling station in Bangladesh to maintain peace
and security for tomorrow's parliamentary polls, a high-ranking
election official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"I have instructed the army only to demonstrate and not to
exercise their force," Chief Election Commissioner A.K.M. Sadek
told a press conference held at the Election Commission
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the armed forces would only act when they would
be asked by the respective local administration and their
activities would be guided by a magistrate.

In each of over 21,000 polling stations in the country, a
13-member law enforcing team would be deployed to help the civil
administration supervise election smoothly, Sadek said.

The chief election commissioner also condemned the anti-poll
quarters who are openly threatening the candidates and voters by
setting fire, damaging properties and exploding bombs.
</P>
<P>
"We have information that the anti-election groups have much
sophisticated weapons. This situation has necessitated the
calling of army to such large numbers." he said.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces would withdraw by February 17, immediately
after the polls, he added.

</P>
<P>
Director of Defense Information Brigadier-General Fred Chijuka

</P>
<P>
"The unfortunate clashes at the Bakassi Peninsula will soon

<HEADLINE> "Chinese Agriculture May Have Started 10,000 Years Ago" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists are of
the opinion that the country's agriculture might have emerged
10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The clue to the earliest existence of agricultural civilization
in China was obtained by a Sino-US archeological team at the end
of last year, when it excavated a prehistoric cave in east China's
Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
This date is 3,000 or 4,000 years earlier than the previous
date for the beginning of China's agricultural activities.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists found in the Xianren (celestial being) Cave a
deposit that shows clearly that at that time China was in
transition from the Paleolithic Age to the Neolithic Age.
</P>
<P>
Traces of rice-like plants were found in the upper part of the
deposits in the cave, according to Yan Wenming from the Archeology
Department of Beijing University
</P>
<P>
The cave was first excavated in the 1960s. However, a further
excavation conducted by archeologists from Beijing University, the
Jiangxi Institute of Archeology and the Andover Foundation for
Archeological Research of the US obtained new findings last year.
</P>
<P>
The joint team found in the cave stratified deposits whose
upper and lower parts, separated by pieces of rocks which had
fallen from the roof of the cave, contributed different relics.
</P>
<P>
The upper part contained polished stone ware, fragments of
other kinds of pottery and a lot of shells, while the lower part
has only chipped stoneware, very few shells and no pottery.
</P>
<P>
Radiocarbon dating showed that the upper part dates back
9,000-14,000 years (in the early Neolithic Age) and the lower part
is from the middle to the late Paleolithic Age, some 15,000-20,000
years ago. The traces of rice-like plants were found in the upper
part.
</P>
<P>
But the archeologists said they still cannot confirm that
agricultural tools are among the unearthed stone wares.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the transition from the Paleolithic Age to
the Neolithic Age signaled a transition from relying on nature to
remolding nature by developing production.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archeologists consider that the Xianren Cave has
yielded some of the most important relics the founding of the
People's Republic of China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
A total of 625 stone wares, 318 bone wares, 26 pierced shell
wares, 516 pieces of pottery, 20 pieces of human bone and more
than 10,000 pieces of animal bone were found at the site.
</P>
<P>
Some fragments of pottery decorated with rough, irregular lines
found in the cave are said to be among the earliest examples of
pottery ever found in China.

FUZHOU, February 14 (Xinhua) -- During the past five years
southeast China's Fujian Province has ratified the setting up of a
total of 14,800 foreign-funded enterprises, 4.8 times the figure
during the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises involve 35.2 billion US dollars in contracts,
more than 13 times the figure during the 1986-1990 period.
</P>
<P>
Last year provincial foreign-funded enterprises generated
almost 73 billion yuan in industrial output value and 4.8
billion US dollars in foreign exchange, accounting for 44.9
percent and 51.5 percent of local total, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Of the enterprises set up during the past five years, 10 are
share-holding companies, and 29 are group enterprises; the number
of exclusively foreign-owned enterprises exceeds that of
Sino-foreign joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Such enterprises are becoming more involved in capital- and
technology-intensive projects, and transfer labor-intensive items
to provincial mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises run businesses in the fields of agriculture,
industry, construction, tourism, real estate, public facilities
and services. Among them, the industrial sector enjoys the largest
investment, accounting for six percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Attracting overseas funds from 58 countries and regions during
the 1991-1995 period, the enterprises injected 59.47 percent of
contractual investment into industrial projects and 39.53 percent
into service items.

Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The bureau conducted a census on one percent of the national

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Not To Lecture To Others, Says Nzo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government would not lecture Libyan leader Maammar Gaddafi and
Cuban President Fidel Castro on "how to manage their own
affairs", South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said
yesterday in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
A local daily "The Citizen" today quoted Mr. Nzo as saying
that South Africa was committed to a policy of "promoting
democracy" in its foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said President Nelson Mandela had made it clear, when he
spoke about Gaddafi and Castro, that South Africa would get the
opportunity of saying "thanking you very much for the assistance
provided during the liberation movement" when the two leaders
came here for the visits.
</P>
<P>
"That is what the president has made perfectly clear on that
question. We are not calling them here to lecture to them on how
they must manage their own affairs," added Nzo.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the intended visits would not create problems for
South Africa in its diplomatic relations with other countries, Nzo
said hopefully not, if these problems would arise, they would be
dealt with at the time.
</P>
<P>
Nzo also stressed that South Africa invited those countries
because they supported the anti-apartheid struggle and social
liberation.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's intention to invite Gaddafi has caused a political stir
among the main political parties in the country. The opposition
parties claimed that the invitations were not in South Africa's
national interest.

<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, told visiting
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama at a meeting in Beijing
that China attaches great importance to the Macao issue, which is
"left over by history".
</P>
<P>
The proper settlement of the Macao issue is of importance to
maintaining the prosperity and stability of Macao and to
developing friendly relations between China and Portugal, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Government is satisfied with the good cooperation
between China and Portugal on the Macao issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
China also hopes that the two sides "will make joint efforts to
ensure the stable transition of Macao and the smooth transfer of
power by properly handling various issues during Macao's
transitional period according to the Sino-Portugal joint
declaration."
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC chairman noted that Sino-Portugal relations have been
growing well since the two countries established diplomatic links.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he added, the exchange of high-level visits
have been increasing, which marks, and has helped promote, the
development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government is ready to push the existing
ties further forward.

<P>
Briefing the visitor on the work of the CPPCC National
Committee, Li said "we are willing to increase exchanges with the
Portuguese parliament to help promote the development of
Sino-Portuguese relations."
</P>
<P>
Gama said Portugal attaches importance to developing friendly
relations with China and is working hard to enhance cooperation
with China on the Macao issue in order to ensure the smooth
transition of Macao.
</P>
<P>
This policy has won unanimous support from various political
parties in the Portuguese parliament, he said.
</P>

importance to, and supports, the development of relations between
the European Union and China.

<P>
According to the sources, the ship is caught in a raging fire
with frequent explosions creating a massive fireworks display at

<HEADLINE> Census: China's Population Growth Slowing Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- China's population growth has
slowed down to an annual rate of 1.21 percent during the past five
years, 0.34 percentage points less than in the previous five
years, according to a report made public today by the State
Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The bureau conducted a census on one percent of the national
population on October 1 last year. Based on the results from this
sample survey, the bureau estimates that China had 1.20778 billion
people then, a rise of 6.54 percent over the 1.13368 people
calculated by the fourth national census conducted on July 1, 1990.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China's population saw a net increase of 12.71 million
people over 1994, or a yearly increase of 1.055 percent over 1994,
according to estimates.
</P>
<P>
Last year China's population growth saw a decrease of 650,000
people from 1994.
</P>
<P>
The census found that China's households have been becoming
smaller over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
On October 1 last year, China had 322.11 million households,
which comprised 1.19181 billion people, and the average household
had 3.7 people.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, 1990, however, the average household had four people.
</P>
<P>
China's male population has outstripped the female
population. On October 1, 1995, China had 616.29 million men,
accounting for 51.03 percent of the total population, and 591.49
million women, accounting for 48.97 percent of the total
population.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of men to women was 104.19 to 100, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The census found that the population of minority nationalities
grew quicker than that of the Han, the majority Chinese people,
over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The total population of the 55 minority nationalities was
108.46 million on October 1 last year, with its ratio in the
national population rising from 8.04 percent in 1990 to 8.98
percent.
</P>
<P>
A total of 347.52 million people now live in towns and
cities. The urban population ratio of the total rose 2.62
percentage points from July 1, 1990 to October 1 last year.
</P>
<P>
The census found that more people have received normal school
education and that the rate of illiteracy and semi-illiteracy has
dropped from 15.88 percent of the total national population to
12.01 percent in the past five years. Some 145.05 million people
aged 15 or above are illiterate.

ANKARA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Deniz
Baykal flew from Istanbul this morning for European Union (EU)
countries to start a diplomatic initiative to persuade them to
remain neutral on the Aegean dispute between Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Baykal is expected to visit Britain, Belgium and France and

"We think that it is necessary to develop a friendly
understanding in the relations between Turkey and Greece. We
believe that it is necessary to open a term of a new peace in the
Aegean," the Turkish Foreign Minister said before his departure
for the western countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both NATO members, staged a military
confrontation in the Aegean sea last month over the disputed Imia

HANOI, February 14 (Xinhua)-- A total of 73 school children
were admitted to hospital in Ho Chi Minh City recently as a result
of a mass food poisoning attack, said an official report reaching
here today.
</P>
<P>
The children admitted for treatment had symptoms of acute

<HEADLINE> South Korea, U.S. Not to Hold Joint Maneuver in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the United
States have decided not to conduct their joint military exercise
"Team Spirit" this year, the Defense Ministry announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made to foster a "more positive atmosphere
for security" on the Korean Peninsula and to build confidence
needed for the consistent fulfillment of the nuclear framework
agreement signed between the U.S. and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) in Geneva in 1994, a ministry spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The "Team Spirit" exercise had been held annually in South
Korea from 1976, but was cancelled in 1992, 1994 and 1995 when the
DPRK signed a nuclear safeguards accord with the International
Atomic Energy Agency and the Geneva agreement with the U.S.
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang strongly opposes the "Team Spirit" exercise, describing
it as a "rehearsal for invading the DPRK."
</P>
<P>
Under the Pyongyang-Washington Geneva framework agreement, the
DPRK agreed to freeze its nuclear program in exchange for light-
water nuclear reactors to replace its graphite reactors.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, however, said South Korea and the U.S. may
discuss resuming the maneuver next year if the DPRK "does not
implement the Geneva agreement or poses a serious military threat."
</P>
<P>
At present, some 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South
Korea.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official: Palestinian State to be Set Up in Three Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
said that the establishment of a Palestinian state will come true
in "at most three years."
</P>
<P>
Mahamoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), member of the Executive Committee
of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), made the
prediction in an interview with Beirut-based Arabic weekly Assayad
issued today.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian state is undoubtedly coming," the PLO official
stressed in the interview.
</P>
<P>
"And this is a truth," he said, "so I am not selling dreams or
illusions, but sure that a result of the peace negotiations in the
last phase will come with the Palestinian state in at most three
years."
</P>
<P>
The state is no longer in the Israeli diplomatic forbidden
areas and most members in (Israeli Prime Minister) Shimon Peres'
government are confident that the last phase of the negotiations
will not finish unless the Palestinian state is established with
Al-Qudds (Jerusalem) as its capital, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We know that the negotiations will be difficult," Abu Mazen
added, "but we are ready for the negotiations which deal with the
most crucial problems like Al-Qudds, the borders, the refugees and
the (Jewish) settlements."
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinians will emphasize to the Israelis the
need to implement the U.N. Security Council resolutions 242 and
338 which call for a complete Israeli withdrawal from the (Arab)
lands occupied in 1967.
</P>
<P>
"That means the (Israeli) withdrawal from Al-Qudds and a
redemarcation of the international borders, and a payment of
compensation for those who do not want a return," Abu Mazen
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We are not much concerned with the statement of some Israelis
about an impossibility for the withdrawal to the 1967 borders
since the American administration is committed to the peace
settlement in the light of the resolutions 242 and 338, and Shimon
Peres has pointed to Israel's commitment to these two resolutions
because he is determined to advance the peace process until the
comprehensive peace is realized."
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians on the
Jerusalem issue will begin in May, when the two sides begin talks
on the final status of Palestinian autonomy.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Police Arrest 2 Islamic Activists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian police have
arrested in the West Bank two Islamic Jihad activists who had
planned a suicide attack inside Israel, Israel Radio reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The radio, citing a senior Palestinian police source, said that
the arrests were made Tuesday night after Palestinian police and
Palestinian Preventive Security Service agents had searched places
where they suspected Hamas or Islamic Jihad activists planning to
launch a suicide attack against Israeli targets might be hiding.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a closure imposed by the Israeli Army on the
West Bank and Gaza Strip continues, and only the West
Bank town of Turkarim is open to Israeli traffic.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army has sealed off the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip since Monday night to prevent any possible attacks an
educational institution or public transportation services in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army and security establishments have been on
high alert and security officials called on the Israeli public
to be especially wary and to inform the authorities of
anything suspicious.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres said Tuesday that the
decision to impose the closure was based on reports of
attempts to infiltrate into Israel to launch attacks, especially
to mark the end of the 40-day morning period for death of
Hamas activist Yihye Ayyash.
</P>
<P>
Ayyash, nick-named "The Engineer" because of his bomb-making
skill, was assassinated in the Gaza Strip on January 5. Hamas had
said that Israeli General Security Services (GSS) were behind
the assassination.
</P>
<P>
The GSS had accused Ayyash of masterminding a series of
suicide bombing attacks, which resulted in killing at least 70
Israelis and wounding more than 300 others, and the services had
been hunting for him before he was finally murdered.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Policy proposals to
regulate employment standards in South Africa have been made in
the government's newly publicized green paper, said a source
obtained here today.
</P>
<P>
The green paper, released by Labour Minister Tito Mboweni in
Cape Town yesterday, started from the need to balance the
protection of minimum standards and labour market flexibility.
</P>
<P>
The proposals were aimed at developing new laws to regulate
employment standards in the country and to replace the basic
conditions of employment act and the wage act.
</P>
<P>
The document suggested that working hours be reduced to 40
hours a week in line with international standards.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, a time-table would have to be worked out to
cater to a national strategy to promote job creation,
productivity, human resource development and wage compensation,
the document indicated.
</P>
<P>
The proposals contained in the green paper, if adopted by
Parliament, might be implemented as soon as next January, the
source said, adding the green paper was welcomed by business and
labour leaders in the country.

<HEADLINE> Negotiator: Breakthrough Unlikely In Syrian-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A breakthrough in the
Syrian-Israeli peace talks is unlikely before the Israeli general
elections that have been advanced for half a year, according to a
senior Israeli official.
</P>
<P>
Uri Savir, Director-General of the Israeli Foreign Ministry,
said here Tuesday night that there are still serious differences
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported today that Savir, who heads the Israeli
delegation to the talks, will travel to the U.S. to hold another
round of talks with the Syrian side in Maryland later this month.
</P>
<P>
The date, which was originally set for February 26, has been
postponed until 28. Progress was made in previous rounds of
talks, but no significant breakthrough achieved.
</P>
<P>
In announcing his decision to move up elections Sunday,
Prime Minister Shimon Peres admitted that negotiations with
Syria on "security arrangements and water issues are taking
longer than expected."
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that he decided to advance the elections
"after U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's successful
visit to Damascus showed that peace can be pursued while an
election campaign is under way."
</P>
<P>
Savir, who ended a two-day visit to Jordan Tuesday, said

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan-China Relations Vigorous: FM Tokayev </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- There is a good momentum in
the development of Kazakhstan-China relations, which are brimming
with vigor, visiting Kazakhstan Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart
Tokayev said here today.
</P>
<P>
Tokayev made the remarks in a meeting with a group of scholars
from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the scholars on Kazakhstan's foreign policy, the
foreign minister pointed out that Kazakhstan's geographical
position provides it with favorable conditions to co-operate with
both the eastern and western countries.
</P>
<P>
To develop good-neighborly relations with the surrounding
countries is one of the starting points of Kazakhstan's foreign
policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tokayev said that China is a great nation and playing an
important role in the establishment of a new world order and other
issues.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan-China relations are built on the basis of equality
and mutual benefit, he added.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the two countries have maintained exchanges of
high-level visits. Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev visited
China in 1993 and 1995, while Chinese Premier Li Peng visited
Kazakhstan in 1994.
</P>
<P>
China and Kazakhstan signed a joint declaration on further
developing their friendly relations last year, and the two
governments signed a group of documents including an agreement on
using China's port city of Lianyungang to transport Kazakhstan's
goods.
</P>
<P>
Tokayev held that Kazakh-Chinese relations are about to "enter
a new era."

<HEADLINE> Farmers Earn More in Southeast China Coastal Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The annual net income of rural
residents in southeast China's Fujian Province soared 30 percent
to 2,048 yuan in 1995, a provincial official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Five previously poor counties have eliminated poverty and one
quarter of the counties and cities in the province have become
better off, said Jia Qinglin, secretary of the Provincial
Committee of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
This is a remarkable progress for a region with a large
population and per capita occupation of farmland less than the
national average, jia said.
</P>
<P>
Endowed with a mild climate, a long coastline and vast tracts
of forest, the province has developed a diversified economy by
opening up marine and mountain resources, and boosted the growth
of rural industry in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Fujian harvested 6.6 million tons of non-grain products in
1995, representing a 12.3 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The output value of rural businesses was 266.8 billion yuan
last year, accounting for one third of the provincial
total.

<HEADLINE> Water Situation In Harare Still Critical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Despite the heavy rains that
have pounded most parts of Zimbabwe since the rainy season began
in November, the water situation in Harare is still critical and
measures to curb consumption will remain in force.
</P>
<P>
A senior municipal officer said on Tuesday that the city
council was unlikely to lift water rationing until the water
levels in the two main supply dams, Chivero and Manyame, are
respectively more than 80 and 50 percent full.
</P>
<P>
The greater Harare area is supplied by Lake Chivero, Manyame,
Seke Dam and Harava Dam, but only Lake Chivero has been pumping
water as the other dams dried up due to the drought of last year.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is still not good. The water task force met
last week and it decided that water rationing would not be
lifted," the officer said.
</P>
<P>
Harare's weekly consumption has dropped to between 300 to 330
megalitres from 500 megalitres since the council introduced water
rationing last year after the drought.

<HEADLINE> China Plans Rules for State Procurement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- China is planning a series of
rules, including those for state procurement from the domestic
market, to protect and promote the development of its immature
hi-tech industries, a senior Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled rules are for the purpose of encouraging
enterprises to intensify the research efforts and increase
investment in immature hi-tech industries and avoid unfair
international competition, said Deng Nan, vice-minister of the
State Science and Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
The departments involved are considering drawing up policies
and rules including "seller's credit" and "buyer's credit" in
favor of these industries, she said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ruiming, an official of the State Science and Technology
Commission in charge of hi-tech industry, said that China's
immature hi-tech industries are being pounded by international
competition.
</P>
<P>
Because of dumping and unfair competition from some foreign
manufactures, he said, some Chinese hi-tech products do not sell
well in China in spite of their better quality and much lower
prices, which has affected the development of hi-tech industries
in China.
</P>
<P>
According to relevant rules in some Western countries,
government departments must give priority to domestically made
products when they match or are even lag a little bit behind their
international counterparts in terms of quality and price.

It was the second consecutive year that a record harvest was
achieved in the area.
</P>
<P>
It has turned Hebei from a grain import province into a grain
supplier in China, said a local agricultural official.
</P>
<P>
Cotton output amounted to 3.5 million tons. The output of
oil-bearing crops, vegetable, fruits, meat and eggs also
registered considerable rise.
</P>
<P>
Township-run enterprises made remarkable progress, with annual
output hitting 332 billion yuan, six times of the figure in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income of rural residents reached 1,530 yuan (184
U.S.Dollars) in 1995, 1.4 times more than the 1990 figure.
</P>
<P>
The province has diverted water from the Yellow River as part
of a farmland construction program. It is the second largest
irrigation scheme of its kind in China. Comprehensive agricultural
developments and new agro-techniques have also been introduced to
help crop yields.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- China will invest ten billion

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) has offered a counter-trade deal to
purchase 130,000 tons of rice from Thailand, according to sources
from the Thai Commerce Ministry today.
</P>
<P>
The rice, worth 13.7 million US dollars, is part of a total
purchase of 300,000 tons agreed by the DPRK last year. Only
170,000 tons were delivered and the contract expired at the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang has asked to renew the contract but under a
counter-trade with steel and fertilizers, or installment payments.
</P>
<P>
The contract of 300,000 tons of rice is the second deal for
which payment has not been made, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, DPRK bought 100,000 tons of Thailand's broken rice.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Rice Policy Committee will determine whether the
contract can be renewed and whether the offer is acceptable, said
the sources.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Thailand Needs to Do More to Protect  Foreign Tourists  (by Yu Zuncheng) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Although Thailand has been
acclaimed as a favorite tourist destination in Southeast Asia,
there are problems that call for immediate solution.
</P>
<P>
Among them are cheating, theft, drugs and safety of foreign
tourists.
</P>
<P>
The first three problems "are the real destroyers of the
tourism industry," said Pradech Phayakvichiena, deputy governor of
the Tourism Authority of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The country needs to implement protection measures, such as
price and quality controls for souvenirs or jewelry, and closing
down of shops that cheat tourists.
</P>
<P>
Although murders, unnatural deaths and raping of foreign
tourists are reported occasionally, Pradech said that murder is
not the main problem compared with other crimes involving
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
A total of 9,560 cases of theft and 731 cases of jewelry scams
were reported last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yodchat Suaphu, a monk in western Thailand, killed British
tourist Johanne Masheder last December and was later sentenced to
death.
</P>
<P>
The murder cast a dark shadow over the image of Thailand's
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's tourist police force is simply not
sufficient to deal with the criminals plying on foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
Thailand had only 914 tourist policemen to take care of 6.9
million foreign tourists who came to Thailand last year.
</P>
<P>
It seems necessary for the tourist police to expand their force
and shift their work from public relations to dealing more harshly
with criminals.
</P>
<P>
If the problems are not solved soon, Thailand will no longer be
seen as a "land of smiles."

<HEADLINE> Experts Appeal to Protect Dinosaur Fossils in Yellow Mountain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts are appealing
for protection of dinosaur fossils discovered in the Yellow
Mountain in east China's Anhui Province in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the China Geology and Mineral
Resources News, last year fossils of dinosaur bones, eggs, feet
and tail traces were discovered within an area of 100 sq km in a
famous scenic spot in the Yellow Mountain area.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of fossils of dinosaur's bones, eggs and traces
at the same time is rare in the world.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, as a result, has attracted the attention of
experts both at home and abroad, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But most of the fossils are buried in scenic spots or in areas
near roads and villages, where frequent human activities are prone
to destroy these geological relics.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 biologists and geologists made an appeal for immediate
maximum protection of the fossils and for more research, after

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, February 14 (Xinhua) -- During the past five years
southeast China's Fujian Province has ratified the setting up of a
total of 14,800 foreign-funded enterprises, 4.8 times the figure
during the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises involve 35.2 billion US dollars in contracts,
more than 13 times the figure during the 1986-1990 period.
</P>
<P>
Last year provincial foreign-funded enterprises generated
almost 73 billion US dollars in industrial output value and 4.8
billion US dollars in foreign exchange, accounting for 44.9
percent and 51.5 percent of local total, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Of the enterprises set up during the past five years, 10 are
share-holding companies, and 29 are group enterprises; the number
of exclusively foreign-owned enterprises exceeds that of
Sino-foreign joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Such enterprises are becoming more involved in capital- and
technology-intensive projects, and transfer labor-intensive items
to provincial mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises run businesses in the fields of agriculture,
industry, construction, tourism, real estate, public facilities
and services. Among them, the industrial sector enjoys the largest
investment, accounting for six percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Attracting overseas funds from 58 countries and regions during
the 1991-1995 period, the enterprises injected 59.47 percent of
contractual investment into industrial projects and 39.53 percent
into service items.

<HEADLINE> Keating Compromises on Republic Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
Paul Keating today made a compromise on the methods for electing
an Australian to be head of the state.
</P>
<P>
Launching the Labor Party's election campaign in Melbourne, he
said that a Labor government would, within 12 months after the
March 2 election, hold a universal poll on what kind of republican
model Australia would have.
</P>
<P>
Keating has made a major compromise on his stand on the
republic issue. He used to insist that a referendum be held on the
government's proposal for the Queen of Britain and
Governor-General to be replaced by a head of state elected by a
two-thirds majority of the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
But opinion polls showed that most Australians wanted a
directly-elected president, instead of the parliament-elected one
proposed by Keating.
</P>
<P>
"Paul Keating must make clear that his model is not the only
one to be examined," Democratic Party leader Cheryl Kernot said
today.
</P>
<P>
Keating said that the government had never suggested that its
model was the only one.
</P>
<P>
He said that a joint select Committee would be set up with
members of both houses of the parliament to consult widely on
other options of the republican model.
</P>
<P>
Taking into consideration the results of the plebiscite and
opinions of the states and communities, the committee will make
recommendations on which republican model suits Australia best and
put relevant institutional amendment to a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Kernot said that the plebiscite would be a good starting point
to decide whether Australians would have a direct say in the
election of the head of state.
</P>
<P>
With Labor still trailing the Liberal-National coalition half
way through the election campaign, Keating used the republic issue
to show the difference between Labor's policies and the
coalition's.
</P>
<P>
Opposition coalition leader John Howard advocated that an
institutional convention would be held to discuss whether
Australia should become a republic or not.
</P>
<P>
Keating accused Howard of adopting a conservative stand on the
republic issue.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party has stated that a republic would improve
Australia's sense of national identity and would help build links
with Asia.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that this election is the most cynical one in the
country's history, because the policies of the major parties have
no significant difference.
</P>
<P>
The Labor government is keen to distinguish itself from the
"copy-cat" opposition in order to turn the tide around in the
latter half of the election campaign.

<HEADLINE> China Calls For Elimination of All Nuclear Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Nuclear disarmament is
unquestionably a priority of our times and it is high time to ban
nuclear weapons in the same way as chemical and biological
weapons, Chinese ambassador Wang Xuexian said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference on "Non-Proliferation and the
Millennium: Prospects and Initiatives" held in Washington on
Monday and Tuesday, Wang urged nuclear states to unconditionally
pledge non-first use and not to use weapons of mass destruction
against non-nuclear states.
</P>
<P>
"We must therefore roll up our sleeves and conclude a binding
treaty on non-first use. As for negative security assurances, we
must not stop at United Nations Security Council Resolution 984,
but should take further steps to provide unconditional security
assurances to all non-nuclear states in a legally binding form,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the Non-Proliferation Treaty which was extended
indefinitely last May has three pillars: prevention of nuclear
proliferation, international cooperation in the peaceful use of
nuclear energy and the promotion of nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"Nuclear non-proliferation is a worthy objective, but should
not be pursued at the expense of international cooperation in
the peaceful uses of nuclear energy to foster economic and social
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the banning of nuclear tests, Wang said that China attached
great importance to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
negotiations and hoped to see a good treaty concluded as early as
possible, and no later than the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
"While we strive to conclude the treaty early, we should set a
high standard for the treaty. Speed is no reason to compromise
quality," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"In the CTBT, we need a treaty that will stand the test of
time. We must not negotiate a treaty for its own sake, let alone
time the negotiations to coincide with any domestic political
schedule," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The CTBT should not hamper or restrict scientific and
technological development and its peaceful applications," he
added.

</P>
<P>
On the same day, senior intellectuals gathered in the
auditorium of the autonomous region's United Front Work Department
there.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the gathering, Danzim, deputy secretary of the
party committee of the autonomous region of Tibet, said, "Tibet's
economic take-off and invigoration relies largely on concerted
efforts and unity of all intellectuals of various ethnic groups."
</P>
<P>
Tibet enjoyed social stability in 1995, with reforms stepped up
and opening wider to the outside world, according to local
government officials.
</P>
<P>
Great changes in Tibet have brought more Tibetans living abroad
to back home to visit their relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, some 1,000 Tibetans residing abroad returned to the
regional capital of Lhasa alone, and 24 of them have settled down
there.
</P>
<P>
To help ensure the returned Tibetans to have a happy Tibetan
New Year, the regional government held a reception for them and
their families in Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh Ready for National Polls  (by Jiang Xianming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- While the whole nation has been
covered by smoke of gun-bomb powder due to a government-opposition
conflict, Bangladesh's Election Commission (EC) has announced that
all necessary steps have been completed to hold the national
elections on February 15.
</P>
<P>
After the duty-finished 5th parliament was dissolved by
President Abdur Rahman Biswas last November, the EC decided to
hold the next parliamentary elections to fulfill its
constitutional obligation. Since the opposition and the government
could not reach a compromise over the long-disputed issue of
formation of a neutral caretaker government to supervise the
polls, the EC finally fixed February 15 as the polling date after
shifting the polls schedule several times.
</P>
<P>
The arrangements to conduct the polls have been completed in
all the six administrative divisions of the country having 491
police stations and 4,460 unions (the lowest level administrative
unit), the EC said last night, adding that the polling begins at
8:00 a.m. and ends at 4:00 p.m. Thursday without any break
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the EC, 1,450 candidates are contesting for 252
parliamentary seats in the polls, 993 of them as nominees of the
ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party and other 40 small parties and
the remaining 457 as independent candidates.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, 46 candidates from 48 constituencies were elected
without contest.
</P>
<P>
In preparing the polls, the EC has set up 21,106 polling
stations and 98,710 polling booths while 56.16 million citizens
out of nearly 120 million people have registered as voters.
</P>
<P>
Each constituency has an average of 34 polling stations and
187,211 voters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EC has appointed 66 returning officers in 64
districts, 506 assistant returning officers and 317,236 polling
officers to conduct the polls.
</P>
<P>
In order to hold the polls in an impartial, free and fair
manner, the army has been deployed in different parts of the
country to assist other law-enforcing agencies for recovering
illegal arms as a precaution to check violence as a sequel to
anti-polls activists.
</P>
<P>
The EC has also called in the services of the armed forces to
ensure peace during the polling day and banned all sorts of public
meetings, processions and rallies for 48 hour from midnight
Wednesday in view of possible violent resistance program by the
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
However, the mainstream opposition parties have vowed to resist
the "one-party farcical elections" at any cost. They began a
countrywide 48-hour strike at 06:00 this morning.
</P>
<P>
Actually, anti-polls violent incidents have occurred one after
another in recent days, leaving some people killed, hundreds
injured and hundreds of motor vehicles damaged or set on fire.
</P>
<P>
People are worried about a more violent confrontation between
the anti-polls activists and the law-enforcing agencies and the
polls supporters during the polling day.
</P>
<P>
Any violation of the election conduct, election law and rules
would not be allowed and the violators would be liable to rigorous
imprisonment from two to seven years with fines, the EC warned.

<HEADLINE> Chile Takes the Lead In Forest Exploitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Chile has been able to
consolidate its place as a world leader in the forestry industry
at a level similar to the developed countries, said a research
scientist at the University of Chile today.
</P>
<P>
Andres Weintraub of the university's Industrial Engineering
department said that exports of forest products from Chile totaled
2.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1995, an increase of 51.1 percent over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The increase came after sophisticated mathematical models were
incorporated into the forest production management of forestry
companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The models enabled companies to be more efficient and to cut
costs by between 15 and 30 percent, said the scientist.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
enjoyed fruitful results in its export-oriented economy during the
past five years. Total foreign trade hit almost 43 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Provincial foreign trade last year accounted for more than a
quarter of all local production.
</P>
<P>
The five years saw the province give the go-ahead to 25,300
foreign-funded projects, attracting contractual overseas
investment worth 29 billion US dollars
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment came from more than 80 countries and
regions during the 1991-1995 period - compared to investors from
25 countries and regions during the previous five-year period.
</P>
<P>
More than 25 percent of local total investment in fixed assets
stemmed from overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
The province has three state-level economic technological
development zones in Qingdao, Yantai, and Weihai, and at least 50
province-level zones across the whole area. This has helped to
promote local economic contacts with foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Besides an annual foreign trade fair hosted in Qingdao, the
province also held trade promotion activities in Japan, the United
States, the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, and Germany in the
1991-1995 period.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen persons, including
the driver of the truck found parked in a temple premises last
Monday in Sri Lanka's capital Colombo loaded with high explosives,
have been arrested, police sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
The driver, Balakumaran, was arrested at Vavuniya in the North
Central Province when he was attempting to make his getaway to
Kilinochchi where the owner of the truck is reportedly residing.
</P>
<P>
The truck owner's wife was also arrested at Vuvuniya where she
was residing.
</P>
<P>
A three wheeler which had been gifted to Balakumaran by Tamil
rebels and which was being used by him, was also seized.
</P>
<P>
Eleven others, all natives of Jaffna, have also been arrested.
Among them is Sidhadaran, the broker who made the arrangements for
the vehicle to be parked at the temple premises.
</P>
<P>
The truck, believed to be used in another massive blast in
Colombo, was packed with 12 metal cases containing high
explosives. The explosives were so packed that only connecting
wires had to be fixed onto the dashboard to activate the
explosives.
</P>
<P>
The temple premises is generally rented out to truck owners who
transact business in Colombo. While the other trucks made their
routine trips, this particular truck remained for a few days,
thereby arousing suspicion.
</P>
<P>
A bomb blast caused by Tamil rebels at the Central Bank in
Colombo killed about 80 people and injured more than 1,200 others
on January 31.

<HEADLINE> Moonies in Mass Wedding Charged in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine National Bureau
of investigation (NBI) has filed criminal charges against four
officials of the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of
World Christianity, known as "moonies," the local press said
today.
</P>
<P>
According to NBI Director Santiago Toledo, the four officials
include two South Koreans -- Sun Myung Moon and Chung Hwang Kwak
-- and two Filipinos -- retired National Police Chief
Superintendent Honesto Bumanglag and Federico Niduasa.
</P>
<P>
The four moonies officials are charged with violating the law
against mail-order brides.
</P>
<P>
If found guilty, the four officials will be sentenced to a
maximum of eight years' imprisonment and fined 20,000 pesos (800
US dollars). Moon and Chung will be barred from entering the
country.
</P>
<P>
Chung is also accused of violating the revised penal code after
he solemnized the supposed marriages without the authority of the
law. He is facing another four years' imprisonment for this.
</P>
<P>
Niduasa and Bumanglag recruited mostly local moonies while
Chung officiated the mass wedding.
</P>
<P>
The 984 couples who participated in the mass wedding in Manila
on January 23 are also liable to charges of violating the revised
penal code as all of them had no valid marriage licenses.
</P>
<P>
The NBI, the Bureau of Immigration and the Philippine Overseas
Employment Administration will send a joint team to South Korea to
conduct further investigation into Filipino moonies.

<HEADLINE> Chile Lists MERCOSUR Membership as Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Chile's integration with
South America, in particular with the Southern Cone Common Market
(MERCOSUR), is the priority in its foreign policy, Foreign Minister
Jose Miguel Insulza said here today.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental policy of the Chilean government is to seek
closer ties with its neighbors, he told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that the signing of an agreement for establishing a
free trade zone between Chile and the Mercosur, made up of Brazil,
Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina, is one of the most important
matters he discussed today with his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz
Felipe Lampreia.
</P>
<P>
Insulza pointed out that Chile attaches utmost importance to
President Eduardo Frei's visit to Brazil on March 25-28, adding
that Frei will be accompanied by a delegation of entrepreneurs
interested in investing in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Chile and Brazil has grown substantially,
reaching about 2.5 billion U.S. dollars last year, Insulza said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that contacts between the two countries' economic
organizations will increase and this will be conducive to bilateral
trade and investments.

<HEADLINE> American Teachers Stress Computer Literacy Over  Classics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Less than 25 percent of 1,164 teachers listed classic works
by Shakespeare and Plato, or works by American authors such as
Ernest Hemingway or John Steinbeck, as "absolutely essential."
</P>
<P>
In contrast, at least 70 percent of the teachers ranked the
three R's (reading, writing, and arithmetic), the value of hard
work, citizenship, computer skills and U.S. history and geography
as essential components of the public school curriculum.
</P>
<P>
"They don't think Shakespeare is the be-all, end-all for kids,"
said Steve Farkas, who worked on the survey released Tuesday by
Public Agenda. "Computer skills emerge from the pack because the
teachers connect that with survival in the real world."
</P>
<P>
Of factors that might determine career success, teachers place
"an excellent academic education" a distant third, with only 21
percent saying it is the most important factor. Persistence and
inner drive, and knowing how to deal well with people, rank first
and second, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that teachers support higher standards
for students, but they are more concerned about pressures from
social problems, lack of funding, overcrowded classrooms and a
lack of parental involvement.
</P>
<P>
Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association,
the nation's largest teachers union, said he was glad to see that
the teachers and general public both put basic reading, writing
and math skills at the top of the list of "absolutely essential"
curriculum items.
</P>
<P>
Ranking computers over classics reflects teachers' pragmatism,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think teachers believe they have a lot more students in
their classrooms who will have jobs that require dealing with
computers than with reading the classics," Geiger said. "We have
to prepare these kids to get jobs."
</P>
<P>
The teachers' attitudes on public education were based on a
telephone survey of the 1,164 teachers in grades 4 through 12
completed in December and a survey of 237 public school teachers
in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
General public data was collected in May 1995 in a national
telephone survey of 1,200 adults and a nationwide mail survey of
1,151 community leaders.
</P>
<P>
The margin of error for both surveys was plus or minus 3
percentage points.

DHAKA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's mainstream
opposition parties began a nationwide strike today to resist what
they call "farcical" national elections scheduled for Thursday.
</P>

The non-stop strike began at 6 o'clock this morning and will
end at 6 o'clock Thursday evening, which coincides with the
polling.
</P>
<P>
According to press statements of the opposition parties last
night, vehicles engaged in emergency services, including
ambulance, fire services, water, gas and electricity supplies,
garbage cleaning lorries, vehicles carrying journalists,
newspapers and corpses as well as medical shops and hotels are
exempted from the strike.
</P>
<P>
The strike is part of the opposition's current campaign against
the national elections.
</P>
<P>
They are boycotting the poll process because the ruling party
has rejected their demand for the resignation of the prime
minister and holding of the elections under a non-party neutral
caretaker government.

medium-sized enterprises are becoming the main propellant force in
Poland's transition toward a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Latest official figures show that these enterprises have come
to account for half of the country's gross domestic product and
employ 60 percent of the nation's labor force.
</P>
<P>
Yet only 15 percent of these enterprises are profit makers
whereas 45 percent of them have a difficult time making ends meet.
</P>
<P>
Setting up small and medium-sized enterprises has been a trend
since 1989 when the country started its privatization program in
the hope of revitalizing its economy.
</P>
<P>
Though more Polish families are turning to running small
enterprises, a lack of know-how has been hindering the development
of the private sector of the national economy.

KIEV, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine has to bet on its
Zaporozhskaya nuclear power plant after Russia cut off power
supply to the country.
</P>
<P>
All the six generators at Zaporozhskaya were operated at full
capacity on Monday and provided upwards of one-fifth of the
nation's electricity.
</P>
<P>
The Russians stopped supplying electricity to Ukraine on late
Monday afternoon on the excuse that the country had exceeded its
historical record of energy consumption, according to the
Ukrainian Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
The stoppage aggravated the power shortage caused by the
partial shutdown of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and a
nationwide strike by coal miners earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Thermal power plants now generate less than one-third of the
country's electricity.

<HEADLINE> Gramm to Drop Out of U.S. Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Battered by defeats in the
first two GOP caucuses in Louisiana and Iowa, U.S. Senator Phil
Gramm indicated tonight that he would quit the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Gramm, who was the first Republican to began his presidential
run earlier last year, told his top supporters around the country
that he had planned a press conference on Wednesday afternoon in
Washington to announce his retreat from the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Texas Senator, who had expected clear-cut victories in the
first two Republican tests, was defeated by conservative
commentator Pat Buchanan in the Louisiana caucuses last week and
came a dismal fifth in the Iowa caucuses on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gramm said before the two votes that he would drop out of the
race if he could not finish at least in third place.
</P>
<P>
Gramm's departure would leave an eight-man GOP field, with one
week to go before the New Hampshire primary on February 20.
</P>
<P>
It would remove from the race a dogged campaigner who early on
was widely regarded as the biggest threat to U.S. Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole, the GOP's front-runner in the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
GOP sources said that Gramm took the decision after he
consulted with some of his top advisers. Several of Gramm's
supporters had urged him to quit the campaign and concentrate on
his Texas Senate race.
</P>
<P>
Gramm raised some 25 million U.S. dollars for his campaign, but
critics said that he had not used the money wisely.

<HEADLINE> Soil Erosion to Be Curbed on Upper Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Each year from now on, China
will bring under control 10,000 sq km of land suffering from soil
erosion on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, China's
longest, a national conference was told here today.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze originates in Qinghai Province, and runs through
Yunnan, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu
provinces before it reaches the sea at Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
A survey has shown that 350,000 sq km of land on the river's
upper reaches, or one third of the entire Yangtze River Valley,
suffers from soil erosion. Some economists have warned that the
Yangtze is becoming almost as silted up as the notorious Yellow
River.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to painstaking efforts over the past seven years, 39,000
sq km of eroded land have been harnessed, according to a national
conference on water and soil conservation on the upper reaches of
the Yangtze now in session in this capital city of northwest
China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of experts, local farmers have divided the
vast eroded area into small plots and harnessed them one by
one. Building terraced fields and planting trees have proved to be
the most efficient ways of curbing soil erosion. Government
investment in this respect has increased year by year, jumping to
118 million yuan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
To date, 298,000 ha of eroded land have been turned into
fertile farmland, producting an additional output of 1.8 billion
kg of grain a year. Economic forests covering 386,600 ha have been
developed, yielding an annual output value of 2.2 billion yuan.

STOCKHOLM, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Norway recently got the
European Union Grand Prix for Tourism and Environment, a prize
awarded annually to a country doing best in the field.
</P>
<P>
A jury of 250 experts praised Norway as a perfect example
of combining tourism development with nature protection.
</P>
<P>
Norway defeated more than 30 countries, including major
competitors Canada, New Zealand and Switzerland, to win the prize,
sponsored by the famous German tourism magazine, Holiday.
</P>
<P>
Norway, with a population of only 4 million, in 1995 attracted
some 3.2 million foreign tourists, most of them Europeans.
</P>
<P>
Being a big foreign currency earner, tourism contributed as
much as 2.8 billion U.S. dollars to the Nordic country in the year.
</P>
<P>
The 1994 Winter Olympics held in Lillehammer helped promote the
nation's tourism, with an increasing number of tourists pouring in

MOSCOW, February 14 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin on
Tuesday stressed the need to develop science, describing it as one

"It must be clear to all -- both to state bodies and society --
that we will not be able to resolve the problem of the renovation

in the filed of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Famous Russian scientists Andrei Slovnov and Lyudvig Fadeyev,

<P>
Yeltsin called on the government to create favourable
conditions for science development and bring into play the
intellectual potential of the country.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that Russian scientists are now living in hard
conditions, and Russia's prestige with regard to science and
education has been falling.

However, Yeltsin continued, urgent measures have been taken to
rectify this situation.
</P>
<P>
"I think in the near future, scientists will find themselves in
better conditions," he said.

According to the Itar-Tass news agency, the Russian Finance
Ministry has allocated 50 billion roubles (11 million U.S.

MANILA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Supreme Court
has upheld the election of President Fidel Ramos in 1992 as it
dismissed a protest against him filed by Sen. Miriam Defensor
Santiago, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
Voting eight to five, the Supreme Court, sitting as the
Presidential Electoral Tribunal, Tuesday dismissed as "moot and
academic" Santiago's protest against Ramos' election for alleged
massive fraud.
</P>
<P>
The 23-page decision rejected Santiago's protest, saying that
"in assuming the office of senator, Santiago has effectively
abandoned or withdrawn this protest."
</P>
<P>
The denial of Santiago's protest also led to the dismissal of
the president's counter-protest.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos garnered 5.3 million votes as against
Santiago's 4.4 million in the 1992 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Santiago filed a protest against the election result on July
20, 1992, and Ramos filed his counter-protest in September 1992.

northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region injected a record
24.76 billion yuan-worth of fixed assets in basic industry work.
</P>
<P>
Of them, 960 million yuan was used for agriculture, 2.6 times
the figure during the 1986-1990 period, 5.5 billion yuan for the
energy industry, a rise of nearly 100 percent, and five billion
yuan more for transportation and telecommunications, up 730
percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year the region made a total of 16.8 billion yuan in
production value.
</P>
<P>
The region has led northwest China for many years in per capita
grain availability, with average annual grain output during the
1991-1995 period rising 327 million kg from that in the 1986-1990

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Scientists are trying to
figure out how to mate a pair of endangered Chinese river dolphins
now being kept at separate locations.
</P>
<P>
Artificial insemination is not reliable, and transportation of
either animal is risky, so for now it will have to be a
long-distance love affair.
</P>
<P>
The couple faces a heavy burden. There are fewer than 100 of
the Chinese river dolphins left, and experts warn they will
extinct within 25 years if further action is not taken.
</P>
<P>
During a two-day seminar, experts and officials gathered in
Beijing to discuss the river dolphins' dilemma.
</P>
<P>
Participants agreed that catching and breeding more Chinese
river dolphins should be put at the top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The next catching season will begin in March.
</P>
<P>
Some reserves will be forced to abide by decisions made at the
seminar and transfer their dolphins to other places for breeding,
if there are no objections from local governments or the National
Environmental Protection Agency in the next month.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
province will reinforce administrative management of its social
security affairs in an attempt to improve the system.
</P>
<P>
This year, the Guangdong Social Security Bureau will be renamed
the Guangdong Social Security Administrative Bureau (GSSAB), and
given full responsibility for managing the social security
industry and its funds.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, 80 percent of cities and counties in the
province had set up social security bureaux to reinforce the
management system.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Guangdong successfully expanded its social insurance
coverage, ensuring a better living standard for retirees and
labourers.
</P>
<P>
Over 6.3 million citizens have taken part in the pension
insurance, 6.3 million in industrial accident insurance, 4.6
million in unemployment insurance, and more than 1.2 million in
child-bearing and medicine insurance.
</P>
<P>
The figures increased 0.96, 16, 12 and 10 percent respectively
from a year earlier.

<P>
Social insurance institutions paid more than four million yuan
last year as pensions, 16 percent up from 1994.
</P>
<P>
Retired people got an average 318 yuan pension monthly, a rise
of 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a hotline was set up in Guangdong to serve people

<HEADLINE> More People Shake off Poverty in West Hunan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 100,000 people have
escaped the poverty trap in the Autonomous Prefecture of Tujia and
Miao Nationalities in the western part of south China's Hunan
province.
</P>
<P>
Officials have spared no efforts in developing the local
economy to alleviate poverty.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture scored an annual GDP topping 4.92 billion yuan
in 1995, up 11.9 percent over the previous year, which enhanced
the average per capita income for farmers to 810 yuan.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that the prefecture had 600,000
poverty-stricken people, according to statistics compiled at the
end of 1994, accounting for 28.7 percent of the rural population
of the prefecture. A year later the figure had dropped to 500,000,
which was much less than the 1983 figure of 1.56 million poverty
stricken people.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture is determined to end poverty for everybody
within six years.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the target, the prefecture has introduced new
measures to improve farming conditions and is working hard to
build 50 commercial rice production bases in the villages and
towns.
</P>
<P>
The local authority invested 43 million yuan to help poor
villages develop mandarin orange growing, medicinal materials, tea
production and goat-raising.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the prefecture collected 13.86 million yuan and
set up 132 "hope primary schools", enabling over 30,000 dropouts
to return to school.
</P>
<P>
The poverty-alleviating efforts have produced marked
results. The prefecture reported a total agricultural product
value of 2.58 billion yuan in 1995, surging 10.9 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The grain output reached a record high of 756,000 tons and the
average per capita net income for farmers recorded an increase of
132 yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Charles
Millon today denied a news report in the daily Le Monde that the
government will cut its ground forces by half.
</P>
<P>
The report in today's Le Monde said the Ministry of Defense had
drawn up a plan to cut ground force regiments from 186 to 83,
reducing total troop numbers from 240,000 to 130,000 or 140,000.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that the cuts will also include 100 to 150
military bases in the country as well as the First Armored
Division stationed in Germany. The division is the main French
contingent in Eurocorps, which groups 50,000 soldiers from five
European countries.
</P>
<P>
Millon stressed at a press conference here today that the
government had made no decision to reduce the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the First Armored Division, Millon said any change
in the deployment of the French unit in Eurocorps "would only take
place after in-depth consultation ... with our European partners".
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac said in January that the role
of the military should be reformed to place greater emphasis on
its social and humanitarian mission.

<P>
HANGZHOU, February 14 (Xinhua) -- This capital of east China's
Zhejiang Province has experienced a sharp temperature rise of from
5-6 degrees celsius to 24 degrees celsius in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
This sudden change has made local residents put aside their
clumsy winter clothes and don fashionable spring clothes.
</P>
<P>
Walking around the Children's Palace beside the West Lake,
young girls are already wearing skirts, and young men are wearing
light shirts. This fashionable clothing has brought another scent
of spring to the West Lake.
</P>
<P>
Tourists can even find the willows along the West Lake budding,
following the several days of warm weather.
</P>
<P>
"The rise in temperature is attributed to the absence of a cold
front from the north and an active warm front from the southwest,"
said Zhu Ming of the Hangzhou Meteorological Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a rare phenomenon, though the temperature is a
little bit higher than in previous years. But the cold winter
season may return after February 15, when a northern cold front
arrives," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports of canned
and processed vegetables are forecast to expand by 9.3 percent
this year over last year, according to a report from the Business
Economic Department available here today.
</P>
<P>
Export value in the sector is expected to reach 4.7 billion
baht (188 million US dollars), compared with 4.3 billion baht (172
million US dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Canned baby corn and bamboo shoots had the largest share of
canned vegetable exports last year. Most other products recorded
gains, but exports of pickled vegetables fell.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a shortage of baby corn and bamboo shoots
this year could prevent exports from reaching their full
potential.
</P>
<P>
Frozen and chilled vegetable exports, totaling 2.5 billion baht
(100 million US dollars) last year, are expected to reach three
billion baht (120 million US dollars) this year.

<HEADLINE> Champion Xie Trails Three-Point in World Chess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAEN, Spain, February 13 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Reigning champion Xie
Jun of China failed to make her comeback when she split the point
with Hungarian challenger Zsuzsa Polgar in the ninth game of the
Women's Chess World Championship here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
While eight points are enough to retain her crown, Xie scored
only three points after the first nine games against six points
for the 27-year-old challenger.
</P>
<P>
The game was drawn after 37th move in more than three hours.
</P>
<P>
With the advantage of white pieces, the Hungarian initiated the
game with the Scottish variation of the Ruy Lopez opening.
</P>
<P>
Answered with her King's pawn, Xie, 26, managed to keep her
attacking momentum until the 27th move where she exchanged the
rooks with Polgar, which gave a breath to Polgar.
</P>
<P>
In the 29th move, Xie made one more error to capture the king
of Polgar at the sacrifice of her bishop, and failed to push ahead
her own king in her last-ditch efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Nowsdays, Xie is on her uphill slope to defend her title, and
I hope she will not loose her attacks in the later games," said
grand master Ye Jiangchuan, Xie's coach.
</P>
<P>
With a win worth of one point and a draw 0.5 point, challenger
Polgar has to score 8.5 points to wrest the title.
</P>
<P>
Xie dethroned Maya Chiburdanidze of Georgia to take the world
title in 1991 and beat another Georgian Nana Ioseliani for her
first defence in 1993.

<P>
During a meeting with visiting Chinese Minister for Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi this afternoon, Major said
the unpleasant period of time in Sino-UK relations has passed and

and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On her part, Wu said China would like to see the relations

</P>
<P>
As permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, China

The decisions made by the two countries would have a
long-lasting influence upon their surrounding regions, Major
added.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister said London enjoys a stronger
advantage in the fields of energy, aerospace, communications,
chemical industry and environmental protection. The two countries
could further cooperation in these fields, he added.
</P>
<P>
Major also expressed great confidence in the rapid development
of the Chinese economy, saying both the British government and
business community agreed the success of Chinese reform is a
miracle of the century.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Hong Kong, Major promised to strengthen
cooperation with the Chinese government in an effort to ensure a
smooth transition and transfer of government in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that Britain and China should make a joint
effort to ensure a smooth transfer of government in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Prior to her meeting with Major, Wu also held talks with Deputy
Prime Minister Michael Heseltine and exchanged views with him on
bilateral economic cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Central America seeks to
transform its dialogue with Mexico into a multilateral forum to
substitute the current bilateral relations, Costa Rican President
Jose Maria Figueres affirmed today.
</P>
<P>
The president analyzed the perspectives of the regional summit,
Tuxtla Gutierrez II, which will be held here on Thursday and
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Central American countries and Mexico met in the city
of Tuxtla Gutierrez, capital of Mexico's state of Chiapas, in
January 1991.
</P>
<P>
Figueres stressed that the context of this summit is very
different from the first one.
</P>
<P>
He said the Central American countries have signed an "alliance
for sustainable development," which maps out a common strategy and
will serve as the basis for agreements with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The summit will seek "the formalization of a privileged
association" between the Central American countries and Mexico,
according to the president.
</P>
<P>
Panama and Belize, which did not attend Tuxtla Gutierrez I,
will also participate in this summit.
</P>
<P>
On immigration, the Costa Rican president expressed his concern
over the safety of thousands of Central Americans who try to
cross, often without legal documents, no-man's land to
U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
As for anti-drug activities, the president said there are
countries with greater experience in the matter and they could
contribute to "integrated control programs" in the war against
drug-related crimes, including money laundering.
</P>
<P>
These issues should be included in a political declaration that
the eight presidents will sign here on Friday.

<P>
Of the total investment, 340 million yuan will be used to
reinforce embankments along the Minjiang, Jinjiang and Jiulong
rivers.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen big- or medium-sized reservoirs and eight water
diversion projects will be built in water-shortage areas in the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
A flood warning system, covering 38 counties and cities in the
area, will cost 150 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Power projects with a combined generating capacity of 330,000
kw will also be built in 25 counties.
</P>
<P>
The system also includes the construction of four polder areas
in rural Putian and Changle which will cost an estimated 370
million yuan.

The IMF is wary that the government's recent decrees to
increase social spending could ruin Russia's budgetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The talks will put Russia's economic course to a serious test,
Professor Richard Layard, an executive of the Russian-European
Center for Economic Policy, said at a news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the stability of Russia's currency and short-term
market, low inflational expectations and other macro-economic
variables have reassured Western economists about the recent
reshuffles in the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
As a major move in the reshuffle, former First Deputy Prime
Minister Anatolu Chubais, who was in charge of privatization in
the country, was replaced by Vladimir Kadannikov.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of Russia's credit and financial policy for 1996 was
mapped out during another talk with the IMF in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus is expected to attend
the final phase of the talks.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Experts Help Boost Economy in Liaoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Foreign experts are playing a
role in promoting local economic development in north China's
Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
The province invited a total of 196 foreign experts in 1995
and the results have already shown satisfactory economic returns.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that the province created an
additional product value of 370 million yuan last year by
introducing foreign expertise.
</P>
<P>
The effort of inviting foreign experts and introducing
expertise has stimulated the upgrading of technologies and the
development of new products in the province, said a local source.
</P>
<P>
Industrial projects accounted for 43 percent of the
expertise-introducing items, of which, some 60 percent are
connected with technological transformation in the old state-owned
enterprises of the province.
</P>
<P>
The Anshan Electric and Electronic Company, with the aid of an
expert from the Republic of Belarus, succeeded in developing a
series of radiator products in 1995, creating profit and taxes
totalling 900,000 yuan. And profit and taxes worth three million
yuan are expected to be produced this year.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, aided by German experts,
solved difficult technical problems with a large excavator.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of foreign experts and expertise is also
speeding up the pace of enhancing agricultural technologies and
alleviating poverty in the province.
</P>
<P>
Of the expertise items introduced, some 31 percent are
agriculture-related projects. Agricultural experts from the
Netherlands, Israel and the United States have effectively helped
various localities of the province to develop new breeds of
strawberries, corn products and poultry-raising technology.

<HEADLINE> Germany Urges Croatia to Help in Mostar Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 13 (Xinhua) -- German and American diplomats
today urged Croatia to exert its influence to resolve the crisis
arising from the division of the Bosnian city of Mostar.
</P>
<P>
Visiting German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said that the
European Union and the German government firmly support the plan
drawn up by the EU administrator in Mostar, Hans Koschnik, to
reorganize the city.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot say that the Croatian government has complete
influence on what is going on in Mostar, but there are still some
ways for Croatia to act there," Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
Under Koschnik's plan, Mostar will consist of three Croat
districts, three Muslim districts and one large district shared by
both ethnic communities.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was rejected by the Bosnian Croats and the
neighboring Croatian government.
</P>
<P>
Croatian Foreign Minister Mato Granic said that his government
wanted changes to Koschnik's plan but that it would try to seek a
compromise between Bosnian Croat and Muslim negotiators.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke also held
talks with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman on Tuesday on the
dispute over Mostar and the consequences for the Muslim-Croat
federation.
</P>
<P>
"President Tudjman reaffirms his full support for the Dayton
peace accord and his desire to see full compliance," Holbrooke
said after the talks.

<HEADLINE> Social Welfare Progressing in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The civil affairs departments in
the Tibet Autonomous Region are helping achieve social development
and stability in the region, according to a local official.
</P>
<P>
Ma Zebi, director of the Regional Department of Civil Affairs,
said that his department tries to provide better social security
and urban social welfare to local residents.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 natural disasters, including snow storms, droughts and
floods hit the region.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that these disasters affected about 350,000 residents,
and 38 percent of the crops, and killed 726,000 head of cattle,
sheep and yaks.
</P>
<P>
After a snowstorm hit Nagqu Prefecture in early 1995 the
Regional Civil Affairs Department allocated a total of nearly 22
million yuan in relief funds to aid the victims in solving
problems of food, heating and accommodation. It also sent
donations totaling 1.24 million and large amounts of grain and
clothing to the victims.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the prefecture's 196,000 victims were successfully
resettled, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Last year the civil affairs departments at various levels built
107 homes for the aged, which are taking care of 743 childless old
people, Ma said, adding that such homes across the region are now
taking care of a total of 8,000 old people.
</P>
<P>
The civil affairs departments also tried out a pension
insurance system in four counties, and the provision of community
services in the regional capital of Lhasa and Xigaze, another
major city in the region.
</P>
<P>
The region now has 45 enterprises run by civil affairs
departments, Ma said, adding that such enterprises manufacture
nine million yuan-worth of goods a year.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Pardons All But War Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Muslims and Croats
are pardoning all Serb combatants from persecution except for
indicted war criminals.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night the National Assembly of the Bosnian Federation
passed an amnesty law covering all combatants from the Bosnian war
which lasted for more than three and a half years.
</P>
<P>
The legislation was designed to allay the fears of the Serbs,
especially the residents in the Serb-held suburbs of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
A government statement, issued after the adoption of the law,
said that an amnesty is essential to the process of the
integration of the country.
</P>
<P>
It said, "This act enables Serbs to remain in parts of Sarajevo
which should revert to the Bosnian Federation under the peace
accords."
</P>
<P>
"By adopting this law, Bosnia has fulfilled one of its
obligations toward the peace accords," it said.
</P>
<P>
War criminals remain a critical issue in the peace process in
Bosnia ever since the Dayton peace accord was officially signed on
December 14 last year in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim-Croat federation is demanding the extradition of two
senior Bosnian Serb army officers for investigation by a war
tribunal in The Hague.

<HEADLINE> Temple of Heaven Plans to Attract More Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The world famous Temple of
Heaven in Beijing plans to receive an additional five million
visitors this year.
</P>
<P>
Officials say the boost for the 500-year old Temple will be
achieved by combining the functions of the temple as a museum and
park.
</P>
<P>
Director Jing Changshun said in the next few years, the temple
will be transformed into a high-level cultural tourism spot.
</P>
<P>
Jing said the temple expects more than 15 million visitors this
year, compared with an average 10 million in each of the past five
years. Among the visitors, 70 percent were local residents and 30
percent outsiders.
</P>
<P>
According to Jing, the interior part of the temple will serve
as a cultural museum and the external part will become a park for
local residents to rest and do morning exercises.
</P>
<P>
Built in 1421 and covering an area of 273 hectares, the temple
was China's largest site for imperial sacrificial rites in the
Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1911). It has entered the candidate
list of the world's cultural heritage.

SHENYANG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning, a heavy industrial
base in northeast China, has increased its budgetary
appropriations for agriculture, a weak link in the local economy,
by 99.5 percent over the past five years, a provincial
agricultural official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Government funds to agriculture-related projects totalled 6.9
billion yuan in China's Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995),
with an average increase of 17 percent each year, he added.
</P>
<P>
When a severe drought hit 134 ha of farmland early last year,
the provincial financial department earmarked 80 million yuan to
fight the drought and assist the spring farming.
</P>
<P>
The department also appropriated 200 million yuan to renovate a
breached dyke when floods struck last summer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, special funds have been allocated to expand
irrigated areas, develop the production of plastic sheeting for
farming and boost township-run enterprise growth.

<HEADLINE> Time Running Out For Keating in Election Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Labor
Government is still trailing the opposition as the federal
election campaign passed the half-way mark today, the latest
opinion polls showed.
</P>
<P>
The most optimistic public opinion poll, the Morgan poll,
showed that the Labor Party narrowed the gap with the
Liberal-National coalition by three percentage points over the
weekend, but was still two percentage points behind the opposition
coalition on a two-party preference basis.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the most prestigious polls such as the News
poll and the AGB McNair poll showed that Labor was lagging behind
the opposition by an average of eight percentage points in
supporting rates.
</P>
<P>
The results of the Morgan poll published today was played down
by both sides of the political rivals. The Labor team led by Prime
Minister Paul Keating is fully aware of the gloomy outlook for the
March 2 election. Reports from Labor candidates at grassroots
levels showed that Labor's policy failed to sink well into the
voters.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, meanwhile, kept pushing the "it's time" theme
in the campaign, saying that people want a change after 13 years
of Labor rule.
</P>
<P>
But local analysts said that the election campaign was most
boring and cynical one in history. The voters did not believe that
either Labor or the coalition would honor their election promises.
</P>
<P>
They said that differences between the two sides over policies
were so subtle that the voters showed no more interest in the
opposition's commitments than in what the Labor Government said.
</P>
<P>
People's tiresome feelings toward the major parties were also
reflected in the fact that a record 10 percent of voters would
gave their votes to small parties.
</P>
<P>
However, there is still no sign of major swing of voters in
some key marginal seats in the southern and eastern states, where
the opposition is expected to grab crucial extra seats to topple
the Labor rule.
</P>
<P>
Optimists from the Labor team argued that the coming election
would be much like the one in 1990, when the Liberal-National
coalition won the overall vote, but not in the seats it needed to
form a government.
</P>
<P>
A coalition strategist also confessed that it would be
difficult for the opposition to gain a majority in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Labor may lose five seats in Queensland
and New South Wales states each. But it will gain three seats in
Victoria and one in Western Australia.
</P>
<P>
Both sides admitted that the contest for marginal seats was
still close.
</P>
<P>
With no sign of miracle in sight half way into the election
campaign, Keating is to gear up Labor's drive for late recovery in
the election by highlighting the issue of republic. In the launch
of Labor's election campaign today in Melbourne, Keating is
expected to deliver a "powerful" strike on the opposition's stand
against having an Australian as the head of the country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women Swimmer Banned For Doping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. swimmer Jessica Foschi
was banned for two years by the country's swimming officials
today, more than six months after she was tested positive for a
strictly banned steroid.
</P>
<P>
Foschi, a 15-year-old distance swimmer, was tested positive for
the anabolic steroid, mesterolone, on August 4, 1995 at the United
States Swimming Summer Nationals in Pasadena, California.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Swimming officials, after a three-day hearing at Orlando,
Florida, said they find that under FINA rules, "a positive urine
test for an anabolic steroid creates a presumption of doping" and
decided that "Foschi is hereby suspended from competition for a
period of two years starting August 4, 1995."
</P>
<P>
But Foschi said she never knowingly used any banned substance.
</P>
<P>
The ban makes Foschi, a sophomore at Friends Academy in Old
Brookville, New York, ineligible for the Olympics in Atlanta this
summer.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Swimming officials also said the times achieved by Foschi
in any competitions from August 4, 1995 to February 13, 1996 are
stricken. But they added that "points, places and awards at such
competitions are unaffected."
</P>
<P>
Foschi was first given a probation by U.S. Swimming. The
probation was seen as too lenient and not in accordance with
international rules. So U.S. Swimming officials demanded a
two-year ban at the hearing.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia, Bulgaria Sign Accord on Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Vice-Premier and
Minister of Finance Jovan Zebic and Bulgarian Trade Minister
Atanas Paparizov signed here later today an agreement on
encouraging and protecting investments in both countries.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje
Kontic and his Bulgarian counterpart Jan Videnov told a press
conference that a two-day official visit to Yugoslavia by a
Bulgarian delegation, headed by Videnov, had been successful.
</P>
<P>
Videnov said economic deals had been prepared and would be
signed at a meeting of a Yugoslav-Bulgarian commission in Sofia on
March 6-7.
</P>
<P>
Videnov said the most important result of his visit was that
the leaders of the two countries had reached a common belief that
there was no turning back from the Balkan peace process, that all
agreements that had been reached should be implemented and that
all necessary conditions had already been created for stable and
peaceful cooperation in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"We are highly content that support has been offered for the
forthcoming foreign ministerial meeting of the Balkan states which
would be held in Sofia later this year as well as for preparation
of agreements on friendship and good-neighborly relations with
Yugoslavia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to renew traditional cooperation in border areas as
well as an agreement to this effect and thus turn the border
between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria into a European border where there
would be a free traffic of ideas, persons and goods," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian premier said that the two neighboring countries
would soon hold talks on setting up a free trade zone that would
help them join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kontic told reporters the talks had focused on
promotion of bilateral cooperation in the spheres of
machine-building industry, agriculture, ferrous and non-ferrous
metallurgy, power industry, transport, tourism and other spheres
as well.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Yugoslavia and Bulgaria had signed last
December an agreement on economic cooperation and trade giving
each other the most-favored nation status.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the annual trade volume of the two countries would soon
reach 500 million U.S. dollars" which would double the bilateral
trade before the U.N. imposed sanctions on Yugoslavia in May 1992,
Kontic said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav prime minister said he was pleased to say that
they had agreed to upgrade diplomatic relations between the two
countries to the ambassadorial level.
</P>
<P>
Videnov returned home later today after the two-day official
visit to Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> UK Factory Price Rises Subdued in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Prices of goods leaving British
factory gates fell back sharply last month, prompting the Treasury
to claim that inflationary pressures were easing and providing
prospects of further cuts in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Factory output prices, excluding volatile food, drink tobacco
and petroleum prices, were unchanged between December and January,
the Central Statistical Office (CSO) said Monday,
</P>
<P>
This was the first time prices were left unchanged since April
1994. Economists were surprised since manufacturers typically
increase prices in January as they revise their price lists.
</P>
<P>
Output prices, including the more volatile components, an
indicator closely watched by both the Treasury and the Bank of
England, rose by 0.4 percent last month, far less than usual for
the time of the year, and by 3.8 percent in the year to January,
the lowest annual increase since March 1995.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the ability of manufacturers to restrain prices
has been helped by falling world commodity prices and a more
stable pound.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers paid 0.3 percent less on average for their raw
materials and fuel last month than in December, taking the annual
rate down to 4 percent, from 5.9 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the latest data gave the Chancellor of Exchequer,
Kenneth Clarke, the perfect justification for a third cut in
interest rates since September.

<HEADLINE> UN Authorizes 50 More Troops for Macedonia Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council today authorized an increase of 50 troops in the
1,100-member U.N. Preventive Force in the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia (UNPREDEP).
</P>
<P>
The increase in strength is to replace a platoon of Indonesian
engineers on loan from the previous U.N. structure in the former
Yugoslavia, recently replaced by a NATO-led force in Bosnia and a
new U.N. operation in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
In adopting a resolution unanimously, the council also approved
the establishment of the position of force commander of the
UNPREDEP.
</P>
<P>
This action followed a recommendation by U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali that the UNPREDEP, formerly under the command
and control of the United Nations Peace Forces Headquarters in the
former Yugoslavia, be established as an independent mission,
reporting directly to the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
The president of the council has informed the secretary-general
that council members "agree in principle" with that recommendation.
</P>
<P>
The UNPREDEP was established as a deterrent to any spread of
conflict from other parts of the former Yugoslavia.

LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Plans for a 200 million pounds
(306 million US dollars) film and TV theme park which could create
3,000 jobs are to be opposed by local Tories, according to a BBC
TV report today.
</P>
<P>
The park, planned on green belt land in Hillington, west
London, is a joint venture between US entertainment giant Time
Warner and British broadcaster MAI.
</P>
<P>
They hope the park, to be built on a 150-acre site to the west
of London, will open in 1999 and draw two million visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
But three Tory MPs have expressed "total opposition" to the
plans. Micheal Shersby (Uxbridge) said the government must resist
any temptation to relax rules on building on green belt land.
</P>
<P>
A dry-ski slope and other sports facilities current on the site
would have to be moved.
</P>
<P>
But the companies are hopeful of council and government
approval, saying that the park would boost the local economy and
employ up to 3,500 people, including around 900 part-time and
full-time jobs in the park itself.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Stresses Importance of Urban Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Urban farming helps
lift hundreds of millions of people out of extreme poverty and is
improving health and nutrition of city-dwellers across the world,
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) reported today.
</P>
<P>
UNDP reported in its new book "Urban Agriculture: Food, Jobs
and Sustainable Cities" that 800 million people, including 100
million in China, are enaged in urban agriculture, which is
conducted in a city or suburbs no more than a day's trip from the
city center.
</P>
<P>
Urban agriculture ranges from growing crops on rooftops to
raising livestock in backyards and raising fish in ponds, lagoons
and streams. It produces one-seventh of world's food. In some
countries, half of all vegetables and poultry are produced in
urban areas, according to UNDP.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of urban families engaged in agriculture varies
from 10 in some large cities in North America to as many as 80 in
some smaller Siberian and Asian cities.
</P>
<P>
The importance of urban agriculture accelerated dramatically
throughout the world in the 1980s. Surveys in Moscow in 1970 and
1991 indicate a shift from 20 percent to 65 percent of families
engaged in agriculture. Surveys in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in
1967 and 1991 show an increase from 18 percent to 67 percent.
Studies in Kenya have also found that three out of every five
families in towns and cities are engaged in urban agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In addition to benefits of better nutrition, poverty reduction
and increase of jobs, urban agriculture is also good for
environmental protection, as it turns waste from a problem into a
resource, reduces the public cost of waste management and provides
a better living condition.
</P>
<P>
For instance, in Calcutta, sewage feeds 3,000 hectares of
lagoons, which produce 6,000 tons of fish each year. In the State
of California, 200 wastewater reclamation plants save nearly
800,000 cubic meters of water a day, with most the treated
effluent put to agricultural use.

<P>
LUANDA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- An Angolan government official
today accused formal rebel UNITA of not positively participating
in the country's peace process.
</P>
<P>
Higino Carneiro, the spokesman for the Angolan government in
the Joint Committee supervising the peace process in Angola, told
a press conference that the National Union for the Total
Independcence of Angola (UNITA) has made a lot of promises, but
it has not carried them out, resulting in the slow progress in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the former rebels to show their sincereity in
implementing the Angola Peace Accord signed by the government and
the UNITA in Lusaka, Zambia, in November l994.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka accord was accepted by the international community
and neither the government nor the UNITA has the right to make
any change of it, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said about 14,000 UNITA soldiers had been encamped so far
in four assembly points in the country, but they had handed over
only 54 kg of ammunitions.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the UNITA of the slow pace in freeing
government prisoners of war. enditem

<HEADLINE> Perry: NATO Troops to Watch Bosnian War Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S.-led NATO Bosnian peace
implementation forces (IFOR) have been instructed to closely watch
the movement of suspected Bosnian war criminals and detain them as
soon as possible, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at a photo opportunity with Croatian
Defense Minister Gojko Susak, Perry said that the NATO troops are
being given more photographs and intelligence information to help
them detain the Bosnian war criminals.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 Bosnian political and military officials have been
charged with war crimes by the internation war crimes tribunal in
the Hague, the Netherlands, but few have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Some of the Bosnian Serb officials suspected of war crimes
including Serb leader Radovan Karadzic have reportedly passed the
checkpoints of the NATO troops in the former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
"What we are describing is a tactical change of getting better
information so that they (troops) will have a better chance if
they see them of recognizing them and therefore being able to
detain them," Perry said.
</P>
<P>
Perry said that although the main purpose of IFOR checkpoints
is to prevent weapons and military forces out of the zones, the
NATO troops will detain the Bosnian suspects and turn them to the
international tribunal if they come across any checkpoints.

ANKARA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said today the
demonstration by Mujahideen Khalq, an Iraq-based Iranian
opposition to the Islamic revolution, against the Tehran
government was unauthorized.
</P>
<P>
The Mujahideen Khalq demonstration took place on Sunday in
front of the Iranian Embassy in Ankara, where the opposition group
burned down an Iranian flag.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Nurettin Nurkan expressed
Turkey's deep sorrow over the demonstration in a press conference,
noting that "flag burning is legally prohibited in our country
and it is againt the Turkish tradition which takes respect of
other countries' flags as a basis."
</P>
<P>
Nurkan said that the relevant authorities are conducting
the necessary inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA Tuesday reported that the
Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned the Turkish Ambassador to
Tehran and handed him a "strong protest" over Ankara's issuing of
a permit to supporters of the Mujahideen Khalq for a rally on
Sunday, the anniversary of Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Islamic Iran and secular Turkey have
improved in recent years after they agreed to stop groups opposed

<HEADLINE> NATO Reaffirms Support to the International Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, February 14 (Xinhua) -- NATO today reaffirmed its
strong support for the work of the International Criminal Tribunal
for the former Yugoslavia(ICTY) in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
In a press release after today's meeting of the Permanent
Council, NATO stressed that IFOR's main contribution was to
provide a secure environment, "in which other organisations, such
as the ICTY, can carry out their mission unimpeded".
</P>
<P>
"Our policy remains that IFOR will detain and transfer to the
ICTY persons indicted for war crimes by the Tribunal when it comes
into contact with such persons in carrying out their duties," it
said.
</P>
<P>
According to NATO, the ICTY is providing IFOR Headquarters with
all available information on the persons indicted for war crimes
and this information is being distributed to IFOR personnel.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it said, NATO would also provide logistical
support to the ICTY "case by case" on requests to the extent that
"IFOR's primary duties and available resource permit".
</P>
<P>
On Monday, 12 February, IFOR had provided a C-130 aircraft for
the transport of two Bosnian Serb officers "as suspect and
potential witnesses" from Sarajevo to The Hague for further
investigation by the Tribunal.

<HEADLINE> Quadripartite Meeting on Displaced Palestinians Reports Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The quadrilateral committee on
Palestinian refugees ended its two-day meeting here today with
tangible progress, an Egyptian official participating in the
meeting said.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Foreign Minister for Arab Affairs Badr Hamam, who
headed the Egyptian delegation to the meeting, said that the
committee was closer to its main objective of repatriating the
Palestinians displaced in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The Arab and Israeli negotiators agreed to draw up lists of the
refugees eligible for repatriation. They said they hope the lists
would be compiled before May 4, when the final-stage
Palestinian-Israeli talks begin.
</P>
<P>
The committee, in its seventh round of talks so far, also
discussed economic means for the Palestinian self-rule areas in
the West Bank and Gaza to absorb the displaced Palestinians,
according to Hamam.
</P>
<P>
He said that all negotiating parities, including Israel, the
Palestinians, Egypt and Jordan, showed their keenness on reaching
an agreement on the repatriation of the displaced Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But the negotiators failed to agree on the definition of the
displaced, an argument that so far has stalled the talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel insists that displaced Palestinians include only those
forced to flee their homes in the West Bank and Gaza in 1967.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iraq Reiterates Demand for Total Lifting of Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq reiterated today its
demand for a total lifting of embargo imposed on the country by
the U.N. Security Council following its invasion of Kuwait in
August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Minister of Culture and Information Abdul Ghani Abdul
Ghafour said that Iraq's cooperation with the U.N. Security
Council and its fulfilment of all its obligations toward U.N.
resolutions especially Resolution 687 oblige the Security Council
to implement para 22 of Resolution 687 as an introduction of the
total lifting of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the ongoing oil-for-food talks between Iraq and
U.N. will result in positive outcomes for Iraqi people who have
been suffering from the sanctions since 1990 when Iraq invaded
neighboring Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. Gulf war ceasefire resolutions, Iraq must
destroy all its nuclear, biological, chemical weapons and
long-range missiles before the sanctions can be hopefully lifted.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has time and again alleged that it has accomplished all
the requirements by the U.N. Security Council and demanded an
overall lifting of trade sanctions imposed on the country,
including the ban on its oil export, backbone of its economy.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. Special Commission in charge of the
destruction of Iraq's mass destruction weapons (UNSCOM), which
held frequent talks with Iraqi officials on Iraq's weapons
programs last year, has not visited Iraq since the beginning of
this year.
</P>
<P>
However, it seems that its mission is far from coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
Iraq recently began talks with the U.N. Security Council on the
export of limited quantity of oil to buy basic humanitarian
supplies within the framework of U.N. Resolution 986 adopted last
April.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has previously resisted the U.N. offer, saying the
resolution violated its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The change of Iraq's position toward the resolution is largely
because of the deteriorating economic situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Iraq most probably is facing difficulties in supplying Iraqis
with food for give-away prices on ration cards.

<HEADLINE> More Floodwater To Be Released From Mozambique's Dam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- More floodwater will be
released from the Cahora Bassa Dam starting from tomorrow, Xavier
Junior, an official in the Mozambican Ministry of Water
Conservancy announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Junior said the measure is to be taken for the safety of
the Cahora Bassa power station.
</P>
<P>
The floodwater discharge from the dam per second will be
increased from the present 1,600 cubic meters to 2,200 cubic
meters, he said, adding that it is likely to 3,200 cubic meters
per second if the water emptying into the dam remains at the
present level in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
At present, 3,700 cubic meters of water are emptying into the
dam per second, resulting in the constant rising of the dam's
water level, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the Zambeze River will rise sharply after
the increase of the dam's floodwater discharge, he said, adding
that people living in the Zambeze valley should be ready to
control possible flood. enditem
