<HEADLINE> Paris Court Rejects Case on World Cup Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A Paris court on Friday rejected a
case brought by some European Parliament members demanding the
redistribution of more than 700,000 World Cup tickets to give
foreign fans a fairer chance.
</P>
<P>
The Tribunal of Grand Instance of Paris said it could not rule
in the case because the deputies had themselves not tried to buy
tickets and therefore were unable to take legal action in the
interests of others or the general public.
</P>
<P>
Thirty European Parliament deputies sued the World Cup
organizers on charges of unfairly organizing ticket sales on May
20. The court had deferred its ruling until Friday.
</P>
<P>
The deputies said 2.5 million tickets distributed by the French
Committee of Organization of World Cup (CFO), the International
Federation of Football (FIFA) and the French Federation of
Football (FFF) were discriminatory because most of them were
reserved for French fans.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers, who are from Belgium, Britain, the Netherlands,
Germany, Greece, Austria, Italy and Denmark, demanded that the
712,484 tickets be redistributed to anyone who wished to watch the
matches, whatever his or her nationality.
</P>
<P>
But lawyers for the FFF, FIFA and CFO said tickets already sold
could not be redistributed and the sales had not violated European
Union rules.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Urges Clamp Down on Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 5 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin Friday urged
the federal government to put a squeeze on the budget deficit,
which, he said, is the most serious problem affecting Russia.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly national radio address, Yeltsin cautioned, "We
must learn to live within our means."
</P>
<P>
The president called for the creation of an "efficient and
flexible" tax system, accompanied by an "extremely firm" policy of
taxation.
</P>
<P>
He also demanded a "serious reduction in state spending."
</P>
<P>
Part of the present economic crisis was due to Russia's
inexperience in the market economy, the president said, stressing
that Russia had to adapt to the rules of the global economy,
guaranteeing in particular long term stability for investors.
</P>
<P>
The president urged Russian people to tighten their belts in a
bid to defuse the economic crisis which is currently threatening
prices and the stability of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
Austerity, he said, was needed in all sectors of society,
including "government, industry, banking and among ordinary
citizens".
</P>
<P>
"We are responsible for our own problems," said Yeltsin. He
said the government "will not allow" price increases to occur.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Rejects Liberalization of Law on Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Friday rejected the idea to liberalize France's law on crackdown
of drug trafficking and abuse which has been maintained since
1970.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting consecrated to the fight against drugs, Chirac
said that all 15 member states of the European Union (EU), except
the Netherlands, have similar laws against drug crimes.
</P>
<P>
"We should not liberalize that. Each time I met some
professionals, this idea reinforced. There is no prevention
without education. Moreover, there is no prevention without
banning," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also regretted that within EU the concertation is never
strong enough for an efficient common policy against drugs.
</P>
<P>
Some leftwing French politicians have suggested a loosening of
France's law on drugs, which they regard as too strict against
drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that the government should adopt a policy which is
both "humane and efficient" to treat drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
In France, a convicted drug addict should be imposed heavy
fines or given tough jail sentences.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Remains at 28-year Low in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate held
at a 28-year low of 4.3 percent in May as the robust economic
growth produced nearly 300,000 new jobs, offsetting fallout from
Asia's economic crisis, the Labor Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted rate matched that of April and was the
lowest since February 1970.
</P>
<P>
Employers added 296,000 jobs to their payrolls in May, nearly
matching the gain of 302,000 in April, which was revised up from
an early estimate of 262,000.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the stronger-than-expected report, which also
showed healthy wage gains, raised the prospect that the Federal
Reserve might raise interest rates later this year to slow
economic growth and thus nip any acceleration in inflation.
</P>
<P>
Job gains were strongest in services and retail sales. However,
manufacturers cut 26,000 positions and during the previous three
months had added only 2,000 jobs, which are regarded as related to
the Asian economic problems. From March 1996 to January 1998,
manufacturers added 370,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Some of the biggest losses in manufacturing came in the apparel
industry, down 9,000, and electronic equipment, industrial
machinery and autos.
</P>
<P>
Construction payrolls declined 9,000 in May, marking at least a
pause in what's been strong growth since last fall. Mining jobs
fell by 13,000.
</P>
<P>
Job growth was strong at temporary help firms, in data
processing and computers and in finance. Retail establishments
added 89,000 jobs, with especially robust growth occurring at
restaurants, department stores, drug stores and gift shops.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that strong demand for labor is
showing up in Americans' paycheck. Average hourly earnings rose 4
cents in May to 12.73 U.S. dollars after advancing 6 cents in April. The
average is 4.3 percent higher than a year ago, a substantial
amount considering inflation is hovering under 2 percent.

<P>
PARIS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government of Paris
Friday inaugurated a square in memory of the founder of the
football World Cup, Frenchman Jules Rimet, just four days from the
opening of the football finals.
</P>
<P>
The square is located near the Parc des Princes stadium of
Paris, which is one of the 10 stadiums across France to host the
matches.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was presided over by Paris Mayor Jean Tiberi and
attended by the great-daughter of Rimet, president of the
International Football Federation (FIFA) Joao Havelange, and the
president of Rimet Association Jean-Yves Guillain.
</P>
<P>
Rimet founded football World Cup in 1928, whose first matches
were held in 1930 in Uruguay. He also founded the League of
Football Association in 1910 to promote professionalism in sports.
</P>
<P>
Rimet, who was president of the French Football Federation from
1945 to 1949, died in 1956.

<HEADLINE> Heart Strokes Rise in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- After many years of decline, the
number of strokes in Canada has been accelerating sharply in the
past decade, says a study.
</P>
<P>
About 48,000 Canadians had strokes last year, and at least
6,000 were fatal. About 65 percent of the survivors were left with
paralysis, loss of speech or mental impairment, according to the
study released Thursday by the Heart and Stroke Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Within 10 years, the number of strokes in Canada could rise to
more than 60,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
As the population keeps aging, the totals could keep rising to
close to 80,000 a years within two decades.
</P>
<P>
"Only a small percentage of people are getting the message and
many of them tend to forget it," said Dr. Frank Silver, an Ottawa
neurologist on the board of the foundation.
</P>
<P>
A survey found that only 39 percent of Canadians can identify
even one of the symptoms of a stroke.
</P>
<P>
Another study found that only about half of the people would
seek immediate medical attention if they had one of the
symptoms: sudden dizziness, severe headache, weakness on one side
or inability to speak.
</P>
<P>
Unless the large number of people heading into their 50s and
60s start taking preventive action and learn to recognize warning
signs, strokes and disabilities caused by them are expected to
increase dramatically in the country.

<HEADLINE> UK New Car Sales Rise 1.7 pct in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- New car sales in Britain rose 1.7
percent year-on-year to 172,851 units last month, making it
possible for this year's sales to become the second highest ever
with 2.15 million units, according to figures released Friday by
the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).
</P>
<P>
Last month's figure followed a year-on-year sales fall of more
than six percent in April and lifted sales for the first five
months of this year to 967,103, seven percent higher compared with
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The SMMT said that although Britain's surprise interest rate
rise Thursday will stem some demand in the next few months, the
key determinant of this year's sales will be the introduction of
the "S" registration plate starting from August, which is likely
to account for about one quarter of the whole year's sales.

<HEADLINE> UK Bill Sets Terms for Release of N. Irish Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The British government published a
bill on Friday which sets terms on releasing Northern Irish
guerrilla prisoners in line with the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Faced with anger among mainstream pro-British Protestants over
the release promise, Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam promised
there would be no "general amnesty" to the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
"The gates of the Maze Prison will not suddenly be thrown
open," she said in a statement, calming the fears of the
Protestants who account for 60 percent of the local population in
the province.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace deal that was endorsed in a referendum last
month, several hundred prisoners held in Northern Ireland's Maze
prison, members either of Republican or pro-British Loyalist
groups, could be released in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
But the new Northern Ireland (Sentences) Bill can bar early
release of prisoners of some guerrilla groups which are counted as
"terrorist organizations."
</P>
<P>
A "terrorist organization" is defined as one which "is
concerned in terrorism connected with the affairs of Northern
Ireland, or in promoting or encouraging it, and which has not
established or is not maintaining a complete and unequivocal
ceasefire".
</P>
<P>
Mowlam said the bill included "rigorous safeguards" which would
ensure that only prisoners who had genuinely given up violence
would be released.
</P>
<P>
An independent body will be set up to review the individual
applications from prisoners from organizations qualifying for the
release program.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, all those set free ahead of time will be out on
license and can be locked up again on the order of the government
if they are considered likely to breach the terms of their
release.

NEW YORK, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Automakers in the United States
are demanding that U.S. Congress renew the most favored nation
status to China as it is in the U.S. interest.
</P>
<P>
In a statement received here Friday, President of the American

"In the year since the last MFN debate, economic and strategic
crises throughout Asia have created new and serious instability in
the region. Denying MFN to China today would make solutions to
these challenges more difficult to achieve," the President said.
</P>
<P>
"Changing course would serve no U.S. interest," he added.
</P>
<P>
"There has never been a more important time for the U.S. to
continue to strengthen its trading relationship with the world's
most populous country. Congress should act swiftly and
unequivocally to reaffirm longstanding U.S. policy of normal
trade ties with China," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Nunavut Faces a Tough Road Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada's new territory of Nunavut,
which is to come into being next April, will face a series of
social and economic problems and a tough task ahead.
</P>
<P>
The territory, hived off from the northern Northwest Territory,
will cover one quarter of Canada's land mass, and a population of
25,000.
</P>
<P>
Yet, it is destined to have the most dire social and economic
conditions in the country, all compounded by the region's harsh
climate and isolated communities, according to the Globe and Mail
newspaper Friday.
</P>
<P>
At present, one third of its residents survive on welfare, and
rates of suicide, teen-age pregnancy and substance abuse soar
above the national averages.
</P>
<P>
Per-capita income is estimated at about 7,600 U.S. dollars, and
the living costs there is over 160 percent higher than the
national average.
</P>
<P>
Canada's federal government is widely said to be ready to
provide about 400 million U.S. dollars a year for the new
jurisdiction. But that is considered to be only what is needed to
maintain the status quo.
</P>
<P>
With a much younger population and almost no industries, the
new Inuit government will be hard pressed to provide adequate
jobs, housing and medical services.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the bleak future ahead, Inuit leaders and federal
officials suggest that a government closer to the people in
Nunavut will stand a better chance of solving the problems there.
</P>
<P>
"The federal and territorial governments have been a real part
of the problem," Jose Kusugak, head of an organization
representing Inuit living in the new territory, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"When you have a totally different race of people running your
lives, it can create a terrible feeling of uselessness," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Vows to Keep Offshore Sector Thriving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has vowed to safeguard its
offshore sector in negotiations with the European Union (EU) on
its membership.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou said here Friday
the sector is so important for Cyprus that the government puts it
on the top of the priority list of issues to be negotiated with
the EU.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at the one-day conference on the prospect of
country's offshore sector, or the service industry for foreign
companies in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus started accession negotiations with the EU last
March. And it is widely expected that the EU will ask Cyprus to
adjust the island's preferential policies to foreign companies so
as to meet the organization's criteria.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, lack of natural resources, started its offshore sector
in 1975, which is now at a developed stage featured by
well-educated labor force, good infrastructure and various
supporting systems.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou singled out the preferential tax regime -- as low
as 4 percent -- and the agreements of avoiding double-taxation
with a number of countries as key factors contributing to the
success of the offshore sector.
</P>
<P>
The sector also benefits the country's employment, transfer of
know-how and tourism, Christodoulou pointed out.
</P>
<P>
About 1,100 offshore enterprises currently have offices on the
island, employing 2,100 Cypriots, or about 1.5 percent of the
island's labour force, and 3,000 expatriates.
</P>
<P>
The sector brought the country some 360 million U.S. dollars in
foreign exchange in 1997, about 4.5 percent of the country's Gross
National Product.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the concern expressed regarding the sector's
future after Cyprus' EU accession, Christodolou told the
conference that the maintenance of the existing offshore regime
"will be a top priority in the contest of the accession
negotiations."

<HEADLINE> UK Planning to Evacuate its Citizens from Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The British Foreign Office announced
here Friday afternoon that it was planning an airlift to evacuate
its citizens from Eritrea while the border clashes between Eritrea
and Ethiopia continued worsening.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office said in a statement that it had chartered an
aircraft that would fly from Cairo and land in Asmara, capital of
Eritrea at around 1830 GMT Friday to pick up some 120 British
citizens still in Eritrea and fly them to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The British government made the latest decision of evacuation
following a serious escalation in border clashes between Eritrea
and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Early Friday, the Foreign Office made an urgent appeal for
British citizens in Eritrea to leave the conflict-stricken country
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the current European Union president, Thursday voiced
grave concern over the border clashes and urged both sides to
resolve their dispute by peaceful means.

<HEADLINE> Oil Output Cuts Deal Fails to Impress London Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The London oil market Friday was
little impressed by a surprise agreement among three major world
oil exporters to cut their crude output by 450,000 barrels per day
(bpd) from the over-supplied world markets.
</P>
<P>
World benchmark Brent blend crude oil was not much inspired by
the deal and was trading only 21 cents higher at 14.64 US dollars
per barrel by late afternoon, which is still 5 dollars below last
year's prices.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the new deal between Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela and Mexico was reached in Amsterdam after secret talks
and it followed the cuts of 1.5 million bpd agreed under a
landmark pact in March in the Saudi capital Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the new cuts were still not enough to bring
oil prices back to a decent level of 16-18 dollars a barrel, and
many believe around a million barrels a day needs to be cut from
drenched Western markets.
</P>
<P>
"Now the hard work begins. It's a step in the right direction
but they now need to get cooperation from the other producers,"
said one dealer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there is deep scepticism about promised oil output
cuts among oil traders as they are very familiar with broken
promises.
</P>
<P>
They estimate that less than a million of the promised Riyadh
cuts of 1.5 million were actually made and see the additional
Amsterdam reductions merely as a patch-up for the original
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"If the original cutbacks had taken place then prices would
gradually be recovering by now," said another dealer.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan strongly appeals to Eritrea and Ethiopia to immediately cease
hostilities, his spokesman said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Annan calls for giving a chance to diplomacy to bridge
remaining differences and to avoid any further escalation in
tensions between the two African neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General has been in touch with the leaders of
the two countries and with other leaders and will continue to do
everything he can to help the parties find a peaceful solution to
the dispute," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief has been encouraged by an Ethiopian statement
provisionally accepting the proposals put forward by American and
Rwandan mediators, and by an Eritrean statement today that these
proposals are "not controversial" to Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to him that there is much common ground between the
two sides to the dispute," according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The border dispute over an area of 400 square kilometers turned
violent on May 6 and an armed conflict has erupted recently.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Statement on Greco-Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has welcomed as "a positive
event" a NATO statement Thursday that Greece and Turkey intend to
implement earlier agreements recognizing each other's sovereignty
and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his press briefing Friday, Government Spokesman
Christos Stylianides said "any move to ease tensions in the Aegean
creates a positive climate for developments in Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana issued a statement
Thursday in Brussels that Greece and Turkey intend to implement
fully the agreements reached in 1988 under which they respect the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of each other and their
rights to use the high seas and international air space of the
Aegean.
</P>
<P>
Solana said the statement is "a manifestation of the political
will of the two governments to continue to respect these
principles and to carry out in good faith the range of confidence
building measures that have been agreed."
</P>
<P>
Stylianides, however, said that the Cyprus question is not
linked to this agreement.
</P>
<P>
Greece, an ally of Cyprus, and Turkey have been at odds on a
number of issues, especially the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> UNDP: Ocean Must Remain At top of Global Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a message on World Environmental Day, June 5, Speth said
managing ocean responsibly today will determine whether they
remain a vital and renewable resources for everyone in the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Speth said rapid coastal population growth and the resulting
increase in waste disposal, along with intensive agricultural
and industrial pollution on or near shorelines, have damaged
reefs and other vital marine habitats.
</P>
<P>
The Administrator said more than two-thirds of the world's
people live in coastal areas, and more than half the world's
coastal wetlands have been destroyed by urban development,
and the loss of these wetlands may be costing coastal fishing
communities as much as 4.7 million tons of fish a year.
</P>
<P>
He said these pressures, combined with the vast over-capacity
of international fishing fleets, have contributed to the
well-publicized collapse of major fisheries around the world.
Moreover, the erosion of ocean biodiversity is alarming. For the
people whose livelihoods depend on the oceans, these trends
could spell disaster, pushing thousands into poverty.
</P>
<P>
Speth said UNDP supports an expanding portfolio of projects
that build capacity in the areas of fisheries management,
mariculture, aquaculture and the sustainable use of coastal and
deep-water marine ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
The Administrator said all countries must redouble their
efforts to fulfill the obligations under the UN Convention on
the Law of the Sea and that marine resources are managed sustainably.
</P>
<P>
He stressed nations must learn to share the ocean's living
resources, or risk depriving future generations of the wealth
and beauty they have always brought to humanity.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Officials Reject Israel's Idea on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Senior Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat Friday said the scope of redeployment in the West Bank
proposed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is too small
to be accepted.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has reportedly proposed to combine the second and the
third phase of redeployment into one which totally accounts for 15
percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Insisting on both the second and third phase of troop pullback,
the Palestinians have accepted the U.S. proposal of 13 percent
withdrawal in the second phase, and interpreting the Netanyahu
proposal as leaving only 2 percent for the third phase.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) deputy head, and Ahmed Queria (Abu Ala), speaker
of Palestinian Legislative Council, reported Friday to PNA
President Yasser Arafat on their recent talks with U.S. peace
envoy Dennis Ross in London.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that they have also refused the 2 percent
withdrawal in the third phase of redeployment and said the
proposal "can not be considered."
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio Friday quoted Erekat as stressing that the United
States has made clear to the Palestinians that Washington stands
by the commitment made in the interim agreement that Israel will
carry out a third further pullback.
</P>
<P>
Under the Hebron agreement and other related documents reached
in January 1997, all three phases of the further redeployments
should be completed no later than mid-1998 but Israel will
unilaterally decide the scope of the redeployment.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Takes Measures against Asmara Air Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry
announced here Friday that Ethiopia has taken limited measures
against Asmara air force base in self defense in response to "an
air attack on Mekelle."
</P>
<P>
In a press release distributed here, the minstry said, "In
further escalation of the war of aggression against Ethiopia and
at a time when Ethiopia has accepted fully the proposal submitted
by the facilitators on the crisis between Ethiopia and Eritrea,
instead of showing readiness for peace, the authorities in
Eritrea have today carried out an air attack on Mekelle, wounding
5 persons."
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the air attack on Mekelle, capital city of
Ethiopia's Tigray region, is "a further escalation of the war of
aggression."
</P>
<P>
"Accordingly, and in response to this Eritrean aggression,
Ethiopia has in self defense taken limited measures against
Asmara air force base," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry did not reveal details on the air attack on
Asmara air force base, but said that "further details concerning
this matter will be made public as and when they are available."
</P>
<P>
The air attack took place after diplomats from the United
States and Rwanda just ended their mediations between Ethiopia
and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Susan Rice, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, and
Patrick Mazimhaka, a minister in the Rwandan president's office,
had talks in Asmara with Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki.
Before arriving in Asmara, they held talks in Addis Ababa with
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and Ethiopia announced the
fully acceptance of the proposal of the mediators on Thursday.
</P>

The diplomats of the U.S. and Rwanda had left Asmara for
Burkina Faso earlier Friday to report on the crisis to the annual

<HEADLINE> Greece to Try to Make More Specific Solana's Announcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos said Friday that Greece would do its utmost to make even
more specific the announcement by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) Secretary-General Javier Solana on the
confidence-building measures (CBMS) in the Aegean Sea region.
</P>
<P>
Solana announced in Brussels Thursday that both Greece and
Turkey had agreed to a series of CBMS which were based on two
memoranda of understanding reached by the two countries in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at press conference, Pangalos regarded Solana's
announcement as "quite general". He also admitted that the
announcement contained a number of new elements.
</P>
<P>
Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos also said that the
announcement voiced the "common political will" of Greece and Turkey
to implement the 1998 agreement, but certain arrangements required
further elaboration as a supplement or prerequisite for its
realization.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas described
the announcement as "a positive step" which however did not go far
enough.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it must be implemented in practice, with
respect for the national integrity and independence of each country.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have been at odds over decades for their
differences in the territorial waters, air space limits, the
delimitation of continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1988 agreements signed by the then foreign
ministers of Greece's Karolos Papoulias and Turkey's Mesut Yilmaz,
the two neighboring countries agreed to respect each other's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, and their rights to use the
high seas and international air space of the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
The agreements also urged both countries to halt military
exercises in the Aegean during the months of July and August - the
high season for tourism.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey hold regular military exercises in the Aegean,
where they have come close to war in 1996 due to Turkey's claims
to the Greek uninhabited islands.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has since Wednesday began a sea and air exercise in the
Aegean. 30 Turkish war planes reportedly violated flight regulations
in the Athens Flight Information Region and were intercepted by 20
Greek jet fighters.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Negotiated Solution to Kosovo Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan reiterates his call for a negotiated settlement to the
dispute over Kosovo, his spokesman told reporters here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General is deeply disturbed by the latest
reports of an intensifying campaign against the unarmed, civilian
population in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"He reiterates in the strongest possible terms his condemnation
of the atrocities committed by Serbian military and para-military
forces," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said Annan "is encouraged" by North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's resolve to prevent a further escalation of the
fighting in Kosovo, a Serbian province, most of whose 1.8 million
population are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
A conflict between Serbian police and a group of armed ethnic
Albanians since February has escalated recently, forcing ethnic
Albanians to flee into Albania.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that
between 8,000 and 10,000 refugees are now in Albania.
</P>
<P>
The influx of the refugees from Kosovo has stretched to the
limits of the food, accommodation and transportation resources in
the Tropoya area, the point of entry into Albania, according to
UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Kosovo could top NATO agenda when NATO defense
ministers meet next week in Brussels, with all options including
the military involvement expected to be considered, NATO sources
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urged to Withhold Loans to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A key U.S. House member has
urged President Bill Clinton to withhold further International
Monetary Fund (IMF) loans to Russia, accusing Moscow of having
close ties with Iran and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Representative Benjamin Gilman, who chairs
the House International Relations Committee, in a letter to
Clinton dated May 28 but released Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. president, I strongly urge the United States withhold its
support for any additional IMF loans to the government of the
Russian Federation until the concerns I have outlined are
addressed," said Gilman in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Gilman noted that additional IMF lending should be held back
because "I and other members of Congress have been increasingly
disappointed by the conduct of Russian foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
"Russian foreign policy apparently seeks to challenge American
leadership around the world and dissipate America's ability to
organize international cooperation to address pressing problems,"
Gilman said.
</P>
<P>
"This unconstructive approach to our bilateral relationship
comes at a time when the United States must lead the charge on
tremendously serious problems involving proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction and the stabilization and prevention of
conflicts around the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
Later this month , the IMF will provide Russia a loan of 670
million U.S. dollar tranche of an existing 9.2 billion U.S.
dollars. Washington said earlier this week that it would support
additional IMF lending to Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Narcotic Crops Can Be Eliminated in Decade: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Narcotic crops can be
eliminated in a decade, said Pino Arlacchi,
under-secretary-general for the United Nations Office of Drug
Control and Crime Prevention, Friday.
</P>
<P>
Arlacchi was speaking at a press conference Friday on the eve
of the General Assembly Special Session on the world drug problem
on 8 to 10 June.
</P>
<P>
Giving an overview of the Special Session, he said that there
is unanimous consensus on the need to have a truly global strategy
to fight drugs.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, he said, the issue of demand reduction has
been included on the agenda at the same level as other components
of narcotics control. He said the problem of drug includes supply
and demand.
</P>
<P>
The other important aspect in tackling the global drug problem
is a strategy for the elimination or drastic reduction of narcotic
crops such as cannabis, opium and coca through alternative
development, said Arlacchi.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined the need to raise the issue of bank secrecy
which facilitates money laundering by drug traffickers. According
to him, bank secrecy and the proliferation of tax havens are "an
impediment to criminal investigation worldwide."
</P>
<P>
World leaders who will gather in New York next week to discuss
the world drug problem are expected to come up with a global
strategy to fight drugs and to adopt a political declaration on
this issue.

<P>
ATHENS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Greece has completed a report on the
cause of a Ukrainian passenger plane which crashed in northern
Greece in December last year.
</P>
<P>
Greek Transport and Communications Minister Tassos Mandelis
said Friday that the report, which will also be handed to the

to the Greek supreme investigative council for air accidents, but
he did not reveal the findings of the report, the semi-official
Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said that the report attributed
responsibility for the crash to a combination of technical factors
and human error.
</P>
<P>
On December 17, 1997, the Russian-made Yakovlev-42 plane
crashed into the mountains near Thessaloniki, northern Greece,
killing all 72 people on board.
</P>
<P>
To force Ukrainian Airline to pay relatives of a victim killed

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, Eritrea Exchange Accusations over Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia and Eritrea, which
have been involved in a border dispute, Friday exchanged
accusations of being bombed by the other shortly after an urgent
call by African countries for restraint.
</P>
<P>
A press release faxed here by the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry
claimed that Eritrea carried out an air attack earlier Friday on
Mekelle in northern Ethiopia, wounding five civilians.
</P>
<P>
"While this is, as already indicated, a further escalation of
the war of aggression, it should come as no surprise because by
now it should be clear that the irrationality in Asmara has no
limits," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
It said that Ethiopia has in self defense taken limited
measures against Asmara air force base.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the Foreign Ministry of Eritrea
confirmed the air bombing by Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
It said two Ethiopian fighter planes bombed the southern
outskirts of Asmara, capital of Eritrea, at 14:00 local time.
</P>
<P>
Half an hour later, another two Ethiopian fighter planes
dropped more bombs in the same locality, it added.
</P>
<P>
The damage to "property or persons" by the attack, which
Eritrea claimed is in line with Ethiopia's "persistent attempts
to escalate the current border dispute", is not immediately
available, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The intensifying situation between the two countries has
aroused grave concern from African countries while leaders of
member states of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) are to
gather here to plan the future of the continent.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers from the central organ of the OAU
Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution, at
an urgent session Thursday night, urged both parties to exercise
restraint so as to enable a peaceful settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, who are here to attend the on-going 68th
ordinary session of the OAU Council of Ministers, also urged the
two parties to accept a solution that comes through peaceful
means, including adjudication, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
After about four hours of deliberation, the ministers decided
to remain actively seized of the issue.
</P>
<P>
An OAU source told Xinhua that the ministers would hold
another urgent meeting Friday night to discuss the high tension
triggered off by the latest developments.
</P>
<P>
The three-day council of ministers session, to be closed
Saturday, is to make preparations for the coming OAU summit
starting next Monday.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful solution to the crisis between Ethiopia and Eritrea
is expected to come out at the summit.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Computer-Literated Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
Friday that all the American students should be computer-literate
before they reach high school and all children should share in
high-tech opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"All students should feel as comfortable with a keyboard as a
chalkboard, as comfortable with a laptop as a textbook," the
president told 2,400 graduates at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
"It is critical to insuring that they all have opportunity in
the world of the 21st century," said Clinton who was campaigning
for his goal of wiring all classrooms to the Internet by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't let a child graduate from middle school anymore
without knowing how to use new technologies to learn," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
Ten states already have such a requirement for high school
graduation, but Clinton said the same standard should be applied
for younger children.
</P>
<P>
The president proposed to provide each middle school with
20,000 U.S. dollar federal assistance over three years to promote
high-tech literacy. That means the federal government will budget
180 million dollars for the program between fiscal 2000 and fiscal
2002.
</P>
<P>
Clinton targeted that more than half of the nation's classrooms
will be linked with the Internet within a year. And as a
promotion, he urged telecommunications companies to continue
providing favorable services to poor schools, libraries and rural
health centers.
</P>
<P>
Clinton acknowledged that there is a gap between rich and poor
children in technology opportunities in the United States. But he
said every child in America deserves a chance to participate in
the information revolution.
</P>
<P>
He said affluent schools are nearly three times as likely as
poorer schools to have Internet access in the classroom and white
students are more than twice as likely as blacks to have computers
in their homes.
</P>
<P>
"Unequal education hardens into unequal prospects," Clinton
said, urging private companies to invest in a school, embrace a
community in need, and endow an eager young mind with opportunity.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Minister Held Hostage by Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi
was held hostage for three and half hours in the ministry's
office in Abuja Friday, by angry staff who demanded improved
welfare.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said the demonstrating staff locked the
gates of the ministry at about 12:00 in the noon, preventing
anyone from going out.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of State in the ministry, Buhari Bala and the
Minister of State for Health, Iyorwuese Hagher, were also caught
in the web.
</P>
<P>
It was only at about 3:20 p.m. that the gates were opened at
the arrival of a detachment of policemen, when the minister of
state for health was seen left in his car.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the workers who identified himself as Henry
said they resorted to the action after entreaties to the minister
to review workers' welfare failed to yield results.
</P>
<P>
The workers complained that top officials of the ministry are
insensitive to the suffering of junior staff.
</P>
<P>
They alleged that they were not paid their relocation
allowance when the ministry was relocated from Lagos to Abuja.
They also complained that all the staff buses had broken down.
</P>
<P>
The allegations were, however, denied by Jubrin Chinade, the
ministry's Perminent Secretary, when he spoke to journalists
after the gates were opened.
</P>
<P>
Chinade insisted that the ministry is giving top priority to
the welfare of its staff. In fact, he said, the Foreign Ministry
provides better welfare to its workers than any other ministries.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, the ministry has over 1,300 houses for
its staff and "no other ministry has that much."
</P>
<P>
"The ministry of Foreign Affairs is the only ministry where
drivers have two bedroom flat for accommodation. We have the
largest fleet of vehicles that convey staffers to and from work,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
On the relocation allowance, he said, the package was for
ministries that moved to Abuja in 1996, while the foreign
ministry, which moved to Abuja in 1990, was not effected by the
package.

China's Zhejiang Province, today called for more efforts to
protect the local environment.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the fifth provincial conference on environmental
protection, which closed today in this provincial capital, Lu
announced the target of halting the deterioration of Zhejiang's
environment by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
By that time, it is expected, industrial pollution will have
been brought under effective control, the water quality of major
rivers and lakes will have been improved, and the air quality in
major cities will be above Grade II in the state's environmental
standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang has a population of 44 million, but has limited land
and water resources.
</P>
<P>
Only by properly coordinating the development of the economy,
the society and the environment can the province realize rapid and
healthy economic growth, Lu noted.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, he said, Zhejiang will carry out
three major environmental projects, focusing on purifying water,
cleaning air and planting trees, respectively, to achieve a benign
ecological circle.

<HEADLINE> S. African Teachers Reject Govt's Olive Branch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The South Africa government on
Friday proposed to withdraw its controversial retrenchment plans in a
bid to avert a massive strike action by teachers.
</P>
<P>
However, two of the three major unions who gave notice of their
intended protest action this week because of the retrenchment policies
said they would go ahead unless discussions with the state on Monday
produced something more concrete.
</P>
<P>
The unions were briefed Friday on the Education Department's
tentative proposals, including the possible withdrawal of the
right-sizing plans published by the department in April, should the
unions suggest workable alternatives.
</P>
<P>
The department also offered to extend contracts of temporary
teachers for six months until December, and to consider an average
pupil/teacher ratio of 34:1.
</P>
<P>
The National Professional Teachers Organization (Naptosa),
representing 66,000 members, on Friday officially gave notice of their
intended strike next Friday, saying the tentative proposals by the
state could at this stage not be accepted.
</P>
<P>
The Suid-Afrikaanse Onderwysersunie (SAOU), who gave notice
Thursday that its 34,000 mainly Afrikaans speaking teachers would
go on strike in two weeks' time, said while slight progress was
made, it was still not satisfying.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging the ministry's attempt to defuse the explosive
situation, the unions said they were continuing with the planning of
the protests.
</P>
<P>
They said they remained open to negotiations and urged the ministry
to solve the fundamental problem of the underfunding of education.
</P>
<P>
The South African Democratic Teachers' Union (Sadtu),
representing 170,000 teachers, last week indicated it would start
protest Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The three unions together represent more than 77 percent of the
country's 350,000 teachers.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Suffers from Minor Illness, his </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei only feels unwell and there is no cause for concern, his
office announced Saturday in a statement carried by state-run
Tehran radio.
</P>
<P>
Head of Khamenei's office Mohammad Golpaygani said in the
statement that Khamenei is only facing "minor problems."
</P>
<P>
The statement confirmed that Khamenei has been ill since
Thursday when he made an unusual short speech in a low tune to
mark the ninth anniversary of the demise of the late Iranian
supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini. However, it revealed no details
about Khamenei's illness.
</P>
<P>
The health condition of the Iranian supreme leader has raised
concerns at home and abroad, the Iranian Tehran Times daily
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told the daily on Friday that people from
across the country and even abroad have been calling the leader's
office these days, inquiring about Khamenei's health condition.
</P>
<P>
The calls were sparked by the unusually short speech of less
than 15 minutes made by Khamenei Thursday at the ceremony marking
the anniversary of Khomeini's death.
</P>
<P>
"My friends and doctors would not allow me to talk longer than
this," Khamenei told his guests at Khomeini's mausoleum.
</P>
<P>
On May 30, he showed the sign of an unusual health condition
when he made a speech in a low and uneasy tone during a meeting
with the members of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei, 59, succeeded the most powerful position in Iran
hours after Khomeini's death on June 4, 1989. He is believed to be
one of the best orators and sermonizers in the country.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Ban Smoking in Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Smokers across South Africa will
soon be hounded out of many public places because a tough clamp-down
on smoking in shops and banks will be imposed, Saturday Star paper
reported.
</P>
<P>
The controls, in terms of amendments to South Africa's tobacco
laws, are due to be tabled in parliament shortly.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco companies are considering whether to challenge the new law
in the Constitutional Court, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The draconian measures against smoking in public are in addition to
the proposed ban on tobacco advertisements and sports sponsorship by
tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
The new law will enable local authorities to ban smoking in public
places and to designate areas where smoking is allowed, a health
spokesman of the Gauteng province was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gauteng, the economic powerhouse of South Africa, is gearing itself
for the anti-smoking move, with regulations in the pipeline and ready
to be implemented when the new law is promulgated, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Public places are defined as gyms, banks, hotels, libraries, post
offices, schools, creches, shopping malls, retail stores, theaters,
cinemas and stadiums.
</P>
<P>
The amendments will also see a ban on smoking in municipal
buildings and on public transport.
</P>
<P>
Recent surveys show that one in three adult South Africans
smoked, and the habit is growing among teenagers, at whom much of the
tobacco advertising was aimed.
</P>
<P>
Surveys also show that most South Africans support the state's
proposal to ban smoking in public and regulate tobacco advertisement.

<P>
BANGKOK, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda has denied press reports that his country would
print more money to deal with the money crunch in the country.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said earlier that Tarrin, during his recent visit
to Japan, pledged to print more banknotes.
</P>
<P>
However, he was quoted Saturday by the newspaper Bangkok Post
as saying some people may have misinterpreted remarks he had made
in Japan.
</P>
<P>
He said that while in Japan he was only talking about the
extension of the monetary base through the restructuring of the
credit system or injection by the Bank of Thailand of liquidity
into productive sectors.
</P>
<P>
"This was not new. It was included in Thailand's fourth letter
of intent submitted to the IMF," Tarrin said.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible for us to allow a policy of printing
banknotes. We fear inflation and lack of fiscal and monetary
discipline," he said.
</P>
<P>
If Thailand printed more bills and injected them into the
system, that would mean that the country really lacked fiscal and
monetary discipline and this would affect the country's
reliability, Tarrin noted.
</P>
<P>
Some international organizations have urged Thailand to
increase the money supply in the market to stimulate the economy,
according to Finance Ministry officials.

WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Saturday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The House voted, 216 to 204, for a budget plan to cut taxes
and spending far more deeply than last year's bipartisan
balanced-budget deal, putting Republicans on a collision course
with White House over the size and role of the Federal Government.
</P>
<P>
-- Attorney General Janet Reno said that doctors who used
Oregon's assisted-suicide law to prescribe lethal drugs to
terminally ill patients would not be prosecuted. The decision
signaled that other states could enact similar laws without
interference from the Federal Government.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The American consumer's insatiable appetite for homes, cars
and even take-out food helped hold the unemployment rate to 4.3
percent in May, illustrating that the effects of the Asian
economic crisis are being offset by cheap credit and real wage
gains.
</P>
<P>
-- Air traffic controller errors have increased 20 percent so
far this year, with the most troublesome trends involving
communications and memory lapses that can compromise air safety.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kuanda's Political Withdrawal Widely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian President Kenneth
Kaunda's announcement to quit party politics has been welcomed by
the government and opposition parties but evoked mixed feelings
in his opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP).
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held in Lusaka Thursday, Kaunda announced
that he was strongly considering the possibility of detaching
himself from party politics and will not offer himself for
re-election at UNIP's forthcoming extraordinary congress which he
recommanded to hold later this year.
</P>
<P>
The 74-year old former president said he made the decision to
help the countries opposition parties become stronger and making
contribution to the nation "on a wider scope".
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made three days after Kuanda, who had
been detained for over five months and charged with misprison of
treason for allegedly concealing knowledge of last October's
foiled military coup, was released by the Lusaka High Court since
the state entered a nolle prosequi against him.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda's announcement to quit party politics was widely
welcomed by the Zambian government and the country's other
opposition parties and organizations including Zambia Democratic
Congress (ZDC), Grassroots Welfare Party, Zambia Democratic Party
and Zambia independent monitoring team.
</P>
<P>
Legal Affairs Minister Vincent Malambo said at a news briefing
here Thursday that the move taken by Kuanda to consider stepping
down from politics is welcome and it is going to earn him the
respect that he deserves.
</P>
<P>
While Dean Mung'omba,the Zambia Democratic Congress president
who has been arrested and charged with treason in connection with
last year's military coup, also said Thursday that he welcomed
Kaunda's decision to resign form politics while stressing
Kaunda's experience in politics is needed by all political
parties on order to survive.
</P>
<P>
Besides the political forces, Times of Zambia, the country's
biggest daily paper, also appreciated Kaunda's decision to resign
and said that he has played his part and in a great way too, but
"every game has to be played within certain limits of time."
</P>
<P>
In a editorial published Saturday, the paper also pointed out
that if Kuanda, who led Zambia to independence in 1964 from
Britain and ruled the country for 27 years, had resigned in 1991
after he was defeated by President Frederick Chiluba in the
year's general election, he could have been one of the most
outstanding statesmen Africa has ever produced.
</P>
<P>
However, Kaunda's decision to quit politics and the country's
former ruling UNIP which he founded, has evoked mixed feelings in
the country's largest opposition party.
</P>
<P>
The party leaders and cadres were shocked and tried to digest
the announcement by Kaunda's intention to resign.
</P>
<P>
Some of them in the party, which has been bogged down in a
long-time inter-fighting, said that the Kaunda's exit form UNIP
leadership will spell doom for the party while others said that
Kaunda has betrayed them.
</P>
<P>
Those who don't want Kuanda to step down also said that it will
be difficult for UNIP to find somebody universally acceptable to
take over the leadship.

<P>
MANILA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) on
Saturday fired all 29 officers of the Airline Pilots Association
of the Philippines (ALPAP) which staged what the authorities
called an illegal strike late Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The airlines declared all the 29 officers of the 620-member PAL
pilots union, including its president, as having lost their
employment status, effective Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The company also gave the other striking union members until
noon Sunday to report back for work, or else face the same fate.
</P>
<P>
Members of the ALPAP went on strike late Friday afternoon to
protest the ordered retirement of a pilot last year, stranding
thousands of passengers at the Manila international and all other
domestic airports in the country.
</P>
<P>
The strike openly defied two orders of the Labor Department to
maintain the status quo and was labeled as "illegal" by Labor
Secretary Cresenciano Trajano Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the labor code, any strike undertaken without the
permission of the labor authorities is illegal and the union
officers and members participating in the strike are deemed to
have lost their jobs for their act.
</P>
<P>
ALPAP members had been threatening to go on strike against
PAL's alleged unfair labor practices and union busting.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Labor Department took over the labor dispute at
PAL and issued two orders mandating the maintenance of the status
quo at the airlines.

<HEADLINE> Congress Censures BJP-Led Gov't for Nuke Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Senior Congress leader K.
Karunakaran Saturday charged the BJP-led government with
sacrificing national interests for the sake of its narrow
political interests in its nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Meeting reporters at the press club in Thiruvananthapuram,
capital of Kerala State in far southwestern India, he said the
government's decision to go nuclear and subsequent handling of its
fallout have pushed the country to a dangerous phase rather than
protecting any national interests.
</P>
<P>
"Not for a single day or even over a single issue the
government has been able to create the impression that it is
working on the principle of collective responsibility," he
charged. "Things have come to such a pass that even the ruling
coalition partners have begun to stage walkouts in protest against
the government's decisions."
</P>
<P>
The government has not been able to convince the people of the
reasons for conducting the nuclear tests at this juncture, he
further said. "India had demonstrated before the world its nuclear
capability as back as 1974. One is at a loss to know what security
reasons compelled the government to go nuclear at this juncture."
</P>
<P>
He also accused the government of not having taken the
opposition into confidence before taking such a crucial decision
fraught with serious consequences. "The BJP leaders are living in
a fool's paradise if they thought that the Congress could be
scared by the nuclear bomb," he added.

He reiterated Pakistan's willingness to enter into dialogue
with India but emphasized that there is need for the international
community's engagement to ensure the success of such talks.
</P>
<P>
"As experience shows that when a bilateral dialogue (between
Pakistan and India) is held it is practically reduced to the
dialogue of the death," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The situation has been exacerbated as a result of a
nuclearized South Asia, so the need is felt ever more for the
dialogue which takes us somewhere which brings us the solution of
the root-cause -- the Kashmir issue," he said.

<P>
HAIKOU, June 6 (Xinhua) -- South China's island province of
Hainan has been successful in developing its marine economy.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Hainan's marine economy was worth
more than 10 billion yuan last year, a surge of 35 percent from
1996.
</P>
<P>
The growth momentum has continued this year.
</P>
<P>
The marine-based tourism industry of Hainan, which is also
China's largest special economic zone, attracted over five million
domestic and overseas tourists last year, with earnings rocketing
43 percent on a year-by-year basis to 4.73 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Other industries based in offshore waters such as marine
transportation, the raising of aquatic products, salt and undersea
mining have also experienced considerable growth in recent years.

Currently, more than 1,000 enterprises specialize in marine
industries, with total assets worth 13.4 billion yuan and a
combined payroll of 60,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has an area of more than two million sq km of offshore
waters, about two-thirds of China's total. The waters are rich in
natural resources, including 40 billion tons of oil, 15 trillion
cubic meters of natural gas and 43 million tons of

NEW DELHI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee said Saturday that his country would not succumb to any
pressure to give up its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
"We will not come under any pressure from the nuclear powers,"
Vajpayee said when inaugurating a training camp for parliament
members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Haryana State near
the country's capital.

Foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council, in a joint communique issued in Geneva on June

The ministers from Britain, China, France, Russia and the United
States "expressed their deep concern about the danger to peace and
stability in the region and pledged to cooperate closely in urgent
efforts to prevent a nuclear and missile arms race in the
subcontinent."
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee in his speech accused the five countries of trying to
internationalize the Kashmir issue, the major dispute between
India and Pakistan, and firmly ruled out any third party mediation
regarding the issue.
</P>

"Those who wanted to mediate on the Kashmir issue... we thank

could resolve the issue bilaterally.

<P>
PARIS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- UEFA president Lennart Johansson
promised on Saturday that he will appoint a general secretary from
outside Europe if he is elected Monday president of FIFA, the
world soccer ruling body.
</P>
<P>
Johansson, locked in a presidency campaign with currently FIFA
general secretary Sepp Blatter, made the remarks when he met
supporters and reporters at a reception to mark Sweden's national
day.
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old Swede, who has been subject to criticism in
some quarters for being too Euro-centric, made the promise in a
bid to boost his votes from outside Europe in Monday's Congress
vote on a successor to outgoing president Joao Havelange.
</P>
<P>
"Some people in Asia have concerns whether Lennart Johansson is
too European-centred, simply because he is the president of UEFA,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"So his general secretary should come from Africa, Asia,
CONCACAF or CONMEBOL -- the Confederations outside Europe."
</P>
<P>
It have been rumoured that if Johansson does beat Blatter in
Monday's vote at the FIFA Congress, Peter Velappan of Malaysia,
current general secretary of the Asian Football Confederation
(AFC), would get the job.

called the Blues, after they scored a mediocre 1-0 win over

<P>
In an interview with the Agence France-Presse, Jacquet said

Asked whether the French team can win the World Cup, the coach

"I am confident, calm. I am waiting for South Africa. We should

Jacquet denied that the Blues showed a "double face" when they
played the Finns, just as they did with Belgians when they also
scored 1-0 in second half.
</P>
<P>
"All teams rely on a harsh organization. Control a game and
then impose on it needs time. Before the pause, we were often in
difficulty, especially when controlling the air ball. We later saw
a team full of the will to play and win great," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his expectation of the opening match with South

<HEADLINE> Karl Malone Displays Badly in NBA Finals Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Karl Malone, NBA's Most Valuable
Player last season, had a bad run for the second straight time in
the NBA Finals, and this time, he wasn't alone.
</P>
<P>
"I got away with it in the first game, but today we didn't get
away with it," he said after the Bulls beat the Jazz 93-88 to tie
the best of seven series 1-all last night.
</P>
<P>
The Jazz looked not like themselves at all in the final
quarter, blew a lead entering the period for the first time in 60
games. And now the home-court advantage has reverted to Chicago in
the next three games.
</P>
<P>
Malone again had a low score, finishing with 16 points on
5-for-16 shooting. Though he grabbed 12 rebounds, yet Dennis
Rodman surpassed him in this field by landing nine in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
"We will not win this series if I don't play better," Malone
said. "But I think the worst thing in the world for me to do now
is try to put the whole weight of the team on my shoulders."
</P>
<P>
Malone was not the only member of the team who had a poor
showing under the pressure last night. The whole team almost
collapsed in the fourth quarter, failing to score anything during
six attacks, while the Bulls converted Utah's 20 turnovers into 30
points during the game.
</P>
<P>
"We just tried to take point guards Howard Eisley and John
Stockton out of the flow," Chicago coach Phil Jackson said of the
Bulls' fourth-quarter strategy. "We thought we could disrupt their
offense."
</P>
<P>
That worked pretty well. The Jazz only got one point in their
first 10 possessions for the fourth quarter. After teaming for 18
points and 13 assists in the first three quarters, Eisley and
Stockton had just one assist and no point between them in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
"We definitely have the confidence to come back," Antoine Carr
said. "We have to compete better than we did tonight."
</P>
<P>
Game 3 will start Sunday in Chicago.

NANNING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A 14-year-old South China tiger has
given birth to three cubs after undergoing a Caesarian operation.
</P>
<P>
The tiger, named Xionghuan, was reared in the Xiongsen Bear and

<P>
The three cubs first suffered from hypoxia and coma, and the
veterinarians hurriedly took emergency measures, such as
oxygen therapy, massotherapy and artificial respiration.

<HEADLINE> French Customs Seize Huge Quantity of Fake World Cup Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- French customs officials have seized
120,000 footballs, T-shirts, CD-Roms and other products which
violate the copyrights of the logos for World Cup football finals.
</P>
<P>
Most of these products came from Asia and were aimed at
European markets, said officials, who are destroying the fake
products.
</P>
<P>
The organizers of the World Cup have signed an exclusive
contract with some producers who are entitled to using the logo
"France 98" and the logos.
</P>
<P>
However, officials estimate that at least from 5 to 6 percent
of the products on the World Cup now circulating around the world
are fakes.
</P>
<P>
The fake products could be sold for some 8 billion francs (1.3
billion U.S. dollars), they said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, customs officials seized 400 footballs from
Pakistan, which failed to have the flag of Japan on them due to
mistake of their producers.
</P>
<P>
Their original price was about 2 francs, but they can be sold
for 100 francs (16.7 U.S. dollars) in France.

PARIS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
said on Saturday that the World Cup football finals is not his
concern in the on-going crisis of Air France.
</P>
<P>
"What should worry us in fact, it is not that (World Cup), it
is the disruption of the readjustment of the enterprise," he said

</P>
<P>
The strike by pilots of Air France is threatening to disrupt
the organization of the World Cup, which will formally open on

</P>
<P>
The reason for the strike is that Air France plans to cut the

<HEADLINE> Container Congestion Cripples Operation in Chittagong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's principal seaport,
Chittagong, has been again threatened with imposition of surcharge
due to constant container congestion that crippled normal
operation of the port, press reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Container vessels now have to wait 7-8 days in the outer
anchorage for taking berth in the jetty and another 4-5 days for
loading and unloading at the jetty.
</P>
<P>
Foreign feeder operators have become annoyed with the present
rate of operation at the port.
</P>
<P>
The delay in the operation of container vessels is attributed
to the huge stockpile of containers in the sheds.
</P>
<P>
The holding capacity of the port is 10,5000 TEUs (tonnage
equivalent unit) of containers, but at present over 13,500 TEUs
are piled up in the container sheds for a long time, creating
accommodation problems for fresh arrivals, the reports observed.
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, the Chittagong Port Authority submitted a
proposal to the Shipping Ministry for imposition of penal rent on
containers remaining stockpiled in the sheds for more than 28
days, but no decision on the proposal was given yet.
</P>
<P>
The unusual delay of container vessels at the port has annoyed
foreign feeder operators because of increased operational cost.
</P>
<P>
The situation of the Chittagong Port, particularly the handling
of containers, has been aggravating day by day during the last two
months, the reports pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah-Israel Talks on Swap Agreement Stalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Exchange of Lebanese detainees held
in Israel and the remains of an Israeli soldier will not occur
before mid-June, the Lebanese Daily Star newspaper reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A meeting between Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and
Jean-Jacques Fresard, head of the International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC), to discuss the swap was canceled on Friday, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC has been mediating between the Lebanese resistance
force and Israel to reach a swap agreement since last September
when an Israeli commando botched a raid in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Twelve Israeli commandos were killed in the clash with Lebanese
guerrillas. The body of one of them was taken by the guerrillas.
Israel wants the return of the soldier's remains in exchange for
the release of Lebanese detainees.
</P>
<P>
"They (Israelis) said they would hand us 30 detainees but we
demanded more," Nasrallah said.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah, or Party of God, is seeking the release of 40 to
50 of its members jailed in Israel and the return of more than 40
remains, including that of Nasrallah's eldest son Hadi killed last
year.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in 1985 in south Lebanon to
allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese Muslim guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah is leading a war of attrition against the Israeli
occupation, which has resulted in heavy casualties of the Israeli
troops.

<P>
BONN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of Germany's worst
postwar railroad crash rose to 101 after rescuers found another
three bodies at the crash site near the northern German town of
Eschede, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The InterCity Express, the country's fastest train, derailed at
11:10 Wednesday morning near Eschede rail station and slammed into
a nearby road bridge, bringing hundreds of tons of concrete to
crash down onto the middle section of the train.
</P>
<P>
After three days of round-the-clock hard work, rescuers have
given up hope to find any more victims and handed over the crash
site to police investigators, who will look for possible clues
that would help to make clear how the tragedy has happened.
</P>
<P>
After initial investigations, officials said Friday that there
was an increasing belief that a broken wheel on the first coach of
the train could be the most likely cause for the derailment.
However, all other possibilities were also being investigated,
they said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Hails Three-Country Oil Cut Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has said a decision made
by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico to cut oil production would
positively affect the world oil market, Kuwait News Agency
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah said the new
output reduction agreement reached by the three countries came
after a closed-door meeting, and would have a very positive effect
on the oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico Thursday agreed during talks
held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to reduce their oil production
by 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) from July 1.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Saudi Arabia will cut the output by
225,000 bpd, Venezuela by 125,000 bpd and Mexico by 100,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti official expressed his country's support for any
measures that are aimed at boosting the world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
While responding to reports that Kuwait may join the efforts of
the three countries, Saud said that "any step in this regard will
only be decided after the meeting of the oil ministers of the Gulf
Cooperation Council due in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on June 16."
</P>
<P>
The council, a regional political and economic alliance, groups
six Arab countries, namely Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar,
Oman and the United Arab Emirates. Their economies are heavily
reliant on oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
The world oil prices have recently slumped to 12-14 U.S.
dollars a barrel mainly due to a low demand by Southeast Asian
countries caused by the financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Last March, some oil producing countries reached a deal to
slash output by 1.5 million bpd in a bid to shore up the
prices. But the move seems to have failed in attaining the goal.

LOS ANGELES, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Compaq Computer will release
two new consumer notebook computers next week amid signs of
slowing sales and declining prices of portable computers in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Both coming notebooks fall above the line of 1,500 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
While notebook sales continue to outpace desktop sales, they

<P>
Compaq is the number one vendor for notebooks priced between
1,500 and 2,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Now sub-1,500-dollar notebooks made up 26 percent of the retail

HARARE, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Department of National
Parks and Wild Life Management will get 70 million U.S.Dollars
from the World Bank to promote its rehabilitation and
conservation project for national parks, the Herald reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The project will be implemented with the auspices of the World
Bank, the International Development Association (IDA), the Global
Environment Facility and U.N. Development Program Assistance.

<HEADLINE> China Has Its First Private-Run Travel Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China has had its first private-run
travel service, based at Shaoguan, a city in south China's
Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Cai, a former manager working for a state-owned tourism
company in Shaoguan, poured 96,000 yuan (11,000 US dollars) to win
the right to run a local travel service at a recent bidding, and
he will continue to invest 600,000 yuan in the tour agency.
</P>
<P>
Cai's case ends the situation that travel services in China are
only run by the state.
</P>
<P>
"The appearance of the private-run travel service is natural
and necessary," said Wei Xiao'an, an official of the National
Tourism Administration, in an interview today, "China encourages
the establishment of more travel services with different
ownerships, which will make the country's tourism market more
active and mature."
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that among China's top 100 domestic and 100
international travel services, Guangdong has 42 and 33,
respectively. The province also has China's first foreign-funded
hotel.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Accuses Sudan of Harboring Mubarak's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's top security official has
said he believed Sudan was still sheltering three terrorists
charged with trying to kill President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa
in 1995, the Egyptian Gazette reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Habib el-Adli said Friday that Sudan's
failure to extradite the gunmen was blocking bilateral talks on
security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The Sudanese say the three terrorists are not in Sudan now and
that they don't know where they are," he was quoted by the
English-language daily newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We say these elements are present in Sudan and have relations
with Sudan. Things were going smoothly until Sudan refused to
extradite the terrorists... on the security level, the
negotiations stalled for that reason," he added.
</P>
<P>
El-Adli said he noticed "positive moves toward not supporting
terrorism against Egypt," during his talks here with Sudan's
Interior Minister Abdel-Raheem Mohamed Hussein in late April.
</P>
<P>
It was the first visit by Sudan's security chief to Cairo after
long months of sour ties between the two Afro-Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, along with other 30 Arab interior and justice
ministers initialed a pan Arab anti-terrorism pact.
</P>
<P>
"Sudan is not supposed to threaten Egypt's national security
because it is a brotherly nation on our borders. We urge the
Sudanese not to allow this to happen and we hope that it will not
happen," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Egypt are at odds over a border dispute and have
traded accusations of harboring militants and the oppositions, but
there are signs of a tentative thaw in relations in recent weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Greece will sign a
declaration next week to implement the confidence-building
measures they agreed in 1988, according to the Daily News
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted diplomatic sources here as saying that the
declaration will be signed by the representatives of the two
countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in
Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana announced on Thursday that
Turkey and Greece, both NATO members, have informed him of their
intentions to fully implement the confidence-building measures in
order to reduce tensions between the two rival states and avoid
dangerous accidents in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece signed the Memorandum of Understanding on
May 27, 1988 in Athens, capital of Greece, and the Guidelines for
the Prevention of Accidents and Incidents on the High Seas and
International Airspaces on September 8, 1988 in Istanbul, the
largest city in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In these two agreements, both countries recognized their
obligations to respect each other's sovereignty and territorial
integrity as well as their rights to use the high seas and
international airspace of the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
Tension has recently escalated between Ankara and Athens,
triggering a string of air and naval incidents in the Aegean. The
main disagreement leading to most of the incidents is the dispute
over territorial waters and airspace.

<P>
LUSAKA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Cultural Associations in Zambia
have been praised by the Zambian government for their value in
preservation and promotion of culture.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government set aside 39 million Kwacha (about
20,000 U.S. Dollars in the 1998 budget for the cultural
associations, Zambia Daily Mail reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Community Development and Social Services Permanent Secretary,
Helen Matanda, said in Kwbwe, central Zambia, on Friday that
cultural administrators need to be equipped with skills to
effectively conduct research and advise the government on changes
deemed necessary, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closure of a research skills training course
for provincial cultural officers, Matanda said that the course is
part of the Community Development Ministry's capacity building
program.
</P>
<P>
The cause aims to improve operations and enhance effectiveness and
efficiency in the service, said the official.

"Technological development has made global communication so
easy that we can literally exchange information with any part of
the world at the touch of a button. These developments have had
an impact on our society," she said.

"Our culture has been globally acknowledged as the basis for
sustainable development and that cultural dimensions of human
life are very essential," she said.
</P>
<P>
Matanda noted that development and economy are part of
people's culture and if development is divorced from its human or
cultural content, it becomes meaningless.

She said it is necessary for everybody to appreciate the
cultural values of each community to ensure that development
strategies meet cultural requirements of the people.
</P>
<P>
She urged officers to carry out their duties more effectively

If the talks can resume on Monday as the earliest, time is
running out for preparing for the opening day of the Football
World Cup finals in the country on June 10, as the preparation
time for pilots to fly planes needs 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
President and Chief Executive Officer of Air France Jean-Cyril

out of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The biggest union of pilots, the SNPL, stepped out of the talks
Saturday morning, a few hours after Spinetta himself left the

</P>
<P>
Only 25 percent of the short, medium- and long-haul planes of
Air France are expected to take off Saturday, Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
The pilots went on strike on June 1 because the air company
planned to reduce their salaries by 15 percent in exchange for its
shares. The strikers also wanted the scrapping of a double system
in pays between older and younger pilots.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Two French nationals and their
small boat were kidnaped Friday by Somali gunmen off the coast of
the Northeastern town of Bossaso.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, the boat of the French men
had been intercepted by another speed boat of Somali gunmen close
to the junction of the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The French men told their abductors that they are tourists who
sailed from the port of Marseille of France through the Canal
Suez and that they were heading towards the island of Madagasar.
</P>
<P>
The French men had a gun with them on the boat. The tourists
told their abductors that they had their gun for merely hunting
purposes.
</P>
<P>
According to the Somali gunmen loyal to the Somali Salvation
Democratic Front (SSDF) who are popular in their sea pirates
operations, the French men had trespassed into their exclusive
economic zone of the sea, getting as close as only three
kilometers to where Somali fishermen were conducting their
fishing business.
</P>
<P>
One of the security officers of SSDF, Said Dhere, told the
journalists that the French men's case will be subjected to a
serious investigation before making any kind of a decision.
</P>
<P>
The head of the gunmen who abducted the French men, Saeed
Bani'adam, said there will be no other way out, but huge ransom
to be paid in an exchange for the release of the French men. He
did not disclose how much money they will ask for.
</P>
<P>
The Northeastern SSDF gunmen who are equipped with speed boats
and assault rifles and heavy machine guns, patrol beyond their
limit in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean for hunting foreign vessels
as their best revenue making business.
</P>
<P>
Each vessel caught is charged with money between 200,000 U.S.
Dollars and 500,000 U.S. Dollars, according to status and
economical standard of the prey.

<HEADLINE> OAU Urges Ethiopia, Eritrea to End Hostilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 5 (Xinhua) -- African ministers of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) urgently appealed to
Ethiopia and Eritrea here Saturday morning to put an end to all
hostilities for a peaceful solution to their border dispute.
</P>
<P>
In a special session which ended at midnight Friday, the OAU
Council of Ministers urged the two parties to do so "at the same
and simultaneously", Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary-General of OAU
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The special session, the second in two days during the 68th
ordinary session of the OAU Council of Ministers starting here
Thursday morning, followed the mutual air bombing Friday by the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia said Friday afternoon that Eritrea air bombed its
northern border town of Mekelle, wounding five civilians, while
Eritrea claimed to be bombed by four Ethiopian fighter planes in
two rounds of attacks against the southern outskirts of its
capital Asmara.
</P>
<P>
The escalation of hostilities followed an urgent session
called by the ministerial council and the Central Organ of the
OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution
Thursday night, when both parties were urged to exercise
restraint to enable a peaceful settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
According to Salim, the session on Friday night heard the
report of the facilitators on the evolution of the situation
between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the two countries also briefed the session,
said Salim.
</P>
<P>
"The spirit of response given by the two parties has been
positive to the appeal by the council," he added.
</P>
<P>
As the appeal represents the collective concern of Africa, the
OAU chief hoped the two parties will pay heed to it.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the gravity of the situation and the loss of
lives," the Council of Ministers meeting "recommends to the heads
of state and government to be immediately seized with the
matter," according to the resolution adopted by the session.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of OAU members states will begin to arrive at the
capital of Burkina Faso to attend the 34th summit of the
continental organization which is to open next Monday.

<HEADLINE> Shortsightedness Plagues Half of Chinese Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Shortsightedness arising from
excessively heavy load of study and lack of care for eyes are
plaguing more and more Chinese adolescents, ophthalmologists
warned.
</P>
<P>
On average, more than half of students across the country have
suffered from myopia, or shortsightedness, in different degrees,
according to a national investigation of students' physical and
health situations.
</P>
<P>
The incidence was about 23 percent in primary schools, 55
percent in junior middle schools, 70 percent in high schools and
77 percent in colleges and universities, said the survey which was
jointly conducted by ministries of Health and Education.
</P>
<P>
The survey result also showed that the incidence in cities was
much higher than that in rural areas, while girls are more
vulnerable to the disease than boys.
</P>
<P>
Long-period tiredness of eyes dominated the causes of
nearsightedness, apart from some hereditary factors, said Dr. Xu
Liang, director of the Beijing Ophthalmological Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
He warned of a rise of the incidence if young people continue
to underestimate the harmfulness of overuse of eyes.
</P>
<P>
However, primary and middle school students have to stick their
eyes to books and blackboards for some eight to ten hours a day,
compared with only one to two hours for them to have a rest,
according to a survey conducted in 93 schools in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Ignorance of prevention and control of overuse of eyes may
lead to not only shortsightedness, but even blindness," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Out of four to five million blind people in China, some 300,000
were victims of serious shortsightedness.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, there is one amblyopia patient among every 30
Chinese children, whose sight defects will not be corrected if
they can not get prompt diagnosis and treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health has designated the sixth day of June as
the National Eye Care Day in a bid to raise awareness of the
public to protect their eyes and help them to increase knowledge
in this field.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Stand on Border Demarcation Dangerous: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has said a recent
Iraqi statement over the U.N. border demarcation between the two
countries was a dangerous step that reflects Iraq's true
intention toward Kuwait, Kuwait News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A Kuwaiti foreign ministry spokesman said on Friday that Kuwait
would take a legal and political action through the Arab League
and the U.N. Security Council in a bid to preserve its rights and
enforce the full implementation of the U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan has reportedly said in
Rabat, Morocco, where he was on a visit, that the U.N. border
demarcation resolution has no legal value.
</P>
<P>
In May 1993, the U.N. Security Council adopted resolution 833,
which delimits the boundary between Kuwait and Iraq. In November
1994, Iraq announced to recognize the boundary.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's recognition of the border between the two countries is
one of the main demands it should meet in relevant resolutions
passed by the U.N. Security Council after Iraq was defeated in the
1991 Gulf War touched off by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti spokesman said Ramadan's statement was a very
dangerous position revealing the true intention of the Iraqi
policy toward Kuwait and international agreements.
</P>
<P>
Rebuffing the statement, the spokesman said the U.N. resolution
has been endorsed by Iraq's National Assembly (parliament),
Revolutionary Command Council and government.
</P>
<P>
This has been officially documented at the United Nations, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Renews Talks Offer to India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif on Saturday renewed his offer for talks with India to
defuse escalated tension between the two countries by solving all
the pending bilateral issues peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"Today I again invite (Indian Prime Minister) Atai Behari
Vajpayee to come forward and put an end to arms race in the
region," Sharif declared Saturday morning in a joint sitting of
the parliament, which was summoned to discuss the situation after
Pakistan went nuclear on May 28.
</P>
<P>
"Quick Indian response to our plea would be in the interest of
the people of the region. India should now forget for ever the
idea to subjugate Kashmiris and continue its occupation of
Kashmir," he said.
</P>
<P>
"A new world is emerging after nuclear tests and now the
international community is realizing the threats to the peace of
South Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The world, he said, is now paying attention to the Kashmir
dispute and they are feeling that South Asia could not see peace
until the Kashmir dispute is settled.
</P>
<P>
"We have been conveying this message to the world for 50 years
and this was the message of our nuclear explosions," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Beat Jazz 93-88 in NBA Finals Game 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan scored 37 points
and Scottie Pippen added 21 to help the Chicago Bulls roll over
the Utah Jazz 93-88 in Game 2 of the NBA Finals in Salt Lake City
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls tied the finals score 1-1 in the best of seven
series. The next three games will be staged in the Bulls
home-court.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Pippen, who scored 13 of 15 points for the Bulls in
the first eight minutes, went on to do big in the fourth quarter,
shooting in all but two of Chicago's points.
</P>
<P>
Toni Kukoc shot all his 13 points in the first half. The
Bulls snatched 18 offensive rebounds and scored 33 points off
Utah's 20 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hornacek scored 20 points and Karl Malone added 16 for
Utah.
</P>
<P>
The first half ended 50-46 in favor of the Bulls, who lost the
first game 85-88 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, Pippen and Kukoc, the big three for the Bulls, scored
all the 23 points in the first quarter, and led all the way from
the very start. But in the second quarter, with Jordan off the
court, the Jazz bench displayed a superb show, beating the Bulls'
counterparts 8-0 in two minutes.
</P>
<P>
During the third quarter, the Bulls had a low 30 percentage of
shooting, while the Jazz stormed back with a 10-0 run to lead the
period 73-70.
</P>
<P>
The final quarter saw Pippen and Jordan each scored a double to
regain the lead with a 11-1 run against their rivals, who failed
to score anything with a frustrating 0-for-6 attacks.
</P>
<P>
The score seesawed from 85-81 to 88-86 until Malone missed a
mid-range shot with 23.4 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
Steve Kerr put in a pair of foul shots to enlarge the gap to
91-86 with 19.5 seconds remaining, and that settled the triumph
for the Bulls.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir: Economic Recovery in Malaysia Takes Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Saturday that his country will take some
time to recover from the current economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
The resilience and sacrifices of the people are needed to face
the situation, Mahathir said. "While we do not reject the role of
outsiders in helping us to deal with the situation, we cannot
totally depend on them."
</P>
<P>
"Recovery will not come easy but we are confident that by
reducing the country's dependence on foreign exchange, we will
somewhat escape the threats of attacks on our currency and the
nation's economy," he said in a speech at the investiture in
conjunction with the birthday of Malaysia's Supreme Head of State
Tuanku Ja'afar here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said various efforts and strategies had been taken by the
government to reduce the impact of the devalued ringgit, including
cutting down on imports and less consumption of essential items
like sugar, flour and milk, encouraging prudent spending,
promoting exports and ensuring that in its trade with other
countries, the ringgit or the currency of the other trading
country was used, and several other measures to revive the
nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the government was confident that Malaysia would
be able to overcome the economic problems it was facing based on
the nation's political and social stability.
</P>
<P>
He said that the people's faith and confidence in the
government was most vital because not all the government's
approaches could be publicly announced.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir pledged that the government would take heed of all the
problems faced by the people and provide assistance to all parties
such as the retrenched workers, traders and small or big
entrepreneurs so that they will not face too much pressure as a
result of factors beyond their control.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir expressed gratitude for the fact that the country had
remained peaceful with the people living in harmony in the wake of
the economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Not to Devalue Dong: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and
Governor of the State Bank of Vietnam Nguyen Tan Dung said that
his country would not devalued its currency "dong", the English
newspaper "Vietnam News" reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's economic and political conditions do not allow
devaluation and floating of the dong, Dung said.
</P>
<P>
The immediate banking priority was to control the monetary and
credit policies aimed at stabilizing the macro economy and
maintaining economic growth in an unexpected, difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
The difficulties include the continued influence of the
monetary and financial crisis in Asia, and the long drought which
has caused a loss of estimated 400 million U.S. dollars, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Dung said that banking activities must be aimed at increasing
the capacity to pay, keeping inflation at a single digit and
taking reasonable measures to maintain the value of dong.
</P>
<P>
However, the deputy prime minister also told a media conference
here on Friday that the Vietnamese government would continue to
take flexible and careful steps to regulate exchange rate in
accordance with the conditions of supply and demand.

ROME, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Rome-based United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) stressed the need for sustainable
use of the world's natural resources to mark World Environment Day
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
This year's theme -- "For Life on Earth -- Save Our Seas" --
was highlighted at the ceremonies held at the FAO headquarters
here.
</P>
<P>
FAO Assistant Director-General Moritaka Hayashi, in charge of
the Fisheries Department, said: "The year 1998 has been declared
the International Year of the Ocean and the oceans are also
central to the theme of the 1998 World Environment Day, which we
are celebrating today."
</P>
<P>
He said environmental issues of fisheries were attracting more
and more attention, and called for efforts to "ensure that the
resources of the seas are utilized and managed in a sustainable,
environmentally acceptable manner" in order to support and feed
the ever-growing world population.

FAO Assistant Director-General in charge of sustainable
development Henri Carsalade said that sustainability and food
security were inseparable.
</P>
<P>
The FAO was convinced that it was "quite possible to meet the

respect for the principles of sustainable development."

<HEADLINE> Canada's Province to Compensate Sterilization Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian province of Alberta
said Friday that it will compensate some 500 people who were
sterilized without their permission before 1972.
</P>
<P>
The settlement will cost the province 33 million U.S. dollars,
or about 69,000 dollars per person, said reports from the province.
</P>
<P>
Most of those included in the package remain in provincial
care, and the deal was struck between Alberta's Justice Department
and a provincially appointed trustee.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the settlement is fair and achieves a reasonable
balance between the interests of the individuals and the interests
of Albertans," Justice Minister Jon Havelock said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 250 to 300 victim claims not covered by Friday's
agreement will be settled on the same basis, Havelock added.
</P>
<P>
Between 1928 and 1972, more than 2,000 Albertans were
sterilized under the province's sterilization act, which was
designed to prevent the mentally handicapped from passing on their
genes to offspring.

<HEADLINE> OAU Urges Ethiopia, Eritrea to End Hostilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 5 (Xinhua) -- African ministers have urgently
appealed to Ethiopia and Eritrea to end all hostilities and to
work for a peaceful solution to their border dispute.
</P>
<P>
In a special session which ended at midnight Friday, the OAU
Council of Ministers urged the two countries to end the conflict
simultaneously, Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary-general of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) said Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The special session, the second in two days during the 68th
ordinary session of the OAU Council of Ministers, was held after
the air raids Friday by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia said Friday afternoon that Eritrea bombed its northern
border town of Mekelle, wounding five civilians, while Eritrea
claimed four Ethiopian fighter planes attacked twice on the
southern outskirts of the capital Asmara.
</P>
<P>
The escalation of hostilities followed an urgent session called
by the Council and the Central Organ of the OAU Mechanism for
Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution Thursday night,
when restraint was urged to enable a peaceful settlement of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
According to Salim, the session on Friday night heard a report
on the unfolding conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
"The spirit of response given by the two parties has been
positive to the appeal by the Council," Salim said.
</P>
<P>
As the appeal represents the collective concern of Africa, the
OAU chief hoped the two parties would pay heed to it.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of OAU members states will begin to arrive at the
capital of Burkina Faso to attend the 34th summit which is to open
next Monday.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Set New Rules for Foreigner Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will soon
complete a new draft of the foreign business law which is expected
to stimulate more capital inflow.
</P>
<P>
A committee reviewing the regulation of foreign business in
Thailand has reached agreement that a working group be set up to
outline what investments would be opened for foreigners, Deputy
Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said in remarks published by
today's Bangkok Post.
</P>
<P>
The working group will have one month to finish the draft
before submitting it to parliament for approval.
</P>
<P>
If the bill is enacted into law, it will replace the Alien
Business Law, which the past four governments had pledged to amend
but later had the process sidelined.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said the new law would allow a wider range of
investment for foreigners, except in businesses concerning
national security, the economy and culture which would be reserved
for Thais only.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would also have more flexibility to
change the lists of reserved occupations at any time.
</P>
<P>
Critical conditions that would benefit Thailand, such as volume
of investment, methods of bringing in capital from abroad and the
number of foreigners to be employed, would be stated in the draft,
Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
He said other related laws including the Insurance Law,
Condominium Act for Foreign Ownership and the Land Law would be
amended simultaneously to allow foreign investors greater
participation.

<HEADLINE> 9 International Banks Named to Back Up Indonesia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
appointed nine international investment banks to assist in the
partial privatization of 12 state companies, press reports
Saturday quoted a government official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The decision was reached after a vigorous and thorough
selection process which involved 22 international banks, said
State Minister for the Empowerment of State Enterprises Tanri
Abeng here Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the selection criteria were designed together with the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government plans to privatize seven state-owned
companies and divest more shares in five publicly listed state
companies in the 1998-99 fiscal year ending March 31, 1999 in a
bid to raise 15 trillion rupiah (about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars)
to support the financially strained state budget.
</P>
<P>
Abeng said the government hopes that the program will help
restore confidence in the country's economy and improve the
competitiveness of state companies.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said the government is willing to lower its
requirement of a 51 percent stake in state companies.
</P>
<P>
"When investors are injecting millions of dollars, or maybe
billions of dollars, they want to have a say in management. We
have to be realistic," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government aims to privatize telecommunications
firm Telkom, international telecommunications carrier Indosat,
cement-making, steel-making and mining companies, and toll road,
airport, plantation and port management companies.

<HEADLINE> Xiamen's Re-Employment Program Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- This special economic zone of east
China's Fujian Province has reported initial success in
implementing its re-employment program.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that a total of 8,302 state-owned
enterprises workers had been laid off in Xiamen by the end of
March this year. However, 5,395 of them have been re-employed.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the smooth implementation of the re-employment
program, which was launched last July, the Xiamen municipal
government has formulated a number of rules and regulations on
re-employment and appropriated nearly 40 million yuan (4.82
million US dollars) to aid the program.
</P>
<P>
Besides financial assistance, Xiamen has also attached keen
importance to training displaced workers. By the end of last year,
a total of 7,899 laid-off workers had been trained, with the
majority having found job again.
</P>
<P>
As China's economic reform goes deeper, a considerable number
of workers have been displaced by state-owned enterprises, which
used to be significantly overstaffed and economically inefficient.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem of mounting unemployment, China has
launched a national re-employment program to train and divert the
laid-off workers, mainly to the service sector.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Releases First Environmental Protection Bulletin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Qinghai Province in northwest China
has recently released its first bulletin on the province's
environmental situation in the year 1997, claiming it has obtained
fruitful results in the field.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable progress has been made in the fields of prevention
and treatment of industrial pollution, ecological environment
building, and adoption of regulations and laws on environmental
protection, said Kang Weixin, director of the Provincial
Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Located in northeast of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the
province has a fragile ecological environment with serious land
erosion, desertification, and grassland degradation problems.
</P>
<P>
The province has launched several large-scale comprehensive
pollution treatment projects for the plateau environment in recent
years. It has set up four nature reserves and two state-level
forest parks, among which, the Qinghaihu Lake and Longbaotan
nature reserves have already been listed as the world's important
wetlands. The number of birds inhabiting the Qinghaihu Lake has
been restored to the record level of 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin shows that the province last year treated eroded
land area of 544,000 hectares; afforesting 35,600 hectares of
land; and improving grassland area of 278,500 hectares. The
province has also made remarkable progress in the comprehensive
treatment of waste gas, waste water, and industrial residue.

<HEADLINE> Most College Graduates Find Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Some 80 percent of the bachelors
who are expected to graduate from Chinese universities this year
have found jobs, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted an Education Ministry official as saying that
"graduate students are the most popular in the job
market". However, they have to face a more market-oriented
employment situation and there is pressure, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The graduates' problems stem from the restructuring of the
government earlier this year, the increase in the number of the
workers laid off by state-owned enterprises and the huge number of
graduates, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
China this year saw the largest number of college graduates
since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949.
</P>
<P>
College students had had no problems in finding jobs until the
early 1990s when China started to change the practice of job
assignment for graduates.
</P>
<P>
To help students who have not found a job, the State Council
has published a circular calling on employers at all levels to
help them and not to neglect them, the paper adds.

<P>
ROME, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) hopes to send

press conference with Italian Premier Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the British EU presidency, Blair said the

Blair arrived in Rome Friday in preparation for the upcoming
European Council in Cardiff, Wales, which will mark the end of the

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Rout Nigeria in World Cup Warm-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Marc Overmars scored one goal and
assisted two others to pace World Cup group E seed the Netherlands
to a 5-1 victory over fellow cup finalists Nigeria in a warm-up
game on Friday in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of injury-sidelined striker Dennis Bergkamp,
most of the Dutch offense was concentrated along the left flank
via Overmars and repeated efforts resulted in goals after the
Nigerians contained the hosts in the first 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Jerrel Hasselbaink connected a cross pass by Overmars for the
opener in the 32nd minute while Patrick Kluivert scored off
another Overmars cross-over in the 60th minute.
</P>
<P>
In the 38th minute, Overmars while dribbling fast into the
penalty area spotted a mispositioning of the Nigerian goalkeeper
who pressed too far away from his goalmouth.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch striker flopped up the ball past the keeper for a
goal of his own.
</P>
<P>
Clarence Seedorf, orchestrating Dutch offense from the opposite
flank, set Kluivert up for his second goal in the game in the 75th
minute while Pierre van Hooijdonk added a fifth two minutes later
to wind up the scoring spree.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch could have scored a couple more goals but Hasselbaink
misjudged his later shots.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria got a consolation goal in the 64th minute when Nwankwo
Kano converted a penalty kick to put the visitors on the
scoreboard as well.

<HEADLINE> WBA Holyfield-Akinwande Fight Called Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Evander Holyfield won't have to
fight Henry Akinwande in the WBA heavyweight title bout on
Saturday after Akinwande tested positive for hepatitis B.
</P>
<P>
The title fight was called off Friday, a day before the
scheduled date in New York.
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'm the guy things happen to," said Holyfield, who was
informed the fight was off when he arrived at Madison Square
Garden for his final pre-fight workout.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield went back to his hotel in the hopes he would get a
last-minute rival, but nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready in shape. If you don't fight, you don't get paid
either," he said.
</P>
<P>
Promoters officially said the fight was postponed
indefinitely. But with Akinwande having tested positive, and
Holyfield fighting him only because it was a mandatory WBA title
defense, it was unlikely Akinwande would get another chance.
</P>
<P>
Two separate tests on Akinwande showed he had hepatitis B, said
Greg Fritz, a spokesman for Don King Productions, the promoter of
the fight.
</P>
<P>
The commission does not allow infected boxers to fight because
of the risk of transmitting the disease through blood during bouts.
</P>
<P>
Hepatitis B, often contracted through sex or dirty hypodermic
needles, can cause serious liver problems.
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing," said Holyfield, who had made no secret of
his lack of desire to fight the WBA's No. 1 contender. "You
prepare yourself for 13 weeks and then this happens."
</P>
<P>
Akinwande was to make $2.5 million to fight Holyfield, who was
to get $10 million for the defense of the WBA title he won in his
first fight with Mike Tyson.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican President Miguel Angel
Rodriguez will demand at the U.N. that the world's wealthier
countries do more in the battle against drugs.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, accompanied by Foreign Minister Roberto Rojas and
Commerce Minister Samuel Guzowski, left for the United States on
Friday to attend the U.N. General Assembly special session on
drugs.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica would ask drug-consuming nations to increase their
efforts against the production, transportation and consumption of
drugs, Rojas said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The position we are taking to New York is that the
countries that consume drugs should also take part in all the
efforts. It is not fair to blame only the producers, which are
poor countries."
</P>
<P>
Representatives of about 150 countries, including 35 heads of
state and government, are to attend the three-day conference which
opens on Monday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials said the conference will focus on issues such as
ways to combat money-laundering, reducing demand, strengthening
judicial cooperation, regulating chemicals used to synthesize
drugs and eliminating the illegal cultivation of poppy, coca and
cannabis crops.
</P>
<P>
During his seven-day trip to the United States, Rodriguez will
meet U.S. politicians such as former President Jimmy Carter and
Senator Paul Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
He will also meet representatives of the 90 most important
companies with investments in Latin America. "The idea is to
promote the country during the meeting, they are going to be told
they are welcome," Rojas explained.

<P>
NEW DELHI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government in a
statement Friday evening criticized the communique issued by
foreign ministers of the five permanent Security Council member
countries (P-5) Thursday over the tense situation in the South
Asian region following the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In their one-day meeting in Geneva, the P-5 asked India and
Pakistan to have direct dialogue to reduce tension, refrain from
weaponization or deployment of nuclear weapons and adhere to the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) immediately and
unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the Kashmir issue, the root cause of
tension between India and Pakistan and urged the two countries to
make efforts to resolve disputes including Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
India in its statement Friday rejected outright any third party
mediation on Kashmir issue. "We reiterate once again that there is
no room for any outside involvement of any nature whatsoever in
this process," the statement said in response to the P-5
communique.
</P>
<P>
The P-5 communique said that India and Pakistan do not have the
status of nuclear weapon state in accordance with the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), notwithstanding their recent
nuclear tests. India in its Friday statement regards itself as "a
nuclear weapon state".
</P>
<P>
The Indian government statement also criticized the nuclear
weapon states for not taking "credible and effective steps" to
establish a comprehensive and equitable regime of nuclear
disarmament in the world.

<HEADLINE> Canada Urges Ethiopia, Eritrea to Resolve Dispute Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 5 (xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister
Lloyd Axworthy today deplored the mounting conflict between
Ethiopia and Eritrea, and urged both sides to resolve their
dispute peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"Canada hopes that there will be a peaceful resolution of the
border issue without further bloodshed," said Axworthy. He called
on both sides to refrain from further fighting and to cooperate
with mediation efforts.
</P>
<P>
Canadian concerns about mounting tensions were earlier conveyed
to the Ethiopian and Eritrean authorities by the Department of
Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
The DFAIT issued a travel advisory today advising Canadians to
defer travel to Eritrea or, if in the country, to depart
immediately. There are approximately 125 Canadians in Eritrea
registered with the Canadian Embassy in Addis Ababa and the
Consulate in Asmara, the Eritrean capital.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has escalated with bombing attacks Friday on Makele in
Ethiopia and on Asmara. The current fighting between the two
countries was precipitated by a border skirmish on May 6.

BONN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Another two people injured in
Germany's worst post-war railroad crash two days ago died in
hospitals Friday evening, bringing the latest death toll to 98,
German officials said.
</P>
<P>
The InterCity Express (ICE), the country's fastest train,
derailed at 11:10 Wednesday morning near the northern German town
of Eschede and slammed into a nearby road bridge, bringing
hundreds of tons of concrete to crash down onto the middle section
of the train.
</P>
<P>
So far, 94 bodies have been recovered from the wreckage and a
nearby slope so far. Another two people died of injuries Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
After two days of intensive work, rescuers have cleared all
crashed train carriages from the debris. At the moment they are
still trying to lift huge chunks of the collapsed bridge in a last
attempt to find out whether there are any more victims under the
debris.
</P>
<P>
Officials expected the rescue operations to be completed late
in the evening so that investigators could make a thorough checkup
of the crash site Saturday to look for possible clues that would
help to make clear how the crash happened.
</P>
<P>
After initial investigations, officials said Friday that a
broken wheel on the first coach of the train could be the most
likely cause for the derailment.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Ready to Work With UNSCOM: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is ready to work with
U.N. arms inspectors and the Security Council on the question of
its disarmament, Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, he told a press conference, such a working manner
should be based on a "professional, technical and scientific
approach."
</P>
<P>
He termed the latest conditions for the arms inspection in Iraq
put forward by the UNSCOM, the U.N. Special Commission in charge
of scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, as "politically
motivated" instead of a "road map" described by UNSCOM head
Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
Butler, who goes to Baghdad next week to talk with Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tareq Aziz on what Iraq should do to show it has
met the requirements under the relevant U.N. resolution, briefed
the Security Council on the UNSCOM's views this week.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Thursday, Butler declined to elaborate
the contents, but said they cover the main priority issues
including prohibited missiles, chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has been far less revealing to us over the years with
respect to its biological program than it has with respect to
chemical or missiles" programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also declined to speculate about actual figures, explaining
that it was "up to Iraq to tell us what the real numbers are -- we
match that with the information we have."
</P>
<P>
Butler said that if Iraq will provide all information and
materials the UNSCOM needs, his report to the Security Council in
October will be "very different" from the previous ones.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf, who came here nine days ago to argue for the lifting of
U.N. sanctions against Iraq, said the UNSCOM' requirements are
"nothing new" but "more vague than what it was before" with an
aim to "complicate the situation."
</P>
<P>
Sahaf said Iraq has implemented all requirements under the
U.N. resolution, urging that sanctions be lifted immediately.
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have died because of the most
severe and inhumane sanctions" in the past seven years, he said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Deadbeat Parents Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Friday passed a
bill which makes it a federal felony for parents to cross state
lines to evade child support.
</P>
<P>
It would apply if the amount owed is 5,000 dollars or more and
the payments are more than one year delinquent.
</P>
<P>
It would also apply if the child lives in a different state
than the parent responsible for the payments, and the parent
"willfully" fails to make the payments.
</P>
<P>
The Deadbeat Parents Act of 1998, sponsored by Representatives
Henry Hyde, a Republican, and Steny Hoyer, a Democrat, will be
signed by President Bill Clinton, according to aides for both
authors.
</P>
<P>
The Senate, which approved a similar bill last year, passed it
by voice vote, without debate. The House overwhelmingly approved
it last month.
</P>
<P>
Parents owing 10,000 dollars or more or those fail to pay for
two years could face up to two years in prison. Parents could also
face fines and would be responsible for making restitution for
unpaid child support.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer said the bill would help close loopholes in the system
which allow parents to slip across state lines to avoid paying
child support, thus leaving children and families in economic
ruins.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves GOP Plan to Cut Spending, Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Friday approved a Republican plan to cut domestic
spending by an additional 101 billion dollars through 2003 and
slice taxes by the same amount.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers voted 216-204 to approve a 1.72 trillion dollar
budget for 1999 containing the reductions. By an early unofficial
count, all but nine Republicans ended up supporting the plan.
</P>
<P>
The vote was held after a frantic, eleventh-hour debate and
bargaining between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, Republican leaders requested unhappy moderates
to support the package because a more modest plan would inevitably
emerge from negotiations with the more centrist Senate. The
leaders also argued that the cuts were just 1 percent of the 9
trillion dollars the government plans to spend over the next five
years.
