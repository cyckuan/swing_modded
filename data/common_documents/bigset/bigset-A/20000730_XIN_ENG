<HEADLINE> Singapore's Third University Started </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The establishment marks many "firsts" in university education
in Singapore. It is the first university in the city, the first
government-funded but privately-managed university, and the first
Singapore university to adopt American curricula.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Singapore Minister for Education and
the Second Minister for Defense Teo Chee Hean said that SMU has
been conceived as Singapore's third university to provide
Singaporeans with more opportunities for a good university
education and to meet the nation's need for a workforce that is
highly-trained.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government hopes that SMU can become a
strategic resource for the community and for Singapore society.
</P>
<P>
"SMU should go beyond being a seat of learning and a repository
of management wisdom to embracing its civic responsibility to be
accessible to the community, to be a resource for enriching
quality of life and to provide opportunities for continuing
education", he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The new university brings together a faculty that will deliver
the curriculum in a way designed to meet specific needs of
different groups of students: undergraduates, post-graduates and
executives.
</P>
<P>
SMU is partnered with the Wharton School of the University of
Pennsylvania in the U.S. under a five-year joint agreement to
create a unique learning and research environment.
</P>
<P>
Its broad -based curriculum, modeled after Wharton's and
adapted for the challenges of doing business for the world from
Asia, adopts a flexible, multidisciplinary approach towards
managing the increasingly complex demands of modern businesses,
notably with an emphasis on computer literacy and high-technology,
company attachments, business visits and student exchange programs.

their relations."

<HEADLINE> Footprints of Prehistoric Creatures Found in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian archeologists recently found
some 40 footprints of giant creatures that lived about 50 million
years ago, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The footprints were found in the course of study on shelly
cliffs dating back to the Cenozoic period in Iran's northeastern
city of Birjand (Khorasan Province), the report said.
</P>
<P>
Early studies showed that the region had been a swamp and full
of
water at the time when the footprints were made, according to Ali
Hassanabadi, an archeology expert at the Cultural Heritage Office
of Birjand. He added that the cliffs contained high percentage of
minerals.
</P>
<P>
The expert, however, did not tell what kind of animal the giant
creatures might be. He said some additional footprints had also
been identified on the cliffs with worn out surfaces, indicating
that these footprints might be of dinosaurs.

<HEADLINE> Yemen Reaffirms Support for Palestinian Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
on Sunday reaffirmed Yemen's support for the Palestinian cause and
for the choices of the Palestinian people in establishing an
independent state with Jerusalem as capital.
</P>
<P>
Saleh made the remarks here while meeting visiting Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat who arrived in Yemen on Sunday after visiting
Saudi Arabia as part of a world tour to rally support for his
declaring statehood by September.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Arafat briefed Saleh on the failure of the
Camp David summit, on steps currently being taken to declare a
Palestinian state within the specified time period and on his talks
with officials in Saudi Arabia and France.
</P>
<P>
Saleh blamed Israel for the failure of 15-day-long peace talks
at Camp David and called for Arab unity and coordination to support
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that no compromise made on the status of
Jerusalem, the core issue between Israel and the Palestinians,
directly resulted in the failure of the Camp David Summit.
Palestinians want full sovereignty in Arab East Jerusalem as
the capital of an independent state they plan to declare. However,
Israelis say Jerusalem is their indivisible and eternal capital.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians were enraged by recent remarks by U.S. President
Bill
Clinton who warned Palestinians against unilaterally declaring a
state.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who is on a world trip to drum up support for the
Palestinian plans to declare an independent state by September,
is due to visit Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian army announced here
Sunday that a group of members of the Iraq-based Mujaheddin Khalq
Organization (MKO) had been chased back into the Iraqi soil when
they attempted to jump the Iranian border with Iraq.

sabotage activities.

including three handmade time bombs, a map of Tehran's military
outposts and strategic facilities, two motorcycles, two 60 mm
mortars with 8 shells, two pistols and eight grenades, the unnamed
source said.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, a major political and military group which had fought
against the Iranian Shah regime before the 1979 Islamic revolution,
was outlawed in 1981 and fled into Iraq following sharp differences
with the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
Labeled by Iran as a "terrorist group," the MKO has launched
numerous cross-border attacks inside Iran in recent years,
including assassinating senior Iranian officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Agriculture Ministers from Europe,
Central Asia, Middle East and Africa are scheduled to meet in
Istanbul in October to discuss cooperation, reported the Anatolia
News Agency on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will convene for the "Agriculture Ministers Summit
from Eurasia to Africa," said Husnu Yusuf Gokalp, Turkish minister
of agriculture and rural affairs, in a statement Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, an international food and food technologies
fair, "Foodtec-2000," will be held in the Turkish capital of
Ankara, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Gokalp said that intense preparations are underway for the fair,
which will be attended by the four regional countries which are
potential markets for food products.
</P>
<P>
The countries will display their products and technical and
technological developments at the fair. They are also expected to
hold contacts with Turkish private sector companies.
</P>
<P>
Conferences will be held on inflow strategies to foreign
markets, food marketing and trademark administration, food
regulations and communication among sectors during the fair.

<HEADLINE> Poland Keen to Develop Trade Ties with Iraq: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Poland is keen to develop trade
ties with Iraq to make up for the heavy losses it suffered in trade
dealings with this country during the past 10 years, a visiting
Polish official said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Trade dealings between Poland and Iraq almost came to a
standstill after the United Nations imposed stringent sanctions on
Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, said Tadeusz Donocik,
undersecretary of the Polish ministry of economy.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between the two countries reached more than 500
million U.S. dollars before the sanctions, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that his visit will bring about the resumption of
meetings of the Joint Polish-Iraqi Committee of Economic
Cooperation, as well as the signing of contracts in different
fields for Poland to export humanitarian goods to Iraq within the
framework of the U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. program, now in its eighth phase, allows Iraq to sell
unlimited amounts of oil to buy humanitarian supplies to alleviate
the impacts of the crippling sanctions on Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi economic delegation is expected to visit Warsaw soon to
enhance bilateral trade ties, Donocik said.
</P>
<P>
Since arriving here on Saturday, Donocik has held talks with
Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammad Mehdi Salah, Minister of Industry and
Minerals Adnan Abd Al-Majid Jasim Al-Ani, and Irrigation Minister
Mahmoud Diyab Al-Ahmad.
</P>
<P>
Poland is just one of the European countries which have been
strengthening trade relations with Iraq in order to gain a slice of
Iraq's big reconstruction market, estimated at about 200 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Two Egyptian Muslims Referred to Prosecutors for Killing Copt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Two Egyptian Muslims were referred to
prosecutors on Sunday after they confessed to killing a Coptic
Christian due to his building of a church in their village south of
the capital, a police report said.
</P>
<P>
Poultry merchant Khaled al-Beheiri, 34, and Tilib al-Beheiri,
46, deputy headmaster of a religious school, both of the same
family, were arrested Friday along with three relatives who have
been cleared of involvement in the murder, state-run Middle East
News Agency quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two men had confessed to killing 42-year-old Coptic
Christian Fakhri Ayyad Mussaad and wounding three others because
Mussaad had built a church in Sul village, it added.
</P>
<P>
The report said Tilib worked for the prestigious 1,000-year-old
Al-Azhar University's preparatory school in Sul.
</P>
<P>
The Beheiris were transferred from a police cell to the custody
of prosecutors of the Atfieh district, which covers the village, in
the first step towards preparing a case against them.
</P>
<P>
Mussaad, who owned a chicken farm in the village was unloading
eggs with three Christian employees in the early hours of Thursday
when they were shot. The three wounded were still in hospital on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Residents said last week that the church Mussaad built was the
first Christian place of worship in the mostly Muslim village,
which is also home to a Coptic minority of 6,000.
</P>
<P>
Egypt witnessed its worst sectarian violence in decades at the

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Presents Report to U.N. on Its Women Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has presented its national
report to the United Nations on the implementation of the Beijing
Platform for Action inked at the 1995 Beijing women's conference,
local media reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 80-page report, divided into three main parts, gave a brief
overview of Cyprus government's efforts to achieve gender equality,
presented the financial and institutional measures available to
women and set out views and information on the critical areas of
concern, relating to women.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that legal reform to eliminate discrimination
and safeguard women's rights in all fields of law and the family
and labour law in particular was pursued, bringing Cyprus' domestic
laws in line with relevant international norms.
</P>
<P>
It said efforts were also made to harmonize Cyprus' norms with
the rules and regulations of the European Union and to promote
equal pay for women and the protection of maternity.
</P>
<P>
Training programs to advance balanced representation of women
and men in politics took place with a view to encourage women to
engage in politics, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, local reports said that inequality in the workplace
still
exists, putting women at a disadvantage position.
</P>
<P>
Women in Cyprus make up 38.85 percent of the active workforce,
but they account for 54.41 percent of the unemployed and 55.66
percent of those who have stayed unemployed for more than six
months.
</P>
<P>
There are also large salary differences, with an average monthly
pay of 759 Cyprus pounds (1,518 U.S. dollars) for men and 546
pounds (1,092 dollars) for women.
</P>
<P>
Figures for Cyprus also indicated that one in four women become
victims of violence in the family.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Stepping up Natural Gas Projects With Iran, Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is stepping up construction
of natural gas projects both with Russia and Iran in a bid to
mitigate its shortage of energy, Anatolia News Agency reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ankara is also rebuilding the Tarutina Compressor station
within Ukraine borders to increase the capacity of the current
natural gas pipeline via Ukraine from Russia to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline carries 16 billion cubic meters of natural gas from
Russia to Turkey every year. With the operation of the compressor
station to be started in the fourth quarter of this year, the
capacity of the pipeline will increase by 3.8 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Construction of a new gas pipeline beneath the Black Sea linking
Russia and Turkey, namely the Blue Stream, was under way
intensively.
</P>
<P>
The project which started in February, was expected to deliver
365 billion cubic metres of gas from Russia production sites to
Turkey over 25 years from 2001.
</P>
<P>
Faced with growing energy demands, Turkey is also expected to
start purchasing 3 billion cubic metres of gas annually from
Iran as of September 2001 through a pipeline running from Iran's
northwestern Tabriz to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Under a 1996 agreement, Turkey pledged to buy natural gas from
Iran over 23 years, supplied by the pipeline, and complete its
section of the conduit by January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
But Turkey has failed to meet the deadline and said in February
that it will not be able to complete the pipeline until the end of
2000.
</P>
<P>
With full U.S. backing, Turkey is pursuing a multi-million
dollar
pipeline project -- which excludes routes through both Russia and
Iran -- to carry natural gas from Turkmenistan through the Caspian
Sea to western markets via Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has voiced opposition to the Turkish-Iranian
deal on the grounds that it was a rival to the trans-Caspian
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
To appease Washington, Ankara repeatedly said the trans-Caspian
pipeline is a priority and even postponed the construction of the
Tabriz-Ankara pipeline.
</P>
<P>
But the trans-Caspian pipeline seems a long-term project without
sight. Growing and urgently-needed energy demands prompted Ankara
to complete the immediate construction of the two projects both
with Russia and Iran as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Turkey will receive the Iranian natural gas on the border region
in its eastern Dogubeyazit. It was reported that more than 50
percent of the pipeline between Dogubeyazit and Seydisehir town,
central Konya province, has been finalized so far. The pipeline
will end in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that with the two projects, Turkey will
increase its natural gas supply greatly as of 2001.

<P>
RIYADH, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat held talks on Sunday with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz on the failed three-way Camp David summit and other
Arab, Islamic and international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Aziz, also Deputy Prime Minister and Commander of the
National Guards, received Arafat in the Saudi Red Sea port city of
Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Arafat kept Abdul-Aziz posted on the outcome
of the Camp David summit which was a fiasco and on the latest
developments in the Arab, Islamic and international arenas.
</P>
<P>
Coming from Paris, Arafat arrived in Jeddah on Sunday in a trip
to several Arab and European countries to explain what happened in
the Camp David summit and mull over the latest developments of the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two-week Camp David summit attended by Arafat, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and U.S. President Bill Clinton ended in
failure last week without any agreement on the final-status issues
between Israel and the Palestinians. Both sides refused to make any
concession on the status of Jerusalem, which was believed to be the
major cause to the summit failure.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Israel Agree on Flight Path Between Cairo, Gaza </HEADLINE>

<P>
CAIRO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Israel have reached a
compromise on flight paths between Cairo and Gaza under Palestinian
self-rule, ending a three-month dispute, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The civil aviation authorities (CAA) of the two countries have
agreed after several rounds of talks that the flight path to and
from Gaza will now pass 24 kilometers north of Egypt's El Arish on
the Mediterranean coast of the Sinai peninsula, said an Egyptian
aviation official, who declined to be named. He did not say when
the two countries reached the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Egypt wanted flights to and from Gaza to use a flight path 48
kilometers north of El Arish while Israel, citing security reasons,
insisted on the path being used 16 kilometers north of the town.
The agreement on 24 kilometers reflected the compromise on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's CAA has alerted the world's airlines that the flight
path will begin to be used from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On May 3, Israeli security services turned back a flight from
Egypt after preventing it from landing at Gaza airport.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security services control air traffic in and out of Gaza
under agreements signed with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> German Politicians Denounce Rightist Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Berlin, July 30 (Xinhua) -- German politicians have called on
the public not to tolerate the repeated violence by right
extremists against foreigners and minorities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, quoted by DPA, the German
News Agency, believed that hatred against foreigners is "the most
possible background" in Thursday's bombing in a underground train
station in Dusseldorf, in which 10 people, mostly are foreign
immigrants, were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The incident should "awaken us", said Fischer, adding "the
point has been reached, that the otherwise silencing majority
should no longer keep silence."
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Gerta Daeubler-Gmelin told a Frankfurt daily
that she is concerned that many penetrators of the hate-crime
indulged in the belief of being supported by people around them.
</P>

Peter Struck, parliamentary leader of the ruling Social
Democratic Party,demanded authorities intensify monitoring on

<HEADLINE> UK Airports Operator Hit By Duty Free Abolition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- BAA, the British airports operator,
suffered a 9 percent fall in first-quarter profits following a
sharp drop in retail income at its UK airports because of the
scrapping of intra-EU duty-free sales.
</P>
<P>
BAA Chief executive Mike Hodgkinson said: "While the special
circumstances of the lead-up to the abolition of intra-EU duty
free this time last year make both comparisons and forecasts very
difficult, retail has performed ahead of plan in the quarter."
</P>
<P>
Retail income for the three months to the end of June fell 11
percent to 113 million pounds compared with the same period last
year. Income per passenger was down 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
BAA recovered some of the lost income by raising airport
landing and parking charges for airlines at Heathrow, Gatwick and
Stansted. This resulted in a 9.5 percent increase in airport
charges to 161 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
But it was not enough to prevent pretax profits for the period
slipping from 155 million pounds to 141 million pounds, said BAA.

<HEADLINE> UK Stores In Fight For Longer Sunday Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Big retailers in Britain are to
campaign for longer opening hours on Sundays, Financial Mail
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Supermarkets and shopping centers plan to lobby the Government
for a change in the rules that say they may open for just six
hours.
</P>
<P>
The move will enrage religious campaigners and shopworkers'
unions. They vigorously opposed the change in the law in 1994 that
finally allowed large stores to trade on Sunday on a limited basis.
</P>
<P>
The change came in the wake of a campaign that saw hundreds of
shops flout the law by opening seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
According to industry sources, the big four supermarkets -
Tesco, Sainsbury, Safeway and Asda - have already decided to
spearhead a campaign aimed at putting pressure on the Government.
</P>
<P>
Tesco has already fired the first salvo by announcing this
month that it is extending Sunday delivery times of its online
grocery service to 10pm.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that a forthcoming Government White Paper on
licensing reform will include plans to extend hours when alcohol
may be sold.

ISLAMABAD, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Deposed Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Sunday allowed his Pakistan Muslim League (PML) to hold a "
constructive and meaningful dialogue" with the military government.
</P>
<P>
"I would welcome any constructive and meaningful dialogue with
the present regime. However, it has to be based on reciprocity and
sincerity of purpose and on the basis of mutual respect," Sharif
said in a written speech read out at a PML meeting here, according
to private press agency News Network International.
</P>
<P>
"Let us ... present a viable, fair and balanced political
solution to the present stalemate," said Sharif in his speech.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said he believed dialogue would be the inevitable choice
for PML and the former ruling party should avoid confrontation
with the military regime.
</P>
<P>
Insisting that the "confrontation" has not been initiated by
his party, Sharif said the situation since October 12, 1999, the
day when the army dismissed the PML government and seized the
power, was before all to judge and decide.
</P>

The ousted prime minister is currently under custody after
being awarded life imprisonment in a hijacking case. He has also

HUHHOT, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China's vast western region should
take advantage of its abundant tourism resources and develop a
healthy industry, according to Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen.
</P>
<P>
The industry should make efforts to attract overseas funds,
offering preferential policies, said Qian, who recently visited
west China's Gansu and Qinghai provinces, as well as north China's
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
While carefully planning the development of tourism industry,
local governments should pay more attention to the construction of
communications facilities around major western cities and scenic
spots, Qian stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the protection and improvement of the
western region's environment plays a crucial role in the
development of the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China's western region may open a number of tour
routes and establish a group of nation-wide places of interest,

<HEADLINE> Levy Says He Is to Resign on Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy announced on Sunday that he will resign from the government on
Wednesday "if there is no serious effort to form a national unity
government between now and Wednesday."
</P>
<P>
Levy has already informed Prime Minister Ehud Barak and party
leaders of Likud, Shas and other political parties about his
intention, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Levy said he will abstain from the no-confidence vote
against Barak in the Knesset (parliament) slated for Monday tabled
by Likud.
</P>
<P>
Levy met again with Barak at noon on Sunday after the weekly
cabinet meeting, but he said nothing about his threatened
resignation from the government.
</P>
<P>
Barak published a communique Sunday morning saying that the
government's emphasis now would be on improving social and economic
conditions in the country, in the wake of the failure of the Camp
David peace summit.
</P>
<P>
The move was seen by some observers as aimed to placate Levy who
threatened to leave the government over the "concessions" Barak
offered to the Palestinians at the Camp David summit..
</P>
<P>
Though Levy has not publicly detailed the concessions that so
angered him, he has made it clear that the Jerusalem issue troubles
him the most.
</P>
<P>
Barak is bracing for the possibility that a no-confidence vote
in the Knesset on Monday could topple his government, unless he can
persuade Foreign Minister David Levy not to quit before the voting.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that Monday's no-confidence
vote is crucial for Barak. If Levy abstains or stays away from the
vote, he would not hurt the government, because Barak would not be
toppled unless 61 members, an absolute majority of the 120-member
Knesset, support the motion.
</P>
<P>
Levy's Gesher (bridge) party formed One Israel alliance with
Barak's Labor after the May elections in 1999. It has two seats in
the Knesset.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians End First Meeting since Summit in Jericho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
ended their first meeting on interim issues since the collapse of
the Camp David summit in the West Bank town of Jericho Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
During the recent Camp David talks that ended without reaching a
peace deal, the two sided agreed to resume negotiations on interim
issues on Sunday, said Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erakat.
</P>
<P>
However, Erakat said the 15-day marathon Camp David summit was
not a failure as the two sides were committed to exert joint
efforts to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Erakat and his Israeli counterpart Oded Eran discussed interim
issues such as Israel's last redeployment in the West Bank and the
release of more Palestinian detainees. No details of the meeting
were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
On the bilateral cooperation, commander of Palestinian
Preventive Security in Gaza Mohammed Dahlan was expected to discuss
with Israeli Interior Minister Shlomo Bin Ami on security issues.

<HEADLINE> UAE Calls for Bigger Role of France in Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
has called on France to play a more active role in the Mideast
peace process, the country's official WAM news agency reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by UAE Deputy Prime Minister Sultan Bin
Zayed al-Nahyan on Sunday at a special meeting with French
Ambassador to UAE Jean-Francois Thibault.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Sultan spoke highly of the efforts made by
French President Jacques Chirac, especially his stance towards the
Middle East Peace process.
</P>
<P>
"President Chirac's support for Arab rights and his calls for
respect of the international legitimacy to achieve a just and
permanent peace in the Middle East are received by all Arab
countries with all appreciation and respect," Sultan told the
envoy.
</P>
<P>
Sultan also reiterated the UAE firm stance towards the peace
process and the country's support for Palestinian negotiators.
</P>
<P>
"The UAE will continue its support for the Palestinian people
until they regain their legal rights to establish their independent
state with Jerusalem as its capital," Sultan added.
</P>
<P>
The French envoy conveyed, in return, to Sultan the appreciation
and thanks of the French leadership and government for the cable of
condolences earlier sent by Sultan to Chirac on the crash of the
Concorde.

<HEADLINE> Road Accident Kills 8 in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A collision between a car and a
pickup truck on a major road in southwestern Iran left 8 dead and
several injured on Sunday, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Six of the victims were killed on the spot while two others died
in hospital, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, the tragedy occurred when one of the
tires of the pickup burst and the vehicle was dragged to the
opposite side of the Izeh-Shahr-e Kord road, which is the sole
route linking the province of Khuzestan and the province of
Chahalmahal and Bakhtiyari.
</P>
<P>
Road accidents are on the rise in Iran. Traffic experts believe
that the narrowness of roads, heavy traffic and non-observation of
traffic laws by drivers are the main reasons for deadly accidents.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted in this regard revealed that some 200,
000 accidents take place on Iranian highways each year resulting in
the death of 15,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Top Financial Regulator Resigns Over Fund Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Japan's State Minister and Financial
Reconstruction Commission (FRC) Chairman Kimitaka Kuze resigned
Sunday over his receipt of questionable funds from Mitsubishi
Trust and Banking Corp. and condominium developer Daikyo Inc.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori immediately appointed
former Economic Planning Agency chief Hideyuki Aizawa as Kuze's
successor Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Kuze became Japan's top financial regulator on July 4, when
Mori launched his new cabinet after last month's general election
of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
He is the second FRC chief to resign from the post in six
months, following Michio Ochi, who quit the post in February after
making remarks suggesting leniency in the inspection of banks.
</P>
<P>
Kuze first came under fire Friday when it was revealed that
Mitsubishi Trust paid tens of millions of yen to set up and staff
an office for Kuze in downtown Tokyo for six years until 1994.
</P>
<P>
Reports of Kuze's involvement with Mitsubishi Trust were
followed by a fresh revelation that Kuze received 100 million yen
(about 917,000 dollars) from the president of Daikyo in 1991 to
help him recruit new members of the Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Kuze's resignation came after Japanese opposition parties
intensified their criticism of Mori, who appointed Kuze to head
the FRC even though he was aware that Kuze had accepted
consultation fees from the bank.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Mori said that he knew about Kuze's connections with
Mitsubishi Trust, but appointed him as FRC head because he thought
it posed no legal or moral problems.
</P>
<P>
But the Japanese prime minister changed his mind and decided to
replace Kuze after the scandal involving Daikyo came to light,
sources of the ruling parties said.

CHENGDU, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Four suspects have been arrested
recently by police in Chengdu, Sichuan's provincial capital in
southwest China, for allegedly causing 170,000 yuan in economic
losses to a local telecom department.
</P>
<P>
The four allegedly bought nine 130 SIM cards with forged
identification cards from the Sichuan branch of the China United
Telecom (China Unicom) between late April and early June.
</P>
<P>
They applied to China Unicom for IDD services and then resold
the cards to some people in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in
northwest China each at a price of 1,500 yuan (181 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The cards were later used by these people in Xinjiang to make
international calls which saw the company loose 170,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom is the only State-owned telecommunications company
involved in all aspects of the sector, including mobile phones,

who turn their crops fields back to forests and grass lands.
</P>
<P>
He asked localities to combine reforestation efforts with
securing long-term livelihood of the farmers, restructure the
agricultural sector and carry out the central government's
policies of compensations and farmer household contracts.
</P>
<P>
Only in this way can crop fields be actually turned back to
forests and grass lands and remain afforested without being
cultivated again, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the experimental projects should introduce new
methods according to requirements of developing a socialist market
economy. For example, local governments should pay sapling
subsidies directly to farmers in cash and let them buy saplings on
the market. This will enable farmers to choose saplings suitable
for their own fields and increase the survival rate of trees and
vegetation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said localities should change their practice of
distributing saplings by government order and encourage farmers to
nurture saplings. The sapling industry should become a new source
of income for local farmers and an impetus to restructuring local
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Zhu asked localities to focus on agriculture and grain products
despite the current surplus supply of grain. Noting that the
drought has reduced summer crops this year and affected the income
of farmers, Zhu said the local governments should take concrete
measures to increase farmers income and secure grain production.
These factors are crucial to the success of long-term
reforestation.

<P>
Localities are also urged to improve supervision in order to
guarantee the quality of the experimental projects.
</P>
<P>
Zhu emphasized that turning crops fields back to forests and
grass lands is of great significance in protecting the environment
in western China. He said that people should brace themselves for
long and arduous job ahead of them which will take several
generations to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
He said the work requires a systematic plan and need to be done
gradually with initial emphasis on the experimental projects.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that localities should pay attention to the
realizing the final hard fruits of their work and avoid making any
rash short-term decisions. He called the people to draw lessons
from the unsuccessful attempts that some localities made in
turning crops fields back to forests and grass lands several years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said people should focus on efficiency rather than speed
and guarantee quality of their work and called for localities to
set work targets according to their specific managing capabilities
and practical conditions and avoid expanding the area and scope of
experimental projects blindly.
</P>
<P>
He said the localities must secure success of the experimental
projects so that they can later turn larger areas of crops fields
back to forests and grass lands.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that localities should fully respect the will of
local farmers in doing their work. They are not allowed to force
farmers to act against their will and ask them to meet uniform
requirements without considering their specific situations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu requested localities to consult with farmers and experts
and carry out feasibility studies before deciding whether certain
areas of crops fields will be reforested and what varieties of
trees or grass will be planted.

The meeting called for relevant parties to resume their due
responsibilities and cooperate closely. It set forward several key
tasks.
</P>
<P>
First, local governments should fully motivate the grass root
levels by perfecting relevant policies and measures, especially
the policy of giving grain, cash and saplings as compensation to
every rural household that reduces crops fields.
</P>
<P>
Second, localities should prepare adequate saplings of trees
and grass to meet the demand of reforestation. Authorities should
improve construction of sapling bases and encourage collectives
and individuals to nurture saplings.
</P>
<P>
Third, localities should develop and provide scientific and
technological support for reforestation. They should spread use of
new techniques and breeds to increase experimental projects.
Meanwhile, they should strengthen technical training of rural
households.
</P>
<P>
Localities should carefully draft plans and procedures and put
forward detailed measures of turning crops fields back to forests
and grass lands by thoroughly studying the historical and
environmental conditions of different specific localities.

QINGDAO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese scientists said
here today aquatic farms will become a major source of nutrition
for the Chinese people by 2030.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yiyu, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, told a national seminar today that the Chinese oceans
will provide a huge potential for improving food for the country.
</P>
<P>
By 2030, the population of China is expected to reach 1.5
billion, placing greater pressure on the country's arable lands
that account for only seven percent of the world total.
</P>
<P>
Chen and a group of scientists pointed out that China's output
of aquatic farms now makes up over 80 percent of the world total.
In the next few years, aquatic farms will grow up to 50 percent
of the total fishery output in China.
</P>
<P>
Chen said rapid growth of aquatic farms will ease pressure on
arable land, create more job opportunities, increase exports and
promote economic development in coastal areas.

<HEADLINE> Levy To Remain In Israeli Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy did not submit his resignation letter to Prime Minister Barak
during their Sunday meeting and for the time being he will not
leave the coalition, Israel Radio also reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Levy met with Barak at noon on Sunday after a weekly cabinet
meeting, but he said nothing about his threatened resignation from
the government.
</P>
<P>
Barak published a communique Sunday morning, saying the
government's emphasis now will be on improving social and economic
conditions in the country, in the wake of the breakdown of the Camp
David summit held on July 11-25.
</P>
<P>
Barak's remarks were seen by some observers as designed to
placate Levy who threatened to leave the government.
</P>
<P>
Barak was bracing for the possibility that a no-confidence vote
in the Knesset (parliament) on Monday could topple his government,
unless he could persuade Foreign Minister David Levy not to quit
before the voting.
</P>
<P>
Levy said Thursday that he would resign from the government over
the "concessions" Barak offered to the Palestinians at the Camp
David summit. If Levy quitted, he might support a no-confidence
motion tabled against Barak by the opposition Likud party.
</P>
<P>
Though Levy has not publicly detailed the concessions that so
angered him, he has made it clear that the Jerusalem issue troubles
him the most.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Barak's One Israel alliance believe that it is hard
for Levy to quit right now, due to the fact that if he brings down
the government by voting against Barak in the no-confidence motion,
he will be barred by law from joining the Likud or any other
political party ahead of the next elections.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that Monday's no-confidence
vote is crucial for Barak. If Levy abstains or stays away from the
vote, he will not hurt the government, because Barak will not be
toppled unless 61 members, an absolute majority of the 120-member
Knesset, support the motion.
</P>
<P>
Levy's Gesher (bridge) party formed One Israel alliance with
Barak's Labor party after the May elections in 1999. It has two
members of the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
If Shimon Peres is elected president by the Knesset on Monday,
his Knesset seat will be given immediately to Mordechai Mishani of
Gesher under an agreement signed by the two sides last year.
</P>
<P>
With Levy staying in the government, he will help Barak fight
the no-confidence motion on Monday, which will help Barak pass the
political storm after his return from the Camp David summit.

<HEADLINE> Seoul, Pyongyang Reach Agreement at Inter-Korean Ministerial Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Seoul and Pyongyang agreed here on
Sunday to hold regular inter-Korean ministerial meetings, reopen
liaison offices in Panmunjom and launch an inter-Korean
reconciliation week to mark the August 15 Liberation Day from the
Japanese colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
Both delegations did their best to produce results under a
friendly atmosphere, said South Korean Vice Culture and Tourism
Minister Kim Soon-kyu, who attended the two rounds of meetings
held at the Shilla Hotel in central Seoul.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the senior officials from South
Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to meet
in Seoul in eight years.
</P>
<P>
"We've agreed to normalize liaison offices" between the two
sides which have not been functioning since 1996, under the spirit
of the June 15 Joint Declaration, Kim said.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was signed on the 15th of last month between
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and DPRK leader Kim Jong Il,
at the first summit between the north and south of the Korean
Peninsula since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
"We've reached an agreement to create an Inter-Korean
Reconciliation Week around the August 15 Liberation Day and hold
ceremonies simultaneously to support the June 15 Joint Declaration,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Kim disclosed that the two sides will issue a joint statement
Monday morning on the results of Sunday's meetings, which is
expected to stress the desire and wishes of both sides to
implement the June 15 Joint Declaration and reconstruct the Seoul-
Shinuiju Railway as well as other economic, social and cultural
cooperation projects.
</P>
<P>
At the meetings, South Korean Unification Minister Park Jae-kyu
and DPRK Senior Cabinet Counselor Jon Kum-jin agreed in principle
to reconstruct the railway linking Seoul and DPRK's northwestern
city of Shinuiju, enhance inter-Korean economic cooperation and
increase cultural, sports and other exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"I expect good results under the spirits of friendly
compromises. We are of one mind when it comes to a desire to
faithfully implement the June 15 Joint Declaration," Park said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Kim Jong Il will be able to visit
Seoul and proposed the second inter-Korean ministerial meeting be
held in Pyongyang in August.
</P>
<P>
DPRK chief delegate Jon Kum Jin said: "I am convinced we will
be able to give the nation a nice present tomorrow as the first
meeting proceeded smoothly. We've come here to carry out our duty
to further the historic June 15 Joint Declaration by producing
results."
</P>
<P>
"Let's not let the warmth of the (inter-Korean) summit cool; we
have to contribute to it and pursue the mission of opening an era
of reconciliation, consolidation and unification," Jon said.
</P>
<P>
Jon stressed the importance of solving inter-Korean issues
under the principle of self-reliance to develop the spirit of
inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation fostered by the June
15 Joint Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The 25-member DPRK delegation, including seven reporters and
cameramen, flew into Seoul Saturday noon via Beijing.

more money such as annual charity singing and dancing performances,
street donation-collection involving 10,000 people, and charity
fairs.
</P>
<P>

10,000 enterprises have participated in donating money to the
Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Shas Still Holds Key to Israeli Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Just a day before Israeli
presidential race, the ultra-Orthodox Shas, the third largest party
in the Knesset (parliament), is seen as still holding the key to
the final outcome of the election.
</P>
<P>
The election of the eighth president of Israel will be held on
Monday in a secret ballot in the 120-member Knesset. Each of the
two candidates, Shimon Peres from the ruling Labor Party and Moshe
Katsav from the opposition Likud, needs at least 61 votes to be
elected.
</P>
<P>
As the race is entering the final stage, both candidates and
their aides are turning their eyes toward Shas which has pivotal 17
seats in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Shas' decision-making body, the Council of Torah Sages, is to
meet on Sunday to decide whether to support Peres or Katsav, or to
grant its Knesset members (MKs) freedom to vote as they wish in the
secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
Aides to Peres, a former prime minister and a Nobel Peace Prize
laureate, believe that if Shas MKs are allowed to vote freely,
Peres will receive 30-40 percent of the party's votes. In that
case, Peres will get an almost guaranteed victory.
</P>
<P>
Katsav, a former deputy prime minister, met with Shas spiritual
leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef on Friday in a last-ditch effort to
convince him to order his MKs to support him in the vote.
</P>
<P>
From the start of the campaign, Katsav has focused on winning
the backing of Shas, saying often that its 17 legislators will be
the key to his victory.
</P>
<P>
Katsav, like Shas supporters, is a Sephardic Jew with origins in
the Arab world and more observant of Jewish law than Peres is. He
has met with countless Shas-affiliated rabbis and stressed that
having a president who keeps kosher and Shabbat will bring a
different atmosphere to Beit Hanassi, the presidential residence.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres has so far secured more guaranteed votes and is
still believed to have a significant edge over Katsav.
</P>
<P>
There is considerable optimism in the Peres camp that even with
the full support of Shas, it is unlikely that Katsav will manage to
defeat Peres.
</P>
<P>
However, the Katsav camp has declared that the race is tight.
People close to Katsav said the current crisis over Foreign
Minister David Levy's threat to leave Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
One Israel can help Katsav gain votes from the left who want to
prevent Levy's Gesher (Bridge) party ally, Mordechai Mishani, from
entering the Knesset if Peres wins and must quit his seat.
</P>
<P>
Levy has been in discord with Barak over Barak's handling of the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and refused to accompany him to
the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
Barak, at the same time, is facing a vital no-confidence vote in
the Knesset on Monday after the presidential election. The
opposition has been very aggressive and determined to topple the
government. Levy and his supporters' vote are seen as pivotal in
deciding whether Barak will survive the vote.
</P>
<P>
Peres' aides worry that some of his natural supporters may opt
for abstentions in the vote over concern that Levy and his
supporters may vote against the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here see good chances that Levy may choose to
stay in the cabinet as he will be barred by law from running the
next Knesset election if he brings down the government.
</P>
<P>
Whatever decision Levy makes, Shas' votes remain important for
the outcome of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Shas leader Eli Yishai briefed the Council of Torah Sages on the
candidates on Thursday but was told to return on Sunday with a
better estimate of each candidate's chances of success so as to
make an informed decision on the winning side.
</P>
<P>
Despite the proximity of Katsav's social background with Shas'
voters, Shas is unlikely to decide on a unanimous vote for Katsav.
</P>
<P>
Besides a good personal relationship with Shas' mentor Rabbi
Yosef and former Shas leader Aryeh Deri, Peres has also a big
advantage among the ultra-Orthodox group - his proven record for
working to defer army service of yeshiva (Jewish religious school)
students.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party got a big applause from Shas by casting
unanimous favorable votes for and helping press for the passage of
the Tal bill on the deferment of the conscription of yeshiva
students by the army when it was submitted for first reading in the
Knesset in early July. The Likud, however, voted against the bill.
</P>
<P>
Shas' desire to be on the winning side, plus Peres' good rapport
with the party, could clinch the vote for Peres, who resigned as
Minister of Regional Cooperation to stand as a candidate for the
race.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a secret ballot is characterized by uncertainties
in the election. It is still too early to say who will be the final
winner.
</P>
<P>
If neither Peres nor Katsav obtains the required 61 votes,
another round of voting will be held on Monday afternoon. If there
is no winner with at least 61 votes in the second round, the race
will be determined in subsequent rounds by a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
The new president, the first one to be elected for a seven-year
term, will be sworn in on Tuesday evening. The country's presidents
used to serve five years with an option for another term.
</P>
<P>
Former President Ezer Weizman made the resignation decision at
the end of May after the state prosecutor issued a final report on
his gift-taking scandal. He formally resigned on July 10.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Expert Warn Of Deteriorating Eco-System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese expert today warned that
with booming economic development, China's environment is getting
worse.
</P>
<P>
Chen Qingtai, deputy director of the Development and Research
Center of the State Council, made these comments at the 2000 China
International Forum on Oceanic Science-Technology and Economic
Development, which opened today in this coastal city in east China
's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
"Frequent sand storms in north China and reports of red tides
in east China's coastal areas are the results of a deteriorating
eco-system," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
China has suffered severe soil erosion over the past years,
with an increase of soil-eroded area to 1.8 million square
kilometers, he said, adding that soil erosion makes up one fifth
of the country's total territory.
</P>
<P>
Soil erosion has also caused poverty for countless people.
</P>
<P>
Desertification has become a serious problem in recent years,
the expert pointed out. Desert area is expanding at some 2,640
square kilometers per year.
</P>
<P>
Twelve sand storms hit Chinese capital Beijing in the first six
months of the year.

Chen also disclosed that China's farming land had decreased by
420,000 square kilometers over the past fifty years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics reveal that among last year's 10 most polluted
cities in the world, eight are in China, three more than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In general, eco-systems in many Chinese cities have worsened.
Air pollution in a number of cities has continued to get worse.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a lot of rivers, lakes and reservoirs across the
country have reported diversified pollution damaging aquatic eco-
systems.
</P>
<P>
Pollution also brought into red tides and other problems for
China's oceans.
</P>
<P>
"Water shortage in China's northwest areas is the root cause
for the country's poor eco-system," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Problems facing the fragile eco-system in China are issues that
will be discussed by more than 70 Chinese and overseas oceanic
scientists attending the two-day forum.

<HEADLINE> Science Education Serial Books for Children Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The publication of the "Collection
of Science Education Books for Chinese Children" provides the
Chinese kids an excellent opportunity to learn about scientific
developments around the globe.
</P>
<P>
A seminar on the launching of the books was held here today.
Educators said that these books will help nurture scientific and
innovative spirit among children, as well as promote quality-
oriented education.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education invited scientists from universities

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Calls for Concerted Efforts to Reduce Unemployment Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Vice-President Simon
Muzenda has called for concerted efforts to reduce the country's
high rate of unemployment to acceptable levels, The Sunday Mail
reported.
</P>
<P>
The high unemployment rate was a threat to political security
in the country, Muzenda said when he delivered a speech at the
opening of the Midlands provincial agricultural show on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that macro economists considered an unemployment rate
of between 3 and 5 percent as a destabilizing factor for the
economy, but Zimbabwe's unemployment rate was far above 50 percent,
which resulted in reduced revenue for the government and
destabilized the country's political security through social
unrests.
</P>
<P>
"One of the government's major concerns is to reduce the
current high rate of unemployment. Appropriate strategic
solutions to the problem of high unemployment in our country can
only be successful when they are seen in the context of a stable
and continued economic growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda mentioned the three measures that the government should
take to stimulate and create economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The first measure for the government is to create conditions
attractive to both local and international investors. The second
one is the introduction of an interest rate regime, which can
stimulate new domestic private sector investment and the third is
that the government should intensify public sector investment in
infrastructure that can improve industrial and agricultural
productivity.
</P>
<P>
He said this year and the last year were economically difficult
ones for Zimbabwe as they were wrought with monetary problems
resulting from the depressed economy.
</P>
<P>
Other problems, he said, were the fall of the local currency
against major currencies, the absence of balance of payment
support, high inflation and interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges FAO to Help Alleviate Plight of Iraqi People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has appealed to the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to help alleviate
the plight of the Iraqi people under U.N. sanctions, the official
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf,
Iraqi Agriculture Minister Abdul Ellah Hameed urged the U.N.
organization to move quickly to handle the deteriorating
humanitarian situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Hameed said his ministry has been making efforts to push for the
lifting of the decade-old sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Hameed accused the United States and British
delegates at the U.N. Sanctions Committee for blocking vital
agricultural contracts Iraq signed with other countries, the INA
said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly condemned the U.S. and Britain for impeding
the implementation of the U.N. oil-for-food program by putting on
hold contracts to import food, medicine and other humanitarian
goods.
</P>
<P>
The FAO director-general paid a fact-finding visit to Iraq at
the end of last month, shortly after two FAO staffers were killed
by a gunman in the Iraqi capital Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
However, Diouf disclosed nothing to the media about his talks
with Iraqi officials on the tragic incident. Instead, he promised
his organization will continue to make efforts to better implement
the U.N. humanitarian program.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program, now in its eighth phase, allows Iraq
to sell oil in every six months to buy humanitarian supplies as
well as to pay reparations stemming from the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed stringent sanctions on Iraq in 1990 following
its invasion of Kuwait. Iraq says that as many as 1.3 million Iraqi
civilians have died as a direct result of the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Hizbul Rules out Talks under Indian Constitutional Framework </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Hizbul Mujahideen, the biggest
military group challenging the Indian rule in the disputed area of
Kashmir, Sunday rejected the Indian government's offer to hold
dialogue with Kashmiri groups under the framework of Indian
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan-based Chief of Hizbul Mujahideen, Syed Salahuddin,
said in a statement that India has again demonstrated its "
traditional, double standards and deceptive tactics."
</P>
<P>
He said that his group has already made it clear that the 53-
year old Kashmir dispute could be settled only through tripartite
talks that include Kashmiris, India ad Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said Hizbul Mujahideen has created conducive atmosphere to
India for talks by announcing unilateral cease-fire recently.
</P>
<P>
"Beginning of the talks process will be impossible unless India
categorically announce to hold unconditional talks. Hizbul
Mujahideen would have no other option but to review its cease-fire
declaration if India does not stop its traditional stubbornness,"
Salahuddin said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Pakistan chapter of Hizbul Mujahideen
dissociated itself from the unilateral ceasefire decision by the
group's Kashmiri leaders and vowed to continue jehad (holy war)
against India.
</P>
<P>
The Central Advisory Council of Pakistan chapter of Hizbul
Mujahideen held an emergency meeting here and unanimously
announced its dissociation with the ceasefire offer, reported the
News Network International agency.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued at the conclusion of the meeting said that
Hizbul Mujahideen has played a central role in the eleven-year old
jehad and has sacrificed 13,000 lives during this period.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating its determination to continue fighting against the
Indian rule over the three-fifths of Kashmir, the Pakistan chapter
of Hizbul Mujahideen urged the central leadership to "reactivate
the role of jehad" by withdrawing the unilateral ceasefire
announcement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Not a Fair Peace Broker: UAE Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates'
newspapers Sunday lashed out at the United States for its bias
toward Israel during the recent three-way Camp David summit between
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Plestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. is no longer the fair sponsor and broker of the Middle
East peace process," the Sharjah-based Al Khaleej said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. position has been very clear since the doomed Geneva
summit between U.S. President Bill Clinton and late Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad, commented the paper, adding Clinton
betrayed his bias toward Israel by holding Assad responsible for
the failure of the summit because Assad did not bow to pressure and
stuck instead to Syria's right to recover its occupied land.
</P>
<P>
The scenario was replayed with the Palestinians after the
collapse of the Camp David summit when Clinton and U.S. officials
brandished sword of sanctions on the Palestinians and threatened to
move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem if they declare
their independent state, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper also lampooned Clinton, saying he is courting the
American Jews to win their votes for his deputy Al Gore in the
presidential elections or for his wife Hillary Rodham Clinton who
is running for the Senate, at the expense of the Arabs and their
legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Dubai-based Al Bayan said Clinton's threats to
review relations with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat if he went
ahead with his plan to declare a Palestinian state, should not pass
without a firm and immediate Arab and Muslim reaction to bring
Clinton back to reason.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's threats aimed not only at backing election campaigns
of Al Gore and Hillary but also at helping Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak to find a way out of his internal political crisis, the
paper added.
</P>
<P>
The paper also called for holding an immediate Arab summit
through which Arabs can foil schemes targeting Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Buy a Submarine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will buy its first
submarine under the Eighth Malaysia Plan (2001-2005), Defense
Minister Najib Tun Razak said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The government has agreed in principle to the purchase proposal
to enhance the country's sea defense capability, the minister told
reporters after a function here.
</P>
<P>
But he said the government had not decided whether to buy a new
submarine or a used one.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to buy a submarine was made several years ago but
had to be shelved because of problems like financial constraints,
he said, adding the purchase of the submarine was planned in
tandem with the development of the Royal Malaysian Navy's (RMN)
new base in Teluk Sepanggar, Sabah, east Malaysia, under the
Eighth Malaysia Plan.
</P>
<P>
He said that with a submarine, the RMN would have high capacity
to monitor the nation's waters and be able to cover a wider area.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry would refer the purchase to the government
for a final decision.
</P>
<P>
The RMN has no problem getting the crew to operate the
submarine because training was given several years ago, the
minister said.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Mossad Issues Spy Recruitment Advertisement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Israel's secret intelligence
service Mossad is advertising for new spies, a move aimed to
counteract the country's flourishing hi-tech business' overpowering
attraction to the young talents.
</P>
<P>
The recruitment campaign, which includes advertisements on major
media, was initiated and approved by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, the Jerusalem Post daily on Sunday quoted security officials
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mossad, which is responsible for gathering intelligence outside
Israel and conducting "special operations" abroad, is regarded as
one of the most successful and efficient intelligence agencies in
the world.
</P>
<P>
However, the service is facing structural reorganization to
accustom itself to a more democratic and open society.
</P>
<P>
In the past, many young Israeli talents considered it a supreme
honor to join the mysterious Mossad. However, the hi-tech sector
today has become more and more attractive and has magnetized many
qualified youths.
</P>
<P>
Mossad's United States and British counterparts, the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Military Intelligence-5 (MI-5), have
been openly advertising for recruits since the mid-1990s.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Gives up Portfolio for Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Minister of Regional
Cooperation Shimon Peres resigned from the cabinet on Sunday so as
to stand as a candidate for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
The move was intended to overcome a legal complication that has
arisen in his race for the position of the first citizen.
</P>
<P>
Under the Israeli law, it takes 48 hours for a minister's
resignation to take effect.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, if Peres, the presidential candidate from the ruling
Labor Party, does not resign by Sunday, a swear-in ceremony can not
be held on August 1 as planned if he wins in the Knesset
(parliament) vote Monday, because legally he will still be holding
the minister's portfolio.
</P>
<P>
The 120-member Knesset will conduct secret balloting on Monday
to elect the country's eighth president. The candidate who pockets
at least 61 votes will become the president.
</P>
<P>
Peres, a former prime minister and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate,
is competing with Moshe Katsav from the opposition Likud Party and
is considered to have edge over his opponent.
</P>
<P>
However, how the 17 Knesset members of the ultra-Orthodox Shas
party will cast their votes is still seen as vital to the final
outcome of the race.
</P>
<P>
Council of Torah Sages, Shas' decision-making body, is to meet
on Sunday to decide how its deputies should cast their votes in the
secret balloting.
</P>
<P>
The decision is expected either to be a unanimous endorsement of
one of the two candidates or to grant its legislators freedom to
vote in line with their own choice.

<HEADLINE> Philippine House Speaker Wants Mindanaoans to Decide E-Powers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine House Speaker Manuel
Villar said Sunday that it is up to Mindanaoans to decide on
whether to grant emergency powers to President Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Villar said members of the House of Representatives from the
southern island of Mindanao will consult their constituents to
gauge their sentiments on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The decision of Mindanaoans will be the greatest factor in
determining the outcome of deliberations on the emergency powers
bill submitted by the government, he said, noting that they are
the ones who will be directly affected.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada has been seeking special economic powers from
the Congress to fast-track rehabilitation and development projects
in the once-neglected southern island.
</P>
<P>
But some lawmakers and businessmen voiced their opposition,
arguing the president could use the powers already available to
him to do the job, and that such measures would lower business
confidence and threaten away much-needed investment.
</P>
<P>
Villar promised that should the House approve the bill, the
emergency powers will be only economic in nature, applied only to
Mindanao and will have a limited time frame.
</P>
<P>
Oversight functions must also be granted to prevent possible
abuse of the powers, he added.
</P>
<P>
The speaker earlier suggested the government may also tap House
measures already passed that prevent lower courts from issuing
temporary restraining orders on government projects as well as a
measure that expedites the expropriation process on privately-
owned lands to fast-track the development of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He said the House will extend its support to this endeavor as
it is what the people of Mindanao want. "It's about time we
actualize the dream to make Mindanao a food basket and growth
center, after decades of neglect," he said.

SEOUL -- Delegates of South Korea and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) began their first-round of meeting here
Sunday morning to discuss follow-up measures to the June 15 South-
North Joint Declaration, economic cooperation and social and
cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
It is the first ministerial meeting between the South and the
North since May 1992.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean delegation is headed by Unification Minister
Park Jae-kyu and the chief DPRK negotiator is Senior Cabinet
Counselor Jon Kum Jin.
</P>
<P>
The June 15 South-North Joint Declaration was signed by South
Korean President Kim Dae-jung and DPRK leader Kim Jong Il in
Pyongyang in June in the first-ever inter-Korean summit in more
than 50 years. (Inter-Korean Ministerial Meeting)

<P>
PYONGYANG -- As a result of the government's active diplomatic
policy and multilateral diplomatic initiatives in recent months,
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)is seen making new
headway in developing its relations with neighboring states, the
West and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Tensions on the Korean peninsula have obviously eased and
relations between the north and south sides have improved
following a landmark summit here in June between DPRK leader Kim
Jong Il and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and the signing of
the North-South Joint Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The first-ever inter-Korean summit after a 55-year division of
the peninsula marked a turning point in the relations between the
two sides. Such improvement will benefit not only the peace and
reunification of the Korean peninsula but also the peace and
stability of northeastern Asia and the world at large, while
creating important opportunities for the DPRK to improve its ties
with countries all over the world. (DPRK-Diplomacy)

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is bracing for the
possibility that a no-confidence vote in the Knesset (parliament)
Monday can topple his government, unless he can persuade Foreign
Minister David Levy Sunday not to quit, an aide to Barak said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Levy has said he will resign over the concessions Barak offered
to the Palestinians at the Camp David summit. If Levy quits, he
might support a Likud no-confidence motion over the summit.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Levy are to meet after the weekly cabinet meeting
Sunday. According to an aide of Levy's, Levy can be persuaded to
remain in the government if Barak agrees to try to negotiate a
joint coalition with the Likud, or if Barak pledges not to go
beyond Levy's "red lines" in future negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday granted a long
interview to Israel's Channel One Television. During the broadcast,
Clinton praised positions adopted by Barak during the Camp David
summit, and promised that he will continue his efforts aimed at
attaining an Israeli-Palestinian agreement before the mid-September
target date.
</P>
<P>
Showing strong support for the Israeli prime minister, Clinton
promised that if an agreement is forged, he will help get it
approved by the Israeli public in a referendum. He did not rule out
the possibility of his visit to Israel and Palestinian self-rule
areas.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he will be willing to sponsor a second Israeli-
Palestinian summit only if it is certain that an agreement will
come out of it.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Shas' policy-making Council of Torah Sages is to meet Sunday
to decide whether to endorse either One Israel's Shimon Peres or
Likud's Moshe Katsav in Monday morning's presidential election in
the Knesset, or to grant its legislators freedom to vote as they
wish in the secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
Likud candidate Katsav met with Shas' spiritual leader Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef for more than an hour Friday at the latter's home in
Jerusalem, in a last-ditch effort to convince the Shas leader to
endorse him.
</P>
<P>
From the start of the campaign, Katsav, a former deputy premier,
has focused on winning the support of Shas, saying its 17 Knesset
members will be the key to his victory.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- After a number of delays, United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) started deployments on Friday along the
international border between Israel and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with an understanding reached between the two
states, the U.N. contingent will be deployed on the Lebanese side
of the border at six sensitive points, including a post southeast
of Metulla, which has been the scene of almost daily rock-throwing
demonstrations by Lebanese and Palestinian protesters.
</P>
<P>
Some 5,000 UNIFIL troops are being deployed at this initial
stage. All told, 8,000 U.N. peacemakers are expected to be deployed
to keep the peace on the Israeli-Lebanese border.

<HEADLINE> Barak Faces Tough Political Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
is bracing for the possibility that a no-confidence vote in the
Knesset (parliament) on Monday could topple his government as
Foreign Minister David Levy threatened to quit.
</P>
<P>
Levy said Thursday that he will resign from the government over
the "concessions" Barak offered to the Palestinians at the Camp
David summit. If Levy quits, he might support a no-confidence
motion tabled against Barak by the opposition Likud party.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Levy are to meet again on Sunday after the weekly
cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to a Levy aide, Levy can be persuaded to remain in the
government if Barak agrees to try to negotiate a joint coalition
with the Likud, or if Barak pledges not to go beyond Levy's "red
lines" in future negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Though Levy has not publicly detailed the concessions that so
angered him, he has made it clear that the Jerusalem issue troubles
him the most.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Barak's One Israel alliance believe that it is hard
for Levy to quit right now, due to the fact that if he brings down
the government by voting against Barak in the no-confidence motion,
he will be barred by law from joining the Likud or any other
political party ahead of the next elections.
</P>
<P>
And instead, Levy might have to run at the head of an
independent party, which could signal the end of his political
career.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe Monday's no-confidence vote is
crucial for Barak. If Levy abstains or stays away from the vote, he
will not hurt the government, because Barak will not be toppled
unless 61 members, an absolute majority of the 120-member Knesset,
support the motion.
</P>
<P>
But Barak's aides are worried that in the event that Shimon
Peres is elected president on Monday ahead of the no-confidence
voting, his Knesset seat will be given to Levy's ally in One
Israel, Mordechai Mishani of Levy's Gesher (bridge) party, who
could vote against the government.

Tianjin Unicom has seen a rapid growth since last year. Its
market share is now about 20 percent of the city's total, five
percentage points higher than the average level of all the China
Unicom branches.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom was set up in 1994 as a competitor to the
previously sole operator-- China Telecom. Tianjin was among the
first cities to have Unicom branches.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Unicom will invest another 900 million yuan (about 10.8
million U.S. dollars) this year to raise its switchboard capacity
and database content.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Military Boosts Contacts with Foreign Counterparts (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the new leader in the Taiwan region was elected in May,
Chinese military leaders on separate occasions reaffirmed the
stance of the Chinese government on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
They vowed that Chinese People's Liberation Army has the
confidence, determination, and ability to safeguard China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Top Chinese army leaders have also visited European, Latin
American and African countries including Italy, Spain, Portugal,
Britain, Germany, Argentina, Chile, Ukraine and Egypt in the first
half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Military observers here pointed out that the reinforcement of
the mutually-trusting and cooperative military relations between
China and European and Third World countries will promote the
multi-polarity process.
</P>
<P>
Just as Chinese President Jiang Zemin said at the Conference on
Disarmament in Geneva in March 1999, "The old security concept
based on military alliances and build-up of armaments will not
help ensure global security, still less will it lead to a lasting
world peace.
</P>
<P>
This, then, requires the cultivation of a new security concept
that meets the needs of the times and calls for vigorous efforts
to explore new ways to safeguard peace and security.
</P>
<P>
We believe that the core of such a new concept of security
should be mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that the flexible and pragmatic military contacts
between Chinese and foreign armed forces, which also contributed
to the country's diplomacy, have played a positive role in
promoting military cooperation, peace and development and
maintaining regional stability.

<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese armed forces have
continued to boost mutual trust and cooperation with their
counterparts in both developed and developing countries this year.
</P>
<P>
Military contact with foreign countries -- an important element
of the country's diplomacy -- has scored remarkable achievements
in the past seven months.
</P>
<P>
China and its largest neighbor Russia have maintained all-round
and multi-level friendly relations in the military field.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and Russian heads of state signed the Beijing
Declaration and a joint statement on the anti-ballistic missile
issue during Russian President Vladimir Putin's first state visit
here this month, and the defense ministers of the two countries
have met three times within six months.
</P>
<P>
"Development of the Sino-Russian strategic and cooperative
partnership is undoubtedly conducive to the global strategic
balance," said a senior expert on international relations in the
Chinese Military Science Academy.
</P>
<P>
China and central Asian countries have also promoted the
mutually-trusting and friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
Defense ministers of China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Kyrgyzstan and
Tajikistan gathered for the first time in Astana, the capital of
Kazakhstan, this March, and came to agreement on a wide range of
issues including military cooperation, cracking down on
transnational separatists, religious extremists and international
terrorism.

In developments with countries in northeast and south Asia, top
military leaders of China and the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea met each other in June; the Chinese defense minister visited
the Republic of Korea for the first time; the chief of the general
staff of the Chinese army and the chairman of the Japanese council
of joint chiefs exchanged visits. Sino-Indian military relations
have been restored with a China visit by a delegation of the
Indian Defense Institute.
</P>
<P>
"The pragmatic diplomacy of the Chinese military plays a
constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability on the
Korean peninsula and South Asia," the expert said.
</P>
<P>
The military relationship between China and the United States
was suspended ever since May 8, 1999, when U.S.-led NATO bombed
the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia. Sino-U.S. defense talks were
held in Washington this March.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Chinese and U.S. military delegations have
exchanged more visits. U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen also
recently visited China.
</P>
<P>
"China and the U.S. have shared common interest and
responsibility in maintaining world peace and development, and the
resumption of Sino-U.S. military relations will play a positive
role in the security and stability of the region and the world,"
said the military science academy expert.
</P>
<P>
"Sino-U.S. military relations have been developed within the
framework of the whole Chinese foreign policy. Only if the U.S.
earnestly observes the joint communiques between the two countries
and honors all its commitments on the Taiwan issue, the most
important and sensitive one in the bilateral ties, can Sino-U.S.
relations develop in a healthy way," she stressed.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Makes New Headway in Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- As a result of the government's
active diplomatic policy and multilateral diplomatic initiatives
in recent months, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
is seen making new headway in developing its relations with
neighboring states, the West and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Tensions on the Korean peninsula have obviously eased and
relations between the north and south sides have improved
following a landmark summit here in June between DPRK leader Kim
Jong Il and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and the signing of
the North-South Joint Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The first-ever inter-Korean summit after a 55-year division of
the peninsula marked a turning point in the relations between the
two sides. Such improvement will benefit not only the peace and
reunification of the Korean peninsula but also the peace and
stability of northeastern Asia and the world at large, while
creating important opportunities for the DPRK to improve its ties
with countries all over the world.
</P>
<P>
The traditional friendly cooperative relations between the DPRK
and China have enjoyed further consolidation and progress. Kim
Jong Il, chairman of the DPRK National Defense Commission, visited
China in May. Choosing China as his first foreign destination, Kim
made it clear that the DPRK attaches great importance to further
promoting its traditional ties with China. Kim and Chinese leaders
exchanged views on bilateral and international issues and reached
agreement on major topics.
</P>
<P>
DPRK-U.S. relations have also experienced improvement. After
last September's Berlin meeting, the DPRK promised to suspend its
nuclear tests, while the U.S. announced to lift part of its
sanctions against the DPRK. The two sides met again in March and
May to continue their discussions on some outstanding problems. On
July 15, the U.S. government pledged a food aid of 50,000 tons of
wheat to the DPRK, followed by a partial lift of the economic
sanctions against the country.
</P>
<P>
This month, DPRK Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright held in Bangkok the first
ministerial meeting between the two countries in more than half a
century, during which they exchanged views on further improving
bilateral relations and the situation on the Korean peninsula. Now
the two sides are preparing for a high-level meeting in Washington.
Frequent contacts and dialogues between the two countries will
help enhance mutual understanding, bilateral relations and create
beneficial conditions for the DPRK to expand diplomatic space and
gain international investment and aid.
</P>
<P>
A thaw has begun in DPRK-Japan relations. Last December, the
DPRK invited Former Japanese Prime Minister Murayama Tomiichia
with a delegation of Japanese political parties to Pyongyang,
during which agreement was reached on reopening normalization
negotiations and Japan's resumption of food aid to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Soon after that, Japan announced lift of sanctions against the
DPRK.
</P>
<P>
In the beginning of April, the two countries resumed
normalization talks, which had been stalled for eight years, to
discuss issues left over by history and matters they were
concerned about, reaching consensus in some respects.
</P>
<P>
Just a few days ago, the foreign ministers of the two neighbors
issued a joint statement following their first meeting in 52 years
in Bangkok, Thailand. They agreed to make efforts to establish
good neighborly relations, settle existing problems in bilateral
ties, and enhance understanding, friendship and exchanges in
various areas.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to start a new round of normalization talks in
Tokyo August 21-26.
</P>
<P>
Responding to international changes, Pyongyang set off to mend
fences with Russia. The two sides concluded a treaty on
friendship, good neighborliness and cooperation in February. On
July 19, Putin visited the DPRK, the first trip by a Russian
president. During the visit, leaders of the two countries reached
agreement on a spate of important issues and signed a joint
declaration. Both countries deemed the visit epoch-making and a
new phase in the annals of their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Russia announced that DPRK leader Kim Jong Il
will visit Russia.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere around the world, the DPRK has established or
restored official relations with Italy, Australia and the
Philippines so far this year, and have been making contacts with
the United Kingdom, Germany, New Zealand, France, Canada and
Myanmar over building diplomatic ties and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the DPRK has been positively seeking memberships and
involvement in regional and international organizations in order
to raise its international status. As a major achievement, the
DPRK has become a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), a
multilateral body concerned with regional security.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the DPRK's multilateral diplomatic
endeavors would promote its contacts and cooperation with the rest
of the international community, further ease the tensions on the
Korean peninsula, benefit economic and trade cooperation and gain
more international aid, which would after all bring about a good
international environment for restoring and developing its
domestic economy.

<HEADLINE> Tszyu Beat Cesar Chavez to Retain WBC Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Kostya Tszyu easily retained
his World Boxing Council super lightweight title Saturday night
with a sixth-round technical knockout of Julio Cesar Chavez in
Phoenix, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old Chavez was no match for the 30-year-old
champion in the sixth round, as Tszyu knocked Chavez down with a
right hand. Chavez, a six-time world champion in four weight
classes, staggered to his feet and fought on.
</P>
<P>
But a moment later, Tszyu had him pinned to the ropes,
pounding Chavez repeatedly when referee Bobby Ferrara stopped the
fight.
</P>
<P>
The crowd booed loudly and threw objects at the ring but it
was obvious Chavez was finished.
</P>
<P>
Each fighter earned dlrs 1.25 million.
</P>
<P>
Tszyu, who was born in Russia and then moved to Australia
eight years ago, improved to 25-1-1 with 21 knockouts. Chavez is
103-5-2,but has lost two of his last three fights.
</P>
<P>
In the main undercard fight, Hector Camacho Jr., 21, won a
technical decision over South Africa's Philip Holiday. Referee
Tony Weeks stopped the fight in the sixth round when Camacho
elbowed Holiday, cutting him above the right eye. Weeks ruled the
elbow was accidental and Camacho won the decision because he was
ahead on the judges' cards.
</P>
<P>
Camacho improved to 29-0 with 17 knockouts.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Passenger Plane Crash Due to Bad Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Preliminary investigation
indicated that bad weather was the main cause for the plane crash
that happened on Thursday in western Nepal and all the 25 people
on board are confirmed to be killed, a report said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft could have entered a cloud patch and the pilot
could not see very far, said The Kathmandu Post, an English daily.
</P>
<P>
According to technicians, the pilot must have "descended early",
being too confident that the plane had already crossed the hill it
hit, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
"Technicians say that the aircraft could have easily entered
the Terai plain if only it was 10 feet higher," Minister for
Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation Tarani Chataut was quoted as
saying. Chataut is at the crash site to coordinate the rescue
operations.
</P>
<P>
The twin otter aircraft had chopped off a pine tree and banged
into a second one on a hill about 4,300 feet high.
</P>
<P>
The plane engine was found some 100 meters down on a cliff,
while all the bodies were found intact and close to the crash site,
said a rescue worker.
</P>
<P>
Some locals who witnessed the crash said all the passengers
were already dead when they reached the scene minutes after the
crash.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated aircraft of the Royal Nepal Airlines had taken
off at 10:11 a.m. from Bajhang in far-western Nepal and crashed at
about 10:30, a few seconds before landing in Dhangadi, about 100
km from Bajhang.
</P>
<P>
The 25 people on board included 22 passengers and three crew
members.
</P>
<P>
The airlines authority said an investigation team has been
formed to find out more details about the crash cause.

some 214 kilometers northeast to Dhaka, at a cost of 110 million
taka (2.1 million U.S. dollars), The Financial Express reported
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The park, to be surrounded by waterfalls of Madhabkunda and
Muraichhara hills, aims at protecting the bio-diversity and
checking the degradation of the environment in the district.
</P>
<P>
The project, titled "Madhabkunda-Muraichhara Eco-Park", is also
expected to protect and preserve rare plant species and orchids,
to set up a sanctuary for wildlife and to develop eco-tourism.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious project has been taken up after an expert team
following an extensive feasibility study declared Madhabkunda-
Muraichhara as vulnerable areas.
</P>
<P>
The Environment and Forest Minister visited the area last year
and decided to set up the park.
</P>
<P>
According to competent sources, physical works of the project
will start soon after the floating of tender.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Appoints New Jaffna Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Major General Anton Wijendra has
been appointed as the new commander in Sri Lanka's troubled
northern Jaffna peninsula in the next few days, army sources said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He took over the command from Major General Sarath Fonseka who
was sent to Jaffna after Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
rebels captured the strategic Elephant Pass, a narrow causeway
linking the Jaffna peninsula with the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Major General Wijendra returned to the island earlier this
month after completing a special one year training at Pakistan's
Military Academy. The new Jaffna Commander, who joined the Sri
Lankan army in 1970, is a battle hardened officer who was the
Deputy General Officer commanding the 52nd Division to capture
Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
Military sources believe that the new commander will face a
tough job as the forces have received reports of regrouping by the
LTTE rebels to capture its former stronghold of Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE failed to capture the Jaffna peninsula in May this
year after a string of victories against the Sri Lankan forces.
President Kumaratunga appealed for help from friendly countries at
the time and the government was able to secure modern arms to halt
the LTTE offensive.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels are fighting for a separate state for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.

WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Elise Ray beat the twice
national champion Kristen Maloney and a group of 1996 Olympians to
take the women's individual all-around title at the U.S.
Gymnastics Championships in St. Louis Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Together with Vanessa Atler and Jamie Dantzscher, the new
generation of the U.S. women gymnasts proved they're up to the
task of bringing home a medal from Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Ray ended Maloney's two-year run as national champion, narrowly
winning with 76.987 points, just 0.275 points ahead of Maloney,
who finished with 76.712 points. Dantzscher was third with 75.700,
and Atler was fourth with 75.412.
</P>
<P>
Shannon Miller and Jaycie Phelps skipped the all-around finals
with injuries and will petition for a spot at next month's Olympic
trials.
</P>
<P>
Among the 1996 Olympians, Amy Chow had the best finish on the
sixth spot with 75.175 points, while Dominique Moceanu in eighth
with 73.424 and Dominique Dawes in ninth with 73.412.
</P>
<P>
The top 12 finishers at the nationals will advance to next
month's Olympic trials where top three scorers, together with the
performance at the nationals, will secure their Olympic tickets,
with the other three to be picked up by Bela Karolyi and his three-
member committee.
</P>
<P>
Moceanu, competing on a sprained left ankle, was solid but not
spectacular, scoring one 8.9 and not earning anything higher than
a 9.425.
</P>
<P>
Dawes, who only began training seriously in April, moved her
from 13th place to ninth after her struggles on the beam and vault.
</P>
<P>
Chow took hops on each of her vaults and almost fell off the
balance beam, with her biggest disaster on the uneven bars with a
9.125, where she won her individual silver medal at the Atlanta
Olympics.

<HEADLINE> China's Silk Industry Shows Signs of Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Exports of the silk industry in
China expanded this year, but the industry needs to improve its
image on the world market, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
From January to June, silk exports increased by 11 percent from
the same period last year, said Fan Xun, secretary-general of the
China National Silk Association, a national semi-official
organization engaged in co-ordinating Chinese companies' silk
trading.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the strong growth in silk exports, something
rarely seen during the past four years, to Chinese companies'
efforts to sell more primary silk products including raw silk,
mulberry silk, tussah silk and yarn, on the world market.
</P>
<P>
During the first six months of this year, the export value of
primary (or unfinished) silk products increased by approximately
60 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Fan predicated the growth trend would continue throughout this
year.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the poor administration of silk trading and
pricing among Chinese companies and silk producers on the domestic
market could weigh down this optimistic prediction.
</P>
<P>
He urged manufacturers to upgrade their reeling machines,
undertake innovations in techniques, designs and colors.
</P>
<P>
Fan said State manufacturers and firms should become more
competitive, engage in more research and development, such as
developing fabric blends, to adjust product structures and enhance
their market awareness.

<HEADLINE> ICBC's Non-Performing Rate Lowest In History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China's largest commercial bank's
credit assets quality improved markedly during the first six
months of this year, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The use of stringent management and loan procedures led to the
improvement, said President Jiang Jianqing of the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China (ICBC).
</P>
<P>
During the first six months this year, renminbi loans granted
by ICBC, the country's largest State-owned commercial bank,
increased by a record 165.6 billion yuan (19.95 billion US dollars)
, up 71.4 billion yuan (8.6 billion US dollars) from last year's
period.
</P>
<P>
"The quality of the new loans was quite good with only 0.66
percent of them non-performing, the lowest in ICBC's history,"
said Jiang at the bank's mid year national conference.
</P>
<P>
Most new loans have been in profitable categories and were made
to high quality clients. In the consumer credit category, the non-
performing loan ratio, although unstated, was reported to be
acceptably low. Consumer loans accounted for 21.8 percent of all
new loans approved during the first half of this year, a 6-
percentage-point increase over last year period.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Producers Bite into Fruit Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China imported 1.9 million tons of
fruit with a value of more than 600 million US dollars last year,
which was 172 percent and 134.9 percent higher than in 1998,
according to today's "China Daily."
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the General Administration of Customs show that
domestic fruit production has not fared so well. Last year, the
output of home-growth fruit was about 75 million tons. Apple and
pear output was tops in the world, but exports earned less than
400 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic market, especially in large coastal cities,
imported fruit has won a larger and growing market share in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
There are more than two million hectares of fruit fields in the
country and about 50 percent of last year's fruit are of medium
quality and 20 percent are of low quality. Only 30 percent of
Chinese-grown fruit meets quality standards of companies such as
the US's Sunkist, whose oranges entered China in April.
</P>
<P>
In the short term, imported fruit, which has an international
reputation, is certain to give vendors of home-grown fruit a run
for their money, the English newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Chinese growers can expect to lose some market share. But in
the long term, the domestic market for fruit will benefit.

BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China will establish a new
nationwide fiscal system within three years, according to Today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"Governments at all levels will be required to bring their
fiscal operations and budgets into line with the requirements of
the new fiscal system," Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng told a
national financial working conference last week.
</P>
<P>
The central government will stop allocating funds from its
budget to commercial activities at lower level that the government
says should be operated under the regulation of the market-
oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
It will also gradually reduce subsidies to loss-making State-
owned enterprises, reimbursements of taxes paid by enterprises,
funds allocated directly to State-owned enterprises and tax
incentives for enterprises in trouble.
</P>
<P>
The government will deposit all fiscal revenues into national
treasury accounts and will allocate funds for fiscal expenditures
directly from these accounts.
</P>
<P>
It will prohibit other governmental departments and local
authorities from holding fiscal revenue accounts, Xiang said.

<HEADLINE> Steel Makers Advised to Export More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government is urging
domestic steel enterprises to expand exports and to produce more
high-quality steel products, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The task is not a stop gap to alleviate an overall glut on the
domestic steel market, but involves a long-term strategy, said Pu
Haiqing, director of the State Administration of Metallurgical
Industry.
</P>
<P>
"Doing this is important for domestic steel enterprises if they
are to deal with global challenges from the country's expected
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO)," Pu said.
</P>
<P>
China will cut its tariffs on steel imports by 2.5 percent
within five years after the country's WTO entry.
</P>
<P>
Only by expanding exports can ineffective domestic enterprises
get tempered on the world steel market and survive increasingly
fierce global competition.
</P>
<P>
Pu called the domestic enterprises, especially the steel
conglomerates, to lose no time establishing global marketing
networks to claim a bigger market share on the world steel market.
</P>
<P>
Domestic enterprises made great achievements in exports during
the first half of the year, Pu said. According to administration
statistics, the domestic enterprises exported approximately 5.66
million tons of crude steel and finished products during the
period, an increase of more than 200 percent from the same period
of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The steel sector, which is struggling for a 10 percent decrease
in the total output, is targeting total steel exports of more than
10 million tons this year, compared with 4.5 million tons in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Delicate Gains Seen in Philippines' Hostage Crisis  By Pan Jiaxu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- With more captives released by the
Abu Sayyaf, the Philippine government hails the development in its
effort to address the Sulu hostage crisis, while critics blasted
the alleged ransom involvement.
</P>
<P>
Two journalists of the Philippine biggest TV network ABS-CBN
were released by the radical Muslim group Sunday afternoon, which
brings the total number of the released hostages up to 13.
</P>
<P>
Before this development, government negotiators have secured
the release of six Malaysians, an ailing German woman and a German
journalist. The rebels also freed a teenage captive and two
teachers kidnapped earlier from the nearby province of Basilan.
</P>
<P>
Following the latest progress, President Joseph Estrada, who is
in the United States for a ten-day official visit, was reported as
saying he is confident that more hostages will be released.
</P>
<P>
"We are making gains now," Estrada was quoted as saying in a
report issued here by the Office of Press Secretary.
</P>
<P>
"Remember that these people are terrorists and kidnappers. And
we have to take all the precautions in negotiating with these
people," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government chief negotiator Robert Aventajado voiced
confidence that the government will be able to secure the release
of the remaining hostages. But he failed to give a time frame.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said he was assured by Abu Sayyaf leader Galib
Andang alias Commander Robot that they will soon release more of
the remaining hostages.
</P>
<P>
The number of Abu Sayyaf captives have been trimmed to 17 -- 14
multi-national hostages abducted from the Malaysian resort island
of Sipadan in April and three French journalists captured earlier
this month in a rebel camp.
</P>
<P>
The 14 original captives kidnapped from Sipadan consist of
three Malaysians, two Germans, two French nationals, two Finns,
two South Africans, two Filipinos and a Lebanese woman.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado also announced that the 13 Christian preachers, who
went voluntarily early this month to the rebels' camp to pray for
the release of Sipadan hostages, were no longer considered
hostages.
</P>
<P>
He said he was assured by Andang that the preachers were at the
rebels' hideout to help resolve the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said no ransom was paid for the release of the ABS-
CBN journalists. But reports said the Abu Sayyaf earlier demanded
10 million pesos (250,000 U.S. dollars) for the freedom of the two
journalists.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country's leading daily newspaper, the Philippine
Star, also unveiled that the Abu Sayyaf bandits have raked in at
least 4 million dollars out of the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
Citing the reported ransom payment, some critics said the
situation arouses potential worries in their mind over the delay
of the final settlement of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Such worries increased as earlier reports said the Abu Sayyaf
kidnappers insist on one-million-dollar ransom for each of the
remaining Sipadan hostages.
</P>
<P>
House Rep. Heherson Alvarez, who is also secretary general of
the opposition party of the Lakas-NUCD, lashed at the government
for its allegedly giving in to Abu Sayyaf's ransom demands.
</P>
<P>
The piecemeal release of the hostages, he said, merely
indicated that the negotiations have been limited to pricing,
which he claimed has inflicted "social pain."
</P>
<P>
Another legislator Ralph Recto expressed concern that the
payment of huge ransoms to the Abu Sayyaf would encourage the
bandit group's kidnapping activity.
</P>
<P>
Recto, also chairman of the House economic affairs committee,
vowed to block any move by the Estrada administration to allocate
funds that will directly benefit Abu Sayyaf members.
</P>
<P>
He said that any proposed allocation in the budget meant for
the area occupied by the Abu Sayyaf is "nothing but ransom payment
through congressional insertion."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora argued
that the government has been sticked to its no-ransom policy. "We
always believe in a no-ransom policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the senior cabinet official said the government does
not discount the possibility of "third parties" negotiating with
the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
"But they do not have the government's approval," he stressed,
adding that any ransom payment in the event "are just worsening
the problem in the long run."
</P>
<P>
He also said the governments of the foreign hostages have
promised to support the Philippine government's policy. "They said
they will not do anything to violate the no-ransom policy," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
So far, all the governments of the released foreign hostages
have denied ransom payment. But they did rule out the possibility
that "other individuals or enterprises" handed over money without
the governments' knowledge.
</P>
<P>
On the development of the hostage crisis, analysts said both
the governments and bandits might have made gains in delicate ways,
with only the released and yet-to-be-released hostages left behind
as the real victims.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The remains of three rehabilitated
Albanian generals were reburied in a solemn service in Tirana
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The three generals -- former defense minister Admiral Beq Ir
Balluku, former chief of general staff Vice Admiral Petrit Dume,
and former political commissar Vice Admiral Hito Cako -- were
arrested and tried in secret in 1974 at the order of the then
Albanian top leader Enver Hoxha. In 1975 they were executed for "
treason."
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the Albanian High Court declared them innocent. But
their remains were not been found until earlier this month in
Franishti village in the southern Vlore region.
</P>
<P>
At the service, Defense Minister Ilir Gjoni rehabilitated the
reputations of the three generals and praised them as famous
military strategists in the history of the Albanian Army.

<HEADLINE> South Korea, Chinese Taipei in Final of Asian Women Junior Handball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Chinese Taipei moved
into the final of the sixth Asian Women Junior Handball
Championship Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The defending champions South Korea trounced Group A runners-up
Japan 33-14 in the first semifinal after leading the first half by
17-6.
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal, Chinese Taipei edged China 25-22 after
trailing 9-11 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
The final will take place on July 31.
</P>
<P>
According to The Daily Star's report Saturday, the technical
committee of the sixth Asian Women Junior Handball Championship
Friday declared China as winners against Japan by 19-18 in their
last Group B match held on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the technical committee after
examining the video recordings of the whole game following China's
written protest that the result of the match, which ended in a
controversial 19-19 draw, was manipulated by the match officials.
</P>
<P>
The technical committee explained that the lapse occurred due
to faulty score recording by the table scorer after an
intervention from the match supervisor and Executive Director of
Asian Handball Federation Abu al Lail.
</P>
<P>
Asaduzzaman Kohinoor, General Secretary of Bangladesh Handball
Federation and also Deputy Secretary General of the Organizing
Committee, said the match supervisor's act was completely illegal,
adding that under no circumstances, the match supervisor can
interfere in the scoring process.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy that justice has been done. The ruling, which was
done by examining video tapes, is unprecedented in handball
history," said Kohinoor.

<HEADLINE> Baumann Wins 5,000-meter at German Athletics Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Olympic champion Dieter
Baumann won the men's 5,000 meters at the German Athletics
Championships in Braunschweig Saturday, just a month after his
suspension for a positive doping test was lifted.
</P>
<P>
The champion of Barcelona Olympics was suspended in November
after testing positive for the banned anabolic steroid Nandrolone
and faced a potentially career-ending two-year ban.
</P>
<P>
Baumann alleged that the performance-enhancing substance had
been injected without his knowledge into his toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
State prosecutors said there was no evidence to back up his
claim, but that did not stop the German Athletics Federation (DLV)
controversially lifting Baumann's suspension, saying there was no
longer any pressing evidence against him.
</P>
<P>
Baumann, 35, has already beaten the Olympic 5,000 meters
standard and said he would quit the track after the Olympics to
concentrate on running marathons for the rest of his career.
</P>
<P>
In other events, sprinter Marc Blume won the men's 100 meters
in a German best time for the year of 10.19 seconds despite
running into a slight headwind.
</P>
<P>
Tim Lobinger won the pole vault with a jump of 5.85 meters and
will be joined in Sydney by Danny Ecker and Michael Stolle.

<HEADLINE> Former Lebanese President Returns to Live in Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Former Lebanese President Amin
Gemayel, who decided to return and live in his country after about
12 years of self exile in Paris, arrived at Beirut Airport Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But there was no official reception upon his arrival as
reportedly promised, and reporters, who had been advised not to
make interviews, were kept away from the airport.
</P>
<P>
Gemayel, the eldest son of Pierre Gemayel, founder of the
Christian Kataeb Party (Phalanges Libanaises), was born in 1942 in
the village of Bikfayya, northeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
He became a member of the National Assembly in 1969. In 1971, he
was elected a member of the Political Bureau of the Kataeb Party.
In 1982 he was elected president.
</P>
<P>
He left for Paris in 1988 after his presidential term ended and
threats were made against him.
</P>
<P>
Many people blamed Kataeb Party's close relationship with Israel
in the beginning of the 1980s for the Israeli invasion of Lebanon
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
He received an invitation form Syria to attend the ceremony
marking the end of the 40-day mourning period for former President
Hafez al-Assad, but was later told that Lebanese authority has not
approved it.
</P>
<P>
He had opposed the role of Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon in which it stationed some 35,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
Gemayel decided to return to Lebanon after Lebanon's political
giants -- President Emile Lahoud, Prime Minister Salim Hoss,
Speaker Nabih Berri -- and Justice Minister Joseph Shaoul vowed
that there was no legal problem for his coming back.
</P>
<P>
He had stayed in Beirut for three months in 1992 and left
quickly after receiving threats on his life.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Parliament Urged to Work for Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Petra Lanctz, acting resident
representative of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in
Zimbabwe, Monday urged the members of parliament in the country to
work for macro-economic stability and the improvement of people's
living standard.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of an induction program for members of
parliament sponsored by the UNDP, Lanctz said the demands on the
members of parliament were manifold and their actions and
decisions would be all important for the future of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Noting the present economic problems in Zimbabwe, Lanctz said:
"Nationally, most indicators of development progress are pointing
downwards. The ailing economy is affecting already low employment
opportunities. The budget deficit is inducing high inflation
hurting those that already hurt from lack of opportunity and
income."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she said that average life expectancy had been
reduced principally due to HIV/AIDS and health conditions were
worsening while financial inflows were drying up.
</P>
<P>
In addition to national challenges, she also mentioned the
challenges of globalization which have affected the role, power,
and governance of the traditional nation base.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the country was required to maintain security
and order and should create the macro-economic stability necessary
for revenue generation so as to finance public services and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Lanctz said the strength of the legislative system was measured
by its ability to express public opinion and to represent and
express the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
She urged the members of parliament to work for the improvement
of the people's lives through a spirit of consensus building and
constructive dialogue.
</P>
<P>
On Zimbabwe's land reform, she said it needs to be resolved in
a positive, urgent, orderly and non-violent manner.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Endorse Free Trade Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- An upcoming summit of the 14-
nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) are expected
to endorse a regional free trade pact, SADC acting executive
secretary Prega Ramsamy said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The summit is scheduled for August 6-7 in the Namibian capital
of Windhoek, according to the South African Press Association (
SAPA).
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted Ramsamy as saying in Windhoek that the free trade
protocol, already ratified by 10 member states, would phase out
tariff barriers for intra-SADC trade over the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
He said the free trade area, envisaged by the pact, will be
launched on September 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
"The main feature of the protocol is that the SADC free trade
area will be a reality in 2008," Ramsamy said.
</P>
<P>
The free trade area would be the "linchpin of regional
cooperation" among the group's 200 million people and would enable
SADC "to prepare ourselves to compete globally" , Ramsamy said.
</P>
<P>
"When we compete regionally we will improve standards, market
access and quality and this enables us to compete on the world
market," Ramsamy added.
</P>
<P>
The trade protocol envisages that 85 percent of SADC trade will
be liberalized by 2008, while the remaining 15 percent --
concerning "sensitive products" -- will be tariff-free by 2012.
</P>
<P>
Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and
Seychelles have yet to sign the trade protocol while Zambia has
signed it but not yet ratified it.
</P>
<P>
Ramsamy said that Angola was not in a position to sign the
protocol because of the civil war there, while the DRC and
Seychelles were new members of the grouping who were expected to
accede to the protocol "when they are ready".
</P>
<P>
Zambia had expressed concern about the trade protocol's
stipulations on the textile trade but these had now been resolved
and Lusaka was expected to ratify it soon, Ramsamy said.
</P>
<P>
Among member states which have ratified the protocol are
Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South
Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which will be preceded by a council of ministers
meeting on Friday and Saturday, is also expected to discuss the
restructuring of the SADC institutions and regional conflicts in
the DRC and Angola.

<HEADLINE> S. African Jobless Rate Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The official unemployment
rate in South Africa declined to 23.3 percent by October 1999 from
25.2 percent a year earlier, Statistics South Africa (SSA) said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decrease came after the rate had been on the increase for
three years, SSA chief director of research and development Ros
Hirschowitz told a media conference in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
According to SSA, the number of employed people rose from 9.3
million in 1998 to 10.4 million in 1999. The number of unemployed
stayed constant at about 3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the additional 1.1 million people employed were
working in the informal sector while one-third were employed in
the agricultural sector, as well as industries not covered by SSA'
s formal establishment surveys.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, our establishment statistics indicate that the number
of jobs in the formal sector declined from 5.2 million to 4.8
million between September 1996 and September 1999.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, informal sector employment rose from one
million to 1.9 million between 1996 and 1999," the SSA said.
</P>
<P>
The SSA conducts annual surveys among households throughout
the country. Unlike formal sector surveys, it records employment --
including self-employment -- in both the formal and informal
sectors.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Privatize Second Largest Sugar Mill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Plans to privatize the Chemelil
Sugar Company, the second largest sugar mill in southwestern Kenya,
are being finalized, Kenyan Agriculture Minister Chris Obure has
said.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard Monday quoted Obure as saying at the
weekend that according to the privatization plan, which was
initiated in 1992, the government would retain 33 percent of
shares in the company, down from the original 95.38 percent,
leaving 20 percent for farmers, 5 percent for workers and the
remainder for the public.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks at a ceremony marking the company
's 35th anniversary at Chemelil, 40 kilometers from Kisumu, the
capital of Nyanza Province.
</P>
<P>
He assured that the privatization process of the company will
be undertaken in a transparent manner and farmers in the region,
who have been raising money to buy their shares, will be all
involved.
</P>
<P>
Since the company was established in 1965, the factory's
crushing capacity has risen from 95 tons of cane an hour to 150
tons at present.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years the factory has milled 3.4 million
tons of cane, yielded over 300,000 tons of sugar and remitted 140
million shillings (about 1.87 million U.S. dollars) to the
Exchequer.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the company's sugar is sold locally and this year
it exported 2,086 tons of sugar to Europe, the first by a local
company in recent years.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations mission in the
war-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has failed and
African leaders must pressure DRC President Laurent Kabila upon
abiding by the Lusaka ceasefire agreement signed one year ago, a
senior U.N. official said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kamel Morjane, special representative of the U.N. Security
Council to the DRC, said that none of the conditions sought by U.N.
for the deployment of U.N. peace-keeping forces has been met.
</P>
<P>
"We have been trying since February to get U.N. forces there,"
said Morjane, adding: "We've asked the (Kabila) government to
respect the conditions we desire, that's serious observance of the
ceasefire, guaranteed security of U.N. troops and free movement of
U.N. soldiers and other personnel."
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, these conditions have never been there," the
envoy said.
</P>
<P>
"We consider as obstruction the decision taken by the
government not to allow the U.N. troops in some areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
One year ago all warring parties involved in the two-year war
in the DRC signed the ceasefire agreement in Lusaka. Since then,
African leaders have repeatedly called for a quick deployment of
the U.N. forces in the African country to police the peace process
there.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Infection Rate Drops Dramatically in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- HIV/AIDS infection rate in Uganda
has dropped dramatically, the latest official statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision daily reported Monday that the HIV/AIDS
infection rate has dropped by 50 percent since 1991, and among the
people aged between 15 and 19, there has been a 22.1 percentage
point decline in infection rate from 32.2 percent in 1991 to the
current 10.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Data from HIV infection sentinel surveillance sites continue
to show declining trends in major urban sentinel sites," said the
HIV/AIDS surveillance report released by the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
"In rural areas, the HIV infection rates have been persistently
lower than in urban areas, ranging from between 1.3 percent to 7.7
percent," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report bases its information on data garnered from Uganda's
45 districts and from programs and non-government-organizations
involved in HIV/AIDS prevention and counseling activities.
</P>
<P>
However, the statistics also indicate that the HIV/AIDS
infection rate among women is nearly twice as high as among men. "
Increasingly, women are getting more infected than men. The male
to female ratio is 1:1.7," said the report.
</P>
<P>
"In the younger age groups, especially in the age group of 15-
19 years, the male to female ratio is 1:6," the report said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Opposes Violence Against White Farmers: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Minister of Lands,
Agriculture and Resettlement Joseph Made said on Sunday night that
the government opposed violence and intimidation on the white
farmers, adding that the proposed stayaway of white farmers is
uncalled for.
</P>
<P>
Made said: "We have said anyone who feels threatened must go to
the police and consequently a number of farmers have been assisted.
"
</P>
<P>
He said the government was also aware that there were groups of
people harboring ulterior motives, masquerading as war veterans or
land hungry peasants.
</P>
<P>
"On the other land, some reports made by the farmers are found
not to be true. The government position, nevertheless, is that no
one should break the rules and laws of the country," he said,
adding that the issue of stayaways was not discussed at a meeting
held last Friday with the Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) and other
farmers' unions.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of a strike was never raised. We talked about
agriculture and productivity and it would be a big surprise if the
actions were to be carried out," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the white farmers called off a countrywide strike
that had been scheduled to start today, but said individual
members could join the three-day stayaway endorsed by Zimbabwe
Congress of Trade Union (ZCTU) beginning from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The CFU represents about 4,500 white commercial farmers.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan President Leads in Polling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The surveys, published shortly before the 6 p.m. (2200 GMT)
conclusion of the balloting, gave 34 percent of the vote to
Francisco Arias, a former ally of Chavez.
</P>
<P>
The polls published by El Nacional also showed that the key
post of Caracas mayor would go to a Chavez supporter, and that the
president's coalition could take at least 13 of the 23 state
governorships.
</P>
<P>
Chavez appeared likely to get a simple majority in the new 165-
seat National Assembly though opinion polls had forecast he would
fall short of a two-thirds majority. Despite record
unemployment and crime and a prolonged, deep economic crisis,
Chavez was expected to win a six-year mandate to lead the South
American nation.
</P>
<P>
According to the new constitution, the winner could stay in
power for up to 12 years.
</P>
<P>
 This election will choose the presidency, 165 members of a
new,unicameral legislature, 23 governors, 335 mayors, 219 members
of state legislatures, five representatives to the Latin American
Parliament, 12 representatives to the Andean Parliament and some
other local posts.

<P>
Nearly 12 million people in the No. 1 oil exporter in the
Western Hemisphere cast their ballots from 6 a.m. (1000 GMT)
peacefully at 8,400 polling stations.
