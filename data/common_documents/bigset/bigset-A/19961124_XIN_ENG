<HEADLINE> Pakistan Announces Incentives to Boost Textile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani Caretaker
government today announced withdrawal of customs, excise and
regulatory duties to revitalize the textile spinning sector.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, the federal Commerce
Minister, Zubair Khan, said these measures would help as "first
step " in overhauling the entire textile industry, particularly
the spinning sector.
</P>
<P>
Underlying these efforts, the Minister said these measures
would enhance availability of cotton and polyester fiber, and
improve value addition in textile industry, as well as provide
cheap and assured working capital.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the package, the Minister said that the existing 5
percent customs duty on cotton is being removed.
</P>
<P>
The existing regulatory duty of 15 percent on Polyester and 10
percent regulatory duty on viscose fiber and acrylic fiber have
been reduced to 5 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the 5 percent excise duty on polyester fiber has been
removed to help bring down the prices of polyester in the domestic
market."
</P>
<P>
The State Bank of Pakistan would ensure adequate availability
of credit to this sector, he added.
</P>
<P>
The package for textile industry was approved by the Economic
Coordination Committee (ECC) held here today.
</P>
<P>
The ECC meeting was chaired by the Adviser to the Caretaker
Prime Minister on Finance and Economic Affairs, Shahid Javed
Burki, and attended by concerned ministers and secretaries.

<HEADLINE> 1 Million Hurt in UK Hospital Accidents Every Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Hospital accidents in Britain
cost the National Health Service (NHS) at least 154 million pounds
(246.4 million U.S dollars) a year and injure an estimated 1
million people, the National Audit Office (NAO) has said.
</P>
<P>
In its report, the NAO said there are 450,000 reported
accidents every year. Non-reporting as well as different
definitions and recording procedures mean the real figure could be
more than 1 million.
</P>
<P>
Most injuries are caused by slips, trips and falls. The
greatest danger to staff is accidental stabbing by used hypodermic
needles -- which can pass on Aids or other potentially fatal
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
Nurses are suffering increasing numbers of attacks from
patients. These cause not only physical injury but psychological
damage, said the report by John Bourn, comptroller and auditor
general.
</P>
<P>
It called on hospital chief executives to give much higher
priority to accident prevention by "leading from the top." In
response to the study, the NHS executive has made plans to issue
further guidance to health service managers on compliance with
health and safety legislation.
</P>
<P>
The report said that hospitals are facing increasing claims for
compensation. There are expected to be 2,900 claims this year,
with an average payment of 10,000 pounds (16,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Individual compensation payments vary significantly, the
highest recorded payment being 345,000 pounds (552,000 dollars)
for a nurse who injured her back," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The immediate cost, including treatment, clearing up and
investigating the accidents, was 12 million pounds (19.2 million
dollars) but the longer-term cost, including time off work and
paying compensation, was expected to total at least 246.4 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Injuries can be reduced, said the report. A hospital that paid
700,000 pound (1120,000 dollar) compensation in one year cut
future payments and reduced days off through back injuries by 20
percent after introducing a staff training program on manual
handling.
</P>
<P>
Managers can reduce the risk of attacks on staff by providing
training on how to defuse potentially violent situations,
re-designing working areas and reviewing staffing arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Cutting accidents is in the hospitals' interest, said the
report. A trust with a wage bill of 30 million pounds (48 million
dollars) and a good claims record can expect a 30,000 pound
(48,000 dollar) insurance premium. One with a poor record may pay
90,000 pounds (144,000 dollars).

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Germany Signs Technical Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Germany
today signed a five-year agreement on promoting cooperation in
technical education between the two countries, Saudi Press Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which has been approved by the Saudi cabinet,
was signed by Saudi Finance and National Economy Minister Ibrahim
Al-Assaf and visiting German Secretary of State for Economic
Cooperation Wighard Hartil in the Saudi capital of Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The accord would allow the transfer of Germany's dual-track
system of technical education to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, the two officials held talks on
improvement and enlargement of the framework of Saudi-German
cooperation in the field of technical education and vocational
training.
</P>
<P>
Hartil arrived in Saudi Arabia Wednesday in his capacity as
chairman of the board of directors of German Agency for Technical
Cooperation, which has been operating in the kingdom for the last
three decades in cooperation with Saudi General Organization for
Technical Education and Vocational Training.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed an agreement on encouraging and
protecting investments in both countries last month in a bid to
increase investments in Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Food Devours Egyptian Family Budgets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptians, among the world's
highest bread consumers, spend more on food than any other needs
and set aside big sum for private lessons, according to a survey
published here today.
</P>
<P>
The study by the Central Auditing Agency, Ministry of
Agriculture and Ministry of Trade and Supply indicates that 50
percent or more of an average family income goes to food and less
than 4 percent to health care, regardless of its social status or
monthly income.
</P>
<P>
Fancy cookies, fowl, rice, tea and coffee altogether take up
50-75 percent of an Egyptian family's budget, while
internationally food consumption accounts for 30-40 percent of
families' annual income.
</P>
<P>
If the average annual income in Egypt is 4,705 Egyptian
pounds(1,384 U.S. dollars), 2,635 pounds will be spent on food
and cigarettes, which accounts for 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
While Egyptians are spending more to satisfy the stomach,
expenditures on other needs are relatively reduced: 323 pounds
for housing, 272 pounds for transportation and 170 pounds for
health care.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, another heavy load on many families' budgets
is money spent on private lessons, which amount to at least 1,003
pounds.
</P>
<P>
The research has attributed this high expenditure to the
deteriorating level of public education, unqualified teachers and
the shortage of teachers.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, transportation fees are growing for many Egyptians,
and money spent on housing has been stable and relatively small,
with the majority of Egyptians living in rented apartments with a
monthly fee of less than 27 pounds.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is still among the poor countries despite the ever
growing annual income of its citizens with the establishment of
the new economic order and implementation of the structural
adjustment programs, according to Medhat Hassanein, a professor
at the American University in Cairo.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified gunmen
killed three policemen and wounded six others, two of them
civilians, when they attacked a police station in southern Egypt
today, according to the Egyptian Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place early this morning as the assailants
opened fire sporadically from their car on the Deir Mawas police
station in Minya, southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
They fled the scene after trading fire with the police, an
official security source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Policemen Ahmed Ali Abdel Meneem and Samir Mazhar and Sentry
Zaghloul Abdel Aziz Maarouf were killed, according to the source.
Investigations began immediately.
</P>
<P>
No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but police said
they were believed to be Muslim militants seeking to overthrow the
government.
</P>
<P>
The militants have waged a violent campaign against the
government since 1992 in an attempt to install strict Islamic rule
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premier Meets Japanese Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that China attaches
importance to the position of Japan's new cabinet to improve and
develop relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remarks at a meeting with Japanese Foreign
Minister Yukihiko Ikeda in the Century Park Hotel in Manila this
evening.
</P>
<P>
Qian said China and Japan are not only close neighbors, but
also important countries in Asia and in the world as a whole,
adding that the stable development of Sino-Japanese relations
conforms to the interests of the two countries. "That is also a
summary of historical experience," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda said the new Japanese cabinet attaches great importance
to relations between Japan and China. He said Japanese-Chinese
relations are as important as Japanese-U.S. ties.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan will make efforts to develop and uphold the
friendly ties between Japan and China in accordance with the
principles of the Japanese-Chinese Joint Statement and Friendship
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
On issues left over from the history, Ikeda reiterated that
Japan's new cabinet will totally follow the position of Murayama's
cabinet admitting the history of aggression, saying that Japan
will deeply introspect to its history of aggression.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan is willing to envisage the future and develop
relations with China on the basis of adopting a correct attitude
toward the history.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Vice-Premier said whether or not to adopt a correct
attitude toward the history of aggression against China on the
part of the Japanese militarism is a matter concerning the
political foundation of Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
"We attach importance to the commitment made and stance taken
by Japan's new cabinet in this regard," said Qian.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Diaoyu island, Qian reaffirmed China's
consistent position, expressing the hope that the Japanese
government will take further measures to appropriately deal with
problems created by the Japanese side.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda said that the Japanese government does not support,
recognize and approve the move of some Japanese to install
so-called facilities on the island. The Japanese government
considers the move of these Japanese as intolerable and that it
has nothing to do with the position of the Japanese government, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the Japanese government will make earnest
effects to prevent the reoccurrence of such incidents.
</P>
<P>
On the Japanese-U.S. security treaty, Ikeda said that the
treaty is not directed against any third country and that there is
no intention to expand the defense scope. He said that both Japan
and the United States are willing to develop friendly relations
with China.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that in view of the history and reality, China has to
be concerned about the strengthening of military cooperation
between Japan and the United States. Japan should draw lessons
from the history and stick to the path of peaceful development,
Qian said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Help in Distributing Salvage Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today announced measures designed to encourage the distribution of
surplus food supplies to the poor.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address, delivered from Australia, Clinton
announced measures to ensure that needy Americans are given food
that otherwise would be thrown out.
</P>
<P>
Clinton taped the address while on a five-day visit to
Australia prior to his attendance at an Asian-Pacific economic
summit in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
One initiative requires all federal departments and agencies
"to actively work to promote food recovery and distribution," and
the second asks a guide book to be created for citizens who want to
help feed the poor.
</P>
<P>
"Our nation has always been a land of plenty," Clinton said in
his address. "But as blessed as we are, we must never forget that
there are those still struggling to take part in America's bounty."
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, all Americans must take responsibility to help our
fellow citizens in need," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the address, Clinton spoke highly of ongoing food recovery
efforts by private businesses and government agencies that this
summer alone collected several hundred tons of food from
restaurants, cafeterias and grocery stores that otherwise would
have been discarded.
</P>
<P>
But, Clinton said, enough food is still thrown out to feed 49
million people each year. "Recovering that surplus food can make a
real difference in the fight against hunger in America," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Burundian Military Strongman Confirms Massacre of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's military strongman
Pierre Buyoya today confirmed an accusation by the United Nations
that 298 Hutu refugees who returned home from Zaire were massacred
by the Burundian army on October 22.
</P>
<P>
"I am in the process of searching for the details," the Agence
France Presse (AFP) quoted Buyoya as telling a press conference in
Bujumbura, capital of Burundi, today.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the
United Nations reported Friday that 300 refugees were massacred in
a church in a village near Buganda, in the northwestern province
of Cibitoke.
</P>
<P>
These refugees fled the fighting between Zairean troops and
Banyamulenge Tutsi rebels in eastern Zaire last month.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that the United Nations did not specifically hold the
Tutsi-led Burundian army of being responsible for the massacre,
since the country has been in a state of civil war for four years.
</P>
<P>
Burundian Prime Minister Pascal-Firmin Ndimira, who was on a
visit in Sweden Friday, denied the report.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya, who came to power in a military coup in July, said last
week that some Hutu rebels were among the 145,000 Burundian refugees
in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rebels were trying to go to Tanzania through
Cibitoke to establish new military bases there.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya accused Tanzania of letting the rebels set up bases on
its territory, and said he had asked Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni to intervene over the alleged Tanzanian support to Hutu
rebels.

<HEADLINE> Moscow, Chechnya Sign Agreement on Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Chechnya's coalition government head Aslan
Maskhadov signed here today an interim treaty on bilateral
relations between the federal center and the local Chechen
republic.
</P>
<P>
The temporary agreement, which will remain in force until
presidential and parliamentary elections in Chechnya scheduled for
January 27, 1997, said that after the elections the sides will
have to sign a new agreement on special economic relations between
Moscow and Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Today's document called for restoration of air, railway and
motor transportation in Chechnya and for adoption of a document on
the customs service. A top priority task is the resolution of
social welfare problems -- the payment of pensions, allowances,
wages and compensations to the people affected by the war, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The document also contained a provision on "concerted actions
in the field of defense," provided both sides assume an obligation
"not to take any actions that may impair their security."
</P>
<P>
Before signing the document, Chernomyrdin and Maskhadov held
closed-door talks at a state residence outside Moscow. Russian
Security Council secretary Ivan Rybkin took part in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree
ordering a withdrawal of the Interior Ministry's 101st brigade and
the Defense Ministry's 205th motorized infantry brigade from
Chechnya before the upcoming elections there.
</P>
<P>
This move was designed to "create conditions" for all Chechen
citizens or enable them to "have an opportunity to make their
choice not at gun point," Yeltsin's Press Secretary Serei
Yastrzhembsky told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
The decree itself said that this step was taken in order to
"achieve accord and reconciliation in society, to ensure a further
peaceful settlement in the Chechen Republic, to demilitarize the
Chechen Republic and to create conditions for all citizens, who
have the right to participate in the formation of bodies of state
power in the Chechen republic, to exercise their right to vote."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on today's agreement, Chernomyrdin said that the
document "continues the consistent work that has been done to
settle the conflict in Chechnya." He considered his talks with
Maskhadov and the agreement as "considerable progress in the
resolution of issues concerning our (Moscow-Chechen) relations by
peaceful and civilized methods."
</P>
<P>
For his part, Maskhadov confirmed that "until to date, the
presence of the 101st and the 205th brigades in the republic was
the main problem in relations between Chechnya and the federal
center."
</P>
<P>
"We saw the president's decree today and took it with a feeling
of deep satisfaction," Maskhadov said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Belarus President Alexander
Lukashenko today accused parliament of breaking the compromise
agreement, reached with Russias mediation Friday, and declared his
withdrawal from the compromise, according to reports reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address to the nation, Lukashenko said the
results of the nationwide referendum on constitutional amendments
scheduled for Sunday will be of mandatory character.
</P>
<P>
If passed by the voters, the amendments will enlarge the power
of the head of state and extend his term in office. Belarus
parliament speaker Semyon Sharetsky said today that he did not
rule out the possibility that Lukashenko may dissolve the
opposition-dominated legislature if he wins at the coming
referendum.
</P>
<P>
The parliament ratified the compromise accord Friday in the
first reading but the debate soon heated up, and Lukashenko
stormed out at one point. After more than six hours of arguments,
it failed to give the deal a final approval and adjourned until
Tuesday without taking any decision.
</P>
<P>
The parliament failed to approve the agreement reportedly
because of its provisions that left the fate of the constitution
to be decided by the Constitutional Assembly. The opposition
deputies of the parliament insist that a new constitution be
adopted only by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Under Friday's agreement, a Constitutional Assembly
representing both sides -- the president and parliament -- will
work out an acceptable draft constitution, taking into account the
referendum results.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese FM Doubts Conference of Donor Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz expressed here today his doubt on the usefulness of
a conference of donor countries due in Washington on December 16
to discuss financial aids to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"I still does not feel much optimistic over results of the
consultative committee's conference, and my feeling is derived
not only from the form of the conference but also from its
contents," the foreign minister said in an interview with Free
Lebanon radio.
</P>
<P>
Washington has announced that it invited some 30 countries to
attend the conference, which is also called the "forum of
Lebanon's friends," in order to work out the ways and sizes of
financial assistances for Lebanon's multi-billion reconstruction
plans.
</P>
<P>
The consultative committee was set up under an interim
cease-fire arrangement auspiced by the United States and France,
which ended an Israeli blitz against Moslem guerrillas in south
Lebanon last April.
</P>
<P>
However, Boueiz said that he agreed to participate in the
conference since it is held especially for Lebanon's affairs.
</P>
<P>
"How can a conference be held on Lebanon by foreign ministers
of other countries without the presence of Lebanon's foreign
minister? For this reason I have taken the decision to
participate," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "regardless whether our opinion is pessimistic or
optimistic on results of the conference and on its timing, it is
our obligation to work hard."
</P>
<P>
Beirut said it would send a high-ranking delegation headed by
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, the mastermind of this country's
ambitious reconstruction scheme, to attend the Washington
conference.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz also called on the U.S. administration to reconsider a
10-year-old order banning U.S. citizens from traveling to
Lebanon, which Washington imposed following a series of
terrorist attacks against U.S. interests during Lebanon's civil
war.
</P>
<P>
"I say the American administration has realized that a delay
of lifting the ban is a big mistake which it is committing. If
Lebanon is paying a price for the ban, what the U.S. is paying
is even much bigger," he said.
</P>
<P>
Washington said that it was premature to lift the ban since
U.S. citizens were still imperiled in Lebanon, especially by
the existence of a military force of Lebanon's pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ban was politically motivated, but "it has
not made us to kneel down and has not affected our policies and
positions."

<HEADLINE> Int'l Meeting on Refugee Agrees on Priorities for Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Participants of an
international meeting here today agreed on priorities to help
reintegrate returning refugees in Africa's Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
"It is now time to act," said Don Boudria, Canadian minister
for international cooperation, at a press conference after the
one-day meeting held by donor countries and multilateral agencies
to ensure the swift, safe and peaceful reintegration of Rwandan
refugees into their communities.
</P>
<P>
Boudria, chairman of the closed-door meeting that Canada
sponsors, said that the needs of returning Rwandan refugees for
food, water, medicine and emergency shelter should be addressed.
Other general and medium-term priorities for action, on which the
participants have agreed, are the needs of women and children,
housing, justice, security, human resources development, and
agricultural rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda's Minister of Transport and Communications Charles
Murigande put forward at the meeting an emergency program for
resettlement and reintegration in the context of the present
massive return of refugees. The total cost of the program is
estimated to be nearly 740 million U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabweans have been urged to
be more actively involved in and redouble their commitment to the
control and prevention of the deadly AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Launching the National AIDS Week and World AIDS Day in Harare
today, President Robert Mugabe said the impact of AIDS is fast
eroding the national gains while the premature deaths of young
and middle-aged adults are adversely affecting the socio-economic
base.
</P>
<P>
The national AIDS week, which runs from November 24 to 30,
culminating in the World AIDS Day to be observed throughout the
world on December 1, carries the theme "one world one hope".
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, "I wish to emphasize that it is society's
responsibility to give hope, support and compassionate care to
many people who are living with HIV and AIDS."
</P>
<P>
He said the current AIDS education program in schools and
institutions of higher learning need to be expanded and its
effectiveness closely monitored, and in addition the Ministry of
Sport, Recreation and Culture should facilitate the strengthening
of cultural values which enhance the prevention and control of
HIV.
</P>
<P>
He added, "plans are underway to establish a national AIDS
council which besides formulating policy direction on AIDS, will
ensure that the AIDS prevention and control program is placed
high on the agenda for resource allocation."
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that an average of 500 "AIDS-related deaths
occurs each week, and to date the estimated total number of
full-blown AIDS cases in Zimbabwe stands at about 200,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
The readjustment of economic structure will be intensified to
gradually solve the problem of overlapping construction with a low
standard and with a tendency to seek all-embracing complexities on
both large and small scales, which has been a persistent problem
in China's economic development. The solution requires the
deepening of economic restructuring in an all-round way.
</P>
<P>
This asks for the discarding of the ideological concepts of
small-scale production, and the changing of the practice of
developing the economy by only increasing production. It is
imperative to first consider market needs, retain intensive
management, develop scale economy, and regroup and transform
existing enterprises, rather than a blind rush for new projects.
</P>
<P>
The enthusiastic cultivation of new economic growth outlets is
an important aspect and the inevitable outcome of readjusting and
optimizing existing structures. It is necessary to correctly
handle the relationship between basic and pillar industries. All
localities should give full consideration to the overall
arrangement and market potentials of the country, develop their
distinctive industries which are superior to other regions, and
actively open up new markets at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
A good macro-economic environment and standardized economic
order should be maintained, in adhering to a moderately-tight
financial and monetary control, and maintaining a rational growth
of investment and consumption.
</P>
<P>
Stricter control over new projects will be exercised to
optimize the investment structure, and work will continue to
readjust and control the range of price rises, and lower the
growth rate of prices.
</P>
<P>
It is important to standardize and rectify the economic order,
and to strengthen the supervision and management of the securities
market.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis will be placed on the crackdown on tax evasion, the
relaxed discipline in the financial sector, the confusion in the
credit system, the production, marketing and smuggling of fake and
shoddy products, and illegally producing and dealing in illicit
materials, in building up a new order of the socialist market
economy. It is also necessary to deepen the reform in the
distribution system.

<P>
Reform and development of state-owned enterprises must be
accelerated, and economic efficiency of enterprises must be
vigorously improved, as a higher priority will be placed on the
strengthening of those enterprises next year, according to the
conference.
</P>
<P>
To do so, it will be crucial to further emancipate the mind,
and adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts, making
judgement with the ultimate yardstick of whether it contributes to
developing the productive forces of the socialist society, to
strengthening the overall capabilities of the country, and to
improving the people's living standards, as set by Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be redoubled especially in the following four
areas next year:
</P>
<P>
1. To push ahead with the direction of reform in state-owned
enterprises and fully implement the basic principles of reform. In
building up a modern enterprise system, it is necessary to sum up
experience drawn from experimental efforts, to extend the test on
a larger scale and to perfect reform measures, with efforts to
solve key and difficult problems, thus ensuring new progress made
in changing the mechanism of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
While seeking to ensure good operation of large enterprises,
smaller ones can be handled with more flexibility, in pushing
forward the strategic readjustment and regrouping of state-owned
enterprises. It is important to overally carry out the
reorganizing, restructuring and transformation of state-owned
enterprises, along with efforts to strengthen internal management,
so as to improve the quality and efficiency of the
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Japanese Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today reassured Chinese President Jiang Zemin that Japan
is willing to improve and develop ties with China whole-heartedly
through an all-out effort.
</P>
<P>
"Like Japanese-U.S. ties, the Japanese-Chinese relations are of
great importance in the country's foreign policy," Hashimoto said,
adding that he has said time and again that the steady development
of bilateral relations is important for the stability and
development of the Asia and Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Hashimoto are here for the fourth informal leadership
meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that in retrospect of the Sino-Japanese ties
which have a history of more than 2,000 years, friendship and
cooperation have been the major aspect.
</P>
<P>
"It must be noted, however," Jiang stressed, "Japan, among all
foreign powers, was the one that inflicted the severest damage on
China due to the aggressive wars waged by Japanese militarists."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that late Chairman Mao Zedong,
Premier Zhou Enlai, other Chinese leaders of the older generation
and their successors have always held that the few Japanese
militarists are the culprits to blame for the aggressive wars.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese militarists had to be responsible whereas the
Japanese people are themselves victims as well of the militarism,"
Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese prime minister said that next year will witness
the 25th anniversary of the normalization of Sino-Japanese
diplomatic relations and that the Japanese are to develop
bilateral ties on the basis of the Sino-Japanese joint statement
and the Sino-Japanese treaty of peace and friendship.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said that the Japanese government admits the
catastrophe Japanese colonial rule and aggressive wars had
inflicted upon the peoples of various Asian nations in the past.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese domestic propensity to revive militarism will not
be allowed, Hashimoto promised, and the Japanese government will
reconsider the past in earnest.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president emphasized that it has been his country's
long-held belief that lessons must be drawn from previous
mistakes. No progress will be made without straightly facing what
has taken place in the past, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is only advisable for senior Japanese government officials
not to visit the (Yasukuni) Shrine again," said Jiang. "As proved
by events in the more than two decades that have passed, bilateral
relations will develop smoothly so long as we face history as it
is and implement our declaration to the letter."
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said, bilateral ties will be affected by unwanted
interference.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president urged the Japanese government to
forestall a possible duplicate of the historical tragedy. It is
necessary for the Japanese side to exert a stricter restraint upon
its domestic attempt to revive militarism.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese side should strengthen the education of its
younger generation, especially in the cultivation of a correct
conception of history," Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto reassured President Jiang Zemin that his government
will take what is necessary to prevent like events from happening
again on the Diaoyu Islands.
</P>
<P>
"The Diaoyu Islands have been an intrinsic part of Chinese
territory since ancient times," the Chinese president reiterated.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said though the Japanese side has different views on this
issue, the Japanese government should nevertheless take further
precautions to prevent similar events from happening again.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The leftist coalition,
comprised of ruling Socialist Party of Serbia, the Yugoslav Left
and New Democracy, has won a sweeping victory in Serbia' second
round of local elections held last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The coalition triumphed in 73.4 percent of the republic's
municipalities, including such major cities as Smederevo, Tanjug
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The third round of elections will be held in 18 municipalities
next Sunday because of polling irregularities, it said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition coalition Zajedno (Together), comprised of the
Serbian Renewal Movement, the Democratic Party and the Civic
Alliance of Serbia, scored victory in 7.56 percent of the
municipalities. Other parties won majority in eight other
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zajedno representatives and supporters, refusing to
accept official results and claiming their victory in local
elections, held another protest rally in central Belgrade Saturday
afternoon and in some other cities as well.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, Zajedno leaders have repeatedly accused
the government of massive fraud by annulling votes which gave the
opposition sweeping victories in 10 of the 15 biggest towns in
Serbia. Zajedno leaders have organized protest rallies in capital
city Belgrade and other towns across Serbia.

<HEADLINE> Iran Aborts Anti-German Demonstration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian policemen today
aborted an anti-German demonstration in front of the Germany
Embassy here as a positive gesture by the Iranian government to
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's call.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 Islamic extremists marched on the street at 10:00
a.m. this morning and tried to stage the anti-German
demonstration in front of the German Embassy in a protest
against Bonn for insulting the Iranian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Interior Minister for Security Affairs Hossein
Bolandien personally directed hundreds of baton-wielding
policemen and security agents who turned away the protesters from
the Islamic extremists group Ansar Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Another group of protesters from labor unions was turned back
before they had a chance to reach the central Tehran district
where the mission is located.
</P>
<P>
Iranian protesters have staged four anti-German
demonstrations in front of the German Embassy this week. They
threw tomatoes, eggs and rock at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
However, this is the first time for the Iranian security
authorities to ban the demonstration in front the German
Embassy. The move shows that Tehran does not want to see the
escalation of the crisis in the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Many political specialists noted that Iran would lose much
more than what German will lose both politically and
economically. German is Iran's largest trade partner with the
trade volume expected to reach 4 billion U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
German Federal prosecutors have accused Iranian leaders,
including Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani, of involvement in the 1992 murder of four
Iranian opposition members in a Berlin restaurant.
</P>
<P>
Kohl sent a written message to Rafsanjani on November 21,
saying he was very worried that the Germany-Iranian relations
would be harmed.
</P>
<P>
Kohl made it clear that "we have no intention to increase the
escalation of the current crisis."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani has tried to ease the strong anti-German wave in
Iran. He said that he would soon respond to Kohl's message on the
crisis and expressed the hope that the dispute would soon be
settled.

<HEADLINE> Iran Unveils Budget for 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran today unveiled the budget
for the 1997 fiscal year, which calls for a total spending of
188,150 billion rials (62.71 U.S. billion dollars), an increase of
35 percent over the current budget.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani today presented to
the parliament the national budget bill for the next fiscal year
starting March 21.
</P>
<P>
Under the deficit-free budget, 29,108 billion rials (9.7
billion dollars) is allocated to development and 81,286 billion
rials (27 billion dollars) to government expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Hamid Mirzadeh, Head of the country's Plan and Budget
Organization, said 25 percent of Iran's public revenue next
year is to be collected by taxation, 41 percent from oil and 34
percent from other sources.
</P>
<P>
He expected an average oil price of 17.5 dollars per
barrel next year.
</P>
<P>
One feature of the bill lies on its stress on anti-poverty
projects, social equity, subsidies for strategic products,
financial discipline and a more serious pursuit of a rational
economy independent of oil.
</P>
<P>
In the new budget, the U.S. dollar is estimated at the rate of
one against 3,000 rials. The annual inflation rate is expected to
be round 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government targets to earn a total of 17.7 billion
dollars of foreign exchange next year, 10.8 per cent higher than
the current year.
</P>
<P>
Concerning repayment of foreign debt, Mirzadeh said, the
government will pay 1.6 billion dollars to foreign creditors,
and this sum might increase should the government's oil revenues
be augmented.

PARIS, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-four people out of a total
of 175 passengers and crew have survived the crash of a Boeing 767
of the Ethiopian Airlines hijacked Saturday, the Agence France
Presse (AFP) quoted Comoran Foreign Ministry as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Two of the three hijackers, both Ethiopian nationals, were
among the survivors, who represent a dozen nationalities.
</P>
<P>
After being hijacked in the airspace of Kenya at 11:30 (08:30
GMT), the plane changed its direction to Tanzania. But it was
forced to land on the sea off the Comoros after running out of gas.
</P>

2. To effectively strengthen enterprise management, which is
not only the requirement for deepening the reform but also a
pressing task for enterprises.
</P>
<P>
3. To do a good job in the reorganizing and building of leading
bodies of state-owned enterprises. A comprehensive examination of
the leading groups of state-owned enterprises will be conducted
next year. Workers' representative conferences should strengthen
democratic assessment and supervision over the leading groups of
enterprises. Future efforts will be made to improve the
construction of leading groups at enterprises in accordance with
the socialist market-oriented economic system.
</P>
<P>
4. To work towards the creation of a favorable environment and
conditions for deepening the reform of enterprises. In this
regard, it is necessary to advocate and encourage the use of
domestic-made equipment and products. More effective measures
should be taken to raise funds through various channels and ease
the difficulties facing the enterprises. It is imperative to put
an end to imposing quotas and service charges, to speed up
coordinated reforms in corresponding aspects, especially the
establishment of a social security system, and to actively
implement the re-employment project.

<HEADLINE> Draft Law on Stationing Troops in HK Acclaimed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The draft law on stationing
troops in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) was
well received by Hong Kong residents, according to a seminar held
here from November 22 to 24.
</P>
<P>
Most of the participants believed that the draft reflects the
"one country, two systems" principle and is in complete accordance
with the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR, and that it will
guarantee that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops stationed
in Hong Kong will fulfill their obligations according to the law.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Maria Tam Wai-chu, a member of the
legal panel of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR,
said she was pleased with the draft, and that it illustrates the
central government's concern with maintaining Hong Kong's
prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Tam Yiu-chung, a Preparatory Committee member, said the Hong
Kong citizens responded well to the draft law, and that the major
newspapers in Hong Kong also made a positive assessment of it.
</P>
<P>
Kan Fook-yee, a Hong Kong deputy to China's National People's
Congress (NPC), said the draft law is even stricter than the
present law governing the British troops in the region and their
conduct.
</P>
<P>
"Things will be better after 1997," Kan said.
</P>
<P>
Participants offered many detailed opinions and suggestions on
how to further improve the draft law, including issues of
relations between the troops and the SAR government, the troops'
obligations, and who has jurisdiction over the military personnel.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was designed to solicit opinions for the draft law
on stationing PLA troops in the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Present at the seminar were representatives of the Legislative
Affairs Commission of the NPC Standing Committee, legislative
bureaus of the Central Military Commission and the State Council,
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council,
Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch; and Hong Kong members of the
legal panel of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR,
Hong Kong deputies to the NPC, Hong Kong members of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, as well as people from
the legal circles of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Albania to Set up More Free Economic Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Sali Berisha
said Saturday more free economic zones should be set up in Albania.
</P>
<P>
"I hope more cities should set up free economic zones," the
president told representatives of newly-elected mayors during
October local election.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of economic zones is designed not only to absorb
more foreign investment, but also create better conditions for
investment by those Albanian investors who returned from abroad,
said the president.
</P>
<P>
It was believed in the past that free economic zones should be
confined only to two or three cities, Berisha said, adding that he
hopes that more cities will establish free economic zones.
</P>
<P>
Albania has set up a national committee on free economic
zones.

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Anyone wondering why Asian business leaders showed such
intense interest in the inner working of the American political
system this fall could be explained by the increasingly central
role of the United States in setting or vetoing the rules of
global trade.
</P>
<P>
-- With President Bill Clinton out of the country, predicting
who will become the nation's next Secretary of State is being
played with feverish intensity back home.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Eager to pursue a recent thaw in relations with China,
President Clinton Sunday morning met with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and announced that the two leaders will exchange state
visits in the first half of Clinton's second term.
</P>
<P>
-- In a conference room at the White House last week, a senior
Clinton administration official was contemplating a difficult
decision: whether a planned international military force in
central Africa should take control of the airport in Goma, Zaire.
</P>
<P>
-- A hijacked Ethiopian airliner with 175 people aboard ran out
of fuel over the Indian Ocean on Saturday and crashed just off a

<HEADLINE> One Israeli Soldier Killed in Hezbollah Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, announced that they killed one
Israeli soldier in attacks today at Israeli forces in south
Lebanon in retaliation for Israeli bombardments.
</P>
<P>
Israeli artillery shelled sporadically a number of targets in
the vicinities of Lebanese villages in Nabatiyeh area at dawn
today, security sources in south Lebanon said.
</P>
<P>
They said that around 9:30 a.m. (07:30 GMT), the Israeli
troops and militiamen of Israel's client South Lebanon Army
fired heavy machine guns from their positions in the so-called
"security zone" at roads opposite the border strip.
</P>
<P>
The sweeping forced south Lebanese villagers in the area to
stay in their houses, the security sources added.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the Israeli provocations, Hezbollah said,
its guerrillas launched several Katyusha rockets at the Israeli
position of Zamrieh in the eastern sector of Israel's buffer
zone.
</P>
<P>
The attack led to an exchange of fire between the Israeli
forces and Hezbollah guerrillas, which lasted until
noon, the Lebanese Shiite Moslem party said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah,
announced that its snipers shot dead an Israeli soldier near the
Israeli front position of Dabsheh.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Israeli forces evacuated the soldier's body
with a tank to inside the occupied enclave.
</P>
<P>
Following the guerrilla attacks, Israeli forces intensified
its bombardments at suspected guerrilla targets, especially the
heights of Iglim Al-Toffah and the Litani River basin.
</P>
<P>
However, security sources in south Lebanon affirmed that
today's exchanges of fire did not go beyond the daily frictions
on the last active battle front of Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Before today's clashes, 24 Israeli soldiers had been killed
and more than 80 others wounded by Hezbollah's Shiite militants
in south Lebanon since this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometers buffer zone
along Lebanon's south border stretching from the Mediterranean
coast to the Mount Hermon, to safeguard security of Jewish
settlements in northern Israel.

<HEADLINE> Central Economic Work Conference Held in Beijing (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The conference also emphasized the necessity of maintaining
continuity, stability and some flexibility in next year's overall
macro economic policies, thus ensuring progress through stability.
</P>
<P>
It is highly imperative to maintain stability in political,
economic and social life, while adopting positive policies and
measures to inject new vitality into the economy, and also
concentrating on improving the quality and efficiency of economic
growth to advance a better development of reform and economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
Towards that, it is necessary to accomplish coordination in
four aspects of the economy: First, to seek successful structural
adjustment as well as the control of gross economic volume;
Second, to ensure both micro enlivening and macro-economic
control; Third, to deepen reform while pushing for development;
Fourth, to match social development with economic development.
</P>
<P>
Participants also pointed out that in 1997, it will be
imperative to concentrate on the key points affecting the overall
situation, as a way to seek progress in the entire reform and
reconstruction effort.
</P>
<P>
To do this, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the
foundation of agriculture, and promote the sustained and steady
growth in the sector.
</P>
<P>
A good harvest was reported this year. However, the push to
strengthen agriculture can never be relaxed, as agriculture is a
weak link in China, and the entire sector, especially grain
production, cannot slack off at any time or under any conditions.
</P>
<P>
Protecting farmland is also of vital importance, as is
continuing to increase input for agriculture, implementing the
strategy for using science and education to advance agriculture,
and furthering the restructuring of economic mechanisms and the
economic growth mode in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is also necessary to list strengthening the
construction of water-control facilities as one of next year's
crucial tasks. This should be one of the priorities for basic
construction from the central through local government levels.
</P>
<P>
It is also imperative to seize the favorable opportunities to
deepen reform in rural areas, especially that in circulation
mechanisms of farm produce.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural production structure must be rationally
readjusted according to market demands and the changes and
increases in farmers' incomes, while at the same time experiencing
no reduction in grain production.
</P>
<P>
The practice of holding provincial governors responsible for
"rice bag" work and city mayors for "vegetable basket" duties must
also be continued. ( More )

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Commentary on Draft Law on Stationing Troops in HK (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The draft law on stationing
troops in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) fully
reflects the principle of "one country, two systems," and has been
well received by the Hong Kong people, said a commentary written
by a Xinhua correspondent here today.
</P>
<P>
It also demonstrates the central government's determination to
place strict requirements on the People's Liberation Army (PLA)
troops stationed in Hong Kong, while administering their affairs
according to law, the commentary added.
</P>
<P>
It said that the draft law states that the troops, which will
be sent to the Hong Kong SAR for defense purposes after China
resumes exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997,
have four obligations: to resist and defend against invasion and
protect the safety of the Hong Kong SAR; to be responsible for
defense affairs and duties of the region; to manage military
facilities; and to be responsible for military affairs involving
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The commentary noted that the draft law clearly stipulates that
the troops are forbidden to interfere in the SAR's local affairs,
to participate in any political, religious or social
organizations, and to engage in profit-making businesses or other
activities that have no connection with their duties.
</P>
<P>
These stipulations fully respect the SAR's high-degree of
autonomy and lay a solid legal foundation for how to handle the
relations between the future SAR government and the PLA troops,
the commentary stressed.
</P>
<P>
Stipulations on the jurisdiction of criminal cases involving
military personnel, it said, also illustrate the "one country, two
systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
According to the legal system in the inland areas, criminal
cases handled by military personnel are all under the jurisdiction
of military courts, the commentary said, adding that but, taking
into the consideration the fact that Hong Kong's legal system is
different from that of the inland areas, the draft law clearly
defines that the courts in the SAR will have jurisdiction over
cases concerned with military personnel suspected of infringing on
Hong Kong residents' rights of personal freedom and of property,
or of violating the SAR laws when off duty.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the courts in the SAR will have no less jurisdiction
than they do now, it said.

<HEADLINE> Central Economic Work Conference Held in Beijing (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The conference pointed out that after three years' work, China
has achieved a sustained, rapid and healthy growth of the national
economy, successfully avoided possible fluctuations in the
economy, and solved the problems and contradictions once
encountered in the economic strides, such as the excessive growth
of investment and consumption, a chaotic state in the financial
sector, and extra-high price hikes.
</P>
<P>
The overall economy has been on a moderately rapid and smooth
development track. And the pre-set target of macro-economic
control, centered around curbing inflation, has basically been met.
</P>
<P>
The conference stated that these achievements are the result of
comprehensively carrying out Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the Party's basic
lines, as well as the concentrated efforts of the whole Party and
nation.
</P>
<P>
Experience has shown that the Party Central Committee's
decision on deepening reform, strengthening and improving
macro-economic control is fully correct, while a series of
policies and measures adopted towards that end are appropriate.
</P>
<P>
This also testifies to the fact that the Party's understanding
of the socialist market economic system and the laws governing
socialist modernization has been improving, and its capacity for
leading and commanding economic work has also been enhanced,
according to the conference.

It noted that the draft law also stipulates the specific
procedures, designed to ease the concerns of Hong Kong people of
all walks of life, to be followed by the government of the Hong
Kong SAR should it need to ask the Central People's Government for
military assistance to maintain public order or for disaster
relief.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that it is obvious that the stationing of
troops in Hong Kong after 1997 is being handled according to a
legal system, and that the new law will become an important means
of regulating the troops' actions in accordance with laws in both
China's inland areas and the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Of course, it is very difficult to draft such a law to reflect
the principle of "one country, two systems," and to govern the
army under the different legal systems, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it said, a special group to draft the law was
founded at the outset by the Central Military Commission, and the
group has not only carried out an in-depth study of Hong Kong's
legal system, but also drawn on foreign countries' experience in
formulating military laws, and fully heeded opinions and
suggestions from the public figures in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
While soliciting opinions about the new law from the Hong Kong
people over the past few days, the commentary said, leading
members of departments concerned repeatedly expressed the hope
that the public figures from Hong Kong will air their views from
different perspectives in order to perfect the law and allow it to
conform to the actual situation in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It is fully believed that this law is certain to be welcomed by
the Hong Kong people, and that it will symbolize the principle of
"one country, two systems," the commentary concluded.

<HEADLINE> Central Economic Work Conference Held in Beijing (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, the conference stressed the importance of not
underestimating the problems that exist in current economic life,
while viewing the overall economic situation in a positive light.
</P>
<P>
While the contradictions of the gross economic volume have
eased noticeably, structural problems in the economy have become
increasingly acute.
</P>
<P>
Overlapping projects, driven by a tendency to seek
all-embracing complexities on both large and small scales, pose
tremendous challenges. The existing weak agricultural foundation
has not been fundamentally improved. And some state-owned
enterprises have been facing difficulties in production and
operation, reporting poor economic results.
</P>
<P>
Participants called for greater attention paid to these
problems and earnest efforts to be made to solve them.
</P>
<P>
The conference decided that the guiding principle for economic
work in 1997 will be to adhere to Deng Xiaoping's theory for
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, fully implement
the Party's basic lines and basic principles, and carry out the
spirit of the Fifth and Sixth plenary sessions of the 14th Party
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Towards that, the conference called for earnest efforts to be
made to advance the restructuring of economic mechanisms and
economic growth patterns; to continue to practice a
moderately-tight financial and monetary control policy; to reduce
commodity price hikes; to solidify the foundation of agriculture;
to accelerate the pace of reform, especially reform in state-owned
enterprises; to intensify the strength for structure adjustment;
to cultivate new economic growth outlets; to actively explore the
market; to improve the capacity for opening-up; and to promote a
sustained, rapid and healthy development of the national economy
and the overall progress of the society.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. Meeting Friendly, Positive, Constructive: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today described as "friendly, positive and constructive" his
meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Clinton both expressed great pleasure to meet each
other at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum which
will culminate in Monday's APEC informal leadership meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents agreed that their meeting today, the fourth
since 1993, is of great importance as a link between the history
and the future.
</P>
<P>
Both arriving here on Saturday, Jiang and Clinton had scheduled
to discuss issues of common concern for an hour, but they were
overtime for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Asked how he felt about their fourth meeting during a photo
session, the Chinese president said that he was very pleased.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that both the United States, the largest developed
country in the world, and China, the largest developing one, have
exerted great influence worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"Sino-U.S. relations not only affect the fundamental interests
of the two peoples," the Chinese president said, "but inevitably
affect the world peace, stability and development."
</P>
<P>
Direct dialogues between the heads of state of the two
countries, Jiang added, will be conducive to reducing or even
wiping out differences.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed during the meeting that there is still
difference on some issues, but understanding can be deepened and
problems solved through dialogue and contacts on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that though bilateral relations have undergone
vicissitudes in the past three years, the overall trend is toward
improvement, especially in the last six months, during which
increased high-level visits have solved some of the problems which
at a time troubled the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"I should say that bilateral relations have seen obvious
improvement," the Chinese president said. "And favorable factors
in the development of bilateral ties are increasing."
</P>
<P>
The two countries "now stand an advantageous chance in
improving the relations between them," Jiang observed.
</P>
<P>
He said that though he met Clinton four times, today's was the
first after Clinton won the re-election. Jiang congratulated
Clinton on his re-election during the meeting while Clinton
extended his gratitude.
</P>
<P>
Fresh from his victory over Republican presidential candidate
Bob Dole in the early November election, Clinton promised during
last week's trip to Australia just before the APEC meeting that it
is one of his major second-term tasks to improve bilateral
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was struck during today's meeting that the two
presidents will exchange state visits in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also agreed that U.S. Vice President Al Gore will
first visit China early next year. He is to meet and discuss with
Chinese Premier Li Peng bilateral relations and international
issues of common concern.

<HEADLINE> 50 Survive Ethiopian Airline Plane Crash, 68 Die </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Fifty passengers survived the
crash of the ET-961 plane of the Ethiopian Airlines yesterday
with three in critical condition, a press release said today.
</P>
<P>
The release issued here this afternoon by the airlines said
that 68 bodies have been recovered and 57 have not yet been
accounted for.
</P>
<P>
The sea at the accident site was too hostile for speedy rescue
operation, the release noted. The rescue team is still working
on the scene, Symon Khamasi, Sales Manager of the airlines in
Nairobi, told reporters here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 175 passengers, 83 boarded the aircraft at Addis
Ababa while the rest were transit passengers from other
locations, the release noted.
</P>
<P>
Among those who boarded at Addis Ababa are passengers of 24
nationalities while the nationalities of the transit passengers
are still being compiled, it added.
</P>
<P>
Khamasi confirmed that there are no Chinese passengers aboard
the airplane.
</P>
<P>
The release pointed out that the airlines was first informed
that the flight was hijacked at 08:30 hours GMT by yet unknown
persons who forced the flight to divert from its course.
</P>
<P>
Around 11:47 hours GMT the plane ditched in the sea about one
kilometer near a beach hotel called Galawa in one of the Comoros
Islands.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the accident, rescue operation was carried out by
the Comoros Authorities who were supported by a French military
contingent stationed nearby, the press release stated.
</P>
<P>
The plane, taking off from Addis Ababa and scheduled for
Abidjan via Nairobi, Brazzaville and Lagos, ran out of fuel when
three hijackers tried to take it to Australia.

<P>
According to the conference, China's overall economic situation
has been doing well since the beginning of this year, promising a
good start for the Ninth Five-Year-Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The improved economic situation is best illustrated in three
ways. First, China has effectively brought inflation under control
while maintaining a rapid growth in its economy.
</P>
<P>
Second, the country has achieved a balance between the total
supply and total demand of the society, and the macro-economic
environment has been further improved. Investment is now roughly
equal to the growth in the country's consumption demand, along
with an adequate market supply, a stable financial and monetary
situation, a balance of international revenue and expenditure, and
a marked increase in foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
Finally, reform and opening-up has been carried out in depth,
which has aided the coordinated development of the economy and
society. Reform in state-owned enterprises has been intensified,
and some new experimental methods were carried out in the
process. Also, newly-adopted reform programs in finance, taxation
concerning foreign businesses, management of foreign exchanges and
prices have been carried out smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The use of foreign funds has continued to grow, while people's
living conditions have been further improved, according to the
conference. (More )

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Encourage Investments in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Sueharto
today vowed to actively encourage other Islamic countries to
invest in the Philippines' Mindanao island, where peace returned
after a major Muslim rebel group there struck a peace deal with
Manila in September.
</P>
<P>
Sueharto made the statement during his brief talks with his
Philippine counterpart, Fidel Ramos, in Manila this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia played a major role in brokering the September peace
agreement between Manila and the rebel Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF), which ended almost 30 years of bloody fratricidal
strife in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Sueharto said the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) will
meet in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta in December.
</P>
<P>
"That will be a very good occasion to call their attention and
commitment to help in the development of Mindanao which, I think,
will not only be for the welfare of Filipino Muslims but for the
entire Filipino people," Sueharto said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos thanked Sueharto for his "big help" in ensuring the
success of the Mindanao peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agreed to further intensify economic
cooperation between their two countries, especially between
Mindanao and the Indonesian provinces in the East Growth Area of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (EAGA).
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that with peace fully restored in Mindanao,
Indonesia can now maximize its participation in the development of
the EAGA, particularly in the establishment of service-oriented
enterprises and agricultural joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
"We are now concentrating on economic development, now that we
have solved the political crisis in Mindanao," Ramos said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official on Law on Stationing Troops in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Yang Fukun, director of the
Legislative Bureau of the Central Military Commission, said here
today the law on stationing troops in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) mainly lists stipulations on a number
of issues of principle, and that it cannot be all-inclusive.
</P>
<P>
Based on China's constitution and the Basic Law of the Hong
Kong SAR, the new law will also serve as a bridge between the
national laws and the Hong Kong laws, he added.
</P>
<P>
Yang listened to opinions of the delegates from the Law Society
of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Bar Association on the draft law on
stationing troops in Hong Kong, and said the People's Liberation
Army (PLA) troops sent by the central people's government to Hong
Kong are for defense purposes, and are essentially different from
the British troops stationed there, in terms of both their general
nature and duties.
</P>
<P>
As the PLA troops will be confronted by a society that is
different from that of the inland and abides by different laws, it
is necessary to formulate a new law to handle some principles, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Yang said the Basic Law has made principled stipulations on the
troops stationed in Hong Kong, pointing out that the draft law on
stationing troops in Hong Kong has given more detailed
stipulations, based on the Basic Law, while taking into
consideration the troops' obligations.
</P>
<P>
But it is impossible for the draft law to cover everything, he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Wild horses are increasing
in the Hustain Nuruu natural protection area in Mongolia's Tov
Province, an adviser to the Nature and Environment Ministry told
the press recently.
</P>
<P>
The number of wild horses in Mongolia has come to 54, 17 of
them were bred in the country, which, along with China, are the
hometown of the rare animal.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia first set up the protection area for wild horses in
June, 1992, when 15 wild horses were introduced from a zoo of the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Scientists of Mongolia and the Netherlands have been
cooperating in the breeding of wild horses, which became extinct
in the field in the mid-20th century.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia introduced 10 wild horses from the Netherlands this
year and will introduce another 15 horses in 1998 and 2000 to make
the protection area really become an important base for the
breeding of wild horses.
</P>
<P>
Different species of wild horses will be introduced from
Denmark and other countries to prevent the possible degeneration
resulted from inbreeding.

<HEADLINE> Indian Steel Producers Propose Regulatory Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Indian steel producers have
proposed a regulatory duty on imports to work as a trigger price
mechanism against possible low-priced imports to protect the
domestic steel industry, Industry Ministry sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
There has been persistent slump in steel prices in the global
market. Increasing prices for hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel
would be difficult because landed cost of imports is less than the
price of locally-made steel.
</P>
<P>
India is expected to experience a demand boom for steel
products once the various infrastructure projects enter the
construction phase, the same sources said.
</P>
<P>
India has potential to emerge as a major global steel player in
the world market with the country's economy becoming more
market-oriented, according to major steel producers in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Asia Pacific rim countries are expected to witness a
shortfall of about 45-50 million tons by the turn of the century
and it is important that India takes a lead in expanding the steel
industry and takes advantage of the additional demand likely to be
generated over the next few years, they said.

<HEADLINE> More Poor People in Central China Say Farewell to Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Efforts over the past decade
to give aid to the poor by initiating development projects have
helped more than eight million poor people in central China become
prosperous.
</P>
<P>
Information from Henan Province shows that the work has helped
the province reduce its poor population by 8.15 million to the
present 5.6 million, compared to the 13.75 million poor people ten
years ago.
</P>
<P>
China's population below the poverty line was listed at 85
million at the end of 1990, and dropped to 65 million last
year. National statistics on the impoverished population exclude
those of the 12 million urban residents who live under the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
China's official poverty line has been changing from time to
time and from place to place. Currently, in rural areas, a
resident is classified as poor if he earns less than 500 yuan (one
U.S. dollars equals to 8.3 Chinese yuan) a year.
</P>
<P>
The central Chinese government has pledged to eliminate poverty
in rural China by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investors Eye Farm Sector in Heilongjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang Province, a major
grain production base in China, has attracted more overseas
investors to invest in its agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Investors from Taiwan Province, Hong Kong and dozens of foreign
countries have arrived in the province to cooperate in
agricultural development and farm product processing.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the overseas investment has been
attracted by rich farm resources and preferential policies in the
province. And another factor is the increasing demands of world
grain markets, they said.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang Province, in the northeasternmost part of China,
is well-known for its favorable natural conditions to develop
agriculture, animal husbandry and fisheries.
</P>
<P>
Its production of wheat, soybean, beet and flax are taking the
lead in the country.
</P>
<P>
The province has 8.1 million hectares of cultivated land, of
which 5.33 million are of low-yielding land, and it also has 3.81
million hectares of cultivable land that is left untouched.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local farm product processing industries have
remained underdeveloped.
</P>
<P>
All these factors have pointed to a promising future for
overseas investors to make profits by participating in local farm
production processing.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations issued by the provincial government,
all local and overseas individuals and institutions are allowed to
buy management-and use-rights of uncultivated land and waters, for
a time span of 30 to 70 years.

<HEADLINE> Pak Former PM Files 3rd Petition to Supreme Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Benazir Bhutto, the deposed
Pakistani prime minister, today filed another, amended petition to
the Supreme Court against the dismissal of her government.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto's lawyer Aitzaz Ahsan and former Law Minister Raza
Rabbani submitted relevant documents to the registrar of the
Supreme Court on behalf of Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time that Bhutto has filed petition to the
Supreme Court after she was fired by President Farooq Leghari.
</P>
<P>
Court sources said the new petition did not contain the
material deemed objectionable by the court in the first writ filed
by Bhutto on November 13.
</P>
<P>
The apex court returned the petition on Tuesday on the grounds
that it contained scandalous, frivolous and unnecessary material.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto filed a modified version of the petition again on
Thursday but attached a letter raising objections to the
registrar's refusal to entertain the earlier writ.
</P>
<P>
The court returned the petition for the second time, saying the
letter and the modified petition were contradictory to each other.
</P>
<P>
According to Pakistani laws, the dismissed government must
manage to file a petition in the Supreme Court challenging its
dismissal within one month following its dissolution.

<HEADLINE> Subic Bay Ready to Welcome APEC Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Subic Bay, Philippines, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Four years
after American troops pulled out of here, leaders of the 18
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies will gather in
Subic Bay Freeport on November 25 to firm up action plans that
will establish free trade and investment in the region over the
next century.
</P>
<P>
With the help of 8,000 volunteers, Subic Bay Metropolitan
Authority Chairman Richard Gordon has turned the former Subic
Naval Base into a free port with its own airport, seaport,
satellite system, highway and bustling tourism.
</P>
<P>
"Subic achieved what no other city had done," said Gordon. "We
built an airport, an all-optic-fiber telecommunications network, a
water and sewerage system, a satellite system, a new highway, and
with the investment of 237 large companies, a cyberspace
infrastructure and a 116-megawatt power plant all with four
years!"
</P>
<P>
The Subic Bay is celebrating its fourth anniversary of the end
of 94 years of American presence as leaders of the APEC member
economies converge here to hold their Fourth Informal Leadership
Meeting.
</P>
<P>
Gordon said the most important thing Subic could present to the
APEC leaders "is the character of the people who rebuilt this
facility."
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Fidel Ramos, in choosing the Subic free
port as the venue for the APEC leaders' gathering, is to showcase
the new character of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The free port also represents the APEC's ideal of free trade.
Business here goes by the global standard in terms of speed and
time.
</P>
<P>
Much has changed since the last American troops were stationed
in this former naval base, the largest outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
Military installations such as ammunition bunkers, repair
hangars, barracks and housing for American soldiers now fuel
Subic's economy, giving jobs to thousands and turning this former
naval facility into a prime industrial and commercial center in
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The old repair hangar used by the U.S. Air Force is now a 12
million-U.S.-dollar international airport passenger terminal,
while the runway used by U.S. jets has been widened and can now
accommodate Boeing-747 jets and giant cargo planes.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has implemented a detailed master plan to
convert the U.S. base into a free port, which coincided with the
APEC meeting.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Chinese, U.S. Presidents Meet in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of China and the
United States agreed to exchange visits in the next two years in
their meeting today, which Chinese President Jiang Zemin described
as "friendly, positive and constructive."
</P>
<P>
Jiang and the U.S. President Bill Clinton both expressed great
pleasure to meet each other, their fourth since 1993, amidst the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum which will culminate
in APEC Informal Leadership Meeting on Monday in Subic.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting which ran 10 minutes longer than the
scheduled one hour, the two presidents agreed that their meeting
is of importance of a link between history and future.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was struck during their meeting that the two
presidents will exchange state visits in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Although the details of the visits remained to be worked out,
observers here said that Jiang may travel to the United States
prior to or after next year's APEC forum due to be held in
Vancouver, Canada.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also agreed that U.S. Vice-President Al Gore
will visit China early next year. He is to meet Chinese Premier
Li Peng on bilateral relations and international issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Clinton have met three times previously, all at
neutral locations. They first met during the first APEC summit in
Seattle, the United States, in 1993 and the second time at the
following year's APEC forum in Bogor, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Failing to meet as scheduled at Osaka's APEC gathering in 1995,
the two made it up later in October when they met for the third
time during the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the United Nations in New York.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher visited Beijing last
week as a tune-up for the Jiang-Clinton meeting in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Clinton will also hold one-on-one meetings with
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and South Korean
President Kim Young-Sam, as most APEC leaders are trying to seize
the opportunity of enhancing ties.
</P>
<P>
In Monday's APEC informal leadership meeting, heads from the 18
members are expected to endorse a plan designed to produce
concrete results toward their stated goal of liberalizing trade
and investment by 2020.
</P>
<P>
In the Subic free port, some 80 kilometers northwest of Manila,
the leaders will sign the Manila Action Plan, which maps out steps
for each APEC member to take to achieve the common ambition.
</P>
<P>
The developed members of this trading bloc are required to
liberalize their trade and investment by the year 2010 while the
developing ones are given 10 more years to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The APEC now embraces 16 sovereign states. They include
Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Indonesia, Japan,
Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines,
the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Chinese Taipei joined APEC as regional
economies.

<P>
HANGZHOU, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Families living below the
state-set poverty line in east China's Zhejiang Province are to be
offered monthly relief by local governments. The move will ensure
that an estimated 100,000 people will be able to afford daily
necessities.
</P>
<P>
Three cities and six counties in the province have already set
their respective lowest living line, and pledged to implement a
new aid-the-poor project based on the new set level in the near
future. Other cities and counties in the province are also
accelerating their pace so that the scheme will be extended.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the lowest living line set in the province stands at
120 to 150 yuan, "but the line is sure to rise as people's living
standards improve," said an official concerned.
</P>
<P>
Some local governments have put up posters about the project at
eye-catching spots in stations and ports, urging residents who
meet the requirements to apply for the relief as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Early statistics show that as many as 100,000 people, mostly
elderly who lost their relatives, and disabled people who could
not earn a living for themselves, are now still living under the
lowest lining line set in the province.

<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- A 500 million-year old
geological demarcation line in northeast China's Jilin Province is
one of the country's newest destinations for tourists and
geologists from around the world.
</P>
<P>
Dayangcha, a small town in province's Jiangyuan county has
become famous both at home and abroad because of the attraction.
</P>
<P>
There are now only two Cambrian-Ordovician geological
demarcation lines in the world, the other one is in Canada.
</P>
<P>
And experts said that the Dayangcha Cambrian-Ordovician
geological demarcation line is the best in the world, since it
boasts large varieties of fossilized prehistoric creatures and
complete depositions.
</P>
<P>
Each year many geologists have journeyed to Dayangcha for
on-the-spot studies since the site was discovered 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
This geological wonder is less than an hours journey by car
from Baishan City, near the famous scenic Changbaishan Mountain in
Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
It is more than 30 meters long and seven meters high, and has
colorful rocks. Under the guidance of experts, tourists can
identify many fossilized prehistoric creatures such as trilobites
and graptolites.
</P>
<P>
Jilin provincial government established a geological nature
reserve in 1985, and has stationed people to protect the
geological site.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, an international meeting was held in Dayangcha, which
attracted more than 70 domestic and overseas paleontologies and
experts.
</P>
<P>
The local government have started work to build the geological
spot into a tourism site to attract more tourists.

<HEADLINE> 800-year-old Tomb with Stone Sculptures Found in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Stone sculptures of a
minister and a lion dating back to the Jin Dynasty (1115-1234) has
been found in a tomb in a suburb in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that they are the first Jin stone sculptures ever
found in Beijing, and will be useful for dating similar relics
found locally.
</P>
<P>
The stone minister sculpture, 1.9 meters tall, shows the
minister holding a tablet in front of his breast, a usual posture
of ancient Chinese officials received in audiences by the emperor.
</P>
<P>
The stone lion is 1.1 m high, 30 cm wide and 54 cm thick.
</P>
<P>
A 77 cm by 57 cm grave stone has also been found in the tomb,
bearing inscriptions, and decorated with the design of the Eight
Diagrams (eight combinations of three whole or broken lines
formerly used in divination), and the twelve animals representing
the twelve Earthly Branches used to symbolize the year in which a
person was born.
</P>
<P>
From the inscriptions the experts found that the tomb's occupant
was Gao Jun, a successful candidate in the highest imperial
examinations in the Jin Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Further excavations need to be conducted to clarify whether the
tomb is part of a burial ground of Gao's family.

Ahmad Shah Masood, the top commander of the ousted government
troops.

<HEADLINE> 54 Survive Ethiopian Airline Plane Crash, 50 Die </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- At least 50 people died when
a hijacked plane of the Ethiopian Airline crashed off the Comoro
Islands Saturday afternoon after it ran out of fuel, according to
a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
And 54 people survived the air crash of the Et-960 plane with
175 passengers and crew aboard, according to the report. The
fate of the others was not yet known. Most of the passengers
are Asians and Africans.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers are still doing their jobs at the scene.
</P>
<P>
The plane, taking off from Addis Ababa and scheduled for
Abidjan via Nairobi, Brazzaville and Lagos, ran short of fuel
when three hijackers, armed with a bomb and a knife, tried to
take it to Australia. It finally crashed off the Comoros coast at
around 15:00.
</P>
<P>
At one point, one hijacker attempted to fly the plane himself,
and wrenched the headset from the pilot. As a result, the pilot,
who was among the survivors, said he was unable to speak to air
control personnel as the plane neared the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
The pilot and co-pilot later identified two of the hijackers
among the survivors, and the two were arrested by police. But the
fate of the third hijacker was not yet known.
</P>
<P>
Airline officials said the hijackers were believed to be
transit passengers from Bombay.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian airlines said it would issue a full passenger
list later today.

<HEADLINE> Jiang, Clinton Meet Prior to APEC Leaders Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Asked how he felt about today's meeting, their fourth, during a
photo session before the APEC summit, Jiang said that he was glad.
</P>
<P>
He noted that though he had met Clinton four times, this was the
first after Clinton won the re-election, noting that he first met
his American counterpart in Seattle in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Staying in two hotels in Manila, the presidents held their
meeting in a third place, the Philippine Central Bank complex,
which drew scores of reporters from China, the United States and
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the charges from the Human Rights Watch, a
U.S.-based non-governmental organization, that his meeting with
Jiang was wrong, Clinton said: "I think we are doing the right
thing."
</P>
<P>
Fresh from his victory over Republican rival Bob Dole in
presidential polls in early November, Clinton said in last week's
trip to Australia that improving bilateral relations with China is
one of his major second-term tasks.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, scheduled for one full hour, ran 10 minutes
overtime.

<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 24 (Xinhua) -- A large Korean pine, aged at
least 480 years, is thriving on the Changbai Mountain in northeast
China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
The pine is over 35 meters tall and three adults are needed to
encircle with outstretched arms.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, a volcano not far away from
the pine, erupted in the years 1597, 1668 and 1702, but the
tree managed to survive.
</P>
<P>
The local forestry bureau has built white marble railings
around the tree and arranged people to take care of it.
</P>
<P>
The Changbai Mountain is one of the country's growing areas of
Korean pines, producing fine Korean pine seeds and timber. Korean
pines are also good at retaining rain water, according to
experts.

A report reaching here today said the rebels, who were
formerly based in Mahagi and Aru in northeastern Zaire,
surrendered voluntarily at different times.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, over 650 youths from Nebbi early this

WNBF, which was led by Juma Oris and first surfaced in
northern Uganda in May, 1995, wants to topple the country's
current government and reinstall former President Idi Amin who
was toppled in 1979.

<P>
WNBF of Oris, former Amin's aide, has 1000 men, mainly based
in southern Sudan.

Uganda National Resistance Front ii (UNRF ii) was formed. The
group is led by Ali Bamuze, a former officer of the defunct
Uganda Resistance Front led in early 1980 by Moses Ali, incumbent

HEFEI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- China's tourism revenue is
expected this year to top ten billion US dollars in foreign
currency for the first time, up about 15 percent over last year,
the China National Tourism Administration (CNTA) has predicted.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign tourist arrivals will increase by more

China ranked fifth in the world in the number of tourists from
overseas, and ninth in foreign currency earnings in 1995. The
country's tourism output value neared that of the country's
chemicals, machinery, and electronics industries, accounting for
3.64 percent of its annual gross domestic product (GDP).

Early statistics show that more than three million people
have shaken off poverty by developing tourism. In 1995, a total of
1.12 million people worked in tourism businesses and institutions.
</P>

The country took 15 years to raise the overseas tourism
earnings to five billion US dollars from 200 million, and from

CHENGDU, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese universities are
helping students improve their job winning prospects in the
country's new market economy era.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan United University and West China Medical University in
Chengdu, the capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, opened
extra classes and lectures for students to enhance their
comprehensive strengths in the competition to find jobs.
</P>
<P>
The classes and lectures were mainly on hot topics, such as
public relations, guide to satisfying employment, and guide to the
examinations for civil servants.
</P>
<P>
Medium and short term training classes on computers, accounting
and law have been very popular in universities throughout China.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of education reform, university graduates
are no longer assigned jobs by the state.
</P>
<P>
Market mechanisms have been introduced into job-finding, and as
a result competition has become increasingly fierce.
</P>
<P>
Schools and students are eager to have a better position in the
competition. As a result, many kinds of training classes and
lectures have emerged, winning praise from students.
</P>
<P>
In order to encourage students to grasp more knowledge and
enhance their competitive strength, a number of universities,
including Sichuan United University, stipulate that academically
excellent students can start a two-year second major program at
the spring term of the sophomore study.
</P>
<P>
They can win a diploma for their second major if they pass
the examinations needed.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe it is a triumph for higher education
development in the market economy. It is conducive both to the
training of jack-of-all-trades, and to wise selection of jobs for
graduates.

MANILA, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that China attaches great importance to the
development of its relations with the Republic of Korea and the
two countries should make common efforts to promote such
good-neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks when meeting with President of the
Republic of Korea Kim Young-sam. The two leaders exchanged views
on bilateral relations, including economic and trade cooperation
and the situation on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Both Jiang and Kim are scheduled to attend the informal
leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum in Subic, the Philippines, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the relations between China and the Republic of
Korea have developed smoothly in all areas since the two countries
established diplomatic ties four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have enhanced their coordination and
cooperation in dealing with international affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that the two countries should tap
the potential of cooperation in tourism, science and technology,
culture and other areas.
</P>
<P>
"The direct contacts between the leaders of the two countries
are of a great help to the development of the bilateral relations
in the future," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Kim said the two countries have made remarkable progress in
economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the investment of the Republic of Korea in China
has been increasing substantially during the past years and that
its trade volume with China is expected to reach 20 billion U.S.
dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation is conducive to the development of the
bilateral relations, Kim said.
</P>
<P>
"China and the Republic of Korea should strengthen cooperation
in dealing with international affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Korea supports China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) as "it is abnormal that China is not
included in the WTO," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the situation on the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his hope that the tension on the pennisula will
be eased because relaxation of tension there is conducive not only
to the interests of the two sides, but also to a lasting peace and
stability on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The relaxation of tension on the peninsula will also contribute
to peace and stability in Asia and the rest of the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the parties concerned should look into the future
and take the overall situation into account, Jiang said that they
should not be too particular about gains and losses concerning a
single act or in a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
Kim said that the Republic of Korea also hopes to see the
relaxation of tension on the peninsular, adding that the two sides
on the peninsula should make contacts and have dialogues.

<HEADLINE> Ningbo Legislature Makes 33 Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, November 24 (Xinhua) -- Local legislators in Ningbo
City in East China's Zhejiang Province have made full use of
its powers granted by the central authorities to make local laws.
</P>
<P>
In the past nine years the city's lawmakers have formulated and
revised 33 regulations and rules to promote economic development
and ethical and cultural progress in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the municipal people's congress of
Ningbo was granted legislative power in 1988 by the central
authorities. The aim was to make local rules to help build the
city into a modernized port city.
</P>
<P>
One of the most notable codes introduced was the regulations
on the development of Daxie Island, an economic development zone
within the region authorized by the State Council in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The regulations have been taken as a legal guarantee for the
build-up of the development zone.
</P>
<P>
Difficult points of public concern have also become the focus
of attention for local legislators. They made a provision
prohibiting the selling and setting off of fireworks after
canvassing public opinion, and referring to similar rules of
Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
This provision was acclaimed to be "the best enforced local
law."
</P>
<P>
Ningbo people prefer grand motorcades for their wedding
occasions. Many officials and their relatives were found enjoying
the privilege of using public limos for free.
</P>
<P>
To counter such corrupt practices, the legislature made a
specific rule several months ago banning the use of official cars
for weddings.
</P>
<P>
No public cars have since been found to be used on such
occasions, according to several law enforcement checks conducted
by the legislature.

The KNU, operating in areas bordering Thailand, is now the only
illegal ethnic armed group in Myanmar after the other 15 groups
have made peace with the government since SLORC took power in
1988.
</P>
<P>
The most recent surrender was of the infamous drug warlord Khun
San and his Mong Tai Army, who laid down their arms in January
this year.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt called for concerted efforts of all nationalities to
restore peace and work for modernization in the country.
</P>

The Chinese president said during the last meeting with Clinton
that China's basic policy on its relations with the U.S. is to
build mutual respect, diminish troubles, promote cooperation and
prevent confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, for his part, said that a powerful, stable and

and the only option for the U.S. China policy is constructive
engagement rather than isolation, confrontation or containment.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Province Sets up Disaster Relief System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, November 24 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province has
set up a sound disaster relief and control system, said a local
government official.
</P>
<P>
Located at an area affected by both northern and southern
climates, the province is frequently hit by natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the province has established centers with
complete forecast, audio-visual, telecommunications and
transportation equipment. To ensure the victims receive adequate
assistance, governments at various levels have set up a
responsibility system to deliver tents, food, medicine and clothes.
</P>
<P>
The government has also organized victims to drain off water
after floods, replant crops, and find jobs.
</P>
<P>
Since the country introduced reform and opening-up policies in
1978, Anhui has issued more than two billion yuan (about 241
million US dollars) of relief funds, aiding 68.9 million people
who have been affected by the disasters.
</P>
<P>
Every year, the province provides relief support to 12 million
victims. It also helps one million people to escape poverty
annually, twice the yearly figure before 1978, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Lithuania's population has been
on downing trend for four consecutive years, according to reports
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 1996, 30,242 babies were born in
the former republic of the Soviet Union, a reduction of 1,469
against the same period of last year, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Up to November 1, 1996, Lithuania had a population of 3.709
million, 3,000 less than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian Statistics Department attributed the population
reduction to the impact caused by the ongoing economic reform. The
major cause is that deaths outnumbered fertility in the country
over the past four years.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Relations between the Andean
Group (GRAN) and Mercosur will be reviewed here next week during a
seminar organized by the Cartagena Agreement Board.
</P>
<P>
The two Latin American trade blocs signed an agreement in June
1995 to integrate and form one free trade zone to further promote
trade and economic cooperation in the region.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar, which opens on Monday, will be attended by
representatives from the five Andean Group member countries,
experts in integration and in external relations of the Andean
Group, and some European speakers, a press release from the
organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Themes such as "GRAN-Mercosur Convergence Strategy,"
"Entrepreneurial Vision," "The Regional and Worldwide Projection
of Mercosur," and "GRAN-Mercosur Regional Impact" will be
discussed after the inaugural ceremony presided over by board
coordinator Jaime Cordoba Zuloaga.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is aimed to promote the economic complementation,
as well as the links between entrepreneurial sectors of both
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The GRAN, grouping Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and
Venezuela, was established in May 1969 with its headquarters in
Lima.

<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- The average age for residents
in China's 1.2 billion population has now risen to just over 33,
up from 28, as reported in 1990, according to the latest
statistics from the State Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The data show that in the 1991-1995 period, the annual growth
rate of birth in China averaged only 11.6 per thousand, compared
with 15.54 per thousand in the 1986-1990 period.
</P>
<P>
Experts said China will be listed as one of the world's aging
societies before the 21st century, as the segment of its
population aged between 60 and 65 accounts for 6.68 percent of the
total population, compared with 5.56 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The information also indicates the Chinese people's quality of
life has improved, due to the spread of the nine-year compulsory
education.
</P>
<P>
The number of those who have a college education has increased
by 56.03 percent over the figure in 1990, while the number of
those who have secondary education has increased by 24.72 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Poverty is so increasingly
rampant in Hungary that the era of "three-million-beggar country"
has re-emerged in some parts of the country, warned Hungarian
President Goncz Arpad.
</P>
<P>
Increasing poverty is collapsing the society and making it lose
the traditional fine spirit of mutual assistance, Goncz told a
seminar on Hungary's poverty issue held here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Gypsies, who account for 5-6 percent of the total Hungarian
population, are producing an "explosion" due to poverty while the
homeless and people relying on government relief are also living a
very miserable life, he said.
</P>
<P>
Poor agricultural output, he said, will further worsen the
poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 33 percent of Hungarian farmers are
unemployed, and the situation is deteriorating, added the
president.
</P>
<P>
Before the revolution in the 1930s when Horthy Miklos was in
power, there were three millions of beggars in Hungary.

<HEADLINE> Lukashenko Urges Belarussians to Vote on Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Belarus President Alexander
Lukashenko urged his people tonight to vote in a Sunday referendum
on constitutional amendments as the parliament vetoed a
Russia-brokered deal aimed to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address at 22:00 local time (19:00 GMT),
Lukashenko stressed that he had fulfilled all obligations he
assumed under a compromise agreement he reached with the
opposition-dominated parliament on Friday under Russia's
mediation, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the agreement was torpedoed by lawmakers who
represent the interests of those who are against Russian-Belarus
integration, those who have lost their portfolios of bureaucrats
after the president came to power, those who have not lined their
pockets at people's expense and those who lost the last
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The parliament, which has been engaged in a confrontation with
the president for several months, failed on Friday to approve the
compromise agreement reached by Lukashenko and parliament speaker
Semyon Sharetsky under mediation of Russian leaders including
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
The parliament said it could not accept provisions of the
agreement that the fate of the constitution will be decided by a
Constitutional Assembly consisting of representatives from both
the president and the parliament with the results of Sunday's
referendum being taken into account. The opposition lawmakers
insisted that a new constitution be adopted only by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"I am urging you to go not to a rally... as my political
opponents do, but to polling stations," the president said in the
address.
</P>
<P>
The referendum on Sunday, the first on the constitution in the
former Soviet republic's history, will decide what constitutional
amendments should be made. If Lukashenko's version, instead of the
parliament's one, wins, the new constitution would enlarge the
president's power.
</P>
<P>
"I will not allow those who want to make the referendum a
consultative one to mock at the will of the people. People are the
main source of state power and therefore they have the right not
to consult, but to decide by what constitution all of us should
have. Your opinion will be a law for everyone," Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
"Your decision will be final, binding and irreversible. I will
find ways and means to make sure that the will of the people is
binding on all in our republic -- for all bodies of power and all
citizens of our state," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the constitutional court of Belarus put off until
Tuesday a decision on an attempt by deputies to remove Lukashenko
from office by impeachment.

<HEADLINE> Graf Faces Hingis in Best-of-Five Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November (Xinhua) -- Steffi Graf spent two hours to
survive from a first set down for a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 win over Jana
Novotna Saturday, setting up a final showdown with 16-year-old
Martina Hingis in the title match of the two million U.S. dollars
Chase Championships.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's best-of-5 sets final - the only time women play
more than three sets - Graf will meet the young Swiss stars, the
No. 7 seed, who defeated 19-year-old Iva Majoli of Croatia 6-2,
4-6, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's victory was the 30th triumph for Graf in Madison
Square Garden and also clinched the year's No. 1 ranking for the
German star, who had been co-ranked in the top spot with Monica
Seles, a first-round loser in this tournament.
</P>
<P>
With the victory over Majoli, Hingis has a chance to become
only the second player to win this tournament in her debut. The
only one to do it was Evonne Goolagong in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's singles champion will collect 500,000 U.S. dollars,
with the losing finalist getting 250,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded team of Americans Lindsay Davenport and Mary
Joe Fernandez won the doubles title Saturday, defeating the
top-seeded pair of Novotna and Spaniard Arantxa Sanchez Vicario
6-3, 6-2.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela's International Reserves Recover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Total Venezuelan international
monetary reserves reached 15.12 billion U.S. dollars as of
November 18, recovering from the slump state of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) said in a document that the
total reserves increased by a big margin of 5.39 billion dollars
during the first 10 months of this year.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the number could reach 16 billion dollars
by the end of this year, 60 percent more than that at the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The recovery is attributed to the rise of Venezuelan oil prices
in the international market and foreign capitals that went into
the country.
</P>
<P>
The international reserves of Venezuela dropped drastically in
1994 and 1995 as the result of a grave economic crisis, reaching
the lowest point of 9.723 dollars at the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ban On Illegal Finance Activities (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 24 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council, the top
administrative body, recently issued a circular on halting illegal
financial activities and said that four banking institutions have
been closed.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, from June 1994 to March 1995, the
restructuring committee of Lanxi City in east China's Zhejiang
Province, without authorization, approved the three local
financing companies and the city's industrial and commercial
administration allowed them to become involved in banking.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, was not informed
of the establishment of the three companies: Lanxi City Lanjiang
Service of Nongovernment Financed Funds, Lanxi City Lanjia Service
on Nongovernment Financed Funds, and Lanxi City Workers' Financing
Service.
</P>
<P>
The three companies did business by providing interest rates
that were 50 percent higher than official rates on deposits, and
loaned money to others at rates that were 90 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March this year, the three companies had over 97
million yuan in loans, 20 percent of which were outstanding.
</P>
<P>
From May 20 to early June, there was a run on the banks by
depositors when they discovered that it would be difficult for the
"banks" to recover their loans and to pay customers because of
poor management.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has criticized the city government
departments, and those who are found guilty will be punished in
accordance with criminal code. The director of Lanxi Branch of
the People's Bank of China has been removed for failing to perform
the duty of supervision and management, and the director of the
Jinhua Branch of the bank has been given a punishment of recording
a demerit. The Lanxi branch comes within the jurisdiction of the
Jinhua branch.

<P>
A similar case in southwest China's Sichuan Province involved
the Mutual Assistance Common Fund of Departments Directly Under
the provincial government, which was illegally established by the
Trade Union of Departments Directly Under the Provincial
Government.
</P>
<P>
The fund was involved in unlawful banking activities, accepting
funds from grass-roots trade unions and individuals and lending
the money out in the forms of mortgage loans and credit. In June
of 1992, it changed its name to the Work Mutual Assistance Fund
of the Trade Union of Departments Directly Under the Provincial
Government and the fund was enlarged and the interest rate raised,
and banks were entrusted by the fund to lend its funds to
enterprises and individuals at an annual interest of 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August this year, the fund had accumulated 500
million yuan in debt and when fund officials were arrested for
suspected economic crimes, depositors asked for their money.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was brought under control when the People's Bank of
China and provincial government departments took a series of
emergency steps.
</P>
<P>
The case is still under investigation by the People's Bank of
China and the provincial government. Individuals responsible are
under investigation and those who are found guilty will be
punished in accordance with the criminal code.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Steffi Graf is to
meet Martina Hingis of Switzerland Sunday in the title match of
the WTA Tour Chase Championship singles in New York after they won
over Jana Novotna and Iva Majoli, respectively Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Graf ended Novotna's winning streak at 14 matches and three
tournament titles in a two-hour thrilling semifinals of the season
ending WTA Championships.
</P>
<P>
Graf, five-time champion of this event, had to rally for a
first set loss to clinch the 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 decision. Graf also
overcame a back problems which six days earlier forced her to
retire against Novotna while serving for the first set of the
final in the Philadelphia tune-up for this tournament.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Hingis gained the final berth with a 6-2, 4-6,
6-1 triumph over Iva Majoli of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Graf is the top seed and Hingis No. 7 but the defending
champion recognized that this was a highly anticipated match-up
because of Hingis's rocket-like progress in the tournament for the
16-top women plaers in the world.
</P>
<P>
Graf lost to Hingis at the Italian Open in May but since then
has built a 4-1 record head-to-head.

<HEADLINE> AL Slams Israeli Settlement Project on Golan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) today
lashed out at the Israeli government's decision to erect three
new settlements on the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau Israel
captured from Syria during the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
AL Assistant Secretary General for Arab Affairs Ambassador
Ahmed Ben Heliy said the decision came within the framework of
the escalating campaign staged by the Israeli Likud government to
create more tension and undermine the entire peace process.
</P>
<P>
Heliy, who is in charge of the Golan file, said these
practices display Israel's attempt to wriggle out of its
commitments to the peace process including U.N. Security Council
resolutions 242 and 338, and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
These practices flagrantly violate the fourth Geneva
Convention of 1949 and the U.N. Security Council resolutions on
the Golan, which consider any measures taken by Israel in this
occupied land as null and void, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has taken the first step toward building 900 new
housing units for Jews on the occupied Golan Heights in a move
sure to anger Syria. The units comprise three new settlements.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said Friday that the units are part of a
project by Golan settlers to build 2,500 more homes for Israelis
on the Golan by 2000. Some 15,000 Jews and 18,000 Druze currently
live on the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Syria and the Jewish state have been on the
rise since a right-wing government took office in Israel in June.
</P>
<P>
The AL official said that the world community has become aware
of the danger of these Israeli measures which threaten to thwart
the peace process and underline its unwillingness to co-exist
with its Arab neighbors in peace.
</P>
<P>
The world community must be determined to put an end to these
practices, he concluded.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros Ghali Friday recommended another six-month renewal, until
May 31, 1997, of the 1,040-member U.N. force which has served as
a buffer between the Syrian and Israeli armies on the Golan
heights since 1974.

CAIRO, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Two unidentified militants were
killed today by Egyptian security agents in a manhunt on a train
bound here from southern Egypt, according to the Egyptian Middle
East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The two men first aroused the suspicion of policemen who
spotted an automatic rifle hidden under the clothes of one of
them. As the policemen were approaching for identification, the
two men tried to open fire but they were gunned down immediately.

</P>
<P>
The unidentified number of assailants fled the scene in their
car after trading fires with the police.
</P>
<P>
The militants have waged a violent campaign against the
government since 1992 in an attempt to install Islamic rule in the
country. At least 1,050 people have died in the violence.

<HEADLINE> 360 Liberian Militiamen Turn in Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- About 360 combatants across
Liberia on Friday turned in arms to the west African peacekeeping
force known as ECOMOG, to kick off the program aimed at disarming
some 60,000 militiamen in the country.
</P>
<P>
A total of 196 fighters surrendered 196 weapons at the
Hinterland Camp Naama, a major base of the militia National
Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), led by Charles Taylor, the
warlord who ignited the civil war on December 24, 1989, the
United Nations sources said today in Monrovia, capital of
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"Sixty-two fighters, including 13 child fighters and two
female combatants, were disarmed and demobilized" in Tubmanburg
stronghold of Roosevelt Johnson, leader of the Krahn wing to the
United Liberation Movement (ULIMO-J), according to a press
statement from the UN Humanitarian Assistance Coordination Office
in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
The collected weapons included rocket propelled grenades,
rocket launchers and 600mm guns.
</P>
<P>
Johnson "was personally on the ground supervising the
disarmament of his fighters," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
At Monrovia's suburban camp Schiefflin Barracks hosting the
first battalion of the armed forces of Liberia (AFL), a total of
54 combatants, including one child soldier, turned in 38 usable
and 16 unusable weapons to the ECOMOG on Friday when the
disarmament of demobilization process began.
</P>
<P>
In Monrovia, 47 combatants, including 15 child soldiers,
turned in 30 usable and 17 unusable weapons, and were disarmed
and registered for demobilization at the disarmament center near
the Barclay Training Center, a downtown military barracks hosting
AFL soldiers and militiamen belonging to Krahn factions.
</P>
<P>
But the UN statement said more than 400 fighters who turned
out for disarmament in Kakata, 35 km northeast of Monrovia, "were
turned away because preparations had not yet been completed for
the process at that site."
</P>
<P>
At Bo Waterside and Voinjama in western Liberia, according to
the statement, the process was "stalled by an alleged lack of
instructions to the fighters by the leadership of Mandingo
militiamen, or ULIMO-K loyal to Alhaji Kromah.
</P>
<P>
However, it said contacts have been made with the ULIMO-K
command "to notify their fighters about the situation, and
expectations are high that the process would gather momentum
today."
</P>
<P>
Although various logistical teething problems delayed the
disarmament exercise on Friday, field reports from around the
country indicate a high turn-out as well as an impressive display
of morale and discipline among the fighters queuing up for
disarmament, the statement said.

BAGHDAD, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Rolf Ekeus, Chairman of the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) charged with eliminating Iraq's
mass-destruction weapons, will visit Iraq on December 9, UNSCOM
sources in Baghdad announced today.
</P>
<P>
During his coming four-day visit to Iraq, Ekeus will examine

The UNSCOM wanted to carry those pieces of Scud missile to its
laboratory in the U.S. in a bid to know how many missiles of
this type have been destroyed by Iraq and if Baghdad still
possesses a number of those missiles, the sources explained.
</P>
<P>
The sources described Ekeus' coming visit to Iraq as
"extremely important." They also said that the current visit of
Ekeus' deputy, Charles Doliver, to Baghdad is intended to make
preparations for Ekeus' coming visit to Iraq, and to make certain
that the monitoring system currently applied by the U.N. to
Iraq's arsenal is operating well.

<HEADLINE> Prominent French Writer Entombed in Pantheon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The remains of Andre Malraux,
the prominent French writer, thinker, resistance fighter and
minister of culture of General Charles de Gaulle, was moved into
the Pantheon in Paris at a solemn ceremony this evening.
</P>
<P>
He thus became the fifth French writer to be entombed in the
necropolis after Francois Marie Arouet Voltaire, Jean-Jacques
Rousseau, Victor Hugo and Emile Zola.
</P>
<P>
Malraux also followed Jean Moulin, the legendary resistance
leader during World War II who died of tortures in his captivity
in Germany in 1943, to represent one generation of resistance
fighters against Nazi Germany in the Pantheon.
</P>
<P>
In a 30-minute speech in memory of the man of letters,
President Jacques Chirac praised Malraux for his support to and
sympathy with the Chinese Revolution as were reflected in his
works such as "Les Conquerants" and "La Condition Humaine," both
of them about the workers' uprisings in the 1920s in Guangdong and
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also highly evaluated Malraux's participation in the
Spanish Civil War in 1936 fighting on the Republican side against
the Franco fascist forces supported by fascist Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
"France, as you (Malraux) said, is never greater than when it
is open to all the world, when it is not restricted to itself,"
said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The coffin of Malraux was carried by six soldiers of the
Republican Guard, and was accompanied by Chirac, the widow of
Malraux, Madelaine, and Malraux's family members into the central
hall of the temple.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony fell on the 20th anniversary of the death of
Malraux.

<HEADLINE> Republicans to Continue Moving to Right in 105th </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The 105th Congress will
continue moving U.S. society to the right by stepping up its
overhaul of welfare, improving campaign finance rules and working
to reduce juvenile crime and drug use, Majority Leader of the U.S.
House of Representatives Dick Armey said today.
</P>
<P>
In the republican weekly radio address, Armey predicted that
when Congress reconvenes in January, the two parties won't discuss
whether to implement conservative ideas, just how.
</P>
<P>
"There won't be any debate over whether to balance the budget,
only over how and when to do it," Armey said. "And there will no
longer be any debate over whether to replace socially harmful
welfare programs with a new emphasis on work and responsibility --
only debate over the best ways to end the cycle of dependency."
</P>
<P>
Americans have elected a Democratic president and a Republican
Congress that ran on conservative platforms of "smaller
government, lower taxes, a balanced budget, saving Medicare,
improving education and cleaning up our environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton focused his weekly radio address on
Thanksgiving and his trip to the Asia-Pacific region to join
leaders of 17 nations in the Philippines for an economic
conference.
</P>
<P>
The president also called on Americans to think of the poor as
they sit down to Thanksgiving dinners this week.
</P>
<P>
Too much food goes to waste in restaurants, cafeterias and
grocery stores across the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today we are taking two more steps to help fight hunger,"
Clinton said.
