GOP Warned on China Trade Bill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The administration's point man on China bluntly warned
Republicans on Thursday that they will have to accept a human rights monitoring
panel to win passage of landmark trade legislation. Commerce Secretary William
Daley said he believed that chances for congressional approval of permanent
normal trade relations with China were ''slim to none'' without legislation to
create a congressional-executive commission to monitor China's human rights
performance. Meanwhile, President Clinton warned members of his own party that
Democrats would be hurt if their opposition killed the legislation.

Fire Sweeps Through Los Alamos, N.M.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Driven by swirling wind of up 55 mph, fire rolled
from block to block in abandoned Los Alamos Thursday, burning scores of homes
down to their foundations in the town where the atomic bomb was built.
Firefighters rushed to save houses as orange flames and billowing smoke rose
over the town. Whole neighborhoods were reduced to ruins, with everything from
trailers to mansions going up in smoke in a blaze that had been set by the
government to clear away brush in the wilderness but raged out of control over
the weekend.

GOP Weighs Primary Schedule Changes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Republicans who believe their states were practically
shut out of the presidential nominating process are backing a proposal to let
smaller states vote first in early March, with clusters of larger states voting
later through June. But representatives of some of those big states, including
California, Florida, Illinois and Texas, opposed the plan, debated Thursday by
the Republican National Committee's rules panel. A vote was expected Friday,
when the RNC's state chairmen's meeting reconvenes.

Bush Pulls Even With Gore Among Women
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George Bush has pulled even with Al Gore in women's
support, helping the Republican edge ahead in a broader survey of likely
presidential voters. Americans say they also feel Bush is more charismatic, has
a better sense of humor and is more inspiring. On the other hand, people in the
new polling said they find Gore, the Democratic vice president, more attractive
and more caring about people. Campaign polls out Thursday suggested that Bush,
the Texas governor, has largely recovered from his slump in the polls in March
and has made gains among several key voter groups.

Review of Miami Mayor Charges Ordered
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Gov. Jeb Bush assigned a special prosecutor
Thursday to review the flury of accusations made by Miami Mayor Joe Carollo and
the former city manager in the aftermath of the Elian Gonzalez raid. State
Attorney Bernie McCabe, who works in Pinellas and Pasco counties, was assigned
to review whether criminal charges should be brought regarding allegations made
by former Miami City Manager Donald Warshaw and Carollo. Carollo fired Warshaw
days after Warshaw refused to fire former Police Chief William O'Brien, who was
alerted to the April 22 federal raid but did not inform the mayor. O'Brien later
resigned.

Denver Newspapers Joining Forces

<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Denver's two newspapers announced plans Thursday to form a
joint operating company, acknowledging their bitter yet colorful competition
eventually would have forced one of them out of business. Under the proposal,
The Denver Post and the Denver Rocky Mountain News would maintain separate news
operations but would equally share business functions, including advertising and
circulation sales, production and newspaper distribution.

   TOKYO (AP) -- A rally on Wall Street helped Tokyo stocks rebound somewhat
early Friday from the previous day's plunge. The Nikkei gained 344.75 points to
17,227.21 in the first 30 minutes of trading. In New York, the Nasdaq rose
114.85 points to 3,499.58 at Thursday's finish. The Dow climbed 178.19 points to

Mets Defeat Pirates 3-2
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The New York Mets remained unbeaten with Al Leiter on the
mound, getting an eight-hitter from the left-hander and a solo homer and two
RBIs from Todd Zeile to beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 3-2 Thursday night. Leiter
(4-0) struck out eight as the Mets improved to 7-0 when he starts this season.
The Pirates had won four of five and had scored at least 11 runs in each of
their last three victories, including a 13-9 decision Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Denver's two newspapers announced plans Thursday
to form a joint operating company, acknowledging their bitter yet
colorful competition eventually would have forced one of them out
of business.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, The Denver Post and the Denver Rocky
Mountain News would maintain separate news operations but would
equally share business functions, including advertising and
circulation sales, production and newspaper distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ''The News and The Post have been waging a battle for
circulation and ad revenue unlike any other,'' said Ken Lowe,
president and chief operating officer of E.W. Scripps Co., which
owns the News. ''We've done everything we know to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite our best efforts, the reality of two-newspaper
economics today dictates that we take another tack.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, the News has lost $123 million, compared with a $200
million profit for the Post, the newspapers said. The Post is owned
by MediaNews Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The News planned to apply Friday for a joint operating agreement
because it is ''in probable danger of financial failure,'' said
Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   Under the federal Newspaper Preservation Act, the attorney
general can grant antitrust law exemptions to allow financially
troubled newspapers to merge their production and commercial
operations.
</P>
<P>
   William Dean Singleton, MediaNews chairman and chief executive,
said the newspapers are also facing stiff competition from a
multitude of sources, ranging from television to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just a newspaper battle anymore,'' Singleton said.
''It's newspapers battling the rest of the communications
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than 100 years, the two newspapers have fought for turf
in one of the longest-running newspaper wars in the country. Only a
handful of major cities still have competing newspapers, including
Los Angeles and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Both are morning papers. The Post switched from an afternoon
paper in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The News has a daily circulation of 446,465 and a Sunday
circulation of 552,085. The Post's daily circulation is 413,730 and
its Sunday circulation is 558,560.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, each paper would publish separate morning
editions Monday through Friday. Weekend editions would be published
under a joint masthead, with the News publishing on Saturday and
the Post publishing on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Post and the News would form the Denver Newspaper Agency to
handle the joint operations. Executives said they did not expect
job cuts in the newsrooms, but cuts are possible in other areas.
The News has 1,785 employees, while the Post has 1,870.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1859, the News won readers early on with headlines
like ''The Utes Must Go,'' referring to American Indians. It also
defended military raids on Indian camps.
</P>
<P>
   The Post, founded in 1892, took the circulation lead at the turn
of the century ''with its buckets of blood'' campaign, using
screaming banner headlines in red ink like ''Does it hurt to be
born?'' said Tom Noel, University of Colorado-Denver history
professor.
</P>
<P>
   The battle waged throughout Colorado's economic booms and busts,
heating to a boiling point in the 1990s, when both papers offered
subscriptions at ridiculously low costs. The News has sold
subscriptions for a penny a day.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the News withdrew from its statewide circulation to
focus on counties along the Front Range, encompassing metropolitan
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ''That competition has not occurred in a vacuum and, over the
last few years, we found ourselves battling for both market share
and mind share,'' Singleton said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, each newspaper received a Pulitzer Prize for
coverage of the April 1999 Columbine High School shooting attack.

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) -- Within the old stone walls of San
Fernando Cathedral, sightseers mingle with Roman Catholic
worshippers as a priest celebrates Mass in Spanish and English.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly woman prays. A smiling young couple clad in shorts
gazes up at antique stained-glass windows. Tourists peer at plaques
marking the burial place of the purported remains of Alamo
defenders.
</P>
<P>
   This is San Fernando, a busy, historic church and lately the
focus of a heated battle involving a $15 million plan that would
change the interior of the 262-year-old structure.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it's a clash over historic preservation. At its
foundation, it's an intense feud over religious rites.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are fighting on two fronts,'' said Edmundo Vargas, one of
the most outspoken opponents of the plan. ''We have based ourselves
on what is correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas is president of Defenders of the Magisterium. The
organization -- whose name ''magisterium'' refers to the teaching
authority of the pope and Catholic bishops -- contends some changes
proposed will diminish the reverence traditionally expected of
Catholic worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   The group is circulating petitions opposing what it calls the
''renovation'' of San Fernando and its use for interfaith services
and for such non-religious events as flamenco dance performances.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas is not a parishioner at San Fernando but says he has the
right to speak out. ''We don't need permission to defend the
faith,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials say that proposals such as moving the altar
forward 20 feet and placing seating on each side of it to provide
better views of the priest will improve participation in the
services.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand that people are nervous about change, especially
something that's old,'' said the cathedral's rector, the Rev. David
Garcia. ''We know we're not going to satisfy everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Garcia said, he has found that most parishioners
approve of the plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that they just fix it. It would be nice,'' said Lucy
Ortega, 69, as she left a noon Mass. ''It's a beautiful church.''
</P>
<P>
   San Fernando Cathedral is familiar to Catholics far beyond
Texas. A bilingual Mass at the church each Sunday is beamed via
satellite to television viewers from Alaska to Argentina. In 1987,
Pope John Paul II visited the cathedral during his visit to San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Though the cathedral seats only about 600, it often overflows.
More than 5,200 people attended the seven Sunday Masses on one
recent Sunday; 1,387 were at the popular noon Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal won't expand seating but should provide for more
standing room, Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the historic architecture of the cathedral -- from the
Spanish colonial dome at the front of church dating to 1738 to the
intricate, faded designs on the 19th-century ceiling above the pews
-- will be preserved and restored, Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is such a venerable institution in San Antonio. This is
the heart of our city,'' he said. ''As long as we respect that
history, respect that tradition, respect this beautiful, venerable
building, I think that's our goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also calls for stabilizing the church's foundation;
installing state-of-the-art lighting and acoustics; replacing pews
and flooring that were added in earlier restorations; installing
three hand-carved Mexican-style wooden retablos, or altar pieces;
restoring the historic baptismal font and moving it to the church's
main door; and refurbishing the old pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   Other plans involve replacing the existing rectory building next
door and building a community center nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The front -- and oldest -- part of San Fernando Cathedral was
built by Spanish immigrants from the Canary Islands at what was
then the geographic center of town. The nave, where worshippers
sit, was built in French Gothic Revival style beginning in 1868.	   One proposal
suggests reconfiguring a huge pipe organ installed
in 1884 so that an eastward-facing stained-glass rose window behind
it can be seen.
</P>
<P>
   The overall plan has prompted a steady stream of letters to the
San Antonio Express-News.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like a traditional church that reminds me of the beliefs I
was taught as a child, the unchangeable truths of my faith,'' wrote
opponent Belia Borrego Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Wilson, another letter writer, said: ''Is there anyone
in this city who can stop the changing of the cathedral? If there
is, please do so quickly. They are about to ruin the old and the
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's historic commission would have to approve any
proposals to modify the cathedral's exterior, said Genie Cooper, a
senior city planner.
</P>
<P>
   Most plans involve the interior. However, for safety reason, the
church may seek permission for another outside door.
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese became embroiled six years ago in a different
type of preservation fight with the nearby city of Boerne over
plans to tear down and replace part of St. Peter's Catholic Church,
built in 1923 and located partly in a historic district.
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese sued the city of Boerne, citing protection under
the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act. The U.S. Supreme Court
ultimately ruled in favor of the city, striking down the 1993 law.
The church and the city reached a compromise, and the church
renovation proceeded.
</P>
<P>
   The church so far has raised about $4 million for the San
Antonio project. Work is not expected to begin for at least 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Garcia said he continues to inform skeptics
about details of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''God bless them,'' he said. ''I'll give them all the
information they want. And if they still disagree with it, God
bless them.''

<HEADLINE> Mexican Opposition Candidate Leads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- For the first time, a major poll released
Thursday placed an opposition candidate for president ahead of the
party that has governed Mexico for 71 years, although the lead was
small enough to be a statistical tie.
</P>
<P>
   With the July 2 election less than two months away, the survey
showed Vicente Fox of the center-right National Action Party
favored by 46.3 percent of those polled, while Francisco Labastida
of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party was favored by 41.6
percent. That would put the result within the 3.2 percent margin of
error.
</P>
<P>
   ''If these numbers hold, Mexico is headed for a major change,''
pollster John Zogby said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   His company Zogby International carried out the survey for the
Reuters news agency. The survey conducted personal interviews of
1,062 likely voters between April 29 and May 7.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing far behind was Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the left-center
Democratic Revolution Party, who was supported by 9.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most Mexicans have never known a president who was not a member
of the governing party, known as the PRI. It has run Mexico since
its creation as a tool of the presidency in 1929, and although it
has long since severed formal ties to the government, it remains
the dominant political force in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's momentum got another boost Thursday when a minor-party
candidate called on all five opposition groups to form a united
front against the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   But Porfirio Munoz Ledo of the tiny Authentic Party of the
Mexican Revolution stopped short of endorsing Fox, with whom he met
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz Ledo called for an ''alliance of candidates committed to
democratic transition.'' It is too late by law for the parties to
join a true coalition, but they can informally endorse one of the
front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Interior Ministry publicly accused Munoz Ledo
of trying to take over the leadership of the party he represents.
Munoz Ledo called it a dirty trick designed to destabilize his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, the leader of the party, Carlos Guzman, said
Munoz Ledo no longer had the support of the Authentic Party. Guzman
asked him to resign as candidate, but by law cannot force him to.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz Ledo is a former president both of the PRI and of the
Democratic Revolution Party.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Zogby survey, the Labastida campaign released
its own poll Thursday showing the PRI candidate comfortably ahead
with 45 percent of the vote, while Fox received 39 percent and
Cardenas had 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted by the Pearson polling firm of Mexico,
surveyed 1,590 potential voters between April 28 and May 2 and had
a margin of error of 2.8 percentage points, Pearson president
Manuel Barberena said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Barberena said the poll was conducted in 150 municipalities in
almost every state of the country. Javier Trevino, a top official
in the Labastida campaign, said the Zogby poll was overly
concentrated in the cities.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters said support for Fox was highest in the cities, but
insisted the poll was weighted to account for that.
</P>
<P>
   The Zogby poll was the first report by a major polling
organization to appear since a nationally televised debate between
presidential candidates on April 25. Less reliable telephone
surveys after that event showed many voters felt Fox won that
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five percent of those who answered the Zogby-Reuters poll
said they had seen the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 15 percent of those polled -- including those who didn't
watch the debate -- said they thought Fox had won the debate, the
highest figure for any of the six candidates who took part. About 8
percent said Labastida had won.
</P>
<P>
   Fox had been surging even before the debate. A poll published a
day before the debate in the newspaper Reforma showed Labastida
only 3 percentage points ahead. That poll had a 2.5 percent margin
of error.
</P>
<P>
   Reforma's next poll is not due to appear for more than a week.

<HEADLINE> Navy Medic Pleads Guilty to Murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. (AP) -- A Navy medic admitted Thursday
that he killed his wife after an argument and conspired with his
former girlfriend to conceal her death.
</P>
<P>
   Petty Officer 2nd Class David Tate pleaded guilty during a court
martial at Camp Pendleton. He faces a military prison sentence of
at least 20 years when he is sentenced June 12.
</P>
<P>
   Tate testified that he and his wife, Cynthia, got into a shoving
match at their Camp Pendleton home the night of Feb. 13, 1999. Tate
said he took a gun from her, shot her and then hid her body in a
sewage drain.
</P>
<P>
   Tate was accused of conspiring with his former girlfriend, Petty
Officer 3rd Class Andrea Bart, to cover up the killing.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded guilty to, among other charges, premeditated murder,
adultery, and conspiracy to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   Following the slaying, Tate, of Colorado Springs, Colo.,
reported his wife missing and told investigators that she had left
a note saying she was going to Las Vegas with friends.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, Tate attended a prayer vigil in a base chapel, and
in media interviews appealed for help in finding his missing wife.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a tip, Navy investigators discovered Cynthia Tate's
body in July near a reservoir on the base, 30 miles north of San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Tate and Bart, of Midlothian, Va., were Navy medics assigned to
the Headquarters and Service Battalion, 1st Force Service Support
Group at the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps said Bart, 28, is expected to plead guilty to
offenses related to the slaying when her case is heard May 23.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Rebels Close on Jaffna  </HEADLINE>
By KRISHNAN GURUSWAMY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Tamil Tiger rebels said Friday they were
closing in on Jaffna city, while Sri Lankan jets stepped up bombing
sorties on rebel positions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sri Lankan soldiers! You are occupying our land,'' said a
Voice of Tigers rebel radio broadcast Thursday. ''Our cadres are
advancing. We will capture Jaffna. You must surrender or
withdraw.''
</P>
<P>
   Sustained bombing by the Sri Lankan air force on the rebels'
backup units is seen as delaying their final march into the city.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast, listened to by residents in the northern town of
Vavuniya reached by telephone, said Friday that the rebels captured
Nedunkulam area, which is only half a mile from the administrative
center of the city. The radio said rebels can march into the city
center any moment.
</P>
<P>
   The radio said Thursday that the rebels had captured four other
towns located from half a mile to four miles away.
</P>
<P>
   It was the closest to Jaffna that the guerrillas have reached
since they lost their former capital in the north to the military
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, or LTTE, said they killed
many soldiers and that several hundred civilians fled the embattled
areas. The radio said the rebels lost 13 fighters in the past 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   There was no Sri Lankan government statement on the latest
situation in the north. But the government's chief spokesman and
censor, Ariya Rubasinghe, said ''troops continue to offer stiff
resistance displaying firm determination to destroy the
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The contradictory claims could not be independently verified
because neither side allows journalists into the battle zone.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross urged
the warring parties to ensure that civilians and their property are
protected.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, after fierce assaults, the rebels said they had
seized a vital bridge three miles outside Jaffna, which would bring
the city's only airport within range of their guns and block a
major exit route for the defenders. The government denied the rebel
claim.
</P>
<P>
   For the second day in a row, the government raised taxes to
bring in additional money for defense.
</P>
<P>
   It also banned live broadcast of news and current affairs
programs about national security. Censorship is already in force in
Sri Lanka on all news organizations operating in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Four days ago, the government rejected the offer by the Tigers
to a temporary cease-fire to allow the 40,000 troops to surrender
Jaffna Peninsula, home to most of the 3.2 million Tamil minority.
</P>
<P>
   The next day the rebels began to push toward the government line
on several fronts. The fighting has left more than 100 people dead
this week, according to government and rebel reports.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels want to carve out a homeland in the north and the
east of the country where they say the Tamils will not face
discrimination from the majority Sinhalese.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the terrorists are making desperate attempts to
advance further, troops are determined and, so far, all such
attempts have been repulsed,'' spokesman Rubasinghe's statement
said.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 11, Orioles 4  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Emergency replacement Andy Sheets drove in the
go-ahead run with his first hit of the season during a six-run
sixth inning that lifted the Boston Red Sox to an 11-4 victory over
the Baltimore Orioles on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett, who entered the game in a 2-for-14 slump, went
3-for-5 with a homer and four RBIs. He leads the Red Sox with 12
homers and 33 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Boston shortstop Nomar Garciaparra was replaced by Sheets in the
first inning after aggravating a hamstring injury while running out
a grounder. Garciaparra missed two games last weekend with a tight
left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Brady Anderson homered and drove in three runs for the Orioles,
who have lost eight of nine. Baltimore is 5-13 since opening the
season 11-5.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 4-4, Trot Nixon opened the sixth with a double
off Jose Mercedes (2-2) and took third on a groundout. Sheets then
snapped an 0-for-16 skid with a single past a drawn-in infield.
</P>
<P>
   Everett followed with a 429-foot shot to right, the 25th homer
in the nine-year history of Camden Yards to land on Eutaw Street.
Wilton Veras added a two-run double off B.J. Ryan and scored on a
wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Everett made it 11-4 in the seventh with a run-scoring grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Rheal Cormier (1-0) pitched 2 1-3 innings of hitless relief
after replacing Tim Wakefield, who became the first Boston pitcher
since Vaughn Eschelman in 1996 to start a game after pitching in
relief the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore starter Pat Rapp, who spent last season with Boston,
allowed four runs, seven hits and four walks in 3 1-3 innings. He
left with the Orioles down 4-1, but managed to avoid a third
straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox scored twice in the first inning on a run-scoring
grounder by Garciaparra and an RBI single by Everett. Anderson led
off the bottom half with his fifth homer.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanley drew a bases-loaded walk in the third, and Brian
Daubach chased Rapp with an RBI single in the fourth. Cal Ripken
hit his seventh homer leading off the Orioles' half, and Anderson
tied it with a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Home plate umpire Phil Cuzzi mistakenly called a three-ball
walk to B.J. Surhoff in the first inning. ... Anderson has homered
to lead off a game 38 times, second to only Rickey Henderson (75)
on the career list. ... Wakefield yielded seven runs, 10 hits and
three homers in his back-to-back appearances. ... Stanley went
0-for-3 and is mired in an 0-for-17 skid.

<HEADLINE> Indians 16, Royals 0  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Manny Ramirez's first-inning grand slam got
Cleveland rolling and Jaret Wright pitched 7 2-3 shutout innings
Thursday night, leading the Indians to a 16-0 thrashing of the
Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The shutout was Cleveland's most lopsided in 45 years, when the
Indians beat the Boston Red Sox 19-0 on May 18, 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez added a two-run homer in the sixth and David Justice and
Jim Thome hit solo shots as Cleveland took out some frustration
while snapping Kansas City's five-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a bewildering defeat in Minnesota on Wednesday night
in which they blew an 8-1 lead and lost 10-9, the Indians made sure
their first stay in third place in the AL Central since 1997 was a
short one.
</P>
<P>
   They bludgeoned Royals rookie starter Chad Durbin (1-2) for nine
runs in 1 1-3 innings and didn't let up against four relievers. The
Indians batted around in the second and sixth innings -- scoring
five runs in each -- and finished with a season-high 22 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alomar and Jolbert Cabrera both went 4-for-5 for the
Indians, who opened a 10-game homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Wright (3-2) won for the first time in five starts, allowing
four hits before being replaced by Steve Reed. Wright walked two
and struck out four before leaving with tightness in his right
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious to put the devastating loss to the Twins behind them,
the Indians came out swinging in the first against Durbin.
</P>
<P>
   Three straight singles loaded the bases for Ramirez, who hit an
0-1 pitch into the left-field bleachers for his ninth homer this
season and 11th career grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar's RBI single put the Indians up 5-0 in the
second, and again Ramirez came up with the bases full. But after
the first pitch, Kansas City catcher Jorge Fabregas tried to pick
Omar Vizquel off first, but overthrew the play allowing two runs to
score.
</P>
<P>
   Thome's run-scoring single made it 7-0 and chased Durbin. Richie
Sexson then greeted reliever Jason Rakers with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Justice led off the fourth inning with his sixth homer, and one
out later, Thome connected for his 10th.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians added five runs in the sixth on Ramirez's homer,
Cabrera's run-scoring hit and Vizquel's two-run single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Royals haven't won six in a row since June 1995. ...
Ramirez's slam was the Indians' first this season. It was his 17th
career two-homer game. ... After allowing one run in six innings to
win his first start this season at Toronto, Durbin has allowed 33
runs in 33 1-3 innings. ... The start of the game was delayed 47
minutes by rain. ... Ramirez and Thome have homered in the same
game 16 times since April 1999. The Indians are 14-2 in those
games. ... Indians outfielder Jacob Cruz had reconstructive surgery
on his left knee Thursday and will be out for the season. He was
injured while making a catch on April 29 against Boston.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter left Thursday
night's game against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays after the second
inning with an abdominal strain in his left side.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will probably be a few days,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre
said. ''I think we have to wait through the weekend and see how it
responds to treatment and then make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter appeared to injure himself with a leaping, twisting throw
to second on a ground ball hit by Vinny Castilla.
</P>
<P>
   ''I actually think it happened yesterday when he was doing some
hitting drills,'' Torre said. ''That was the first hint we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter has been mired in a slump and flied out in his only at-bat
to extend his hitless streak to 13 at bats over his last four
games.

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Brogna Breaks Left Wrist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Philadelphia first baseman Rico Brogna was
placed in the 15-day disabled list Thursday with a broken left
wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Brogna injured himself Wednesday when he was hit by a pitch from
Matt Blank in the ninth inning of the Phillies' 8-0 win over the
Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I got to the hospital and couldn't move it without it
hurting, I had a feeling it was broken,'' Brogna said. ''I still
hoped it wasn't, but I had that feeling. It was a different pain.
I've been hit before, but this was different.''
</P>
<P>
   Brogna returned to Philadelphia on Thursday with a cast on his
left arm that extended from his biceps to his hand. He will have
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's disappointing but right now there's nothing I can do but
wait until it heals,'' Brogna said. ''Hopefully I won't be out too
long so I can play a good portion of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury will likely sideline Brogna, 30, until the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's one of the best first basemen in the league,'' Phillies
manager Terry Francona said. ''I don't know if people realize it
but even when he's 0-for-4, he saves runs with his defense. And
that's really hard to replace.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Chris Pritchett was recalled from Triple-A
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in pretty good shape,'' Francona said. ''Brogna's one of
our best players. He's driven in 100 runs two years in a row and
his defense is as good as anybody's. He's an important part of our
team but we have guys -- Kevin Jordan filled in for Rolen last year
and Brian Hunter's here now, and Pritchett -- we'll just kind of mix
and match those guys and they'll do OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Francona said that calling up phenom Pat Burrell, who has been
playing left field for the Red Barons, wasn't an option at this
point.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to play some first in Triple-A now,'' Francona
said. ''But he's hitting .230. We all acknowledge he's going to be
a good player but bringing a kid before he's ready, that wouldn't
be a good move.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies have won five of seven to raise their record to
12-20. Brogna, hitting .246 and leading the team with 13 doubles,
was particularly disappointed with the timing of the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough because we were starting to get great pitching and
the hitting was coming around,'' Brogna said. ''In the upcoming
weeks I'll be around to encourage my teammates as much as
possible.''

<HEADLINE> Hermanson Assumes Closer's Role  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- With their bullpen wracked by injuries, the
Montreal Expos have given staff ace Dustin Hermanson the
responsibility of closing out their games.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted to know if I would be comfortable with it,'' said
Hermanson after he was approached by team officials to fill in for
injured closer Ugueth Urbina.
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson, who was scheduled to start Friday against Chicago's
Kerry Wood, was available out of the bullpen during Wednesday
night's 8-0 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they handled it well,'' Hermanson said. ''I thought it
wouldn't be a problem. I have the mentality of a closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Urbina, last year's NL saves leader with 41, will have an
arthrogram performed on his injured right elbow as soon as it can
be scheduled, possibly as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He felt pain in his right elbow after throwing his first pitch
while warming up during Tuesday night's 3-2 win. X-rays of the
elbow were taken the following day and an MRI was performed on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The MRI really was fairly clear,'' Expos general manager Jim
Beattie said following Thursday's 5-4 loss to the Phillies. ''They
didn't see much in there so he's going to be scheduled for an
arthrogram. Then based on that, it will tell us whether a surgical
procedure is necessary or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquired from Florida just before the beginning of the 1997
season, Hermanson was converted into a starter with Montreal. He
responded by going 14-11 with a 3.13 ERA in 1998. He led the staff
with 34 starts last season, despite going 9-14 with a 4.20 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson, who had no saves in 34 relief appearances with San
Diego from 1995-96, saved 21 games for Triple-A Las Vegas in 1996.
He has made 99 career starts, all with the Expos, and is 3-3 with a
4.81 ERA this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he is ready for it,'' Expos manager Felipe Alou said.
''He's set to go. He struggled his last two outings as a starter.
Whether the Urbina thing is serious or not, he's going to be
unavailable for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Urbina, 26, had bone chips removed from his right elbow in
December 1996 after experiencing pain while pitching in his native
Venezuela. He struck out the side while recording his eighth save
in his last outing, Sunday at Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The injury is the latest of a series that have plagued the
Expos' bullpen this season.
</P>
<P>
   Graeme Lloyd, signed as a free agent be to Montreal's setup man,
hasn't pitched this season. He had arthroscopic surgery on his left
shoulder May 4 and won't return for at least three months.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Strickland, the Expos' current setup man, also had an MRI
performed on his injured right shoulder Thursday, which detected a
torn labrum. Strickland will have arthroscopic surgery next
Wednesday and is not expected to return this season.
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson's move to the bullpen moves Mike Thurman's season
debut up to Friday. Tony Armas Jr. will be recalled from Triple-A
Ottawa to start on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the biggest thing is adjusting my routine again,''
Hermanson said. ''I have an idea about how the routine goes. I
won't do anything extra. I won't go out like an animal and blow
myself out right away.''

<HEADLINE> 4 Ex-Norfolk State Coaches Indicted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Four former Norfolk State coaches have been
indicted on forgery charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Circuit Court indictments, returned April 5, were based on
an investigation of alleged travel expense irregularities. Those
charged were former track coach Steven Earl Riddick; his assistant,
Simon N. Hodnett; former basketball coach Melvin L. Coleman; and
his assistant, Erik Tyrone Rashad.
</P>
<P>
   Riddick, a member of the 400-meter relay team that won a gold
medal in the 1976 Olympics, also was charged with misappropriation
of public funds.
</P>
<P>
   Riddick ran an Olympic training program at the university for
foreign athletes, but it ended in 1998 when Olympic officials
yanked funding and questioned Riddick's spending practices.
Athletes complained about inadequate housing and medical coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Riddick, 48, of Hampton, faces nine counts of forgery and one
count of misappropriation. Rashad, 37, of Tampa, Fla., faces nine
counts of forgery. Coleman, 57, of Weirton, W.Va., faces five
counts of forgery. Hodnett, 33, of Virginia Beach, faces five
counts of forgery.
</P>
<P>
   Neither prosecutors nor school officials would say how much
money was involved.

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes in Iowa Injure at Least 8  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNKERTON, Iowa (AP) -- A dozen tornadoes struck northeastern
Iowa late Thursday, injuring at least eight people, damaging
buildings and forcing the evacuation of a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   The tornadoes cut a swath of damage about 1{ miles wide
beginning just north of the Waterloo airport, through Dunkerton and
into Buchanan County, said Black Hawk County sheriff's Deputy Tony
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fortunately, it did not go through any densely populated
areas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly woman was in critical condition after a tornado
struck her home in Cedar Falls.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 tenants of a nursing home in Black Hawk County were
evacuated after its roof was heavily damaged. Up to seven suffered
minor injuries, said Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Police told the National Weather Service that a co-op elevator
was heavily damaged and a church roof was blown off in Dunkerton,
which is 120 miles northeast of Des Moines. A farmhouse was
destroyed as were seven outbuildings, and a storm spotter said two
houses were destroyed in town.
</P>
<P>
   The storms, which also produced hail and heavy rain, were moving
slowly to the east.

<HEADLINE> Lab Hazardous Materials Said Safe  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE KOIDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- With a massive wildfire out of control
in Los Alamos, federal officials sought to assure the public
Thursday that the storied nuclear laboratory at the heart of the
town is safe, with explosives and plutonium stored in fireproof
bunkers and vaults.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not an issue about national security or release of
radiation. That is not occurring,'' Sen. Jeff Bingaman said. ''The
lab is going to survive this in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The lab, however, did suffer some fire damage Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've lost a number of transportables,'' lab spokesman John
Gustafson said of trailers and portable buildings. ''No major
structures have been affected, and certainly none of them lost.''
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 buildings dot mesas and canyons on the
43-square-mile property. The location, 35 miles northwest of Santa
Fe, was chosen by physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer because of its
remoteness and isolation.
</P>
<P>
   This week, for the first time since it was established in 1943,
the lab was shut down by fire. Only emergency personnel continued
to work. The lab has about 7,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   All 11,000 people in the town of Los Alamos, an outgrowth of the
lab, and another 7,000 in suburban White Rock fled as wildfires
swept through the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Lab director John Browne said the blazes spread through an area
of the lab property where high explosives are stored in concrete
bunkers. And flames also jumped to within 300 yards of the
plutonium facility, said Kay Roybal, a spokeswoman for the lab.
</P>
<P>
   She added that firefighters kept the wildfires at bay by burning
nearby grasses to eliminate possible fuels, and that by afternoon
the flames had shifted.
</P>
<P>
   Gustafson said lab officials are monitoring air emissions for
radioactivity.
</P>
<P>
   ''They took preliminary measurements ... and all those numbers
showed results consistent with background readings from natural
sources of radioactivity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Rhoades, director of the lab's Bradbury Science Museum,
said the facilities are safer today than years ago; after a 1996
fire that charred 16,683 acres and reached the perimeter of the
lab's property, timber was removed from around structures and
firebreaks were constructed.
</P>
<P>
   He feels confident there is no way fire could reach into the
bunkers or vaults to ignite explosives or radioactive materials.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're designed to withstand for something like four to six
hours a fire burning right on top of the building,'' Rhoades said.
''It's like trying to light a steel ballbearing on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mello, executive director of the anti-nuclear Los Alamos
Study Group, said he does not fear a disaster but claimed
firefighters could inhale smoke tainted with chemicals. He said the
fire has swept over an area where uranium has been blown up in the
past and landed in the soil and trees.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not know whether toxic materials have been burned,''
Mello said. ''It's possible, it's even likely to some extent, but
it's not something to be panicked about.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos is one of three government nuclear weapons labs under
the Energy Department; it is managed by the University of
California. More than half of its $1.26 billion annual budget goes
toward nuclear weapons programs, with the rest dedicated to
research in environmental cleanup, alternative energy sources and
biomedical sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Los Alamos has been used to design, develop and
test America's nuclear warheads. The key defense mission now is to
maintain the nuclear weapons stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos also has been the focus of a security and espionage
controversy stemming from the apparent loss of nuclear warhead
secrets to China in the 1980s. A lab scientist was fired last year
after being suspected of mishandling nuclear weapons secrets. He
has pleaded innocent to federal charges.

<HEADLINE> Congressmen, financier, but no Pataki eyeing Senate race  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Amid speculation that Rudolph Giuliani may
scrap his Senate race against Hillary Clinton, potential Republican
alternatives, including at least two congressmen and a
near-billionaire, are waiting in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would seriously consider running,'' U.S. Rep. Peter King of
Long Island said Thursday. ''I've been making some phone calls and
doing some television appearances to get my name out there. If
there's some significant support, I'll definitely go.''
</P>
<P>
   King's fellow Long Island congressman, Rick Lazio, telephoned
state GOP Chairman William Powers.
</P>
<P>
   ''He asked if I would call him'' if Giuliani dropped out, Powers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a political adviser to Theodore Forstmann said the
Wall Street financier will also consider entering the race if the
New York City mayor gives it up. Forbes magazine estimated
Forstmann's net worth at $925 million.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Sue Kelly of Westchester County was mentioned as a
possible alternative, but showed little interest, while former
state Housing Commissioner Joseph Holland said ''it is something I
would seriously consider.''
</P>
<P>
   Not interested is Gov. George Pataki, insisted one of his top
political advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's already told everybody, no,'' Zenia Mucha said Thursday
when pressed on whether the governor might reconsider last week's
declaration that he wouldn't enter the race if Giuliani dropped
out. ''It's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, with polls indicating Pataki is by far the top
choice among Republicans to replace Giuliani and the strongest
candidate against Clinton, the governor will face pressure to
reconsider if GOP leaders need a new standardbearer.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is suffering from prostate cancer and announced
Wednesday that he and his wife are discussing a possible
separation.
</P>
<P>
   While Giuliani continued to say Thursday he had made no decision
yet about the race, a senior Republican official close to the
mayor, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Giuliani was
leaning toward quitting the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''His heart, his soul, his body are not in this thing,'' said
the official.
</P>
<P>
   State GOP leaders denied making contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Contrary to everybody else's popular belief, I believe he's
running,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our (state) convention is May 30,'' the state GOP chairman
added. ''I expect we'll come out of that convention with Rudy as
our candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, an early Giuliani
supporter who was worrying Tuesday that the mayor's marital woes
could hurt his Senate candidacy, said Thursday ''there are no plans
other than to support Rudy Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, one senior adviser to state GOP leaders, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said contingency planning was underway
with the likely replacement candidate being Lazio, who already has
more than $3 million in his campaign coffers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm kind of at peace about this,'' Lazio said in Washington.
''I feel as if this is the mayor's decision. If it is meant to be,
it will be obvious. And, if it is not meant to be, that will be
obvious as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio had, with Pataki's tacit approval, been pursuing the GOP
Senate nomination until August when the governor, under pressure
from national GOP leaders, threw his political muscle behind
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   King said Thursday that while he has only $600,000 in his
campaign account, whoever becomes the GOP candidate won't have to
worry much about money because of the anti-Hillary Clinton
sentiments nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann shouldn't have to worry about money. Forbes magazine's
latest list of the 400 richest Americans had him tied at No. 282.
His adviser, who asked not to be identified, said Fortsmann would
largely finance his own Senate campaign if he ran and that it would
focus on education issues.
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann, 59, senior partner of Forstmann, Little &AMP; Co., has
been an advocate of educational alternatives such as school
vouchers. He and John T. Walton, an heir to the Wal-Mart fortune,
founded the Children's Scholarship Fund in 1998. Last year, it gave
out $160 million in scholarships to 40,000 families so their
children could attend private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Holland, under a cloud of personal financial problems, resigned
as Pataki's housing commissioner in 1996. He was one of the
administration's highest-ranking black officials. He is now a
private-practice lawyer, consultant and motivational speaker.

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state's highest court has cautioned that
judges should not ''double count'' the value of professionals'
licenses when determining how to divide up the assets of divorcing
couples.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals made the admonition in a 6-0 ruling
Thursday that will be of intense interest to divorcing lawyers and
other licensed professionals in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The case before the judges concerned how the assets of lawyer
Harold Grunfeld and his wife Rochelle were divided when they
divorced in 1992 after 21 years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Rochelle Grunfeld, who stopped working as a teacher to raise the
couple's two children, was awarded half the value of the Park
Avenue law firm Harold Grunfeld founded, Grunfeld, Desiderio,
Lebowitz &AMP; Silverman. In addition to that asset, half of which was
valued at $1.29 million, Rochelle Grunfeld was also awarded $15,000
a month in alimony.
</P>
<P>
   A Supreme Court justice rejected Rochelle Grunfeld's attempt to
also get half the estimated value of her ex-husband's license to
practice law. But a midlevel appeals court later ruled that she was
indeed entitled to half the projected value of the license, winning
her another $773,500.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals said Rochelle Grunfeld was, in essence,
already collecting against the value of her ex's law license by
getting the $15,000 a month -- $180,000 a year -- in alimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''To the extent, then, that those same projected earnings used
to value the license also form the basis of an award of maintenance
(alimony), the licensed spouse is being twice charged with
distribution of the same marital asset value,'' the court said in a
ruling by Judge Howard Levine.
</P>
<P>
   The court sent the case back to the Supreme Court for a
recalculation of payments. It said Thursday it could not determine
how much of Harold Grunfeld's income came from sources other than
his law income, and it said the lower court should factor that into
the equation of how much he owes his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   Rochelle Grunfeld's lawyer Franklin Bonem said the ruling was a
good one overall for his client.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wish we could have gotten 100 percent, but we got close to
it,'' Bonem said. ''We couldn't be happier.''
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld's lawyer was out of the country Thursday and not
available to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The value of professional licenses in divorce matters are
determined by taking the average lifetime income of a college
graduate, comparing it with the higher average lifetime income of a
person licensed in a profession like the law or medicine, and
counting the difference as the value of the license. The age of the
people involved are also factored into the equation.
</P>
<P>
   In other rulings by the Court of Appeals Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   LEAD
</P>
<P>
   The court said the mother of a child in a lead paint poisoning
case should not have to undergo an IQ test to determine if
heredity, and not lead, caused defects in the child. However, the
court declined to issue a blanket rule saying IQ testing is
inappropriate in all such cases.
</P>
<P>
   CHAMPERTY
</P>
<P>
   The court reversed a lower court ruling which determined that
investors Bluebird Partners, L.P., improperly bought up tens of
millions of dollars in bonds issued by Continental Airlines after
the airline filed for bankruptcy protection in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Bluebird Partners sued United Jersey Bank for its conduct as
trustee for the airline bonds, saying the bank had violated its
fiduciary responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The bank countered that Bluebird Partners violated one of the
most venerable legal doctrines, namely one called ''champerty.''
''Champerty'' prohibits the buying and selling of rights in a law
suit, which United Jersey Bank said Bluebird Partners did by buying
the discounted Continental Airlines bonds with the intent of suing
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   But the Court of Appeals said it could not tell whether
champerty was committed by ''all this strategic jockeying and
financial positioning'' and it ordered a lower court to make that
determination.
</P>
<P>
   ''To say the least, a finding of champerty as a matter of law
might engender uncertainties in the free market system in
connection with untold numbers of sophisticated business
transactions,'' the court said, ''a not insignificant potentiality
in the state that harbors the financial capital of the world.''

<HEADLINE> Court decides mothers' IQ may be tested in some lead paint cases  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Landlords and municipalities fending off
certain lead paint lawsuits can require IQ tests of mothers to
determine whether lead-exposed children with mental problems are
victims of toxins or heredity, the state's highest court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   While deciding in favor of a Manhattan woman, saying she could
not be forced to take an intelligence exam, the Court of Appeals'
specified that it was not ruling out parental IQ testing in all
lead-poisoning cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each request must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis,''
Judge Carmen Beauchamp Ciparick wrote for the court. Five other
members of the panel concurred and Judge Joseph Bellacosa did not
take part in the ruling released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding to allow maternal IQ testing, the court rejected the
reasoning of a lower court which said the parents could not be
tested. The court cited New York's strong policy supporting open
disclosure and even said the woman's IQ was not confidential, just
not relevant or questionable in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ruling was against the landlord, it was seen as a
success for New York City and a powerful coalition of corporate and
insurance groups that sided with the apartment owner becauase it
did not deny IQ testing in other cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm heartened that the court left the door open,'' said
attorney Andrew Zajac, who filed a friend-of-the-court brief for
the Defense Association of New York. ''We think it's crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence examinations of mothers and other close relatives
are important to the city's defense in the 1,300 similar lead paint
claims it faces, it argued in a friend-of-the-court brief.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are gratified,'' said New York City counsel Margaret King.
''We would view this as a qualified victory.''
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the mother, Prudencia Andon, said she would now
move forward with her suit against 302-304 Mott Street Associates,
owner of the lower Manhattan apartment building where she lived.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Andon claimed her then 1-year-old son, Antonio, had
learning disabilities, delayed speech and language, and behavioral
problems because of lead paint in the apartment. The arguments over
the IQ test were brought up in pretrial motions.
</P>
<P>
   A state Supreme Court had ruled that an IQ test could be
administered. But the Appellate Division had reversed that ruling,
saying that the test would raise questions that would long delay
the case's resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Andon's attorney Alexander Wulwick had argued that forcing the
IQ test on the mother would ''extend to the hotly debated question
of whether and to what degree, IQ is inherited ... with each side
producing competing experts'' on nature vs. nurture.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ruling also agreed that the landlord's expert
witness, a doctor, did not offer enough evidence to support his
opinion that the mother's IQ was ''extremely relevant'' in this
case.
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Trial Lawyers Association had weighed in on
the case on behalf of the mother. That group did not return a call
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   About three-quarters of housing built before 1978 contains
lead-based paint, the Environmental Protection Agency says. If not
maintained, the federal agency said, the paint can lead, especially
in young children, to permanent brain, nervous system and kidney
damage.

<HEADLINE> Xerox Chief Thoman Fired  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Thirteen months after stepping down as
chief executive of Xerox, Paul A. Allaire is stepping back into the
job.
</P>
<P>
   The move was announced Thursday following the firing of CEO Rick
Thoman.
</P>
<P>
   Thoman, 55, a former chief financial officer at IBM, was hired
as the No. 2 executive at Xerox in June 1997. A cost-cutter who
helped reverse IBM's declining fortunes, he was seen as a leader
who could help Xerox regain its dominant position in the small and
large office machine markets.
</P>
<P>
   But since his arrival, Xerox has struggled with slumping sales
and a balky sales force restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Thoman was asked by members of the board of directors to resign,
a source familiar with Thursday's events told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox spokeswoman Christa Carone would not comment on Thoman's
departure. The company released a statement after the stock market
closed Thursday saying the board had accepted Thoman's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox said Allaire would take the job back on an interim basis.
He has also agreed to remain as chairman for two years, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   The board promoted Anne M. Mulcahy, a 24-year Xerox veteran who
is now president of the company's general markets division, to
president and chief operating officer, and nominated her for
election to the board to replace Thoman.
</P>
<P>
   Carone would not say whether Mulcahy is being groomed for the
CEO job. But she acknowledged that there is no search for a
permanent CEO and no successiarge of $625 million to
cover the restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Before extraordinary charges, Xerox had quarterly earnings of
$220 million, or 30 cents per share, down 36 percent compared with
$343 million, or 48 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenues in
the quarter rose 3 percent to $4.43 billion, up from $4.30 billion
in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox, best known for its copiers, has struggled against
Hewlett-Packard and Canon in the small and home-office markets.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts differed on whether Thoman was to blame for the
company's slide or whether he became the fall guy for problems that
started before he took over.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Enderlin, an analyst at Ryan, Beck-Southeast, said Thoman
made some good moves, including the acquisition of Tektronix Inc.'s
color printer division, rolling out new products and broadening
distribution channels. But he said Thoman's departure might be a
good move for the company.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to imagine things going worse for them at this
point,'' he said. ''Xerox has always had a sort of bureaucratic
culture and I think Thoman sort of imbedded that rather than trying
to overcome it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said Thoman was simply unable to overcome the company's
sluggishness in moving from an old-style copier company to a
digital business machines maker.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Kmetz, an analyst at IDC, a market research and consulting
firm in Framingham, Mass., said Thoman was clearly hired to make
Xerox a digital player, with digital copiers, printers,
multi-function fax machines and inkjet devices.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he had ideas on how to do that ... but obviously, it
didn't work out for the best,'' Kmetz said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the company seems to be correcting problems
associated with the realignment of its sales force along industry
lines rather than geographical boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no question that Xerox is going to rally from this at
some point down the road, but they've got a lot of work to do,''
Kmetz said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're playing in a market where their bread and butter has
been the copier world ... Now, it's a matter of organizing the
company so it can be lean and mean in the digital marketplace.''

<HEADLINE> Ford: SUVs Pose Hazards  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN HYDE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Ford Motor Co., in a startling admission, says
sport utility vehicles are environmentally unfriendly, chug gas and
can be a danger to drivers in smaller vehicles. The automaker also
said its high-profit business in SUVs doesn't always jibe with its
desire to be more environmentally responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The critical comments were delivered in a book given to
shareholders who attended Ford's annual meeting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a 98-page book, ''Connecting With Society,'' the company
concedes that SUVs burn more gas and emit more pollution than cars
and can pose a danger to smaller vehicles in crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Ford admits that ''with a few exceptions, its products are not
industry leaders in fuel economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The book even quotes a Sierra Club press release that ''the
gas-guzzling SUV is a rolling monument to environmental
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We take our social responsibility seriously,'' Ford chairman
William Clay Ford Jr. said after the meeting. ''Our approach to
SUVs and the environment has not always been responsible, but now
we're in the leading position.''
</P>
<P>
   The automaker's SUVs were the major engine behind the company's
record profits of $7.2 billion last year; some models can carry
profit margins of nearly $15,000. Demand for several models,
including the hulking Excursion, has almost outpaced supply.
</P>
<P>
   The automaker said the book was part of the company's effort to
be more ''transparent'' about the problems its facing and it's
proposed solutions. The book also promotes several environmentally
friendly steps made by the automaker, such as making its SUVs meet
low-emission standards and increasing the number of recyclable
parts.
</P>
<P>
   But William Clay Ford Jr. and Jac Nasser, the company's
president and CEO, said the company would continue to build and
market SUVs to meet customer demand. They said that if the
automaker limited its SUV sales in the name of environmental
concerns, competitors would simply pick up more customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're never going to please everybody,'' Ford said. ''But we
do pledge to work on it. ... Our customers love them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Nasser also said the company would announce changes
today at its Dagenham, England factory, which employs over 6,000
workers. They declined to give specifics, but said the company
would take a charge against earnings. Workers there have feared the
company would close its assembly operations, cutting thousands of
jobs.

<HEADLINE> Telergy going public to raise $250 million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Telergy Inc. has formally declared its
intention to raise $250 million in an initial public stock
offering, the first step toward becoming a public company.
</P>
<P>
   The stock offering is intended to provide the 5-year-old DeWitt
company with money to continue building its telecommunications
network, to expand its sales force and possibly to acquire other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Timing of the sale is uncertain, but it is expected this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Telergy is preparing for an IPO after two months of turbulence
in the stock markets that has resulted in many stocks losing value
and IPOs being postponed or canceled.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts think the long-term outlook for
telecommunications companies is generally strong, in part because
it provides the infrastructure for the growing Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   Telergy's preliminary prospectus, filed late Wednesday with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, did not indicate how many
shares the company will sell, or at what price. The document also
does not indicate what percentage of the company's total stock will
be represented by the IPO. Some 3.38 million shares have been
issued to employees and private investors.
</P>
<P>
   SEC rules forbid company officials from elaborating on their
written report to regulators. Details are expected to be submitted
in future documents.
</P>
<P>
   The document does not require Telergy to make the IPO final by
any particular date, or at all.
</P>
<P>
   Telergy was founded in 1995 by brothers Brian, Kevin and William
Kelly. By joining forces with utility companies -- first Niagara
Mohawk Power Corp., then others -- Telergy obtained rights to build
a fiber-optic network along the poles and underground transmission
routes controlled by the utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Telergy owns a network of fiber-optic cables and
telecommunications equipment that extends 1,800 miles in New York,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Washington, D.C. The company
uses its network to provide a wide array of services, from simple
voice calls to high-tech video streaming and data storage.
</P>
<P>
   After the IPO, Telergy plans to finish building its network by
the end of 2001. At that point, it will cover about 3,200 miles in
an area from Washington, D.C., to Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   According to the document filed Wednesday, each of the Kelly
brothers owns about 480,000 shares, or about 14 percent, of the
company's outstanding common stock.
</P>
<P>
   Other major individual shareholders include former Avis
executive and state Republican Party chairman J. Patrick Barrett,
the company president, who has an option to acquire 6.8 percent of
the outstanding shares, and director Frank Zaccanelli, a minority
owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, who has an option to acquire
4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other individual investors include John O'Mara, former state
Public Service Commission chairman, who serves as a director and
has options to acquire 30,000 shares of Telergy stock. Terence
McAuliffe, one of President Clinton's top fund-raisers, serves as a
director and owns or has warrants to acquire 12,728 shares.
</P>
<P>
   Opinac North America, a subsidiary of Niagara Mohawk, has
invested $40 million in Telergy and owns 13 percent of the stock
outstanding. Global Crossing also has invested $40 million, and
owns 14.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company lists assets of about $219.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Telergy had 1999 revenues of $7.9 million, and posted a net loss
of $62.9 million. Since its inception in 1995, the company has had
net losses of about $105.5 million, according to documents.

<HEADLINE> Henry Nicols remembered for his humor and his heroism  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- He spoke out about AIDS when few others
would. He touched millions with his courage. And he never stopped
smiling through all the ups and downs of his all-too-brief life.
</P>
<P>
   For the compassion, humor and grace that Henry Nicols
demonstrated in the face of tragedy, the Eagle Scout who boldly
told the world nine years ago that he had AIDS was honored Thursday
at his emotionally draining funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's overwhelming grief at the loss of my only son, my
youngest child,'' his father, Hank, said, his voice breaking as he
spoke. ''It is, I think, impossible to imagine this grief. It's the
most difficult thing I've ever done, and much more difficult than
the most difficult thing I ever imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yet at the same time, there's a sense of overwhelming love and
support,'' he said. ''Our friends, our community, the world --
everyone has been so good to us. Henry was dealt a very difficult
hand. I think he played it as best he could.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicols, 26, died Monday from injuries he suffered in a car
accident two weeks ago. He had contracted the dreaded HIV virus
that causes AIDS during a 1984 blood transfusion to treat his
hemophilia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The loss is especially new, so fresh, so recent that it's
overwhelming,'' his sister, Jennifer, said in her eulogy. ''He
touched so many lives, gave so much hope and understanding. Today
we're able to see the dividends. It's tragic that his life was cut
so short, but while he was with us he was like Peter Pan. He was
magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicols began to deliver that magic at age 17, turning heads with
his announcement March 8, 1991 that he had full-blown AIDS. It was
a time when relatively few people knew much about the virus, and
fewer still knew anyone infected with it.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you can say he made anything safe, he made it safe for
people to have AIDS,'' said Bill Cramer, a local scoutmaster. ''He
took it in his teeth and he ran with it at a time when people were
running for cover.''
</P>
<P>
   And he never stopped, traveling the world to promote AIDS
awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of doctors thought it was pretty grim,'' his other
sister, Diana, said. ''They thought he would just get AIDS and die.
He used to joke that he had the life expectancy of a hamster.''
</P>
<P>
   The funeral mass, which was tinged with a sense of wonderment,
was attended by scores of boy scouts, family and friends -- more
than 300 people in all. They packed every corner of the small red
brick church where Henry was baptized to celebrate his memorable
life.
</P>
<P>
   ''Henry Nicols accomplished, in a few years, work that is
exceptional, helping to change attitudes and turn fear, ignorance
and prejudice into understanding and compassion for people
afflicted with AIDS,'' Friar John Roos said. ''Henry has climbed
many mountains, and he's overcome mountains of adversity and
misfortune, very high mountains that would really have brought
discomfort to most of us. That merits from all of us deep
admiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicols, who was an avid mountaineer, dedicated his Eagle Scout
community service project to educating people about HIV and AIDS,
always rejecting the label of ''innocent victim.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Henry was the brother I never had,'' 18-year-old boy scout
Michael Henrici said, tears welling in his eyes. ''He's not gone as
long as we remember everything he taught us.''
</P>
<P>
   And although Henry was hospitalized repeatedly, he never lost
hope and never stopped planning for the future. He even had it
figured out that he would be old enough to run for president in
2008 and told a group of seventh-graders during an AIDS lecture
that he planned on it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Henry never planned to die,'' Hank Nicols said. ''Even though
he had a terminal illness that could be devastating, he lived life.
Every single day was very important to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, at a brief graveside ceremony, Nicols was laid to
rest on a hillside overlooking Otsego Lake. As a bugler played
taps, Henrici folded the American flag that had been draped over
the oaken coffin and handed it to Henry's parents.
</P>
<P>
   A lone bagpiper off in the distance then began to play the hymn
''Amazing Grace'' as a dozen of Henry's mountain-climbing buddies
slowly lowered his casket into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   That brought more tears.
</P>
<P>
   ''I''m glad that we had those 11 days to reflect,'' Hank Nicols
said of his son's final days in the hospital. ''The last day, which
was the most difficult, we were all with him. We could pet him and
touch him and tell him that we loved him. We were with him when he
died, and there was a great deal of comfort in that.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we did not bury my son today. We buried his body and he's
dead. But I think the good that he's done and the good that he's
continuing to do is what's important.''

<HEADLINE> Conditions Sought in Time-AOL Deal  </HEADLINE>
By LOUINN LOTA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. is asking federal
regulators to require America Online and Time Warner to agree to
provide other Internet service providers access to their high-speed
cable lines as a condition of approval of their merger.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's request was part of a filing on the proposed merger
Thursday with the Federal Communications Commission Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Disney is not opposing the proposed merger. We do think the
Federal Communications Commission should impose meaningful and
enforceable conditions ... and rather than vague promises of open
access, we think that spelling out what is acceptable and
unacceptable is vital in this proposed merger so that consumers
know what they're getting,'' said Disney spokesman John Dreyer.
</P>
<P>
   He said the open access question was specifically aimed at
keeping high-speed broadband lines, which are able to distribute
Internet video, sound and data simultaneously, open to competing
content providers.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators have refused to broach the issue of mandatory
sharing of cable companies' high-speed lines.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, companies that want access to cable companies'
high-speed lines must negotiate agreements with them. The cable
industry favors continuation of this voluntary approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''This really is about what happens when there is broadband
distribution of content, full broadband that is interactive. What
if there's only one cable provider where you live? With broadband,
there won't be full competition,'' Dreyer said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's cable systems include WB Network, Warner Bros.
Studios, cable networks and print media holdings. AOL is the
nation's largest Internet Service Provider.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, AOL said the companies have made clear that
their ''commitment to open access and content diversity couldn't be
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies ''are also committed to offering consumers a broad
choice of the best content available regardless of who produces it,
and to distributing our own content as widely as possible on as
many platforms as possible regardless of affiliation,'' the
statement said.

Annan Hints at More S. Leone Troops
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Embattled U.N. forces in Sierra Leone might need
reinforcements and an expanded mandate to combat rebel attacks and salvage the
country's battered peace process, Secretary-General Kofi Annan suggested
Thursday. Speaking at a late-night emergency meeting of the Security Council,
Annan welcomed the deployment of about 800 British troops as well as offers by
West African countries to contribute extra forces -- including a possible
rapid-reaction force that could take on a combat role in enforcing the country's
peace accord.

GOP Warned on China Trade Bill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The administration's point man on China bluntly warned
Republicans on Thursday that they will have to accept a human rights monitoring
panel to win passage of landmark trade legislation. Commerce Secretary William
Daley said he believed that chances for congressional approval of permanent
normal trade relations with China were ''slim to none'' without legislation to
create a congressional-executive commission to monitor China's human rights
performance. Meanwhile, President Clinton warned members of his own party that
Democrats would be hurt if their opposition killed the legislation.

Fire Sweeps Through Los Alamos, N.M.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Driven by swirling wind of up 55 mph, fire rolled
from block to block in abandoned Los Alamos Thursday, burning scores of homes
down to their foundations in the town where the atomic bomb was built.
Firefighters rushed to save houses as orange flames and billowing smoke rose
over the town. Whole neighborhoods were reduced to ruins, with everything from
trailers to mansions going up in smoke in a blaze that had been set by the
government to clear away brush in the wilderness but raged out of control over
the weekend.

GOP Weighs Primary Schedule Changes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Republicans who believe their states were practically
shut out of the presidential nominating process are backing a proposal to let
smaller states vote first in early March, with clusters of larger states voting
later through June. But representatives of some of those big states, including
California, Florida, Illinois and Texas, opposed the plan, debated Thursday by
the Republican National Committee's rules panel. A vote was expected Friday,
when the RNC's state chairmen's meeting reconvenes.

Bush Pulls Even With Gore Among Women
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George Bush has pulled even with Al Gore in women's
support, helping the Republican edge ahead in a broader survey of likely
presidential voters. Americans say they also feel Bush is more charismatic, has
a better sense of humor and is more inspiring. On the other hand, people in the
new polling said they find Gore, the Democratic vice president, more attractive
and more caring about people. Campaign polls out Thursday suggested that Bush,
the Texas governor, has largely recovered from his slump in the polls in March
and has made gains among several key voter groups.

Denver Newspapers Joining Forces

   DENVER (AP) -- Denver's two newspapers announced plans Thursday to form a
joint operating company, acknowledging their bitter yet colorful competition
eventually would have forced one of them out of business. Under the proposal,
The Denver Post and the Denver Rocky Mountain News would maintain separate news
operations but would equally share business functions, including advertising and
circulation sales, production and newspaper distribution.

Source: Knight May Be Asked To Quit
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Bob Knight's coaching career at Indiana is in
jeopardy with trustees considering asking him to resign, a high-ranking school
official told The Associated Press. The official, speaking on condition of
anonymity after talking to several university trustees, said the decision could
be ''tantamount to dismissal.'' University trustees will meet Sunday, apparently
to decide whether to expand an investigation into Knight, who has been accused
of physical and verbal abuse during his 29 years as Indiana's basketball coach.
The probe is expected to be completed by mid-June.

<HEADLINE> Fire Tests Los Alamos Residents  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE ARRILLAGA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- A black kettle resting on a fireplace
was all that remained of one home. Down the road, a basketball hoop
stood intact in a driveway, its net still hanging but singed. The
house it once flanked lay behind it in a smoldering mess.
</P>
<P>
   With daybreak Thursday came the harsh realization: A chunk of
Los Alamos was gone, gobbled up by a wind-whipped forest fire that
damaged up to 400 homes and the spirit of this town built around a
storied nuclear weapons facility.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've lost quite a bit,'' said Brian Deschamp, manager at the
Best Western Hilltop House hotel, the only business open in this
city of 11,000 people. ''I don't even want to go out there.''
</P>
<P>
   As residents were kept from their homes for a second day, 1,000
firefighters continued battling blazes that scorched 20,000 acres
of land and threatened to consume still more houses and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   From any vantage point in town, plumes of white smoke could be
seen billowing across an otherwise blue sky, as the horizon took on
a tangerine tint. At one point flames flickered a few hundred yards
from the police department, although downtown remained mostly
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different story all along the city's perimeter, where
scars from the blaze were visible from the scorched grasses of Los
Alamos nuclear laboratory to the charred homes on the city's west
and north sides.
</P>
<P>
   On Ridgeway Street on the western edge of town, home after home
was burned to the ground on a mesa overlooking Los Alamos Canyon.
The canyon's towering ponderosa pines, once viewed from the back
porches of homes valued at more than a quarter-million dollars, can
now be seen through scorched shells.
</P>
<P>
   At 4222 Ridgeway, a lone firefighter stood alongside what had
been a garage, dousing the collapsed structure to prevent any
remaining hot spots from igniting the house next door, which stood
unscathed. A few doors down, firefighters fought back flames at two
more homes that initially had been considered out of danger.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last night, these two houses were saved,'' said Don Shainin, a
battalion commander with the Albuquerque Fire Department. ''You can
see what they look like now.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood, one of the oldest in town, is part of Los
Alamos Police Sgt. John Chicoine's neighborhood watch route. It's
home to a melting pot of families, retirees and lab workers.
Chicoine knows one retired police dispatcher who lives in the area,
but his home was spared -- for now.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fire just comes out of that canyon and grabs a house,
while another might not be touched,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the south side of town, at the laboratory complex, fire swept
across 1,000 acres of land -- blowing by concrete bunkers that store
explosives and coming within 300 yards of a plutonium storage
facility. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, in town Thursday to
view the damage, reassured both the public and the lab's 7,000
employees that the facility was safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will recover,'' he said. ''This has been a tragedy for this
community, but this community helped us win the Cold War, and we're
going to stand very much behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos, a canyon-studded city 70 miles north of Albuquerque,
arose from the top-secret Manhattan Project that built the world's
first atomic bomb during World War II. After several years of
functioning as a sort of federal government reservation, residents
petitioned the U.S. and New Mexico governments for county status. A
measure creating Los Alamos was signed into law in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Deschamp, a resident here for 20 years, described the community
as ''tight. It's like a little Mayberry.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as the town doesn't burn, we'll be fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others were less sure about the road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our task right now is to try to get everybody back in the
town, and get about the business of trying to rebuild our lives,''
said Benny Roybal, a Los Alamos police officer for 10 years. ''It's
going to be a long time before that happens.''

<HEADLINE> Izzo Pondering Hawks Offer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Tom Izzo, who guided Michigan State to the NCAA
championship, has talked with the Atlanta Hawks about their
coaching job and reportedly is considering an offer to replace
Lenny Wilkens.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Thursday that the
Hawks offered Izzo a five-year contract worth more than $15 million
and expect his decision by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State spokesman John Lewandowski said Izzo received
permission from school president Peter McPherson to talk with the
Hawks, who have been searching for a coach since Wilkens resigned
under pressure April 24.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shouldn't come as a great surprise to anyone because of
the great success we've had the last three years,'' Lewandowski
said. ''We understand that goes with the territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Izzo was on a Caribbean cruise this week with his family. He is
scheduled to return to East Lansing, Mich., Sunday, according to
Lewandowski.
</P>
<P>
   But in its Friday editions, the Journal-Constitution said Izzo
canceled his family's Disney cruise and spent Thursday with Hawks
president Stan Kasten and general manager Pete Babcock.
</P>
<P>
   It was unlikely that Izzo would make a decision on the Hawks
offer until after returning to East Lansing on Friday, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Free Press reported Friday that Izzo met with the
Hawks on the way to Florida for the vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens, the winningest coach in NBA history, resigned after
seven seasons with the Hawks. The team missed the playoffs for the
first time in eight years and struggled to its worst record (28-54)
since moving to Atlanta in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo has a 120-48 record in five seasons as coach, including
three straight Big Ten titles and consecutive appearances in the
Final Four. Izzo, who was making about $850,000 a year, recently
agreed to a new five-year, roll-over contract that would be worth
$1.1 million annually, plus bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Hawks general manager Pete Babcock said the team would not
comment on its coaching search. In the past, he has described his
ideal candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking for energy,'' Babcock said. ''We're looking for
someone who can provide specific direction. We're looking for
someone who is committed to player development. We're looking for
someone who can relate to the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Izzo, who grew up watching men carry lunch buckets on their way
to work in the ore mines of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, had a
special relationship with his players because of the ability to
mesh his blue-collar background with a fine-tuned sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ''My players have a partnership in this team,'' he said during
the Final Four. ''It's not a dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   With a team that started three seniors and two juniors, Izzo was
willing to let his players suggest plays at crucial times.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks have six players who are 25 and younger and will get
at least a top-eight draft pick this year. In addition, the team is
likely to have more than $10 million in salary cap room to pursue a
prominent free agent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Only one college coach has won an NCAA title and left the next
season for the NBA. Larry Brown moved to San Antonio in 1988 after
leading Kansas to a national championship.

<HEADLINE> Brand, Francis Share Rookie Award  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Elton Brand and Steve Francis discovered they had
a lot in common when they got to know each other last summer.
</P>
<P>
   They both loved basketball, obviously. They had both played at
Atlantic Coast Conference schools, Brand at Duke and Francis at
Maryland. And they had gone 1-2 in the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Now the two have something else to share. On Thursday, Brand and
Francis were selected co-winners of the NBA's Rookie of the Year
Award.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our relationship is basketball,'' Brand said. ''We like to
play basketball, we like to have a lot of fun. I think that's why
we hit if off so well and became friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may always be connected, especially because of the tough
rookie of the year race.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand, the forward from the Chicago Bulls, and Francis, the
guard for the Houston Rockets, each received 58 of a possible 121
votes from a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters. Lamar Odom of
the Los Angeles Clippers received three votes, and Andre Miller of
the Cleveland Cavaliers got two.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the third time two rookies have shared the honor.
Jason Kidd and Grant Hill were co-winners in 1994-95, and Dave
Cowens and Geoff Petrie shared it in 1970-71.
</P>
<P>
   Brand said he was also sharing the award with his mother, Daisy,
who moved to Chicago with him and attended all but one of his games
this season. He surprised his mother with flowers and gave her a
kiss after accepting the award.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without my mom, it would have been a lot tougher,'' said
Brand, who would be finishing his junior year at Duke if he had
stayed in college. ''At 21 years old, it helps having your mom in
the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Brand was the No. 1 pick in the draft -- the first-ever
No. 1 for the Bulls -- Francis was the early favorite for the rookie
award. There were those who thought Brand was too small to bang
with the NBA's big boys. Others said he lacked Francis' flash and
flair.
</P>
<P>
   But Brand was consistently solid all season. He led all rookies
in scoring (20.1 points), rebounding (10.0), blocked shots (1.63)
and minutes (37) per game. He also was tops in double-doubles (42)
and led the NBA with 4.3 offensive rebounds per game.
</P>
<P>
   He joined David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Alonzo Mourning and
Tim Duncan as rookies in the past decade who averaged 20 points and
10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   His high of 44 points against the Washington Wizards on April 13
was the highest output by a rookie since Philadelphia's Allen
Iverson ended his streak of five 40-point-plus games with 50 on
April 12, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''He absolutely lived up to our expectations,'' Bulls coach Tim
Floyd said of Brand. ''He deserves the credit for that because he
had a lot of pressure on him as the No. 1 pick, particularly in
this organization because of what preceded him.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand won the monthly rookie honors in January, February and
April. He shared the April award with Francis, who made a strong
push at the end of the season. Francis scored 30 or more points
four times in the final month.
</P>
<P>
   Francis also won the monthly award in December and March.
</P>
<P>
   He finished the season as the rookie leader in assists (6.6 per
game) and finished second to Brand with 18 points per game. He was
fifth in scoring among all point guards in the NBA and was the
seventh rookie to average at least 15 points, five assists and five
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, Oscar Robertson, Alvan Adams, Magic Johnson, Michael
Jordan and Penny Hardaway were the others.
</P>
<P>
   ''He came into a changing environment where we had more than 20
starting lineups, and through it all he grew by leaps and bounds,''
Houston coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Steve Francis is a very good NBA player and he has a chance to
be one of the best ever at his position. He will get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand is the second Bulls player to win the rookie award. Jordan
won in 1984-85.
</P>
<P>
   Francis, traded to Houston after initially being selected second
overall by the Vancouver Grizzlies, is the second Rockets player to
win the award. Ralph Sampson won it in 1983-84.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any rookie will tell you they want to be the sole winner, but
I was going up against the No. 1 pick and it's tough to beat him
out,'' Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Brand, ''I have a part of it, a part of history. You can't
be disappointed about winning rookie of the year. Even if it's
co-winners.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defeated But Not Down  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA BULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) -- Following a 4-1 quarterfinal
elimination at the hands of Slovakia, the United States came off
the ice defeated but not down.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that was on the brink of relegation into the world
hockey 'B' pool only two years ago, the United States' undefeated
march to the World Hockey Championships quarterfinals was in itself
a significant exploit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course it's disappointing when you play the whole
tournament without losing one game, then bam! you're out,'' said
Calgary Flames defenseman Phil Housley, the NHL's career American
scoring leader. ''But that was the only negative thing of the whole
tournament. We were strong, we played great and we're still proud.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
</P>
<P>
   ''We turned some heads here and it's definitely one of the best
showings the USA has ever had here,'' Housley said. ''I told the
guys for us to hold our heads high. We went almost undefeated. We
beat the Russians and the Swedes at the 2000 world championships.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the team finished fifth, one spot up from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Having beaten both the star-studded, though ill-fated, Russian
team 3-0 as well as 1998 world champion Sweden 5-3, and holding a
4-0-2 record, the U.S. team thought a medal of some color was
awaiting. And the Americans appeared to be on the road to success
when they scored the opening goal in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   But their hopes were snuffed when the tough Slovaks gained an
important, decisive psychological edge, scoring three times in less
than four minutes to take a 3-1 lead in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Disheartened and incapable of answering, the United States saw
all its hard work and success suddenly go for naught.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tough loss, the Americans left the newly built Ice
Palace with optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Only two years ago, the United States made headlines after
leaving the worlds beaten, bruised and on the brink of relegation
to the international 'B' pool.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the team grabbed attention for a different reason.
</P>
<P>
   Playing disciplined, organized hockey, coach Lou Vairo's squad
displayed the cohesion and team spirit that helped make up for the
lack of stars.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a good group of players where no one stood out,'' said
Housley. ''There were no Dennis the Menaces, no stars. We came
together as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone was skilled and everyone could skate and handle the
puck, which is important in a tournament like this. And there were
a lot of scouts and GMs watching and it should help all their
careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Americans, finished sixth after the NHL's top
stars turned down an invitation to play.
</P>
<P>
   Again this year, with few exceptions, the United States' best
players skipped the annual championship in Europe or couldn't make
it because their teams were still locked into the Stanley Cup
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   So the Americans ended up with 13 NHL grinders, and filled out
the lineup with minor, college and European league players.
</P>
<P>
   But unconcerned by the lack of big names on the team, Vairo
refused to consider trading in those players who led the United
States to the quarterfinals with NHL players newly eliminated from
the Stanley Cup playoffs, as the tournament's rules allow.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a big factor in our good performance,'' Hendrickson
said. ''He wasn't going to trade us in. We had the feeling this was
our tournament, our chance to make it big, our chance at the title.
</P>
<P>
   ''And it made us stronger and tighter as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of solidarity that was sadly lacking in the
Russian team.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had what the Russians didn't have and that was cohesion,''
said Vancouver Canuck Darby Hendrickon. ''We played as a team. We
played with heart.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the best and I won't be leaving here with bitterness or
regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a performance U.S. hockey badly needed.
</P>
<P>
   Following their stunning victory over Canada in the final of the
inaugural World Cup of Hockey in Montreal in September 1996,
Americans in international hockey had been caught in a slow,
downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   With virtually an identical team from the World Cup playing at
the Nagano Games, the United States failed to medal, and sullied
its image by trashing rooms in the Olympic Village following its
quarterfinal elimination by the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, no Olympians went to Switzerland for the
world championships and the players who did go sustained a string
of embarrassments, including a humiliating 4-0 loss to Italy, a
team with no NHL players, and an unprecedented 3-1 round-robin
defeat by France.
</P>
<P>
   Losing in the relegation round, the United States was forced to
compete in a last-chance tournament the following autumn in order
to claw its way back into the 'A' pool.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has won the championships twice since they
began in 1920. They last medaled in Vienna in 1996, when they took
the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a disappointing outcome, because I think we deserved a
medal,'' Housley said. ''But we talked in the locker room and we
feel good.''

<HEADLINE> Hurst Takes Two-Stroke LPGA Lead  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) -- Kristal Parker can only hope she can
ignore the pain in her neck for three more days.
</P>
<P>
   Parker woke up Wednesday morning with a recurrence of the
sciatica that first developed in 1998 during a pregnancy. She
headed to the LPGA Tour's health center for treatment, then waited
until 40 minutes before her tee time in the final group of
Thursday's opening round before deciding to play.
</P>
<P>
   She played through pain that came every time a club struck the
ground and shot a 5-under 67 in the new Electrolux USA
Championship, tied with Cindy Figg-Currier two strokes behind
leader Pat Hurst (65).
</P>
<P>
   ''For the most part, I was just trying to keep it positive; mind
over matter kind of mentality out there,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Meg Mallon, who won the final Sara Lee Classic in Nashville last
year, was among six players at 69. Karrie Webb was eight strokes
back with a 73 in her attempt to win her fifth LPGA tournament and
seventh title this year after winning in Japan last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The pain hit Parker last week, forcing her to withdraw from the
Phillips Invitational. Parker, whose best tour finish was second in
1996, played a practice round at The Legends Club's Ironhorse
Course on Tuesday only to have trouble swinging during practice on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After deciding to play, she didn't waste any time and birdied
five of the first nine holes. She had her chances to catch Hurst,
but bogeyed the par-4 sixth when her second shot went right and she
couldn't get up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Parker got the stroke back on the next hole when her chip hit
the pin, leaving her a tap-in birdie. She missed a chance to pull
within a stroke when she left a 15-foot putt short.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the pain, Parker happily took her 67, which matched
her best score this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I probably had about six or seven swings out there in a lot of
pain,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She headed straight to the health center for more treatment and
Advil. Whether she can avoid her third cut of the year or survive
until Sunday is in God's hands, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Usually, the only way I get rid of it is rest it, and that's
obviously not going to come right now,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst showed she has nearly recovered her stroke following the
birth of her first child last June. On a day where gusting winds
slowed play and forced golfers to move up at least a club or two,
Hurst had what she called nearly a perfect day with six birdies, an
eagle and a bogey for her lowest round this year.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Seeks 1st Playoff Road Win  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- The last time the Los Angeles Lakers went on the
road in the playoffs, it was a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   They will try to erase the memory of that ugly trip to
Sacramento tonight when they play the Phoenix Suns in Game 3 of the
Western Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have a great team and two great, great players,'' Suns
coach Scott Skiles said. ''I feel they would like to get this thing
over with. They had the experience in Sacramento where they went
there and Sac put two on them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like they're going to come here and want to get this
one and get a big leg up, and then maybe get some rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers lost those two in Sacramento to force a deciding Game
5 of their first-round series, a game Los Angeles won handily.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns already have put a scare into the Lakers, losing 97-96
in Game 2 Wednesday night on Kobe Bryant's 15-footer with 2.6
seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   That put Los Angeles up 2-0 in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, who has averaged 37.5 points and 17 rebounds
in the two victories, said a split of the two games in Phoenix
would be good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as we can get one of these games, we'll be happy,''
O'Neal said. ''If we can get two of the games, it will be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix rallied in the fourth quarter to nearly beat the Lakers
with tight full-court defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't have a lot of ball-handlers,'' the Suns' Penny
Hardaway said. ''Even Kobe isn't a terrific ball-handler. We just
have to put the pressure on them and take them out of their rhythm,
not let them just come down and pass and cut. Then it becomes a
different ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Phil Jackson said many of his team's fourth-quarter
miscues in Game 2 were self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Three of the turnovers we had were completely unforced,''
Jackson said. ''Yes, their pressure defense activated them, got
them motivated. Can they do it for 48 minutes?''
</P>
<P>
   Skiles said no, ''we have to pick our spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway was still shaking his head that no foul was called
against O'Neal on the Suns' next-to-last possession in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've gone over in my mind a million times what would have
happened if they'd call that foul or if I'd taken the baseline when
I had it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns were leading 96-95 when Hardaway drove to the basket
and O'Neal, his old teammate in Orlando, stood in the way. Hardaway
said O'Neal hit him in the shoulder, causing him to lose control of
the ball as he shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the MVP. He just had received the trophy before the
game,'' Hardaway said. ''There was a lot of pressure on the refs
not to make that call even though it was a foul. Hopefully we'll
get that call when we're here at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The foul wasn't flagrant enough for the officials to make it in
front of the pro-Lakers crowd at that point in the game, Hardaway
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the first quarter, that call would be made, easy,''
Hardaway said. But late in the game, ''you'd have to get your head
taken off or knocked to the floor or something so the fans won't
react to it if they call it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles said videotape showed it was obviously a foul.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's frustrating, but all year long we've had a hard time
getting to the foul line for whatever reason,'' Skiles said.
''Maybe that reputation is hurting us or something. That's clearly
a foul, but it's just one of those things.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Lakers can point to plays that clearly are fouls on us.
It's not like there's a conspiracy or anything. It was just, in my
opinion, a call that should have been called and was missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix guard Jason Kidd, who played 43 minutes with no ill
effects on his surgically repaired left ankle, said he felt fine,
but a little tired, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles said the strong fourth quarter should provide some
momentum for his team.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly we were right there, and if a phenomenal player
wouldn't have made a great play, we would have won the game,''
Skiles said. ''Kobe made a great, great shot. Hopefully our guys
take something out of that.
</P>
<P>
   ''NBA basketball is not a place where you take away moral
victories. You win or you lose. It's as simple as that. We lost and
yet the guys have a real positive feeling this morning. I think the
guys in that locker room believe and feel that they're going to win
the series.''

<HEADLINE> With a smile and a serious side, Egan takes Manhattan  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Newly-designated Archbishop Edward Egan recalled
his first encounter with Cardinal John O'Connor inside St.
Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor joked that he was unimpressed by Egan's fluency in
several languages.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cardinal said, 'He speaks Italian, French and all of
this,''' Egan recounted Thursday. ''Then he said, 'I'm going to
give him six months to learn our language.'''
</P>
<P>
   Egan, speaking hours after Pope John Paul II named him as head
of the New York Archdiocese, demonstrated his conversance in New
York-ese during his first meeting with the local media.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing a dry Irish wit with conservative church doctrine, Egan
arrived Thursday to assume the mantle of the late cardinal and the
spiritual leadership of 2.4 million followers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody told me there would be a few microphones here,'' Egan
deadpanned as he stood before a bank of cameras at his first news
conference. ''I love New York understatement.''
</P>
<P>
   The gray-haired, balding Egan, dressed in black with a simple
white cleric's collar, joked with reporters in the Cathedral High
School gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   But he turned serious when asked about the issues confronting
him as occupant of the Catholic Church's highest-profile U.S.
pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   On abortion and birth control, the 68-year-old Egan predictably
backed Pope John Paul II's opposition to both. Asked by a Vatican
radio reporter if he would be pro-life, Egan said emphatically,
''Without any question, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal also expressed optimism that he would not close any
of the archdiocese's schools, a question raised because he had
reorganized the Catholic schools during his 12 years in Bridgeport,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, who is to be installed June 19, becomes the 12th man to
lead New York's Catholics. He received generally positive reviews
from those who know him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's an imposing figure and a great preacher,'' said Monsignor
Timothy Dolan, an American who heads the North American Pontifical
College in Rome. Noting the similarity to O'Connor, Dolan added,
''When Ed Egan walks into a room, he doesn't go unnoticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Pieczynski, spokeswoman for the Chicago-based church
reform group Call to Action, described Egan as ''very
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My understanding is that he is very personable, but also very
rigid in his approach to issues,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, who spent 12 years leading 367,000 people in the diocese
of Bridgeport, stopped by St. Patrick's Cathedral on Thursday
afternoon and led a small group of visitors in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of about 40 people applauded the newly-named
archbishop, who offered his thanks in English and Spanish.
''Thanks,'' he said. ''Thanks a million.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan, praising his predecessor, said he hoped to gain the same
New York acceptance that the Philadelphia-born O'Connor had
achieved during his 16 years. O'Connor, 80, died last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can tell you there is no place in the world that is quicker
to accept someone who wants to be a New Yorker,'' said Egan, who
worked in the New York Archdiocese earlier in his career. ''I want
to be a New Yorker, and I guess I am officially one.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan, born in Oak Park, Ill., studied theology at Rome's
prestigious Gregorian Pontifical University. He served from 1971 to
1985 on the Vatican tribunal that decides important juridical
matters, including whether to grant annulments.
</P>
<P>
   He took over the Bridgeport diocese in 1988, winning acclaim for
reorganizing diocesan schools and recruiting local men into the
priesthood. He was able to raise millions of dollars in his annual
bishop's appeal in the diocese, which embraces Fairfield County,
one of the richest in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Egan came under fire for defending the Bridgeport diocese
against more than two dozen lawsuits over alleged sexual
molestation by local priests. Although all but one of the cases
preceded Egan's arrival, they raised embarrassing questions over
whether abuse was covered up.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference Thursday, even when he stumbled slightly,
Egan remained at ease. Unsure of the etiquette during his question
and answer period, he paused briefly before cracking a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel like the boss,'' he said. ''But give me a little
time and I will.''

<HEADLINE> Knicks Take Homecourt Advantage  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- About to begin their sixth playoff game, the New
York Knicks feel they haven't been totally sharp yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had spurts, but we haven't been sharp for 48 minutes,''
Latrell Sprewell said as the Knicks prepared for Game 3 of their
best-of-seven series with Miami tied 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   New York swept the Toronto Raptors in the first round, but all
the games were decided in the final minute as the Knicks never put
together what they would consider their ''A'' game.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Heat, they have struggled in the fourth quarters of
both games -- failing to score a field goal in the final five
minutes of Game 1 and watching a double-digit lead dissolve toward
the end of Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had periods in both games where we've played well and
terrible. A lot of that is their defense and them knowing us, and
it's the same with us,'' Sprewell said. ''It's going to be that way
in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams' familiarity with each other comes from spending four
straight seasons meeting in the playoffs. For the past three years,
Miami has come to New York in need of a road win and got one each
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat are 3-4 at Madison Square Garden in the playoffs since
1997, which hardly qualifies as statistical evidence of a
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're a good team,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said
Thursday, ''and good teams can win anywhere they play. That's
really what it says.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Heat faced elimination in Game 4 at the Garden,
but outscored the Knicks 29-10 in the fourth quarter to force a
deciding Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   The previous year, the series was tied 1-1 when Miami came to
New York and won Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1997, the Heat took Game 6 on New York's home court as
Patrick Ewing, Allan Houston and Charlie Ward sat out with
suspensions stemming from a fight in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being at home only does so much. It won't win the game for
you,'' Houston said. ''They know that, and they just have to put
themselves in position to win. We have to take advantage of it by
protecting it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks will again try to contain Alonzo Mourning by trying
to keep him from setting up deep in the low post. They did so in
Game 2 by hindering him as he ran upcourt, putting bodies in his
way to give Ewing a chance to sprint upcourt and get in between
Mourning and the basket.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks also expect to continue to see double-teams whenever
their two primary scorers, Houston and Sprewell, have the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Houston shot 3-for-14 and Sprewell was 2-for-13 in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have to pick up the scoring a little bit, but every time
they're touching the ball they're getting double-teamed,'' Knicks
forward Marcus Camby said. ''Usually when a guy is the first
option, he's not going to get the shot against Miami. They force
other players to make shots, and the rest of us have to knock down
shots for us to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat will look for better games out of their point guards,
the hobbled Tim Hardaway and rookie Anthony Carter. Miami also must
do better at the free-throw line after going 19-for-33 in Game 2,
including eight straight misses early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, free-throw accuracy is no barometer of success for
the Heat -- especially in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 3 of their first-round series against the Knicks in
1998, Miami led by four points with 1:23 left and proceeded to miss
seven of eight free throws the rest of the way. The Heat won
anyway.

<HEADLINE> 'Cats' Extended Until Sept. 10  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The longest-running show on Broadway will be
around a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cats'' originally was scheduled to end its record-breaking
engagement at the Winter Garden Theater on June 25. But it will now
close Sept. 10, the musical's spokesman, Bill Evans, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The final performance, No. 7,485, will be by invitation only.
</P>
<P>
   Since the original closing was announced in February, weekly
ticket sales for the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical have more than
doubled, with the show often playing to full houses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cats'' opened Oct. 7, 1982, and became Broadway's
longest-running show in June 1997, surpassing ''A Chorus Line,''
which ran for 6,137 performances, from 1975 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The show, based on T.S. Eliot's ''Old Possum's Book of Practical
Cats,'' is still playing in London, where it opened in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cats'' was the first of the big British musicals with lavish
settings and pop scores to invade Broadway in the 1980s. It earned
a fortune for Lloyd Webber and producer Cameron Mackintosh, who
went on to bring ''Les Miserables,'' ''The Phantom of the Opera''
and ''Miss Saigon'' to Broadway.

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes in Iowa Injure at Least 10  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNKERTON, Iowa (AP) -- A dozen tornadoes struck northeastern
Iowa late Thursday, injuring at least 10 people, damaging buildings
and forcing the evacuation of a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   The tornadoes cut a swath of damage about 1{ miles wide
beginning just north of the Waterloo airport, through Dunkerton and
into Buchanan County, said Black Hawk County sheriff's Deputy Tony
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fortunately, it did not go through any densely populated
areas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly woman was in critical condition after a tornado
struck her home in Cedar Falls.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 tenants of a nursing home near Dunkerton were
evacuated after its roof was heavily damaged. Up to seven suffered
minor injuries, said Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Police told the National Weather Service that a co-op elevator
was heavily damaged and a church roof was blown off in Dunkerton,
which is 120 miles northeast of Des Moines. A farmhouse was
destroyed as were seven outbuildings, and a storm spotter said two
houses were destroyed in town.
</P>
<P>
   The storms, which also produced hail and heavy rain, were moving
slowly to the east.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Disparities Persist in Health  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Though more women are seeking early prenatal
care, a new study shows that black and Hispanic women are less
likely to see a doctor in the early stages of pregnancy, leading to
more health problems for minority mothers and their infants.
</P>
<P>
   White women are twice as likely as blacks and Hispanics to see a
doctor in the first few months of pregnancy, according to a study
released Thursday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   A CDC review of 13 states showed that in 1997, the percentage of
babies born to mothers whose first medical exam was more than three
months into their pregnancy was 27.7 percent for black women, 26.3
for Hispanic women and 12.1 percent for white women.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, a CDC analysis of U.S. births showed the number of
women who delayed prenatal care or did not seek care declined from
25 percent in 1989 to 18 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Women who don't see a doctor until after the first three months
of pregnancy risk complications such as premature delivery and low
birth-weight babies, CDC epidemiologist Suzanne Zane said.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes, high blood pressure, infections, clotting and bleeding
need to be caught early to avoid health problems that can kill, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The improvement may be partly due to an expansion of Medicaid in
the mid-1980s that made it possible for more women to pay a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Of the women who did not see a doctor early on, the most
frequent explanation was that they did not know they were pregnant.
Inability to pay and lack of health insurance were also significant
factors.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Surgeon General David Satcher called for research
into why the gap persists. He pointed out that black women are
nearly four times as likely to die of pregnancy-related causes as
white women.
</P>
<P>
   ''Studies estimate that at least half of these deaths are
preventable based on current medical knowledge,'' Satcher said.

<HEADLINE> Stars Hope To Join Elite Group  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The Colorado Avalanche understand what the Dallas
Stars are trying to do. Four years ago, they were the defending
Stanley Cup champions hoping to join the elite group of repeat
winners.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Saturday, the Avalanche will be the next-to-last
obstacle in the Stars' quest for a second straight title when the
teams meet in the opener of the best-of-seven Western Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between a one-time champion and a multiple winner
is immense. Being on top of a sport for two years or more brands a
club as truly special and not just a group that got hot at the
right time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not many teams can say they won back-to-back Cups,'' said
center Joe Nieuwendyk, who won a Cup with Calgary in 1989 then
again with Dallas a decade later. ''That's the biggest challenge
for us. We've put together a good team and we'd like to ride this
as far as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock is using the phrase ''two-time
champion'' as a dangling carrot to motivate his team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure Colorado feels the same way, because when you win
once, you see the stuff that goes with the Edmontons and the
Detroits and the New York Islanders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you win a couple times, there's a certain status that
goes with that. I mean, they still call Detroit a championship
team, but they haven't been there for two years. So, that's what
we're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, though, has said his team is the underdog because
Colorado is playing so well. Avalanche coach Bob Hartley sees some
gamesmanship in that comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough to say you're playing the underdog when you're
playing the Stanley Cup champions,'' he said. ''This year, they had
another season over 100 points. I think he's just trying to play a
little mind game.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Dallas doesn't win it all, the Stars can't be written
off as a one-year wonder. This is their third straight year in the
conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   They beat the Avalanche last year in a thrilling seven-game
series, then beat Buffalo for the first title in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas and Colorado have advanced this far by going 6-0 at home
and splitting their road games. The Stars went through the bottom
two seeded teams (Edmonton and San Jose), while the Avalanche faced
tougher foes in Phoenix and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The series all get tougher as you go along in the playoffs, so
it's going to be that much tougher for us than it was against
Detroit,'' Colorado center Peter Forsberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive titles used to be the norm in the NHL. From 1974-88,
the Cup was shared by only four clubs and all but one of their
titles was followed by another.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia did it in '74-75, then Montreal and the New York
Islanders each won four straight. Wayne Gretzky led Edmonton to
four championships the next five years, with the Canadiens
interrupting the streak. Since then, Mario Lemieux's Pittsburgh
clubs won in '91-92 and Detroit did it in '97-98.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano was in his second season when the then-Minnesota
North Stars lost to the Penguins in the 1991 finals. It took nearly
nine seasons to get back to the finals, so he fully appreciates
what it would mean to be two-time champs.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'd like to ride the wave as long as possible because you
don't know when the tide is going to turn in your organization and
changes are going to be made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't know when you're going to have a group of guys like
we've had here the last three, four years. You don't know how long
that can last, so you have to make the most of it.''

<HEADLINE> Defense Leading Devils in Playoffs  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- If one thing is making the New Jersey
Devils laugh in the playoffs, it's all the whining about their
defense, that so-called neutral zone trap.
</P>
<P>
   To a man, the Devils insist they aren't playing the trap in
center ice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just think we are playing a system,'' forward Jay Pandolfo
said Thursday after the Devils held meetings at their South
Mountain training facility to prepare for the opening game of the
best-of-seven Eastern Conference final in Philadelphia on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if it's called a trap or what,'' Pandolfo added.
''I don't even think we are sitting back and waiting for teams to
come. We've been putting a lot of pressure on them in their zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Florida nor Toronto mounted much offense in the first
two rounds of the playoffs against New Jersey, but the Flyers will
present a different challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Philadelphia playing well, it also has the size and
strength to match up against the Devils, even with Eric Lindros and
Keith Primeau probably sidelined with concussions.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers also are playing a different style without Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people believe in opening it up, but that's not the way
this team plays now,'' defenseman Chris Therien said after practice
on Thursday. ''It's defense first. The Devils play the same way we
do. It's almost like a chess match. It's who wants to be the most
patient. Some goals are going to be scored by which team makes a
mistake. That's the way the playoffs are.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Devils have been a little better statistically
than the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey goaltender Martin Broduer has faced 221 shots in 10
playoff games, giving up 15 goals. Flyers rookie goalie Brian
Boucher has faced 299 shots in 11 games, surrendering 22 goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our styles are a lot alike now,'' said Flyers center Simon
Gagne, who will move to second-line in the expected absence of
Primeau for Game 1. ''The games will be tight, the shots might be
15-15. We have to dump the puck, pinch our defensemen and work
really hard against that team.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's defense has given the Flyers problems in recent
years. The Devils won the season series 4-1, and it is 11-2-2
against Philadelphia over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just think we are playing good positional hockey,'' Devils
center Bobby Holik said. ''I don't see the trap being created that
much. We play well in our end and we play well in their end. We're
responsible with the puck. People can watch it and name it whatever
they want, whether they like it or not. We like it, we're
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   In eliminating Toronto on Monday night, New Jersey allowed a
modern-day, NHL-record low six shots in a 3-0 win.
</P>
<P>
   After the series, the Maple Leafs complained the Devils' system
of clogging up center ice and making it difficult to generate
offense made for a boring game.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people use the word trap, I get a kick out of it because
I still haven't heard it from (coach) Larry (Robinson) once,''
defenseman Ken Daneyko said.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing that has changed since Robinson took over is the
Devils are doing the little things to help their defense. When the
puck is in their end, they get it out quickly. They don't allow
much traffic in front of Brodeur and they have been very good in
limiting odd-man rushes.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the time that leaves opponents in the neutral zone
trying to get into the Devils' end, which makes them feel like they
are playing a neutral zone trap.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the complaining, and hence the laughter.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Darin Erstad and Troy Glaus homered and
Garret Anderson drove in the go-ahead run with a single in the
eighth inning as the Anaheim Angels beat the Texas Rangers 3-2
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied 2-2, Adam Kennedy singled with one out in
the eighth off Kenny Rogers (3-4) and took third on Mo Vaughn's
double. Tim Salmon was intentionally walked before Anderson lined a
1-1 pitch to center, scoring Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Shigetoshi Hasegawa (1-0) earned the victory with three innings
of one-hit relief, and Troy Percival got three outs for his 10th
save.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was charged with three runs and 10 hits in 7 1-3 innings.
He gave up a pair of singles with less than two outs in each of the
first two innings and escaped both jams, but failed to hold a 2-0
lead, as Erstad homered in the fifth and Glaus led off the seventh
with his ninth homer.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez's solo homer opened the scoring for Texas in the
first, and Luis Alicea drove in the second in the fifth with his
third single.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad regained the AL batting lead from Texas' David Segui with
two hits. Erstad finished the game with a .388 average. The
switch-hitting Segui, whose 13-game hitting streak was snapped, was
0-for-3 and dropped to .378. Segui started the game with a
one-point edge over Erstad.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Mercker, making his second start of the season for the
Angels because of Jason Dickson's strained left hip flexor, lasted
only 30 pitches before leaving with a severe headache and
dizziness. He gave up two hits in 1 1-3 innings, including
Rodriguez's 12th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker felt some discomfort in the second inning after throwing
his 25th pitch. But he was allowed to continue and made five more
pitches before leaving with a 2-2 count on Royce Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker's problem came two nights after Ken Hill tore a muscle
in his right side with one out in the third inning of a 5-2 loss
against Oakland. Hill was put on the 15-day disabled list after
that game.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia, who also lost shortstop Gary
DiSarcina to the disabled list immediately following Monday night's
9-8 victory over Oakland, had to change pitchers again in the sixth
when rookie right-hander Eric Weaver injured himself warming up.
The extent of the injury was not announced by the club.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rogers, who became the first left-hander in AL history to
pitch a perfect game when he beat the Angels 4-0 on July 28, 1994,
is 11-7 lifetime against Anaheim with a 3.57 ERA. ... Texas lefty
Justin Thompson is scheduled to undergo season-ending arthroscopic
surgery on Friday in Fort Worth to repair a torn rotator cuff.
Thompson, who in 1997 struck out Ken Griffey Jr. the first six
times they faced each other, had surgery last August to repair a
torn labrum. ... Angels pitchers have given up an AL-leading 54
home runs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Jason Giambi, back in his hitting groove
since being reunited with his younger brother, homered and drove in
five runs in the Oakland Athletics' 7-6 victory over Seattle on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi hit a three-run homer, a sacrifice fly and an RBI single
and also tripled as the A's survived a three-run homer by Jay
Buhner and solo shots by Alex Rodriguez and David Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi, who leads the majors with 15 homers and 42 RBIs, is
hitting .357 (10-for-28) since his brother, Jeremy, was recalled
from the minors on May 5.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi had a sacrifice fly in the first and a triple in
the third on a ball that went over the wall, but was knocked down
by center fielder Mike Cameron. His RBI single came in the fourth,
and he homered in the sixth to give Oakland a 7-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jason was hitting .328 when Jeremy was sent to the minors on
April 24. While Jeremy was at Triple-A Sacramento, Jason hit just
.212. Since his brother's return, Jason has four homers and 12 RBIs
in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Hernandez added a two-run double for the A's, who won at
home for just the sixth time in 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner, who has hit 18 homers at the Oakland Coliseum, hit his
seventh of the season to give the Mariners a 5-4 lead in the sixth.
His homer followed an RBI single by Edgar Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner leads active players for most homers by a visitor in
Oakland and is tied with Carlton Fisk for the career lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez hit his 11th homer leading off the eighth, pulling the
Mariners to 7-6, but three Oakland relievers protected the lead.
Jason Isringhausen allowed a hit and a walk in the ninth, but held
on for his seventh save in 10 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hudson (4-2) allowed six runs on seven hits in seven
innings, striking out seven, for the win. The loser was Gil Meche
(0-4), who allowed six runs on eight hits in 5 2-3 innings and
wasted his first significant run support of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The six runs were the most Seattle has scored in a game pitched
by Meche this season. Before Thursday night, the Mariners had
scored just four runs in six games while Meche was in the game.
They scored five while Meche was pitching Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Oakland's Terrence Long, who was struck in the face by a
ball during warmups Wednesday, had oral surgery Thursday and had
his lip stitched. He did not play Thursday. ... The A's have won
three straight. ... The Mariners are 46-101 in Oakland, their worst
mark in any AL city. ... The A's moved above .500 for the first
time since the opening series of the season. ... Oakland opened its
longest homestand of the season, an 11-game run against Seattle,
Kansas City and Minnesota.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Tourist Killed in Guatemala  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   TODOS SANTOS, Guatemala (AP) -- Satan worshippers -- a cult from
abroad that planned to sacrifice children in the local soccer field
-- were coming. Almost everyone in this little mountain town was
sure of it.
</P>
<P>
   So when a sleek bus with tinted windows arrived filled with
Japanese tourists -- people with pale skin in dark clothing, their
faces covered to protect against the sun -- villagers thought their
nightmare had come true.
</P>
<P>
   One Japanese tourist and a bus driver died in the mayhem that
followed, victims of a hysteria fueled by rumors and fears of
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how the rumors started, but they grew rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Some said a satanic leader from Los Angeles was on his way to
this village of 2,200 people. It was said he had asked to use the
soccer stadium for an all-night session of human sacrifice -- adding
to long-standing rumors of international child-stealing rings.
</P>
<P>
   Unconfirmed reports that a girl was stolen in the Huehuetenango
market a year earlier also sparked suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Fears grew so great in late April that officials closed schools
for two days. Some churches held round-the-clock prayer sessions.
Local police assured citizens they had a plan for dealing with
''the dark forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officials used newspaper and radio announcements to implore
villagers to stay calm. They denied any satanic cults had asked to
use the soccer field. Religious leaders tried to calm their
agitated congregations.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the people in Todos Santos can't read newspapers,
and the denials themselves sparked suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on April 29, the visitors rolled into town.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were in the wrong place at the worst possible time,''
said Mayor Julian Mendoza. ''Their bus was larger than normal, and
it had tinted windows. The Japanese were pale-skinned, in clothing
our people didn't understand, with their faces covered from the hot
sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourist Tetsuo Yamahiro startled 22-year-old Catarina Pablo by
inching a bit too close to her 9-month-old daughter, and Pablo
screamed the words villagers were prepared to hear: ''They've come
to take our babies!''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people in the outdoor Saturday market began reaching
for stones.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes Yamahiro lay dead, stoned across the street from
the shabby green-and-white marquee of Hotel La Paz.
</P>
<P>
   Down a graveled slope, Guatemalan bus driver Edgar Castellanos
had been hacked to death with a machete. His body was doused with
gasoline and ignited.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, investigators and journalists arrived to find
nothing more than a tranquil Indian village where every man except
the Coca-Cola truck driver wears hand-stitched red-and-white
striped pants and women wear colorful Mayan dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Todos Santos was absolutely the last place on earth we
expected something like this to happen,'' said Guido Galli, head of
the U.N. office in Huehuetenango, the largest nearby town, a
four-hour drive from Todos Santos.
</P>
<P>
   International tourists have been coming to Todos Santos since
the late 1980s, and its economy has come to depend on the visitors.
There are three Spanish-language schools for foreigners who spend
weeks, months and even years studying.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the electricity, running water and telephone service
tourism helped usher in, the hamlet remains so isolated that rumors
about outsiders run rampant and visitors are still considered
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fear stems from Guatemala's 1960-96 civil war, when
government forces saw Todos Santos and the surrounding areas as a
haven for leftist guerrillas and obliterated scores of villages in
military raids.
</P>
<P>
   The Mam-speaking people already had reason to distrust outsiders
who over centuries had treated them as second-class citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the people here are now very friendly with tourists,
but unlearning a fear of invaders from the outside is very
difficult,'' said Margarito Calmo, a 59-year-old teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Such rumors are so strong in the region that the U.S. Embassy in
neighboring Honduras warned this week they could lead to other
attacks similar to the one in Todos Santos.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have arrested 19 people in the attack on the
Japanese tourists, but Mendoza says he also feels a sense of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like the municipality and the religious leaders really
failed our people,'' he said. ''We were all trying to calm things
down, but instead we helped cause the tragedy.''

<HEADLINE> NM Fire Blame Official Put on Leave  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY MASSEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- The National Park Service superintendent
who ordered the brush-clearing fire that has raged out of control
in Los Alamos was placed on leave Thursday while officials
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Weaver, head of Bandelier National Monument for the past 10
years, has taken responsibility for ordering the ''controlled''
burn, saying he thought conditions had been just right for the
park's regular practice of clearing brush.
</P>
<P>
   However, a weather forecast warned of maximum potential for fire
growth in the area. Weaver has not said publicly whether he saw
that forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ''This action is administrative in nature and in no way reflects
on Superintendent Roy Weaver's decisions regarding the fire,'' said
Karen Wade, director of the intermountain regional office of the
Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, a 33-year employee of the Park Service whose annual
salary is $79,849, was put on leave with pay. Park Service
spokesman Rick Frost said it's not unusual to place an employee on
leave while the agency investigates an administrative decision. He
said it was unclear how long the investigation would take.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press has been unable to reach Weaver for
comment. His office phone was out of service because of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The New York Times before he was put on
leave, Weaver said: ''The data and the spot weather forecasts met
the fire prescription. It's not like someone was just picking
things out of the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said the fire team had requested and received weather
updates throughout the day, as late as two hours before the flames
were ignited at 7:20 p.m. on May 4, the Times reported on its Web
site. Seeing no reason to call off the plan, the crew set the fire.
Then, he said, the winds whipped up unexpectedly, and the flames
began spreading toward Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   While flames from the 20,000-acre blaze charred homes and forest
Thursday, members of Congress demanded a federal investigation and
suggested the government consider compensating families who lost
their homes and belongings.
</P>
<P>
   ''They obviously made the wrong decision based on the weather,''
said Rep. Tom Udall, whose district includes Los Alamos. ''This
just isn't the time to have any fire burning when you have such
extreme winds and no humidity.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if political pressure fails to deliver money to some of the
20,000 people forced to evacuate because of the fire, the federal
courts could.
</P>
<P>
   Under the federal Tort Claims Act, the government is generally
liable for negligent acts by its agencies and employees, said
Turner Branch, an Albuquerque lawyer who met Thursday with
potential clients from Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't keep a tiger in your back yard and not be
responsible if it gets out,'' Branch said. ''In this instance, the
tiger is a fire and they were not ready.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a lawsuit also might focus on whether the Forest Service
responded quickly enough to fight the fire once it raced out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service has said it faxed a special
forecast to Bandelier shortly before the fire was started. The
forecast, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press,
told park officials there was maximum potential for fire growth:
winds and temperatures were about to increase and there was a
diminishing chance for the usual rise in nighttime humidity.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast was headlined: ''6 HAINES INDEX THROUGH FRIDAY WITH
POOR NIGHTTIME RH RECOVERY ...'' RH stands for relative humidity.
The Haines Index is a measure of stability of atmosphere and
potential for fire growth. It ranges from zero to six.
</P>
<P>
   Udall suggested government compensation for Los Alamos residents
might prevent a long court battle over damage claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue is to what extent this was a negligent decision and
if it was, I don't think we want to be forcing people into court to
litigate those kind of things,'' he said. ''I think if it was, we
should step up and try to remedy the losses.''
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent for such a decision. A prescribed fire set by
the federal Bureau of Land Management in Northern California last
July raged out of control and destroyed 23 homes, causing $1.7
million in damage. A federal report blamed the BLM for several
lapses, including setting the blaze despite gusty winds and failing
to notify or properly protect homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   The BLM accepted responsibility and agreed to compensate
homeowners.

<HEADLINE> Willie Nelson Attacks Pork Program  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE BRANOM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- On the road again, singer and farm
activist Willie Nelson wants to end a program that makes pork
producers help pay for industry research and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ''This pork checkoff thing is something that's come along just
to add more misery,'' Nelson said. ''We're already losing 500 small
family farmers a week. But things like this just keep it impossible
for the farmer to bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, 67, is nearing the end of a two-month concert tour of
the East, Southwest and Midwest before heading to Europe in June.
He is also president of Farm Aid, which has given about $15 million
to more than 100 farm organizations, churches and service groups in
44 states.
</P>
<P>
   Hog farmers pay 45 cents for every $100 of a pig's value when it
is sold to promote research and advertising -- such as the ''other
white meat'' campaign -- in the pork industry. Producers began
paying this kind of pork ''checkoff'' fee in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the $48 million program say it has done little to
stimulate pork consumption and mostly benefits meat processors and
large, corporate farm operations.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman called a
referendum among hog farmers to see whether the program will
continue. The vote is expected later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McDowell, a hog farmer from Hampton, said farmers have been
forced to contribute to the fund even while low prices have
devastated their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's too much benefit going to the corporate producer,''
said McDowell, who raises about 500 hogs. ''They did a research
project, they spent millions to take the stink out of large
quantity of manure -- that doesn't benefit a guy like me.''
</P>
<P>
   McDowell said 250,000 hog farmers have been forced out of
business since the checkoff went into effect in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who is demanding a fair and open voting process in the
referendum, said those 250,000 farmers ''could swing an election.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joel Van Gilst, president-elect of the Iowa Pork Producers
Association, defends the checkoff program for helping fund critical
research.
</P>
<P>
   ''It goes to promotion, research and producer education,'' Van
Gilst said. ''The little guy wouldn't be able to do it by
himself.''
</P>

<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Alfalfa weevils flourishing after
Pennsylvania's mild winter could threaten $5 million to $10 million
of the state's alfalfa crop, agriculture authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   The weevils are doing the most damage in fields in the
southeastern part of the state, and agriculture authorities fear
they could also hurt the northwestern yield of the crop, which
makes hay to feed livestock, sheep and horses.
</P>
<P>
   The total annual value of the crop is estimated at $250 million,
said Marvin Hall, a Penn State University associate professor of
agronomy. He said $5 million to $10 million was a conservative
estimate for the expected loss.
</P>
<P>
   Adult or beetle weevils lay their eggs in alfalfa leaves in
fall, but many die from cold weather. Because this winter was
unusually mild, millions of offspring survived that ordinarily
would have died, said Hall.

<HEADLINE> Military May Get High School Access  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alarmed by declining recruitments, the Senate
is moving toward requiring public schools to give military
recruiters the same access to high schools that colleges and the
private sector now enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon estimates that approximately 2,000 public high
schools have policies that bar military recruiters from one or more
of the services.
</P>
<P>
   Included in a $310 billion defense bill expected to be debated
in the full Senate later this month is a provision designed to help
the Pentagon turn around declining enlistments by giving service
recruiters more access to high school students.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most schools provide their school directory to companies who
sell rings, caps and gowns and yearbooks,'' said Sen. Tim
Hutchinson, R-Ark., the principal sponsor. ''This language will
simply level the playing field between the military, college
recruiters and representatives from private industry.''
</P>
<P>
   It has bipartisan support on the Senate Armed Services
Committee, which adopted it unanimously this week. But there is no
such provision pending in the House, and the measure is opposed by
organizations representing local school boards and administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe this is a local school district matter, and not
appropriate for the federal government,'' said Reggie Felton,
director of federal relations for the National School Boards
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would make it illegal for public high schools to
discriminate against military recruiters if those high schools
allow private-sector and college representatives on campus.
</P>
<P>
   It also require military recruiters be given the same access to
''student lists and directory information'' that is extended to
colleges and private companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lack of access to high school students is the biggest problem
faced by military recruiters,'' Hutchinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to keep the military out would be if the local
school board took a specific vote to deny them access to the
school.
</P>
<P>
   As originally proposed, the legislation would have denied
federal education funds to schools that violate the proposed law.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and several other
Senate Democrats objected strenuously, and that provision was
removed.
</P>
<P>
   The fight really isn't so much about recruiting in high schools
but ''over access to students' names and addresses,'' suggested
Bruce Hunter, a spokesman for the American Association of School
Administrators.
</P>
<P>
   He said while only a relatively small number of high schools
physically bar military recruiters from their campuses, ''there's a
huge number of school districts that don't give names to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said deleting the funds cutoff provision improved the
legislation but that whether to allow military recruiters into a
high school ''should be a community decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Catherine Abbott, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said the
military services have been ''working very hard to get access to
the high schools'' but that it is often difficult.
</P>
<P>
   With year after year of declines in military recruitments --
blamed in part on the strong economy and the availability of
higher-paying private sector jobs -- the military has sweetened its
enlistment packages.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, enlistment bonuses of $5,000 or more are offered.
The Pentagon also has a program under which it will help recruits
pay for two years of college in advance of military service.
</P>
<P>
   ''Young people deserve to know all the options available to
them,'' said Hutchinson, who said many school administrators
exhibit ''an anti-military bias.''
</P>
<P>
   The provision was included in a bill authorizing Defense
Department programs for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Last year all military services except the Marine Corps failed
to meet their recruiting goals.
</P>
<P>
   Through March 2000, Pentagon figures show, the Army, Navy and
Marine Corps were on track to meet their recruitment goals for the
year, but the Air Force was meeting only 83 percent of its goal.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation in both chambers would give the military a 3.7
percent across-the-board pay increase next year -- following a 4.8
percent increase in military pay that took effect last January.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Armed Services Committee, last year there were
4,515 specific cases of denial of high school access to Army
recruiters, 4,364 instances of denial for the Navy; 4,884 cases of
denial for the Marine Corps; and 5,465 instances for the Air Force.

<HEADLINE> Zapatistas Accuse Mexico Government  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) -- Zapatista rebels have
accused the Mexican government of reactivating paramilitary groups
in indigenous villages of the poor southern state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitaries were responsible for the deaths of three
family members in the village of Polho last Sunday, said a
statement signed by seven commanders of the Zapatista National
Liberation Army. The government has accused the Zapatistas.
</P>
<P>
   ''In an irresponsible and criminal act, the government of
Chiapas blames our Zapatista bases and maintains positioned at
little distance from Polho hundreds of police and military ready to
attack,'' said the statement released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas waged a brief uprising in 1994 in the name of
Indian rights. Since then, scores of people have been killed in
clashes between rebels or their supporters and armed,
pro-government squads. Peace talks between the rebels and the
government are at a stalemate.

<HEADLINE> Gore Fighting For Women Voters  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore eats a green-pepper omelet in Margo
Strong's modest Michigan kitchen, praises her cooking and gives her
a lift to school, where he plays teacher for eight hours -- all to
underscore his commitment to public schools, child care and
universal health insurance for children.
</P>
<P>
   While the vice president has bent over backward to personify the
issues dear to women whose votes will be critical in November,
polls give him little credit for the effort.
</P>
<P>
   So do some of the women who encounter him along the presidential
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   By the final bell at Holt High last Friday, one Michigan woman
meant to be drawn in by homey images of Gore immersed in the
school's life still felt the Democrat is too disconnected to get
excited about in the way women voters rallied around Bill Clinton
in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm probably a Gore supporter but I'm still figuring it out,''
said Sue Brown, a 50-year-old homemaker who went to Holt to see
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like Gore is more above where the rest of us are, and
Clinton is more down-to-earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Among women nationally, Gore is tied with Republican George W.
Bush and antsy women activists puzzle over why Gore is not wowing
women despite a woman-friendly agenda, including proposals to
improve Social Security for homemakers and widows.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somehow, his message isn't working. It isn't getting out
there,'' said Nancy Zirkin of the American Association of
University Women.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, such as domestic violence, family medical leave
and other issues that Zirkin and fellow activists have pressed with
Gore, the message isn't out there because, while supportive, he
isn't saying much about them -- at least, not in ways that make
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-blocked reauthorization of the landmark Violence
Against Women Act has consumed feminist lobbyists for more than a
year lest battered women's shelters be crippled on Oct. 1 when
funds expire. Gore has been silent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope he will talk more about the issues that affect women's
lives,'' said Kim Gandy, executive vice president of the National
Organization for Women.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, far from yielding the megaphone, recently laid out
proposals on education, health and long-term care.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not that Al Gore is in trouble with women,'' said Frank
Luntz, an analyst for the young Republicans' YROCK.com. ''It's that
Governor Bush has an appeal among women that Republicans haven't
had in a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton beat Republican Bob Dole by 16 points among
women in 1996, while splitting the men's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''That may be the toughest thing Al Gore has to face; it looks
like George W. Bush is not going to be Bob Dole, he's just not
going to concede that terrain to Al Gore,'' said Susan Carroll,
senior research associate at the Rutgers University Center for the
American Woman and Politics.
</P>
<P>
   To wit, Bush, with a photo of him and his wife prominently
displayed, gave an interview Thursday to Lifetime, the cable
channel for women, and dispatched women members of Congress outside
the Capitol to sing his praises.
</P>
<P>
   A new Voter.com-Battleground poll shows that since March, when
Bush clinched the GOP nomination and began an appeal to moderate
swing voters, he turned a 5-point deficit among women into a
4-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   While both margins represent a statistical tie, the swing
worries Gore allies -- as do recent polls showing Bush has muted
issues where Gore counted on establishing a lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has held close on the issue of education and, in a
development unthinkable to the staunchly pro-gun control Gore camp,
is leading slightly on the issue of guns.
</P>
<P>
   Zirkin and Gandy were among a loose coalition of some 100
women's groups who met with Gore and top campaign officials at the
White House this week to talk issues and ''voice concerns,'' Gandy
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said they requested the meeting back in November ''when we
saw that the message was not getting out about what an unmitigated
disaster George W. Bush would be for women.''
</P>
<P>
   In the six months it took to land a spot on Gore's calendar,
''there has not been much progress,'' Gandy said. But she left the
meeting with ''many assurances'' from Gore and his aides that he is
determined to keep trying.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
Shalala this week joined the effort to amplify, in press
interviews, Gore's central argument that a Bush administration,
given his record as governor of Texas, would be disastrous to the
environment, public schools, health care and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are the issues that will be discussed over the course of
the next five months and 27 days,'' said Gore campaign spokesman
Chris Lehane. ''By this fall, people will know these differences
and that knowledge will translate into support for Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Gore turns to words like ''smug'' and ''arrogant'' to
describe Bush's policy stances, he walks a delicate line with
women, warned Ari Fleischer, campaign spokesman for Bush, whose own
tone has mellowed markedly since his vitriolic primary fight with
GOP Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women are going to be increasingly turned off by Al Gore's
relentless barrage of negative attacks,'' said Fleischer.

<HEADLINE> GOP Weighs Primary Schedule Changes  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Debate over a GOP plan to revamp the
presidential primary schedule could spill into the party's national
convention in Philadelphia this summer, pitting small states
against the likes of California, Texas and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we decide could decide the 2004 headlines in the
newspapers,'' Tom Sansonetti, chairman of the Republican National
Committee's rules panel, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was to vote today on a proposal to let small states
launch the nominating process by voting first in early March, with
clusters of larger states voting later through June.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who believe their states were practically shut out
of the presidential nominating process this year are backing the
proposal. Larger states oppose the plan.
</P>
<P>
   If endorsed today, final approval would be required during the
July 31-Aug. 3 convention, where delegations from larger states
would have an advantage in numbers. Those states are outnumbered,
however, on the rules panel, which debated the proposal Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rath of New Hampshire said the committee vote could be very
close, and if so, ''I don't know what kind of signal that sends to
the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   An advisory committee recommended the staggered primary schedule
as a way to give voters more time to consider candidates and a
greater say in the nomination process.
</P>
<P>
   The subject gained urgency this year after a front-loaded
calendar resulted in both parties' nominees being decided by early
March -- before half of the states had held primaries or caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the smallest states would vote no earlier than
the first Tuesday in March, with three more groups voting in
subsequent months, ending in June.
</P>
<P>
   Large states such as California, Texas and New York would hold
primaries in June, but that final group still would decide 47
percent of the delegates. The plan is to be voted on first before
deciding if Iowa and New Hampshire should keep their tradition of
going first.
</P>
<P>
   Another option the panel may consider today calls for a system
of rotating regional primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sense I get from talking to people is that the system is
so broken it demands reform,'' said Mike Hellon of Arizona, who
supports the plan although it would require moving the state's
Republican primary from February to May.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from more populous states argued against the
proposed new schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 12 largest states should not allow their voters to have
their voices stifled,'' said Barbara Alby of California, which over
the years has moved its GOP primary from June to the first Tuesday
in March. Officials there do not want to move it back, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have chosen to stay with their current system for now,
allowing Iowa and New Hampshire to go first and restricting other
states to a window from the first Tuesday in March to the second
Tuesday in June.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP panel also endorsed a rule that would allow the national
party to penalize states for not complying with the primary
schedule by stripping them of anywhere from half to 90 percent of
their convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   It backed a change that would give the national party greater
flexibility to change primary schedules between national
conventions, and rejected a recommendation that delegates be
awarded on a proportional basis.

<HEADLINE> Fire Sweeps Through Los Alamos, N.M.  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS ROBERTS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Driven by swirling wind of up 55 mph,
fire rolled from block to block in abandoned Los Alamos on
Thursday, burning scores of homes down to their foundations in the
town where the atomic bomb was built.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters doused still-standing homes with water as orange
flames and billowing smoke rose over the town. Whole neighborhoods
were reduced to smoldering ruins, with everything from trailers to
mansions going up in smoke in a fire that was set to burn brush at
Bandelier National Monument.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, the winds had diminished and were 15 to 25 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The wildfire first reached Los Alamos on Wednesday -- forcing the
evacuation of the entire town -- and exploded in size from 3,700
acres to 20,000 Thursday night, fanned by blowtorch winds so strong
they made parked cars sway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe how many homes are gone,'' said Don Shainin, a
fire battalion commander from Albuquerque who came to Los Alamos to
help.
</P>
<P>
   At the Los Alamos nuclear weapons laboratory, flames burned
trailers and portable buildings, rolled past concrete bunkers
containing explosives, and came within 300 yards of a plutonium
storage facility. But lab officials insisted that dangerous
materials were protected in fireproof facilities strong enough to
withstand the crash of a 747 jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can assure the country and New Mexico that our nuclear
materials are safe,'' said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, a
former New Mexico congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Fire crews with hand tools and bulldozers worked feverishly to
protect homes by clearing away vegetation and cutting firebreaks
ahead of the flames. Helicopters dropped water on the blaze, while
airplanes bombarded it with pink fire retardant.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 p.m. Thursday, winds had decreased-- and were expected to be
slower than predicted through the night, National Weather Service
meteorologist Kurt Von Speybroeck said. He said most winds were in
the 15- to 25-mph range.
</P>
<P>
   The fire had destroyed an estimated 260 homes and damaged 20
others in the northern and western parts of town, said Bill Lehman,
spokesman for Los Alamos County. The count included townhouses and
duplexes under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Udall, whose district includes Los Alamos, said earlier
that federal officials estimated 300 to 400 were burned.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people evacuated grew Thursday to more than
20,000, with residents to the north and northeast of Los Alamos
also fleeing the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was set May 4 by the National Park Service to clear
brush near Bandelier, but it burned out of control in the dry,
windy weather. A special National Weather Service forecast faxed to
the park beforehand said fire-growth conditions were at their
highest.
</P>
<P>
   Park Superintendent Roy Weaver has taken responsibility for the
fire. He is believed to have evacuated and has not been available
for comment about whether he saw the weather service's fax. On
Thursday, Weaver was placed on leave with pay by the Park Service
pending an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The New York Times before he was put on
leave, Weaver said: ''The data and the spot weather forecasts met
the fire prescription. It's not like someone was just picking
things out of the air.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the winds whipped up unexpectedly, and the flames began
spreading toward Los Alamos, the newspaper reported on its Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress demanded an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody made a mistake and obviously we have to find out
who,'' Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said as he visited the fire
zone.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should never have happened. That's the only thing I can say
unless you want me to curse,'' said Gail Bolger, who was forced out
of her mobile home park in Los Alamos to a shelter at a Santa Fe
high school.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever made the decision for the deliberate fire ''should have
known better,'' Bolger said. ''This is the windy season. We have it
every year, and I think he should have used his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos, 70 miles north of Albuquerque, is essentially a
company town for the weapons laboratory, which employs 7,000 people
at buildings scattered throughout the city. The town is on a mesa,
altitude 7,600 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The fire came out of the Jemez Mountains to the west and moved
northeast, torching the west and north sides of the city.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun rose Thursday, brick fireplaces and chimneys were the
only things remaining of some homes. A basketball hoop remained
intact on one driveway, its net singed but still hanging outside a
destroyed house.
</P>
<P>
   The towering ponderosa pines of the Los Alamos Canyon along the
western edge of town could be seen through the scorched shells of
homes that had been valued at more than a quarter-million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 National Guardsmen were called in to keep people out
of the evacuated zones and prevent looting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will recover,'' Richardson said. ''This has been a tragedy
for this community, but this community helped us win the Cold War,
and we're going to stand very much behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people forced to evacuate from White Rock on
Thursday had already fled Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Christensen and his wife had taken in four Los Alamos
families this week. But when the fire advanced on White Rock, they
had to load up their camper and head into a sea of cars crawling
down the highway for Santa Fe, where they planned to camp outside a
friend's house.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't ready down here,'' Christensen said. ''We were the
refugee center for our friends.''

<HEADLINE> Labor Eyes Democrat Convention  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE DeARMOND
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Democrats intent on ensuring a smooth
presidential nominating process this summer are working feverishly
to get their longtime labor allies to agree not to strike the
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   A deal is expected within weeks to guarantee that workers who
serve food and drinks and engineers who keep the downtown Staples
Center's mechanical systems humming will stay on the job. Not
covered by the agreement are union members who don't work at the
convention site.
</P>
<P>
   It's those workers and their hunger for attracting the attention
of the 15,000 journalists expected to attend the convention who
could prove embarrassing for the political party that bills itself
as the champion of working people.
</P>
<P>
   Although they don't plan to protest Democratic policies, labor
leaders are plotting high-profile demonstrations outside the
convention site and a massive march nearby by one Service Employees
International Union local that covers 45,000 Los Angeles County
government employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''The convention does loom as a tasty target for labor
disputes,'' said Geoffrey Garfield, spokesman for the Los Angeles
Police Protective League, which represents 9,500 officers and is
negotiating with the city of Los Angeles for a contract to replace
one expiring June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 14-17 convention comes on the heels of a successful
strike by janitors in Los Angeles County that has unions flying
high. Members feel empowered, invigorated and, for a rare few,
ready to challenge Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we all need to up the bar on what Democrats need to be
doing for working families,'' said Roxana Rivera-Solis, political
coordinator for the SEIU Local 1877, which staged the three-week
janitors' strike in April.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders such as Rivera-Solis see the convention as a
chance to remind Democrats to use their position to exert influence
during union disputes and to craft laws favorable to workers.
</P>
<P>
   Rod O'Connor, chief of staff for the convention, insisted the
party's relationship with labor remains strong and predicted it
will be strengthened still as the convention nears.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Democratic Party has a long history of supporting
the rights of working families,'' O'Connor said. ''If there are
events around the convention that are sponsored by labor, I believe
... they will be done in coordination with the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement under negotiation is likely to establish a
grievance procedure for union workers at the convention and
guarantee no work stoppages by them.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have a similar agreement with labor unions in
Philadelphia for the GOP convention there July 31-Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Andrew, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said
he was not worried about the possibility of labor protests outside
the meeting site.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very supportive of the rights and the causes of the men
and women of labor,'' he said. ''We are by no means overtly
troubled by this because these are our friends.''

<HEADLINE> Mayor Giuliani Shows Softer Side  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Few national political figures have sought to
keep as tight a lid on their private lives as Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   He rarely discusses his childhood. He doesn't talk about family
or friends. And what he does when he's not at City Hall is largely
a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, all that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of his disclosure two weeks ago that he is battling
prostate cancer, the mayor now is talking about the support he's
getting from a woman who isn't his wife, and confirming
long-standing rumors that his marriage is rocky.
</P>
<P>
   The recent disclosures have revealed a softer side to the
usually pugnacious mayor. They also have opened the prospective
U.S. Senate candidate up to nettlesome questions about morals.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is ex-prosecutor who has set himself up as the
tough guy moralist who won't allow breaches of the law or moral
values: A man who drinks a beer from a paper bag on his front steps
should be arrested; all strip joints and peeps shows should be
shut; the Ten Commandments should be displayed in all city schools.
</P>
<P>
   As conservative columnist Eric Fettman of the New York Post
described the mayor's vaunted high standards: ''Rudy Giuliani has
been one of the few public officials to stand head-on against those
who defiantly insist that the unchecked lowering of society's moral
standards constitutes progress.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Fettman added, ''His ability to keep doing so has now,
sadly, been undermined -- by his own behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's other side began showing two weeks ago, after he was
spotted at a hospital by a reporter acting on a tip.
</P>
<P>
   After hours of intense media speculation, the 55-year-old mayor
hastily called a City Hall news conference to say he had treatable
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the next stunner -- the Republican mayor has been
having a relationship with Judith Nathan, a divorced health
executive, whom he called a ''very good friend.'' His remarks came
only after reporters spotted Giuliani and Nathan around town.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Giuliani announced he and television personality Donna
Hanover, his wife of 16 years, were discussing separation. She made
a public statement, too, accusing the mayor of an earlier affair.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Giuliani said he was ''very sad'' about the marriage
gone awry, and he wanted to protect his children, ages 14 and 10.
He described his wife as a ''wonderful woman, wonderful mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest disclosures -- including that Giuliani took Nathan to
places as public as political meetings and the St. Patrick's Day
parade -- amount to very strange behavior in the midst of his heated
Senate race against first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Jordan, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, went so far as to say he thought the mayor was ''losing
his marbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have speculated that Giuliani secretly does not really
want to run and is sabotaging himself so he can drop out.
</P>
<P>
   And so Thursday, 26 television cameras and dozens of reporters
packed a news conference to hear whether Giuliani would indeed call
it quits.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor -- who was oddly buoyant in announcing April 27
that he had treatable prostate cancer and stunningly sober in his
declaration this week that he would seek a legal separation -- said
that he has not yet decided either way.
</P>
<P>
   He said he understood the Republican Party's need to know his
decision soon but added, ''I do not have a personal timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's new contemplative side was in evidence, as he
broached a number of topics that would have been unthinkable just
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''My concerns are my life, my personal life, my health, my
family and the other people that are involved in it, all of whom
are very decent people,'' he said. ''I'm a very fortunate human
being to have very good friends and that is how I'm getting through
all of these things.''
</P>
<P>
   His familiar combativeness was there, too.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked about his suspected philandering, Giuliani
bellowed, ''Oh get out of here! Get lost, get lost, that's a sneaky
way of trying to invade somebody's personal life. Don't you guys
have the slightest bit of decency?''
</P>
<P>
   And to those who have watched Giuliani's tough-as-nails exterior
through the years, it was almost stunning to hear his admission
that he, too, is subject to the commonest of human frailties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you cry sometimes?'' he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, of course,'' he said. ''Of course I cry.''

<HEADLINE> House OKs Land Conservation Measure  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was a lopsided vote in the House, with 315
lawmakers, a third of them Republican, signing on to a landmark
bill that would dole out billions of dollars to states for
conservation programs. Supporters say the size of the vote should
send a message to the Senate, where the bill still could be
stalled.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, passed Thursday after two days of debate, would
create a $45 billion, 15-year conservation fund to buy parks and
open spaces, pay for wildlife protection and restore
environmentally damaged coastal areas. The money would come from
federal revenue collected from oil and gas drilling leases -- about
$4 billion to $5 billion a year. Most of that money now goes into
the general treasury.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton in a statement called the House action ''a
historic step toward achieving permanent conservation funding'' and
urged the Senate ''to move swiftly on this legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome in the House was never really in doubt. Nearly two
dozen amendments were beaten back by wide margins as the bill's
sponsors worried that major changes in the legislation would
destroy the ''delicate balance'' of support.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans were divided, voting 118-93 for the bill,
supporters of the measure characterized the vote as an example of
bipartisanship. Among Democrats, the vote was 196-8 with two
independents splitting on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Senate is going to be hard pressed not to pass this
legislation,'' Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, beamed to reporters after
Thursday's vote. Young had ignored opposition from property rights
groups, and along with Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., led the charge
for the bill's passage.
</P>
<P>
   That the two lawmakers would show such unity was itself a shock
to many congressional observers. Young, a vocal foe of
environmentalists, and Miller, a favorite of green groups, over the
years have clashed repeatedly over environmental legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics called the House-passed bill green pork because it
calls for distributing $3 billion a year -- at least $8.9 million
for each state -- for a broad range of conservation measures, from
buying private parcels trapped within federal land to rebuilding
eroded beaches and setting aside parts of suburbia for bike trails
and soccer fields.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska, California, Texas and Louisiana would be the big
winners, getting about a third of the $3 billion a year. No wonder,
say the critics. Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., a staunch defender of
property rights, became one of the bill's leading cheerleaders.
Louisiana stands to get $311 million a year and Alaska $163
million.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is the most ambitious environmental legislation before
the Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the single most significant commitment our nation has
ever made to investments in wildlife and wild places. The benefits
will be felt in every state for generations to come,'' Mark Van
Putten, president of the National Wildlife Federation, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But its prospects in the Senate are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the Energy and
Natural Resources Committee, said he wants to ''use the momentum of
this House success'' and plans to take up the bill next month. But
he warned that even within his committee he expected stiff
opposition from a number of senators worried about a government
rush to buy private land.
</P>
<P>
   ''There must be safeguards against unbridled government
acquisitions,'' said Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., who is on the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Young and Miller believe the strong House vote -- and support for
the legislation from the White House -- will sway senators. So will
the tens of millions of dollars annually that will go to states,
counties and towns for land purchases and other conservation
measures.
</P>
<P>
   But the property rights issue is not expected to go away.
</P>
<P>
   Young argued that the bill provides new protections against the
federal government taking land. It also will pour millions of
federal dollars into conservation easements, which can be used to
help ranchers and farmers keep their land away from developers.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the legislation is a requirement that the
36-year-old Land and Water Conservation Fund be completely spent at
$900 million a year, tripling money for federal and state land
purchases. Created in 1964, the fund was supposed to be used
exclusively for conservation, but for years has been raided by
Congress to pay for other federal programs.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Congress Wrestles With Compensation  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is wrestling with the Clinton
administration's plan to compensate every radiation-exposed,
cancer-stricken nuclear weapons factory worker, living and dead.
</P>
<P>
   For lawmakers, it means decisions both financial and moral:
What's a fair payment for a shortened life or ruined health? What
should determine who gets paid and who doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   ''These are people's lives we're talking about. No amount of
money can make up for that, but we've got to do as much as we can
to help these people,'' said Rep. Ted Strickland, D-Ohio, whose
district includes the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant, an Energy
Department facility where uranium is processed for nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's plan offers $100,000 lump sum payments only
to those who contracted cancer and beryllium disease, and steers
other sick employees to state workers' compensation programs. It
would not allow compensated workers to sue the government or
government contractors for further damages.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the estimated 3,000 workers who would be in line for
federal payments worked at the Hanford Reservation in Washington
state; the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee; the Savannah River
Site in South Carolina; the Nevada Test Site; the Rocky Flats
Environmental Technology Site in Colorado; the Pantex Plant in
Texas; the Fernald and Mound plants in Ohio; and the gaseous
diffusion plants in Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   At all those facilities, the government now acknowledges,
secrecy often was more important than safety during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Workers have described being sent into highly radioactive areas
without any film in their radiation-measuring film badges; going
without lung protection into areas where contaminants created a
thick fog; and eating their lunches on the same tabletops where
they wiped down leaking chemical containers.
</P>
<P>
   Some spent years trying to get accurate information on their
medical conditions but got documents with the identity of what they
were exposed to blacked out for security reasons. In some cases,
exposure records were altered or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Ray, a disabled former employee at the Portsmouth plant,
said he and other production workers were never told about
plutonium and other contaminants in the uranium they were
processing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Information was provided based on a 'need to know' basis -- and
production imperatives determined what you needed to know,'' he
told a recent congressional hearing. ''Even to this day, we don't
know what we confronted.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Slesinger, a University of Pittsburgh economics professor
who frequently testifies in lawsuits, calculating dollar figures to
help set damages for injured people, said he could imagine few
instances in which the administration's compensation offer would be
adequate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who takes the $100,000 is foolish,'' he said. ''They're
being hoodwinked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless someone worked up until the day he died, lost wages
alone would probably be more than that. Three years of lost wages
is over $100,000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Slesinger said the minimum should be $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most generous packages being devised on Capitol Hill
don't go that far. Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, and Rep. Ed
Whitfield, R-Ky., introduced legislation this week to make the
minimum payment $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers say they expect some kind of compensation program
to pass, but expect long negotiations to determine the price tag
and a way to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress appropriates billions of dollars annually on things
that are not the responsibility of the federal government,''
Voinovich said. ''Here we have a clear instance where our federal
government is responsible for the actions it has taken and the
negligence it has shown against its own people.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not only a responsibility of this government to provide
for these individuals, it is a moral obligation.''

<HEADLINE> Giuliani, who plays things close to vest, is forced to air his dirty linen </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Few national political figures have sought to
keep as tight a lid on their private lives as Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani. He rarely discusses his childhood. He doesn't talk about
family or friends. And what he does when he's not at City Hall is
largely a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly all that has changed. Giuliani -- who set himself up
as the tough guy moralist who won't allow breaches of the law or
moral values -- is talking about the support he's getting from a
woman not his wife and confirming long-standing rumors his marriage
is rocky.
</P>
<P>
   It started two weeks ago when a reporter acting on a tip spotted
Giuliani, 55, at a hospital. After several hours of intense media
speculation, Giuliani hastily called a City Hall news conference
and, with television cameras rolling, told the city that he had
treatable prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the next stunner -- the Republican mayor has been
having a relationship with Judith Nathan, a divorced health
executive, whom he called a ''very good friend.'' His remarks came
only after reporters spotted Giuliani and Nathan around town.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Giuliani announced he and television personality Donna
Hanover, his wife of 16 years, were talking about separation. She
made a public statement, too, accusing the mayor of an earlier
affair.
</P>
<P>
   In his public statements, Giuliani said he was ''very sad''
about the marriage gone awry. It was ''very painful.'' He wanted to
protect his children, ages 14 and 10. His wife was a ''wonderful
woman, wonderful mother.''
</P>
<P>
   While the recent disclosures have revealed a softer side to the
usually pugnacious mayor, they have also opened the prospective
U.S. Senate candidate up to nettlesome questions about morals.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is an ex-prosecutor who doesn't stand for moral
funny business. A man who drinks a beer from a paper bag on his
front steps should be arrested. All strip joints and peeps shows
should be shut. The Ten Commandments should be displayed in all
city schools.
</P>
<P>
   As conservative columnist Eric Fettman of the New York Post
described the mayor's vaunted high standards: ''Rudy Giuliani has
been one of the few public officials to stand head-on against those
who defiantly insist that the unchecked lowering of society's moral
standards constitutes progress.''

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 103, Jazz 84  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Portland Trail Blazers are playing so
well, so loose, that Damon Stoudamire sees nothing taboo about
openly discussing a four-game sweep of the once-mighty Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why not? Let's go out and try to win Game 4,'' Stoudamire said
after the Blazers built a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference
semifinals with a 103-84 victory over Utah on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're one step away,'' he said. ''We're going to come in here
on Sunday and try to take that game, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Arvydas Sabonis scored 22 points, Steve Smith had 21 and reserve
Bonzi Wells had 10 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter, leaving
Utah one game from being swept in a best-of-seven series for the
first time in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's strange for the whole organization,'' said Karl Malone,
who scored 28 points, but was held to two in the fourth quarter.
''We've never been down like this, that I can recall.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz are reeling, another perfect part of the Blazers'
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we allowed this team to win this game, I think they'd feel
like they could win the series,'' said Portland's Scottie Pippen.
''This game has put some doubts into their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the Jazz, who played for the NBA title in 1997 and
1998, are a bad team. The Blazers are simply deeper, bigger
throughout the lineup and playing much better right now.
</P>
<P>
   ''After beating Utah to go up 3-0, we have a right to be
confident,'' said Portland forward Detlef Schrempf.
</P>
<P>
   Game 4 is at the Delta Center on Sunday, with Utah trying to
become the first team in NBA history to rally from a 3-0 deficit.
The odds don't favor it, and the Jazz sounded like they knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sunday is just a pride game for me,'' Malone said. ''I don't
think anyone wants to end the year getting swept.''
</P>
<P>
   The capacity crowd of 19,911 was boisterous much of the second
half after Utah rallied from a 21-point second-quarter deficit.
</P>
<P>
   But Jazz fans cleared out with three minutes on the
fourth-quarter clock, after the Blazers opened the period with an
11-2 run and pulled away for their third blowout victory in the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I was in the crowd, I'd have left, too,'' said Jeff
Hornacek, who scored 24 points on 9-of-17 shooting. ''If we'd have
lost these games by one or two or four, I'd think there would be
more hope.''
</P>
<P>
   With Portland's post-up offense dictating the pace, the Blazers
took a 53-32 lead with 4:50 before halftime. Some fans booed and it
seemed to spur the Jazz, who closed the half with a 17-2 run for a
55-49 halftime deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Utah kept it close in the third, three times tying the score.
But the Jazz never could get the lead, and Portland put it out of
reach by outscoring Utah 28-14 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they cut it to six or seven, it was anybody's ball
game,'' said Blazers forward Brian Grant. ''But I think they used
up a lot of energy coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace scored 17 points for the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Bryon Russell had 18 points for the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Utah had beaten Portland in 10 of the previous 13 playoff games
in Salt Lake City, but the Blazers weren't intimidated. Now,
they've won 10 of their last 12 overall against the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I know is it's 3-0 in the series,'' backup point guard
Greg Anthony said. ''That team is too good for us to allow any
complacency to creep in on our part. We've got to play even better
on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   That's scary, because the Blazers, who beat Utah in six games
last year in the Western Conference semifinals, have made it look
easy this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're desperate,'' Russell said. ''If we don't come out and
win, then it's bye-bye.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: On Sunday, Pippen will tie Magic Johnson, at 190, for third
place on the NBA's list of career playoff appearances. ... By the
end of the first quarter, six players had two fouls: Stoudamire,
Wallace, Sabonis, Grant, Olden Polynice and John Stockton. ...
Portland hasn't swept a best-of-seven series since 1976-77, the
year the Blazers won the NBA title. ... Portland came in 0-6 in
Game 3s of a best-of-seven series.

<HEADLINE> Conn. Bishop To Succeed O'Connor  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mixing a dry Irish wit with conservative church
doctrine, Bishop Edward Egan arrived here to assume the mantle of
the late Cardinal John O'Connor and the spiritual leadership of 2.4
million Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Egan, who for 12 years led 367,000 Catholics in the diocese of
Bridgeport, Conn., was selected Thursday by the pope to head the
New York Archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel like the boss,'' he joked with reporters at a
news conference. ''But give me a little time and I will.''
</P>
<P>
   The 68-year-old bishop is an uncompromising defender of
traditional Vatican teachings. When asked about abortion and birth
control, Egan backed the pope's opposition to both, as he has done
staunchly during his career. Asked by a Vatican radio reporter
whether he would be pro-life, Egan answered in both English and
Italian.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all the enthusiasms and insistence and light that I can
possibly add, the answer is yes,'' he said. ''Without any question,
yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan will become the 12th archbishop of New York when he is
formally installed June 19. He is also widely expected to be
elevated to cardinal by Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Egan said he hoped to gain the same acceptance in New York that
the Philadelphia-born O'Connor achieved during his 16 years in the
church's most prominent American pulpit. O'Connor died last week of
a brain tumor at age 80.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can tell you there is no place in the world that is quicker
to accept someone who wants to be a New Yorker,'' said Egan, who
worked in the New York Archdiocese earlier in his career. ''I want
to be a New Yorker, and I guess I am officially one.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bridgeport, Egan won acclaim for reorganizing diocesan
schools and recruiting local men for the priesthood. He also raised
millions of dollars in his annual bishop's appeal in the diocese,
which embraces Fairfield County, one of the nation's richest
counties.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's an imposing figure and a great preacher,'' said Monsignor
Timothy Dolan, an American who heads the North American Pontifical
College in Rome. Egan studied there after his 1957 ordination.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the similarity to O'Connor, Dolan added, ''When Ed Egan
walks into a room, he doesn't go unnoticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Pieczynski, spokeswoman for the Chicago-based church
reform group Call to Action, described Egan as ''very
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My understanding is that he is very personable, but also very
rigid in his approach to issues,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Oak Park, Ill., Egan studied theology at Rome's
Gregorian Pontifical University. He served from 1971 to 1985 on the
Vatican tribunal that decides such matters as whether to grant
annulments.
</P>
<P>
   In Bridgeport, Egan came under fire for defending the diocese
against more than two dozen lawsuits over alleged sexual
molestation by priests. Although all but one of the cases preceded
Egan's arrival, they raised tough questions over whether abuse was
covered up.

<HEADLINE> Africa Trade Bill Clears Congress  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six years after the last big trade bill and
just two weeks before a crucial House vote on China trade, Congress
is sending the White House major trade legislation to make it
easier for sub-Saharan Africa and Caribbean nations to sell their
goods in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both the administration and Congress have shown their deep
commitment to a revitalized Africa,'' said U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky, praising the rare confluence of
opinion on foreign trade policy.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which took some five years to move through
Congress, passed on a 77-19 Senate vote Thursday after a House vote
of 309-110 last year.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he was eager to sign legislation that
''will encourage these nations to continue building open economies,
bolster their efforts to alleviate poverty and improve long-term
prospects for democracy and stability around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The African diplomatic corps in Washington unanimously endorsed
the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. ''It makes sense out of the
fact that there must be other ways beyond foreign aid. You are
putting people to work and it's been proved that the magic of the
marketplace can do wonders,'' said Chitmansing Jesseramsing,
ambassador from Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, nations that meet certain human rights and labor
standards would enjoy duty-free and quota-free status for shipments
to the United States of apparel made with U.S. yarn and fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing made in Africa from African fabric would be allowed to
rise from 1.5 percent of U.S. imports to 3.5 percent over eight
years, boosting African exports of these products from about $250
million a year now to as much as $4.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   African nations where the gross domestic product is less than
$1,500 a year per person, all but six of the 48 sub-Saharan
nations, would have four years of quota-free benefits for apparel
made with third-country fabric.
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of Caribbean nations helps level the trade playing
field that tilted in Mexico's favor after the North American Free
Trade Agreement went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky said it was the first major trade legislation to be
approved by Congress since a 1994 bill that led to the creation of
the World Trade Organization. Since then the White House and the
Republican-led Congress have frequently been at odds on such issues
as fast-track negotiating authority for the president, the Kyoto
treaty on greenhouses gases and the chaotic WTO meeting in Seattle
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something we should take a moment and relish,'' said
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. He called the bill ''a
significant step forward in our trade policy and a victory for free
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., a senior member of the
Congressional Black Caucus and a chief sponsor, said that ''at
last, like other ethnic groups in America, African Americans will
be able to point to a special partnership that connects the United
States to our ancestral homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Both members of Congress and the administration also said they
hoped impetus from the Africa trade vote would boost the chances
for passage of what is expected to be a close House vote this month
on putting U.S. trade relations with China on a permanent status.
</P>
<P>
   But the legislation also had its detractors, led by lawmakers
from textile industry states who warned of losing American jobs,
those wanting provisions to forgive African debt and others angered
that the final bill dropped language making it easier for
AIDS-devastated Africa to get cheaper drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless we get serious about reducing Africa's debt burden and
fighting the region's devastating HIV/Aids crisis, any effort to
stimulate trade and investment is simply an act of political
theater,'' said Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., who with Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., unsuccessfully tried to get AIDS language in
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded to that omission Wednesday by issuing an
executive order making clear that the U.S. government will not
stand in the way of efforts by African states to get cheaper
generic AIDS drugs.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Book Questions Ancestry of CT Tribe  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASHANTUCKET, Conn. (AP) -- A new book about the Mashantucket
Pequots, one of the nation's smallest and richest Indian tribes,
has opened centuries-old wounds in the wooded, rolling hills of
eastern Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   In ''Without Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful
Indian Tribe and Foxwoods, the World's Largest Casino,'' author
Jeff Benedict says the present-day Pequot tribe members are not
blood relatives of the historic tribe that was nearly exterminated
in a 17th-century war.
</P>
<P>
   The book also says Connecticut congressmen and state lawmakers
were duped into allowing the tribe to open Foxwoods, one world's
most profitable gambling palaces.
</P>
<P>
   The Pequots and some researchers say the book is an unfair
attack against a legitimate Indian tribe that has suffered for
centuries through war, disease, slavery and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are a proud people, and we will not stand by and cater to
anyone who may be racist or jealous of our hard work and success,''
Tribal Council Chairman Kenneth Reels said in a letter this week to
tribal members.
</P>
<P>
   Reels' letter said the tribal council is discussing how to
respond to the book, but did not elaborate. A spokesman for Reels
declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Some who live around the reservation, upset that their bucolic
corner of Connecticut has been transformed by towering hotels and
shiny limousines, see the book as vindication of their complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the tribe is not a bona fide tribe, then they should not be
operating a casino,'' said Ledyard Mayor Wesley Johnson. ''We don't
expect 13,000 people to be out of work or to see property boarded
up ... but something should be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pequots have never disclosed their finances, but analysts
speculate Foxwoods takes in about $1 billion a year. The tribe says
the casino draws about 50,000 people a day.
</P>
<P>
   The Mashantucket Pequots were decimated by a 1637 war with
European colonists and neighboring tribes. The tribe dwindled
further over the centuries, and at one point there was just one
resident on the Pequot reservation, Elizabeth George.
</P>
<P>
   The book tells how her grandson, Skip Hayward, worked to get the
tribe federal recognition by an act of Congress in 1983.
Recognition brought the sovereignty the tribe needed to build
Foxwoods in Ledyard.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other eastern tribes, the Pequots did not go through the
Bureau of Indian Affairs recognition process, which includes deep
probes of genealogy and history.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict notes that Hayward and his family identified themselves
on marriage licenses and birth certificates as white -- until, he
says, they recognized ''the legal advantage of forming a tribe.''
</P>
<P>
   Benedict isn't alone in his skepticsm.
</P>
<P>
   Another book about the Pequots, by Kim Eisler, an editor at
Washingtonian magazine, is to be published in February. ''Revenge
of the Pequots: A Tiny Tribe's Billion-Dollar Gamble'' expresses
wariness about the tribe, but finds there is evidence to support
their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers side firmly with the Pequots, including
Laurence M. Hauptman, a history professor at State University of
New York at New Paltz. Hauptman has written a dozen books about
American Indians and helped edit a 1990 book about the Pequots.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this Benedict fellow were in my class, I wouldn't pass him
for the type of research he did,'' Hauptman said.
</P>
<P>
   The book ignores important facts, including a Civil War pension
record for one of Hayward's ancestors that identifies him as a
full-blooded Pequot, Hauptman said.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict stands by his book, which he said is based on 650
interviews and thousands of documents and news articles. Tribal
leaders refused to talk to him, but he said he talked with numerous
members on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   He said if the modern-day Pequots really are descended from the
historic tribe, all they have to do if show their proof.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Indian Affairs said it would look into the book's
claims, but bureau communications director Rex Hackler said the
book ''looks like a repeat of the same old story.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be better if everyone in that area could find a way
to get along instead playing this out in the newspaper,'' he said.

Accused Scientist Challenges Govt.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Defense attorneys have challenged prosecutors to
name the foreign nation for which fired Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee sought
to secure a benefit, as alleged in federal charges against him. Lee, 60, a
naturalized U.S. citizen from Taiwan, was fired last year by Los Alamos National
Laboratory and accused of 59 counts of breaching lab security by transferring
files from secure to unsecure computers and to computer tapes. Lee is not
accused of espionage. But for the government to win a conviction on the most
serious charges against him, prosecutors must prove he copied weapons secrets to
portable data tapes with the intent of injuring the United States or giving a
foreign nation an advantage.

setting up shop online to let consumers compare physicians' bids for their
business. Consumers can log on, enter their medical profile and list what
procedure they want. The online services match the requests with participating

Firefighters rushed to save houses as orange flames and billowing smoke rose

<HEADLINE> Moderate Quake Shakes S. Turkey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- A moderate earthquake hit southern Turkey
on Friday, sending residents of the town of Osmaniye into the
streets or jumping from balconies in panic.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials said a woman was treated for broken legs and
arms after she jumped out of her third-floor apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The epicenter of the quake was near Osmaniye, 350 miles
southeast of Ankara, according to Istanbul's Kandilli Observatory.
Most people were asleep when the magnitude 4.8 quake hit at 6:01
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The quake caused cracks in the walls of some houses while
damaging the minarets of at least two mosques, the Anatolia news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office was trying to determine the damage.
</P>
<P>
   The quake struck four days after a magnitude 4.5 quake damaged
200 houses in the town of Puturge, further east. Puturge lies on
the East Anatolian fault, which also extends to the east of
Osmaniye.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Turkey lies on another fault, the North Anatolian, the
source of two strong earthquakes that leveled parts of northwestern
Turkey in August and November, killing more than 18,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Gun Rallies for Mother's Day  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Joy Livingston, the Michigan coordinator for a
national gun control rally on Mother's Day, said she had no
expectation that President Clinton would accept an invitation to
her delegation's reception in Washington on Saturday -- the eve of
the ''Million Mom March.''
</P>
<P>
   The president didn't accept. Instead, he invited the Plainwell,
Mich., resident and about 1,000 other organizers to his house --
that is, the White House lawn. Clinton will address the group
Sunday morning, before the participants head to the National Mall
to join a mass rally designed to urge lawmakers to approve
licensing and registration of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just got an e-mail to be at the White House,'' an excited
Livingston said Thursday. ''I can't picture a better Mother's
Day.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, a major supporter of gun control, will not
address the march. The White House cited security concerns, and the
president said he did not want to steal the limelight from the
organizers -- most of them mothers who had not been activists, but
were upset about gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the march could motivate Congress to pass more gun
control measures, Clinton said, ''I don't know, but it ought to.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said that ''if a couple hundred thousand people
show up here and several hundred thousand at these sites around the
country it ought to send a signal that we want America to be a safe
country and common sense gun legislation is part of the strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, running for the Senate from New York,
will be among the marchers. Vice President Al Gore, who wants to
move up into Clinton's job, was to baby-sit his grandson Wyatt on
Sunday so that his wife, Tipper, and their daughter, Karenna, could
join the march.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration is really a series of rallies on Mother's Day
in more than 70 communities. The main rally in Washington will
feature entertainers, politicians and victims of gun violence
telling their personal stories.
</P>
<P>
   The rally will have competition from a pro-gun organization,
Second Amendment Sisters, which plans speeches on the Washington
Monument grounds and a march to the Capitol on Sunday. The event is
independent of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled as the keynote speaker for the self-defense advocacy
group is Texas state Rep. Suzanna Gratia-Hupp. Nearly a decade ago,
she was a patron in a restaurant in Killeen, Texas, when an armed
man entered and killed 21 people, including her parents.
</P>
<P>
   Gratia-Hupp has said that if she had been allowed by law to
carry her legally owned sidearm into the restaurant, she would have
been able to stop the man with a clear shot from less than 5 yards
away.
</P>
<P>
   Three-fourths of women surveyed in a new Gallup poll said they
support more strict gun controls, compared with about half of the
men questioned.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 1,031 adults was taken May 5-7 and has an error
margin of 3 percentage points, larger for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Source: Knight May Be Asked To Quit  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE WILSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Bob Knight's once rock-solid support at
Indiana University might be eroding amid an avalanche of
accusations that he has long intimidated students, staff and school
officials.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking school official told The Associated Press that
university trustees are weighing whether to ask Knight to resign
rather than continue an investigation and risk a showdown that
could lead to his firing.
</P>
<P>
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity after talking
to several trustees, said the decision could be ''tantamount to
dismissal.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of Knight's players say they will leave the program if
he is forced out, an athletic department spokesman said late
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our players became very upset today, and told me they were
tired of being quiet. They don't want to see things tried in the
media,'' Todd Starowitz said. ''To a man, everyone supports Coach
Knight.''
</P>
<P>
   The nine-member board of trustees will meet Sunday, apparently
to decide whether to expand an investigation of Knight, who has
been accused of physical and verbal abuse during his 29 years as
Indiana's basketball coach. The probe is expected to be completed
by mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the latest damaging allegations to emerge, Knight is
accused of throwing a vase near the secretary to the athletic
director 12 years ago, shattering it against a glass-framed picture
on an office door.
</P>
<P>
   In another incident, the Chicago Sun-Times reported Thursday
that Knight attacked former assistant coach Ron Felling last Nov.
30 after overhearing him talk about problems with the program. The
two had to be separated, the newspaper said, and Felling left the
team five days later.
</P>
<P>
   A third incident surfaced when Indianapolis television station
WRTV reported Thursday that Knight attacked sports information
director Kit Klingelhoffer 10 years ago during a confrontation over
a news release. Klingelhoffer was knocked out, the station
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mounting evidence against Knight, some people at the
school believe he will keep his job, and many of his former players
still support him.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all the things he's done for this university, and with
his record over the years and the kinds of players he's produced, I
can't imagine that this hullabaloo will amount to anything,'' said
Edgar Williams, Indiana's former vice president and chief financial
officer and Knight's close friend throughout his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   University vice president Christopher Simpson said the trustees
have made no decision about whether to ask Knight to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have not reached a conclusion. To suggest otherwise is
incorrect,'' Simpson told the AP on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If the Knight investigation is expanded, it could include the
accusation about the vase, which reveals as much about him as it
does the campus culture that has loved, feared and tolerated him
for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Venting his fury at the athletic director at the time, the late
Ralph Floyd, Knight allegedly grabbed a vase in the office of
Floyd's administrative assistant and flung it across the tiny room,
shattering the glass on a framed picture.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces of glass and porcelain flew in front of the
administrative assistant, Jeanette Hartgraves, as she recoiled in
terror.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hadn't been here too long and I didn't know what to do,''
said Hartgraves, who holds the same position under current athletic
director Clarence Doninger. ''I was frightened to see someone that
mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartgraves spoke of that unreported episode reluctantly, only to
correct certain details after a faculty member mentioned it in an
interview regarding the current probe of Knight's conduct by the
university's board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not supposed to be talking to the press,'' she said.
''But I've seen his temper other times ... the shouting and the
cursing, things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight, who refused to be interviewed by The AP while under
investigation, never apologized and never was reprimanded,
Hartgraves said. Nothing about the thrown vase, the danger it posed
to Hartgraves, or the insubordination to the athletic director was
put in Knight's file.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just put aside,'' Hartgraves said, indicating that no
one in the athletic department wanted to challenge Knight's
standing at the university shortly after he won his third NCAA
championship in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   It's just the latest in a series of accusations against one of
the nation's best known and most successful coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Former player Neil Reed accused Knight of choking him in
practice three years ago; Knight reportedly once brandished soiled
toilet paper ''to motivate'' his team; and Butch Carter, a former
player and now the Toronto Raptors' coach, said Knight told a black
player in 1980 that he would end up like ''all the rest of the
niggers in Chicago.'' Other players there at the time have said
they never heard Knight use the racial slur.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's alleged outburst in Hartgraves' office reveals the type
of behavior that other faculty members argue is against the
university's code of conduct and would lead to their dismissal or
reprimand if they acted the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been one set of rules for everyone in this university
and another set for Bob Knight,'' said Murray Sperber, an English
professor, author of three books on college sports and Knight's
most vocal critic among Indiana faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Hartgraves told the Indianapolis Star that in February 1998 she
received a call from Knight's secretary asking if the coach could
speak to someone who was in a budget meeting with Doninger. When
Hartgraves asked if she could tell the person what the matter
concerned, Knight got on the phone and swore at her, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hartgraves said Knight then slammed down the telephone and
stormed into the waiting area in Doninger's office. She said Knight
called her other expletives and advanced toward her in anger before
Doninger restrained him.
</P>
<P>
   Doninger said he was present during the encounter but declined
to discuss it further.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to comment on anything related to the
investigation until it is complete,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees also are examining whether Knight intimidated
Doninger, and nearly came to blows with him following a loss to
Ohio State in February.

<HEADLINE> Marlins Win One for the Ages  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The Florida Marlins got a win for the ages.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With their pitching staff depleted by injuries, 23-year-old
Jason Grilli and 37-year-old Joe Strong, both making their
big-league debuts, combined to pitch eight innings as Florida
overcame a triple play and beat the Atlanta Braves 5-4 on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was great,'' manager John Boles said. ''Those two guys
gave us everything we had to have. It was just perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong pitched 1 1-3 hitless innings as he became the oldest
player to make his major league debut in nearly 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't slept a wink,'' said Strong, who arrived on an
overnight flight after being recalled from Triple-A Calgary. ''The
way things went tonight, I'll probably never sleep again.''
</P>
<P>
   Grilli, 14 years younger than Strong, allowed 15 baserunners --
11 hits, two walks and two hit batsmen -- but only four runs in 6
2-3 innings. He also singled on the first pitch in his first career
at-bat and drove in a run on a fourth-inning groundout.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted my whole life to be here,'' said Grilli, who was sent
back to Calgary after the game. ''To do as well as I did, it's a
great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games, it was Milwaukee 14, Chicago 8; Cincinnati 11,
San Diego 9; Philadelphia 6, Montreal 4; and New York 3, Pittsburgh
2.
</P>
<P>
   When Strong entered the game in the seventh inning, he became
the oldest player to make his big league debut since Diomedes Olivo
on Sept. 5, 1960, for Pittsburgh at age 41.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was so happy when he took the mound, I almost started
tearing up out there,'' said teammate Preston Wilson, who hit a
two-run homer. ''That's just perseverance.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the two rookies, the Braves' first triple play since
1986 became a footnote. They went around the horn on Mike Lowell's
grounder to third in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   With runners at first and second, Lowell hit a grounder that
third baseman Chipper Jones backhanded. He stepped on third, then
threw to second baseman Quilvio Veras, whose relay to first was
backhanded on one hop by Andres Galarraga. Lowell was out by less
than half a step.
</P>
<P>
   The only other pitcher available for the Marlins was Antonio
Alfonseca, who pitched the ninth for his 11th save, giving Florida
three wins in the four-game series.
Brewers 14, Cubs 8:
</P>
<P>
   Mark Loretta went 5-for-5 and Jeromy Burnitz had three RBIs as
Milwaukee won the longest nine-inning game in National League
history.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-hour, 22-minute game at Wrigley Field featured 35 hits and
19 walks as the teams tied the major league record for a
nine-inning game set by Baltimore and the Yankees in a 13-9 game on
Sept. 5, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The longest previous NL game took 4 hours, 20 minutes, between
Los Angeles and Colorado on June 30, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   David Weathers, the 10th pitcher, struck out Sammy Sosa with the
bases loaded on the 427th pitch of the game to finish it.
Reds 11, Padres 9:
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Boone's two-run homer with one out in the ninth off Matt
Whisenant (2-2) finished off a deflating day for San Diego, which
completed only its third 0-6 road trip in the franchise's 32-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   Boone's brother, Bret, had two home runs for the Padres,
including an inside-the-park job.
Phillies 6, Expos 4:
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Michael Barrett's error with two outs in the
seventh inning allowed the go-ahead run to score for visiting
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Wolf (2-2) allowed four runs -- three earned -- in six
innings as the Phillies won for the sixth time in their last eight
games.
Mets 3, Pirates 2:
</P>
<P>
   Al Leiter (4-0) pitched an eight-hitter and Todd Zeile had a
solo homer and two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had lost 10 of 14 and were 4-8 on a season-long 13-game
road trip until Leiter pitched his first complete game of the
season.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Guerrillas attacked Israeli-allied
militiamen in southern Lebanon on Friday, killing one and wounding
another, Lebanese security officials said. The attacks provoked
Israeli shelling.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas fired rockets and mortar shells at four outposts
manned by militiamen of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army in a
southern Lebanon border enclave held by Israel, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded militiaman was airlifted to Israel for treatment,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks,
to which Israeli troops and SLA militiamen responded by firing at
suspected guerrilla hide-outs near villages on the edge of the
enclave, the officials said. There were no reports of casualties
from the shelling.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army acknowledged the death of an SLA
man and that another was wounded in Friday's fighting.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli army statement also said Israeli warplanes attacked
''terrorist targets'' in areas outside the occupied zone Thursday
night. The airstrikes were apparently in response to attacks by
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas on Israeli and SLA outposts in
the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, an SLA militiaman was killed in a Hezbollah attack.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading the campaign to oust
Israeli troops and the SLA from the border enclave held by the
Jewish state since 1985 as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla
attacks on its northern towns.
</P>
<P>
   Israel plans to withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon by
July.

<HEADLINE> FBI: Foreign Agents Have Access  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says she
will look into an FBI disclosure that foreign spies working under
cover as news correspondents are able to move about the State
Department unescorted.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony Thursday by Timothy Bereznay, an FBI section
chief, before the House International Relations Committee caught
Albright and President Clinton by surprise. It also came amid
concern over security at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously we don't want spies posing as journalists,''
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has given top priority to tightening security at the
department following a series of security lapses over the past two
years. The most serious occurred this past winter with the
disappearance of a laptop computer containing highly sensitive
information about weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   Bereznay implied that some of the foreign agents with press
credentials represented hostile powers.
</P>
<P>
   He said the FBI, in order to protect sources and sensitive
cases, does not customarily provide other agencies with lists of
intelligence officer identities.
</P>
<P>
   ''If asked, the FBI would be willing to identify to the State
Department permanent media badge holders identified as hostile
intelligence officers so that their access could be restricted or
their visits monitored,'' Bereznay said.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI issued a statement Thursday night that directly
contradicted that section of Bereznay's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FBI coordinates closely with the Bureau of Diplomatic
Security, Department of State, on all security issues,'' it said.
''The FBI shares information with them whether or not we are
specifically asked. If the FBI is in possession of any information
of that nature, we would share it with the State Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern about foreign correspondents who cover the State
Department had receded following the end of the Cold War. More than
a decade ago, the Reagan administration decreed that East Bloc
reporters be required to have an escort.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran correspondents also recalled a case about 15 years ago
when the State Department expelled a Soviet reporter who
acknowledged to a neighbor, in an apparently unguarded moment, that
he also worked as a spy.
</P>
<P>
   Bereznay said that over the past 15 years, no foreign
intelligence service officer under media cover has been declared
persona non grata for engaging in espionage activities because such
agents do not have diplomatic immunity and normally avoid such
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's disclosure was a setback for Albright, who has been
hoping to put the furor over security lapses behind her.
</P>
<P>
   There has been sharp criticism from Capitol Hill about the
problem but it has been directed more at the perceived lax security
culture at the department than at Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary of State David Carpenter acknowledged that
all media have unescorted access to the first two floors of the
State Department but said there are no assurances that access above
the second floor cannot be gained.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it was within my power, I would not have any press in the
building,'' Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said there are 467 Americans with
department press credentials and 56 foreign media.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani fights speculation that he's about to drop Senate bid  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Top state Republican officials say Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani just needs some time to deal with his crumbling marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat surprisingly, the sentiment is echoed by some of the
mayor's most vocal critics, namely his U.S. Senate opponent,
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't think anyone should comment on what they're going
through,'' Clinton said on NBC's ''Today'' show. ''I'm going to,
out of respect for him and his family, have nothing to say about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the public show of support from fellow Republicans seems to
be just that. Behind the scenes, plans are already being made to
back another Senate candidate should the mayor end his campaign.
And some potential alternative candidates are coming out publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Giuliani fought back Thursday, claiming he isn't going
away just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made no decision yet to drop out of the Senate race,'' he
insisted when confronted at a news conference with reports he would
quit. ''I didn't discuss that with anyone. I didn't say that to
anyone. I didn't think about it yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's latest statements came a day after he announced that
he and his wife of 16 years, Donna Hanover, are discussing a legal
separation. Hanover responded by dropping her own bombshell,
alleging that their marital woes began over his relationship with a
former press aide, Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover also told reporters that just as she and the mayor began
to reconcile, he took up with a third woman. Giuliani has
acknowledged an ongoing relationship with a health care executive,
Judith Nathan, whom he called a ''very good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, the mayor lashed out at reporters who shouted
questions about the alleged affairs. ''Don't you guys have the
slightest bit of decency?'' he scolded. ''Shhhh! Do you realize you
embarrass yourself doing this in the eyes of just about
everybody?''
</P>
<P>
   He also reiterated that his Senate run is contingent on his
treatment for prostate cancer, which was diagnosed two weeks ago.
''I haven't made up my mind if I have the energy and the capacity
to run,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, a senior Republican official close to
Giuliani, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Associated
Press that the mayor was leaning toward quitting. ''His heart, his
soul, his body are not in this thing,'' said the official, who
added that Giuliani hadn't made a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans must choose a Senate candidate by May 30, when they
hold their state convention. State GOP chairman Bill Powers gave
Giuliani a vote of confidence Thursday, saying: ''Contrary to
everybody else's popular belief, I believe he is running.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Bruno, the Republican majority leader in the state
Senate, agreed, saying: ''There are no plans other than to support
Rudy Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, one senior adviser to state GOP leaders, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said contingency planning already was
underway in case a replacement candidate was needed.
</P>
<P>
   The list of potential replacements for Giuliani also grew
rapidly amid the mayor's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, a Long Island congressman, renewed his interest
in running, first expressed months ago. And Rep. Peter King of Long
Island and Wall Street multimillionaire Ted Forstmann, a prominent
supporter of Catholic causes, both let it be known they would be
available.
</P>
<P>
   While many were saying Giuliani's personal life was not public
information, that didn't keep them from talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton told reporters in Washington: ''Everybody in
New York and everybody in America ought to be rooting for the human
side of this to work out. We should wish him well in the struggle
of his illness, wish that family well and should want the best for
their children. And we should want some space for all of them -- out
of the glare.''
</P>
<P>
   Average New Yorkers, meanwhile, were enthralled by the daily
drama coming out of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's become a public soap opera,'' said Frank Fornario, a
Westchester teacher who said he would continue to support Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''Between the cancer and the situation with his marriage, I feel
he's not interested in the politics,'' said Kathy Andrade, a
Manhattan retiree who plans to vote for the first lady. ''Stress is
no good for him; he's better off staying home.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Edward Egan, a Catholic bishop from Connecticut who was
named head of the New York archdiocese Thursday, offered an
opinion, saying he hoped Catholics and others ''would have the
greatest sympathy for this good human being who is struggling
through two very serious situations.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush said Giuliani's family
troubles are ''a personal matter between he and his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who like other Republicans questioned President Clinton's
integrity after the impeachment scandal, was asked on Lifetime
cable if voters should be concerned about the mayor's character.
''I hope he stays in the race,'' he said. ''I'm more concerned
about the fact that he's sick.''

<HEADLINE> China Exchange Regulator Said Dead  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HUTZLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China's top foreign exchange regulator has died,
a Chinese official confirmed today, amid Hong Kong media reports
that he committed suicide either out of worries about his health or
a corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's Ming Pao newspaper reported that Li Fuxiang,
director of China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange, was
admitted to a Beijing hospital and died Wednesday after jumping
from the seventh floor.
</P>
<P>
   An official in the administration's information office said Li
had died. But the official, who would only give her surname, Deng,
refused to provide additional information, saying she was awaiting
instructions from superiors on reporting the death.
</P>
<P>
   Ming Pao and the Sing Tao Daily, another mainstream, independent
Hong Kong newspaper, said Li's death may have been related to
health, work pressure or financial problems. Sing Tao said he
suffered heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on a popular Web site said Li had checked into the No.
304 Hospital, a military facility.
</P>
<P>
   A worker in the hospital's morgue confirmed that a person
staying in the ward reserved for senior officials had fallen to his
death and the body was found outside the hospital Wednesday
morning. Police came and removed the body, said the worker, who
would not give his name.
</P>
<P>
   The internal investigation bureau of China's ruling Communist
Party recently questioned Li about corruption involving China
Everbright Bank, Sing Tao reported.
</P>
<P>
   Everbright Bank's former chairman, Zhu Xiaohua, was removed last
summer, reportedly under investigation for economic problems, an
allegation the company denied. Zhu had run the government's foreign
exchange administration for two years, leaving in 1995, three years
before Li took over.
</P>
<P>
   Li, whose age was variously reported as 47 or 48, took over the
State Administration of Foreign Exchange in October 1998. The
administration sets policies and oversees the flow of foreign
currency, an important mission in China. China's currency, the
yuan, is not fully convertible on international markets.
</P>
<P>
   Under Li's leadership, the administration tightened controls on
foreign exchange to stop illegal outflows that were pressuring
China to devalue the yuan.
</P>
<P>
   Li's death and its possible connection to the rumored but never
confirmed investigation into China Everbright could add to scandals
already embarrassing Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
   China Everbright Bank is one of China's more innovative and
profitable banks. Its parent company, China Everbright Group, which
Zhu also ran, is controlled by the State Council, the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders have been trying to curb rampant corruption that
has eroded popular support for Communist Party rule. But they have
limited the wholly state-controlled media's reporting on
corruption. They fear that revelations about the involvement of
senior officials could further damage the party's image.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation into billions of dollars of smuggling through
the southeastern port of Xiamen has implicated the wife of Beijing
party secretary Jia Qinglin, party officials have said. President
Jiang Zemin, a mentor of Jia, ordered public denials that either
Jia or his wife were involved.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Li Fuxiang's death, the spokesman's office for the
State Council said they had no information.
</P>
<P>
   Word of Li's death first appeared Thursday on a popular Internet
chat room, reported the Hong Kong-based rights group Information
Center of Human Rights and Democracy. It reported that the
two-sentence anonymous posting said Li's suicide was under
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Mining, Power Plants Big Polluters  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hard rock mining and producing electric power
are the industries responsible for the most toxic chemicals being
put into the environment, according to the latest Environmental
Protection Agency report on industrial toxic chemical releases.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's annual Toxic Release Inventory -- data from 1998 -- was
made public on Thursday and for the first time included releases
from the mining industry and from electric power plants, as well as
five other new industry sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The mining industry and power plants accounted for nearly
two-thirds of the 7.3 billion pounds of toxic chemicals put into
the environment during 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the mining industry's chemical releases occurred
in Arizona and Nevada, although the company with the single largest
amount of releases -- 405 million pounds at the Kennecott copper
mine -- was in Utah, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time in the 11-year history of the report
that mining and power plant releases had to be reported. The
expansion of reporting requirements was directed by President
Clinton in a 1997 executive order.
</P>
<P>
   With the expansion, Texas no longer was the state with the
greatest amount of toxic releases, although it continued to lead
the original group of industry sectors with 260 million pounds,
mostly from its concentration of chemical plants, and was second in
amount of releases into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Texas was surpassed in overall releases by the four leading
mining states -- Arizona, Nevada, Utah and Alaska -- and in releases
into the air by Ohio because of that state's coal-burning power
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Toxic chemical releases by industry have become an issue in the
presidential campaign with environmentalists and Vice President Al
Gore accusing Texas Gov. George W. Bush of not doing enough to
force industry to curtail toxic chemical releases.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours after the EPA data was released Thursday, the Gore
campaign pointed out that Texas continued to rank among states with
the highest volume of chemical releases, especially air releases.
''Under George W. Bush, Texas remains one of the most polluted
states in the country,'' declared a Gore campaign statement.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a Bush campaign spokesman, said that Texas also
''leads the nation in reducing toxic releases.'' He said the state
cut its toxic emissions by 43 million pounds from 1995 to 1998, or
about 14 percent. Bush campaign officials also have said that it is
only expected the state would have high releases because of its
large concentration of chemical plants.
</P>
<P>
   The toxic inventory data presents only a partial picture of
risks from toxic releases. The EPA report cautioned that the
information should be used as a guide and not necessarily an
indicator of health risk because the report does not take into
account exposure or specific toxicity of the high-volume chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   But EPA Administrator Carol Browner said the report is a
valuable ''right to know'' tool for the public to gauge potential
healthy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA said that hard rock mining companies released 3.5
billion pounds of chemicals into the air, land and water, although
all but about 1.3 million pounds was kept on the mine sites.
Electric utilities dumped more than 1.1 billion pounds, about 70
percent of it into the air through the power plant smokestacks,
mostly coal-burning plants, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers dwarfed releases by the broad section of industry
that for years have been required to make annual reports. For
example, chemical plants, the previous leader, reported 737 million
pounds of releases in 1998. In all, the original industries
released nearly 2.4 billion pounds of toxic materials.
</P>
<P>
   This year's report cannot easily be compared with previous
reports because of the addition of the seven new industry sectors.
But the EPA said among the original industry sectors, toxic
releases have declined by 45 percent over 11 years. Overall
releases also were down slightly from the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Patient Rights Bill To Be Completed  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers said they were determined to finish
a patients' rights bill, even though Democrats and Republicans
remained divided on everything from how much progress they've made
to how many Americans should be covered by the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Several congressional committee leaders met with President
Clinton on Thursday to report on the progress of negotiations to
craft legislation that would grant patients certain rights when
dealing with HMOs and other health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans insisted they have made significant progress in more
than 350 hours of negotiations over the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have spent hundreds of hours to put together a bill,'' Sen.
Don Nickles, R-Okla., chairman of a House-Senate committee writing
a compromise bill. ''We have made good progress despite what some
may think.''
</P>
<P>
   He said committee members had agreed on a crucial provision
establishing an appeals process for patients who disagree with
health plan decisions to deny coverage. Under the agreement, most
Americans in health plans could appeal to an independent panel that
would have the power to override health plan decisions if it deemed
care was medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats disputed there was an agreement, saying the Republican
appeals process would not apply to about 40 million public
employees and self-employed people. They want to extend patient
protections to all Americans in private health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Citing ''painfully slow'' progress, Democrats sought
unsuccessfully for a Memorial Day deadline to complete work on the
most contentious issues remaining: how many Americans the bill
would cover and whether patients would gain the right to sue health
plans if they are harmed when plans deny medical coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members have not yet begun to discuss those issues,
prompting Clinton to call the meeting to jump-start negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not rocket science,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would give millions the right to appeal
decisions by health maintenance organizations, offer easier access
to specialists and let people use hospitals not in their plans for
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton favors the House-passed version, which would cover 161
million Americans with private insurance and expand patients' right
to sue. The Senate passed a Republican-crafted bill that would
apply to 55 million Americans whose health plans are not regulated
by states. The Senate version does not expand the right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers pledged to finish a bill and told Clinton they would
begin meetings in the next few days to reach a compromise on
coverage and the right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans suggested that any compromise bill would have to
include expansion of medical savings accounts, tax deductions and
other GOP-backed provisions aimed at making health insurance
available to those who don't have it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We told the president we're willing to pull out all the stops
until we reach a consensus bill that gives new protections to
patients and expands access to health coverage for the uninsured,''
said Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Medical savings accounts allow people to save tax-free money to
pay doctor bills. Republicans say they help the uninsured and let
patients, rather than health plans, choose which doctors to use.
Democrats contend they are a tax shelters for the healthy and
wealthy.

<HEADLINE> Laudor found not responsible in stabbing death of fiancee  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Neither the district attorney nor the
victim's family were happy about it, but a once-successful
schizophrenic has been found not responsible for killing his
pregnant fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   Three psychiatrists, including one hired by the prosecution,
agreed in reports released Thursday that Michael Laudor killed
Caroline Costello because he thought she was ''a nonhuman
impostor'' conspiring to hospitalize him for torture,
experimentation and death.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were forced to concede that no jury would convict
Laudor of murder with the doctors' reports in evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But Costello's mother and sister, speaking in court, railed
against the idea that Laudor was not responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is horrifying for us to accept that our daughter was
murdered by someone she loved and trusted,'' said Marilyn Costello,
the victim's mother. ''Michael Laudor alone must bear the
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Laudor reddened and closed his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's sister, Joyce Costello, said, ''Regardless of
whether he is or was insane, Michael knew he had done something to
hurt Carrie and he knew enough to run. He deserves to be locked up
forever and never released, for who's to say that once released, he
won't kill somebody else?''
</P>
<P>
   Costello, 37, was found slashed to death on June 17, 1998, in
the kitchen of the apartment she shared with Laudor in
Hastings-on-Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Laudor, now 37, had won some fame for succeeding as a Yale Law
School graduate and instructor despite his schizophrenia. He had
sold book and movie rights to his story and was considered a role
model for victims who control schizophrenia through medication.
</P>
<P>
   But at some point after the death of his father in 1997, he
stopped taking his medication, apparently believing it to be part
of a conspiracy against him, prosecutor Barbara Egenhauser said.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the killing, Costello stayed home from work and
Laudor's mother and doctor arranged for a visit from a crisis
intervention team from the Westchester County Medical Center. But
that impending visit, according to one psychiatric report,
precipitated the killing because Laudor thought he would be
tortured and lobotomized.
</P>
<P>
   He called his mother and doctor, telling them ''he had killed
Carrie or a windup doll,'' Egenhauser said. They called police, who
found Costello's body and tracked Laudor to the campus of Cornell
University in Ithaca.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution, anticipating an insanity defense, hired
forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz, who Egenhauser said was ''known
for having a high threshold'' for insanity. But Dietz agreed with
the defense psychiatrists that Laudor believed his fiancee was ''a
nonperson, a robot or a doll ... planning to kill or torture him.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, saying she had no choice but to
accept the insanity plea, complained about ''a criminal justice
system that allows a psychiatrist to decide whether an individual
stands trial.'' She said psychiatric reports should be considered
only at sentencing, after ''it is decided in a courtroom who
committed a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered a new mental evaluation to help determine what
kind of treatment Laudor should now receive. Laudor told the judge
he was expecting to be returned to the Mid-Hudson Forensic
Psychiatric Center in New Hampton, where he has been treated for
some time.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules governing insanity pleas, if the state Office of
Mental Health and the court ever agreed that Laudor was no longer a
danger to himself or others, he could eventually be released.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Laudor's family issued a statement saying, ''We do
not today celebrate any legal victory, but rather mourn the loss of
Caroline Costello.''
</P>
<P>
   It said Laudor's ''arduous struggle against the cruel, heartless
and critical illness of schizophrenia continues every hour of every
day.''

	   BEIJING (AP) -- China's top foreign exchange regulator has died, a Chinese
official confirmed today, amid Hong Kong media reports that he committed suicide
either out of worries about his health or a corruption scandal. Hong Kong's Ming
Pao newspaper reported that Li Fuxiang, director of China's State Administration
of Foreign Exchange, was admitted to a Beijing hospital and died Wednesday after
jumping from the seventh floor. An official in the administration's information
office said Li had died. But the official, who would only give her surname,

Accused Scientist Challenges Govt.

	   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Defense attorneys have challenged prosecutors to

to secure a benefit, as alleged in federal charges against him. Lee, 60, a
naturalized U.S. citizen from Taiwan, was fired last year by Los Alamos National
Laboratory and accused of 59 counts of breaching lab security by transferring
files from secure to unsecure computers and to computer tapes. Lee is not
accused of espionage. But for the government to win a conviction on the most
serious charges against him, prosecutors must prove he copied weapons secrets to
portable data tapes with the intent of injuring the United States or giving a
foreign nation an advantage.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Travels To Push China Bill  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With momentum for a landmark China trade bill
seesawing in Congress, President Clinton is exerting pressure
nearly every day on undecided lawmakers, even traveling to one
congressman's district where opposition is strong.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton today was heading to Akron, Ohio, an industrial city
where union members have been trying to block efforts to extend
permanent normal trade relations with China. Akron is in the
district of Rep. Thomas Sawyer, D-Ohio, who has not yet declared
his position on the trade measure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was to meet with 15 business, religious, academic and
labor leaders to discuss their concerns about the bill. Union
members in Sawyer's district, meanwhile, were prepared to
demonstrate against the president's China policy and urge defeat of
the trade bill when a vote is taken later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Clinton was traveling to friendlier turf -- the
Hauer family farm in Shakopee, Minn., which could profit from
expanded agricultural sales to China. The rural area outside
Minneapolis is represented by Rep. David Minge, D-Minn., who is
backing the trade legislation.
</P>
<P>
   A tug-of-war over votes for and against the measure is
hard-fought in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters Thursday that he believed Majority Whip
Tom DeLay, R-Texas, would find the needed GOP votes to pass the
measure despite complaints from DeLay that Republican support was
thinner than he initially thought.
</P>
<P>
   ''I noticed that he's quite effective at getting votes when the
time comes, sometimes when I like it and sometimes when I don't,''
Clinton said of DeLay, one of the leaders of the House impeachment
effort in 1998. ''I think we'll get there. We've just got a lot of
hard work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday, Commerce Secretary William Daley, the Clinton
administration's point man on China, warned Republicans that if
they want the bill to pass, they'll have to agree to the formation
of a commission to monitor China's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a watchdog commission, which would issue an annual
report to Congress, has been suggested by Reps. Sander Levin,
D-Mich., and Doug Bereuter, R-Neb. The commission could recommend
economic sanctions against China outside of the trade area, such as
withholding U.S. loans.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer was considering the commission idea.

<HEADLINE> Army Extends No Gun Ri Probe  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army is extending a probe of civilian
killings by U.S. soldiers during the Korean War as investigators
try to untangle varying accounts of what happened in late July 1950
near the village of No Gun Ri, American officials say.
</P>
<P>
   One official said that after interviewing more than 100 people,
investigators believe ''something tragic happened'' in the South
Korean hamlet in the opening days of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   But because of discrepancies in accounts provided by U.S.
veterans and Korean survivors, investigators almost certainly will
be unable to finish the probe before the original target of June
25, the 50th anniversary of the start of the Korean conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Thursday the investigation
is likely to last until fall. ''It would be better not to
salami-slice the findings and to wait for the Army to conclude its
work and come out with everything at once,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was begun after The Associated Press, in a
report last fall, quoted U.S. veterans as saying American soldiers
killed at least 100 civilians. Korean survivors said as many as 300
civilians were shot to death under a railroad bridge at No Gun Ri
following a strafing in which about 100 died.
</P>
<P>
   Two officials, who recently discussed the matter separately on
condition of anonymity, said investigators have not verified the
scope of the alleged mass killings at the village. They also said
they have not yet established that the killings, which began on
July 26, 1950, were ordered by superior officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're quite aware that something tragic happened there,'' an
official familiar with the investigation said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that after interviews that included some of
the veterans who were at No Gun Ri and reviewing several thousand
historical documents -- Army investigators are wrestling with
''evidentiary inconsistencies.''
</P>
<P>
   One account the investigators were having trouble reconciling
was that of Edward Daily of Clarksville, Tenn., who has been
especially visible in recounting his role in the episode.
</P>
<P>
   Army spokesman Maj. Thomas Collins acknowledged that ''there are
a lot of inconsistencies that we're aware of'' in Daily's story.
Collins said Army officials contacted Daily on Wednesday to
reinterview him, but he told them he was done talking about the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The AP reported on an order issued by the 1st Cavalry Division
headquarters in late July 1950 that said: ''No refugees to cross
the front line. Fire everyone trying to cross lines. Use discretion
in case of women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   An AP request to interview Charles Cragin, the Pentagon official
directing the review, was denied Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators are still grappling with such questions as how
many people were killed, who may have issued orders to open fire,
and whether the shootings were provoked by gunfire from among the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to soldiers, the Army interviewed dozens of Korean
survivors, and sources familiar with the investigation said the
accounts were compelling.
</P>
<P>
   But the sources said investigators were having difficulty
reconstructing a consistent version from witnesses' memories of
events that occurred a half-century ago. They said there were
direct contradictions in the stories, even in conflicting accounts
given by the same person.
</P>
<P>
   The sources spoke on condition of anonymity, reflecting the
investigators' determination to avoid influencing the investigation
or triggering diplomatic problems between Washington and Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investigators met with a visiting South Korean delegation
in early May and turned over transcripts of interviews with U.S.
veterans, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins declined to comment on a report Wednesday by
Stripes.com, a privately owned Internet site for veterans, which
contended two of the dozens of Korean and U.S. witnesses who
described the No Gun Ri incident to the AP were not there at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Stripes.com report, citing a regimental document, asserted
that Delos K. Flint, an ex-GI eyewitness quoted by the AP, was
wounded and evacuated July 25, the day before the shooting started.
But a company ''morning report,'' obtained by the AP in June 1998,
says he was wounded the next day, July 26.
</P>
<P>
   The Stripes.com report also said newly released Army personnel
records indicate that Daily served in an ordnance maintenance unit
and was not in the front line unit -- H Company, 2nd Battalion of
the 7th Cavalry -- at the time of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   But Army spokesman Collins said, ''This doesn't change anything.
Ed Daily is just one guy of many that we've been talking to.''
</P>
<P>
   Five other soldiers interviewed by the AP in investigating No
Gun Ri said Daily was in H Company at the time, and he produced
documents to verify his presence in H Company then.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said investigators had questions about some of
Daily's assertions, including his presence at No Gun Ri and his
claim to have received a battlefield commission as an officer.
</P>
<P>
   Stripes.com is owned by IServed.com of Pittsburgh and publishes
the Web site and the domestic bimonthly publication under the name
The Stars and Stripes. The overseas Stars and Stripes newspaper, a
separate publication that circulates in Europe and Asia, is a U.S.
military publication.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly U.S. News and World Report magazine will publish a
story Saturday that challenges the accounts of Daily, Flint and
another veteran, Gene Hesselman. Brian Duffy, the magazine's
executive editor, said the story raised questions about whether the
three ''were in fact present at the time the incident allegedly
occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Hesselman has told the AP he was offered a medical evacuation
after being slightly wounded that day but decided to remain in the
front line instead.
</P>
<P>
   At AP headquarters in New York, spokeswoman Kelly Smith Tunney
said the AP account, which last month was awarded a Pulitzer Prize,
was based on extensive witness interviews in the United States and
South Korea and an examination of U.S. military records.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ed Daily was but one of many voices in this story and he has
repeated and vouched for the account he provided AP,'' she said.
''We're aware of discrepancies in Daily's military records and he
has shown an AP reporter documents that he says support his
contention that he served with H Company in 1950.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the Army's inquiry would not be influenced by any
news accounts of the No Gun Ri incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are conducting a comprehensive review of the facts,''
Collins said. ''As part of that review, the IG (inspector general)
is reviewing the records of many Korean War veterans, to include
Edward Daily's. It is premature to discuss our findings until the
review is complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Before publication of the AP story, South Koreans who sought
acknowledgment of the killings and compensation were told by U.S.

<HEADLINE> Fall TV Schedules Come Out Next Week  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Next week, the networks get down for the
upfronts.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Monday with NBC's presentation at the Metropolitan
Opera House, through Thursday's wingdings thrown by Fox and UPN,
each network will be touting its fall schedule for an exclusive
audience: advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   This kickoff of the ''upfront'' market (meaning: ad time for
next season now on sale!) is a special week. Indeed, it's the one
week in the TV calendar when everybody -- well, almost everybody --
is happy.
</P>
<P>
   The networks are happy because each is unveiling a lineup of
shows sure to win the hearts (and eyeballs) of the nation's
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Each show's producers and cast members are happy because they
won a place on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Once the glad tidings reach them, viewers will be happy
anticipating TV's new fall treats.
</P>
<P>
   And the advertisers will get happy at the party that follows
each presentation. There they can enjoy an open bar while
hobnobbing with the network's biggest stars.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there's a downside to the upfronts. Certain shows now
on the air -- shows that you may count among your favorites -- will
be axed to make room for newcomers. Among those series whose fate
hangs in the balance (they, in TV-speak, are ''on the bubble''),
many will soon find the bubble has burst.
</P>
<P>
   Are you a fan of ''Sports Night''? ''City of Angels''?
''Felicity''? ''Now and Again''? On the bubble, all of them.
</P>
<P>
   And what about ''Get Real''?
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if we're on the bubble. I don't know if we're
even on the radar screen,'' said Clyde Phillips, sounding
disheartened.
</P>
<P>
   If he is, it's understandable. He created Fox's splendid ''Get
Real,'' a multigenerational drama about the Green family that, in
between its frequent pre-emptions, has struggled in a cutthroat
Wednesday time slot.
</P>
<P>
   In the season finale, high school valedictorian Meghan Green
addresses her graduating class, and the message she puts forward is
even truer than Phillips intended.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to live in the moment,'' Meghan declares, ''because
our plans can change in an instant.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans changed in an instant for Phillips last month. Six weeks
into a promised eight-week,
give-the-show-a-chance-to-get-discovered run, Fox yanked ''Get
Real'' yet again, this time possibly forever. The last two
episodes, including Meghan's speech, were never aired.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're baffled,'' said Phillips. ''The message we get from Fox
is, this is a show they need, a show they want. The (ratings)
numbers haven't been what we wanted, but I think Fox'' -- with its
clumsy scheduling -- ''readily admits their part.''
</P>
<P>
   (Maybe so, but not for print. Fox had no comment on the
prospects for ''Get Real.'')
</P>
<P>
   Taking leave from Los Angeles on Martha's Vineyard, Mass.,
Phillips this week has been working on his novel as he waits for
that not-so-likely phone call granting ''Get Real'' a reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've already got stories to go next year,'' Phillips said.
''All we need is to come back and get a little traction.''
</P>
<P>
   All producer Judd Apatow needs is a new network. ''Freaks and
Geeks,'' the drama he created about youth on the fringes, was
canceled weeks ago by NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Destined to be aired just 12 times over six months, ''Freaks and
Geeks'' was an instant cause celebre among critics (who had the
luxury of preview cassettes) and viewers quick enough to catch it
when it surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   ''The show was created to be different than all the other high
school shows,'' Apatow said Wednesday from Los Angeles. ''But for
NBC, that created an immediate marketing challenge: How do you tell
people that this isn't another dumb high school show -- especially
when you're removing it from the schedule 60 percent of the time?''
</P>
<P>
   Now Apatow hopes that, in the final hours of concocting its fall
schedule, another network might salvage ''Freaks and Geeks.'' He
hopes some other network will see it as a safer bet than launching
a new series sketched out only in a pilot.
</P>
<P>
   For the upcoming season, more than 120 pilots -- each a would-be
series -- were ordered by the six broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is ''Blind Men,'' a CBS comedy about a man who sells
window treatments. There's a Fox sitcom about the mafia called
''Whacked!'' Yasmine Bleeth and Victoria Principal star in an NBC
soap set in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the 120-plus will go to series. But by next week, most
will be history.
</P>
<P>
   Judd Apatow is pretty familiar with the so-called development
process -- those frantic few months when each pilot is produced and
delivered to the network, which then renders its verdict as an
arcane accretion of ''yes'' or ''no'' cues.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, remember, Apatow became one of the lucky few who,
with ''Freaks and Geeks,'' heard his network say ''yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sort of. ''For weeks, you hear positive rumors,'' he recalled.
''Then you get more and more positive phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine, but what convinced him his series was really a go? What
does he consider the pivotal clue?
</P>
<P>
   Apatow laughed. But, of course: ''When you get the airline
ticket to New York for the upfront.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Elsewhere in television ....
</P>
<P>
   'INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS': More than 700,000 convicted felons in
the United States are serving their sentences outside of prison --
on parole. Two editions of A&AMP;E's ''Investigative Reports'' take a
look inside the process of deciding which inmates deserve early
release and who must remain behind bars. Each episode profiles
three convicts as they argue for their freedom, hoping to convince
the parole board that they are no longer a danger to society.
''Investigative Reports: Parole Board'' airs this Monday and on
Wednesday, May 24, at 9 p.m. Eastern.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is up 22 points
in today's early going. Advancing issues on the New York Stock
Exchange hold a 6-5 lead over decliners.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is ahead 42 points and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Stock Index is up four points.
</P>
<P>
   For the second day in a row, investors have gotten something of
an accommodating report on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, news of a decline in retail sales gave Wall Street
the excuse it needed for some bargain-hunting.
</P>
<P>
   And while today's report of a decline in wholesale inflation is
positive, it was also no big surprise for analysts.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the market appears to have little reason for any big
selling today. But after yesterday's gains, there may also be
little reason for any more strong gains, especially with the
Federal Reserve still expected to raise interest rates next week.

<HEADLINE> Conservation Bill Heads To Senate  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of a landmark bill to hand the
states billions of dollars for conservation are hoping the lopsided
vote by which it cleared the House will send a message to the
Senate, where it faces stiff opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, passed 315-102 Thursday after two days of
debate, would create a $45 billion, 15-year conservation fund to
buy parks and open spaces, pay for wildlife protection and restore
environmentally damaged coastal areas. The money would come from
federal revenue collected from oil and gas drilling leases -- about
$4 billion to $5 billion a year. Most of that money now goes into
the general treasury.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton in a statement called the House action ''a
historic step toward achieving permanent conservation funding'' and
urged the Senate ''to move swiftly on this legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome in the House was never really in doubt. Nearly two
dozen amendments were beaten back by wide margins as the bill's
sponsors worried that major changes in the legislation would
destroy the ''delicate balance'' of support.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans were divided, voting 118-93 for the bill,
supporters of the measure characterized the vote as an example of
bipartisanship. Among Democrats, the vote was 196-8 with two
independents splitting on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Senate is going to be hard-pressed not to pass this
legislation,'' Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, beamed to reporters after
Thursday's vote. Young had ignored opposition from property rights
groups, and along with Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., led the charge
for the bill's passage.
</P>
<P>
   That the two lawmakers would show such unity was itself a shock
to many congressional observers. Young, a vocal foe of
environmentalists, and Miller, a favorite of green groups, over the
years have clashed repeatedly over environmental legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics called the House-passed bill green pork because it
calls for distributing $3 billion a year -- at least $8.9 million
for each state -- for a broad range of conservation measures, from
buying private parcels trapped within federal land to rebuilding
eroded beaches and setting aside parts of suburbia for bike trails
and soccer fields.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska, California, Texas and Louisiana would be the big
winners, getting about a third of the $3 billion a year. No wonder,
say the critics. Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., a staunch defender of
property rights, became one of the bill's leading cheerleaders.
Louisiana stands to get $311 million a year and Alaska $163
million.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is the most ambitious environmental legislation before
the Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the single most significant commitment our nation has
ever made to investments in wildlife and wild places. The benefits
will be felt in every state for generations to come,'' Mark Van
Putten, president of the National Wildlife Federation, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But its prospects in the Senate are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the Energy and
Natural Resources Committee, said he wants to ''use the momentum of
this House success'' and plans to take up the bill next month. But
he warned that even within his committee he expected stiff
opposition from a number of senators worried about a government
rush to buy private land.
</P>
<P>
   ''There must be safeguards against unbridled government
acquisitions,'' said Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., who is on the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Young and Miller believe the strong House vote -- and support for
the legislation from the White House -- will sway senators. So will
the tens of millions of dollars annually that will go to states,
counties and towns for land purchases and other conservation
measures.
</P>
<P>
   But the property rights issue is not expected to go away.
</P>
<P>
   Young argued that the bill provides new protections against the
federal government taking land. It also will pour millions of
federal dollars into conservation easements, which can be used to
help ranchers and farmers keep their land away from developers.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the legislation is a requirement that the
36-year-old Land and Water Conservation Fund be completely spent at
$900 million a year, tripling money for federal and state land
purchases. Created in 1964, the fund was supposed to be used
exclusively for conservation, but for years has been raided by
Congress to pay for other federal programs.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Buying Sugar To Help Farmers  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government plans to buy and store 150,000
tons of surplus sugar to bail out farmers who have produced so much
of the stuff that prices have dropped 25 percent over the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department put off the decision about what to do
with the sugar, which will cost taxpayers about $60 million. The
department has considered donating it overseas or else selling it
at a steep discount for refining into ethanol, a fuel additive
normally made from corn.
</P>
<P>
   Growers have been threatening to forfeit to the government as
much as $550 million worth of sugar pledged as collateral on
federal marketing loans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are acting to help address dramatically low sugar prices,''
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said in announcing the planned
purchase late Thursday. ''By buying U.S. sugar now, we expect to
save as much as $6 million in administrative costs that the
government might otherwise incur from expected loan forfeitures
later this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of candy- and food-makers, consumer advocates and
environmental groups that opposes the sugar program had urged the
administration to let prices fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, the administration has no plan for disposing of the
sugar,'' Jeff Nedelman, a spokesman for the group, said today.
</P>
<P>
   ''They cannot dump it overseas for fear of igniting a trade war.
They cannot give it away for humanitarian aid, because no country
wants it, and they cannot refine it into ethanol without fear of
depressing corn prices. They have a crisis of their own making and
no good answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The department did not rule out buying more sugar. Farmers
expect the Clinton administration ''will take further action, as
needed, to avoid costly forfeiture of sugar under loan to the
government,'' said Ray VanDriessche, president of the American
Sugarbeet Growers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman's decision came on the eve of a visit by President
Clinton to Minnesota, a major sugar-growing state. Clinton and
Glickman were to visit a farm outside of the Minneapolis-St. Paul
area today to appeal for Congress to approve permanent trade
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   The government guarantees farmers a minimum price for domestic
sugar through the loan program and quotas on imports, but increases
in domestic production are making it difficult for USDA to control
domestic prices.
</P>
<P>
   Growers who put their sugar up as collateral for a federal loan
have the right to forfeit the crop to the government if prices fall
below the guaranteed price.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sugar program does not need Band-Aids, it needs major
surgery,'' groups opposed to the program said in a letter last
month to Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman urged sugar growers to cut back on plantings by idling
land in the government's Conservation Reserve Program, which pays
farmers to take acreage out of production.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect the sugar industry to rapidly develop conservation
and production options that can form the basis of a sustainable
sugar policy,'' Glickman said. ''Simply relying on continued
government purchases over the longer term is neither feasible nor
realistic.''

<HEADLINE> IMF Head To Visit Latin America  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Managing Director Horst Koehler of the
International Monetary Fund will visit four countries in Latin
America next week on his first overseas fact-finding trip since
taking the top job at the institution.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF said Friday that Koehler will travel to Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, on May 15; Buenos Aires, Argentina, on May 16; Tegucigalpa,
Honduras, on May 18; and Mexico City on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   ''The purpose of Mr. Koehler's trip is to hear perspectives on
critical issues facing the global economy,'' the IMF statement
said. ''He is particularly interested in the views of emerging
market countries on the role of the IMF, which will be an important
input in the consideration of reform of the institutions''
</P>
<P>
   Koehler has plans to visit Africa and Asia in coming months, the
IMF said, but no dates for those trips were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, a German and the former head of the London-based
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, assumed the top
IMF post May 2 after a bitter succession race in which the United
States publicly rejected Germany's first candidate for the job.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF and its sister lending agency, the World Bank, held
their spring meetings last month in Washington under extraordinary
security protection as demonstrators vowed to shut the sessions
down. Police arrested more than 1,300 and used pepper spray to
control crowds.

<HEADLINE> Witnesses say they tried to warn guard in fatal abduction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WESTFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- Witnesses say a Seton Hall University
security guard did nothing to help when they told him they saw a
man trying to force a woman into a car. A half-hour later,
authorities say, Christopher Honrath shot Sohayla Hope Massachi in
the back of the head with a stolen .38-caliber revolver and then
killed himself in the bedroom of his duplex apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ''She tried to start running. She's screaming, 'Help me! Help
me!''' Asia Davis, 17, told The Star-Ledger of Newark for today's
editions. Davis said the ''big man'' used a necktie to lasso
Massachi, 23, and pull her by the neck into his black Plymouth
Laser.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle lasted several minutes Wednesday afternoon on a
street in front of the South Orange campus. A second teen-age
witness screamed at Honrath to stop while Davis pleaded with a
campus security guard for help.
</P>
<P>
   The guard did not call police, which allowed Honrath, 24, to
drive off with the woman in the car, the witnesses and
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said: 'There's a woman being kidnapped out there. I have the
license plate number. She needs help.' He told me he couldn't do
anything because he's not a police officer,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the guard picked up his phone, spoke with someone and
''then he hangs up and tells me that I have to walk down to the
South Orange police station. All the way down into town. I kept
saying, 'He's out there right now! We need help!'''
</P>
<P>
   Westfield police on Thursday said the security guard's inaction
cost precious time that could have been used to prevent the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Allegedly, he told them it happened off-campus, so he would
not make the call,'' Brunelle told the Courier News of Bridgewater.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not know the identity of the guard, and university
officials said they could provide no further information.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, we can't confirm any of this,'' university
spokeswoman Laurie Pine told the Star-Ledger.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he worked for me, he'd be looking for a job at McDonald's
right now,'' Westfield police Lt. Francis Brunelle told The
Star-Ledger.
</P>
<P>
   Massachi, an education student at Seton Hall, remained on
life-support at University Hospital in Newark Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Honrath was found dead behind the bedroom door of his apartment,
near Massachi, after police went to his apartment responding to a
report of violence. Police said they heard two gunshots after
knocking on the door. The gun Honrath used had been reported stolen
in Ossining, N.Y., in 1990, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Chituru Iromuanya said they were walking home from
Columbia High School in neighboring Maplewood about 2:30 p.m. when
they passed a young woman on the sidewalk. Moments later, they saw
a man stop his car in the middle of the street, get out and go
after her, the teens said.
</P>
<P>
   The girls said after pleading with the guard they ran to
Iromuanya's house and called South Orange police, describing what
they saw and giving police the license number. An officer was sent
to the house and took their statement.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Honrath was back in Westfield and had dragged Massachi
upstairs to his bedroom, Brunelle said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had quarreled before and had obtained restraining
orders against each other, police said. Brunelle said the pair met
through the Internet a year ago.

<HEADLINE> EU Chief Not Worried by Weak Euro  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- EU Commission President Romano Prodi
said Friday he was not worried about the weakness of Europe's
single currency, adding that he was confident that the euro ''very
soon'' would be stronger than the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The euro has fallen steadily against the dollar since the
currency was launched by 11 EU countries on Jan. 4, 1999, for
corporate and investment transactions. It was trading at 90.74
cents in London on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to say that I don't care very much about that because
these ups and downs are typical of any currency market,'' Prodi
said at a news conference. ''The European Central Bank is working
well, there is no complaint about that, the fundamentals are sound,
(so are the) inflation and the rate of growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of the European Union's executive arm indicated the
euro was still suffering growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   The euro ''very soon will be bigger than the dollar,'' Prodi
said. He characterized the currency as ''a baby but a strong
baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Prodi's statement was in line with a similar statement from
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who said Thursday he too
wasn't worried about the euro and that the young currency faced the
prospect of strong growth and low inflation within the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi was in Copenhagen to attend a conference about the
15-nation bloc's upcoming intergovernmental conference on
enlargement and the need for reform when candidate countries
eventually join.
</P>
<P>
   Denmark, Sweden and Britain declined to adopt the euro in its
initial phase. Greece, which was not allowed into the monetary
union because of its high inflation and budget deficit, is expected
to gain membership next year.

   April Sees Wholesale Prices Drop
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a jump in food prices, wholesale
prices fell 0.3 percent in April after surging for two straight
months as energy costs took their biggest plunge in nine years. The
decline in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index, which
measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, was
the best showing on inflation since a 0.4 percent drop posted in
February 1999. Outside the volatile energy and food categories, the
''core'' rate of inflation at the wholesale level for the second
month in a row rose by 0.1 percent in April.

came after a series of indicators showed strength in the economy
and raised worries that the Federal Reserve would move aggressively

given the big crops that farmers are planting this spring, the
Agriculture Department said today. Soybean prices, which averaged

this year with U.S. production expected to rise 12 percent, the
department said. Prices this year will range from $4 to $5 a

planned purchase of four other Kansas City stations from Sinclair
Broadcast Group. Federal regulations require the company to divest
itself of three stations so that it will own a total of eight
stations in the Kansas City market, said Steve Fisher, a senior
vice president of Entercom.
</P>
<P>
   Once the acquisitions are completed, Entercom will own or
operate 95 stations in 18 markets, including Wilkes-Barre and
Scranton.

<HEADLINE> Economic Report Pushes Stocks Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher this morning on Wall Street
after a government report showed a decline in wholesale prices in
April, helping to quell recent worries about inflationary
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 80.28 at 10,626.25 in
mid-morning trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported this morning that wholesale prices
fell 0.3 percent in April, reversing two months of increases. It
was the best showing on inflation at the wholesale level since
February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The benign reading on inflation came after a series of
indicators showed strength in the economy and raised worries that
the Federal Reserve would move aggressively to raise borrowing
costs, beginning with the next meeting of its policy-making
committee on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 111.10 at 3,610.68, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 12.38 at 1,426.70.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a 4-to-3 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 297.97 million
shares, slighlty lower than the volume at the same time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 8.59 points to 497.98.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche's Poland Takeover Closer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- The Securities Commission has stopped its
investigation of Deutsche Bank's bid to gain control of Poland's
fifth largest bank, bringing the German giant closer to its goal, a
newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rzeczpospolita daily said the decision was made Thursday by
Poland's securities regulators.
</P>
<P>
   It described the decision as a success for Deutsche Bank, which
is taking steps to control BIG Bank Gdanski SA and strengthen its
position in Poland, a leading trading partner for Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Liliana Jarczuk, spokeswoman for the commission, confirmed it
gathered all necessary documents on the takeover but decided to
halt all proceedings for ''formal and legal reasons.'' She refused
further explanation saying the case is ''difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank refused to comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank unleashed a storm of controversy in January when
it unexpectedly pushed for the replacement of BIG's nine-member
supervisory board with a 19-member board that supported the German
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The old management and other investors protested, prompting the
Securities Commission to investigate Deutsche Bank's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Deutsche Bank increased its stake in BIG Bank to 16
percent with the purchase of 3 percent of BIG shares from an ally
in its takeover plans.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank has since asked Polish regulators for permission
to increase its control of BIG to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   BIG lacks a majority owner, and its shares are divided among
several Western and Polish financial institutions. It has been
struggling to remain independent in a sector that now is about 60
percent controlled by foreign capital.

<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- Serial killer Michael Ross received six
death sentences today, six years after his original death penalty
was overturned by the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas P. Miano ordered the execution be held Sept. 15,
although all death sentences are automatically stayed pending
Supreme Court appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will have closure when you are gone and you know longer have
the breath of life that you took from my daughter,'' said Ellen
Roode, whose 14-year-old daughter, April Brunais, was one of four
teen-age girls Ross was convicted of kidnapping and killing in
eastern Connecticut the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Ross sometimes cried as he apologized to the families of his
victims. He said any apology is inadequate but ''an absence of an
apology would be even more unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentence was handed down according to the verdict of a
Superior Court jury, which last month found that Ross should not be
spared the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Miano rejected a last-minute appeal by the defense that claimed
last week's Supreme Court decision in another death row appeal had
bearing on the case. The high court overturned Terry Johnson's
death sentence, ruling that the jury erred in finding that the
Griswold man killed state Trooper Russell Bagshaw in a cruel and
heinous manner.
</P>
<P>
   Ross admitted preying on his victims as they walked or
hitchhiked down quiet country roads in New London County. He raped
some of them.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were Robin Stavinsky, 19, of Norwich; Wendy
Baribeault, 17, of Jewett City; and two 14-year-old friends,
Brunais and Leslie Shelley, both of Griswold.
</P>
<P>
   In his defense, Ross claimed a disorder called sexual sadism
drove him to rape and kill -- a defense the jury last month
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, 40, was convicted of the slayings and sentenced to death
in 1987, but the state Supreme Court in 1994 overturned the
penalty. The high court ruled that information was withheld from
the defense that might have helped Ross get life in prison and
ordered a new penalty hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview from death row at Northern Correctional
Institution in Somers last month, Ross said he does not want his
lawyers to file any non-mandatory appeals. But he appeared to
change his mind while addressing the court today.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said that he is sickened at the thought that a higher court
could overturn the sentence and prolong the case, but has
authorized his lawyers to do what they must to complete the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers raised numerous issues at Ross' monthlong
penalty trial that may be used in an appeal. Miano and the lawyers
were forging new law for death penalty cases, since Ross was the
first person in Connecticut to have one penalty hearing for four
murders.
</P>
<P>
   Public defenders who are representing Ross also want to use his
case to highlight alleged racial inequalities in the death penalty
system. Ross is white and his victims were white, but lawyers think
Ross' case is part of a pattern where all death penalty victims are
white.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' case already has taken several roller-coaster rides
through the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Ross and prosecutors reached a written agreement to
waive appeals and put Ross to death. The Supreme Court refused to
answer questions about the legality of the deal and Miano later
rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of a new penalty hearing last summer, the case ended
up before the high court again over ground rules for the
prosecution and the defense in the hearing.

<HEADLINE> Clinton in Ohio To Push China Bill  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- A dozen protesters against a landmark China
trade bill greeted President Clinton with signs reading ''no blank
checks for China'' as he arrived here today to push Congress to
extend permanent normal trade relations to the Asian nation.
Business leaders, on the other hand, embrace the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Akron is a stronghold of union opposition, yet manufacturing
companies, such as Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co., the area's largest
employer, are enthusiastic about prospects for expanded trade with
the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   On a two-state swing through the Midwest to drum up grass-roots
support for the legislation, Clinton said passage of the bill would
ease China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, tear down
barriers to trade and investment with America and lead to more
stable relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they get is membership in the club. What they give us is
membership dues. That's the way you have to look at this,'' Clinton
told business and labor leaders at a round-table discussion that
was closed to reporters. ''The access, on purely economic terms,
is, I think, quite impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went to Ohio, a leader in machinery exports, at the
invitation of Rep. Thomas Sawyer, D-Ohio, who has not yet publicly
declared his position on the measure.
</P>
<P>
   One of the protesters outside the National Guard Armory was Don
Bingman. ''I've been a letter carrier for 32 years and I've seen
what free trade has done to the tire industry in Akron,'' said
Bingman, a member of Local 148 of the National Association of
Letter Carriers. ''I decided it was time for me as an individual to
take a stand.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the original four tire companies in Akron now make tires
there. Goodyear has factories in China.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Clinton was traveling to friendlier turf -- the
Hauer family farm in Shakopee, Minn., which could profit from
expanded agricultural sales to China. The farm, 18 miles southwest
of Minneapolis, is in a growing area where farms are becoming
subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's farm community is backing passage of the trade deal,
says Rep. David Minge, D-Minn., who represents the congressional
district where the farm is located.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the near future, 75 percent of agricultural market growth
will be in Asia. China accounts for half of that growth,'' Minge
said in a letter urging his constituents to back the measure.
''Europe, Australia and New Zealand will gladly fill that market if
our farmers are not allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   A tug of war over votes on the measure is being hard-fought in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Commerce Secretary William Daley, the Clinton
administration's point man on China, told Republicans that if they
want the bill to pass, they'll have to agree to the formation of a
commission to monitor China's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a watchdog commission, which would issue an annual
report to Congress, has been suggested by Reps. Sander Levin,
D-Mich., and Doug Bereuter, R-Neb. The commission could recommend
economic sanctions against China outside of the trade area, such as
withholding U.S. loans.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer was considering the commission idea.

<HEADLINE> Gulf War Battle Report Disputed  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE CASS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey says an Army
investigation just after the Gulf War refutes recently revived
allegations that his troops violated a cease-fire and killed Iraqi
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Newly released documents show that in 1991 the Army's criminal
investigators interviewed dozens of soldiers and officers, reviewed
maps and logs, and didn't find evidence to substantiate allegations
of wrongdoing under McCaffrey's command of the 24th Infantry
Division.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, now the White House director of drug control, has
waged a pre-emptive strike against an upcoming New Yorker magazine
article by Seymour Hersh, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who
has done new research on the charges.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey complained to the New Yorker and writers and editors
elsewhere that Hersh is spreading false allegations and engaging in
''journalistic stalking.'' Hersh responded that he was simply
''asking questions, listening to answers and trying to verify and
assess what I've been told.''
</P>
<P>
   New Yorker spokeswoman Perri Dorset said today there would be no
comment from the magazine before the story was published, and Hersh
didn't return a message seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the dispute are events the Army Criminal
Investigation Command probed in August and September of 1991, in
response to an anonymous letter alleging war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of pages of Army records released to The Associated
Press under the Freedom of Information Act provide new details
about the fiery attack on a division of Iraq's elite Republican
Guard on March 2, 1991 -- two days after President Bush declared a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the engagement occurred after the cease-fire, this
inquiry has substantiated that the engagement was clearly provoked
by the Iraqis,'' said a Sept. 9, 1991, memo from the Criminal
Investigation Command. The fight ''was within the cease-fire rules
of engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investigative documents were withheld by the Army, citing
privacy concerns, and some were missing from files. Among records
released are interviews with soldiers and officers, whose names
were blocked out, describing what became known as the ''Battle at
Rumaylah.''
</P>
<P>
   A battalion of the 24th Infantry Division was surprised in the
early morning darkness of March 2 by the appearance of a convoy of
several hundred vehicles, including tanks, artillery, rocket
launchers and trucks. The Iraqis apparently were leaving Kuwait and
looking for a way to cross U.S. lines to the safety of home.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers of the 24th Division reported taking fire from an Iraqi
tank and a missile and saw other weapons among the convoy pointed
toward them. As a result, commanders ordered the Americans to open
fire.
</P>
<P>
   One officer at McCaffrey's command post told investigators that
while the attack was under way, ''I thought it was a slaughter. But
the bottom line was he (McCaffrey) was doing what was necessary to
protect the force because they had been fired on and nobody knew
what these guys were liable to do.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, who flew to the front lines to lead the attack, later
told a Senate panel that his forces destroyed at least 630 vehicles
and pieces of equipment. He didn't estimate the number of Iraqi
soldiers killed but said many fled their vehicles and escaped
unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''While it is easy after the fact to say the Iraqis were beaten
or unable to fight, our troops were under fire,'' McCaffrey wrote
to the New Yorker on Monday in response to Hersh's questions.
''This was a huge dangerous enemy force that posed a major threat
to the integrity of my main battle area.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army investigators' memo also said that ''after extensive
interviews with personnel from brigade and battalion commanders to
privates, there was no evidence'' that soldiers at Jalibah Airfield
''killed or mistreated'' prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators did find that one Iraqi prisoner was
''accidentally shot'' two days before the U.S. attack at the
airfield, and the incident was reported up the chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations surfaced in August 1991 in an anonymous letter
alleging the attack after the cease-fire was ''a war crime''
covered up by military leaders and that soldiers ''slaughtered some
prisoners after the Jaliba Airfield attack.''
</P>
<P>
   In his response, provided to the AP, McCaffrey said, ''Across
this enormous confusing battlefield, thousands of Iraqi soldiers
were treated with enormous compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, who was awarded a fourth star before retiring to
become President Clinton's drug policy adviser, points out that the
Army investigation found ''no wrongdoing'' by any 24th Infantry
Division soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh, who won the Pulitzer Prize for reporting on the My Lai
massacre in Vietnam, also wrote ''Against All Enemies,'' a book
about the Gulf War and the unexplained illnesses reported by its
veterans.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 123; Nasdaq Gains 114  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher today after the government's
report of a decline in wholesale prices in April helped quell
recent worries about inflationary pressures and higher interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 123.03 at 10,669.00 in
midday trading. The Nasdaq composite index was up 114.33 at
3,613.91.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also were higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 21.96 at 1,429.77.
</P>
<P>
   The market had nervously awaited the Labor Department's
wholesale price report, issued before trading began today. And
investors were rewarded with a 0.3 percent decline in April that
reversed two months of increases. It was the best showing on
inflation at the wholesale level since February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The benign reading on inflation came after a series of
indicators had showed strength in the economy and raised worries
that the Federal Reserve would move aggressively to raise borrowing
costs at the next meeting of its policymaking committee on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices have seesawed in recent weeks as investors
alternately fretted and relaxed about interest rates. Technology
stocks have suffered in particular amid the continuing belief that
prices were bid too high last year and early this year.
</P>
<P>
   In today's trading, tech stocks were among the biggest gainers.
Dell Computer, which released an upbeat earnings report late
Thursday, rose 5 3/16 to 49~. Cisco Systems, hurt earlier this week
by a negative article in Barron's, was up 2 5/16 at 62 9/16. Intel
was up 3 5/16 at 118~.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a 5-to-4 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 414.29 million
shares, slightly lower than the volume at the same time Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Justice OKs Waste Deal Changes  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department approved an $80 million
exchange of waste-collection and -disposal assets between Allied
Waste Industries and Superior Services Inc. after the companies
agreed to sell some assets to preserve competition.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement with the government, Superior must sell
commercial waste-collection operations and transfer stations in
Milwaukee and Mansfield, Ohio, and must abandon it purchase of
Allied's landfill in Leeper, Pa., the department announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court here to block the
original deal, the government alleged that proposal would have
resulted in higher prices for waste hauling and disposal in these
areas. Along with the lawsuit, the government filed the agreement
that would settle the lawsuit, if the court approves it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without restructuring this deal, consumers in parts of Ohio,
Wisconsin and Pennsylvania would have paid higher prices for waste
collection and disposal,'' said Assistant Attorney General Joel I.
Klein, head of the department's antitrust division. ''This
resolution ensures that the benefits of competition -- lower prices
and better service -- will be preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied and Superior are two of only three major competitors
hauling waste in Milwaukee and they are the only two significant
waste haulers in Mansfield, the government said. In addition, they
are the only two landfill operators in the Leeper area.
</P>
<P>
   These companies contract to haul trash and garbage from
residential and commercial customers to disposal sites, like
landfills, incinerators and transfer stations, which legally
dispose of the waste for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Allied, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., is the second largest waste
hauling and disposal company in the nation and had 1999 sales of $6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Superior, based in Milwaukee, had U.S. revenues of more than
$300 million in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Navy Fights Gay Sailor Over Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- A man who resigned from the U.S. Naval
Academy amid accusations of homosexuality has been ordered to repay
the government for his education, even though a Navy review panel
found he was treated unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   The academy began investigating Tommie Lee Watkins Jr. in 1997
following alleged homosexual behavior, which is banned in the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, president of his class and an aspiring Navy pilot, said
he was pressured to resign and did so because he feared homophobia
would prevent him from receiving a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn H. Becraft, assistant secretary of the Navy for
manpower, ordered Watkins in March to repay the government nearly
$67,000.
</P>
<P>
   But a report issued in November by the Navy's highest personnel
review panel, made public today by The Washington Post, said making
Watkins reimburse the government violates Pentagon policy.
</P>
<P>
   A 1994 policy says those discharged for being gay should only be
required to repay the government under certain circumstances that
require a specific written finding of homosexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no finding of any aggravated homosexual behavior,''
the Board for Correction of Naval Records said in its report, which
was made available to The Associated Press today by William Ferris,
Watkins' lawyer. ''Accordingly, the board believes that directing
recoupment was inappropriate in Watkins's case.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferris said he will file suit next month in U.S. District Court
in Baltimore, asking that the Navy be required to follow the
board's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Becraft contended that Watkins, who resigned rather than face
charges, voluntarily left the academy. Because of that, she argued,
the Pentagon policy does not apply.
</P>
<P>
   Ferris said it is absurd for the Navy to tell Watkins he will be
kicked out if he doesn't resign and then insist he pay for his
education because he agreed to leave voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   ''I assert it is because I am an African-American homosexual,''
Watkins, now 25, told the Post.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights activists say the practice of requiring reimbursement
-- either in cash or through enlisted service -- from officer
trainees who leave the academy in their junior or senior years is
especially burdensome for homosexuals, who cannot enlist under the
ban on gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a particularly insidious twist to a policy which itself
places so many burdens on people,'' said Joseph C. Steffan, who was
himself expelled from the academy shortly before his 1987
graduation for acknowledging he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 15 upperclassmen who left the Naval Academy in the
1998-99 school year, 87 percent had to reimburse the government or
enlist.
</P>

   Among midshipmen who resigned in recent years but did not have
to reimburse the government were 24 who were expelled from the
academy in 1994 for cheating.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such misconduct strikes at the heart of the honor system at
the Academy since these midshipmen were involved in lying, cheating
and stealing, all honor offenses,'' the board said.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with them, Watkins ''was treated unfairly'' the board
said.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Watkins erupted in April 1997, when a
midshipman claimed Watkins had made advances to him and other
midshipmen. A legal officer who reviewed the case said there was
not enough evidence to support several of the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Anti-abortion leader says he won't run for Senate  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Anti-abortion activist and Operation Rescue
founder Randall Terry said Friday he will not launch a U.S. Senate
candidacy even if Republican Rudolph Giuliani drops out of the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Terry's announcement came after months of saying he was
considering a Senate run because the New York City mayor as well as
rival Hillary Rodham Clinton are abortion rights supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''A protracted bankruptcy and serious personal financial and
family difficulties'' led to the decision to withdraw, Terry said.
He filed for bankruptcy after facing civil litigation from
abortion-rights groups and is separated from his wife of 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''For those reasons I've decided not to run, and I can tell you
it's the most difficult decision I've had to make,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in June, Terry said he will take a year-long
sabbatical from public life.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is convinced that Giuliani -- plagued by prostate
cancer and marital woes -- will pull out of the race. By announcing
he's not going to jump into the fray, Terry said he's offering the
state's Republican leadership an ''olive branch'' in the hope it
will look for an anti-abortion candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pro-life movement cannot stand the possibility of Clinton
being senator. But it is the conviction of a lot of pro-lifers that
Rudy Giuliani is even a greater danger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry had hinted at a possible Senate run, even as a spoiler,
for several months. He said he would have raised at least $2
million to $3 million from anti-abortion constituents alone and
gotten 5 percent to 7 percent of the votes. In a neck-and-neck
race, Terry said that percentage may be the ''margin of defeat for
Rudy Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry said he will ''leave to the power-brokers'' to decide
alternative candidates, adding that a candidate who is ''pro-life,
pro-family and somewhat conservative'' would have no trouble
raising campaign funds nationwide ''from people who want to see an
end to the Clinton era.''
</P>
<P>
   While not endorsing any specific person, Terry said U.S. Rep.
Rick Lazio of Long Island, an abortion rights supporter, would be
''unacceptable.'' He added that Rep. Peter King, also of Long
Island, is a ''viable candidate.'' Both Lazio and King have been
mentioned as possible alternative GOP candidates if Giuliani scraps
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Terry returned to New York after lobbying unsuccessfully against
legislation in Vermont that legalized same-sex civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Terry lost a bid for a Republican congressional
nomination in New York but stayed in the race as the Right to Life
Party's candidate. Democratic incumbent Maurice Hinchey was
re-elected in that race.

<HEADLINE> Two men ignore health, age to save fishermen from deadly dam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A stroke, pneumonia and a heart condition
weren't enough to keep Ronald Tougas, 75, and Gordon Trotter, 81,
from saving two fishermen in a raging, frigid river with a
reputation for death.
</P>
<P>
   Tougas of Marlboro, Mass., and Trotter were at Trotter's
northern New York home along the Schroon River Wednesday 75 miles
north of Albany, when they spotted something in the powerful
current, coming their way. At first it looked like a turtle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then all of a sudden I saw the body pop up and I knew it was a
person,'' Tougas told the Glens Falls Post-Star.
</P>
<P>
   ''They shouted, 'Please come in and get us! Please!''' recalled
Leona Trotter on Friday of Wednesday's rescue. But she knew they
couldn't jump in. She's in her 80s and legally blind, her husband
was hospitalized over the winter after what was apparently a small
stroke and pneumonia, and Tougas has a heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, Tougas saw another head and body emerge from the
turbulent current. Then a small rowboat surfaced. Tougas and
Trotter quickly cut a rope from the dock at Trotter's home, and
watched as the river rush the two anglers toward them in the water.
They were able to get the rope to one of the men and quickly drag
him to shore at Trotter's home.
</P>
<P>
   But the other fisherman was still clinging to the overturned row
boat and moving downstream.
</P>
<P>
   ''At one point, they heard him say, 'I can't hold on much
longer,''' said Warren County sheriff's Patrol Officer John Maday.
</P>
<P>
   But the rescuers persisted, following the man south as the river
carried him away, trying to fling the rope to him. Three homes
downstream, they managed to get it to him and pull him to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Police later Wednesday praised Trotter and Tougas, saying they
likely saved the life of at least the second man, Clark Talham, 36,
who wasn't a strong swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ''These guys were lucky,'' Maday said. ''I don't think they
would have made it if it wasn't for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Talham and Stephen Koblensky, 39, both of the Schroon Lake area,
didn't require medical treatment after they were fished from the
river.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature of the water was in the upper 40s, but that
wasn't the biggest danger. The powerful current at the dam claimed
more than a half-dozen lives in 20 years, three in the summer of
1992 alone. It has taken searchers days to recover bodies in the
still popular fishing spots for trout and salmon. Among the dead
since the Trotters moved retired to their riverside log cabin in
1981 are a boy, his dog he was trying to save, a father and his
son.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good thing we were down there,'' Tougas said. ''That
river is ice cold. They could hardly breathe when they got out.''
</P>
<P>
   Trotter, a retired state Thruway Authority worker, and Tougas,
who is visiting for a week at the Trotters' log cabin, happened to
be out moving lumber at the river's edge when they spotted the
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   ''The river is beautiful, but it's treacherous this time of
year,'' said Leona Trotter, who retired years ago from the
Cooperative Extension agricultural service in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Tougas tried to buy a floatation device and 100 feet of rope to
tie to a tree for anyone to use to use in rescues. But he couldn't.
The Palmer Brothers Marine Outfitters shop in Brandt Lake that he
went insisted on providing the $80 in wares to the heroes for free.

<HEADLINE> Three Tenors Together at the Met  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Three Tenors went back to being just plain
opera singers Thursday night, appearing at the Metropolitan Opera
for their first performance together in staged opera.
</P>
<P>
   Placido Domingo, Jose Carreras and Luciano Pavarotti all sounded
splendid as each starred in one act of different operas billed as a
''millennium celebration'' to benefit the Met's pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   All the tickets were sold even though prices ranged from $100 to
$25,000 for the best opera boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Pavarotti, who sang last, in Franco Zeffirelli's lavish Act 3
set for ''Turandot,'' missed a step as he approached soprano Jane
Eaglen, who was singing the title role. He was behind her so the
audience couldn't see exactly how he fell, but he quickly stood and
joined her for a duet. He continued to sing and move around,
seeming unhurt. His manager, Herbert Breslin, said Pavarotti told
him ''I'm perfectly fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two opera acts were very short. Domingo sang first, in
Act 2 of ''Andrea Chenier.'' His voice sounded elegant, ardent and
youthful singing a wonderful love duet with Daniela Dessi. Nikolai
Putilin and Kim Josephson provided fine support.
</P>
<P>
   Carreras, last heard at the Met in 1987 as Don Jose, sang the
part again on Thursday in ''Carmen,'' Act 4. He sang with subtlety
and acted with body and voice in the tragic scene pleading with
Carmen (sung by the self-possessed Lorraine Hunt Lieberson) to come
back to him. The orchestra, conducted all evening by James Levine,
was light in this act, allowing the richness in Carreras' voice to
come through without his having to push for volume.
</P>
<P>
   Gino Quilico sang the bullfighter Escamillo and Maria Benitez
was a sinuous dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Act 3 of ''Turandot'' is longer and begins with the famous tenor
aria ''Nessun dorma.'' It is one of Pavarotti's favorite arias and
he proved that he can still sing it with the warm beauty always
characteristic of his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Eaglen sang Princess Turandot with the steely force the
part requires and Patricia Racette was exemplary as the slave Liu.
She sang with more vocal color than most sopranos who sing Liu,
making the part interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Eaglen has more volume than Pavarotti but in duets he held his
own and sounded in fine vocal fettle.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Rise in Thin Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Technology and telecom stocks once again set the
pace for firmer European equity markets Friday, taking their cue
from across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   But the overall performance of European markets was subdued amid
relatively thin trade as investors held back ahead of next
Tuesday's U.S. Federal Reserve meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Stoxx Index closed 4.62 points or 1.4 percent, up
at 389.18. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx index, which tracks companies
in countries that joined the single currency, ended up 5.38 points,
or 1.3 percent, at 436.96.
</P>
<P>
   Among telecoms, London's Kingston Communications jumped 56 pence
to 688 pence, or 9 percent, while Vodafone AirTouch advanced 7.5
pence to 278 pence on an optimistic outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Among high-tech stocks, ARM Holdings gained 20 pence to 646
pence.
</P>
<P>
   Another strong performing sector was cyclical goods and
services, up 2.3 percent, as analysts reported switching into the
sector amid expectations that interest rates might peak at a lower
rate than had been feared.
</P>
<P>
   Old economy stocks were again in the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, BMW fell on talk that Rover left a
bigger-than-expected dent in the company's balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   In domestic markets, Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index closed up 9.80
points, or 0.1 percent, at 7,269.28. The Paris CAC 40 index ended
69.14 points ahead at 6,449.27, or 1.1 percent, and in London the
FTSE-100 finished 37.6 points higher at 6,283.5, or 0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea To Resume Talks on War Dead  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After months of stalemate, North Korea has
agreed to resume talks on excavating an area in North Korea where
U.S. officials believe they could unearth the remains of several
hundred Americans killed in the Korean War, a U.S. official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before the end of June we should be back to the table'' to
negotiate details of the arrangement, Robert Jones, head of the
Pentagon office in charge of POW and missing-in-action issues, said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the North Koreans want to hold the talks in Thailand
and the Pentagon is not opposed to that.
</P>
<P>
   If the talks lead to a U.S. excavation project, it would mark a
resumption of recovery operations that were halted last year when
the Defense Department balked at a North Korean demand for a new
program of American humanitarian donations, including the
construction of factories to produce children's clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The area targeted for U.S. recovery operations is near Unsan, a
site of major battles between elements of the U.S. Army's 8th
Cavalry Regiment and Chinese troops that had swept south across the
Yalu River in early November of 1950 in a surprise offensive. The
Pentagon believes more than 500 sets of remains could be recovered
in this area.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, U.S. recovery operations in North Korea have yielded
42 sets of remains. More than 8,000 servicemen are still missing
from the war -- many from the battles with Chinese troops in late
1950.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-North Korean negotiations on an arrangement for recovery
operations in 2000 broke off last December. Several weeks later,
the North Koreans notified the Pentagon that a land reclamation
project in the Unsan area had turned up human remains and personal
belongings that indicated they were American.
</P>
<P>
   Among the personal items the North Koreans said they found was
the dog tag of Charles E. Sizemore, who according to Pentagon
records was a soldier from Rush County, Ind., who went missing on
Nov. 2, 1950. At first the North Koreans claimed they had about 400
sets of remains from this site, but later they said they had only a
few but believed that a scientific excavation could locate hundreds
more.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he hopes an agreement to conduct a recovery operation
in the Unsan area could lead to similar operations later this year
in the vicinity of the Chosin Reservoir, where many Marines were
lost in late 1950 when they encountered an onslaught of Chinese
forces from across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the Pentagon also will seek North Korean agreement to
excavate in areas on the North Korean side of the Yalu River where
many prisoner-of-war camps were established and hundreds of GIs are
known to have died.
</P>
<P>
   In a related matter, Jones expressed optimism about persuading
China to cooperate more fully in U.S. research into the fate of
American servicemen held in Korean War POW camps that were run by
the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he expects to travel to Beijing this month to kick
off an oral history project in which American officials are to
interview Chinese veterans who were involved in running Korean War
POW camps. During and after the war, U.S. intelligence reports
indicated that some American prisoners of war were taken into China
from POW camps in North Korea. China has never acknowledged that
this happened.
</P>
<P>
   On a more pessimistic note, Jones said he saw no indication that
China was ready to open up its military archives to Pentagon
researchers. Nor has it provided any information on 44 American
servicemen who are missing from the war and whom the Pentagon
believes China should have information about.

<HEADLINE> 2000 Surplus May Pass $40 Billion  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fueled by yet another burst of healthy revenue
collections, this year's federal budget surplus should exceed $40
billion without counting Social Security, the Congressional Budget
Office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The new projections, which private and federal analysts
expected, nonetheless verified the government's relentless fiscal
strength. They also demonstrated that there should be plenty of
money to pay for emergency spending legislation being written for
U.S. peacekeepers in Kosovo, anti-drug efforts in Colombia and
disasters at home.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the numbers could be good news for Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, the likely Republican presidential nominee. His
campaign recently boosted its surplus estimate for this year to
about what CBO now envisions and argued that there is enough money
to pay for his planned five-year, $460 billion tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   CBO cautioned, however, that it was unclear whether there would
be a long-term surplus improvement because of economic uncertainty.
That could make it harder for Bush and his likely Democratic rival,
Vice President Al Gore, to use the new figures to claim their
competing budget proposals are affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Only last month, the budget office projected a fiscal 2000
surplus of $26 billion without Social Security and a surplus of
$179 billion counting the retirement and pension program's huge
trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   But in its analysis released Friday, CBO said it now expects the
surplus to surpass $40 billion without Social Security and exceed
$200 billion with it.
</P>
<P>
   Both would be records for a government that until 1998 had run
three consecutive decades of deficits. Fiscal 2000 ends Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stronger economic growth is likely to continue through much of
the rest of this year,'' which could push tax receipts and the
surplus even higher, CBO's report said.
</P>
<P>
   With lawmakers beginning to write spending bills for fiscal
2001, the agency cautioned that its outlook for next year remains
uncertain. Though CBO last forecast a $15 billion surplus without
Social Security for 2001, many private analysts expect that figure
to also surpass $40 billion when the estimate is updated later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Beyond 2000, however, the outlook for economic growth will
reflect a number of factors, such as tightening monetary policy,
whose effects are not yet clear,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   CBO, Congress' nonpartisan budget analyst, based its new
estimates on revenue collections in April and early May, which
traditionally is the peak period for the government's tax
collections.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to continued surprising economic strength, total tax
receipts in April were 11 percent higher than in April 1999, CBO
said. The agency said they would have been more than 15 percent
higher if not for this year's delayed April 17 tax due date, which
because of processing delays will cause some money to be counted in
May's totals.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Joins National Geographic  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two of Washington's most respected
organizations -- the Smithsonian Institution and the National
Geographic Society -- have launched their first large-scale joint
endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   The project, ''Forces of Change,'' takes a new and detailed look
at the geological, environmental and cultural forces that shape the
Earth, combining the efforts of the Smithsonian's National Museum
of Natural History and National Geographic.
</P>
<P>
   Components include a book, on sale now; a temporary exhibit of
28 large-format photographs opening at the museum June 8 and a
permanent exhibit hall at the museum currently under development.
</P>
<P>
   The two institutions stand just blocks apart in downtown
Washington and their scientists have worked together in the past,
but this was the first major project they have undertaken together
that officials could recall.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this case it was simply that we had a great book idea and
wanted to find the publisher who would do best by it,'' said museum
director Robert Fri. ''National Geographic looked like the best one
for this book and it's turned out really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Smithsonian scientists contributed to the volume, along
with a cross section of academics and other experts.
</P>
<P>
   ''For thousands of years, people believed in the balance of
nature, that nature was constant,'' commented Daniel Botkin of
George Mason University in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scientific research of the late 20th century showed, to the
contrary, that nature is always changing and has no single, perfect
condition,'' said Botkin, head of the university's Program on
Global Change, who wrote the preface to the book.
</P>
<P>
   ''Forces of Change represents the Smithsonian's commitment to
better understanding our world, the changes that have brought us to
this point and what we face at the start of the 21st century,''
added Fri.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming photo exhibit at the museum focuses on three of the
book's 14 chapters, with the permanent exhibit to include more
detail.
</P>
<P>
   Those three are photographs of landscape and geologic vistas
contrasting the effects of nature and human occupation, accompanied
by text by writer John McPhee; a section on coral reefs under the
study of museum biologist William Kiene and ''Ritual Earth,'' a
section in which Smithsonian anthropologist Michael Mason tells how
cultures around the world use ritual and art to relate to nature.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ''Forces of Change: A New View of Nature,'' also
includes essays by Smithsonian geologist Alan Cutler, Stanford
biologist Gretchen C. Daily, University of Virginia meteorologist
Michael Garstang, Harvard professor Stephen Jay Gould, Smithsonian
Indian expert George P. Horse Capture and essayist David Quammen,
among others.

<HEADLINE> Court: More time to first major challenge of death penalty  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state's highest court Friday gave
defense lawyers nearly four months more to file legal papers in the
case which represents the first major constitutional challenge to
New York's revived death penalty law.
</P>
<P>
   The revised timetable means the Court of Appeals is unlikely to
hear the appeal of Darrel Harris until at least the summer of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Brooklyn district attorney's office and the
state Capital Defender Office both asked the Court of Appeals for
more time to formulate arguments in the complex case.
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, the court said Friday it was extending from
June 19 to Oct. 17 the deadline the Capital Defender Office has to
file its defense brief in the case.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, will push back other filing deadlines in the
case. Prosecutors have until April 20, 2001, to file their brief
and the defense has until June 15, 2001, for its reply brief to the
prosecution's brief.
</P>
<P>
   It is only after digesting all of that paper that the Court of
Appeals will hear oral arguments in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The expanding time frame is emblematic of complexity of
challenges to death penalty statutes not only in New York but
elsewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   When the revived death penalty statute went into effect in New
York on Sept. 1, 1995, experts predicted that because of
constitutional challenges to the law and individual offenders'
appeals, no one would be executed for at least a decade in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Doyle, head of the Capital Defenders Office, said the
expanding time frame is necessary to cope with the ''unique''
nature of the Harris case, ''its legal complexity and the stakes
and its implications for New York's jurisprudence.'' Complicating
that is the fact there was little development of capital punishment
court rulings in New York between the mid-1960s, when the state
abandoned the death penalty, and its revival in the mid-1990s,
Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Salomon, Doyle's first deputy, told the Court of Appeals
judges on Wednesday that her office's incomplete brief in the
Harris case is 800 pages long. Doyle said the office would try to
''bring the brief in'' at fewer than 800 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The Capital Defender Office earlier filed a statement with the
Court of Appeals listing 39 issues it was likely to raise in the
Harris appeal. They included both general constitutional challenges
to the death penalty law and specific complaints about the way
Harris was indicted, tried and convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon said some of the 39 points have been dropped, but others
have been added.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was the first person sentenced to death under the capital
punishment statute George Pataki promised to enact during his
successful 1994 gubernatorial campaign against Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, a Brooklyn jury recommended execution for Harris
after finding the former state prison guard guilty of killing three
people at a Brooklyn social club.
</P>
<P>
   Since Harris became the first person on death row in New York
since 1984, four other inmates have joined him. Death row is
located at the Clinton Correctional Facility near the U.S.-Canadian
border.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the seven-member court has only interpreted parts of the
statute and not considered broader constitutional questions about
the law.

<HEADLINE> More Defective Product Penalties?  </HEADLINE>
By REBECCA SINDERBRAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton unveiled the
president's plan Friday to toughen civil and criminal penalties for
companies that fail to notify the government or consumers about
potentially dangerous products.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would upgrade willful criminal violations of
product safety laws from misdemeanors to felonies, and eliminate
the $1.65 million cap on civil penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ''With this legislation, the punishment will finally start to
fit the crime,'' said Mrs. Clinton, who called million-dollar fines
''just a drop in the bucket'' with little impact on the profit
margins of large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Although the changes would apply to most consumer products,
Friday's announcement focused on children's products.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today reported last month that at least 17 firms had been
accused of keeping quiet about dangerous children's products since
1997. CPSC Chairman Ann Brown said she had witnessed ''a continuing
trend of nonreporting.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the CPSC assessed $922,500 in fines, 10 times as much
as it did 10 years ago. So far this year, fines have totaled more
than $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   In April, toy giant Hasbro Inc. agreed to pay a $400,000 civil
penalty for failing to give consumers and the government timely
notification about a defect in an infant carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro waited until it had received 12 reports of infant carrier
handles spontaneously unlatching, causing seven skull fractures,
before informing the government of the problem and recalling the
carriers in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the recall, Hasbro continued to deny that the product
had any defects or that the company violated any law.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said Friday that about half the products that
eventually face federal recalls are not reported to the CPSC by the
companies themselves but come to light through consumer complaints,
federal investigations, emergency room records and even coroners'
certificates.
</P>
<P>
   Brown added that too often, the CPSC had been forced to rely on
its own ''detective work.''
</P>
<P>
   In one instance last year, there were more than 3,000 complaints
against and 42 children injured in a combination child safety seat
and infant carrier manufactured by Kolcraft Enterprises before the
company agreed to a recall.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago-based Kolcraft never officially reported the defect
before the government stepped in and launched an investigation,
federal regulators said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's plan also includes an enhanced reporting
network, administered by the CPSC, to more effectively bring
children's product injury information to the agency's attention.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher today after the government's
report of a decline in wholesale prices in April helped quell
recent worries about inflationary pressures and higher interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 97.32 at 10,643.29 in
afternoon trading. The Nasdaq composite index was up 91.40 at
3,590.98.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also were higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 17.89 at 1,425.70.
</P>
<P>
   The market had nervously awaited the Labor Department's
wholesale price report, issued before trading began today. And
investors were rewarded with a 0.3 percent decline in April that
reversed two months of increases. It was the best showing on
inflation at the wholesale level since February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The benign reading on inflation came after a series of
indicators had showed strength in the economy and raised worries
that the Federal Reserve would move aggressively to raise borrowing
costs at the next meeting of its policymaking committee on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices have seesawed in recent weeks as investors
alternately fretted and relaxed about interest rates. Today's
report removed a measure of nervousness from the market, but didn't
change most analysts' expectations that the Fed will raise rates by
a half-percentage point at Tuesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The results represent a fine performance on inflation,'' said
Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America. Still,
he said, ''we'll stick with the call for 50 basis points at next
week's meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, technology stocks have stumbled amid the
continuing belief that prices were bid too high last year and early
this year. Today, they were among the biggest gainers. Dell
Computer, which released an upbeat earnings report late Thursday,
rose 5\ to 49 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Cisco Systems, hurt earlier this week by a negative
article in Barron's, was up 1[ at 61]. Intel was up 2} at 118 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks were mixed after J.P. Morgan analyst Susan
Walker White lowered her price target for nearly a dozen companies
in the sector. Among the stocks she singled out: Switchboard, which
fell ] to 10}.
</P>
<P>
   But larger companies that White downgraded remained unscathed.
Yahoo! rose 4| to 129 15/16, and eBay gained 6\ to 124.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a 5-to-4 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 593.11 million
shares, compared with 637.73 million at the same time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 6.58 points to 495.97.

<HEADLINE> Pets Could Help Presidential Runs  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE PFLEGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If George W. Bush wins the election, he won't
be the only new White House occupant with a presidential pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Spot Fetcher Bush, the Texas governor's English springer
spaniel, daughter of George and Barbara Bush's famous Millie. The
younger Bush also has two cats, including six-toed Ernie.
</P>
<P>
   Should Vice President Al Gore win, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue
would be home to Daisy, a mixed breed partial to flower beds, and
Shiloh, a black Labrador retriever named for the Tennessee town,
site of a Civil War battle.
</P>
<P>
   Tough-talking Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan has a
14-year-old cat named Gipper. He ''brings out Pat's softer side,''
said campaign spokesman Neil Bernstein, who often sees the brown
cat perched on Buchanan's lap during staff meetings at the former
Republican's home.
</P>
<P>
   Kissing babies and petting puppies has often softened a
political image. President Clinton has been known to arrange Kodak
moments with the current first pets, Buddy the dog and Socks the
cat.
</P>
<P>
   This election's Democratic and Republican contenders could do
the same. After all, the pets in both families have their touching
tales.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's son Albert found Daisy during a family vacation to Center
Hill Lake in Tennessee. The family called her Inspector Turnip,
until Tipper regularly found her sleeping in the daisies and gave
her a new name.
</P>
<P>
   Daisy, a gray and white mutt, now lives at the vice president's
residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory as does Shiloh.
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes also took in a stray, Ernie, an orange and white
kitten that Spot found in a tree. The name comes from Ernest
Hemingway, the author who had a cat with six toes, like the kitten.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie and Spot, now friends, reside in Bush's Texas residence
with a short-haired black cat named India, aka Willie.
</P>
<P>
   Why Willie? ''It's Texas. Everybody has a nickname,'' said Anne
Trenolone from the governor's press office. ''The governor gives
everybody a nickname, even his cat.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, the candidates' pets have mostly stayed out of the
limelight, though Gore has been photographed running with Daisy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Millie, who dictated a book to first lady Barbara Bush,
Spot and the cats have no books in the works, Trenolone said.
</P>
<P>
   Spot, however, does have a section on the governor's Web site
that includes a reading list for kids.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush's top priority for Texas is to make sure every
kid can read by the third grade and continue to get better at
reading every year,'' Spot says on the site. ''My owner is pretty
cool!''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential pet expert Ron Elmore, an associate dean at Kansas
State University's veterinary college, thinks the candidates' pets
can be an electoral boon.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, more American households have pets than children.
''History shows that people identify with pets,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1944 campaign, Franklin D. Roosevelt reportedly
turned a destroyer around when he discovered his dog, Fala, was
left behind on an Aleutian island. Republicans howled at the
expense to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't resent such attacks and my family doesn't resent such
attacks, but Fala does,'' Roosevelt said.
</P>
<P>
   He won.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon, aiming to be vice president in 1952, successfully
defended an alleged slush fund, saying the only gift he accepted
was Checkers, his dog.
</P>
<P>
   The man's-best-friend defense worked beautifully.

<HEADLINE> Wholesale Prices Fall in April  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wholesale prices fell in April for the first
time in 14 months as energy costs took their biggest dive in nine
years, more than outweighing a sharp jump in food prices.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the good news on inflation, economists expect the
Federal Reserve will push interest rates higher next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures
before they reach consumers, dipped an expected 0.3 percent last
month after having shot up in February and March, the Labor
Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the volatile energy and food categories, the ''core''
rate of inflation in April rose for the second straight month by
just 0.1 percent, also matching many analysts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good report. When I look at it, I kind of say where's
the inflation?'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of Georgia State
University's economic forecasting project. ''Sure, you got problems
in a few spot areas but you are always going to have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors liked the report. The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 112 points and Nasdaq added 102 points in afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
   But economists weren't as sanguine. Even though Friday's report
suggested that inflation at the wholesale level was quiet last
month, it came after a series of other economic indicators showing
great strength in the economy and rising wage and inflation
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   And that has led a growing number of economists to predict that
Fed policy-makers will boost interest rates at their meeting
Tuesday by a more aggressive half-point in order to slow the
speeding economy and keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The key to whether the Fed chooses a half-point or a
quarter-point increase may well be determined by the results of
April's Consumer Price Index, economists said. That report will be
released Tuesday, the same day the Fed meets.
</P>
<P>
   ''The CPI is really where all the action,'' said John Hancock
economist William Cheney, who is expecting a half-point interest
rate boost.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank has already raised interest rates five times by
a quarter-point each since June in an effort to slow things down a
bit and prevent inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The dip in April's wholesale prices was the first decline since
February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In February and March of this year wholesale prices shot up by 1
percent. In both months, the jolts came from soaring energy prices,
which posted their biggest increases in nearly 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But in April, energy prices plunged 4.1 percent, the steepest
decrease since February 1991. Increased crude-oil production
accounted for the decline, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices -- which skyrocketed in February and March -- went
down by 11.7 percent in April, the steepest drop in nearly 11
years. Home-heating oil fell 14 percent, the largest decline since
December 1998. Prices for liquefied petroleum gas, such as propane,
fell 7.8 percent, the biggest decrease since January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, wholesale prices have been rising at an annual
rate of 5.4 percent, compared with a 3 percent gain for all of
1999. The increase in this year's wholesale prices largely came
from a pickup in energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, food prices, which rose just 0.1 percent in March
went up a sizable 1 percent in April -- the biggest jump since
January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A record 41.6 percent increase in egg prices led the way. That
surpassed the previous record 24.6 percent increase set in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for eggs for Easter was stronger than supply and pushed
prices up, Ratajczak said. Some economists also blamed the
lingering effects of higher transportation costs stemming from the
prior surge in fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drug prices also went up 0.5 percent, something
economists partly blamed on increased demand by aging Baby Boomers
and the introduction of more expensive new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Car prices rose 0.4 percent, while light truck prices fell 0.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In another report, businesses boosted their stockpiles of goods
on shelves and backlots by 0.3 percent in March, down from a 0.5
percent rise the month before.

</P>
<P>
   Mary Virginia Jones went screaming into the night after hearing
the sound of breaking glass and seeing an intruder kick in her
kitchen door Feb. 1. After reaching a neighbor's house, she
suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized. She died 27 days

   ''He put her into the hospital,'' prosecutor David Smith said.
''He put her through hell. He didn't mean to kill her. I don't mean
that. I mean he should be held responsible for his actions.''
</P>

   Deal Creates Largest Ad Company
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- In a deal that would form the world's largest
advertising company, Britain's WPP Group is buying U.S. heavyweight
Young &AMP; Rubicam for $4.7 billion in stock. It would be the ad
industry's biggest deal ever. WPP, which already owns the
U.S.-based ad companies Ogillvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide and J. Walter

   Euro Airlines Seek Online Bookings
</P>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Travel agents want to pull the plug on
a new e-commerce venture that is being set up by Europe's top
airlines in a bid to recapture customers from discount competitors
online. Even before the announcement of the venture led by
Lufthansa, British Airways and Air France, travel agents who once
had a tight grip on booking Europeans' vacations were getting
squeezed by online travel agencies. The three airlines plan to cut
out the middleman and lead eight other carriers in building a
one-stop-shopping Web site for cheap tickets, hotel packages and
car rentals.

   Wholesale Prices Fall in April
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wholesale prices fell in April for the first
time in 14 months as energy costs took their biggest dive in nine
years, more than outweighing a sharp jump in food prices. But even
with the good news on inflation, economists expect the Federal
Reserve will push interest rates higher next week. The Producer
Price Index, which measures inflation pressures before they reach
consumers, dipped 0.3 percent last month, the Labor Department
reported today. Outside the volatile energy and food categories,
the ''core'' rate of inflation in April rose for the second
straight month by 0.1 percent.

   Maine Enacts Drug Price Curbs
</P>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- Gov. Angus King has signed legislation
enabling the state to negotiate for prescription drugs at lower
prices. Under the measure the state, as a big buyer, would seek
substantial discounts from suppliers similar to those provided to
other large purchasers, then pass on those savings to consumers. If
negotiations with manufacturers fail to reduce prices
significantly, price controls could still be imposed three years
from now. A spokeswoman for the pharmaceutical industry called the
state law ''the worst piece of legislation I've ever seen.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A worldwide surplus of grain and soybeans is
likely to push prices for many commodities down again this year,
given the big crops that farmers are planting this spring, the
Agriculture Department said today. Soybean prices, which averaged
$4.65 per bushel in 1999, will decline for the fourth year in a row
this year with U.S. production expected to rise 12 percent, the
department said. Prices this year will range from $4 to $5 a
bushel, with a midpoint of $4.50, the department said. Rice and
corn prices are expected to decline as well.

<HEADLINE> Reality Bites Cannes Film Festival  </HEADLINE>
By CLAR NI CHONGHAILE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANNES, France (AP) -- Real-life janitors in a film about the
true story of workers struggling to better their lot -- it must be a
movie by Ken Loach, a.k.a. the conscience of Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   The British director and master of social criticism is no
stranger to the star-spangled frenzy of the film festival, even if
he does think dressing up in a dinner jacket makes one look like a
''bourgeois idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   He needn't worry about his credibility, though. His films always
inject a dose of gritty reality at Cannes and his latest work,
''Bread and Roses,'' is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   For his first feature film, shot in the United States, the
veteran director turned his critical eye on movie mecca Los
Angeles, but in true Loach tradition, his gaze caught the
underside.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the ''Justice for Janitors'' union campaign that began
in the United States in the late 1980s, the $5.5 million film is
about mainly Latin American immigrant cleaners battling for better
wages and working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Not only true but topical. The ''Justice for Janitors'' movement
continues. Last month, janitors in Los Angeles sealed a new
three-year contract after an aggressive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Mexican actress Pilar Padilla, who did not speak
English when she was chosen for the lead role, plays Maya, a feisty
young woman who sneaks across the U.S. border to join her sister,
Rosa, in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Maya gets a job cleaning offices with Rosa. A chance encounter
with union activist Sam, played by Adrien Brody, draws Maya into
the union struggle and exposes the difficult choices faced by
vulnerable immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the janitors in the movie are played by real janitors --
one of whom was fired before the film ended for taking too much
time off work to act.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, cleaners clad in red T-shirts invade the swish
chrome-and-glass building they usually tidy by night.
</P>
<P>
   For Scottish scriptwriter Paul Laverty, ''Bread and Roses'' is a
promise kept.
</P>
<P>
   Laverty, who worked with Loach on ''Carla's Song'' and ''My Name
is Joe,'' hooked up with people involved with the ''Justice for
Janitors'' campaign in 1994 in Los Angeles, and promised to take
their story to the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   For Loach, the film exposes a parallel world of semi-invisible
immigrants and the two-faced reception they receive.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is this particular hypocrisy in the way immigrants are
treated -- they are abused for taking jobs and tax money, but on the
other hand, they are cheap labor,'' he said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Brody marched with activists and even took a weekend course in
union organizing to fit the role of a maverick union man.
</P>
<P>
   Padilla and co-star Elpidia Carrillo, who plays Rosa, worked a
night shift with regular janitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We worked hard, with no air conditioning. People come to their
offices and it is so clean and nobody knows how it gets done,''
said Carrillo, who also starred in Oliver Stone's ''Salvador.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrillo, originally from Mexico, gives the strongest
performance, portraying the vulnerable pride, defensiveness and
sheer weariness of a woman who has been battered by life too long.
</P>
<P>
   Loach's film is not an easy ride -- not least because it shifts
between Spanish and English. Some viewers may also think the
idealism is too simplistic and didactic, although Loach takes the
edge off with his trademark humor.
</P>
<P>
   But the acting is strong. Apart from Carrillo's powerful
performance, Padilla is a vibrant Maya and Brody is engaging and
passionate as Sam.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Faces Challenge in Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHAKRA, Lebanon (AP) -- Irish peacekeeper John Mahoney, in blue
U.N. helmet and reinforced flak jacket, kept his tattooed forearm
firmly on the machine gun mounted atop his battered white armored
personnel carrier as it bounced along a winding valley road on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to get worse around here before it gets any
better,'' said Mahoney, a veteran of U.N. peacekeeping duty, as he
surveyed the steep hills and deep wadis where Israeli troops and
their allied Lebanese militia do daily battle with a disciplined
and determined band of Islamic guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, U.N. troops patrolling a
330-square-mile swath of south Lebanon have tried to keep peace in
a place where there is precious little of it to be found -- and do
what they can to keep out of the cross fire.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that task is about to become even more difficult and
complex.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, Israel is to withdraw its troops from the buffer
zone it set up 15 years ago to try to protect its northern
communities from cross-border guerrilla attacks. But rather than
calming tensions, the expected pullout may set the stage for a new
explosion of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group spearheading the
fight against Israel and its allied militia, the South Lebanon
Army, has sharply stepped up its attacks in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Upward of a dozen times a day, its fighters -- wielding mortars
or heavy machine guns or rocket-propelled grenades -- stage
hit-and-run attacks against the squat Israeli and SLA bunkers
dotting the rugged, rocky landscape. That is about double the rate
of guerrilla activity in the previous several months, said senior
U.N. adviser Timur Goksel.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah has promised it will gun for Israeli troops until the
last possible moment -- and has hinted, through its spiritual
leader, that it may not lay down its weapons even after the
pullout.
</P>
<P>
   The SLA, meanwhile, increasingly fearful and angry over what
many in its ranks see as impending abandonment by Israel, has been
returning guerrilla fire with indiscriminate shelling and gunfire
that menaces the mainly Shiite Muslim villagers and peacekeepers
alike, the U.N. forces say.
</P>
<P>
   SLA fighters ''have become very nervous -- they open up for no
reason at all, whenever they hear the slightest noise,'' said Maj.
Joe McDonagh, spokesman for the Irish battalion. As he was briefing
a group of visiting reporters, the dull thud of mortars was heard
on the hillside just opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Only 400 yards from the nearest U.N. outpost, almost over the
heads of villagers, the SLA and guerrillas were trading fire again.
Hours earlier, just outside the Irish-patrolled area, an SLA
militiaman had been killed by a guerrilla hit on his outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Such skirmishes can rapidly spiral into wider conflict. Last
week, after SLA shellfire killed two Lebanese civilians, Hezbollah
retaliated with a rocket attack on northern Israel, to which Israel
replied by blasting power installations and a highway deep inside
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the clock ticking down to the Israeli withdrawal --
which is to take place by July 7, but which Israel says could come
even sooner -- many crucial questions about the U.N. role in the
wake of the pullout remain unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. troops -- which now patrol only a small sliver of the
Israeli-occupied zone -- are expected to expand their deployment all
the way down to the Lebanon-Israel border once Israel pulls out.
Diplomatic sources say the addition of up to 2,000 troops to the
current 4,500-member U.N. force is being discussed as part of that
redeployment plan.
</P>
<P>
   But the necessary approval for an expanded force and a larger
U.N. zone has not yet been obtained from the Lebanese government,
which in turn must answer to its domineering neighbor, Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Another crucial task will be to avoid creating a power vacuum in
south Lebanon that rogue elements -- from holdout SLA men to
Palestinian guerrillas -- could rush to fill.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. force still must recruit additional troops and work out
which member nations will contribute them. But that will take time,
and in the days and hours following what could be a precipitous
Israeli pullout, delays could make the U.N. deployment far more
difficult and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   And it is the United Nations that must certify the completion of
the Israeli pullout -- not as straightforward a matter as it
appears, as Israel must meet several conditions in addition to
pulling out its troops. Those include the disbanding of the SLA and
the release of detainees from the notorious SLA-run Khiam prison
inside the Israeli-controlled zone.

<HEADLINE> Dept. Refutes Spying Allegation  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department on Friday dismissed an
FBI assertion that foreign governments were planting spies in the
building posing as reporters.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the department tightened a nine-month old rule
and informed reporters they would be stripped of their access to
the building if found by guards above the second floor without a
government escort.
</P>
<P>
   ''During working hours, you are allowed to go to the cafeteria.
But any appointments, any visits, any discussions, any time you
need to go above the second floor, you're supposed to be
escorted,'' department spokesman Richard Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   The press office, the briefing room and a room for reporters to
work are on the second floor and can be reached only by building
pass. Guards are posted at the entrances on the first floor and
patrol all areas of the building.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying Thursday before the House International Relations
Committee on security lapses, Timothy Bereznay, an FBI section
chief, said the FBI knew of spies who used press credentials to get
into and around the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''If asked, the FBI would be willing to identify to the State
Department permanent media badge holders identified as hostile
intelligence officers so that their access could be restricted or
their visits monitored,'' Bereznay said.
</P>
<P>
   And Assistant Secretary of State David Carpenter, who is in
charge of diplomatic security, said Thursday that ''if it was
within my power, I would not have any press in the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright appeared taken by surprise
by Bereznay's testimony. She said she was trying to tighten
security and that ''obviously, we don't want spies posing as
journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Albright also remarked at a news conference: ''I think we
have to be careful here not to go crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the FBI issued a statement saying ''if the FBI is in
possession of any information of that nature, we would share it
with the State Department.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Boucher flatly disputed Bereznay's assertion.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this time, we are not aware of any information that any
members of the foreign press are utilizing the media as cover for
intelligence activities at the State Department,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And ''I think I can safely say that we're not aware of any
American press that are using this as cover for intelligence
activities,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher also dismissed as without foundation a report last week
that Israel was secretly tapping telephone at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Bereznay implied that some of the foreign agents with press
credentials represented hostile powers.
</P>
<P>
   He said the FBI, in order to protect sources and sensitive
cases, does not customarily provide other agencies with lists of
intelligence officer identities.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said there are 467 Americans with
department press credentials and 56 foreign media. These include
reporters, photographers, camera operators and technicians.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher, warning them they should not venture unescorted beyond
a limited area, said there were guards posted everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're found above the second floor with a press badge and
not an escort, the badge will be taken away from you and you will
not get it back. So there's zero tolerance for this and we do have
ways of checking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded reporters traditionally have been able to move freely
about most of the building -- excluding those parts marked
off-limits -- Boucher said: ''The issue is that we can't have people
who don't have security clearances wandering this building
anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 87; Nasdaq Gains 71  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher today after the government's
report of a decline in wholesale prices in April helped quell
recent worries about inflationary pressures and higher interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was up 87.73 at 10,633.70. The Nasdaq
composite index was up 71.34 at 3,570.92.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also were higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 18.14 at 1,425.95.
</P>
<P>
   The market had nervously awaited the Labor Department's
wholesale price report, issued before trading began today.
Investors were rewarded with a 0.3 percent decline in April that
reversed two months of increases. It was the best showing on
inflation at the wholesale level since February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The benign reading on inflation came after a series of
indicators had showed strength in the economy and raised worries
that the Federal Reserve would move aggressively to raise borrowing
costs at the next meeting of its policy-making committee on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices have seesawed in recent weeks as investors
alternately fretted and relaxed about interest rates. Today's
report removed a measure of nervousness from the market, but didn't
change most analysts' expectations that the Fed will raise rates by
a half-percentage point at Tuesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The results represent a fine performance on inflation,'' said
Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America. Still,
he said, ''we'll stick with the call for 50 basis points at next
week's meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, technology stocks have stumbled amid the
continuing belief that prices were bid too high last year and early
this year. Today, they were among the biggest gainers. Dell
Computer, which released an upbeat earnings report late Thursday,
rose 5 5/16 to 50.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Cisco Systems, hurt earlier this week by a negative
article in Barron's, was up 7/16 at 60 11/16. Intel was up 1 3/16
at 116}.
</P>
<P>
   Agilent, a spinoff of Hewlett-Packard, soared 15 7/16 to 92
after a Goldman Sachs analyst said the company is a likely addition
to the S&AMP;P 500. Agilent's full split from its parent company takes
effect June 2.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks were mixed after J.P. Morgan analyst Susan
Walker White lowered her price target for nearly a dozen companies
in the sector. Among the stocks she singled out: Switchboard, which
fell ] to 10}.
</P>
<P>
   But larger companies that White downgraded remained unscathed.
Yahoo! rose 3 1/16 to 128], and eBay gained 4 23/32 to 122 15/32.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a 5-to-4 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 693.28 million
shares, compared with 756.87 million at the same time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 4.90 points to 494.29.

<HEADLINE> New Presidential Image in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- For decades, Mexican presidential campaigns
followed a time-honored ritual: A hired band struck up a tune and
trucked-in supporters cheered as the candidate roared into town in
a convoy of luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   A quick, lachrymose speech praising the poor and promising a
better future -- and then the candidate's convoy rumbled off to
another impoverished town.
</P>
<P>
   Over seven decades, the result was always the same: the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, won the election.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was amazing how dull Mexican campaigns were,'' says
political analyst Delal Baer. ''There was no lively rhetoric. They
were convoluted, stilted.
</P>
<P>
   No more.
</P>
<P>
   Political marketing -- polling firms, political advisers, the
news media -- have become key to Mexico's July 2 presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates have been accused of publishing false poll results,
using foreign advisers, receiving preferential treatment from the
news media, pitching their message to the United States and using
spin rather than substance.
</P>
<P>
   PRI candidate Francisco Labastida, a courtly, gray-haired former
governor, joined in a hip-shaking dance with other guests on a
morning talk show this week.
</P>
<P>
   In campaign rallies, Labastida often remains the distant
platform speaker. By contrast, conservative opposition candidate
Vicente Fox has mixed with the crowds, even speaking in the spicy
slang most Mexicans use in daily life but studiously avoid in
public.
</P>
<P>
   Image-building has become even more important as polls show Fox
nearly even in the polls with Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. political consultant James Carville seems to have helped
define Labastida's campaign slogan -- ''change with a course'' --
meant to overcome the corrupt image the PRI has acquired during 71
years in power.
</P>
<P>
   Carville -- who summed up President Clinton's 1992 campaign with
the phrase ''It's the economy, stupid'' -- defined Labastida's theme
as ''It's the right kind of change, stupid'' in October.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida frequently accuses Fox, of the National Action Party,
of catering to Americans. When Fox went to meet with
Mexican-Americans in the United States, Labastida accused him of
negotiating with ''his American partners'' to sell out Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida -- who employs Washington-based political consultant
Stan Greenberg for polling and focus groups -- says his own polls
are more reliable than National Action polls showing Fox ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI, meanwhile, produced some questionable polls saying that
Labastida won a recent debate -- most here saw it as a Fox victory --
and at least one state governor prodded newspapers to publish them.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has cleaned up his language, reportedly after market
research showed that Mexicans want something closer to the
formality they are accustomed to in a president.
</P>
<P>
   All the candidates rely more on television ads and sound clips
than ever before, though the independent observer group Civic
Alliance says coverage is still often slanted.
</P>
<P>
   On television, opposition candidates are often seen fielding
hostile questions while Labastida is shown in front of cheering
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt the mold is breaking.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate's wife once stood in the background at campaign
rallies, along with local politicians who hoped to ride his
coattails to victory. Now, both local politicians and some would-be
first ladies are waging their own battles.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's wife took a spin -- on her own -- through one of
Mexico City's rougher neighborhoods to talk about crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's the first wife of a candidate with her own
personality,'' said Miguel Acosta of the Mexican Human Rights
Academy.
</P>
<P>
   The four candidates from smaller parties, some of whom show no
evidence of marketing advice, seem upset by the new style.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't let yourselves be steamrolled by empty marketing,''
candidate Porfirio Munoz Ledo of the Authentic Revolution Party
told voters during a televised debate. ''This isn't a choice being
made in a supermarket.''

<HEADLINE> Study Raises Cell Phone Concerns  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Worms that were exposed to microwave radiation of the
sort
emitted by cellular phones underwent biological changes that can
disrupt the functioning of their cells, a study found.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The experiment's results do not directly address the effects of
prolonged use of cell phones on human health.
</P>
<P>
   But the study raises concerns, said the researchers, David de
Pomerai of the University of Nottingham in England and Peter
Candido of the University of British Columbia in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ''Current exposure limits to microwave equipment might need to
be reconsidered,'' they said in the study, which was released by
the journal Nature in advance of its scheduled publication in the
May 25 issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, the researchers continuously exposed nematodes, or
microscopic soil worms, to levels of microwave radiation overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The cells of the worms later showed they produced heat-shock
proteins, which can disrupt cells' functions. Organisms produce the
proteins in response to threatening conditions, such as heat. But
the researchers said the changes in the worms were not caused by
heat but by the radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Current exposure limits for cell phones assume that the
microwave radiation they emit has no harmful effects if it does not
cause heating.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a British government panel concluded there is no
evidence that cell phones are harmful. However, it recommended that
parents limit their children's use of cell phones and that the
equipment carry labels disclosing how much radiation they generate.

<HEADLINE> Jesse Ventura on Broadway?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Watch out Broadway, here comes Gov. Jesse
Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura has signed over the rights to a musical based on his
life to Pierre Cossette, a TV, music and theatrical producer whose
credits include ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'' and ''The Will Rogers
Follies.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is tentatively titled ''The Body Ventura,'' and
Cossette said he has begun to think of scenes and songs from
Ventura's colorful life as a professional wrestler and politician.
</P>
<P>
   ''You open with the damnedest tag-team match you've ever seen,''
he said. ''I can see 'Jesse For President.' ... What a production
number that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Although millions of dollars would have to be raised before a
show could be produced, Cossette said every show he has developed
has reached Broadway. Cossette would not say how much Ventura
stands to earn, except that it would be ''a very, very tiny
percentage'' of the show.

<HEADLINE> French Bank Machines Run Dry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Cash machines around France ran out of bank notes
on Friday as armored truck guards entered the fourth day of a
strike, which they have vowed to maintain until demands for better
on-the-job protection are met.
</P>
<P>
   Empty automatic teller machines caught Parisians off-guard ahead
of the weekend, when most banks are closed. By midday Friday,
officials at France's biggest banks said that cash machines were
quickly running out of francs.
</P>
<P>
   At Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale, 25 percent of the
machines were empty by Friday afternoon, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Banque Nationale de Paris said that 10 percent of its
automatic teller machines weren't working, mostly those in busy
commercial areas.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks opted to refill cash machines on their own, a job
usually reserved for the unionized security guards, using older
notes instead of the crisp bills supplied by the guards.
</P>
<P>
   The head of Brink's armored truck service had warned on Thursday
that France could face a shortage of bank notes at automatic teller
machines over the weekend if negotiations with employers broke
down. Discussions were expected to resume Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Armored truck guards across France went on strike Tuesday after
a series of attacks on security guards. They are demanding a pay
increase and asking that limits be placed on how far guards should
have to walk from their vehicles to collect money

   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Robert Fuller, star of TV westerns
''Laramie'' and ''Wagon Train,'' said he doubts those thrilling
shows of yesteryear will be coming back to prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody in power in this business knows how to make a decent

Knoxville Western Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   As proof, he pointed to the short-lived ''Magnificent Seven'' TV

</P>
<P>
   ''None of the actors could ride a horse,'' Fuller said. ''You're
not going to get a western on the air that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuller, who later starred in the 1970s medical drama
''Emergency,'' recently made a guest appearance on ''Walker, Texas

<HEADLINE> Court: IRS Right on Church Action  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service was justified in
revoking the tax-exempt status of a small New York church that
opposed President Clinton's 1992 candidacy, a federal appeals court
ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous ruling said the revocation -- history's first
stripping of a church's tax exemption for political activity --
''neither violated the Constitution nor exceeded the IRS' statutory
authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Church at Pierce Creek, in the Binghamton, N.Y.,
area, had argued that the tax agency had exceeded its authority,
violated the church's free-speech rights and engaged in selective
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ''These objections are without merit,'' a three-judge panel of
the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Federal tax law exempts churches and other charitable
organizations from taxation provided they do not engage in certain
activities, including any political campaign on behalf of or in
opposition to any candidate for public office.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for
Separation of Church and State, said the ruling ''slams the door on
mixing religion and partisan politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a staggering defeat for Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell
and others who want to convert America's churches into a partisan
political machine,'' Lynn said. ''In light of this ruling, pastors
who allow partisan politicking in the sanctuary are jeopardizing
their church's tax exemption.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Friday before Election Day in 1992 when the Church at
Pierce Creek and its pastor, Daniel J. Little, bought a full-page
advertisement in two newspapers urging voters to reject Democratic
presidential nominee Bill Clinton because of his positions on
abortion, homosexuality and the distribution of condoms in public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Christians Beware'' ad appeared in USA Today and The
Washington Times. Americans United for Separation of Church and
State subsequently filed a complaint with the federal tax agency.
</P>
<P>
   After an investigation, the IRS revoked the church's tax-exempt
status in 1995, action held in abeyance during the legal fight. A
federal judge upheld the revocation last year, and Friday's
decision agreed with his reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court's decision focused most closely on the
church's free-speech claims, but rejected them as exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ''The church asserts first, that a revocation would threaten its
existence ... that a loss of its tax-exempt status will not only
make its members reluctant to contribute the funds essential to its
survival but may obligate the church itself to pay taxes,'' Judge
James Buckley wrote for the panel.
</P>
<P>
   ''In actual fact, even this burden is overstated ... As the IRS
confirmed in oral argument, if the church does not intervene in
future political campaigns it may hold itself out as a (tax-exempt)
organization and receive all the benefits of that status,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley's opinion also noted that churches can form separate,
non-exempt entities ''for the promotion of social welfare,'' and
that those organizations can form political action committees to
participate in campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The New York church is represented by the Robertson-founded
American Center for Law and Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we are disappointed with the ... case involving the
Church at Pierce Creek, we are encouraged that this court appears
to provide a blueprint for churches to express their beliefs in a
political context,'' ACLJ chief counsel Jay Sekulow said. ''This is
an important development in the area of protecting the First
Amendment rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Sekulow said his group had not yet decided whether it will
appeal the case to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Branch Ministries vs. Rossotti, 99-5097.

<HEADLINE> King Recalls Near Fatal Accident  </HEADLINE>
By HILLEL ITALIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Weeks after his near fatal road accident,
Stephen King wondered if he would ever write again. He couldn't
bend his knee. His hip was smashed. Sitting any longer than 40
minutes was torture.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced he had reached one of those ''crossroads moments,''
the author consulted his wife, Tabitha.
</P>
<P>
   ''My wife is the person most likely to say I'm working too
hard,'' King notes in the memoir ''On Writing,'' which will come
out this fall. ''When I told her on that July morning that I
thought I'd better get back to work, I expected a lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead, she asked me where I wanted to set up.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of ''On Writing'' is about the craft itself, but near the
end King includes a brief section in which for the first time he
writes in detail about the June 1999 collision. The author was
struck by a van while walking along the shoulder of a road in his
home state of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wasn't on the road; he was on the shoulder; my shoulder,''
King writes of the van's driver, Bryan Smith. ''I had perhaps
three-quarters of a second to register this.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a break in my memory here. On the other side of it
I'm on the ground, looking at the back of the van, which is now
pulled off the road and tilted to one side.''
</P>
<P>
   The author of such horror stories as ''Carrie'' and ''The
Shining'' underwent five operations to set the broken bones in his
right leg and hip. He also sustained broken ribs, a punctured lung
and a skull laceration. In his memoir he likens the daily
''pin-care'' treatments for his leg to having it ''dipped in
kerosene and then lit on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   For King's first day of writing after the accident, his wife set
up a work station, rolled him there in his wheelchair and kissed
him on the temple. He hung in for more than an hour and a half,
covered in sweat, but with ''no inspiration'' to go with his pain.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no sense of exhilaration, no buzz -- not that day --
but there was a sense of accomplishment that was almost as good.
I'd gotten going, there was that much,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   King estimates he takes about a hundred pills daily and he still
spends two hours a day, three days a week, in rehabilitation. He
sometimes leans upon a cane, but at a recent reading in Manhattan
he strode on to the stage unaided.
</P>
<P>
   ''(A)s my leg begins to heal and my mind reaccustoms itself to
its old routine -- I feel that old buzz of happiness, that sense of
having found the right words and put them in a line,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still don't have much strength -- I can do a little less than
half of what I used to be able to do in a day -- but I've had enough
to get me to the end of this book, and for that I'm grateful.''

<HEADLINE> Uranium Samples Found in Md.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Small samples of radioactive uranium ore have
been discovered in two document boxes containing U.S. Army
intelligence records, officials of the National Archives said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, said the samples of ''native unprocessed ore''
were discovered by U.S. Army personnel after they were transferred
from a non-public secured storage area at the Archives at College
Park, Md., to an Army center at Ballston, Va. That facility deals
with the declassification of documents.
</P>
<P>
   ''The materials were immediately tested and ultimately contained
and were determined not to present a health or safety hazard to
employees,'' the Archives said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   An Army spokesman was not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Cooper, an Archives spokeswoman, said the uranium samples
involved ''tiny'' fragments of the mineral and were contained in
four envelopes inside the two boxes.
</P>
<P>
   She said no radioactivity was detected in the area in which the
documents were being processed or on the outside of the boxes. She
said no signs of radioactivity were found on the clothes of any of
the people who handled the boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''A very small amount of radiation was detected on direct
examination of (the) four envelopes containing ore samples,'' the
Archives statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Before their transfer to the Army facility at Ballston on Jan.
24, the two suspect boxes had been stored for nearly five years in
a secured area at the Archives. Officials said they were not
available to researchers.
</P>
<P>
   No radioactivity was discovered in the Archives storage area,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Archives has asked the Department of Energy to conduct a
thorough search of all classified records, the Archives statement
said. It said future shipments of newly accessioned materials will
be examined as they arrive at the Archives building.

<HEADLINE> Bus struck by object latest in series of expressway incidents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Vandals have launched objects from
overpasses to the Kensington Expressway below at least a dozen
times in the last four months, most recently Tuesday when a chunk
of concrete was dropped onto a school bus windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Driver Stacy Moss felt slivers of glass go into her left eye,
but managed to steer the bus, which was not carrying any
passengers, off to the side of the inbound expressway also known as
Route 33.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Lord was watching over me. I was very grateful I didn't
have children in the bus,'' said Moss, 25, who was on her way to
Waterfront Elementary School to pick up children.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been several such incidents on that expressway,
a main thoroughfare into Buffalo, the potentially deadly practice
is not limited to it or to the city, officials said. Three
motorists died in New York state in 1998 from thrown of falling
objects, according to the most recent statistics available from
federal highway officials. Adolescents are usually blamed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a motorist who drove to the station house with a baby
buggy imbedded in her windshield several years ago,'' James
Giammaresi, chief of staff for the Buffalo Police Department, told
The Buffalo News. ''We've had situations where bowling balls have
been hurled at cars on the Kensington Expressway.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, two young adults narrowly escaped injury when
someone threw a couch into the path of their car on the expressway.
</P>
<P>
   ''These young kids don't recognize the danger in what they are
doing; it's a game to them,'' said State Trooper Daniel Krawczyk,
who arrested three teen-agers last summer for throwing rocks from
railroad tracks onto the Thruway.
</P>
<P>
   State Police Major Michael McManus said the youths see it as
entertainment. ''They're bored and they do it for kicks but they
don't realize the possible tragic consequences,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   J. Patrick Murphy was driving when a brick or rock was dropped
on the roof of his car. He said he drove back to where the vandals
were and called police, but left after about 45 minutes. He
contacted U.S. District Judge William Skretny after learning the
judge was recently a victim of the same mischief that he
experienced several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe cameras can be installed on overpasses where this
happens, or maybe we can give these kids something to do -- get them
involved in Habitat for Humanity or sports activities,'' Murphy, an
Amherst resident, said.
</P>
<P>
   On April 18, an object was thrown at Skretny's car on the
Kensington as he drove home from work. His windshield shattered,
spraying him with glass.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really amazing the number of individuals, about two
dozen, who have expressed to me in either letters or phone calls
that they or someone they know has had similar experiences,''
Skretny said.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the overpasses have tall fences at the edge of the
sidewalks bordering the bridges, vandals climb on them and throw
objects over. Giammaresi believes the fencing should be expanded to
cover the entire overpass.
</P>
<P>
   Krawczyk said the vandals, however, need to think their action
through.
</P>
<P>
   ''If these kids who do this could put themselves in the place of
the people in the vehicle, I think that it would make a
difference,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fishermen, boaters applaud decision to replace Manasquan rescue boat </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   POINT PLEASANT BEACH, N.J. (AP) -- Bowing to pressure, the U.S.
Coast Guard has agreed to replace a heavy-weather rescue boat at
its Manasquan Inlet station, alleviating fears that stranded
boaters or shipwreck survivors could die while waiting for another
station to send one.
</P>
<P>
   A new, 47-foot motorized lifeboat described by one seaman as
''unstoppable'' will be delivered by summer's end to replace an
older 44-foot vessel that was taken away from the station last
year, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is big,'' said commercial fisherman Jim Lovgren, captain
of the 67-foot trawler Sea Dragon, which is based here. ''This is
going to save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody sitting in 44-degree water, well, you're dead before
a boat from Sandy Hook or Barnegat gets here. It's that simple,''
Lovgren said.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the Manasquan Inlet station's lone heavy-weather
rescue boat was taken away by the Coast Guard, which is in the
process of replacing its 1960s-era 44-foot boats with the
47-footers.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard later notified station officials that the boat
wouldn't be replaced; instead, the responsibility for rescues in
seas of 8 feet or more would fall to stations in Barnegat Light and
Sandy Hook -- each more than 25 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The move triggered criticism from commercial fishermen, sport
fishermen and others who said the longer response time for SOS
calls could spell disaster for victims.
</P>
<P>
   Manasquan Inlet is one of the busiest ports on the East Coast
and needs a Coast Guard station with the equipment to act quickly
in emergencies, they said.
</P>
<P>
   They enlisted U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg and New Jersey
congressmen in a bid to reverse the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''A two-hour response time could be a death sentence for a
seriously injured boater,'' U.S. Reps. Chris Smith, James Saxton,
Frank LoBiondo, Bob Franks and Frank Pallone said in a letter to
Adm. James Loy, commandant of the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard later agreed to provide the boat, as it already
has or will soon, for stations in Cape May, Atlantic City, Barnegat
Light and Sandy Hook.
</P>
<P>
   The boats, which cost $1.2 million each, are capable of
operating in 30-foot seas and 50-knot winds. If overturned in the
water, they right themselves within 8 seconds, according to Coast
Guard officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's virtually unstoppable,'' said Senior Chief Boatswain's
Mate Rob Wyco, standing near Barnegat Light's 47-footer, which was
brought here for a news conference at which the announcement was
made. ''The only limitation on it is the crew,'' he said referring
to injury or death.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg, a member of the Senate Transportation Appropriations
Subcommittee, said that persuading the Coast Guard to provide the
boat wasn't hard.
</P>
<P>
   ''They listened to reason. And I threatened to cut the
commandant's pay,'' he joked.

<HEADLINE> Conviction in AIDS Fraud Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCRANTON, Pa. (AP) -- A couple who ran a bogus AIDS clinic have
been convicted of fraudulently charging patients hundreds of
dollars for ''ozone enemas,'' claiming the treatments
''inactivated'' the virus that causes the disease.
</P>
<P>
   A jury returned guilty verdicts Thursday against Richard Harley
and his wife, Jacqueline Kube, and their company, Lazare
Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Harley, 56, was convicted of conspiracy, fraud and distributing
drugs not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. He faces up
to 64 years in prison and could be fined more than $4 million. Kube
was convicted of mail fraud and faces up to five years in prison
and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Harley's treatment used an ''ozone generator'' to pump a mixture
of ozone and oxygen into patients' rectums, charging $250 for a 30-
to 45-second daily dose, or $7,500 for 30-day treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutor Barbara Kosik Whitaker said the pair scammed
about $300,000, mostly from investors who bought stock in the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't have the opportunity to hoodwink that many AIDS
patients,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Harley, who represented himself at trial, claimed to be a true
believer in the benefits of ozone enemas and said he never intended
to defraud anyone.

<HEADLINE> Even Cheap Drugs May Not Aid Africa  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- On an AIDS-ravaged continent
where many countries spend only $5 a year per capita on health
care, a plan by pharmaceutical companies to reduce sharply the
price of AIDS drugs was greeted Friday as a sign of progress -- but
one that will have little impact on most of those infected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if the therapy drops from $15,000 a year to $1,000,
that's still way unaffordable for most of the continent,'' said Dr.
Gary Maartens, head of the department of infectious diseases at the
University of Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   Five major drug companies announced in Geneva on Thursday they
would work with governments in Africa and other poor regions to cut
the overall costs of HIV/AIDS drugs by a reported 70 to 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, few countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where 70 percent
of the world's 33.6 million HIV-infected people live, have the
resources to provide any large-scale programs to their infected
populations.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the cut in treatment cost is a big step forward, there
is still a huge gap in terms of it making a huge difference in the
lives of infected persons,'' said Chinelo Bob-Osamor, spokeswoman
for the Nigerian Health Ministry. ''Ultimately, it is still about
who can afford to pay for treatment. I'm afraid not many people
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Even South Africa, the continent's wealthiest country, will not
be able to make the ''triple treatment'' used in treating AIDS
affordable to its more than 4 million HIV-infected people, Health
Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The entire public drug budget of $300 million would buy
treatment for only a fraction of those infected, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Maartens foresees the cheaper drugs spurring more realistic
plans, such as a program using the drug AZT to prevent transmission
of HIV from pregnant women to their children. With an estimated 25
percent of South Africa's pregnant women infected with the virus,
the government has previously said it could not afford the program.
</P>
<P>
   Only relatively wealthy countries such as Nigeria, Botswana or
South Africa could even consider long-term treatment programs for
people with full-blown AIDS, Maartens said.
</P>
<P>
   For the nearly one-fifth of South Africans who have private
insurance, and others with steady incomes, the reduced prices make
those treatments plausible for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement brought a flicker of hope to one woman sorely in
need of some good news.
</P>
<P>
   Lucia, a 31-year-old resident of Soweto, was diagnosed with HIV
in 1995 after she was raped. She declined to give her last name
because the stigma attached to AIDS is so great here that she
feared her neighbors might kill her if they found out she was
infected.
</P>
<P>
   Lucia, who owns part of a janitorial company that employs
HIV-infected workers, likely would be able to afford the
reduced-cost medicines -- but at a stiff price.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be tough for me. I won't be able to buy enough food,''
she said. And that's her dilemma. ''If you are on these drugs, you
have to eat a balanced diet. You can't just take drugs without
food, they go together.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why the government must implement an anti-poverty
program that delivers food aid as well as medicine to fight off the
illnesses that attack weakened immune systems, said Nkululeko
Nxesi, director of the National Association of People Living with
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people who are HIV positive, they don't die because of
AIDS or HIV, they die because of alternative diseases that are
curable,'' he said. ''If someone has got pneumonia, and he can't
get help to treat that pneumonia, then AZT would be useless.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Sturchio, spokesman for Merck and Co., one of the
participating drug companies, admitted there were enormous
roadblocks to be confronted before major AIDS treatments can be
dispersed to most afflicted Africans. However, he was encouraged by
planned talks among the companies, international organizations and
the African countries to work to solve the problems.	   ''This isn't going to
make a dramatic difference overnight,'' he
said. ''I think things are now moving in a constructive direction
... and we should be able to make progress on those issues. But it
is going to take time because they are complex issues.''
</P>
<P>
   One issue involves the complex regime of as many as a dozen
pills that must be taken at set times daily as part of some AIDS
treatments. Health researchers fear that if the program is not
strictly followed, the disease could become resistant to the
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   For many AIDS sufferers in rural Africa, where roads could be
cut off by floods and deliveries might be weeks late, following
such a regimen might not be plausible, Sturchio said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are the kinds of things that we need to address through
this initiative,'' he said. ''We don't have all the answers yet,
but we are encouraged that at least we have a framework to discuss
these questions.''

<HEADLINE> Russians Comb Forests for Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces claimed victories Friday
against bands of Chechen militants, after suspected rebel fighters
killed 19 federal soldiers outside the breakaway republic, further
eroding Russian assertions that organized resistance has been
quashed.
</P>
<P>
   The military said its forces staged two attacks that caused
heavy rebel casualties by employing the same ambush-style tactics
used repeatedly by the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   A federal reconnaissance unit surrounded a rebel band in densely
wooded foothills near the southeastern village of Serzhen-Yurt on
Thursday, the deputy commander of the Russian force in the region
said on Russian television. About 20 rebels and two Russian
soldiers were killed in the fighting, in which soldiers sometimes
battled hand-to-hand, said Col. Gen. Mikhail Labunets.
</P>
<P>
   The military command claimed that another Russian unit attacked
a rebel base at a sheep farm near Niki-Khita, killing 21 rebels and
seizing weapons and ammunition, according to the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The casualty claims could not be confirmed. Both sides tend to
exaggerate enemy losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military, mostly poorly trained conscripts, has
relied rarely on ambushes, instead conducting frontal assaults
following heavy airstrikes and artillery barrages. The rebels,
however, are veteran guerrillas skilled at hit-and-run tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, a remote-controlled mine planted by rebels exploded
and killed a Russian journalist, Alexander Yefremov, and two police
officers. All were riding in a jeep through a Russian-controlled
region near the capital Grozny, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   Another mine exploded on a passenger bus in Dzhaglari in eastern
Chechnya, killing three civilians and wounding 19, the military
command said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian infantry on Friday scoured the forests around the site
of Thursday's rebel ambush that killed 19 soldiers in the
neighboring republic of Ingushetia, but the gunmen appeared to have
slipped away.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest of several ambushes that have killed scores of
soldiers and challenged government claims that the rebels are near
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Officials traded blame Friday for the attack, and warned that
the Chechens were preparing to expand their fight elsewhere in
Russia. The rebels made several raids outside Chechnya in a 1994-96
war, which ended with Russian troops being driven from the
breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand civilians in Ingushetia, mostly somber older
men, rallied Friday to condemn the attack and urge an end to the
Chechnya war. Tiny Ingushetia has taken in more than 200,000
refugees who have fled the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin's chief spokesman
on Chechnya, repeated earlier denials that Russia was contemplating
negotiations with Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov. ''Any contacts
with Maskhadov's people are unacceptable,'' Yastrzhembsky said in
the southern Russian city of Vladikavkaz.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has indicated in recent weeks that it is looking for
a political solution to the conflict, but demands that the rebels
surrender their weapons and release all Russian hostages as a first
step.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops re-entered the rebellious republic in September
after Chechnya-based militants seized several villages in the
neighboring Russian region of Dagestan.

<HEADLINE> Hatch Pushes Bounced Check Tactics  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Debt collectors could phone people at any time
day or night and charge them high fees if they fail to make good on
bounced checks within 30 days under a proposal by Senate Judiciary
Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, R-Utah, is pushing the measure as an amendment to
legislation that would make it harder for people to erase debts
through bankruptcy, which has raised protests from consumer
advocates, unions, women's groups and religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Hatch said Friday his proposal was designed to crack
down on consumers who abuse the protections from creditor
harassment under current law to delay paying what they owe on
checks or to not pay at all. The aide spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the
Senate Banking Committee, said the proposal would unfairly ''allow
unfettered collection activities not only against the individual
writing a counterfeit check but also against the consumer whose
checks have been forged.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, there have been many cases in which consumers
whose checks had been stolen were subjected to ''harassing
collection tactics'' in violation of the Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act, Sarbanes wrote in a letter to Sen. Patrick Leahy of
Vermont, the Judiciary Committee's senior Democrat. He said Hatch's
proposal would allow the practice to continue legally.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, first reported in Friday's editions of The
Washington Post, would exempt collectors from the debt collection
practices law when the bounced checks in question have been
outstanding for 30 days or more. The law prohibits, for example,
calling indebted consumers late at night, repeatedly dunning them
over the phone or threatening criminal prosecution without legal
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, senators working behind closed doors to draft the
bankruptcy legislation announced Thursday that their House
counterparts had agreed to add several consumer protections to the
House bill that already were in the Senate-passed version.
</P>
<P>
   Under the provisions now in both bills, credit card companies
would be required to provide a toll-free phone number for consumers
to find out how long it would take them to pay off their balances
by making only minimum monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the companies would have to tell consumers the
exact date when late fees are charged and would be prohibited from
dropping customers who regularly pay their monthly balances in
full. When low introductory ''teaser'' rates are offered to lure
new credit card customers, the companies would have to disclose
clearly when the normal, higher rates would replace the ''teaser''
rates and what the higher rates would be.
</P>
<P>
   The same requirements would apply to credit card solicitations
made through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers should be given all the facts about their bills so
they can better manage family finances and protect themselves from
getting caught in a cycle of debt,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli,
D-N.J., a co-author of the Senate bankruptcy bill with Sen. Charles
Grassley, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate bills, both passed by veto-proof margins,
apply new standards for determining whether people filing for
bankruptcy should be forced to repay their debts under a
court-approved reorganization plan instead of having them
dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators are trying to meld the two bills
into one measure to be approved by both chambers and sent to
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the legislation say an overhaul is needed to stem
abuse by people who can afford to repay their debts. They point to
the rise in personal bankruptcies of Americans in recent years,
which reached a record 1.4 million in 1998, despite the strong
economy, up more than 300 percent since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say it would hurt people who have suffered financial
misfortune as a result of losing their jobs, getting divorced or
having to pay huge medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE -- The bill numbers for the House and Senate
versions of the bankruptcy legislation are H.R.833 and S.945.

<HEADLINE> Father acquitted in shooting of daughter's boyfriend  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BATAVIA, N.Y. (AP) -- A jury on Friday acquitted a father who
said he shot in the direction of his daughter's fleeing boyfriend
to seek justice.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Murray, 55, was accused of first-degree assault in the
shooting of his daughter's boyfriend in September. The jury also
didn't convict Murray of a lesser assault charge, court officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Murray of Pavilion, 44 miles east of Buffalo, was accused of
shooting Duane Charache, now 17, once in the stomach with a
.12-gauge shotgun on Sept. 30. He said he found Charache in his
daughter's car and held him at gunpoint while he called police.
Murray was on the phone with emergency dispatchers when Charache
ran and Murray fired three shots, state police said. One slug went
through Charache's abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Murray had said he didn't know Charache and assumed he was
trying to steal the car. Charache was planning on taking the car
and running away with Murray's daughter and another girl to Canada,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Murray would have faced five-to-25 years in state prison if he
was found guilty of the first-degree assault count, said District
Attorney Lawrence Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   The jury deliberated more than eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who retired because of health problems last year after
27 years as a truck driver, testified that on that night he saw a
young man in his daughter's car. He went inside and grabbed his
shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   ''I walked up to him and told him 'Don't run. Just stand
there,''' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   He told Charache, who Murray said he never met before, to stand
on the sidewalk while he called police.
</P>
<P>
   Charache ran, Murray dropped the phone as he was talking to
police and fired three shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hollered for him to stop and then I reached the porch
railing and fired the first shot,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said Charache disappeared into brush. Murray fired again,
aiming into the air. He briefly saw Charache again, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fired my third shot,'' Murray said. ''He was out of sight. I
was leaning over the porch and it was wet and slippery and I had
sandals on and I slipped.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said he wasn't angry that Charache was trying to take the
car.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to see justice done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Benjamin Bonarigo, who spoke with jurors after
the case ended, said the jury acquitted Murray because they didn't
believe his client intended to injure Charache and that Murray
didn't show the necessary ''wanton or reckless'' disregard for the
youth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Justice has been served,'' Bonarigo said.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Giuliani Marriage Not Private  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A poll out Friday found that eight in 10 New
York voters believe Rudolph Giuliani's marital problems are a
private matter.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven percent said the issue is relevant in the Senate race
against Hillary Rodham Clinton and makes them view the mayor
negatively as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was an indication that in an already close Senate race,
voter dissatisfaction over the New York City mayor's marital
problems and concern about his health could become an important
factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't need a poll to tell you this is going to hurt him,''
said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The latest New York Daily News/New York 1 poll found 81 percent
of New York voters said Giuliani's announcement this week that he
and his wife were discussing a legal separation was a private
matter and had no effect on how they viewed him as a Senate
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the combination of factors -- his treatable
prostate cancer, the separation and his wife's claim that he had a
relationship with a City Hall employee during their marriage --
meant he should get out of the race, 63 percent said he should
continue to run. Seventeen percent said he should pack up his
campaign gear.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday if he found the results heartening, Giuliani said:
''No, this is a very highly personal matter. My focus and concern
are for all the people involved in it. I've never paid an awful lot
of attention to polls.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he had still not made up his mind about staying
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Post/Fox TV poll from the end of April, conducted by
Zogby International just after Giuliani, 55, announced he had
cancer, found 12 percent of voters said the disease meant he was no
longer a strong candidate. Eighty-two percent said he remained a
strong candidate.

<HEADLINE> New US Embassy in Moscow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The United States unveiled a new, debugged embassy
building in Moscow on Friday, 15 years after its construction was
halted because Soviet builders had left it riddled with listening
devices.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Marine squadron hoisted the American flag in front of the
red-brick building, and Ambassador James Collins called it ''one of
the most challenging construction projects ever undertaken by the
Department of State.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been a task ... beset by the unexpected,'' Collins said
in a speech.
</P>
<P>
   Work on what would have become the new U.S. Embassy was halted
in 1985 after listening devices installed by Soviet construction
workers were discovered throughout the building. American officials
concluded that the bugging was so extensive that the building could
not be used for diplomatic purposes. The structure remained empty
for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, a decision was made to tear down the top two floors
and add four new ones. The six lower stories were gutted to only
columns and floors, to be used only for non-classified operations,
embassy officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Only American workers were used in the new construction.
Thousands of people worked on the building over the years, and one
was killed in an on-the-job accident, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   One glass wall of the rebuilt chancery faces the main Russian
government building, called the White House, across a big
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   ''The move ... parallels the figurative move of U.S.-Russia
relations into a new era,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the start of a new century and the transfer of leadership
in Russia to a young, forward-looking new generation of Russian
leaders, we are witnessing the opening of new possibilities to
develop and strengthen U.S.-Russian relations,'' he said, referring
to the recent election of President Vladimir Putin.

<HEADLINE> Report: Sankoh Flees To Liberia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sierra Leone rebel leader Foday Sankoh is
believed to be in Liberia or is heading to that country, Sierra
Leone's ambassador to the United States said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh disappeared Monday after demonstrators swarmed his house
in the country's capital, Freetown. His bodyguards shot and killed
at least four of them.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever Sankoh surfaces, he should be taken to Sierra Leone to
fulfill his obligations under the peace agreement he signed last
year, Ambassador John E. Leigh told a news conference.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Fewer Women Enrolling for MBAs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Greater numbers of women are enrolling in top
law and medical schools than in graduate business programs,
apparently because many women don't see business careers as
compatible with their personal and professional goals, according to
a study released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of more than 1,600 male and female MBA graduates was
done by the New York-based women's group Catalyst along with the
University of Michigan Business School and the university's Center
for the Education of Women.
</P>
<P>
   It found that 95 percent of all graduates from 12 of the
nation's top business schools expressed satisfaction with their
school experience and post-MBA careers. Yet while women make up 44
percent of law and medical school classes, they constitute just 30
percent of those enrolled in MBA programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have an opportunity gap -- high satisfaction among women who
attend MBA programs but few women investing themselves in those
programs in the first place,'' said B. Joseph White, dean of the
University of Michigan's business school.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that one-third of women MBA graduates surveyed
felt business school culture to be too aggressive and competitive.
More than half said they could not relate to people in case studies
used in the classroom, and nearly 40 percent said there are not
enough opportunities to work with women professors.
</P>
<P>
   While equally satisfied with their jobs, men and women were on
somewhat different career tracks after graduation, the study found.
Forty-six percent of the men MBA graduates were found to be
employed in ''line jobs,'' while just 37 percent of women graduates
had such positions.
</P>
<P>
   So-called line jobs -- related to running the factories, sales
staffs and accounting -- tend to lead to positions in senior
management. Women often are routed to other jobs, such as human
resources and information systems.
</P>
<P>
   The study said that among the factors holding women back from
getting MBAs were a lack of female role models, the perceived
incompatibility of business careers with their life goals, a lack
of confidence in mathematical skills and lack of encouragement from
employers.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.4
percentage points, covered MBA graduates from Michigan, Columbia
University, Dartmouth College, Duke University, University of
California at Los Angeles, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
New York University, Stanford University, University of California
at Berkeley, University of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania and
University of Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Census Counting Door-To-Door  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly one-third of the households that failed
to return their census forms have now been counted by workers going
door-to-door, the Census Bureau reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Census Deputy Director William G. Barron, Jr., said that 30
percent of the roughly 42 million households which did not return a
form have been counted by census takers.
</P>
<P>
   The army of 460,000 workers has been in the field just under two
weeks and is expected to continue seeking out people who did not
respond for another eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Census forms were sent to most households across the country in
March with residents asked to return them around April 1.
</P>
<P>
   The mail-back response rate of 65 percent matched that of 1990,
surprising officials who had expected it to fall slightly
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before the Committee on National Statistics meeting in
Washington, Barron said the Bureau is ''very pleased with the
progress to date of the enumeration phase of the census.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-percent completion reflected results through Thursday, or
the first week and one half of the 10-week process.
</P>
<P>
   ''There remain significant challenges ahead in the next eight
weeks, but the census continues to be running very well and all
operations are meeting or exceeding our expectations,'' Barron
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-N.Y., ranking member of the House
Government Reform census subcommittee, called the report ''an
amazing accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution requires a national census every 10 years for
purposes of reapportioning seats in the House of Representatives.
The data collected are also widely used for many other purposes,
including distribution of billions of dollars in state and federal
aid to communities across the country.

<HEADLINE> Study: Gender Determined in Womb  </HEADLINE>
By SETH HETTENA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- A study of male children who were born without
penises and raised as girls found that most of them considered
themselves boys when they got older -- suggesting that gender
identity is determined in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   The results call into question the practice of surgically
''reassigning'' the sex of such infants, researchers at the Johns
Hopkins Hospital said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers tracked the development of 27 children who had been
born without a penis, a rare defect known as a cloacal exstrophy.
The infants were otherwise male with normal testicles, male genes
and hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five of the children were sex-reassigned -- doctors
castrated them at birth and their parents raised them as girls.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, all of the children, now ages 5 to 16,
exhibited the rough-and-tumble play of boys. Fourteen declared
themselves to be boys, in one case as early as age 5, said Dr.
William G. Reiner, a child and adolescent psychiatrist and
urologist at the Hopkins Children's Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''These studies indicate that with time and age, children may
well know what their gender is, regardless of any and all
information and child-rearing to the contrary,'' he said. ''They
seem to be quite capable of telling us who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The two children who were not reassigned and were raised as boys
fit in well with their normal male peers and were better adjusted
psychologically than the reassigned children, Reiner said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were presented Friday at the Lawson Wilkins
Pediatric Endocrine Society Meeting in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has very profound implications for the development of
gender identity,'' said Michael Bailey, an associate professor of
psychology at Northwestern University, who studies gender identity
and sexual orientation. ''This suggests that hormones' effect on
the brain has a major impact on gender identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiner also called for a thorough review of the practice of sex
reassignment of children.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marianne J. Legato, a professor of clinical medicine who
studies the differences between men and women at Columbia
University, said that sexual differentiation occurs in the first
trimester of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the brain has been masculinized by exposure to
testosterone, it is kind of useless to say to this individual,
'You're a girl,''' she said. ''It is this impact of testosterone
that gives males the feelings that they are men.''
</P>
<P>
   The results contradicted a Canadian study published in the
journal Pediatrics in 1998 that suggested gender identity develops
after birth. In that study, researchers found that a boy who was
raised as a girl after his penis was mutilated during circumcision
continued to live as a woman.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Protest Turns Violent  </HEADLINE>
By JAMIE TARABAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Hundreds of students hurling rocks and
bottles clashed with police Friday in the streets of Jakarta,
demanding that former president Suharto be tried for alleged
corruption during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   Police fired round after round of tear gas outside Suharto's
house at protesters chanting ''Hang Suharto! Hang Suharto!'' Dozens
of students set fire to tires in the street and threw stones at
police, who fired more tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Put Suharto on trial now!'' read one poster carried by
protester. Others in the crowd carried pictures of the former
leader with the eyes punched out.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, demonstrators smashed windows at a police station and
threw Molotov cocktails inside. At least six people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The protest came on the second anniversary of the killing of
four students by police in the waning days of Suharto's
authoritarian regime.
</P>
<P>
   The former president, who is now 79, has been charged with
corruption but not yet tried. He has refused to be questioned by
prosecutors, saying he is too ill.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, about 1,000 college students protested outside
parliament demanding Suharto be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial was unveiled in front of Trisakti University honoring
the four students who died there two years ago. Funded by teachers,
students and relatives of the victims, it shows four 32-foot steel
pillars with holes near the top symbolizing the gunshots that
killed them. Four large wreaths were placed beneath them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really feel the loss of our four colleagues. ... We will
continue the struggle for them and the fight for democratic
reforms,'' said Raja Tobing, president of the student union at
Trisakti.
</P>
<P>
   A massive swell of student-led protests and riots culminated in
the downfall of Suharto on May 21, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the introduction of some democratic reforms by Suharto's
replacement, B.J. Habibie, and their continuation by President
Abdurrahman Wahid, elected in October, many students believe more
are needed. They especially want a greater effort by the government
to prosecute Suharto for the millions of dollars that he and his
family allegedly plundered from government funds and programs.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen police were arrested after the Trisakti shootings. Four
have been convicted and sentenced to terms of less than a year in
jail for disobeying orders.

<HEADLINE> GOP Panel Urges Primary Plan  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The smallest states would vote first and the
biggest would wait till last in the next Republican presidential
primaries under a plan endorsed by state GOP leaders Friday over
the objections of the large states.
</P>
<P>
   The state leaders postponed a decision on whether to exempt Iowa
and New Hampshire from the plan and allow them to retain their
first-in-the-nation status. That question will be left for this
summer's Republican National Convention, which also will consider
the small-states-first primary plan.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger states will have more clout at the Philadelphia
convention.
</P>
<P>
   The subject gained urgency this year after both parties' winners
were decided by early March, before half the states had held
primaries or caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the large states' leaders warned that the change
could lead to a floor fight at the convention and distract from the
hoped-for show of solidarity behind the presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want the headlines to be about how we are going to
elect a president in 2004, I want them to be about electing this
president,'' said Susan Weddington of Texas, a member of the
party's rules committee.
</P>
<P>
   Committee member Robert Bennett of Ohio added, ''Realistically,
this is a big-state-versus-everyone-else battle, and we feel we are
getting the short end of the stick,''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett did win approval for setting up a subcommittee including
both opponents and proponents to try to adjust the proposal so it
will win the endorsement of more states.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
said the proposal would make the primary process more meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the GOP is blessed with a great candidate in George W.
Bush, that is more credit to his ability than the front-loaded,
media-driven ... campaign process that disenfranchises so many
states and so many voters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have decided to stay with their current system for
now, allowing Iowa and New Hampshire to go first and restricting
other states to a window from the first Tuesday in March to the
second Tuesday in June.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new GOP plan, the smallest states would vote no
earlier than the first Tuesday in February, with three more
clusters voting in subsequent months, ending in May. Large states
won approval for moving the timeframe, originally March-June, up by
one month.
</P>
<P>
   Voting last would be the largest states, including California,
Texas and New York, with 47 percent of the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The rules committee voted 36-13 for the plan after debate over
two days. Each state and territory had one vote and most of the
largest states opposed the plan, saying it would negate their
strategic importance.
</P>
<P>
   But former Sen. Bill Brock of Tennessee, who led an advisory
group that recommended the plan, said, ''We really have put a new
emphasis on what we call retail politics, small states, grass-roots
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock he was not bothered by warnings of a convention battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''First of all I think fights are great. They give a lot of
energy to the convention, otherwise it's a bunch of boring
speeches,'' he said with a smile. But he also said the plan could
be improved to the point where almost all states would support it.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents suggested the Democrats would gain a tactical
advantage by settling on their nominee before the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot tie our hands while theirs may be able to choke
us,'' Ohio's Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Morton Blackwell of Virginia responded, ''We shouldn't condition
nomination of our delegates on anything the Democrats do.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Rath, a rules committee member from New Hampshire, made
the motion to postpone consideration of an exemption for his state
and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged the exemption might have been rejected and said,
''This group is tired, and to put them through exhausting debate on
another issue, I don't think this was the right time.''

<HEADLINE> UN Observers Make Harrowing Escape  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Day after day, night after night,
the U.N. peacekeepers hunkered down in their compound endured the
harassing gunfire and the taunts of rebels who came to their camp
gate wearing U.N. uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''I skinned the guy who was wearing this,'' one called to the
men holed up inside. ''You are next.''
</P>
<P>
   The three British military observers and one New Zealander
wondered what they should do. Unlike the armed Kenyan U.N.
peacekeepers holding off the rebels, they had no guns.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, the rebels were holding hostage hundreds of U.N.
peacekeepers from Zambia -- their weapons, uniforms and vehicles
seized -- and clashes were breaking out. The fragile cease-fire in
this west African country was nearing collapse.
</P>
<P>
   They decided to make a break for it.
</P>
<P>
   With only a new moon to light their way, the four jumped,
unarmed, over the compound wall after midnight on May 5 and escaped
through the back alleys of Makeni, the town in central Sierra Leone
where they had lived for four months.
</P>
<P>
   ''Going over the wall, it was like the feeling when you are
standing on top of the high diving board. The difference being, you
are not sure if there is any water underneath,'' said Maj. Phil
Ashby, 30, a lean, good-natured British Royal Marine who was among
the four.
</P>
<P>
   It was three days and 50 miles later before he felt safe again.
</P>
<P>
   Several times, the four -- dressed in camouflage fatigues --
nearly bumped into patrols of the rebel Revolutionary United Front,
who control Makeni.
</P>
<P>
   Did the rebels see them? They still don't know. Ashby wonders if
the rebels saw them and, assuming they were armed, let them pass
by.
</P>
<P>
   They slipped out of Makeni, 80 miles northeast of Freetown, and
moved into the bush, crossing dense jungle, rice paddies and scrub.
</P>
<P>
   They froze at the slightest sign of life; a glowing cigarette
tip, the dying embers of a fire.
</P>
<P>
   When dawn broke, the men hid motionless underneath the brush. As
the sun rose, and temperatures soared, sleep was impossible. The
heat was enveloping, the humidity choking.
</P>
<P>
   ''I spent most of the day trying to decide where the sun was
going next and where I could get a bit of shade,'' said Maj. Andrew
Samsonoff, 26, of the British Light Infantry.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby had a portable radio and listened to his favorite team
lose a soccer game back in Britain. The others whispered jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to remind myself this was real,'' said Samsonoff.
''There is a big temptation to slip into 'this is just an exercise.
The people out there aren't really going to kill us.'''
</P>
<P>
   At nightfall, they resumed their painstaking trek.
</P>
<P>
   But already, they were dangerously dehydrated and weak. They
hadn't slept for four days before their escape because of rebel
gunfire. Ashby had been ill with malaria until two days before they
left, Samsonoff was still recovering from typhoid.
</P>
<P>
   And they'd been able to take few supplies -- just a little bit of
food and two pints of water each.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, worn out by lack of sleep and water, began hallucinating.
At first it was funny, but as his hallucinations worsened, the men
rested. Ashby improved.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby said he was ''pretty scared'' during the ordeal, but
added: ''You worry about being tired more than about being
scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashby and Samsonoff had survival training, but the others, Lt.
Comdr. Paul Rowland, 31, of the British Royal Navy and Maj. David
Lingard, 37, of the New Zealand Army, did not.
</P>
<P>
   ''The worst moment was when two of the guys collapsed from heat
exhaustion and couldn't move without leaning on the two of us,''
said Ashby, still pale from the exhaustion of his journey and
covered in scratches.
</P>
<P>
   Making slow progress traveling at night, they finally approached
a farmer who found them a guide.
</P>
<P>
   With the guide scouting ahead for rebels, they began traveling
by day, finally reaching a village controlled by a pro-government
militia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reception we got was as if the Queen of England herself
had walked in,'' Samsonoff said. ''They sat us down, took our boots
off, gave us flip-flops, cooked us a meal.''
</P>
<P>
   The four slept that night in the village's best hut. In the
morning, a man was sent on the village's only bicycle to get help,
and a chicken was slaughtered for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Five hours later, a U.N. chopper landed in the village, lifting
the four to safety in Freetown, the capital, now heavily fortified
against a feared rebel assault.
</P>
<P>
   While the men won't say where they were picked up -- they don't
want to give the rebels clues about who helped them -- they crossed
more than 50 miles on foot by the time the helicopter touched down,
three days after they left Makeni.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're cleaned up, fed and back at base. They've got new
camouflage uniforms, replacing their shredded fatigues.
</P>
<P>
   They're grateful to the Sierra Leoneans who helped them out,
especially their guide.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we had been caught, we may have become hostages again,''
said Ashby. The guide would have been shot on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   All four refused a U.N. offer to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Said Ashby: ''If anybody has valuable information about what's
going on upcountry, it's us.''

<HEADLINE> Justice: SBC Addressed Concerns  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- SBC Communications has made progress in
addressing certain competitive concerns as it seeks to offer
long-distance service in Texas, the Justice Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although not lending a full endorsement, the Justice Department
said that SBC had improved its performance in one of four areas
identified by the department as problematic several months ago. It
also said it would review the other three issues and defer its
judgment on those matters until more data became available later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   The department makes its recommendations to the Federal
Communications Commission, which ultimately decides whether to
allow Bell companies to provide their local customers with
long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 law mandated that before a Bell company can do so, it
first must show in detail that it has opened its local monopoly to
give rivals a chance to compete. So far, Bell Atlantic has been the
only company to meet the test in New York.
</P>
<P>
   SBC filed its initial application in the beginning of this year
seeking to offer long-distance in Texas. But the bid received harsh
reviews from the Justice Department, which said that the company
had not taken sufficient steps to give competing companies access
to its network -- as required by law -- and recommended that the FCC
deny the petition.
</P>
<P>
   The company ultimately asked for a new review, so it could
bolster its application with more information.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Justice Department said the company had
adequately addressed one important hurdle -- making sure its rivals
can get needed equipment to connect their local calls to SBC's
networks.
</P>
<P>
   But the department said it would push off its evaluation of
other matters until it could get more data. Those issues include
the company's handling of requests from rival businesses seeking to
lease lines so they could offer high-speed Internet service and its
processing of orders to switch local phone customers over to
competing providers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are encouraged that the Department of Justice will continue
to review the entire record and we look forward to working with
them to address any remaining issues,'' said Priscilla Hill-Ardoin,
SBC's vice president for federal regulatory affairs.
</P>
<P>
   SBC filed its new application on April 5. The FCC has 90 days to
render a decision and must also take into account the evaluation of
state regulators. In this case, the Texas Public Utility Commission
has given its endorsement twice.

<HEADLINE> Intentional Brush Burning Defended  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When officials set a brush fire at Bandelier
National Monument last week, the plan was to have a small fire
prevent a big one. But the wrong weather patterns can turn such
prescribed fires into just the kind of monster infernos they're
meant to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   As the New Mexico wildfire set by the National Park Service
continued blazing uncontrolled Friday, Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman imposed a 30-day
moratorium on prescribed fires in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal government's controlled burn policy is out of
control,'' said Rep. Joe Skeen, R-N.M., who like many critics
favors logging to thin out overgrown forests.
</P>
<P>
   ''The National Park Service is acting like children playing with
matches,'' said Rep. Helen Chenoweth-Hage, R-Idaho, chairwoman of
the House Resources Committee's forests panel. She said her
subcommittee would hold a hearing into the decision to conduct the
burn.
</P>
<P>
   Prescribed fire experts say the blazes can be an important tool
to prevent catastrophic forest fires by clearing away the dead logs
and underbrush that fuel the big fires. That fuel has built up in
federal forests because for more than a century, natural fires were
snuffed out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can conduct a thousand prescribed burns and the public will
never know about it. We lose one, and we get all the press, and
that's unfortunate,'' said John Fort, director of the National
Interagency Prescribed Fire Training Center in Tallahassee, Fla.
''The people in the business who are very experienced never get any
credit. They're trying to do the right thing by the environment and
the public and the weather gets them every now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service, for example, says it has set 3,746
prescribed fires since 1968, of which 38 have gotten out of control
including two that are still burning: the fire at Bandelier that
has burned more than 200 homes in Los Alamos and part of the nearby
nuclear laboratory and one that has burned more than 7,000 acres on
the North Rim of the Grand Canyon in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations require extensive planning before setting
fires. Officials must map out where they want the fire to burn, the
weather ideal for the planned fire and contingency plans in case it
gets out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Many New Mexico officials and residents have criticized the Park
Service for setting the fire when it was warm and dry.
</P>
<P>
   However, Fort said such conditions don't automatically rule out
a prescribed fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some goals and objectives dictate hot and dry conditions, and
you can do a controlled fire very well in those conditions,'' said
Fort, a 28-year veteran of prescribed fires for three federal
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But Rob Mitchell, director of the Fire Ecology Center at Texas
Tech University, said prescribed fires when it is hot, dry and
windy are a bad idea. He said he would not set a fire if the
humidity were less than 20 percent, the temperature more than 80
degrees, winds were gusting higher than 20 mph or a cold front were
moving in.
</P>
<P>
   The humidity was less than 20 percent when the New Mexico fire
was set; winds were forecast to be about 10 mph and the high
temperature that day was in the 70s. Winds picked up hours after
the fire was set, pushing the blaze out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm worried that prescribed burning is going to get a black
eye, and we don't need that,'' Mitchell said. ''There are millions
of acres in the U.S. that need prescribed burns. It's a dangerous
proposition, but it's an environmentally friendly tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are investigating the decision to set the New
Mexico fire, and have placed the Bandelier superintendent who
approved the decision, Roy Weaver, on suspension with pay. Babbitt
has already pledged to try to compensate Los Alamos homeowners.

<HEADLINE> Dow Rises 63; Nasdaq Gains 29  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Friday after the government's report
of a decline in wholesale prices in April helped quell recent
worries about rising interest rates. But investors took profits in
late afternoon, proving that a single positive report wasn't enough
to eliminate all their fears.
</P>
<P>
   Selling in the last hour of trading left the Dow Jones
industrial average up 63.40 at 10,609.37. The Nasdaq composite
index rose 29.48 to 3,529.06. Earlier in the session, each index
was up as much as 120 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow ended the week with a gain of 31.51 points, while heavy
selling on Monday and Wednesday left the Nasdaq down 287.75 points
for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mostly higher Friday. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 rose 13.15 to 1,420.96 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 1.55 to 490.94.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks initially shot higher Friday after the Labor Department's
Producer Price Index showed a 0.3 percent decline in April that
reversed two months of increases. It was the best showing on
inflation at the wholesale level since February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The benign report came after a series of indicators had showed
strength in the economy and raised worries that the Federal Reserve
would move aggressively to raise borrowing costs at the next
meeting of its policy-making committee on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices have seesawed in recent weeks as investors
alternately fretted and relaxed about interest rates. Friday's
report removed a measure of nervousness from the market, but didn't
change most analysts' expectations that the Fed will raise rates by
a half-percentage point at Tuesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The results represent a fine performance on inflation,'' said
Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America. Still,
he said, ''we'll stick with the call for 50 basis points (half a
percentage point) at next week's meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Many investors shared Moran's view and opted to stay out of the
market until the Fed's meeting has passed. Those who were willing
to put money to work remained cautious, taking some profits from
sharp gains on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some skepticism in the market going into the Fed's
meeting,'' said Richard A. Dickson, a technical analyst at Scott &AMP;
Stringfellow in Richmond, Va. ''That's taken some of the glow off
the attempts to rally.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, technology stocks have stumbled amid the
continuing belief that prices were bid too high last year and early
this year. Investors are beginning to nibble at stocks that have
been knocked down to more reasonable prices, Dickson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate to use the word 'bargain' in reference to technology
stocks, but there is some bargain-hunting going on there,'' he
said. Dell Computer, which released an upbeat earnings report late
Thursday, rose 5 3/16 to 49~. Sun Microsystems rose 4 11/16 to 81{.
</P>
<P>
   Agilent, a spinoff of Hewlett-Packard, soared 13 3/16 to 89}
after a Goldman Sachs analyst said the company is a likely addition
to the S&AMP;P 500. Agilent's full split from its parent company takes
effect June 2.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks were mixed after J.P. Morgan analyst Susan
Walker White lowered her price target for nearly a dozen companies
in the sector. Among the stocks she singled out: Switchboard, which
fell 1 to 10[.
</P>
<P>
   But larger companies that White downgraded remained unscathed.
Online auctioneer eBay closed up 3 9/16 to 121 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 853.87 million
shares, compared with 947.41 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.8 percent, coming
back from a steep selloff of 4.6 percent the day before.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Germany's Xetra DAX index edged up 0.1 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 1.1
percent.

<HEADLINE> Jackson To Visit Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After weeks of telephone negotiations with
leaders of warring factions in bloodstained Sierra Leone, civil
rights activist Jesse Jackson will visit the West African region
Tuesday in an attempt to free captured U.N. peacekeepers there.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, in Pittsburgh to address a group of communications
lawyers, said he hopes that face-to-face meetings and a moral
appeal could help to end the bloodshed between government forces
under President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and rebel forces of the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF).
</P>
<P>
   Through telephone calls with regional leaders, Jackson said,
''We have done a lot of the work needed to bring together crucial
forces to end the fighting. We want to help facilitate the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Details on the mission are sketchy. Calling the situation ''very
fluid,'' Jackson said he expects to land in neighboring Liberia,
which has been working to help broker a peace settlement. Where
Jackson will go from there isn't certain but could include a visit
to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   But while his itinerary is uncertain, Jackson's goal is solid --
get freedom for the 500 U.N. peacekeepers now in rebel hands.
</P>
<P>
   ''The peacekeepers must not be used as bargaining chips. Their
role is too significant to be captured and used that way,'' Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Civil war has raged in the diamond-rich nation for eight years.
Last year, a peace agreement was signed granting RUF forces, under
the leadership of Foday Sankoh, a stake in the national government
in exchange for laying down their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But the RUF continued to stockpile arms and then escalated the
fighting, moving toward the capital of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh hasn't been seen in several days and Jackson appealed to
the rebel leader to resurface and help bring stability to the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would tell Sankoh to make himself become visible and make an
appeal to release the U.N. peacekeepers. It would be of immense
value to Sierra Leone, the Congo and the rest of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Sankoh missing, it has added to the tension,'' Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some like Amnesty International USA Director William F. Schulz
have called on President Clinton to state unequivocally that those
who commit atrocities in Sierra Leone will be prosecuted for war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he wasn't willing to commit to a war crimes panel
at this stage, saying he wanted to avoid statements that could sow
''fear or divisiveness''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he wasn't sure exactly why the peace negotiations
broke down but guessed ''greed and the politics of diamonds.''

<HEADLINE> Controversy in Calif. Gender Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A bill banning job and housing
discrimination based on a person's perceived gender was approved by
state lawmakers over the opposition of those who argued it could
force businesses to allow cross-dressers at work.
</P>
<P>
   California law already prohibits discrimination based on sex and
sexual orientation. The bill would add a person's appearance or
behavior, whether or not those traits differ from what is
''traditionally associated'' with his or her gender.
</P>
<P>
   The author, Assemblyman Fred Keeley, said there were court cases
in other states where heterosexuals were fired or lost promotions
because they were not feminine or masculine enough. He said the
bill would prevent similar situations in California.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said businesses feared the bill would result in
lawsuits filed if bosses did not allow cross-dressing men to wear
dresses at work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we're going to be telling businesses they can't set some
dress-code standards of how they want their employees to look,''
said Assemblyman Steve Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   Keeley said the bill would not change current law, which allows
employers to impose dress codes if there is a legitimate business
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The state Assembly approved the measure 41-30 Thursday, and it
now goes to the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Euro  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the euro Friday as
European leaders seemed willing to intervene in an effort to revive
their ailing currency. The dollar rose slightly against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 91.89 cents, up
from 90.06 cents late Wednesday. The dollar was quoted at 108.89
Japanese yen, up from 108.53 yen.
</P>
<P>
   The euro surged in value against the dollar during a late rally
after several European leaders indicated a desire to develop a
strategy for curbing the euro's recent decline.
</P>
<P>
   No specifics were provided, however, leaving analysts to
question whether Friday's gains were a turning point or merely a
temporary lift.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market here is somewhat confused,'' said Hillel Waxman,
chief foreign exchange trader for Bank Leumi USA, referring to
sentiment among U.S. foreign exchange traders. ''There's thinness
and uncertainty in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the euro has dropped to new lows as investors
predicted that European authorities would not take aggressive
action to stimulate the economy. The euro is the single currency of
11 European nations and has been trading since January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Waxman said dollar trading was light against most other
currencies, specifically the yen, ahead of Tuesday's meeting of the
Federal Reserve Board, when Fed policy-makers are widely expected
to raise U.S. interest rates by half a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   The British pound rose to $1.5144, up from a four-year low of
$1.5022 in late trading Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also was quoted at 1.6917 Swiss francs, down from
1.7292, and 1.4879 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4901.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.1289 German
marks, down from 2.1724; 7.1401 French francs, down from 7.2860;
and 2,107.61 Italian lire, down from 2,150.69.

<HEADLINE> A Top Chinese Official Dies  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HUTZLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A top Chinese monetary official said by Hong Kong
media to have committed suicide out of worries over his health or a
corruption scandal has died, a Chinese official confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's Ming Pao newspaper said Li Fuxiang died Wednesday
after jumping from the seventh floor of a Beijing hospital. As
director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, Li was
China's top foreign exchange regulator.
</P>
<P>
   An official in the administration's information office confirmed
that Li had died. However, the official, who only gave her surname,
Deng, refused to provide additional information, saying she was
awaiting instructions from superiors.
</P>
<P>
   Ming Pao and the Sing Tao Daily, another mainstream, independent
Hong Kong newspaper, said Li's death may have been related to
health, work pressure or financial problems. Sing Tao said he
suffered heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on a popular web site said Li had checked into the No.
304 Hospital, a military facility.
</P>
<P>
   A worker in the hospital's morgue confirmed that a person
staying in the ward reserved for senior officials had fallen to his
death and the body was found outside the hospital Wednesday
morning. Police came and removed the body, said the worker who
would not give his name.
</P>
<P>
   The internal investigation bureau of China's ruling Communist
Party recently questioned Li about corruption involving China
Everbright Bank, Sing Tao reported.
</P>
<P>
   Everbright Bank's former chairman, Zhu Xiaohua, was removed last
summer reportedly while under investigation for economic problems,
an allegation the company denied. Zhu had run the government's
foreign exchange administration for two years. Around the time Zhu
left the agency in 1995, Li became a deputy director.
</P>
<P>
   Li, 47, was promoted to head of the foreign exchange
administration in October 1998. The administration sets policies
and oversees the flow of foreign currency, an important mission in
China. China's currency, the yuan, is not fully convertible on
international markets.
</P>
<P>
   Under Li, the administration tightened controls on foreign
exchange to stop illegal outflows that were pressuring China to
devalue the yuan.
</P>
<P>
   Li's death and its possible connection to the rumored but never
confirmed investigation into China Everbright could add to scandals
already embarrassing Chinese leaders. China Everbright Bank is one
of China's more innovative and profitable banks. Its parent
company, China Everbright Group, which Zhu also ran, is controlled
by the State Council, the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders have been trying to curb rampant corruption that
has eroded popular support for Communist Party rule. But they have
limited the wholly state-controlled media's reporting on
corruption. They fear that revelations about the involvement of
senior officials could further damage the party's image.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation into billions of dollars of smuggling through
the southeastern port of Xiamen has implicated the wife of Beijing
party secretary Jia Qinglin, party sources have said. President
Jiang Zemin, a mentor of Jia, ordered public denials that either
Jia or his wife were involved.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Li Fuxiang's death, the spokesman's office for the
State Council said it had no information.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Touts Trade Bill in Midwest  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHAKOPEE, Minn. (AP) -- Beside a vast field of soybeans,
President Clinton argued Friday that open trade with China will
help the communist nation move closer to democracy and suggested
that U.S. opponents are aligning themselves with China's most rigid
communist traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The president toured a 1,500-acre farm run by Terry Hauer and
his father, Gene. Like many farmers here, the Hauers figure the
trade bill will make them more competitive with state-subsidized
producers in China.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter how hard I work, or how much I cut my costs, I
simply can't compete with subsidized corn,'' said farmer Dallas
Bohnsack.
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill, he said, would eliminate the subsidies and
enable him to garner a greater share of corn sales to China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said China has already begun cutting back on certain
crops, such as wheat, in preparation for the entry of American
crops.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no way the Chinese farmers can keep pace with the
growth of their own consumers, but American farmers can,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several local farmers, in baseball caps and striped shirts,
gathered before a stage surrounded by bundles of hay to hear
Clinton's free-trade pitch. Also in the crowd was Walter Mondale,
former vice president and former ambassador to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked the crowd to look past China's sad record on human
rights to consider the changes that an American economic presence
can foster there.
</P>
<P>
   ''We get frustrated, but China is an old country, and it's
changing fast,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can tell you that we'll have a lot more influence on Chinese
foreign policy ... if we have an open hand of working with them,
than if we say no, if we turn our backs on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Shakopee, a rural town outside Minneapolis, is represented by
Rep. David Minge, D-Minn., who is backing the trade legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota ranks seventh in the United States for exports,
sending $2.4 billion in agricultural products abroad in 1998.
Minnesota products include soybeans, meal, seed corn, beef and
pork.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton toured the Hauer farm with Minge and Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said there are still a handful of House members from
agricultural districts who remain undecided about the trade
legislation. ''I think it's tight, but I think generally, it's
going in our direction,'' Glickman told reporters on Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we'll win this vote, but I think it's going to be a
very close vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president left Washington to build for support for extending
permanent normal trade relations. He visited places where opinion
on the matter ran to either extreme.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, where union opposition runs high, Clinton was greeted
by protesters whose signs made their sentiments clear: ''No blank
checks for China.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton discussed the trade legislation with labor and business
leaders at a National Guard armory in North Canton, Ohio, far from
union protesters gathered in small clusters on nearby roads
</P>
<P>
   The president said the trade deal will create, not steal away,
American jobs. He cast the need for open trade with China in terms
of national security, saying the United States needs access to
China's markets to ''reduce the likelihood of conflict, even war''
in Asia for the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't pass it, it will increase the chances that
something bad will happen,'' Clinton said. ''That's not a threat,
and goodness knows if I didn't prevail, I would pray that I was
wrong. I believe I know what I'm talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said one of the ''great ironies'' of this trade
debate is the fact that American liberals are aligned in opposition
to the legislation with ''militant elements'' of the Chinese
military and operators of China's state-run industries. These
people in China want the subsidies to continue and ''want to keep
their thumb on the little folks in China,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an unusual thing to see that some of the most progressive
people in our country are taking a position that is supported by
only the most regressive people in their country,'' Clinton said.
''They know if they open up China, their control will be
undermined.''

<HEADLINE> Deal Creates Largest Ad Company  </HEADLINE>
By SKIP WOLLENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In the advertising industry's biggest buyout,
WPP Group PLC is paying about $4.3 billion in stock for Young &AMP;
Rubicam Inc., which created the Jell-O jingle, invited soda
drinkers to ''Be a Pepper'' and made Snoopy an insurance salesman.
</P>
<P>
   The deal announced Friday after a rocky four-month courtship
will make London-based WPP Group, which also owns the venerable
U.S. ad companies J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, the
world's largest ad and marketing company.
</P>
<P>
   Its chief executive, Martin Sorrell, said the deal may trigger
more consolidation in the ad industry in an effort to assemble the
resources companies are demanding to distinguish themselves and
reach potential customers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''This creates a combination that will be hard to beat,'' said
Tom Bell, the chief executive of Y&AMP;R. He had been asked to become
chairman of WPP but intends to leave the combined company after a
transition period so it will be clear that Sorrell is in charge.
</P>
<P>
   The 77-year-old Y&AMP;R, which went public only two years ago,
brings a prestigious roster of clients including AT&AMP;T,
Cadbury-Schweppes and Colgate-Palmolive.
</P>
<P>
   It also works for a number of important clients who also employ
the Thompson and Ogilvy agencies, such as Ford Motor Co., Kraft
Foods and Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R created the ad campaign that tunefully reminded kids and
shoppers how to spell Jell-O and another melodic pitch for Dr
Pepper. It was behind the ''I'm stuck on Band Aids'' campaign for
Johnson &AMP; Johnson years ago and more recently created the hip
animated Colonel for KFC. Its ads for MetLife featured the Peanuts
characters Snoopy and Woodstock in a variety of roles.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrell declined in a telephone news conference to disclose the
reactions of the two ad companies' clients to the buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Bell told shareholders at Y&AMP;R's annual meeting earlier that ''we
are quite comfortable with the responses we have received'' in
discussions with its major clients.
</P>
<P>
   WPP expects to cut costs by about $30 million in the first full
year after the deal closes. Sorrell declined to say how many jobs
may be affected.
</P>
<P>
   The deal offers Young &AMP; Rubicam shareholders a choice of either
0.835 of a WPP American Depositary Receipt or 4.175 new WPP shares
for each Y&AMP;R share.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, WPP ADR's fell 5.5 percent, or $3.50 a share, to $60
while Y&AMP;R shares fell 1.3 percent, or 62{ cents, to $47.75 on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Dougherty, who follows ad stocks for Prudential Securities,
said he couldn't explain why the investors were pushing the stock
prices lower.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good deal for both companies. It achieves both their
objectives and helps them leapfrog into the upper echelons of the
advertising and marketing services business.''
</P>
<P>
   The takeover still requires shareholder and regulatory approval.
WPP expects to complete the buyout by this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrell and Bell said they expected investors would become more
impressed with the potential of the company being created as they
explain it in detail in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their high-profile ad agencies, the companies
also have huge media-buying services that could collectively carry
even more clout with broadcast and print outlets for favorable
rates and placements.
</P>
<P>
   They each own large PR agencies -- WPP has Hill &AMP; Knowlton while
Y&AMP;R has Burson-Marsteller. They also have direct marketing
agencies, market researchers, healthcare advertising specialists
and Internet agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company would handle billings estimated by the
trade publication Advertising Age at nearly $64 billion. That would
push WPP, which had been the world's third-biggest ad organization
in 1999, ahead of Interpublic Group of Companies at $47.2 billion
and Omnicom at $45.55 billion. Billings measure the amount of ad
spending that an ad company handles for its clients.
</P>
<P>
   WPP and Y&AMP;R began talks in January, but the discussions broke
down in mid-March amid disagreement over Y&AMP;R's demands for autonomy
and WPP's proposals for tough restrictions on executives who leave
Y&AMP;R after the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The talks resumed in mid-April, broke down again on April 28 and
resumed May 4.
</P>
<P>
   The French ad company Publicis SA talked with Y&AMP;R about a
combination but disclosed on Monday that it had decided against
making an offer. Bell said Publicis was interested only if the deal
with WPP collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest takeover in the ad industry to date was the French
Havas Advertising SA's $2.1 billion deal announced in February for
Snyder Communications Inc.

<HEADLINE> Struggle To Contain N.M. Blaze  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MacDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- The blowtorch winds and searing heat
that fed a raging wildfire broke Friday, easing the threat to Los
Alamos from a blaze that destroyed 260 homes, damaged the town's
nuclear weapons laboratory and forced 25,000 people to flee.
</P>
<P>
   The fire remained out of control in the nearby forests and
canyons, however, and residents were told they could not return to
their houses for at least a week.
</P>
<P>
   ''This fire is not over with and nobody here is pretending it
is,'' Gov. Gary Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze began as a government-prescribed burn to clear brush.
On Friday, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said the government
would suspend those burns in the dry western United States for 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who fled on Wednesday faced the anxiety of not
knowing whether their homes were still standing. The blaze swept
through some homes like a flaming scythe, while neighboring homes
were left unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   In a Red Cross shelter at a high school in Santa Fe, anxious
residents crowded around TV sets, watching round-the-clock news
footage to see whether their homes were still there. Others logged
on to four computers at the shelter to scan a list posted on the
county Web site of destroyed houses.
</P>
<P>
   A few dialed their home numbers. A busy signal was taken as a
bad sign.
</P>
<P>
   ''We called our home and it was ringing, and we called a few of
our relatives' homes and it was ringing. We felt that's a good
indication our houses are still standing,'' said James Robinson,
who sat at the shelter with his wife and five children, the
youngest 13 months old.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers had planned to escort some residents to their
homes Saturday to pick up clothes, medicine and other belongings
but later decided the town remained too unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Across New Mexico, months of drought have left the state tinder
dry. More than 200,000 acres have burned already -- nearly four
times the total for all of last year -- and the fire season has just
begun.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 200 miles to the south, a fire in the Sacramento
Mountains, sparked by a downed power line, blew up to 20,000 acres
Friday, rivaling the Los Alamos fire.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze forced the evacuation of the southern New Mexico towns
of Sacramento and Weed and surrounding rural areas, said Rick
Hartigan, a fire information officer. He did not know how many
people had fled or whether any homes had been burned.
</P>
<P>
   The break in the weather in northern New Mexico gave
firefighters hope of holding the line against the Los Alamos fire.
It was still growing Friday, but at a slower pace, and firefighters
expected winds to remain calm through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Crews used bulldozers and hand tools to cut brush and dig
trenches in still-standing neighborhoods, fearful the flames still
might take an unexpected turn. Overnight, other crews took
advantage of lower temperatures and higher humidity to burn trees,
grass and brush about five miles from town, hoping to deprive the
fire of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can say with a high degree of confidence that we will not
have more structures burned in Los Alamos or White Rock,'' said
Doug MacDonald, the Los Alamos fire chief.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze was deliberately set May 4 to destroy brush at
Bandelier National Monument, but it raged out of control and swept
through about 28,000 acres by Friday. Roy Weaver, the Bandelier
superintendent who gave the go-ahead for the burn despite an
ominous weather forecast, was placed on leave with pay Thursday
pending an investigation. Officials expect to receive a report on
the cause of the fire Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos was framed by destruction, with houses reduced to
charred rubble and twisted metal. In one driveway, the fiberglass
shell of a sports car had fused with the concrete. In another yard,
a melted Big Wheel sat next to the seared remnants of a children's
playset.
</P>
<P>
   Residents and firefighters spoke with the imagery of war, using
words like ''attacked'' to describe the struggle with the fire,
which at one time surged so ferociously that firefighters dropped
their hoses and equipment and ran for safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''It came roaring down like a freight train off the mountain,''
said Ed Pullian, a battalion chief who had slept just seven hours
over three nights. ''We didn't have a chance. We kept retreating,
retreating, retreating and kept getting overrun.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos, 70 miles north of Albuquerque, is essentially a
company town for the nuclear laboratory, which employs 7,000 people
at buildings scattered throughout the city. It was the base of
operations in the 1940s for the Manhattan Project, which built the
atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   At the weapons lab, flames burned trailers and portable
buildings and came within 300 yards of a plutonium storage
facility. But lab officials insisted that dangerous materials were
protected in facilities strong enough to withstand the crash of a
747.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, the lab appeared out of danger, and all of the
facility's major buildings were unscathed, said Richard Burick,
deputy lab director for operations.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance agents had arrived near Los Alamos to begin the
monumental process of sorting claims. State officials have
suggested the costs could go as high as $1 billion, and there has
already been talk of federal compensation for the fire that got out
of hand.

<HEADLINE> Pope To Visit Portugal  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   FATIMA, Portugal (AP) -- Pope John Paul II joined more than
100,000 pilgrims in silent prayer in this small town Friday as he
prepared to beatify a shepherd boy and girl where they said they
spoke to the Virgin Mary 83 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Waving aside health concerns raised by Vatican hierarchy, the
pope knelt carefully before folding his trembling hands for five
minutes of prayer during a 45-minute appearance. This northern
Portuguese settlement of 8,000 is expected to swell to a million by
the end of his 24-hour visit.
</P>
<P>
   The pope flew in a camouflaged military helicopter emblazoned
with a cross from the capital of Lisbon to a soccer field outside
Fatima, where he embraced small children and briefly caressed the
heads of many in the teary crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Joyous local priests kissed his hand before he rode the
popemobile through ecstatic crowds to pray at Fatima's Chapel of
Apparitions, built where the Virgin Mary allegedly appeared to
three shepherd children on May 13, 1917.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise gesture, John Paul donated to the Virgin of Fatima
a gold ring his late mentor Warsaw Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski, the
Polish primate, gave him in 1978 when he became pope.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the pope is to beatify Jacinta Marto and her
brother Francisco who said the Virgin Mary appeared to them and
their cousin Lucia de Jesus dos Santos six times above an olive
tree and told them three secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The brother and sister died of pneumonia two years after the
visions, at the ages of 9 and 11. Dos Santos, now 93, has been at a
Carmelite convent in central Portugal since 1929. She will meet the
Pope on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Beatification is the final step before sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Weatherbeaten farmers, fashionably dressed youths and tourists
pitched tents on available space throughout the town, some enjoying
sunny picnics of wine and salads or touring hectic stalls for
statuettes of the Virgin Mary and porcelain plates featuring the
shepherd children.
</P>
<P>
   ''The beatification of children brings much more faith. It
proves children are good, innocent,'' said the 64-year-old
Portuguese pilgrim Rosarita de Armeida, motioning to crowds of
teen-agers in jeans and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's was John Paul's third visit to the shrine, considered
one of his favorites. The pope, who turns 80 next week, credits the
Virgin of Fatima with saving his life when he was wounded in a 1981
assassination attempt in St. Peter's Square. The shooting happened
on May 13, the day the first apparition of the Virgin is said to
have taken place in Fatima, 72 miles north of Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   When the pontiff came to Fatima on May 12 the following year to
thank the Virgin, he survived another assassination attempt as a
fundamentalist Spanish priest lunged at him with a bayonet,
accusing him of betraying the church.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of the pontiff's arrival, thousands crawled along a marble
walkway through Fatima's central square in penance or to honor a
promise to the Virgin.
</P>
<P>
   Many pilgrims hoped the pope, whose frailty is associated with
Parkinson's disease, would reveal the last of three secrets the
shepherd children said the Virgin told them.
</P>
<P>
   The first two foretold the end of World War I and the rise and
fall of communism.
</P>
<P>
   Dos Santos has told the third secret to several popes but the
Vatican has refused to disclose it.
</P>
<P>
   The Fatima visit is expected to be the pope's last foreign trip
this year.

<HEADLINE> USDA Forecasts Falling Crop Prices  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices for many crops are likely to fall again
this year, the government said Friday, but federal subsidies and an
expected multibillion-dollar bailout from Congress will more than
make up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for soybeans, corn and rice are all expected to decline
this year based on the stocks already available and the big crops
farmers are planting this spring, the Agriculture Department said.
Prices for wheat as well as beef and pork are projected to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Soybean prices are expected to decline for the fourth year in a
row to about $4.50, down from $4.65 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The main impact of the lower prices is likely to be on taxpayers
since grain and soybean prices already are below the government
support rates.
</P>
<P>
   USDA had expected to spend $7.2 billion in crop subsidies, known
as loan deficiency payments, this year. The price declines
projected Friday could increase the payments for this year's crops
by $500 million or more, said USDA economist Larry Salathe.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ''a lot can happen between now and September,''
when most of the crops are harvested.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is expected to provide at least $7 billion more in
special assistance to farmers this year, the third such bailout in
as many years. Commodity prices collapsed in 1998 because of
financial problems in Asia and heavy worldwide crop production and
are expected to recover slowly through the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can the government get out of farming? Unfortunately, no,''
Idaho farmer Klaren Pete Koompin said at a House Agriculture
Committee hearing Friday in Boise, Idaho. ''The world free market
is somewhat like trying to define the family farm. It may look good
on paper, but very seldom works in reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The price declines are unlikely to have much impact in
supermarkets, because the cost of raw ingredients and animal feed
accounts for a relatively small portion of consumer food prices.
</P>
<P>
   The government may be overestimating the size of this year's
crops, said Bill Nelson, an analyst with A.G. Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got some major weather problems in the Midwest, the
Southeast and in Texas. Until those are resolved with more
favorable weather conditions, you have to maintain some downside
risk in crop production and upside risk in prices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is expected to provide an additional $7 billion in
special assistance to farmers this year, the third such bailout in
as many years. Commodity prices collapsed in 1998 because of
financial problems in Asia and heavy worldwide crop production and
are expected to recover slowly through the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   The year is shaping up much better for cattle and hog producers.
Prices for hogs, which fell as low as 8 cents per pound in late
1998, are expected to average between 44 to 46 cents this year, up
from 34 cents in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Beef prices are estimated at 68 to 71 cents this year, compared
to 65.5 cents in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat prices, which averaged $2.50 per bushel in 1999, are
expected to rise to about $2.75 this year, which is above the
government support rate of $2.58 but still well below the prices
growers got in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. production of winter wheat is down 3 percent this year, as
a drought severely damaged the crop in Texas. The state is expected
to produce just 70.4 million bushels -- less than Ohio and five
other states -- compared to 122.4 million bushels in 1999. World
wheat production is expected to be down 1 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The price of corn, which averaged between $1.85 to $1.95 in
1999, is expected to range between $1.60 to $2 a bushel this year,
USDA said.
</P>
<P>
   Rice prices are expected to decline, too, because of large
domestic and global supplies. Prices should range from $4.75 to
$5.75 per hundred pounds, down from an average of $6.05 to $6.15
last year.

<HEADLINE> German Leader: Welcome Foreigners  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Stepping into a national debate on immigration,
Germany's president urged his compatriots Friday to show more
tolerance for foreigners and condemned politicians who play on
racist themes.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech marking his first year in office, President Johannes
Rau also said Germany must not be afraid to think about controlling
immigration if that would help ease the integration of 7 million
foreigners already living here.
</P>
<P>
   ''That people of different origins and cultures all live in our
country will not change,'' Rau said. ''We need a new effort so all
people in Germany can live together -- an effort without fears, and
without getting dreamy.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech to a Berlin audience of politicians, business leaders
and academics was the 69-year-old head of state's first major
address since his inauguration last May. The German president has
little power but is often viewed as the nation's conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder sparked the immigration debate with
recent plans to fill a high-tech labor shortage by offering special
visas to 20,000 foreign computer specialists.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative opposition called instead for a new law modeled
on U.S. immigration law to steer the flow of immigrants, giving
priority to highly qualified workers.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraging the debate, Rau said Germany ''should seriously
consider'' passing measures to regulate immigration because its
demand for workers was increasing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Immigration can't be left to chance,'' he said. ''We need
well-reasoned viable concepts that don't overburden anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Rau caused controversy at his inauguration last year when he
said he wanted to be president of all Germans -- including
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he condemned hate crimes against foreigners, urged
Germans to confront neo-Nazis and called for tough punishment for
perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   He also lashed out at politicians who play on anti-foreigner
themes. It was a veiled attack on Juergen Ruettgers, the
conservative gubernatorial candidate running in Sunday's elections
in North Rhine-Westphalia. Ruettgers has been running an
anti-immigration campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With 2 million Turks living among Germans, he also backed
Islamic religious instruction in public schools -- but only in
German.

<HEADLINE> Icahn Raises Bid for Nabisco Group  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Financier Carl Icahn has raised his bid for
Nabisco Group Holdings Corp. to $22 a share from $16 as part of the
continuing auction process that is under way for the company that
controls the maker of Ritz crackers and Oreo cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn, who already owns 9.5 percent of Nabisco Group stock, said
in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that
he planned to offer $19 in cash and $3 in two-year notes for each
remaining share of Nabisco Group., or about $6.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Icahn is probably not the only bidder, although no
others have been publicly identified.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco Group hired investment bankers last month to explore its
options after Icahn indicated he wanted to expand his stake in the
company and unseat the board so the new directors could take steps
to boost the value of its shares.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn eventually agreed to participate in the bidding process
and dropped his effort to elect his own slate to the board.
</P>
<P>
   But the Parsippany, N.J.-based company and the investment
bankers have declined comment on the state of the auction process.
Nabisco Group spokesman Henry Sandbach would only say there has
been significant interest in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Martin Feldman, who follows Nabisco Group for the
investment firm Salomon Smith Barney, said Friday he expects
Nabisco Group will fetch at least $25 a share at auction.
</P>
<P>
   He said there had been about 13 confidentiality agreements
signed that allow prospective bidders for Nabisco Group or the food
company it controls, Nabisco Holdings Inc., to examine the
company's financial records.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman said he did not know how many of these agreements have
resulted in bids.
</P>
<P>
   But among those who may be interested, Feldman said, are Philip
Morris Cos., which owns Kraft Foods, and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Holdings Co., the tobacco company spun off last year by Nabisco
Group's predecessor, RJR Nabisco Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Nabisco Group shares
rose $2.12{, or 12 percent, to $19.68}. Nabisco Holdings shares
gained 37{ cents to $43.93}.

<HEADLINE> Bush: Social Security Needs Changes  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HOLMES
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George W.
Bush said Friday he will propose changes in the Social Security
system because it's time to ''think differently'' about providing
for Americans' retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Without going into details, Bush said allowing younger Americans
to have retirement savings accounts is an idea that deserves
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am optimistic that if the American people give my
administration a chance to come in office, that we can save and
secure Social Security,'' Bush said. ''I welcome the debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Social Security has become a contentious issue in the campaign,
with Democrat Al Gore criticizing Bush's support for diverting some
Social Security taxes into private investment accounts for workers.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning Friday in Portland, Ore., Gore didn't mention Bush
by name, but said the stock market is no place for Security
Security funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Think about what happens when that first generation of
Americans retires in a bear market,'' Gore said. ''They would be
left trying to live on worthless paper and we as a nation could be
stuck with sky-high bailout costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is to elaborate on his proposals Monday in a speech in
Ontario, Calif. Gore also is to address the subject Monday, in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor touched on the issue in a brief speech
broadcast from Austin to the Republican National Committee
Chairmen's Conference in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody said, 'Why are you bringing up such a touchy issue?'
I said because I'm running to lead is why,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a time for America to send a leader to Washington, D.C.,
who will work with both reform-minded Republicans and reform-minded
Democrats to not only save Social Security for the elderly today
... but to think differently -- like personal savings accounts -- so
younger workers will be able to have a retirement system in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also promised the GOP leaders that a tax cut would be a
cornerstone of his campaign for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know we've got enough money to not only meet governmental
needs, enough money to pay down debt, enough money to strengthen
Social Security, and we've got money left over. And I understand
that money is not the government's money, it is the people's
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush poked fun at some news coverage of his meeting this week
with defeated Republican rival Sen. John McCain, especially those
who said the two men didn't seem very close.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know a lot of people were trying to analyze the body
language of the press conference,'' Bush said. ''Sometimes when
you're standing in front of 250 members of the press corps, or 200
members of the press corps, the body language can be a bit altered
somewhat with all those faces staring at you.
</P>
<P>
   ''But John and I had a fabulous meeting,'' he said. ''There's
much more that unites us than divides us.''

<HEADLINE> FAA Could Delay Flights at O'Hare  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A summer of long lines and flight delays could be
in store at O'Hare International Airport if federal aviation
officials and pilots can't work out a plan governing takeoffs and
landings at intersecting runways, experts said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has set a May 27 deadline
for its new rules to take effect. But pilots unions say they
haven't had enough time to study the changes and make sure they are
safe.
</P>
<P>
   If the deadline passes without an agreement, the pilots will
have to stop ''land and hold short'' operations that have allowed
for faster takeoffs and landings at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a huge headache,'' said Craig Burzych, an
O'Hare representative for the National Air Traffic Controllers
Association. ''It's going to cause delays -- a lot of upset
passengers, a lot of late passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   The worries come as a separate dispute between United Airlines
and its pilots wreaks havoc on passengers' travel plans, with 197
flights canceled Friday, according to United spokesman Joe Hopkins.
Many pilots are refusing to work overtime because of a lack of
progress in contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   The land and hold short operation at issue in the Chicago
squabble is a procedure used when two airplanes are on intersecting
runways, with one cleared to land and another ready to depart.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, pilots who are landing can agree to ''hold short,''
or stop at a designated point before the intersection of the
runways. As a result, air traffic controllers can more quickly
clear planes to depart from the other runway.
</P>
<P>
   Such procedures have been in effect at O'Hare for more than 30
years. But pilots' safety concerns prompted the FAA last year to
impose greater restrictions on the operations. These included
allowing them only in dry weather and barring foreign aircraft from
participating.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those restrictions are to be eased May 27, but pilots,
controllers and other airlines players are arguing that the changes
haven't been thought through and should be discussed at a national
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokeswoman Elizabeth Isham Cory said that if no agreement
is reached by May 27, all land and hold short operations will have
to cease at O'Hare.
</P>
<P>
   The effect will be ''like it is now on a rainy day,'' Cory said,
although she could not say how much of a delay the average
passenger might expect.
</P>
<P>
   Burzych said the land and hold short operations now allow
controllers to clear two to three airplanes a minute for departure
on the approved intersecting runways at O'Hare. If those operations
were banned, there would be about one departure every two to three
minutes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, along with the
Air Line Pilots Association, the Allied Pilots Association and
representatives from United and American airlines, sent a letter to
the FAA on May 4 outlining their concerns with the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Overman, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association,
said airline pilots are worried about a provision allowing general
aviation pilots -- from businessmen to student pilots -- to
participate in the land and hold short operations.
</P>
<P>
   Another major sticking point is an FAA requirement that O'Hare
pilots, controllers and airlines begin computer modeling by May 27
to prevent an accident in the rare case that a pilot cleared to
land must pull back up, creating a potential danger if another
plane is departing from the intersecting runway. The O'Hare groups
say they haven't been given enough time to come up with a modeling
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our attitude is where safety is concerned, it's always better
to be conservative,'' Overman said.
</P>
<P>
   Cory said she is optimistic the issue will be resolved before
the deadline.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Nominates Five Judges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton announced Friday that he has
nominated five people to U.S. District Court benches in Illinois,
Texas and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   John Darrah of Naperville, Ill., has been nominated to the

adjunct professor at Northern Illinois University's College of Law
since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Lefkow of Chicago also has been nominated to the Northern
District of Illinois. She has been a federal bankruptcy judge in
the district since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Morado of San Benito, Texas, was Clinton's pick for the
Southern District of Texas. Since 1987, Morado has been a partner

<HEADLINE> Illinois Boy Wins Top Math Prize  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An eighth-grader from Aurora, Ill., won the
national MathCounts competition Friday, solving an algebra problem
to beat out 227 other ''mathletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruozhou ''Joe'' Jia, 14, a pupil at Washington Middle School,
solved the equation in 15 seconds. Contestants in the finals have
45 seconds to solve each problem, hit the buzzer and answer
correctly.
</P>
<P>
   The final question was: ''A lecture hall has 40 rows of seats.
There are 10 seats in the first row, 12 seats in the second row,
and so on, with two more seats in each row than in the previous
row. How many seats are in the lecture hall?
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois student's correct answer, ''1,960,'' won him a gold
medal, an $8,000 scholarship, a laptop computer and an
expenses-paid week at the original U.S. Space Camp in Huntsville,
Ala. At the NASA camps, children learn about space flight, using
flight simulators and weightlessness tanks just like astronauts in
training.
</P>
<P>
   The competition, held here since 1983, is sponsored by the CNA
Foundation as well as several education groups and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Jia, who wants to become an engineer, has already completed a
year of algebra.
</P>
<P>
   He said he computed his answer on pencil and paper this way:
''a1'' plus ''an'' multiplied by ''n'' divided by 2 equals ''x,''
where ''x'' is the number of seats in the lecture hall.
</P>
<P>
   He came in second place in last year's contest.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Jia said, he solved about 4,000 math problems this
year to practice for the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was sort of easy,'' he said. ''After you do the problems,
you start to see all of the connections between algebra and
geometry.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-place prize in the contest for seventh and eighth
graders went to Tiankai Liu, 14, who won a $6,000 scholarship. He
is an eighth-grader at the Harker School, a private school in San
Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Student state teams also competed. The team representing
California on Friday won the state title, a space camp trip,
computers and a $2,000 scholarship for each of the four team
members.
</P>
<P>
   The third-place winner of a $2,000 scholarship was Ho Seung
''Paul'' Ryu, an eighth grader at Southwest Junior High School, in
Lawrence, Kan.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 63 Points; Nasdaq Up 29  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Friday after the government's report
of a decline in wholesale prices in April helped quell recent
worries about rising interest rates. But investors took profits in
late afternoon, proving that a single positive report wasn't enough
to eliminate all their fears.
</P>
<P>
   Selling in the last hour of trading left the Dow Jones
industrial average up 63.40 at 10,609.37. The Nasdaq composite
index rose 29.48 to 3,529.06. Earlier in the session, each index
was up as much as 120 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow ended the week with a gain of 31.51 points, while heavy
selling on Monday and Wednesday left the Nasdaq down 287.76 points
for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mostly higher Friday. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 rose 13.15 to 1,420.96 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 1.55 to 490.94.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks initially shot higher Friday after the Labor Department's
Producer Price Index showed a 0.3 percent decline in April that
reversed two months of increases. It was the best showing on
inflation at the wholesale level since February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The benign report came after a series of indicators had showed
strength in the economy and raised worries that the Federal Reserve
would move aggressively to raise borrowing costs at the next
meeting of its policy-making committee on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices have seesawed in recent weeks as investors
alternately fretted and relaxed about interest rates. Friday's
report removed a measure of nervousness from the market, but didn't
change most analysts' expectations that the Fed will raise rates by
a half-percentage point at Tuesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The results represent a fine performance on inflation,'' said
Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America. Still,
he said, ''we'll stick with the call for 50 basis points (half a
percentage point) at next week's meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Many investors shared Moran's view and opted to stay out of the
market until the Fed's meeting has passed. Those who were willing
to put money to work remained cautious, taking some profits from
sharp gains on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some skepticism in the market going into the Fed's
meeting,'' said Richard A. Dickson, a technical analyst at Scott &AMP;
Stringfellow in Richmond, Va. ''That's taken some of the glow off
the attempts to rally.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, technology stocks have stumbled amid the
continuing belief that prices were bid too high last year and early
this year. Investors are beginning to nibble at stocks that have
been knocked down to more reasonable prices, Dickson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate to use the word 'bargain' in reference to technology
stocks, but there is some bargain-hunting going on there,'' he
said. Dell Computer, which released an upbeat earnings report late
Thursday, rose 5 3/16 to 49~. Sun Microsystems rose 4 11/16 to 81{.
</P>
<P>
   Agilent, a spinoff of Hewlett-Packard, soared 13 7/16 to 90
after a Goldman Sachs analyst said the company is a likely addition
to the S&AMP;P 500. Agilent's full split from its parent company takes
effect June 2.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks were mixed after J.P. Morgan analyst Susan
Walker White lowered her price target for nearly a dozen companies
in the sector. Among the stocks she singled out: Switchboard, which
fell 1 to 10[.
</P>
<P>
   But larger companies that White downgraded remained unscathed.
Online auctioneer eBay closed up 3 9/16 to 121 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 1.05 billion shares,
compared with 1.14 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.8 percent, coming
back from a steep selloff of 4.6 percent the day before.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Germany's Xetra DAX index edged up 0.1 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 1.1
percent.

<HEADLINE> Strong Quake Shakes N. Chile  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- A strong earthquake rocked northern Chile
and Argentina Friday, setting off a landslide at a copper mine that
killed a miner.
</P>
<P>
   The temblor struck at 2:45 p.m. and had a preliminary magnitude
of 6.8, the Seismological Institute of the University of Chile
said.
</P>
<P>
   The quake, which temporarily cut telephone links to some areas
in northern Chile, had its epicenter in a sparsely populated area
near the northern Argentine city of Salta, about 100 miles from the
Chilean border. There were no reports of damage or injury in
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The quake was strongly felt in the Chilean city of Antofagasta,
520 miles north of Santiago, according to Alberto Maturana, head of
the government's Emergency Office.
</P>
<P>
   The temblor was also felt hundreds of miles to the south and
north of Antofagasta and as far away as parts of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-year-old miner was buried by a landslide in a mine in
Tierra Amarilla, 510 miles north of Santiago, Deputy Interior
Minister Jorge Burgos said.
</P>
<P>
   The regional governor, Armando Aranciba, called the death ''a
painful but isolated incident.'' There were no other immediate
reports of death or injury.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Manager Shot in Haiti  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Three gunmen shot to death a local
campaign manager in Haiti, a political leader said Friday, in the
latest violent incident before the nation's long-delayed
legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
   Branord Sanon was shot three times at dawn while trying to hail
a taxi in Port-au-Prince, said senate candidate Marie-Laurence
Jocelyn Lassegue, a prominent member of Sanon's party.
</P>
<P>
   Sanon was going to Baraderes, a coastal town 83 miles west of
the capital, where he was running the campaign for his cousin,
Louiseul Sanon, a candidate for Haiti's lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Sanon's Open the Gate party is a sometimes critical ally of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Increased political violence has led many Haitians to question
whether local and legislative elections can be held as scheduled on
May 21 and June 25. At least 15 people, five of them local campaign
managers, have been killed in political violence since March 27.
</P>
<P>
   President Rene Preval called for elections after locking
lawmakers out of Parliament in January 1999. He appointed Premier
Jacques-Edouard Alexis and the electoral council by decree in March
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders have accused partisans of former President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide of trying to delay the parliamentary and
local elections so that candidates can benefit from Aristide's
popularity in presidential elections at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to killings, two opposition politicians have been
abducted. The latest, Lesly Tilus of the Haitian Democratic Party,
one of more than 30 mayoral candidates for eastside Delmas, turned
up Tuesday, telling a radio station he had been kidnapped. He did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The insecurity has led most candidates to stop campaigning. Some
candidates have withdrawn their candidacies and the enthusiasm of
many voters has been dampened. The government last week banned all
street marches until after elections to prevent violence.
</P>
<P>
   A record 4 million voters have registered, and more than 29,000
candidates are competing for thousands of offices. Some 11,000
voting places are being installed.

<HEADLINE> Army To Award 21 Asian Americans  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Twenty-one Asian-American veterans of World
War II will receive the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest honor
for valor in combat, for their heroism in France, Italy and the
Philippines, the Army announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said earlier this week it would present medals
at a ceremony June 21 but the identity of only one of the
recipients was made public then: Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, who
lost his right arm in combat in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen of the 21 men were members of either the 100th Infantry
Battalion or the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, both of which were
all-volunteer units and were among the most decorated units in U.S.
military history.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 21, a Medal of Honor recommendation for
another Japanese American, James Okubo, has been okayed but cannot
be formally approved until Congress waives a statutory time limit
for his case.
</P>
<P>
   Okubo was an Army medic and received a Silver Star for his
actions near Biffontaine, France, in October and November 1944. He
was cited for extraordinary heroism in several separate battles in
which he saved the lives of members of the 100th Infantry Battalion
and 442nd Regimental Combat Team while repeatedly exposing himself
to enemy fire, the Army said in disclosing the names of all 22
honorees.
</P>
<P>
   It was on a steep forest ridge in France's Vosges Mountains east
of Biffontaine that the 100th Infantry Battalion and 442nd
Regimental Combat Team fought perhaps their most famous battle, the
epic rescue in October 1944 of the ''Lost Battalion'' of the 141st
Infantry Regiment of 36th Division (a former Texas National Guard
unit) whose ranks had been cut off and decimated by German forces
for days.
</P>
<P>
   The 21 veterans whose Medals of Honor will be presented June 21
at the White House all had received the Distinguished Service
Cross, the second-highest military award, for their heroics. In
1996 the Congress authorized the Army to review the records of the
104 Asian American veterans of World War II who had been awarded
the Distinguished Service Cross and determine if some deserved to
be upgraded to Medals of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   ''These American heroes sacrificed much for our nation and we
are privileged to honor them properly,'' Army Secretary Louis
Caldera said.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans approved to receive the Medal of Honor are:
</P>
<P>
   --Staff Sgt. Rudolph B. Davila, of the 7th Infantry, for action
on May 28, 1944, at Artena, Italy.

<HEADLINE> Friday's Commodities Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By BENNIE M. CURRIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crude oil prices were higher while other energy futures were
mixed Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange as the market
reacted to word from Mexico and Venezuela that OPEC and its allies
were prepared to maintain market stability.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Tellez, Mexico's energy minister, and a Venezuelan energy
official both issued guarantees that OPEC would boost oil supplies
to stave of higher prices. Mexico, one of the leading oil producers
not in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, would
support a move to keep prices down, according to Tellez.
</P>
<P>
   In other markets, soybeans prices fell slightly Friday on the
Chicago Board of Trade while corn and wheat prices closed higher as
investors reacted to the Agriculture Department's crop report.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC currently is producing 26.6 million barrels of crude daily.
That's about 1 million barrels above its 25.6 million barrel target
set last March when OPEC members voted for an output hike of about
1.7 million barrels a day to bring down international oil prices
that had reached 10-year-highs.
</P>
<P>
   The cartel plans to review market conditions next month, a move
that could open the door to further production increases. On
Friday, Tellez indicated confidence in OPEC's previous statements
that it will try to keep the price of oil between $22 to $28 a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ''The statement by Tellez obviously was meant to ease concern
that OPEC is prepared to act again if prices go up,'' said Phil
Flynn, the vice president and energy analyst for Alarton Trading
Corp. in Chicago. But this is an untested policy. The market is
retreating, saying 'Show me if it can work.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, light sweet crude for June delivery settled 51
cents higher at $29.62 a barrel after rising as high as $30.00 a
barrel in trading earlier on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In trading on other energy commodities, June heating oil fell
.48 cent to 76.83 cents a gallon; June unleaded gasoline rose .40
cent to 94.04 cents a gallon; June natural gas rose .02 cents to
$3.354 per 1,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   In London, June Brent crude from the North Sea rose $.60 to
$28.05 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it remains to be seen whether OPECs pricing
strategy will ward off renewed pressures from the U.S. to step up
production to reduce gasoline prices as Memorial Day and the annual
summer traveling season approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the market is poised to test OPEC's resolve,'' Flynn
said. ''And with prices hitting $2 a gallon at some pumps, people
are going to start getting outraged. When they start filling up
their SUVs and boats for all those vacations, somebody's going to
be screaming.
</P>
<P>
   In trading on other commodities, soybean futures finished lower
despite a USDA report released Friday that indicated that soybean
production will outpace last year's output by 12 percent. Investors
remained concerned about hot weather this weekend in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat prices closed higher, triggered by the USDA's estimate
that U.S. winter wheat production would exceed investors'
expectations while worldwide wheat production for the 2000-2001
season woud be down about 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for July delivery rose 2\ cents to $2.84 a bushel; July
corn rose 1 cent to $2.45} a bushel; July oats fell 1 cent to
$1.22\ a bushel; July soybeans fell 2} cents to $5.65} a bushel.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACO, Maine (AP) -- General Dynamics Corp. said Friday it agreed
to purchase machine gun maker Saco Defense for an undisclosed
amount of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Saco manufactures light and medium-caliber machine guns and is
the U.S. military's sole supplier of the MK-19 automatic grenade
launcher. Upon completion of the deal, Saco Defense will become
part of General Dynamics Armament Systems, based in Burlington, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their product line is very complementary to ours,'' said Clif
Bushey, vice president of strategic planning at General Dynamics
Armament Systems. ''This acquisition significantly expands our
ability to offer a full range of armament solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Saco Defense has 225 employees. Bushey said it was too early to
say what changes would be implemented as a result of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   General Dynamics, with headquarters in Falls Church, Va., has
annual sales of some $10 billion and is a leading supplier of
nuclear submarines and destroyers. New Colt Holding Corp., based in
West Hartford, Conn., is a supplier of light arms.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Pull Back Sharply  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds prices fell Friday as a report showing a
drop in wholesale prices failed to change expectations the Federal
reserve will hike interest rates next week to fight inflationary
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 23/32
point, or $7.18} per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves
in the opposite direction, rose to 6.50 percent compared with late
Thursday's level of 6.42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year Treasury bond fell 13/16 point with the yield
jumping to 6.20 percent from 6.14 percent a day earlier, according
to Bridge Telerate news service.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-weekend selling came despite a report that wholesale
prices fell 0.3 percent in April, the first drop in 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   While encouraging, the data won't be enough to distract the Fed
from all the other recent reports that suggest the economy is
growing at an inflationary pace, analysts said, maintaining that
central bank officials will proceed with an expected interest rate
hike at next Tuesday's meeting. Rising inflation and interest rates
make fixed-income investments like bonds less appealing.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading Friday, short-term Treasury securities ranged
from 5/32 to 9/32 point higher, while intermediate maturities fell
{ to 19/32 point.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 6.10 percent while
the discount rate of 5.94 percent, up 0.01 percentage point. Yields
are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Six-month yields finished at 6.50 percent with a discount of
6.22 percent, rising 0.09 percentage point. One-year yields settled
at 6.37 percent with a discount of 6.06 percent, rising 0.09
percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, held steady at 6.06 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 3/16 to 92 1/16. The average yield to
maturity rose to 6.22 percent compared with late Thursday's 6.20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices were little changed Thursday following the prior
day's big gains as investors turned cautious again before next
week's expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 3/32
point, or 93} cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which
moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.40 percent compared with
late Wednesday's level of 6.42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year Treasury bond also rose 3/32 point with the yield
slipping to 6.14 percent from 6.15 percent a day earlier, according
to Bridge Telerate news service.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, worried that heavy spending is aggravating
inflationary pressures, were heartened by a morning report that
revealed a surprise 0.2 percent drop in retail sales during April.
</P>
<P>
   While it was the first decline in nearly two years, economists
said the report wouldn't be enough to stop the Federal Reserve from
boosting interest rates again next week to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates and inflation make the fixed payoff on
bonds less appealing.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading Thursday, short-term Treasury securities ranged
from unchanged to 1/32 point lower, while intermediate maturities
were unchanged to 1/32 point higher.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills held steady at 6.09 percent
while the discount was unchanged at 5.93 percent. Six-month yields
were 6.41 percent with a discount of 6.14 percent, a gain of 0.01
percentage point. One-year yields were unchanged at 6.29 percent
while the discount held steady at 5.98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.

percent.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Residents Mourn Gators' Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAFETY HARBOR, Fla. (AP) -- Residents at the Sandal Cove
condominiums called him ''Little Al,'' an 8-foot alligator who for
years was spotted lying around the grassy commons.
</P>
<P>
   He never harmed anyone, and he was regarded as something of a
pet. But when Little Al decided to swim in the condo pool, the
state sent a trapper Thursday to take him away to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ''There wasn't a dry eye,'' said Jane Hogan, a six-year resident
at Sandal Cove.
</P>
<P>
   Residents tried for hours to coax him out of the pool.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was going back and forth, enjoying himself to the hilt,''
said Jerry Clunman. ''I almost gave him a towel.''
</P>
<P>
   They got him out, but by then someone had called the Florida
Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and a trapper was on his
way.
</P>
<P>
   Little Al and a 10-foot gator named Big Al have been fixtures at
Sandal Cove, lying around the commons near a pond that feeds into
Alligator Lake, residents said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither alligator had ever shown aggression toward people.
Residents have strolled the sidewalk within 10 feet of the reptiles
without fear.
</P>
<P>
   State policy requires trappers to destroy alligators they catch,
said Sharon Griffis, a Florida wildlife officer. ''Somebody could
have been bitten,'' Griffis said.
</P>
<P>
   But the condo residents are going to miss him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a bad day at Sandal Cove,'' Hogan said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jets Bomb Iraqi Air Defense  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. jets bombed military sites in
northern Iraq Friday for the third consecutive day after being
fired upon by Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery, the U.S. military
said.
</P>
<P>
   The artillery was based near Bashiqah, 250 miles north of
Baghdad, the Germany-based U.S. European Command said.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, the official Iraqi News Agency quoted an
unidentified military spokesman as confirming strikes by ''enemy
warplanes'' in northern Iraq. The spokesman said civilian
installations were hit, but gave no further details.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military denies targeting civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Operating out of Incirlik air force base in southern Turkey, the
United States and Britain have been enforcing northern no-fly zone
in Iraq since the end of the Gulf War in 1991. Allied forces also
impose a similar no-fly zone in the south of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   President Saddam Hussein, who says the zones violate Iraqi
sovereignty, has been challenging the patrols since December 1998.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Rebels OK Cease-Fire  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AP) -- As thousands of people knelt and
prayed for peace in mosques across Aceh province Friday, Indonesian
government and separatist rebel negotiators meeting in Switzerland
signed the first cease-fire agreement in 25 years of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking examples of the positive reaction by
the war-weary people to the first ray of hope in the territory came
from a rebel stronghold south of the capital, Banda Aceh.
</P>
<P>
   There, dozens of young, heavily armed guerrilla fighters put
down their weapons and gave thanks as they heard news that their
leaders and Indonesia's reformist government had signed the
landmark accord and would begin the three-month cease-fire on June
2.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is great news,'' said rebel commander Tengku Tarzura in
the well-camouflaged camp of flimsy bamboo huts. ''We will abide by
the cease-fire, but we still want independence and will struggle
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   And there lies the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Even though President Abdurrahman Wahid, Indonesia's first
democratically elected leader in 40 years, appears to have won the
tentative trust of Aceh's rebels, few people believe they will ever
accept his demand to remain part of Indonesia with limited
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may be celebrating in our mosques, and praying and reading
the Koran at home, because the agreement is better than nothing.
But we don't necessarily believe the peace will last here,'' said
Abdul Gani Nurdin, a university lecturer and human rights activist
in Banda Aceh.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed the
announcement and commended both sides ''for the important first
step they have taken towards the resolution of the problem in
Aceh,'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general hopes that a mutually acceptable political
solution can be found in the near future through strict adherence
to the agreement, ''the involvement of the wider Acehnese community
and a strong commitment to peace,'' Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 people have been killed in the fighting in Aceh
in the last decade, including 345 this year. Many of Aceh's 4.3
million people know someone who has died or disappeared during the
insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Embittered by a perceived economic exploitation and an
Indonesian military crackdown, the rebels are fighting not only for
independence, but also for a greater share of the profits from
their oil-rich region, and the right to impose Islamic religious
laws on the Acehnese people.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Wirayuda, Indonesia's permanent U.N. representative in
Geneva, and Zaini Abdullah, a rebel representative based in Sweden,
signed the ''joint understanding on a humanitarian pause'' at an
undisclosed location in Switzerland. The cease-fire will be
regularly reviewed for renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ''This joint understanding is an early step of a hundred-step
journey in the efforts to find a final solution of the Aceh
problem,'' Wirayuda said, adding that the rebels' demands for
independence hadn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum of understanding followed three rounds of talks
organized by the Geneva-based Henry Dunant Center for Humanitarian
Dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   A panel for humanitarian action and another for security
aspects, both based in Banda Aceh, will implement the deal. They
will be supervised by a monitoring team composed of ''five persons
of high integrity.'' A ''joint forum'' based in Switzerland will be
the highest decision-making body.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid, a Muslim cleric and reformist who took office in October,
has promised Aceh partial autonomy and a greater share of oil
profits and has reduced the number of soldiers fighting the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   He also has set up a human rights tribunal in Aceh, which is
trying Indonesian soldiers on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a lasting peace in Aceh is a major test for Indonesia, a
country made up of hundreds of different ethnic groups, languages
and several religions, as it continues its painful transition
toward democracy after three decades of authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Former dictator Suharto, whose 32-year reign came to an abrupt
and violent end in May 1998 during a student uprising, was renowned
for the harsh, repressive measures he ordered his military to use
in trying to stamp out Aceh's insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens after the cease-fire begins, it was clear
Friday that many people in Aceh couldn't wait for it to start,
given how tired they are of the fighting between the rebels and
Indonesian police and soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let peace come soon. Let the fighting end. Let God punish
those who violate the cease-fire,'' students chanted at No. 39, one
of the many crowded and poor public schools in Banda Aceh that
canceled classes Friday to pray that the peace talks would succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Banda Aceh, about 10,000 people crammed into the city's
largest mosque and prayed that there would be no more bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Many other towns across the province virtually closed down for
the day as people stayed home or prayed for peace at places of
worship.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Kennedy Views Airport Tape  </HEADLINE>
By LEON DROUIN KEITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rep. Patrick Kennedy and the airport guard
who said he assaulted her at a security checkpoint viewed a
videotape of the March incident Friday and gave their version of
events to a hearing officer.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on whether to file misdemeanor charges against the
Rhode Island Democrat will come in about a week, said Lawrence
Webster, assistant supervisory attorney for the city attorney's
office.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides met at a closed-door hearing at a Superior Court
office. Webster said most cases that go through such quasi-judicial
hearings are settled without charges filed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears to have been a successful meeting,'' Webster said
during a news conference after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Della Patton, 58, claims Kennedy shoved and grabbed her March 26
after she told him his bag was too big to fit through an X-ray
scanner at Los Angeles International Airport. She filed a battery
complaint with police.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than filing a misdemeanor battery charge, which carries a
penalty of up to six months in jail and a $2,000 fine, the city
attorney's office ordered Friday's hearing in hopes of resolving
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 32, the son of Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., has
expressed his ''regret that I acted rudely,'' but denied hurting
the woman.
</P>
<P>
   Patton's attorney, George L. Mallory Jr., said his client
''desires to go forward with a criminal case.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the airport security tape shows Kennedy pushing Patton
with his right hand, shoving her into the X-ray machine. Patton
remains arthritic, primarily in the shoulder, and is seeking
workers compensation, he said. She has not been back to work since.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement after the hearing, Kennedy said he was glad for
the opportunity to ''set straight what really happened'' and to
apologize to Patton.
</P>
<P>
   ''After viewing the tape for the first time today, there is
absolutely no question that Ms. Patton's allegations and press
descriptions about the incident are inaccurate,'' Kennedy said.
''As I have said all along, I look forward to the tape being
released to show how this matter has been blown so far out of
proportion.''

<HEADLINE> Woman abducted, shot by ex-boyfriend dies; witnesses say guard refused help </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A Seton Hall University student dragged
kicking and screaming into a car by her ex-boyfriend who later shot
her and himself died Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The university fired a guard accused of refusing to call for
help, and accepted the resignation of the guard's supervisor. Two
teen-age girls who witnessed the abduction say they begged the
guard to summon help, but he allegedly refused, telling them to
call police themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sohayla Hope Massachi, 23, died at 4:20 p.m. at University
Hospital in Newark, spokesman Rogers Ramsey said. She had been in
grave condition ever since police in Union County broke down the
door to her ex-boyfriend's apartment Wednesday afternoon to find
him dead and her grievously injured with a gunshot wound to the
back of the head.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Christopher Honrath, 24, dragged Massachi into
his car outside the campus, then drove to his Westfield apartment,
where he dragged her upstairs. They said he shot her, then himself
as police tried to enter the room after being summoned because of
the commotion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our prayers are with our student, Sohayla Massachi, and her
family during this trying time,'' Seton Hall said in a prepared
statement. ''The university has reviewed the claim that a security
guard failed to respond to a request for assistance from a
bystander. The outcome of the review has resulted in the dismissal
of the security guard from his assignment at Seton Hall. The
university has also accepted the resignation of the supervisor of
the security guard.''
</P>
<P>
   University spokeswoman Laurie Pine would not identify the guard,
the supervisor or the private company that had employed them, but
she said the company will continue to provide on-campus security.
</P>
<P>
   Two 17-year-old students at Columbia High School in Maplewood
said they witnessed the abduction at about 2:30 p.m., and asked the
guard to call for help.
</P>
<P>
   ''She tried to start running. She's screaming, 'Help me! Help
me!' '' Asia Davis told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Friday's
editions. Davis and her friend, Chituru Iromuanya, told the
newspaper they saw a man use a necktie to pull the woman into his
car.
</P>
<P>
   Iromuanya yelled at the man to let the woman go as Davis ran up
Seton Hall's driveway to a guard post.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'There's a woman being kidnapped out there. I have the
license plate number. She needs help.' He told me he couldn't do
anything because he's not a police officer,'' Davis told the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   She said the guard picked up his telephone and spoke to someone,
then hung up and told her to walk to South Orange police
headquarters to summon help.
</P>
<P>
   The university's Web site asserts that Seton Hall's security
office ''maintains frequent and current contact with the South
Orange Police Department ... A direct telephone tie-line between
the security office and the South Orange Police Department provides
instant contact with the police department, which is located less
than one-half mile from the campus. All security personnel are
equipped with two-way radios and maintain constant contact with the
dispatcher in the security office.''
</P>
<P>
   Pine did not respond to a request for further information on
security arrangements at the university.
</P>
<P>
   The girls said they ran to Iromuanya's house and called South
Orange police. An officer responded and took information, including
the car's license plate, from them.
</P>
<P>
   But by that time, authorities said, Honrath was already back at
his apartment with Massachi. Police officers knocked on the
apartment door at about 3 p.m. and yelled 'Police!'' They then
heard two shots fired inside the apartment, Assistant Union County
Prosecutor Robert O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing a hostage situation was unfolding, the officers
retreated and called for backup, including an emergency response
team, and evacuated neighbors. When no other sounds were heard from
the apartment for a prolonged period, officers decided to storm the
room at about 4:30, O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, they found Honrath dead of a self-inflicted gunshot
wound, and Massachi lying on the floor, moaning.
</P>
<P>
   The gun Honrath used had been reported stolen in Ossining, N.Y.,
in 1990, police said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said the prosecutor's office reviewed the response of
Westfield police, and concluded officers had acted properly under
the circumstances. But neither he nor Essex County Assistant
Prosecutor Charlotte Smith would comment on the actions of the
Seton Hall guard. South Orange and Westfield police did not return
numerous telephone calls from The Associated Press on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no legal obligation to assist someone,'' O'Leary said.
''The girls were told it didn't happen on campus and to report it
to local police.''

<HEADLINE> Alleged Killer on God's 'Mission'  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GRACZYK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Angel Maturino Resendiz, the Texas Railroad
Killer, has no remorse and no awareness that he committed any
horrendous crimes because he believes he is on a divine mission to
eliminate evil, a psychiatrist testified in his defense Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''That doesn't appear a recognition that he wants to stop and
can't,'' said Dr. Bruce Cohen, a forensic psychiatrist. ''He's
saying, 'I can't stop even if I wanted to, because God's force is
on my side and God wants me to destroy evil and that's why I can't
stop.'''
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz, 40, has pleaded innocent by reason of
insanity in the 1998 rape, bludgeoning and stabbing of a
Houston-area physician, Dr. Claudia Benton. He has admitted to
eight other killings -- five in Texas, two in Illinois and one in
Kentucky -- over a two-year period starting in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, a person can only be found innocent by reason
of insanity if the defense can prove the person was suffering from
a mental disease and couldn't discern right from wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who interviewed the defendant and reviewed dozens of his
letters from jail, spent his second day on the stand as testimony
in the capital murder trial was winding up its first week.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Cohen testified that Maturino Resendiz believes he
evaded police for so long because he moved at superhuman speed and
was protected by God, the psychiatrist said. Also, police tracking
dogs didn't want to confront a ''wolf-tiger angel with a dinosaur
look,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-examining Cohen Friday afternoon, Prosecutor Lyn McLellan
repeatedly accused Cohen of molding his opinion to fit the insanity
defense. Cohen said he had found only 10 percent of the several
hundred defendants he has evaluated for sanity to be insane.
</P>
<P>
   McLellan asked Cohen how he could be certain Maturino Resendiz
was insane at the time of killings since the psychiatrist did not
interview him until nine months later. Cohen responded that a
disease like paranoid schizophrenia develops over time, and that
Maturino Resendiz showed symptoms well before the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can have symptoms of diabetes at one time or another, but
you still have diabetes,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's proceedings also included a surprise comment from the
defendant, who has previously spoken only through letters.
</P>
<P>
   As McLellan cross-examined Cohen, Maturino Resendiz spoke out to
get State District Judge Bill's Harmon's attention. Harmon excused
the jury and allowed Maturino Resendiz to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just wondering, those letters to the media they got hold
of are confidential. I don't know how they got them. They did open
all of my mail, but they are confidential,'' Maturino Resendiz said
.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon noted the remarks and called the jury back to the
courtroom.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Dam Problem Needs Closer Eye  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Prodded by both local Democrats and his
presidential rival, Vice President Al Gore dipped a toe into the
debate here over salmon preservation Friday. He said he wants
scientists and the businessmen who would be affected by breaching
Snake River dams to study the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel it is irresponsible to make a decision or draw a
conclusion without consulting all of the parties involved and
without utilizing hard science,'' Gore told about 200 people Friday
at Portland Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ''I refuse to prejudge or play politics with this issue,'' he
said. ''We can develop a plan that can both protect the rivers and
restore salmon runs. Extinction here is not an option.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president had been urged by Democratic Gov. John
Kitzhaber and Sen. Ron Wyden to speak up on the issue. And
Republican rival George W. Bush said Thursday in an interview with
KGW-TV in Portland, ''My opponent ought to take a position on this
important issue, and the fact that he will not may indicate what
kind of president he will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has pledged to block any attempt to breach the dams.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, criticized the
vice president for calling for yet another study when the Armys
Corps of Engineers has been studying the matter in great detail
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again Al Gore has failed to lead on an issue important to
the voters of Oregon,'' Bartlett said. ''Governor Bush has made it
very clear of his oppositon to breaching the dams. And Al Gore
again refuses to state his position clearly. ... The issue has been
studied.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army Corps of Engineers is set to issue its opinion in the
fall, and is expected to suggest that the dams should stand at
least another five or 10 years while other measures are taken to
save the salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans, such as Sen. Slade Gorton of Washington, had
ridiculed Gore for saying South Carolina should take down the
Confederate flag over its Statehouse while calling the salmon
matter one that the state should decide.
</P>
<P>
   The debate centers on whether to breach four dams across the
Snake River to help save the region's famous but endangered salmon.
Industry and labor officials say that would threaten businesses and
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's appearance at the community college, a few days before
Oregon's May 16 presidential primary, focused on possible Social
Security changes and the vice president's disagreements with Bush
on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Kitzhaber and Wyden also had urged Gore to speak up on a Senate
bill that critics say would block Oregon's assisted suicide law.
Gore did not address that issue because he was not asked about it
at the appearance, Wyden said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., would
allow the government to ask physicians why they are prescribing
lethal doses of pain medication to terminally ill patients.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden said he and Gore both oppose assisted suicide but believe
the legislation could have a ''chilling effect'' on pain management
for the afflicted.

<HEADLINE> Authorities hunt for stolen shipment of potassium cyanide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LINDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Authorities hunted Friday for 20 drums of
potassium cyanide, a potent poison used in metal finishing, that
were stolen from a warehouse in Union County.
</P>
<P>
   The drums, each about as big as beer keg, were inside a shipping
container, along with machinery, car parts and tape measures, that
went missing May 4, Linden police Lt. Jeffrey Vitrano said.
</P>
<P>
   The gray trailer-sized container was hauled away by truck, and
those responsible were probably unaware of their deadly cargo,
Vitrano said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Viewing it from the outside, there was no way of knowing the
contents of the load,'' Vitrano told The Star-Ledger of Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization says potassium cyanide could be
used by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the wrong place, this is a very, very nasty thing,'' Steven
Marcus, executive director of the New Jersey Poison Information and
Education System, told The Star-Ledger.
</P>
<P>
   The manmade liquid kills by preventing oxygen from reaching
vital organs.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking it would would mean almost certain death, while
inhaling large amounts could be fatal, Marcus told the newspaper.
It is less likely to be absorbed through the skin, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Linden police notified the FBI, State Police, and county
prosecutors, and ask those with information to contact authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The shipping container was to be sent to Puerto Rico through the
Port of Philadelphia, Vitrano said.
</P>
<P>
   Potassium cyanide is often used in electroplating, a process
employed to make silverware and jewelry, Marcus said.

<HEADLINE> Hatch: Get Tough on Bounced Checks  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Debt collectors could phone people at any time
of day or night and charge them high fees if they fail to make good
on bounced checks within a month under a proposal championed by
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, R-Utah, is pushing the measure as an amendment to
legislation that would make it harder for people to erase debts
through bankruptcy, which has raised protests from consumer
advocates, unions, women's groups and religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, meanwhile, on Friday reaffirmed its support for
bankruptcy overhaul legislation in principle but said President
Clinton would veto the House-passed version in its current form.
The Senate bill is more acceptable, although the administration has
''serious concerns'' about some provisions, White House budget
director Jack Lew wrote in a letter to senior lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president supports balanced consumer bankruptcy reform
that would encourage responsibility and reduce abuses of the
bankruptcy system on the part of debtors and creditors alike,'' Lew
said. ''He believes that we can eliminate abuse without hurting
those forced to turn to bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lew's letter did not directly address Hatch's new proposal on
debt collectors. But it noted the administration's general view
that the bankruptcy legislation must contain ''appropriate
safeguards against coercive creditor practices that compel debtors
to forgo their rights and that disadvantage more scrupulous
creditors.''
</P>
<P>
   Current law has protections from creditor harassment. It
prohibits creditors, for example, from calling indebted consumers
late at night, repeatedly dunning them over the phone or
threatening criminal prosecution without legal grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, the Senate Banking Committee's
senior Democrat, said the proposal would unfairly ''allow
unfettered collection activities not only against the individual
writing a counterfeit check but also against the consumer whose
checks have been forged.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, there have been many cases in which consumers
whose checks had been stolen were subjected to ''harassing
collection tactics'' in violation of the Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act, Sarbanes wrote to Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the
Judiciary Committee's senior Democrat. He said Hatch's proposal
would allow the practice to continue legally.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was first reported in Friday's editions of The
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment would exempt collectors from the debt collection
practices law when the bounced checks in question have been
outstanding for 30 days or more.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, senators working behind closed doors to draft the
bankruptcy legislation announced Thursday that their House
counterparts had agreed to add several consumer protections to the
House bill that already were in the Senate-passed version.
</P>
<P>
   Credit card companies would be required to provide a toll-free
phone number for consumers to find out how long it would take them
to pay off their balances by making only minimum monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the companies would have to tell consumers the
exact date when late fees are charged and would be prohibited from
dropping customers who regularly pay their monthly balances in
full. When low introductory ''teaser'' rates are offered to lure
new credit card customers, the companies would have to disclose
clearly when the normal, higher rates would replace the ''teaser''
rates and what the higher rates would be.
</P>
<P>
   The same requirements would apply to credit card solicitations
made through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate bills, both passed by veto-proof margins,
would apply new standards for determining whether people filing for
bankruptcy should be forced to repay their debts under a
court-approved reorganization plan instead of having them
dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators are trying to meld the two bills
into one measure to be approved by both chambers and sent to
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say an overhaul is needed to stem abuse by people who
can afford to repay their debts. They point to the rise in personal
bankruptcies in recent years, which reached a record 1.4 million in
1998, despite the strong economy. That's up more than 300 percent
since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the legislation would hurt people who have suffered
financial misfortune as a result of losing their jobs, getting
divorced or having to pay huge medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bills are H.R.833 in the House, S.945 in the Senate.

   In 1846, the United States declared that a state of war already
existed against Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In 1917, three peasant children near Fatima, Portugal, reported
seeing a vision of the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1918, the first U.S. airmail stamps, featuring a picture of
an airplane, were introduced. (On some of the stamps, the airplane
was printed upside down, making them collector's items.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, President Eisenhower signed into law the St. Lawrence
Seaway Development Act.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, the musical play ''The Pajama Game'' opened on

Peter's Square by Turkish assailant Mehmet Ali Agca.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, a confrontation between Philadelphia authorities and
the radical group MOVE ended as police dropped an explosive onto
the group's headquarters; 11 people died in the resulting fire.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago: Two U.S. airmen were shot to death in the
Philippines on the eve of talks concerning the future of U.S.
military bases; the revolutionary New People's Army claimed
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago: Army Captain Lawrence Rockwood was convicted at

<HEADLINE> Father: Didn't Mean To Kill Kid  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SCHNEIDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAVARES, Fla. (AP) -- A man convicted of murder for beating his
6-year-old daughter testified Friday that he didn't mean to hurt
her and had sought repeated help from child welfare workers to deal
with his anger.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted help,'' Richard Adams tearfully told 12 jurors who
will recommend whether to send him to death row or give him a life
prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't mean to hurt my daughter. I didn't even mean to spank
her,'' he said. ''I tried to do the best job I could as a parent. I
lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, 26, was convicted of murder Monday for killing Kayla
McKean and burying her in the Ocala National Forest in November
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors were sent home Friday and were expected to begin
deliberating on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Adams reported his daughter missing the day before Thanksgiving
1998. Her picture was posted and hundreds of people mobilized into
search parties, forgoing their football games and turkey dinners to
look for the girl.
</P>
<P>
   The community's concern turned to disgust when police arrested
Adams. An investigation revealed child welfare workers repeatedly
had missed signs that Kayla was being abused by Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Kayla's death spurred significant changes in Florida's child
protection system and caused the firings and resignations of
several Department of Children and Families workers in the
district.
</P>
<P>
   During the last months of Kayla's life, Adams was interviewed
three times by investigators with Children and Families, which
opened a case on Kayla after Adams took her to a hospital for
injuries he said she suffered in a bike accident.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he asked for help from the investigators but didn't
receive any. Former DCF investigator Kelly Mahoney had testified
that Adams only asked about counseling for Kayla.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was running out of ways to time-out or discipline her
without getting physical with her,'' Adams said. ''I tried
everything and nothing worked.''

<HEADLINE> Small Plane Crash in Houston Kills 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- A twin-engine airplane stalled during takeoff and
crashed Friday at Houston Hobby Airport, killing all six people on
board, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The private plane was about 300 feet in the air when the engine
stalled and the plane nose-dived into a grassy area next to runways
just before noon, said Houston Aviation Department spokesman Ernie
DeSoto.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very violent crash scene,'' said J.R. Flanagan, a
Fire Department assistant chief.
</P>
<P>
   All passengers -- six men each at least 35 years old -- were
ejected on impact, and bodies and luggage were strewn about the
wreckage, DeSoto said.
</P>
<P>
   DeSoto said there was no distress call. Witnesses said the
engine stalled at least twice before the plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The 1970 Beechcraft Baron arrived from Austin, picked up at
least one passenger and refueled shortly before takeoff, DeSoto
said. The group was headed to Louisiana for a fishing trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will provide whatever technical assistance is needed to
determine the cause of the crash,'' said Jim Gregory, director of
corporate relations for Raytheon Aircraft Co., which owns
Beechcraft.
</P>
<P>
   He did not know if any maintenance was performed on the plane
while it was being refueled.
</P>
<P>
   ''This aircraft has an excellent safety reputation,'' Gregory
said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Hobby Airport is one of two major airports that serve
the nation's fourth-largest city. Houston Bush Intercontinental
Airport is the other.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the crash, no arrivals or departures were allowed for
about 30 minutes. Regular airline traffic resumed about 12:30 p.m.,
DeSoto said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration and
National Transportation Safety Board were at the scene Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Ragogna, an air safety investigator from the NTSB office
in Arlington, Texas, said the investigation would focus on cockpit
instruments, flight controls, signs of whether both engines were
producing power and the aircraft's maintenance record and the
pilot's training record.

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Strike Iowa, Kansas  </HEADLINE>
By GREG SMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNKERTON, Iowa (AP) -- Residents of Iowa and Kansas surveyed
damage Friday from tornadoes that damaged scores of homes and
businesses. A 4-year-old girl died in the aftermath of the storms,
which also left three people injured.
</P>
<P>
   The girl died Friday after a porch roof damaged at her
Tonganoxie, Kan., home collapsed onto her, officials said. The
house was believed to have been damaged by the tornado Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, a 72-year-old woman remained hospitalized after losing
an arm when a tornado struck her house, said Dave Miller of the
state Emergency Management Agency. Two other injuries were
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tom Vilsack toured the area of northeastern Iowa hit by a
dozen tornadoes Thursday night and declared disaster areas in Black
Hawk and Buchanan counties.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's devastation,'' he said. ''I've never seen homes,
farmsteads, farm buildings quite as pulverized as those which we've
seen today.''
</P>

   The temporary trailers that house Dunkerton City Hall and the
post office were knocked off their foundations and were closed
Friday. Both offices were relocated last year because of flooding.

<P>
   ''They told us when they put it up that it was supposed to
withstand 80 mph winds,'' Mayor Richard Ede said. ''I guess if we
have to lose a building or a couple of buildings, at least nobody
was in them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tonganoxie, officials estimated up to 200 homes and a dozen
businesses were damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Roof damage allowed water to seep into eight of 32 classrooms in
Tonganoxie Elementary School, damaging the classrooms and
equipment. Classes were canceled Friday for the 700 students, and
no decision has been made on whether school would be canceled next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Florence Somers' house outside of town sustained only window and
roof damage, but her farm's hay barn and other buildings were
leveled. All that remained of the 45-foot silo was a pile of
concrete blocks and a twisted ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was pretty devastating. We saw a few pieces of hail and
then things started crashing and banging,'' Somers said. ''We were
very fortunate. God was looking after us.''

<HEADLINE> Bishops Meeting in Canada  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey will lead a
meeting of Anglican and Catholic bishops in examining relations
between the churches almost 500 years after they split.
</P>
<P>
   The six-day gathering that begins Sunday will ''review and
evaluate the accomplishment of thirty years of ecumenical dialogue
between the two traditions,'' said a statement from the Anglican
Communion Web site.
</P>
<P>
   It said the talks emerged from the 1996 meeting between Carey
and Pope John Paul II that concluded with a joint declaration that
the two churches should ''consult further'' about their relations.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of England emerged in 1534 when King Henry VIII
rejected papal authority because Pope Clement VIII refused to annul
his marriage so he could remarry.
</P>
<P>
   Carey and Cardinal Edward Idris Cassidy, president of the
Vatican's Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, will
jointly chair the meeting in Toronto, said the Anglican statement.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, considered the main vehicle for dialogue between
the churches, was set up after the 1966 meeting of Anglican
Archbishop Michael Ramsey and Pope Paul VI.
</P>
<P>
   Bishops attending will be from New Zealand, Canada, England, the
United States, Ireland, India, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Southern
Africa, Uganda, Australia, Brazil and the West Indies.

<HEADLINE> Fate of Algerian in US Unclear  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The fate of an exiled Algerian detained by
U.S. immigration officials for more than three years remained
unclear Friday after his lawyer said he'd been granted asylum.
</P>
<P>
   An Immigration and Naturalization Service spokeswoman said she
couldn't comment on the status of Anwar Haddam, former
representative in Washington of Algeria's banned Islamic Salvation
Front.
</P>
<P>
   Haddam's lawyer, Malea Kibaln, said she was notified Thursday by
mail that he was granted asylum May 5 on an application filed by
his wife, Nafimah. But she said that her client remained in jail in
Virginia a week later and that she had been unable to determine
why.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are investigating this issue and we will have more to say
about it at a later date,'' said INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona.
</P>
<P>
   Haddam ran for Algeria's parliament in 1992 and when it became
clear the Islamic Salvation Front was winning the elections, the
army canceled them and banned the party.
</P>
<P>
   The move triggered a bloody Islamic insurgency that has now
killed more than 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Haddam had been living in the Washington area from 1993 until
late 1996, when his visa status was revoked on Dec. 5, 1996. The
next day he was arrested and has been held in several different
detention centers in Virginia, Kibaln said.
</P>
<P>
   Kibaln said Haddam has been held for so long because of the use
of so-called secret evidence against him, meaning classified
information from secret sources that the government does not have
to reveal and that the accused therefore cannot rebut.
</P>
<P>
   The military arm of the Islamic Salvation Front -- the Islamic
Salvation Army -- was one of two main guerrilla groups fighting the
government.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer says Haddam denies any connection to the violence in
Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has never advocated violence and has always advocated a
peaceful resolution to the conflict in Algeria'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Famed Authors Plane Said Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSEILLE, France (AP) -- A company preparing a documentary on
the author of the children's classic ''The Little Prince'' said
Friday they may have found traces of Antoine de Saint-Exupery's
missing warplane -- a finding that could shed light on his
disappearance during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers at a French maritime works company said they had
likely discovered a piece of the writer's Lockheed P-38 Lightning
plane as they probed the Mediterranean in a search for clues off
the coast of Marseille.
</P>
<P>
   Thierry Carlin, an engineer for Geocean Solmarine, said that all
the other P-38s that crashed in the area during World War II had
already been recovered, so the wreckage probably came from the
plane of Saint-Exupery, who vanished during a July 31, 1944 flight
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a strong chance that this left part of the tail comes
from his plane,'' Carlin, who headed the search team, told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Saint-Exupery had taken off from the island of Corsica and was
flying near the French coast on an Allied mission against the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated searches of the coast have failed to turn up the plane,
leaving the author's disappearance shrouded in mystery for 56
years. Theories have ranged from hostile gunfire to mechanical
problems to suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin said his company and another underwater research group,
Comex, discovered the tail piece 132 feet underwater in April
during research for the documentary, to be aired Arte television
channel.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin said the company will check with maritime authorities
before attempting to bring the wreckage to the surface. The
Marseille headquarters of Maritime Affairs was not immediately
available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The tail piece was discovered less than about one mile from the
rocky inlet where a fisherman discovered a bracelet that may have
belonged to the author, Carlin said.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Paper Presses Ahead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- No one's in Los Alamos, but they're going
to get their paper.
</P>
<P>
   Before fire forced evacuation of the town on Wednesday, the Los
Alamos Monitor managed to publish its afternoon edition. The two
dozen staffers scattered, so the paper could not publish its
Thursday and Friday editions.
</P>
<P>
   Help came from The Santa Fe New Mexican, which set up a
makeshift newsroom for the Monitor in its building in Sante Fe,
about 35 miles away. The Monitor planned to insert its own special
section in the Sante Fe newspaper on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're actually part of the story, it's just an enormous
challenge to cover it. It's exhausting,'' said Chris Dissinger,
Monitor general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The staff had taken refuge in Dissinger's home, in nearby White
Rock. But they had to flee that town early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Monitor, which has a circulation of about 5,100, hopes to
get back to the Los Alamos office next week. Landmark Community
Newspapers, the paper's parent publishing company, sent employees
from other Landmark papers to help out.

<HEADLINE> Big Game winner bought ticket with $98 in change from hot dog  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY BARKS HOFFMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- A swimming-pool installer who put down a
$100 bill for a hot dog and 98 lottery tickets stepped forward with
his wife and three children Friday to claim half of the
record-breaking $363 million jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I'd like to start a new job playing golf,'' said Larry
Ross, a 47-year-old occasional lottery player accustomed to working
80 to 100 hours a week in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't had a summer vacation in 13 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's looking to retire, buy a boat, buy a house, and maybe
buy the purple Jaguar his wife has always wanted. He plans to save
some of the money and give some of it to charity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to do anything rash. We're going to invest
wisely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, who spent his hot dog change on Big Game tickets at his
wife's urging, was the first of two mega-winners of Tuesday's
drawing to come forward. He said that when he he stopped at Mr. K's
Party Shoppe to buy a hot dog, all he had was a $100 bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked the guy to give me change in lotto tickets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other winning ticket was sold in Lake Zurich, Ill., 30 miles
northwest of Chicago. That winner has not yet contacted Illinois
lottery officials, a spokeswoman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ross paused at the end of his news conference to wipe away
tears, but otherwise appeared as ''remarkably quite calm'' as
lottery officials said he was when he first called them on
Wednesday. But he says he was anything but calm when he started
calling family members to tell them of the win.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the voice got shriller and the tears got bigger, they
believed me,'' he said of his originally skeptical relatives.
</P>
<P>
   After he saw the winning numbers on television Wednesday
morning, ''I invented a new dance -- I started doing the lottery
dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, ''I haven't slept in three days. It's a great diet
program, win the lotto and lose weight. I haven't eaten in three
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross and his wife, Nancy, 45, have been married 25 years. They
have three children: Ian, 21, Eric, 25, Shannon, 12. All three
attended the news conference, along with Eric's wife, Jamie, and
Ian's fiancee, Katie Niemasz.
</P>
<P>
   The Rosses will take their share of the jackpot in a one-time
lump-sum payment of about $90.3 million before taxes. After the
lottery deducts 28 percent for federal taxes and 4.2 percent in
state income taxes, the Rosses will get about $61.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously we'll have more toys, but we'll be the same
people,'' he said, describing himself as someone who likes to joke
around and laugh.
</P>
<P>
   At Mr. K's Party Shoppe near Utica, 20 miles north of Detroit,
store owner George Kassab and his family cheered as they watched
the news conference on television.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the one, he's the one who called,'' said Melvin Kassab,
the owner's son, who sold the winning ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he and his family hope to be able to weather the media
attention until his daughter, Shannon, finishes seventh grade next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Then his family plans to move from their four-bedroom ranch in
Shelby Township to a more secure neighborhood somewhere in
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have the ecstasy of winning and then you start realizing
the agony of what might happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got security problems now. You think about your family,
who's at risk. We're not in a secure neighborhood. We don't have
security like rich people have.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross, his wife and two of his children came to Lansing on
Wednesday to claim the prize, but neither lottery officials nor the
Rosses were ready to hold a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials confirmed he had the winning ticket, then made
up a symbolic $150,000 check for the family to carry out of the
Lottery Commission so the media wouldn't catch on.
</P>
<P>
   The ploy worked, allowing the Rosses to keep their win a secret
for two more days. The family has already contacted a lawyer and
financial adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he wrote down the winning numbers incorrectly Tuesday
night on the way home and didn't realize one of his Easy Picks was
a winner until Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The drawing pumped $29 million into Michigan's fund for K-12
schools. ''The real winners are the kids in Michigan,'' Michigan
Lottery Commissioner Don Gilmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's drawing capped days of frenzy that sent lottery
veterans and first-timers alike scurrying for $1 chances at the big
dream. By the time it was over, the seven states that jointly offer
the Big Game had sold some 358 million tickets after the previous
jackpot -- $15 million, in the Feb. 11 drawing, was claimed by L.E.
Bird of Warren.
</P>
<P>
   The winning numbers drawn Tuesday were 1, 2, 12, 33, 37 and Big
Money Ball 4. To win, a ticket had to match all six numbers.
</P>
<P>
   There were 72 tickets matching all the numbers except the Big
Money Ball. Each is worth $150,000 before taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The states that participate in the Big Game are Georgia,
Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The jackpot easily topped the previous American record, a $295.7
million Powerball jackpot split two years ago by 13 machinists in
Westerville, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the largest Big Game jackpot was $197 million
awarded solely to Maria Grasso, a 54-year-old Chilean immigrant
living in Massachusetts. She won in the April 6, 1999 drawing.
</P>
<P>
   The world lottery record is $1.2 billion, set in December by
Spain's El Gordo, or the Fat One. But that game awards thousands of
prizes.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Giuliani Marriage Is Private  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A poll out Friday found that eight in 10 New
York voters believe Rudolph Giuliani's marital problems are a
private matter.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven percent said the issue is relevant in the Senate race
against Hillary Rodham Clinton and makes them view the mayor
negatively as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was an indication that in an already close Senate race,
voter dissatisfaction over the New York City mayor's marital
problems and concern about his health could become an important
factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't need a poll to tell you this is going to hurt him,''
said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The latest New York Daily News/New York 1 poll found 81 percent
of New York voters said Giuliani's announcement this week that he
and his wife were discussing a legal separation was a private
matter and had no effect on how they viewed him as a Senate
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the combination of factors -- his treatable
prostate cancer, the separation and his wife's claim that he had a
relationship with a City Hall employee during their marriage --
meant he should get out of the race, 63 percent said he should
continue to run. Seventeen percent said he should pack up his
campaign gear.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday if he found the results heartening, Giuliani said:
''No, this is a very highly personal matter. My focus and concern
are for all the people involved in it. I've never paid an awful lot
of attention to polls.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he had still not made up his mind about staying
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Post/Fox TV poll from the end of April, conducted by
Zogby International just after Giuliani, 55, announced he had
cancer, found 12 percent of voters said the disease meant he was no
longer a strong candidate. Eighty-two percent said he remained a
strong candidate.

<HEADLINE> Shots Fired in Nicaragua Assembly  </HEADLINE>
By FILADELFO ALEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- A congressman accused of bigamy
repeatedly fired a pistol in the National Assembly on Friday and
threatened to kill himself before finally surrendering after a
five-hour standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Marlon Boanerges Castillo, 41, fired at least 14
shots and held the gun to his head as friends and relatives begged
him to stop, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   After about five hours, he fell to his knees and wept as another
congressman read a psalm to calm him. Castillo prayed and turned
the gun over to a priest, said Msgr. Eddy Montenegro, Roman
Catholic vicar-general of Managua, who came to the scene at
Castillo's request.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro told reporters that Castillo admitted the allegations
made last week by his first wife, who said she had only recently
discovered that the congressman was the husband she had thought
died in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has congressional immunity, he was not arrested. It
was not immediately clear where Castillo had gone.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began last week when Maritza del Carmen Sequeira
Morales told reporters that Castillo was actually her husband, Jose
Antonio Alvarez Urbina, whom she married in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   She said the couple had four daughters before Alvarez went off
to fight with the U.S.-backed Contra rebels against the leftist
Sandinista government, which was finally defeated in a 1990
election.
</P>
<P>
   She said she thought he had died in 1984. But a friend
eventually pointed out the congressman. She said she discovered
that he had created a new identity with a false birth certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo at first denied the charges and claimed that Sequeira
was trying to blackmail him.
</P>
<P>
   When she asked congress to remove his immunity this week,
Castillo denied her claims and accused her of trying to blackmail
him.
</P>
<P>
   Visibly weary, Castillo left the legislative chamber supported
by his current wife, Carolina Moreira, and followed by
anti-terrorist police, congressmen and nurses, one of whom carried
a straitjacket.
</P>
<P>
   Congresswoman Angeles Rios said Castillo wanted to kill himself
before journalists to let the world know about his dilemma.

<HEADLINE> Colombia: US Sending Usable Arms  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARITA MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's military chief on Friday
played down reports that the Pentagon gave the Andean country old
and potentially dangerous ammunition for fighting the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't had any incidents, any problems,'' Gen. Fernando
Tapias told The Associated Press. ''The ammunition we have received
is perfectly usable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tapias spoke during a day of meetings in this Caribbean port
between top U.S. and Colombian officials to discuss a proposed $1.7
billion U.S. anti-narcotics aid package being debated on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering met with President
Andres Pastrana, then held a news conference at which he criticized
congressional delays in approving the massive plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm convinced that every day we have to wait represents seven
days in the future to recover the time that has been lost,''
Pickering said, speaking in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether the funds for eradicating coca and opium
crops are approved, Pickering said officials were planning
''interim steps'' to attack drug production in Putumayo, the
southern state where coca is growing the fastest. He did not
provide details on those plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Times reported Thursday that the U.S. State
Department last year sent Colombia 17 million rounds of .50-caliber
ammunition made in 1952, despite a warning from the manufacturer
that the Korean war-era bullets were dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The warning was against using the ammunition in Gatling guns
mounted on U.S.-built Blackhawk helicopters, which are used in
attack roles and to ferry troops into combat with guerrillas or on
drug eradication missions.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. embassy spokesman Robert Schmidt said the October 1999
shipment of Korean War-era ammunition included only 2 million
.50-caliber rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the only type of .50-caliber ammunition the Pentagon
had available at that time,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Pentagon did not inform the State Department of the manufacturer's
warning until May 1, six months after the rounds were shipped to
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombians must fire the older ammunition at a slower rate
than possible with newer ammunition, but it still meets their
requirements, the official said.

<HEADLINE> UN: Keep Politics Out of Elian Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
Sadako Ogata said Friday that politics should be kept out of the
Elian Gonzalez case and indicated she thought the boy belonged with
his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that politics should play a role'' in the case
of the 6-year-old boy at the heart of an international custody
dispute, Ogata said. The child has been at the center of a
tug-of-war between his father in Cuba and his relatives in Miami
since he was rescued off Florida's coast in late November.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fundamental consideration should be in the best interest
of the child,'' Ogata told a news conference as she wound up a
two-day visit to the communist island.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba declared it would continue to fight for the return of Elian
as it awaited the decision of a U.S. appellate court on a request
by the boy's Miami relatives for a political asylum hearing for the
child.
</P>
<P>
   ''Independent of what happens in Atlanta, our people will
continue their battle,'' the Communist Party daily Granma said in a
front page editorial.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials have declined to speculate on how the judges
will rule.
</P>
<P>
   Ogata said that when she met with President Fidel Castro on
Thursday in an effort to persuade him to join other countries
across the hemisphere by signing a long-standing U.N. treaty on
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government ''is seriously considering signing the
protocol... that is precisely one of the reasons why I am here,''
Ogata said.
</P>
<P>
   During a speech at the University of Havana on Thursday, Ogata
praised Cuba for its historical support of refugees from Haiti and
Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cuba has a very important tradition to grant asylum,'' Ogata
told students. In doing so, she said, ''the Cubans have given the
world a powerful message of solidarity and understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of refugees has never been a key political issue here,
with the exception of sporadic waves of Haitians arriving on the
easternmost part of Cuba, near the island of Hispaniola.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Fidel Castro's Communist government often use the
term refugees to describe the thousands of people who leave Cuba
illegally each year by sea.
</P>
<P>
   But both Cuba and the U.S. Coast Guard, which is charged with
repatriating seaborne Cubans to their homeland, describes the
majority of those Cubans as illegal migrants who have left for
economic reasons.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Meets Iraqi Official  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Joining forces to denounce their
common foe, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and Iraq's
foreign minister on Friday issued a joint statement blasting the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's state television quoted Milosevic and Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf Friday as saying the United
States was the leader of ''hegemonism and NATO neocolonialism.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic praised ''friendly relations'' between Yugoslavia and
Iraq. The two officials said that ''Iraq and Yugoslavia are
determined to defend their countries' freedom, sovereignty and
territorial integrity,'' the television report said, quoting a
joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   Both nations were ''confronting the policy of dictate and
power'' and thier stand was ''receiving increasing support in the
world,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has forged alliances with Iraq, Belarus, Cuba and some
African countries since last year, when Serbia lost control of its
southern Kosovo province following NATO's 78-day bombing campaign.

<HEADLINE> Feds: Ecstasy Drug Gains Popularity  </HEADLINE>
By MAY WONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Customs agents intercepted nearly a half
million tablets of ecstasy that arrived on a passenger flight from
Paris, disguised inside cargo boxes that were shrink-wrapped and
labeled as cotton pants.
</P>
<P>
   The bust Monday was one of the largest ecstasy seizures in the
country and reflects a sharp increase in the popularity of the
hallucinogenic drug, said Robert Stiriti, an assistant agent in
charge of the Customs Service's San Francisco office.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the drug of choice of young partygoers today,'' Stiriti
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy, also known as MDMA, usually comes in a small powdery
pill. It is popular at nightclubs and sells for about $45 per
tablet.
</P>
<P>
   The 490,000 tablets confiscated from a United Airlines flight at
San Francisco International Airport top the 400,000 tablets seized
nationwide in 1997 and push this year's total to 5.2 million pills,
compared with 3.5 million seized all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure was the result of a yearlong sting operation and led
to the arrest of Ben Wizmann, 41, at his Los Angeles home. He
allegedly paid a federal informant $9,000 to smuggle three
100-pound packages past Customs officials at the San Francisco
airport.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged with conspiracy, smuggling and other charges and
held without bail. It was unclear whether he had an attorney who
could comment.
</P>
<P>
   More arrests are expected.

<HEADLINE> Nine Dead in Colombia Massacre  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Suspected rightist paramilitary gunmen
barged into a seaside village early Friday and killed nine people
they accused of being rebel informants, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A group of about 80 armed men carried out the attack in a town
on the outskirts of Buenaventura, a bustling Pacific seaport 215
miles west of the capital, Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the assassins left spray-painted slogans indicating
they were members of a ''self-defense'' group, the term Colombia's
rightist militias use to describe themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's national paramilitary umbrella organization claimed
in a communique that 12 people were executed in Friday's raid.
Police put the figure at nine.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by landowners and drug traffickers seeking protection
against extortion and kidnappings by leftist guerrillas, Colombia's
paramilitary groups have killed thousands of people in a
scorched-earth war against suspected leftists.
</P>
<P>
   The militias have made repeated inroads into areas previously
held by the rebels, often marking the incursions with massacres.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Mulls Stake in Coyotes  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Could the Great One remake a not-so-great team in
his image? Phoenix hockey fans might be about to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky, who retired last year planning to spend two years
away from hockey, is considering becoming part owner of the Phoenix
Coyotes along with prospective lead investor Steve Ellman.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely the right offer. It's just a question if it's
the right time,'' Gretzky told The Arizona Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky's home phone number is unlisted, and Michael Barnett,
his agent, did not immediately return phone calls to his office
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been discussions,'' said Jeffrey Hecht, a spokesman
for Ellman. ''We're hopeful that we can reach that agreement.
Obviously, bringing Wayne Gretzky aboard would be wonderful for the
Coyotes and their fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Hecht declined to discuss the timetable for reaching an
agreement with the Hall of Fame forward, but said it could take
place quickly. The NHL Board of Governors will meet to approve the
sale on June 20, and the ownership package must be finalized in
advance of that date.
</P>
<P>
   Ellman, the principal of a company building an arena for the
Coyotes in a Scottsdale mall, earned his fortune in real estate and
has no background in sports ownership.
</P>
<P>
   He has been looking for investors to help him buy the team from
Richard Burke for $87 million, and Gretzky, the biggest star in
hockey history, appears to be an ideal partner.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky holds most NHL scoring records, and the league retired
his No. 99 in Toronto during the All-Star week in February.
</P>
<P>
   ''His name is magic in hockey,'' NHL spokesman Frank Brown said.
''If this is something that Wayne wants, it would be delightful to
see it come to fruition. But there's a significant difference
between discussions and the consummation of a deal, so any reaction
from us would be purely speculative.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes have had big names before.
</P>
<P>
   The Winnipeg Jets broke into the World Hockey Association with
Bobby Hull as their star. But since the franchise joined the NHL in
1979, the Jets-Coyotes have made the playoffs 14 times and been
eliminated in the first round 12 times -- the last nine in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Burke bought the Jets in 1995 with Steve Gluckstern for $65
million and moved the franchise to Phoenix in 1996, buying out
Gluckstern two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Ellman's first payment to Burke reportedly is set for Wednesday
-- a $10 million cash transfer, with an additional $17 million due
by June 30. The remaining $60 million would be financed by transfer
of French bank Societe Generale's loan from Burke to Ellman.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale has an interest in the sale because the $170 million,
18,000-seat arena is the centerpiece of a $535 redevelopment the
city believes will rejuvenate a deteriorating neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Coyotes hockey team is viewed as the key anchor tenant for
this project, and anything that strengthens and stabilizes the
organization is a major positive,'' city redevelopment director
Gary Roe said. ''Mr. Gretzky is synonymous with hockey, and his
reputation, his credentials are obviously of tremendous appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   He said adding Gretzky to the ownership mix would be consistent
with Ellman's approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Ellman Cos. have shown a pattern of trying to bring in the
best expertise they can,'' Roe said.
</P>
<P>
   Demolition is under way at the site of the new arena, but the
city is waiting for Ellman Cos. to revise the site plan before
committing to spend $352 million in public money on the project.

<HEADLINE> Israel Justifies Nuclear Decision  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
justified Israel's refusal to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty on Friday, saying Iraq and Iran posed too great a threat to
be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a fact that the technology purchased by Iran is intended
in order to develop weapons of mass destruction and long range
missiles,'' Levy said, adding that some of the missiles could reach
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking to reporters as a monthlong conference reviewing
the treaty wrapped up its third week of work. Israel has come under
fire at the conference for being the only country in the Middle
East that hasn't signed the treaty or allowed its nuclear
facilities to be inspected by the International Atomic Energy
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its nuclear capability
and has said it wants to work out issues of nuclear disarmament
regionally.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not reached a state of tranquility and calmness that
we can say the friends of Israel can guarantee the future,'' he
said, citing Iraq's nuclear capabilities as well as Iran's.

New Mexico Fire Still Rages
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- A Los Alamos wildfire remained out of control today
in the nearby forests and canyons today and residents were told they could not
return to their houses for at least a week. Blowtorch winds and searing heat
that fed the fire eased. The fire, which began with a government-prescribed burn
to clear brush, damaged the town's nuclear weapons laboratory and forced 25,000
people to flee. The weapon lab appeared out of danger, and all of the facility's
major buildings were unscathed, said Richard Burick, deputy lab director for
operations.

years of fighting. One of the most striking examples of the positive reaction by
the war-weary people to the first ray of hope in the territory came from a rebel
stronghold south of the capital, Banda Aceh. There, dozens of young, heavily
armed guerrilla fighters put down their weapons and gave thanks as they heard
news that their leaders and Indonesia's reformist government had signed the
landmark accord and would begin the three-month cease-fire on June 2.

<HEADLINE> Actors Unions File Complaint  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two striking actors unions filed an unfair
labor practice complaint against advertisers Friday, claiming they
are refusing to bargain over pay for work in commercials shown on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The ad industry is failing to bargain in good faith with the
Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and
Radio Artists, the unions said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   They filed their allegation against the joint policy committee
of two industry trade groups, the Association of National
Advertisers and the American Association of Advertising Agencies.
</P>
<P>
   A call seeking comment from attorneys representing the committee
was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The National Labor Relations Board already received an unfair
labor practice filing from the ad industry, which claimed the
unions are threatening to ban actors who cross picket lines from
union membership. The unions called the filing groundless.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the strike that began May 1 is the pay structure for
commercials. Actors get a minimum of about $478 for a day's work
and also get ''pay-per-play'' residuals of roughly $50 to $120 each
time a spot airs on network television.
</P>
<P>
   For cable television commercials, performers receive only a flat
fee of $1,000 or less for each 13-week, unlimited run.
</P>
<P>
   With two-thirds of all TV ads now being made for cable, actors
are demanding that pay-per-play be extended to cable. But
advertisers want to extend the flat fee from cable to the networks.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, Eritrea Fighting Again  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Ignoring international pleas to end
their two-year border conflict, Ethiopia and Eritrea returned to
open war on Friday with fighting reported on three fronts.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan predicted ''a very brutal
war,'' and expressed frustration that peace efforts had failed.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides issued contradictory statements on the details of
the fighting, but both agreed that war had erupted once again along
the 620-mile frontier, which contains a now-evacuated stretch of
fertile land of great value in this drought-wracked region of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council on Friday demanded the two countries
immediately stop fighting and hinted at a possible arms embargo if
Africa's newest war doesn't dissipate over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In a resolution unanimously adopted just hours after fighting
along the Eritrean-Ethiopian border resumed, the council demanded
the Horn of Africa neighbors re-start stalled peace talks that
broke down last week.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution said the council would meet again on Monday ''to
take immediate steps to ensure compliance with this resolution'' if
fighting continues.
</P>
<P>
   A resumption in the two-year war had been rumored in both
capitals, Addis Ababa and Asmara, for days, even as Richard
Holbrooke, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and six other
Security Council representatives urged leaders of both countries
not to return to a ''senseless'' war.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Friday in Munich, Germany, Holbrooke accused Ethiopia
and Eritrea -- two of the world's poorest countries -- of
''stupidity'' for whipping up relatively minor disputes out of
national pride and of ''cruel disregard for the interests of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said there was little hope of stopping a devastating
war between the two countries. Tens of thousands of people could be
killed within days if full-scale conflict breaks out as it did last
year, Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope to bring the parties back to the negotiating table,
but the hope to avoid war is very small,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said millions of people were threatened with famine in
southern Ethiopia because the government is spending its meager
resources on the war.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea blamed its much larger neighbor for initiating Friday's
clashes. For its part, Ethiopia, which has accused Eritrea of
starting previous military conflicts, did not say who started the
latest round.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia said its forces -- supported by tanks, artillery and
aircraft -- made major gains, bombing ''strategic military targets''
inside Eritrea and capturing enemy troops and weapons. Government
spokeswoman Salome Tadesse said the Eritreans suffered heavy
losses.
</P>
<P>
   In Eritrea, however, an adviser to Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki, told The Associated Press by telephone that the claims
were ''a lot of rubbish'' and denied there had been any bombing.
The adviser, Yemane Gebremeskel, said the Ethiopians had been
''unable to advance an inch.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting was centered along three fronts shared by the two
poverty-stricken countries -- Badme, Zalambessa, and Bure.
</P>
<P>
   Badme, a barren stretch of land where the war erupted in May
1998, is 400 miles north of Addis Ababa. Ethiopia retook it in
February 1999 in a battle that may have cost the lives of more than
10,000 soldiers. Zalambessa, in Eritrean hands, is a valuable
fertile area about 250 miles north of Addis Ababa, and Bure is a
border crossing 50 miles west of Eritrea's Red Sea port of Assab.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council was reported to be focusing on condemning
the renewal of fighting and looking for ways to pressure both sides
to agree to peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a
30-year guerrilla war. Ethiopia's estimated population is 61.7
million; Eritrea's is 4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The recent crisis began two years ago when Eritrea occupied
Badme, in an area known as the Yirga triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Isaias and Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi were comrades
in the fight to oust dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991. Two
years later, when Eritrea became a separate country, they failed to
mark the border officially.
</P>
<P>
   A framework agreement fashioned by the Organization of African
Unity was accepted immediately by Ethiopia in December 1998.
Eritrea accepted it in February 1999 after suffering serious
setbacks when Ethiopia retook Badme.
</P>
<P>
   But final implementation of the agreement stalled over timing of
a cease-fire. Ethiopia wanted to wait until other problems were
worked out, but Eritrea wanted it as a prior condition.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats in both capitals have spoken over the past week of a
probable resumption of fighting. Those in Ethiopia say the Meles
government is facing a serious economic crisis and believed it
could not afford to wait until a peace agreement was implemented,
preferring to launch one final attack to end the war.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia is scheduled to hold elections Sunday, only the second
in its turbulent history as Africa's oldest independent nation.
Discussion of the border conflict scarcely figured in the
pre-electoral debates that were carried on state-run radio and
television.

<HEADLINE> UPM Withdraws Champion Offer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- European paper giant UPM-Kymmene withdrew
its offer for Champion International late Friday, saying it could
not beat a rival offer from International Paper. Hours later,
International Paper and Champion announced their $7.3 billion
merger agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for International to buy Champion for $75 per
share in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   Champion officials said the company signed the merger agreement
with International after its board of directors meeting Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have met the objectives of our shareholders and during the
coming weeks we will be working hard to make the intergration of
Champion into International Paper one that will be good for our
customers and our employees,'' said Richard Olson, Champion
chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Champion said it expects the merger to be completed by mid-year.
</P>
<P>
   UPM, of Finland, had reached a merger deal with Champion in
February. But International Paper made a surprise offer two weeks
ago with a cash-and-stock bid of $64 a share. The company increased
its offer Wednesday to $75 a share and raised the cash portion of
the offer from $43 to $50.
</P>
<P>
   UPM's all-stock offer was originally worth $6.6 billion but
later fell to $5 billion because of a decline in UPM's shares.
Earlier this week, UPM also upped its offer to $70 per share in
cash.
</P>
<P>
   The total value of International Paper's offer was still richer
at $7.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   UPM had until Friday to make another offer. But in a statement
released late Friday, UPM said its board of directors had decided
not to make a new offer for Stamford-based Champion.
</P>
<P>
   ''After International Paper's unsolicited offer it has become
clear that the merger of Champion International and UPM-Kymmene
cannot be carried out at a price level acceptable to UPM-Kymmene
shareholders,'' said Juha Niemela, UPM's president and chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Champion has about $2.3 billion in debt that would be taken on
by the company that acquires it.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding war for Champion came shortly after another large
merger in the global paper industry. Just five days after UPM's
merger accord with Champion was announced in February, the
Finnish-Swedish forest products company Stora Enso announced a deal
to acquire Consolidated Papers Inc. of Wisconsin for about $4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   International Paper is the world's largest paper maker with
$24.6 billion in revenues and 99,000 employees. Champion has $5.3
billion in revenues and 18,000 employees. UPM has $9.7 billion and
32,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   UPM withdrew after the close of stock trading Friday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Ripken Sidelined By Aching Back  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken has again been sidelined by back
pain, leaving open the possibility that baseball's Iron Man might
be on his way toward another stint on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken was held out of the Baltimore Orioles' lineup Friday
night, and manager Mike Hargrove said it's possible that the third
baseman will remain on the bench through the weekend. If the pain
stretches beyond that, then the disabled list is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we get to 7-10 days, I would imagine we'd look where we're
at and try to make a decision,'' Hargrove said.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken played in a record 2,632 games before voluntarily ending
the streak in September 1998. Last year he made his first two trips
to the disabled list, both because of lower back pain, and
underwent back surgery during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   The aftereffects of the operation, in addition to the wear and
tear of playing baseball, proved to be too much to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have nerve irritation caused by scarring tissue, along with
too many dives and missing the ball,'' Ripken said, forcing a grin.
''It's gotten increasingly worse. I guess I'll shut it down for a
few days, let the inflammation die down and go at it again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I should expect a few bumps in the road. The strategy
now is to rest and take some medication.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Ripken played without fail. Along the way, he
overcame more than one sprained ankle, the flu and a host of bumps
and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole process is discouraging. I played my whole career
with nicks and nagging injuries,'' he said. ''This is different.
... If it keeps going in this direction, something worse can
happen. I don't know what, but pain is usually a guideline that
something is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken began to feel increasingly uncomfortable last weekend and
was used twice as a designated hitter, on Tuesday and Wednesday, in
Toronto. It was the first time in his career he played DH.
</P>
<P>
   He was at third base and hit a 370-foot homer Thursday night
against Boston, but left the game well before the final out of the
Orioles' 11-4 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the fifth or sixth inning, it got as intense as it's
been,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All he can do now is take his medicine and try to relax.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know exactly how it's going to play out,'' Ripken
said. ''I'm pretty satisfied that a few days rest and medication
will take effect.''

<HEADLINE> Izzo To Make Decision on Hawks Job  </HEADLINE>
By AMY FRANKLIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Coach Tom Izzo of NCAA champion
Michigan State will decide by Saturday whether he will take the
Atlanta Hawks' NBA coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks reportedly have offered Izzo a five-year contract
worth more than $15 million if he takes the job left vacant by
Lenny Wilkens.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't lie,'' Izzo said of the amount of the offer. ''That
was a little mind-boggling to me. That piqued my interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State spokesman John Lewandowski has said Izzo, who
guided the Spartans to the NCAA championship last season, received
permission from school president Peter McPherson to talk with the
Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has been searching for a new coach since Wilkens
resigned under pressure April 24.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo returned Friday from a Caribbean vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo said he was afraid people were ''starting to think I was
running and hiding.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had a two-hour meeting with the Hawks last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sitting here right now, not knowing what I'm going to
do,'' Izzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens, the winningest coach in NBA history, resigned after
seven seasons with the Hawks. The team missed the playoffs for the
first time in eight years and struggled to its worst record (28-54)
since moving to Atlanta in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo has a 120-48 record in five seasons as head coach,
including three straight Big Ten titles and consecutive appearances
in the Final Four. The 45-year-old coach, making about $850,000 a
year, recently agreed to a new five-year, rollover contract that
would be worth $1.1 million annually, plus bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo has been at Michigan State for 17 years, having worked
previously as an assistant for Jud Heathcote.
</P>
<P>
   Only one college coach has won an NCAA title and left the next
season for the NBA. Larry Brown moved to San Antonio in 1988 after
leading Kansas to a championship.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, college coaches such as Rick Pitino, P.J.
Carlesimo and John Calipari have struggled after jumping to the
NBA.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 4, Blue Jays 3  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Gerald Williams snapped an
eighth-inning tie with a RBI single and scored on Miguel Cairo's
triple as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays beat the Toronto Blue Jays 4-3
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay won despite committing a team-record five errors --
three by shortstop Kevin Stocker -- which led to two unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays beat right-hander Cris Carpenter (3-4) for the
first time after losing to him four times in the last two seasons.
Rick White (1-2) pitched two innings of relief to get the win, and
Albie Lopez worked the ninth for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays scored an unearned run off Bryan Rekar in the
first when second baseman Cairo mishandled a cutoff throw from
right field.
</P>
<P>
   They added another in the seventh off White, tying the game at
2, when Stocker was charged with a double error for booting Homer
Bush's two-out grounder and then throwing wildly past Cairo at
second.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Gonzalez hit a solo homer off Lopez in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter was 4-0 with an 0.34 ERA against Tampa Bay with three
complete games and two shutouts the past two seasons, and the Devil
Rays had to scrap for everything they got against the right-hander
again this time.
</P>
<P>
   Williams singled, moved to second when Cairo was hit by a pitch
and stole third before scoring when Greg Vaughn grounded into a
double play in the first. Carpenter yielded a single to Vinny
Castilla in the second, then retired 11 in a row before Stocker led
off the sixth with a single.
</P>
<P>
   Williams moved Stocker up with a slow grounder to first and
Cairo followed with the RBI single that enabled Rekar to leave the
game with a chance to get his first victory since last July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto wasted several opportunities against Rekar, going
1-for-8 with runners in scoring position in the first six innings.
The Tampa Bay starter twice worked out of jams after the Blue Jays
got a runner to second base with no outs.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: Jose Canseco is 0-for-13 with seven strikeouts lifetime
against Carpenter. ... Tampa Bay's Fred McGriff singled in the
seventh to extend his hitting streak to 13 games, one shy of his
career best ... Delgado extended his streak to nine for Toronto,
while teammate Darrin Fletcher has hit in eight straight. ... Steve
Trachsel has won his last two starts 1-0 for Tampa Bay, the first
time a pitcher has done that in the AL since Bert Blyleven in June
1976 with Texas. The last NL pitcher to do it was Pittsburgh's Zane
Smith in July 1992. Trachsel beat Pedro Martinez at Fenway Park and
Orlando Hernandez at Yankee Stadium. The last pitcher to win
consecutive 1-0 decisions on the road was Tim Leary of the Dodgers
in 1988.

<HEADLINE> UN: Remember Congo's Trouble, Too  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The peacekeeping crisis in Sierra Leone
should not cloud the international community's responsibility to
help restore peace in the Congo, a U.N. Security Council delegation
that traveled to the region warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the full 15-member council, the delegation headed
by U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said Congo's renewed
cease-fire -- though fragile -- ''is an important basis for future
peacemaking and must not be given up lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands' U.N. Ambassador Peter Van Walsum, who presented
the report, said the delegation came back from the continent with
''a positive impression'' of the current stage of implementation of
the cease-fire agreement signed last summer by the government and
rebel forces and their backers in Lusaka, Zambia and reaffirmed
April 14.
</P>
<P>
   Van Walsum delivered the report on the day that Ethiopia and
Eritrea renewed their two-year-old border conflict, and some 500
U.N. peacekeepers remained hostage to rebel forces in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Developments in Sierra Leone ''inevitably cast a shadow'' over
the Congo mission but ''should not be allowed to cloud the
international community's responsibility in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo and its capacity to make a real difference there,''
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Walsum called on council members to fight the negative
effects of the conflicts Sierra Leone and Ethiopia-Eritrea and
judge Congo on its own merits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our problem is how do we sell this information to an
international public ... that feels that Africa is falling apart,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-member council delegation visited the Congo and
neighboring countries which are signatories to last summer's
agreement to assess prospects for its implementation and the
deployment of a planned 5,537-member U.N. observer mission.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. mission, which would include 3,700 fighting troops and
500 monitors, is part of the peace process to end the 22-month
civil war in which five foreign armies are entangled.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan must decide whether security
conditions are sufficient for the troops to do their job before
giving green light for deployment.

New Mexico Fire Still Rages
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- A Los Alamos wildfire that began as a
government-prescribed burn to clear brush remained out of control today in the
nearby forests and canyons. Residents were told they could not return to their
houses for at least a week as blowtorch winds and searing heat that fed the fire
eased. The fire forced 25,000 people to flee their homes and also damaged the
town's nuclear weapons laboratory. The weapon lab appeared out of danger, and
all of the facility's major buildings were unscathed, said Richard Burick,
deputy lab director for operations.

Ethiopia, Eritrea Fighting Again
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Ignoring international pleas to end their
two-year border conflict, Ethiopia and Eritrea returned to open war on Friday
with fighting reported on three fronts. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
predicted ''a very brutal war,'' and expressed frustration that peace efforts
had failed. The two sides issued contradictory statements on the details of the
fighting, but both agreed that war had erupted once again along the 620-mile
frontier, which contains a now-evacuated stretch of fertile land of great value
in this drought-wracked region of Africa. The U.N. Security Council demanded the
two countries immediately stop fighting and hinted at a possible arms embargo if
Africa's newest war doesn't dissipate over the weekend.

dozens of young, heavily armed guerrilla fighters put down their weapons and
gave thanks as they heard news that their leaders and Indonesia's reformist
government had signed the landmark accord and would begin the three-month

his early years in Congress, but they have parted ways. Bush and Gore sat down
for interviews on morning television shows, raising their voices on one of the
most volatile issues of the presidential campaign season. Recent polls show
voters split between Gore and Bush on whom they trust on gun policies.

Maine Negotiates Drug Prices

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Maine is the first state to decide to use its bargaining
power to negotiate prices of prescription medicine for people without coverage.
Tired of waiting for Congress to act, many states are closely watching Maine's

is also threatening to become the first state to enact price controls on

Germany must not be afraid to think about controlling immigration if that would

<TEXT>
<P>
   QUEBEC (AP) -- Federal Tories began to stake their ground as a
fiscally conservative party with a heart Friday, putting in the
first planks of a policy platform that includes eliminating the
personal capital gains tax and a fixed schedule to reduce the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates at the four-day policy convention also approved a
motion that would increase the basic personal exemption on income
tax to $12,000 from the current $7,131 within two years.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tory rank and file grappled with how far they should go
on the economic front, debating the impact that policies would have
on poorer Canadians and social programs.
</P>
<P>
   They rejected a motion for a single flat income tax, similar to
the one their political rivals in the Canadian Alliance have
adopted.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance is a constant consideration at the Tory gathering,
given that it has attracted a number of high-profile Conservatives
to its ranks with the promise of tough fiscal measures and a shot
at forming government.
Alberta Man Wants Charges Against Tax Agents
</P>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- An Alberta man says Revenue Canada
harassed his wife so much she committed suicide and he wants
criminal charges laid against two tax agents.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stephan, 47, of Cardston, Alberta, has been in a battle
over back taxes with the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency,
formerly known as Revenue Canada, for the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
   When Debora Stephan, 40, killed herself in January 1994, the
mother of 10 left a note for her husband instructing him to use her
life insurance money to pay more than $27,000 in back taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Stephan, along with his new wife and their children, held a
small rally in front of the federal building in Calgary on Friday
to draw attention to their plight.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Alliance MP Jason Kenney renewed his call for a
taxpayers' bill of rights that would include an ombudsManitoba
</P>
<P>
   He wants charges laid against two Revenue Canada agents,
alleging a breach of trust. He alleges the agents did not follow a
department manual that outlines how to deal with people in hardship
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Stephan had filed a lawsuit against the federal department but
no longer wants to go that route.
Critics Slam Officials After Killers Moved to Same Jail
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Political pressure won't change Ottawa's decision
to imprison together the lesbian lovers who fatally stabbed a
Toronto police officer in 1998, says Correctional Services Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Cece, 41, and Mary Barbara Taylor, 31, were transferred
to the Joliette prison for women in Quebec last month after being
convicted in November 1999 in the stabbing death of Det.-Const.
William Hancox.
</P>
<P>
   They were moved to the medium-security facility -- often referred
to as ''Club Fed'' -- after a careful assessment of possible
rehabilitation and the risk they might pose to other inmates and
staff, corrections spokesman Jacques Belanger said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Political considerations or public opinion are never a factor in
such decisions, he added.
</P>
<P>
   David O'Connor, the lawyer who defended Taylor at trial, said
Friday the two inmates were not being housed in the same unit.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime victims' rights advocate Priscilla DeVilliers said
Friday it's wrong to incarcerate together two people whose crime
was clearly a mutual act.
Toronto Police Dog on Lam in Minnesota
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- A valuable Canadian police dog who once sniffed
out criminals in downtown Toronto is now himself on the lam in
rural Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy, a street-smart Belgian Malinois who was in the U.S.
training to find bombs and bodies, escaped from his owner's truck
last weekend near Backus, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several sightings of Rudy in the woodsy U.S.
countryside, but trainer Joe Jasicki has as yet been unable to
apprehend the prized canine, estimated to be worth $20,000 US.
</P>
<P>
   So impressed was Jasicki with Rudy's talents, he was preparing
to sell the dog for a handsome price next week at a U.S. police
conference in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   But only if the canny canine turns himself in.

<HEADLINE> Associate editor fired over fabricated letters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) -- An editorial page editor was fired Friday
after admitting he made up letters to the editor that appeared in
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Donna M. Donovan, president and publisher of the Gannett-owned
Utica Observer-Dispatch, said that an internal investigation by the
newspaper found that 11 letters in last Sunday's newspaper -- all
commenting on a column written by Russ Davis -- were fabricated by
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan said that Davis, who worked at the paper 20 years, also
admitted to making up several other letters that had appeared in
the approximately 50,000-daily and 60,000-Sunday circulation paper
during the past three months. He said he did not remember the
specifics, Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a standard practice for confirming letters to the
editor before they are published,'' said Donovan. ''Because Russ
Davis oversaw the page and also was the person who produced it, he
was able to circumvent that process without detection.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan said she and others became suspicious when so many
letters on Davis' column regarding Vietnam appeared in last
Sunday's Observer-Dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were unable to confirm 11 people listed as letter
writers,'' Donovan said. ''After we called this to Russ' attention,
he admitted that he had created the letters to give the appearance
of high interest in his column. For this serious violation of
journalistic principles, we terminated Russ' employment.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Donovan, Davis said he made up letters that
appeared May 7 and were attributed to: William George, Utica; Peter
Murphy, Rome; Ronald Randolph, Utica; George Hawkins, Utica; Don
Barber, Utica; Rick Jackson, Rome; Kelly McDonough, Clinton; Jack
Potter, New Hartford; Norman Roberts, Utica; Gabe Richfield, Utica,
and Vivian Benning, Utica.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Gannett Newspaper Division and Observer-Dispatch
Principles of Ethical Conduct for Newsrooms, such practices are
prohibited. ''We are seeking to build trust with our readers. Such
activities cannot be allowed, and won't be,'' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wolber, Davis' lawyer, said his client ''felt very badly''
about the incident and was still looking into the specific
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''In terms of whatever may have been done, Mr. Davis feels very
badly,'' Wolber said. ''But there was definitely no one harmed by
anything that he did -- no malice to anyone, no harm to anyone.''

reaction Friday night and barely preserved the Atlanta Braves' 8-7
win over the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves rallied for two runs in the ninth, set up by
shortstop Desi Relaford's two-out error. Pinch-hitter Andres
Galarraga then tied it with a double and rookie Rafael Furcal
followed with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   That left it up to Rocker, and he ran in from the bullpen as
nearly the entire crowd of 21,922 stood. Both the boos and cheers
were loud -- a heavy security presence, including major league
officials down from New York, watched the fans the whole way.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker hung on to earn his eighth save in nine chances. He
worked around two walks and retired Scott Rolen, who earlier hit a
grand slam, on a routine fly ball to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker had previously pitched in Los Angeles, San Diego and
Florida since returning his two-week penalty for insensitive
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Before this game, he was the most popular player at Veterans
Stadium, signing autographs and tossing a couple of balls into the
stands. He heard only positive remarks at that time, and was the
last player to leave the field after warmups.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Ligtenberg (1-1) was the winner and Wayne Gomes (1-4) took
the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Rolen, a notoriously bad hitter with the bases loaded, connected
for a grand slam that capped a six-run rally in the seventh that
put the Phillies ahead 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan hit two home runs and Andruw Jones added a solo
shot for the Braves. Pitcher Terry Mulholland had a career-high
three hits, two of them off Curt Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like it would be an easy night for the Braves as they
took a 6-1 lead into the bottom of the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Jordan led off with a double and moved up on a passed
ball. Brian Hunter, waived by Atlanta last month and playing in
place of the injured Rico Brogna, drove in the run with a grounder.
</P>
<P>
   After a single by Desi Relaford, Rudy Seanez relieved and
singles by pinch-hitter Mickey Morandini and Doug Glanville loaded
the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gant struck out and a walk to Bobby Abreu made it 6-3. Rolen
then hit the first pitch over the right-center field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Rolen was only 8-for-46 (.174) lifetime with the bases loaded
until that drive. He had started out his career 0-for-18 in those
situations, though he hit a grand slam last season against Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, who shut out the Braves on 11 hits last Saturday,
struggled from the start. He gave up a home run to Jones in the
first and Jordan in the second, and was pulled after the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland, who left last Sunday's start because of a bronchial
spasm, pitched 6 1-3 innings. He began the game as a career .107
hitter with 19 RBIs, and went 3-for-3 with two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Brogna, hit in the left forearm by Montreal rookie Matt
Blank on Wednesday night, underwent surgery in the morning. The
Phillies first baseman is expected to miss 10-12 weeks. ... Wally
Joyner started at first base for the Braves in place of Galarraga,
who is 4-for-40 with 19 strikeouts lifetime against Schilling.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Leader Supporting Rwanda  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi on Friday
pledged his support for Rwanda in an escalating crisis with its
ally Uganda, whose troops have clashed with the Rwandan army in
northern Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Moi's one-day visit, the first in more than a decade, marks a
turnabout in Kenya's relations with Rwanda, which had been
estranged since the 1994 genocide of more than 500,000 people on
orders of the former Hutu extremist government that had enjoyed
support of Moi.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan President Paul Kagame, a former leader of the Tutsi-led
rebels who in July 1994 won power and stopped the genocide, said
the situation in the northern Congolese city of Kisangani, which is
divided between Rwandan and Ugandan troops, was for the moment
quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan soldiers clashed with Ugandan forces in Kisangani last
week and again on Tuesday, leaving at least 28 civilians and 15
soldiers dead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.N. military observers already in Kisangani, said
British Col. James Baxter, head of the U.N. military observer team
already in Congo, landed there Friday on a mission to meet with
both the armies that had pledged to withdraw from the city and hand
it over to members of the 5,537-strong U.N. force that is supposed
to deploy in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Both armies are in Congo in support of the rebels opposed to
Congolese President Laurent Kabila. But the lack of common strategy
and support for rival rebel factions led to fighting in Kisangani
last August and again last week.
</P>
<P>
   Kagame said that Ugandan forces had massed troops on their
common border, something he said he hoped to discuss with Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni when they meet on Sunday in the Tanzanian
town of Mwanza on Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't consider Ugandans as our enemies,'' Kagame told
reporters. ''Given the history between the two countries ... the
good relations are important. We shall continue to seek
solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagame said that Moi's visit will add weight to regional efforts
to resolve the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Landlocked Rwanda and Uganda are both dependent on Kenya's
Indian Ocean port of Mombasa through which they receive most of
their imports and particularly war materiel.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 9, Yankees 7  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Dean Palmer homered and Juan Encarnacion had
three RBIs in Detroit's 9-7 victory over the New York Yankees on
Friday night as the Tigers avoided tying the worst start in
franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, who have the worst record in the major leagues,
improved to 10-23. Only one Detroit team has started the season
9-24, the 1953 club that finished 60-94 and 40{ games behind Casey
Stengel's Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens (3-3), bidding for his 251st career win, got off
to a shaky start by walking two and allowing a bunt single in the
first inning even though the Tigers failed to score.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens gave up six runs and 10 hits in 4 2-3 innings for the
Yankees, whose two-game losing streak matches their longest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   C.J. Nitkowski (2-6), who had lost four straight decisions, gave
up two runs and six hits in 5 1-3 innings for Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Brocail allowed a two-run homer to Paul O'Neill with two
outs in the ninth inning. Todd Jones came in and allowed a triple
to Bernie Williams before getting Jorge Posada to fly out to deep
left field to end the game. It was Jones' eighth save.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, shut out six times this season, took a 1-0 lead on
an RBI double by Juan Gonzalez in the third.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the ninth RBI for Gonzalez, who had driven in just
four in the past four weeks. The two-time AL MVP, who is booed each
time he strikes out or flies out at Comerica Park, drove in 128
runs last season for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers jumped on the struggling Clemens for four runs on
four hits and two walks while batting around in the fourth. Deivi
Cruz had an RBI single, Clemens walked Rich Becker with the bases
loaded and Encarnacion's two-run single made it 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees made it 5-2 in the fifth on a two-run single by Jim
Leyritz.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer made it 6-2 with an opposite-field homer to right on the
first pitch to lead off the bottom of the fifth. Two outs later,
Cruz tripled and Luis Polonia walked to knock out Clemens, whose
quest to match Hall of Famer Bob Gibson at 38th on the career wins
list was delayed at least one start.
</P>
<P>
   Polonia had an RBI single and Encarnacion an RBI grounder as the
Tigers made it 8-2 in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Posada had an RBI single and Tino Martinez a two-run double in
the eighth to make it 8-5. Cruz had an RBI single in the Detroit
eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: Scott Brosius hit second in the Yankees order in place of
injured Derek Jeter, who sat out with an abdominal strain on his
left side. Clay Bellinger replaced Jeter at shortstop and was
ninth. ... Rich Becker, making his first start since being signed
Wednesday by the Tigers, started in place of LF Bobby Higginson who
was serving the second of his five-game suspension for the brawl in
Chicago. Becker hit second. ... Yankees Hall of Famer Yogi Berra
turned 75 Friday. ... Fick was involved in two odd plays in
Detroit's second. He reached when Yankees 2B Chuck Knoblauch
fielded the grounder, then threw it in the dirt wide of first for
his third error of the season. Moments later, Fick was ruled out
trying to steal second -- completing a double play -- because Macias
was called for interfering with Posada on his throw to second. ...
The Tigers announced 33,326 tickets sold, their second-largest
crowd of the season.

<HEADLINE> Expos 8, Cubs 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Lee Stevens homered for Montreal and Sammy Sosa
made a critical three-base error in the Expos' 8-3 victory over the
Chicago Cubs on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rondell White's bases-loaded single to the right-field corner in
the fourth inning rolled past Sosa for an error, allowing all four
runners to score to make it 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Thurman (1-0) gave up one run and five hits in 5 1-3
innings in his first start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Wood (1-2) allowed seven runs -- five earned -- on six hits,
struck out six and walked four. Wood made his first start against
Montreal since his major league debut for Chicago at Olympic
Stadium on April 12, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Dustin Hermanson, moved to the bullpen to replace injured closer
Ugueth Urbina, entered with runners on first and second in the
eighth and got the last four outs for his first major league save.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' towering shot over the right-field wall came off Wood
in the second to give the Expos a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos scored two more in the bottom half of the third on
Peter Bergeron's RBI triple, and Jose Vidro's sacrifice fly to make
it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs manager Don Baylor was ejected by home plate umpire Derryl
Cousins when he argued after Wood walked Geoff Blum -- his third
walk of the inning -- to load the bases in the third.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Lenny Webster had an infield single and moved to
second on Eric Young's error. Thurman walked on a full count, and
Bergeron had a bunt single to load the bases. After Vidro struck
out, White's hit and Sosa's error cleared the bases to make it 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Van Poppel, whose contract was purchased from Triple-A Iowa
on Thursday, relieved Wood and allowed one hit in 2 2-3 innings. He
struck out three in his Cubs debut.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago scored twice in the seventh to close to 7-3. Sosa hit a
bases-loaded sacrifice fly off Steve Kline and Henry Rodriguez, and
Shane Andrews drew consecutive walks to force in a run.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Telford relieved and got pinch-hitter Glenallen Hill to
fly out to right to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Vidro had an RBI double in the eighth to drive in the Expos'
eighth run.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Cubs re-acquired OF Dave Martinez from Tampa Bay on
Friday for LHP Mark Guthrie and cash. Martinez, drafted by the Cubs
in 1983, returns for his third stint in Chicago. He made his major
league debut with the Cubs from 1986-88 and played with the White
Sox from 1995-97. ... 1B Mark Grace is traveling with the team,
despite having been placed on the DL on Thursday with a strained
left hamstring. ... Urbina, who was placed on the 15-day DL Friday,
had an arthrogram performed on his injured right elbow. ...
Montreal's Andy Tracy went 0-for-3, including two strikeouts, in
his first major league start at third base. ... Montreal's Vladimir
Guerrero tried to throw out Joe Girardi at first on his single to
right leading off the fifth.

   LONDON (AP) -- Gervase Cowell, a British diplomat who was
expelled from the Soviet Union for having contact with an
informant, died May 2. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   Posted to the British Embassy in Moscow in 1962, Cowell was
expelled the next year following the Soviets' discovery that Col.
Oleg Penkovsky, a member of the Soviet secret service, had been
passing information to U.S. and British contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Cowell was among 12 Americans and Britons identified by Soviet
authorities as Penkovsky's principal contacts. Penkovsky was

Alex Kerr:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Alex ''Andy'' Kerr, a Navy captain who figured in
a key decision in the life of Lee Harvey Oswald, died Saturday of
cancer of the larynx. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and went on to become
an aide to four secretaries of the Navy, most prominently with John
Connally in the Kennedy administration.
</P>
<P>
   A former academy colleague, Hank Searls, recalled the day that
Kerr received a letter from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ''The writer, one Lee Harvey Oswald, asked that the secretary
reverse his Marine Corps less-than-honorable discharge and grant
him an honorable one, but Kerr had never been a rubber-stamp
bureaucrat. He learned Oswald had been a lousy Marine,'' Searls
said. ''He advised Secretary Connally to turn down the request.''
</P>
<P>
   Connally, who went on to become governor of Texas, was wounded
when Oswald shot President John Kennedy to death on Nov. 22, 1963.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ''A Journey Amongst the Good and the Great,'' Kerr
speculated that Oswald might have been gunning for Connally rather
than the president.

Craig Stevens:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Craig Stevens, the actor who played the suave
private eye ''Peter Gunn'' in the 1950s TV series, died Wednesday
of cancer. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   ''Peter Gunn,'' which was created by filmmaker Blake Edwards,
debuted in 1958 and was known for its film noir style, deadpan
humor and jazzy theme song by Henry Mancini.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens appeared in many films throughout the 1940s and 1950s,
including ''Humoresque,'' ''Since You Went Away'' and ''Night Unto
Night.''
</P>
<P>
   He later appeared on television shows such as ''Dallas'' and
''Man of the World.''
</P>

   His last role in a major film was in Edwards' Hollywood satire
''S.O.B.'' in 1981.
Paula Wessely:
</P>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Paula Wessely, postwar Austria's foremost
theater and movie actress and one of the most acclaimed performers
in the German-speaking world, died Thursday. She was 93.
</P>
<P>
   While praised for some of the finest stage acting of the 20th
century, Wessely was also accused of being a tool of the Nazis for
having appeared in Nazi propaganda films throughout World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Wessely's career spanned more than six decades. ''The Wessely,''
as her fans would lovingly call her, was a household word in
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   She was the star in many Nazi-era movies, but the part most held
against her was the leading role in the Nazi propaganda movie
''Heimkehr'' (Homecoming) produced in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Wessely had regrets for that role, but some
critics remained unconvinced by her token repentance.
</P>
<P>
   She excelled in most key female roles of the German and
non-German drama, from Friedrich Schiller's ''Mary Stuart'' to
Arthur Schnitzler's ''Anatol,'' and from Henryk Ibsen's ''John
Gabriel Borkman'' to Tennessee Williams ''Glass Menagerie.''
</P>

world's best actresses, and Bette Davis is known to have watched

<HEADLINE> Padres Shuffle Bullpen Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The San Diego Padres shuffled their pitching
staff Friday, demoting a starter and a reliever and promoting a
starter and two relievers from Triple-A Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres also placed right-handed reliever Rodney Myers on the
60-day disabled list and announced he will undergo surgery on
Saturday to repair a torn tendon in his left knee he suffered
Thursday on the artificial turf in Cincinnati. Myers is expected to
miss the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres recalled Brandon Kolb and purchased the contracts of
Stan Spencer and Matt Whiteside from Las Vegas. Spencer is
scheduled to start Saturday against Todd Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   To make room on the roster, starter Rodrigo Lopez was optioned
and reliever Vicente Palacios was outrighted, both to Vegas. All
pitchers involved in the moves are right-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer was 4-0 with a 1.72 ERA in six starts with the Stars to
earn his third big league stint in three seasons. Spencer struggled
last year while up with the Padres, going 0-7 with a 9.16 ERA in
two trips to the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Kolb is making his first trip to the majors. The 26-year-old
right-hander was 0-1 with a 3.14 ERA and eight saves in 14 games
out of the bullpen with Las Vegas. Whiteside was 1-2 with a 3.21
ERA in 11 relief appearances. He has pitched in the big leagues
every year since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez went 0-1 with a 10.24 ERA in three starts. After limiting
Atlanta to one run on four hits in seven innings of his major
league debut on April 29, he failed to make it through two innings
in either of last two starts. Palacios was 0-1 with a 6.74 ERA in
seven games out of the bullpen.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Khamenei Blasts Reformists  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
on Friday lashed out at reformists, accusing them of undermining
his position and the country's Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some are opposing the very basis and values of Islam in the
name of reforms. The biggest danger is cultural. Those who were
servants of oppression (the shah's regime) are now chanting slogan
of reforms,'' Khamenei told thousands of Friday prayer worshippers
at Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
   ''They do not mean progress of the Islamic system, they mean
removal of Islam and the position of the supreme leader. They
promote American reforms.'' ''As long as I have responsibility and
I'm alive, I will not allow these people to play with the country's
interests. As long as the great principle of the position of
supreme leader exists, conspiracies may create headaches but will
not be able to destabilize this strong base,'' Khamenei said.
</P>
<P>
   He called on both moderates and hard-liners to close ranks, and
repeated his criticism of the press that led to the hard-line
judiciary shutting down 16 pro-democracy newspapers last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The corrupt press was portraying a distorted, unrealistic and
disappointing image about the present and the future. It was
portraying an atmosphere of tension in the society,'' Khamenei
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Khamenei accused the pro-reform press of becoming
the ''bases of the enemy'' and said the newspapers which accused
the elite revolutionary forces of being involved in the March 12
shooting of leading reformist Saeed Hajjarian were ''detrimental to
the state.''
</P>
<P>
   President Mohammad Khatami and his allies want to loosen rigid
Islamic laws and social restrictions that have been in place since
the 1979 Islamic revolution brought the Shiite clergy to power.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-liners, who control key institutions like the military,
the broadcast network and the judiciary, have found themselves
struggling for survival against the reformist movement, which took
off after Khatami's 1997 election.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Preston Wilson homered and drove in four runs
Friday night, and Ryan Dempster beat the Mets for the second time
in six days in Florida's 6-4 victory over New York.
</P>
<P>
   Dempster (4-2), who pitched a one-hitter in the Marlins' 3-0 win
against the Mets on Sunday, allowed four runs and 10 hits in 5 2-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson hit an RBI double in the third inning and a three-run
homer off Glendon Rusch (1-4) in Florida's four-run fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has seven homers, including three in the last three
games. Derrek Lee also had a solo homer in the fifth to give
Florida a 6-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets drew within two with four runs in the bottom of the
fifth. Derek Bell had an RBI double, Mike Piazza hit a two-run
homer, his ninth, and Robin Ventura followed with a solo shot, his
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Almanzar relieved Dempster with runners on second and
third with two outs in the sixth inning. He struck out Ventura to
get out of the jam. Antonio Alfonseca pitched the ninth for his
12th save in 13 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Dempster aided his own cause in the second inning when he
doubled in a run with his second hit and first RBI of the season.
Wilson gave the Marlins a 2-0 lead with an RBI double in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch allowed six runs and 12 hits in five innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rain delayed the start of the game by 33 minutes. ...
Dempster is 2-1 in his career against the Mets. ... Wilson, the
step-son of Mets first-base coach Mookie Wilson, extended his
hitting streak to seven games. ... When Piazza and Ventura homered
in the Mets fifth it was the third time in four games the Mets had
hit back-to-back homers. ... Melvin Mora, who started at shortstop
in place of injured Rey Ordonez, left the game for the Mets after
diving into first base in the fifth on a bunt single and took four
stitches in the right index finger.

<HEADLINE> China Hands Out Life Sentences  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A Chinese court on Friday sentenced two people to
life imprisonment for their involvement in a fire at a small
theater that killed 74 people, state-run television said.
</P>
<P>
   Han Benyu and Niu Yuwen were among 17 defendants tried for the
March 29 fire by a court in Jiaozuo, a city 360 miles southwest of
Beijing in central China's Henan province, state television said in
its national evening news broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The cinema showed pornographic films, the television said. Han
and Niu were given life prison terms for disseminating obscene
materials and negligence, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight other people, including the man that rented the building
to Han and Niu, were sentenced to prison terms ranging from eight
to three years for crimes including bribery, abuse of power and
forging documents, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Other defendants also got prison terms, the television said
without giving details. Defendants included two people who forgot
to switch off an electric heater that started the blaze, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The cenema had no safety exits and no fire equipment, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 74 people killed were migrant workers who used the
cheap all-night theater as a flophouse because they couldn't afford
accommodations, according to Jiaozuo police.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid economic development and lax enforcement of public safety
regulations have played a role in disasters in China in recent
years -- from building collapses to mine explosions. Last year, a
badly overloaded ferry which set out in stormy seas sank, killing
all but 22 of the 302 people on board.

<HEADLINE> Methodists Join Abortion Fight  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- The United Methodist Church, the
nation's
largest religious body that favors abortion rights, voted Friday to
fight the procedure opponents call ''partial-birth abortion.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 622-275 decision came in the closing moments of a General
Conference where delegates took dozens of liberal political stands.
</P>
<P>
   The eleven-day conference was most notable for Thursday's
emotion-laden decision to uphold church policy against same-sex
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The new abortion policy urges an end to ''the use of late-term
abortion known as dilatation and extraction (partial-birth
abortion)'' except when the mother's life is in danger or there are
''severe fetal anomalies incompatible with life.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegates voted down an amendment proposed by district
superintendent Sally Dyck of Wooster, to add the mother's health to
grounds justifying the procedure. Steve Furr, a physician in
Jackson, Ala., opposed that addition: ''This is just a gaping hole
to allow a procedure that should not go on in a humane society.''
</P>
<P>
   The General Conference meets every four years to set policy for
the United Methodist Church, which has 8.4 million U.S. members. It
is the nation's third largest denomination behind the Roman
Catholic Church and Southern Baptist Convention, both of which
strongly oppose abortion.

<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- President Clinton declared two
eastern Missouri counties federal disaster areas Friday, days after
heavy rains caused flash floods.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in Franklin and Jefferson counties are now eligible
for federal grants and low-interest loans to help rebuild their
homes and businesses, said Jerry Nachtigal, spokesman for Gov. Mel
Carnahan.
</P>
<P>
   As much as15 inches of rain fell Saturday night and Sunday
morning, causing severe flash flooding and killing two people who
became trapped in vehicles by floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said preliminary information showed more than 500 homes
and businesses were damaged or destroyed. While a final total
damage estimate was not yet available, officials have estimated it
at more than $100 million.

<HEADLINE> Big Lottery Winner Comes Forward  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY BARKS HOFFMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- A swimming-pool installer who put down a
$100 bill for a hot dog and 98 Big Game lottery tickets stepped
forward with his wife and three children Friday to claim half of
the record-breaking $363 million jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I'd like to start a new job playing golf,'' said Larry
Ross, a 47-year-old occasional lottery player accustomed to working
80 to 100 hours a week in the summer. ''We haven't had a summer
vacation in 13 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross and his wife, Nancy, will take their share of the bounty in
a lump-sum payment of about $90 million before taxes. After the
lottery deducts 28 percent for federal taxes and 4.2 percent in
state income taxes, the Rosses will get about $61.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The other winning Big Game ticket was sold in Lake Zurich, Ill.,
30 miles northwest of Chicago. That winner has not yet come
forward.
</P>
<P>
   The $363 million jackpot was the richest in U.S. history, but
the biggest individual payout is still the $197 million awarded
last year to a Massachusetts woman.
</P>
<P>
   Ross bought his ticket to Tuesday's drawing at Mr. K's Party
Shoppe near Utica, 20 miles north of Detroit. He had stopped in to
buy a hot dog, and all he had was a $100 bill. At his wife's
urging, ''I asked the guy to give me change in lotto tickets,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he wrote down the winning numbers incorrectly Tuesday
night on the way home and didn't realize one of his
computer-selected tickets was a winner until he saw it on
television Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jesus, they match!'' he told his wife. Then, he said, ''I
invented a new dance -- I started doing the lottery dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is looking to retire and buy a boat, a house and maybe
that the purple Jaguar that his wife has always wanted. He said he
plans to give some of the money to charity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to do anything rash. We're going to invest
wisely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rosses have been married 25 years. Their children are: Ian,
21, Eric, 25, Shannon, 12.
</P>
<P>
   Ross paused at the end of his news conference to wipe away
tears, but otherwise appeared as ''remarkably quite calm'' as
lottery officials said he was when he first called them Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, ''I haven't slept in three days. It's a
great diet program: win the lotto and lose weight. I haven't eaten
in three days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the family plans to move from their four-bedroom ranch
in Shelby Township to a more secure neighborhood somewhere in
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have the ecstasy of winning and then you start realizing
the agony of what might happen,'' he said. ''You've got security
problems now. You think about your family, who's at risk. We're not
in a secure neighborhood. We don't have security like rich people
have.''
</P>
<P>
   The states that participate in the Big Game are Georgia,
Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and
Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Indians 7, Royals 3  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Bartolo Colon and Kenny Lofton both returned
from the disabled list Friday night and made immediate impacts,
leading the Cleveland Indians to a 7-3 victory over the Kansas City
Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Colon, pitching for the first time since April 15, held Kansas
City to three hits in six innings while Lofton went 3-for-4 and
bunted home the go-ahead run in the fifth for the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Fryman hit a clutch two-out, two-run double in the sixth
and Manny Ramirez and David Justice homered for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians weren't the same while Colon and Lofton were on the
DL.
</P>
<P>
   A pulled rib cage muscle landed Colon (3-1) on the DL for the
first time in his career, and while their No. 1 starter was out,
the Indians' starting rotation was out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   And without the speedy Lofton, Cleveland's offense was stagnant,
forcing the Indians to rely too often on the home run.
</P>
<P>
   But with Colon back on the mound, and Lofton, who also had a
steal, back on the basepaths, the Indians were back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Batista (1-1) allowed five runs and seven hits in six
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Staked to a 2-0 lead on solo shots by Justice and Ramirez, Colon
struck out five in the first two innings, including four in a row.
He fanned Joe Randa on a 99 mph fastball for the second out of the
second, and took a no-hitter into the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Beltran walked leading off and Colon gave up a single to
Randa before Mark Quinn's RBI single brought the Royals within 2-1.
Brian Johnson tied it with a single.
</P>
<P>
   Colon escaped further trouble by getting Rey Sanchez on a pop
foul; striking out Johnny Damon and watching as shortstop Omar
Vizquel backhanded Carlos Febles' grounder in the hole and threw to
second for the force.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Fryman had a leadoff double and went to third on a
flyout. Lofton then took advantage of Febles playing too deep at
second and perfectly pushed a bunt his way for an RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians made it 5-2 in the sixth on Fryman's sinking liner
to left that kicked away from a diving Damon as two runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   After Kansas City got a run back in the seventh on Johnson's RBI
double off Scott Kamieniecki, Cleveland got two runs in the bottom
of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Einar Diaz doubled and scored on a double by Lofton, who raced
home on Roberto Alomar's tapper in front of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Justice connected for his seventh homer with two outs in the
second to put the Indians up 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's 11th homer and third in two games gave Cleveland a 2-0
lead in the fourth. In his last 22 games, Ramirez is batting .339
(31-for-92) with nine homers and 27 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ramirez has an RBI in a career-high eight straight games.
... The Cleveland Fire Department canceled a postgame fireworks
display saying a preliminary test firing put the Jacobs Field
crowd's safety at risk. ... Kansas City, leading the AL in steals,
swiped two more and is 39-for-43 this year. Damon is 14-for-14 in
steal attempts. ... Colon is 4-1 in six career starts vs. Kansas
City. ... If the Royals could only get out of the second inning.
They've been outscored 36-7 in the second this season.

<HEADLINE> Frankel: I Sought To Feed Hungry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Martin Frankel, the former financier accused of
bilking insurance companies out of more than $200 million, said in
a prison interview that he was only trying to make money to help
the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview that aired Friday on the ABC News program
''20/20,'' Frankel denied allegations that he used a bogus charity
tied to the Roman Catholic Church to help him steal millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fed some of the most hungry people in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The interview was taped in the Hamburg, Germany, prison where
Frankel is being held.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Frankel, 45, bought up small insurance
companies in states with reputations for lax regulation, then
looted the companies. They say he claimed to have had $1 billion in
Vatican backing to convince investors that their money was safe
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel allegedly ran an unlicensed brokerage from a
fortress-like, two-mansion compound in Greenwich, Conn. He
disappeared in May 1999, leaving behind piles of smoldering
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Months later he was arrested in Germany. Investigators found a
stack of forged travel documents and a stash of cash and diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel has said he will resist extradition to the United
States. German charges of passport fraud must be resolved before
extradition proceedings can begin.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Frankel denied living a lavish lifestyle.
Former employees, some of them women recruited through personal ads
in New York newspapers, have said Frankel showered them with gifts
that included luxury cars and clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel told ABC he was just looking for a soul mate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to fall in love with someone,'' he said. ''I
supported them, I took care of them as best I could, and I think
that is probably the main reason I am here is that I loved people
too much and I tried to take care of people too much.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Frankel faces state and federal charges
and, if convicted, could spend the rest of his life in prison. He
said such a lengthy prison term would not be fair, and hopes that
Germany will refuse to allow his extradition on human rights
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no violence, no one is murdered, no one is killed.
They are financial crimes,'' he said. ''Whether it's one dollar or
a billion dollars, to put someone in jail for the rest of their
life, if you think that's just ... in my opinion the people who
think that are inhumane and unjust.''

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Strike Midwest  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A quickly moving storm spawned tornadoes, high winds
and
baseball-sized hail from Texas to Michigan Friday night, killing
one person in Texas and injuring at least two dozen others. A
4-year-old Kansas girl died earlier in the day in aftermath of a
tornado.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One person died in Hill County, about 60 miles south of Dallas,
when a twister touched down Friday evening, said Cpl. Charlie
Morgan with the Texas Department of Public Safety. The storm ripped
roofs off houses and flipped mobile homes as the storm moved
through.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Nazianz, Wis., straight-line wind gusts up to 110 mph and
baseball-size hail caused heavy damage to a mobile home park Friday
night, where several people were injured, said Nancy Crowley,
Manitowoc County Emergency Government spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trailer court disappeared,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   About 28 people were injured as the storm hit east-central
Wisconsin. One person was in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still shaking,'' said St. Nazianz resident Magdaline
Steffen. ''It got totally black outside, so I went into the
basement. All of a sudden everything shook. I can't even describe
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Storms also swept through Illinois with rain, high winds, hail
and at least two tornadoes in the southern part of the state.
Storms in the Chicago area contributed to flight delays and
cancelations at O'Hare and Midway airports. There were reports of
minor damage throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms pounded the northern half of Michigan's lower
peninsula, leaving behind a few downed trees. Several counties
reported hail, with the most extreme of baseball-sized hail
reported in Huron County.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, a 4-year-old girl in Tonganoxie, Kan., died
after a porch roof collapsed onto her. The roof was believed to
have been damaged by a tornado that hit Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   In Tonganoxie, officials estimated up to 200 homes and a dozen
businesses were damaged. An elementary school was closed because
damage to its roof allowed water to seep into classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack toured the area of northeastern Iowa hit
by a dozen tornadoes Thursday night and declared disaster areas in
Black Hawk and Buchanan counties. Three storm-related injuries were
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's devastation,'' he said. ''I've never seen homes,
farmsteads, farm buildings quite as pulverized as those which we've
seen today.''

<HEADLINE> Angels' Pitcher Mercker Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Angels pitcher Kent Mercker was in
intensive care Friday after being hospitalized for bleeding in his
brain. He had left Anaheim's game a night earlier complaining of
headaches and dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   Team physician Dr. Lewis Yocum, who visited Mercker early Friday
evening, said the pitcher was alert and completely coherent and
that the bleeding had stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker, 32, was hospitalized late Thursday night and will
remain in intensive care at UC-Irvine Medical Center throughout the
weekend for further observation and evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   John Kusske, head of neurologic surgery at the hospital, said
test results indicated there was bleeding within the brain. The
cause was not determined and further tests will be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Angels general manager Bill Stoneman, pitcher Kent Bottenfield --
a longtime friend of Mercker's and teammate in St. Louis --
accompanied Yocum to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was happy to see us, especially Kent Bottenfield,''
Stoneman said. ''We all chatted and he chatted very coherently.
Although he was tired, he was in a lot better shape than I
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought Mercker's career was threatened, Yocum said
that was a possibility as with any serious injury, ''But I see no
real ominous signs at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Yocum, the Angels' doctor for 23 season, said he did not
remember a baseball player ever having a similar problem. He also
said that, while the neurologists still haven't determined the
cause of Mercker's bleeding, such an incident sometimes happens to
an individual once and does not recur.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker, making his second start of the season, threw 30 pitches
against Texas on Thursday night before sinking to one knee and
leaving the game under his own power.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year veteran, who pitched a no-hitter for Atlanta on
April 8, 1994, at Los Angeles, is 0-1 with a 5.16 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker appeared to be in great pain as he attempted to pitch,
and the game was halted briefly with in the second inning, then
stopped five pitches later as he bent over and rested on one knee.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim manager Mike Scioscia found it difficult to talk
anything else during Friday's batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''When something like this happens, you are talking about a guy
in his early thirties having a problem like this, that transcends
everything that happens on a baseball field and makes everything
else trivial,'' Scioscia said. ''This is a very scary situation for
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone in the medical department was very concerned last
night -- and when they are concerned, you know it's something that
has to be dealt with quickly. It hits home and is scary for a
number of reasons. The uncertainty of what caused it causes
uneasiness for Kent and all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker's wife, Julie, was scheduled to fly in from their home
in Dublin, Ohio, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman said the pitcher's wife had been very worried, but ''By
the time I had talked with her and she had talked with the
neurosurgeon and Dr. Yocum, she was feeling more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker signed as a minor league free agent with the Angels last
Jan. 26. He also has played for Baltimore, Cleveland, Cincinnati,
St. Louis and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He was placed on the disabled list Friday evening.

<HEADLINE> Rocker Gets Warm Welcome in Philly  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- John Rocker got a nice welcome in a most
unlikely city -- until he pitched.
</P>
<P>
   In the town that once booed Santa Claus, cheered the temporary
paralysis of Michael Irvin and just two days ago threw debris
during an NBA playoff game, Rocker was embraced before the Braves'
8-7 victory over the Phillies on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   He got a mixed reaction when he entered the game in the ninth.
Some fans booed Rocker while others gave him a standing ovation.
The boos didn't compare to those directed at Phillies reliever
Wayne Gomes, who blew his third save in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker earned his eighth save in nine tries by retiring Scott
Rolen with the tying run on second base. After the game, he went
through a 45-minute workout session. Rocker refused to comment when
he emerged from the weight room, accompanied by a team official and
flanked by a major league baseball security guard.
</P>
<P>
   ''Go away. I'm not answering any questions,'' Rocker said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was surprised by the positive part of the reaction
from fans, he said, ''Y'all are precious.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Other than New York, this was one of the places that was
looked at as being tough on him,'' Braves left-hander Tom Glavine
said. ''It was no worse or no better.''
</P>
<P>
   Signs like ''You Can Rock Me John'' greeted Rocker when he
walked onto the field at Veterans Stadium at 5:42 p.m. Several
hundred fans were already in the ballpark when the reliever came
out before the Braves-Phillies game.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a heavy security presence, many fans flocked to him,
waving baseballs, caps and assorted items in hopes of getting an
autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came to see the Braves, but John Rocker is OK in my book,''
said 25-year-old Joy Davis, who drew a chuckle and an autograph
from Rocker when she waved her ''Rock Me'' sign at him. ''If he
gets in tonight, you'll hear me cheer.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, whose offensive comments about minorities, gays and
immigrants in New York made him baseball's most controversial
figure, was the most popular player on the field before the game.
</P>
<P>
   He chatted with fans along the left-field line, tossed baseballs
into the stands and signed autographs for several minutes. He was
the first player on either team to sign, was joined for a couple
minutes by Greg Maddux and Bobby Bonilla, and was the last player
off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's OK,'' said Bob Creech, a Yankees fan who drove down from
New York with his wife and two children. ''He has opinions. There's
bigots in New York, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, often a target of fans' heckling in Philadelphia,
wasn't surprised by Rocker's reception.
</P>
<P>
   ''It depends on where he goes,'' Bonilla said. ''Nothing is
going to be as bad as New York. He didn't say anything bad about
Philly.''
</P>
<P>
   Security at the Vet was increased in anticipation of Rocker's
arrival. Police officers lined the area above the Atlanta bullpen
before and during the game. Fans were not allowed to stand in that
area during batting practice while Rocker played catch in the
outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hallinan, head of security for major league baseball, and
a couple staff members made the trip to Philadelphia. They've also
been to San Diego, Los Angeles and Miami before or during Rocker's
visit to those cities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just here to tighten things up, to make sure we're all
on the same page,'' Hallinan said. ''We want this to be a ballgame,
not a security event.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan's son, Tom, and another staff member sat
inconspicuously in the left-field seats while Rocker warmed up
before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're paying attention to the areas that we should be
watching,'' Kevin Hallinan said. ''We're looking at the bullpen as
the area. We want to keep the concentration on the game. We'll be
around, but we don't want to make a big deal out of it.''

   NEW YORK (AP) -- New York City Police have found a trailer in
Queens that was stolen from New Jersey earlier this week and was
filled with cyanide.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities cordoned off an area in an industrial park near the
Long Island Expressway in Long Island City.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately known if the cyanide was still inside the
abandoned trailer.
</P>
<P>
   The trailer was reported missing May 4, after it was taken from
the Union County warehouse in Linden, N.J. It contained a shipping
container with 20 drums of potassium cyanide, each about as big as
a beer keg, along with machinery, car parts and tape measures.
</P>
<P>
   Linden police had said the trailer was hauled away by truck, and
the thieves were probably unaware of their deadly cargo.
</P>
<P>
   New York City was first informed of the missing trailer on
Thursday night, said Richard J. Sheirer, the director of the city's
Office of Emergency Management. The trailer, which was found
without a cab and without plates, was located by a police grid
search.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't believe it's terrorists,'' said Sheirer. People in
the area were being moved upwind of the trailer late Friday, as
workers dressed in protective gear prepared to enter the trailer.
There are no homes in the industrial park, which runs alongside the
Long Island Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   Potassium cyanide is used in electroplating, a process employed
to make silverware and jewelry, and can be fatal to anyone who
drinks or inhales it. The manmade liquid kills by preventing oxygen
from reaching vital organs.
</P>
<P>
   In case the orange barrels were removed from the trailer,
Sheirer advised anyone who sees one: ''Don't touch them, don't
remove them, call 911 immediately.''

<HEADLINE> Hearst CEO Defends Editorial Offer  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT ANDREWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Top Hearst Corp. executives testified
Friday that they had no knowledge of an offer to give Mayor Willie
Brown favorable editorials in the San Francisco Examiner in
exchange for his support of Hearst's purchase of the rival
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was horrified,'' said Hearst CEO Frank Bennack Jr. ''If
true, it is clearly outside and contrary to our policies ... and
Journalism 101.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst is being sued by Clint Reilly, a real estate investor and
former mayoral candidate, on antitrust grounds to block its
purchase of the Chronicle and the subsidized transfer of the
Examiner to a company set up by publisher Ted Fang.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the deal have said Hearst executives knew last year
about the offer by now-suspended Publisher Timothy White to Brown.
They also were accused of taking action against White only because
he disclosed the offer publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Bennack and Hearst Newspapers President George Irish said they
were unaware of the offer until White testified about it in court
on May 1. Bennack said he would have disciplined White earlier if
he had known about the publisher's similar testimony in a
deposition in December.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has said he can't recall whether such an offer was made.
</P>
<P>
   Irish said he did not believe White had correctly answered the
question in court about his offer to the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've known Tim White for nine years and I've known him to be a
very honorable person and I just think he was confused,'' Irish
testified.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle and Examiner are jointly run, except for editorial
functions, under a federal antitrust exemption. The owners of both
papers want to terminate the joint operating agreement five years
early.
</P>
<P>
   On the trial's first day, White testified that he made the offer
to Brown. He later recanted in a written statement to the media,
saying the editorial independence of the paper was never in
jeopardy. No attempt has been made in court to retract or
contradict his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Bennack also testified about his negotiations for the Chronicle,
saying Hearst's first offer of $565 million was met with the
Chronicle Publishing Co.'s counteroffer of $700 million. The
companies eventually settled on $660 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bennack said he plans to improve the Chronicle editorially,
using increased profits he anticipates from shedding the Examiner,
which has about one-quarter the readers of the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have the opportunity to give this region the kind
of world-class newspaper it is entitled to,'' he testified. ''That
is what we intend to do.''

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Members Celebrate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Followers of the Falun Gong sect held yellow
flowers and signs aloft in Tiananmen Square, defiantly celebrating
their banned spiritual movement's eighth anniversary Saturday and
drawing rough arrest by Chinese police.
</P>
<P>
   Police beat five people as they tried to unfurl a banner.
Another woman was knocked to the ground by plainclothes security
officers as she stood amid 10 followers raising signs. One read
''Truthfulness, Benevolence, Forbearance,'' Falun Gong's motto.
</P>
<P>
   By midmorning, police had seized at least 40 people staging
small, sporadic acts of civil disobedience across the vast square
in central Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The protest was the third recent demonstration to mark key sect
anniversaries. On April 25, they came to remember a protest by
10,000 followers last year that provoked the communist government's
crackdown. On Thursday, they honored founder Li Hongzhi's birthday.
Saturday marked the sect's founding in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   About a half-dozen followers raised yellow chrysanthemums for
the anniversary. Police hustled them away, leaving the flowers
scattered on the square's gray paving stones. A street sweeping
truck was sent in to clean away the protest's remains.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow is an auspicious color for Chinese and has been adopted
by Falun Gong. Banners the followers tried to raise were yellow
with vibrant red Chinese characters on them. ''Falun Dafa'' --
another name for the group -- read one banner before police ripped
it out from their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Even foreign tourists, milling among the thousands of Chinese
visiting the scenic square, were not spared mistreatment. At least
three tourists were detained, apparently for videotaping protests.
A uniformed officer pushed and kicked one of them into a police
van.
</P>
<P>
   Police have adopted increasingly rougher tactics -- evidence of
their frustration in failing to stop demonstrations 9{ months after
the government banned Falun Gong as a public menace and threat to
Communist Party rule.
</P>
<P>
   Before the July ban, Falun Gong attracted millions of followers
in China. A blend of slow-motion exercises, Buddhist and Taoist
cosmology and Li's often unorthodox ideas, Falun Gong is believed
by practitioners to promote health and morality.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders accuse the group of causing 1,559 deaths --
mostly for refusing medical treatment -- giving 600 others
psychiatric problems and cheating people by making them pay for
books and teachings.

<HEADLINE> Hurst Leads LPGA Electrolux  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) -- Pat Hurst refused to let a little wind
bother her on Friday, shooting a 4-under-par 68 and building her
lead to six strokes after two rounds of the Electrolux USA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst, who grew up in playing in San Francisco, started the day
with a 2-stroke lead. But as others kept struggling to pick the
right clubs with winds gusting between 20 and 25 mph, Hurst turned
in a five-birdie, one-bogey round for an 11-under-par 133 total.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Figg-Currier (72) and Michelle Redman (69) were tied for
second at 5-under 139. Karrie Webb (67), Jeong Jang (67), Michelle
McGann (69), Mhairi McKay (71) and Mary Beth Zimmerman (70) were at
140, and Juli Inkster was among three at 141.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 76 making the cut at 4-over 148 was 17-year-old
amateur Courtney Wood of Nashville at 147.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst, whose last tour victory was the 1998 Nabisco Dinah Shore,
said the key is concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as you don't get down saying, 'My God, it's windy out
here. I can't believe it,' it really makes you concentrate. It
makes you think each shot,'' she said. ''You're focusing on each
shot because you know you have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurst, who went to San Jose University, pointed out that the
winds came off the bay in San Francisco every afternoon, helping
her learn how to play in less than ideal conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of like bad weather,'' she said. ''I think it brings
out the best in you if you let it.''
</P>
<P>
   With 36 holes left, no one is ready to concede to Hurst, playing
her best golf since giving birth to her first child last June. Webb
rebounded from her second-worst round this year, an opening 73,
with six birdies and one bogey, and she could've been closer if she
hadn't lipped out a birdie putt on the par-4 18th.
</P>
<P>
   When Webb shot a second-round 75 in January, she wound up
winning The Office Depot tournament. Looking for her fifth LPGA
Tour victory this year and seventh overall, the Australian said
Hurst is playing well and that it is her tournament to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll all just be playing chase,'' Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   With no one closing the gap, Hurst ignored the scoreboard and
worried only about her next shot. She credited caddie Dan Wilson
with giving her the right club for every shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been right on target. That allows you to get close to the
hole,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst started slowly on the back nine with four straight pars
before taking advantage of the par 5, 545-yard 14th. She hit a lob
wedge to 4 feet, setting up her first birdie. Her longest birdie
putt came on the par-4 No. 15 after an 8-iron left her 6 feet
short.
</P>
<P>
   She ran into trouble on No. 18 when she hit her second shot into
the water and couldn't get up and down for only her second bogey
through the first 36 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst, whose best finish was a second-place at the
Welch's-Circle K Championship earlier this year, said the lead will
give her some confidence on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy with where I am, so I'm not going to get too down on
myself if I lose a couple shots,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Divots: Five golfers withdrew on Friday due to a variety of
injuries, but the worst was Pearl Sinn. She opened with a 78, but
had to be carted off the course Friday when her allergy to fescue
grass, which makes up the rough, hit. She had hives so bad that her
eyes had swollen shut. ... Dottie Pepper withdrew after a double
bogey due to an injured right wrist. Pepper was only four strokes
off the lead after an opening 69. Jennifer Feldott pulled out with
an injured shoulder, and Sally Dee and Cindy Flom each suffered
from stomach flu, which has been sweeping through the tour. ...
Susan Ginter was disqualified for signing her scorecard. Her ball
moved when she put her putter down on her final hole, and she only
penalized herself one stroke instead of two. ... Nancy Lopez,
scheduled to have her gallbladder removed on Tuesday, was happy to
make the cut despite being 4-over. She said she wants another
chance to try and shoot under par.
