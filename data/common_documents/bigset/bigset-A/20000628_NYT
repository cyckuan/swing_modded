LAZIO SAYS MRS. CLINTON WAGES A FEAR CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rep. Rick Lazio on Tuesday night accused Hillary
Rodham Clinton of waging a campaign based on fear and warned that
her latest television commercials attacking his record would
backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what these attack ads are all about,'' Lazio said at a
sparsely attended fund-raiser at the Sheraton Hotel in midtown
Manhattan. ``They're about fear.'' He added, ``If these attacks
continue, my opponent will learn this about New York: Bend the
truth, and you will face the consequences. New Yorkers will not
elect a person they cannot trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's escalating attacks came in response to Clinton's
intensified criticism in recent weeks, both for his votes in
Congress and his positions on gun control, abortion and education
financing. Clinton has also released a series of television
advertisements attacking Lazio for what she says is his opposition
to legislation on hate crimes and health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry to say that my opponent is now on her fifth
negative attack ad,'' Lazio said as the crowd booed the first lady.
``That makes five negative attack ads over the last 10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio added that the advertisements were designed ``to fool New
Yorkers, to drag New Yorkers down.'' Then he invoked the name of
the New York senator whom he and Clinton are seeking to replace:
``You know, Pat Moynihan never needed to use attack ads like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Next he addressed his opponent: ``Maybe, Mrs. Clinton, we
shouldn't expect you to know that. Because you've never seen a New
York campaign. You've never lived here through a New York
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor in the race, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, picked up
where the congressman had left off. ``I mean it really is hard when
you step back from this to completely assess the arrogance of all
this,'' Giuliani said. ``Never having lived here, never having held
public office and, `I want to be your senator?' I mean, we have to
demand more than that, don't we?'' The mayor also retooled one of
his favorite insults from his days as Clinton's opponent, aiming
again at one of Chappaqua's newest residents. ``I think what they
should do is put Rick and Hillary in an automobile at La Guardia
Airport and figure out who can actually get home on their own,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Karen Dunn, a spokeswoman for Clinton's campaign, responded:
``Rick Lazio couldn't get through his announcement speech without
attacking Hillary Clinton. It's clear that things haven't changed
much. What New Yorkers will really learn in this race is that Rick
Lazio has a voting record he can't defend.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials said the Sheraton fund-raiser and another
one for Lazio were expected to raise $1.7 million. Nonetheless, the
ballroom at the Sheraton was only a quarter full at best, and many
Republicans were asking last night whose idea it was to rent such a
large space.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Clinton gave a detailed response to Lazio's
contention that the Clinton administration is to blame for federal
gasoline taxes that have caused higher prices at the pumps. She
argued that New York stands to lose millions of dollars in revenue
for highway construction if those taxes are suspended or repealed,
as Lazio urged by calling for the 18.3 cents per gallon federal tax
to be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in Buffalo it's gone up 50 cents since last year and oil
company profits have gone up almost as much as 500 percent,''
Clinton said. ``Prices are out of control for consumers and profits
are out of line for the oil companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, on a campaign swing in upstate New York that also
included the Buffalo area, asked on Monday for a six-month
suspension of the 18.3 cents per gallon federal tax, and suggested
that part of it, a 4.3 cents per gallon tax enacted seven years
ago, be eliminated. He made the same suggestion at an Eastchester
gas station Tuesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Giuliani joined the fray at a Manhattan gas station, saying a
survey of 80 city stations found an average $1.78 a gallon price
for regular.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton argued that the gas tax ``is one of the few
exceptions where we get more money back than we send to
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what New York pays in the gas tax: over $300 million
dollars a year,'' she said, holding up her charts. ``I got that
figure from my opponent's press release. And the amount that New
York state gets back from Washington in highway funding is $477
million a year. So our surplus is almost $177 million a year.''

HIGH GAS PRICES THIS SUMMER MAY MEAN SOARING HEATING BILLS THIS
WINTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Missouri is prepared to waive a rule that
prevents natural gas utilities from raising rates this summer and
is worried that a key program meant to protect consumers from price
spikes is in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   The moves _ and concerns _ are the latest sign of the trouble
that rising gas prices are beginning to play. The higher prices are
fueling increasingly gloomy predictions that consumers should
prepare for prices that could boost heating bills $200 to $300 over
the course of the upcoming winter.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators definitely are worried, said Mike Straub, assistant
manager of gas rates for the Missouri Public Service Commission,
the state's utility regulating body.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's staff told the state's gas utilities Monday
that it would accept requests to raise rates this summer to recover
unexpectedly high gas costs. Normally, the next adjustment would
not take place until November.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the commission's staff is raising questions about
the effectiveness of hedging programs used by the state's three
largest gas utilities. That includes Missouri Gas Energy, which has
484,000 customers in western Missouri, most of them in the Kansas
City area.
</P>
<P>
   The programs were expected to protect consumers from price
spikes this winter. But rising natural gas prices have played havoc
with the hedges _ a sort of ``inflation insurance'' that, for a few
dollars a customer, caps gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to buy the hedges in summer, when gas prices
usually are down. But tight supplies and utilities' increasing use
of natural gas to generate electricity have pushed wholesale prices
way up _ to about $4.50 per thousand cubic feet in the Midwest,
more than double what they were in January. So the hedges could
still cap prices, but at levels not seen since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Gas Energy said Tuesday it planned to file a request to
raise its purchased gas adjustment _ the part of each customer's
bill that recovers the utility's costs for buying, storing and
transporting gas. It would be effective Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The purchased gas adjustment is at $3.91 per thousand cubic feet
but is expected to go up to about $5.50 if the Public Service
Commission approves. That would increase a customer's gas bill just
a few dollars until November. But with the heavier gas use that
comes with winter heating _ and the possibility of an even higher
purchased gas adjustment in November _ households could be out
hundreds of extra dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Gas Energy said it was also considering changes in its
hedging program. The high gas prices are also raising the cost of
buying the hedges. Among the possibilities under review are
reducing the amount of gas that would be hedged _ even at higher
prices than last year _ or raising the amount of money spent on the
caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to assume is that the prices we are seeing now
are going to stay with us,'' said Rob Hack, a vice president with
Missouri Gas.
</P>
<P>
   Other Missouri utilities are also readying proposals. Laclede
Gas in St. Louis said it would request an increase in the purchased
gas adjustment this summer but was still considering the amount to
raise it.
</P>
<P>
   Rising gas prices are also forcing changes in other states,
including Kansas. Kansas Gas Service has asked that state's
regulators to boost the amount it spends on hedging from $3.5
million to $8 million. And it will also make some changes in how
the program caps prices, said Steve Johnson, a spokesman for the
Kansas utility.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Information Administration recently said it expected
natural-gas prices to remain high into next year, when more
production should ease the tight supply.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, the rising prices are putting to the test various
reforms put in place three years ago after price spikes caused
heating bills to soar.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Missouri utilities could frequently change the
purchased gas adjustment to recover the cost of gas. Missouri
limited those changes to two times a year, plus a third adjustment
that could be made in winter if prices changed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Under those rules, that would have meant no more changes until
Nov. 1. But Straub said gas prices had risen so fast that utilities
would have had to recover much of their costs beginning in
November, when bills are usually going up anyway to cover heating
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The largest change was the hedging program. But now, if current
prices hold, the hedges will be above the $5.81 purchased gas
adjustment that occurred in the price spikes of early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That also poses a dilemma. Do the utilities go ahead and hedge
to protect customers from prices that could spike to $7 or $8 per
thousand cubic feet? Or do they save the estimated $5 to $10 per
customer charge of the hedging program?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure,'' said David Sommerer, the head of the Public
Service Commission's gas procurement division. ``The question is
whether a hedge still makes sense.''

METS BEAT MARLINS, 5-2, FOR 6TH STRAIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In what has become a midseason pennant race if not a
morality play, the Mets mowed down still another victim Tuesday
night and began to set the table for the four-game visit by the
Atlanta Braves that starts Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Glendon Rusch helped extend the Mets' winning streak to six
games by pitching deep into the eighth inning of a 5-2 victory over
the Florida Marlins at Shea Stadium. John Franco and Armando
Benitez finished up.
</P>
<P>
   As significant as the streak is, though, is the fact that the
Mets chopped still another game off the Braves' lead in National
League East. It is down to two games, with the Mets facing the
Marlins again Wednesday night before the theatrics start.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch allowed only five hits and no walks. But with two out in
the Florida eighth, his 5-2 lead was in jeopardy as he yielded a
single to Mark Kotsay after another Marlin reached base on an
error.
</P>
<P>
   Franco came on and handcuffed Cliff Floyd, who hit a bouncer to
first but beat the throw to Franco, who was covering the bag. Now,
with the bases loaded and the Mets leading by three runs, Preston
Wilson, the Marlins' top power hitter, took his stance.
</P>
<P>
   Franco got the count to 1-2 and then threw a fastball past the
flailing Wilson. Franco pumped his arm and dashed off the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez took over in the ninth and got the save, his 18th of the
season, as the shadow of the Braves loomed closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us,'' center fielder Jay Payton said, ``are talking
about the Braves among ourselves. It just hasn't come up in
conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusch (6-5) was formidable over the first three innings. After
mowing down the first eight batters, he was touched for a single
when the opposing pitcher, Jesus Sanchez, bunted along the
third-base line and beat the throw to first.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Mora immediately produced a highlight-film dive to end
the inning. The shortstop pounced to his left to snare Luis
Castillo's sharp grounder up the middle, set himself and then
shoveled the ball to second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo for the
forceout.
</P>
<P>
   But Rusch was not so lucky in the Florida fourth. Kotsay and
Floyd got on with a single and double, and both scored on sacrifice
flies _ Wilson driving in Kotsay and Mike Lowell knocking in Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets responded with a sacrifice fly of their own in their
half of the inning. They loaded the bases on a single and two
walks. Payton lofted a fly to short right, Kotsay grabbed it and
threw home, in what appeared to be enough time to get Derek Bell,
running from third.
</P>
<P>
   But the ball died, and reached Marlins catcher Mike Redmond on a
few hops. As Redmond bent to pick it up, Bell barreled into him,
knocking the ball loose and giving the Mets their first run of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Benny Agbayani drilled a single past short, scoring Alfonzo to
tie the game, and the Mets then took the lead on Todd Pratt's
groundout that scored Todd Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   Joe McEwing delivered the Mets' third hit of the inning, a
single that scored Agbayani for a 4-2 edge.
</P>
<P>
   The outburst made up for the Mets' frustrations the first two
innings, which ended in double plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets added a fifth run in the seventh when Mora hit his
second double of the game and scored on Alfonzo's needle-threading
single to the right side off reliever Braden Looper.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine's lineup lacked his regular Nos. 4 and 5
hitters. Robin Ventura, who normally bats fifth, was on the bench
because of what was described as a sore shoulder; he hurt it diving
for a ball in Monday's game. And the Mets' cleanup hitter, Mike
Piazza, was given a rest, presumably to prepare him for the
four-game series against Atlanta.

WASHINGTON TRIES TO HEAD OFF FOREIGN SUITORS FOR SPRINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Sprint Corp.'s intended merger with WorldCom all
but died Tuesday in Washington, lawmakers tried to head off
potential foreign suitors for Sprint and called for hearings on the
growing complexity of communications pacts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Department of Justice lawsuit to block the merger
brought only light criticism from Kansas City region lawmakers,
with the exception of Missouri's Sen. John Ashcroft. An Ashcroft
spokesman called the government intervention ``distressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although not aimed directly at Sprint, a bill sponsored by five
Democratic senators sought to keep American telecommunication firms
from being purchased by companies that have at least 25 percent
foreign government ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom, owned by German and French
governments, respectively, are looking at U.S. companies, said Sen.
Fritz Hollings of South Carolina, ranking Democrat on the Senate
Commerce Committee. Deutsche Telekom is seen as a potential bidder
for Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings said successful efforts by the U.S. government to
enhance domestic competition plays into hands of foreign interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be facilitating the ease by which foreign-protected
players may emerge with key U.S. assets,'' Hollings said in a news
release. ``While our efforts to foster competition have benefited
consumers, these efforts have depressed the earnings and stock
prices of U.S. domestic providers. However, many of our foreign
counterparts have consistently worked to provide advantages for
their government-owned companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollings also envisioned potential national security risks if
foreign powers owned U.S. telecommunications assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``To permit a foreign government to own such assets would raise
too many troubling questions,'' Hollings said.
</P>
<P>
   Co-sponsors of the Hollings bill are Dan Inouye of Hawaii, Jay
Rockefeller of West Virginia, John Kerry of Massachusetts and Byron
Dorgan of North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   In the House on Tuesday, a telecommunications subcommittee
recommended the Commerce Committee hold a hearing on mergers and
the role of the Justice Department, said Rep. Karen McCarthy, a
Kansas City, Mo., Democrat and subcommittee member.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just so many dramatic changes, things we couldn't
have envisioned or contemplated,'' McCarthy said, giving the growth
in broadband cable access as an example.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said the Sprint-WorldCom merger is an example of the
growing complexity of the telecommunications business in that it
encompassed phone service, Internet access and data network
services.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy did not take a position on the merger and had no
reaction Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was in the hands of the federal regulators to
decide,'' McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Moore, a Johnson County, Kan., Democrat whose 3rd
District is home to Sprint headquarters in Westwood, also hadn't
taken a position on the merger. He said Tuesday he was confident
Sprint would continue to be a strong local business.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ike Skelton, a Democrat from Lexington, Mo., whose district
is home to some Sprint employees and offices, said he favored the
merger and is disappointed it won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it probably would have been a good thing for both
Sprint and WorldCom,'' Skelton said. ``They would have been able to
touch more telecommunications bases and enlarge their business.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican, said in November at a Judiciary
Committee hearing that he was ``strongly inclined'' to support the
merger. He said it ``promises to be a winner for Missouri.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Harris, Ashcroft's press secretary, said Tuesday that the
merger would have strengthened Sprint's presence in Kansas City for
years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprint is a cornerstone of Kansas City's economy,'' Harris
said. ``It is distressing that government lawyers in Washington
think they are better able to shape Sprint's future than (are) the
people of Sprint.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft is seeking re-election and is among many candidates who
have received contributions from Sprint's political action
committee. Sen. Kit Bond, a Missouri Republican who also received
support from Sprint, took no stand on the merger but said through a
spokesman Tuesday he was confident ``Sprint will continue to be
innovative and be at the top of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican who is on the Commerce,
Science and Transportation Committee, had reservations about the
merger last fall and offered no comment Tuesday.

CONSUMER GROUPS APPLAUD JUSTICE DEPARTMENT; FOES CRITICIZE
OPPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL WENSKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ To consumer groups, the Justice Department's
lawsuit to block the merger of WorldCom Inc. and Sprint Corp. was a
no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   But to critics, the Justice Department showed it lacked a brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an easy merger to say no to,'' said Mark Cooper, a
spokesman for the Consumer Federation of America, which opposed the
consolidation of the two largest long-distance companies behind
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper and other consumer group spokesmen said Tuesday the $129
billion combination would whittle competition, smother innovation
and ultimately pump up telephone service costs to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   That's also how the government saw what was the largest merger
in history at the time it was announced last October.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein said Tuesday if
WorldCom acquired Sprint, ``large and small businesses and millions
of individual consumers would have to pay higher prices and accept
lower service quality and innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogwash, critics of the Justice Department responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crystal-ball gazing at its worst,'' said Adam Thierer,
an economics policy fellow at the Heritage Foundation. ``One would
have thought that they'd have allowed it (the merger) to play out
and see what the results would be first.''
</P>
<P>
   The harsh differences in opinion in how consumers might be
affected turn on how one defines the future of telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates saw immediate dangers in a merger that would
reduce from three to two the number of major competitors in the
U.S. long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   They said historically it takes at least three, and probably
more, thriving competitors to keep costs low to consumers, to
prevent collusion and allow new competitors to freely enter into
the market.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, leniency by the Justice Department and the
Federal Communications Commission had prompted a juggernaut of
giant consolidations in the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T spawned seven sibling
regional Bell phone companies, they evolved into just three huge
regional Bell operating companies through an assortment of
expensive mergers, all approved by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't surprising that Sprint and WorldCom felt the need to
join the consolidation binge,'' said David Butler, a spokesman for
Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The action taken Tuesday by the Justice Department was ``a
signal of the beginning of stronger anti-trust enforcement,''
Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates reject the bigger-is-better argument made by
Sprint and WorldCom, that the merger was necessary to create a new
company with the muscle to battle in a new arena of behemoths.
</P>
<P>
   They also reject the notion that telecommunications is fast
becoming a one-package delivery system, rather than one that is
broken into long-distance companies and local phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   A one-size-fits-all industry is a fiction, argues William G.
Shepherd, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts
in Amherst and general editor of the Review of Industrial
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper in May for the Economic Policy Institute, Shepherd
wrote that the evidence ``to support these hyperbolic claims is
insufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, if Sprint and WorldCom were allowed to merge,
``The main competitive pressures on these two long-distance
battlers _ the rivalry between them _ will be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace of innovation is likely to slow, as will the decline
in costs across the variety of their activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, WorldCom and Sprint would combine their 24 percent
and 12 percent shares of the long-distance market into a 36 percent
share.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T would hold 43 percent. The remaining 21 percent, Shepherd
said, would be held by ``the scores of generic non-brand fringe
firms.''
</P>
<P>
   But the critics of the Justice Department action say consumer
groups are relying on 1960s economics to predict the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department is taking prescriptive action rather
than reacting,'' said Thierer. ``How can they predict the outcome
of this merger in today's fast-paced telecommunications industry?''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he said, the difference between long-distance and local
delivery will be meaningless to consumers. ``The relevant market is
the full market of services. It's the broadband delivery of
services.'' How, he asked, can WorldCom and Sprint compete
separately with AT&AMP;T in this new environment that was encouraged to
grow?
</P>
<P>
   John Hoffman, former legal counsel for Sprint and author of a
new book on the history of Sprint, titled Was That a Pin?, said the
action by the Justice Department is ironic.
</P>
<P>
   He said it seemed strange to halt this merger after the
government had already allowed ``the regional Bell operating
companies to re-create the Bell monopoly'' through a series of
mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not looking forward. They're looking backward,'' he
said. He said the regional Bell companies are already emerging as
competitors in long distance in New York and possibly soon in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next handful of years, people won't see the difference
between local and long distance,'' he said. ``That's happening now
in the wireless industry and on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, consumer advocates say the Justice Department is
justified in slowing down the furious stampede toward mergers that
have lately typified the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a reflection that the government is getting tougher on
some of these large mergers,'' said Albert Foer, president of the
American Antitrust Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a merger that probably wouldn't even have been attempted
in years past. It pushed the envelope.

 After merger bogs down, WorldCom Inc. could become takeover
target  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WorldCom Inc., a perennial aggressor through scores of mergers
engineered by Chief Executive Bernard J. Ebbers, suddenly looks
like a potential takeover target itself.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts agreed Tuesday that with its $129 billion merger
with Sprint Corp. in trouble, WorldCom suddenly looks attractive.
Indeed, some of the same companies cited as possible suitors for
Sprint may well take a look at WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both WorldCom and Sprint would be put in play, and we believe
the large European operators which are trading at premium'' prices
would act quickly to make an offer while their stock prices are
high, Eric Strumingher, telecommunications analyst with
PaineWebber, predicted last week as trouble brewed for the deal.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, WorldCom remained mum Tuesday after the Department
of Justice announced its lawsuit to block the merger. Separately,
the two companies withdrew their merger application before the
European Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``WorldCom will promptly review its options with Sprint,''
according to a statement by WorldCom General Counsel Michael
Salsbury.
</P>
<P>
   While a quick takeover of WorldCom is unlikely, some analysts
said a final collapse of the proposed merger with Sprint might make
WorldCom rethink its direction.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom must figure out if it can find another company to buy
that would provide the wireless operation it does not have. Another
option would be to back out of residential communications and
concentrate on the more lucrative corporate business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be the first to say WorldCom has been searching for a
wireless strategy and may not be able to pull that off,'' said John
Kwoka, professor of economics at George Washington University.
Having failed to earlier buy wireless provider Nextel and now
Sprint, they might give up on residential all together, Kwoka said.
</P>
<P>
   The question then becomes what would happen if WorldCom sold off
its residential long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feds wanted three viable competitors. That's why they
blocked the Sprint//WorldCom deal,'' Kwoka said. ``But would
(WorldCom's) business end up in the hands of a strong enough player
to preserve that competition?''
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent, WorldCom faces problems of its own making.
Ebbers molded the company by buying up about 75 other companies,
eliminating potential competitors in long distance and Internet
services all along the way.
</P>
<P>
   For the immediate future, the consolidation of Sprint and
WorldCom would have left business and home telephone long-distance
users with only two viable choices. It also would have given
WorldCom a huge concentration in the telephone lines carrying
Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``In each business sector that has featured a great deal of
consolidation, the next deal that goes through the pipeline gets a
closer look and faces greater problems,'' said William Kovacic, a
law professor at George Washington University Law School. ``That is
particularly true where the number of suppliers falls from four to
three, or three to two.''
</P>
<P>
   The WorldCom deal also was proposed at a time that regulators
have been re-evaluating some of their earlier approvals for
missteps. Regulators have been assessing whether previous efforts
to keep competition alive by making companies sell off some of
their merged operations had the intended affect.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Trade Commission Chairman Robert Pitofsky made the
observation in February that the government was not justified in
repeating a mistake if an earlier restructuring failed to provide
adequate competition. Speaking about an FTC study, he said the
agency found when companies divested some of their business
operations, ostensibly to preserve competition, they sometimes
picked weak buyers and then undermined them.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mario Monti, chief antitrust regulator for the European
Union, said an earlier WorldCom deal had left a sour taste in the
mouth of European regulators.
</P>
<P>
   When WorldCom and MCI merged in 1998, the merging companies
agreed to sell MCI's Internet business to Britain-based Cable &AMP;
Wireless Inc. for $1.75 billion, along with the customer contracts,
employees, assets and services that would allow it to replace MCI
as a competitor in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Cable &AMP; Wireless later sued, alleging WorldCom failed to
transfer all its customers, customer information and personnel, and
failed to provide all the services and support to operate the
business. WorldCom settled the lawsuit for $200 million in March.
</P>
<P>
   The spoiling of the Sprint and WorldCom deal also comes at a
time when the heat of enthusiasm seems to be dissipating on media
mergers. Two major media mergers now under attack are America
Online with Time Warner and AT&AMP;T with MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups have urged the U.S. government and the Europeans
to investigate the deals more closely. The European Union last week
said it would spend the next four months giving the America Online
and Time Warner merger a going over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's ironic that while the U.S. went twice to save the
Europeans (in the world wars) that the EU is now coming to save our
Internet,'' said Jeff Chester with the Center for Media Education,
which has urged European Union review. The center is a consumer
organization promoting competition on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the tide is turning against massive
consolidation but I think it is no longer business as usual.
Regulators realize that what they are deciding upon is the future
of the Internet.''

POSSIBILITY OF SHAREHOLDER LAWSUITS LOOMS FOR SPRINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER and DAN MARGOLIES  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The final collapse of WorldCom Inc.'s bid to
buy Sprint Corp., if and when it comes, could spark shareholder
lawsuits and an exodus of managers at the Westwood, Kan., company,
both linked to the accelerated vesting of employee stock options.
</P>
<P>
   When Sprint shareholders approved the WorldCom deal April 28,
they also approved a provision that immediately vested stock
options worth as much as $1.7 billion to Sprint executives and
employees, even if WorldCom never completed the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   What was unusual in Sprint's case was that the benefit, which
would have otherwise taken employees years to accrue, occurred when
shareholders approved the merger in April, rather than when the
deal actually went through.
</P>
<P>
   It was also unusual that in a deal of this magnitude and
complexity, in which regulators had obvious antitrust concerns,
shareholders voted before such concerns were resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that provision is uncommon,'' said lawyer Vickie
Westerhaus of Shook Hardy &AMP; Bacon, who deals with mergers and
acquisitions and securities law. ``It's entirely possible
shareholders would be concerned about that.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Richard Devlin, Sprint's general counsel, acknowledged
Tuesday that Sprint could face shareholder lawsuits over the issue,
but said its exposure was minimal given the disclosure of options
vesting plans in the companies' merger proxy.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale for accelerating options is to give key executives
and employees _ possibly concerned about their jobs post-merger _
an incentive to help the deal proceed. Otherwise, the executives
and employees conceivably could help block a deal that benefits
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But in Sprint's case, the provision may have had the opposite
effect, turning the company's golden handcuffs into a golden
handshake.
</P>
<P>
   Already, five top managers at the company have jumped ship. They
are Kevin Brauer, president of national integrated services; Andrew
Sukawaty, president of Sprint PCS; Theodore Schell, senior vice
president of strategic planning; Thomas Weigman, senior vice
president of consumer market strategy and communications; and Paget
Alves, president of sales and sales support for Sprint Business.
</P>
<P>
   Brauer filed this week to sell about $30 million worth of Sprint
stock, much of which he accumulated as part of management stock
option plans. As much as $15 million of the value of his stock was
accelerated as a result of the merger vote by shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint Chief Executive William T. Esrey addressed the departures
in a note to employees, saying: ``You must be asking yourselves,
`Do they know something I don't?' and `Should I be worried?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I am disappointed that executives have chosen to
leave. Many are longtime friends, and all have contributed to make
Sprint successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Esrey went on to reassure employees that the company had a deep
pool of talent and was on the right path strategically. The
executives' choice to leave, he said, was driven by other
opportunities, a re-evaluation of their personal goals, and their
professional and financial success at Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, those choices, and the role of accelerated options
in them, could well become the target of shareholder lawsuits in
the wake of the merger's seeming collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If management takes the accelerated options and chooses to
walk away, that obviously could hurt the future and the value of
the company,'' Westerhaus said.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what shareholders of Northrop Grumman charged
when the company's proposed merger with Lockheed was scuttled after
regulators threatened to block the deal on antitrust grounds. Like
Sprint's, Northrop's stock options accelerated when shareholders
approved that merger, triggering $150 million to $160 million in
stock awards and payments to company executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We claimed they were unjustly enriched,'' said San Diego
lawyer Randall Baron, who represented the shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Wrobley, a corporate lawyer with Blackwell Sanders Peper
Martin, said he didn't think a shareholder suit alleging Sprint
failed to get the best possible deal for shareholders would get
very far. But Wrobley said the stock option provision might present
``a clear opportunity to question the economics of the vesting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's billions of dollars of options, obviously that's a
target,'' Wrobley said.
</P>
<P>
   The merger has already attracted lawsuits alleging that
shareholders had not been sufficiently informed about the deal ``in
a timely manner'' and that its terms had discouraged bidding by
other possible buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine the millions of dollars that were spent here _ on
investment bankers, lawyers, accountants and the like _ and
obviously if they couldn't even get past the staff report at the
Justice Department, you've got to think it was an ill-conceived
deal,'' said lawyer T. Bradley Manson, who represented plaintiffs
in one of the earlier lawsuits seeking to block the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Whether shareholders find the stock option provision another
reason to sue remains an open question. But given the amount of
money at issue and the litigious atmosphere that often surrounds
big mergers, experts say they'd be surprised if no lawsuits were
filed over the provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line in this case,'' Westerhaus said, ``is that you
had two major players here, operating in the same market, offering
many of the same products. So from the start everyone there had to
know they would be testing the limits with this merger. It's the
same type of situation as the Northrop case.''

U.S. ACTION DERAILS SPRINT-WORLDCOM MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER and KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ending months of speculation that the largest telecommunication
merger in history would fail regulatory scrutiny, the Department of
Justice on Tuesday sued to block WorldCom Inc.'s proposed $129
billion buyout of Sprint Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno and Joel I. Klein, assistant
attorney general of the Justice Department's antitrust division,
announced the lawsuit Tuesday morning in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Digging in their department's heels, Reno and Klein charged that
the merger would lead to diminished service, less innovation and
higher prices for millions of consumers and businesses, undermining
the competitive gains achieved since the breakup of the AT&AMP;T's
telephone monopoly in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   If the combination of the nation's second and third biggest long
distance companies was allowed to go forward, Reno said,
``consumers and businesses would pay the price because competition
would be reduced in many important telecommunications markets.''
</P>
<P>
   She cited a laundry list of examples in a 65-page lawsuit filed
Tuesday, including the prospect of higher prices for domestic and
international long distance, Internet services, private line, data
and custom network services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going from the Big Three telecom companies _ WorldCom, Sprint
and AT&AMP;T _ to the Big Two would be like giving customers the wrong
number,'' Reno said. ``We must continue to go forward toward
greater competition and greater innovation, not backward toward the
telecom monopoly of yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Though widely expected, the scope and vigor of regulators'
objections revealed the gaping chasm between the companies' public
statements that the deal was on track for regulatory approval by
fall, and regulators' less sanguine analysis of the deal's
implications.
</P>
<P>
   Based on statements Tuesday, the companies have made no headway
in convincing regulators that the deal was pro-competitive, or
necessary to head off emerging competitive forces in the cable and
local telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This announcement, as well as the stances and actions taken by
Justice throughout the merger process, has left me frustrated and
disappointed,'' wrote Sprint Chairman William T. Esrey, in a letter
to employees. He was not available for further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is by far the largest that Justice has sought to
block, and the decision to go forward with a suit stands in
contrast to the other telecommunications mega-mergers that have
passed muster in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom and Sprint, the largest private-sector employer in the
Kansas City, Mo., area, said they would be reviewing their options
with Justice over the next few days. But they withdrew their merger
application in Europe on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The companies can fight Justice's suit, and under their merger
agreement they are obligated to do so unless they mutually agree to
terminate the deal. Given the time and uncertain outcome of
fighting the case, handling appeals, then getting necessary
approvals from the European Commission and the Federal
Communications Commission, most observers think the likelihood of
resurrecting this merger in another form is almost nil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's likely this merger is over,'' said Mel Marten, a
telecommunications analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis. ``Both
companies will be seeking other alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   William E. Kennard, who is chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission, backed Justice's lawsuit Tuesday in a
two-paragraph statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I applaud today's action by the Department of Justice to
preserve competition and protect consumers,'' Kennard said. ``In my
view, American consumers are better served if these companies
continue to compete rather than combine.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of the WorldCom merger, Sprint will likely be
looking to fill the void in its available services through another
merger, adding international reach through a combination with a
foreign carrier like Deutsche Telekom, or connections to local
consumers through a domestic partner like BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the company will be trying to stem the
defection of senior managers, who have already seen their stock
options vest as a result of the shareholder vote approving the
merger, and have little incentive to stay with the company in a
period of upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprint has a telecom headhunter bulls-eye all over it,'' said
Scott Cleland, an analyst with the Precursor Group in Washington,
D.C. ``Every telecom headhunter has Sprint as target one.''
</P>
<P>
   While WorldCom officials refused to comment in detail on
Justice's suit, senior executives at Sprint expressed amazement
with regulators' inflexibility and lack of responsiveness during
their nearly nine-month investigation.
</P>
<P>
   They also professed to be astonished with the concessions
regulators reportedly demanded to approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did regulators insist that Sprint sell its entire long
distance and Internet businesses to assuage competitive concerns,
but also its local telephone business, which operates in 18 states
across the country, Sprint said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea why,'' said J. Richard Devlin, Sprint's general
counsel. ``The DOJ has always asserted that stand-alone long
distance is a discrete antitrust market. All of the sudden
requiring us to sell local implies they don't even believe their
own theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Devlin said the problem all along was getting feedback from
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very much a one way process,'' he said. ``Despite
efforts to draw the department out, we were in the dark trying to
understand body language and signals, and frankly, the appearance
of caring.''
</P>
<P>
   Esrey, in his letter to employees, said that the divestitures
required ``were clearly unacceptable and not in our best
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Esrey said he was vexed MORE

   ...not in our best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Esrey said he was vexed by regulators' apparent fixation on
market share information from 1998, and lack of focus on where the
industry was headed in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only draw the conclusion that the Justice Department has
either missed or discounted the changes occurring in the
communications industry,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the investigation the companies said they
provided more than 3,670 boxes of documents, numerous CD-ROMs and
4,209 pages of answers and responses to more than 10 informal
requests for information from regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives, including Esrey, also made more than 25
detailed presentations to regulators in an effort to explain their
business.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, they said the Department of Justice declined to
engage in any discussion of the basis for its conclusions, refusing
even to share the economic models it used to calculate the mergers
effect on long distance pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Klein declined to discuss any talks the companies had with the
department to resolve the competitive concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my position has always been that a negotiated
resolution, a settlement between the parties in all matters, is
preferable to litigation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' he said, ``there is no resolution that the parties
have proposed to us that addresses the full range of competitive
concerns at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein said the lawsuit does not signal similar reluctance to
approve other mergers down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it signals is what it's always signaled _ that the
department takes these cases one at a time...,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   Devlin called the Justice's lawsuit ``a kitchen sink kind of
complaint'' that left the impression of a complex and convoluted
case that would take a judge forever to work through.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality it's a pretty simple case,'' Devlin said. ``It's
about three things: recognizing marketplace realities, looking
forward instead of backwards and protecting consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were more skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't a tactical issue, it was a strategic mistake of
thinking long-standing antitrust boundaries no longer applied in
the new economy,'' said Cleland, the analyst. ``When you go from
three to two competitors in a market, the government is more
concerned about consumers than shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the mergers apparent demise met with mixed reaction
among Sprint's roughly 20,000 employees in the Kansas City area.
Some were concerned that it would lead to further uncertainty, and
undermine the price of Sprint shares, lowering their net worth.
</P>
<P>
   Other employees, many of whom uncomfortable with WorldCom as a
new parent from day one, felt like shouting for joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, it's quite a sight to see people popping up out
of their cubicles and giving high fives over the top of them,''
said one Sprint employee, who asked not to be identified for
reasons of job security.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's stock was down slightly in trading Tuesday. Most
analysts think it will drop into the mid 50s in the wake of a
failed merger.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Maria Kovacs, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott LLC,
downgraded Sprint's FON stock from ``accumulate'' to ``hold'' on
Tuesday, saying ``it's reasonable to expect a period of uncertainty
for Sprint in its entirety and for FON Group in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   Marten, the analyst at Edward Jones, said Sprint is likely to be
bought by another company, but questioned whether any company would
be willing to pay the $76 a share that WorldCom offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one else would have as great a cost savings and revenue
synergies,'' Marten said. ``Any new offers will be above the
current price but not as high as WorldCom's offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Ferrugia, an analyst with A.G. Edwards in St. Louis,
concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would have been one of the best possible transactions
that Sprint could have negotiated, which is why Bill Esrey chose it
in the first place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he feels Sprint is probably worth $70 a share and
will eventually wind up being part of a larger entity.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, most analysts point to Deutsche Telekom, Sprint's
former partner in the failed international venture, Global One, as
its most likely partner. The German giant is flush with cash from
recent asset sales, debt and stock offerings, and is intent on
acquiring a presence in the U.S. that includes an Internet and
wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   That makes Sprint, which owns the fastest-growing wireless
business in the U.S. and one of the top four Internet backbones in
the world, an appetizing target. Deutsche Telekom already owns 10
percent of the company dating from the Global One deal, and may be
ready to expand that stake.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Sommer, chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, recently left
no doubt about his company's interest in global expansion.
</P>
<P>
   A global telecommunications company ``needs to be equally footed
in Europe and the United States,'' Sommer said. ``If you look at
the market capitalization of Deutsche Telekom today versus any
American potential acquisition candidate, nobody is out of reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Other potential international suitors include France Telekom and
Nippon Telephone &AMP; Telegraph, although they are considered less
likely partners; the French because they are wrapped up in other
deals, the Japanese company because there are legal limits on its
ability to issue shares in an acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic front runner is BellSouth, whose $100 billion offer
for Sprint in October was topped by WorldCom. Buying Sprint would
add needed competitive muscle for the Atlanta-based regional bell
company, which has been absent from the acquisition spree among
fellow Ma Bell offspring Bell Atlantic and SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
   But BellSouth might need to outbid European suitors and would
face regulatory scrutiny, as it is still banned from offering long
distance services to its own customers.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts think a foreign buyer would be the best scenario
for local employees, as the new owner would have no presence in the
U.S. and little incentive to cut jobs. Still, analysts say the only
certainty for the time being is uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent telecommunications analyst in
Atlanta, ``Bill Esrey better put his fishing pole back in the
closet because he's going to be at the helm of Sprint for a while
longer.''

LIGHT RAIL WOULD HURT BUSINESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The forgotten constituency in the debate over
whether a light-rail mass transit system is a good idea for Kansas
City involves those whose livelihoods would be most affected by the
project.
</P>
<P>
   What of the Kansas Citians whose businesses would be adjacent to
a light-rail link's right of way?
</P>
<P>
   This question is rarely addressed, but always much on the minds
of community members such as Gregory B. Allen. Nearly four years
ago, when Allen was president of the Broadway Area Association, his
group issued a position paper questioning the wisdom of pursuing a
light-rail vision for Kansas City. Its thrust tried to focus
community attention on the discombobulation that construction and
operation would wreak on the affected business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughfares that are home to many businesses, the position
paper warned, ``would be drastically transformed by rail transit to
a use never before contemplated.'' Not only would the capacity for
vehicle traffic become drastically limited, but access to the
businesses and parking would be diminished.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, governments routinely pursue projects that
discombobulate neighborhoods in the name of progress and serving a
greater community good. In this case, however, it's difficult to
make the greater-good case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk to existing assets must be justified by benefits,''
the Broadway Area Association's brief noted, ``and the benefits
must be demonstrated with convincing and detailed data.''
</P>
<P>
   The association has since merged with the Westport Improvement
Association to form the Broadway-Westport Council, Allen said, but
the ``risk to existing assets'' is as significant a concern today
as it was in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When the latest initiative to revive the light-rail dream
surfaced, Allen was prompted to ask, ``How much tax base must we
isolate from left turns, convenient parking and reasonable access
before the would-be straphangers are satisfied? ... How much more
business will we run off to the suburbs before our urban hormones
are sated?''
</P>
<P>
   What is most remarkable about local light-rail advocates is
their willingness to concede to themselves the all-encompassing
rightness of their cause. It's as if no other interests exist
except those served by pursuit of their goal.
</P>
<P>
   Economic considerations are of no apparent concern, and the huge
amounts of money involved seem an abstraction. Cost-benefit
relationships, therefore, are unimportant. Nor do facts seem to
matter. While mass transit may serve a critical role in a few of
America's larger cities, it certainly seems a stretch to pretend
its expansion in scope here is vital to Kansas City's future
well-being. As one observer asked me recently: If justifiable
demand is there, why aren't local transit operations ordering more
buses?
</P>
<P>
   Advocates, nevertheless, rule the debate because they are vocal
and dedicated. Meanwhile, the voices of stakeholders such as Allen,
who has owned a business in midtown for 20 years, get drowned out,
which isn't a healthy thing. This column is an effort to balance
the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine anything more dangerous to the health of this
community,'' Allen recently wrote, ``than building two-track
railroads in exclusive rights of way down our leading commercial
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen.

TIGERS NIP YANKEES, 7-6 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The New York Yankees were considered a great team the
last time David Cone won a game, on April 28. They could enter
Chicago's Comiskey Park or play the Tigers, or just about any
American League team, and they were feared.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Cone won a game, the Yankees had a .650 winning
percentage. No one thought they would need Juan Gonzalez or Sammy
Sosa. They were favorites to repeat as World Series champions.
Chuck Knoblauch's throwing problems were dormant, their pitching
rotation was deep, the lineup considered potent.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been two months since Cone's last victory and the
Yankees are just three games over .500, after Cone collapsed in the
fifth inning, allowed five runs and blew a lead. The Yankees
(37-34) came back from a three-run deficit to tie the game in the
eighth, but lost to the Tigers, 7-6, in 11 innings, when Derek
Jeter's error set up the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera came out of the bullpen to pitch the 11th inning
for the Yankees, and Bobby Higginson led off with a single for
Detroit. Bernie Williams made a sliding catch on a looping fly ball
hit by Gonzalez, but when Shane Halter hit a ground ball to Jeter
at short with Higginson moving, the grounder skipped off Jeter's
glove, his 10th error this year. The ball rolled into short left
field, and Higginson took third.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees elected to play their middle infield back and try
for the double play, and when Robert Fick rolled a grounder toward
shortstop, Higginson hustled for the plate. Jeter threw home, to
catcher Chris Turner, who tried blocking Higginson but dropped the
ball. For an instant, the ball sat on the ground and Higginson
stood next to the plate, neither he nor Turner realizing the umpire
was waiting to make the call. Higginson jabbed a foot on the plate
quickly, barely beating Turner and ending the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are unconfident, nagged by injuries, playing badly.
They need a stimulant _ perhaps an emotional victory or a
regenerated rotation, or Sosa. In the last quarter of the season,
the Yankees are 15-25, a performance level that would translate
into 100 defeats over a full season.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez went hitless in four at-bats and was booed thickly in
his first game since the proposed trade that would have sent him to
the Yankees fell through. Cone made the All-Star team last year and
with two starts remaining before the All-Star break, his record is
1-6, and hasn't won in his last 10 starts. He had a great chance to
snap that streak on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored three runs in the fourth inning, the last two
runs on singles by Jose Vizcaino and Jeter. Cone had a good slider
and a decent fastball, 86-88 miles an hour, and although Tony Clark
homered to lead off the fourth, Cone pitched out of further trouble
in that inning. The Tigers were hitless in seven at-bats with
runners in scoring position in the first four innings, the
continuation of a recent trend for Cone; to that point, he had
allowed just two hits in opponents' last 23 at-bats with runners in
scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees filled the bases in the fifth inning with two hits
and a walk, and there was nobody out, before Ricky Ledee whiffed.
Then Turner, who has become Cone's personal catcher, hit a grounder
up the middle. Damion Easley dove to his right to intercept the
ball, flipped to shortstop Deivi Cruz for a force at second, and
Cruz turned and threw to first. It was easy to see, from a
distance, that Turner crossed first base before the ball arrived at
the bag. Television replays confirmed that he had clearly beaten
the throw, and the Yankees should have had another run.
</P>
<P>
   Except that Jeff Kellogg, the first base umpire, called Turner
out.
</P>
<P>
   Turner spun to the ground in disgust. Lee Mazzilli, the first
base coach, immediately charged Kellogg. Joe Torre, the Yankees'
manager, bumped through some irate players in his dugout and rushed
onto the field, arguing at length.
</P>
<P>
   Torre turned to leave, but as he did so, Coach Don Zimmer might
have yelled something from the bench, for Zimmer was ejected and
Torre resumed the quarrel, challenging Kellogg until he was
ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Four Yankees have been ejected this season _ all in the last
eight days _ as they have plummeted toward .500 and their
frustration has grown.
</P>
<P>
   But the lead was still two runs. Cone still was in control of
this game, at least until Luis Polonia, Brad Ausmus and Higginson
hit consecutive singles to open the fifth inning, Polonia scoring.
Jason Grimsley quickly jumped to his feet to warm up in the
Yankees' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Cone used his slider to whiff Gonzalez for the first out. But
after a walk to Tony Clark, Cone appeared to hang a split-fingered
fastball to Dean Palmer, who waited for it and destroyed it, far
over the wall, a grand slam. Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching
coach, threw a sunflower seed to the ground, frustrated, and he
went to the mound to end Cone's night.

STONEMAN: `IT SHOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The July 31 trading deadline is more than a month
away, but it's not too early for teams that consider themselves in
a pennant race to start looking to make moves.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the ongoing need all teams have for more pitching,
the Angels' holes are at shortstop and designated hitter. But
Angels general manager Bill Stoneman doesn't consider those areas
too deficient to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are good enough to do it,'' Stoneman said. ``It
should be good enough. We've been a pretty good team right from
opening day ... Usually, what help clubs look for first is
pitching. We've got guys at (Triple-A) Edmonton that ought to be
here, in terms of our depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Seth Etherton likely would be the first to get recalled if there
is a pitching need. He went 3-1 with a 4.98 ERA in six starts but
was sent down to make room on the roster for tonight's starter, Ken
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Offense hasn't been a problem, but in a best-case scenario, the
Angels would like more of a run-producer in the DH spot, someone
like the Orioles' Harold Baines. However, bringing in that type of
player would change the makeup of the roster overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, (Scott) Spiezio has some key hits for us (in the DH
spot),'' Stoneman said. ``Since we're going with 12 pitchers, his
ability to fill in at third or second has been important. We've got
to be careful when you start to toy with the makeup of your team.
If you bring in a guy that's a one-dimensional player and can't
play the field, you've got to consider that before you make a
move.''
</P>
<P>
   PERCIVAL IMPROVING: Closer Troy Percival is feeling good again
after experiencing stiffness in his upper back/neck area during the
weekend. He had a chiropractic adjustment Sunday to help alleviate
the problem, but Percival will never be 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being 100 percent is not a prerequisite,'' manager Mike
Scioscia said. ``If he's fresh and not stretched too far to alter
his effectiveness, he'll be out there ... He's never going to be a
perfect machine. He's a survivor and gets the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   SURGERY FOR DICKSON: Pitcher Jason Dickson had arthroscopic
surgery Tuesday, which revealed additional damage to the labrum in
his right shoulder. He will miss the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson had the same surgery in March of last year and missed
the entire 1999 season. He was 2-2 with a 6.11 ERA in six starts
this season. &QL;

GALAXY WILL SEE A MUCH DIFFERENT UNITED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The beast of the East, three-time MLS champion D.C. United, has
been tamed this season.
</P>
<P>
   There are a variety of reasons that United (4-10-4, 16 points)
remains the worst team in the league with more than half the season
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams have improved, while United has been plagued by
injuries and national team call-ups. The Galaxy (7-4-7, 28 points)
has been struggling as well, but its problems pale in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   When the Galaxy visits United tonight at RFK Stadium, Los
Angeles will be facing a depleted D.C. lineup. Two-time MLS MVP
Marco Etcheverry and striker Jaime Moreno are with Bolivia's
national team. U.S. national team players Carlos Llamosa and Ben
Olsen are out with injuries, as are prominent role players Clint
Peay, Antonio Otero and Judah Cooks.
</P>
<P>
   With the Galaxy coming off a heartbreaking 2-0 loss to Western
Division rival Kansas City last weekend, this is certainly welcome
news. You would think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even think about them, that's the concern of another
coach,'' said Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid. ``We've got our own
problems to work out. We're going through the same thing they are.
We have to dig ourself out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   United does have some reason for optimism. After a 1-9-1 start,
the MLS orchestrated a trade that brought Raul Diaz Arce back to
the team with whom he won titles in 1996 and '97.
</P>
<P>
   Since acquiring Diaz Arce, United is 3-1-3 and is coming off a
3-2 victory over Chicago last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy, meanwhile, has yet to show signs of improvement
since acquiring Mexican striker Luis Hernandez. After a 5-0-5
start, the team is 2-4-2 with Hernandez. And not only is Hernandez
without a goal or assist, fellow striker Cobi Jones hasn't scored
since April 15.
</P>
<P>
   But the Galaxy is staying loose. On a bus ride to practice
Monday, Hernandez drew a laugh when he leaned out the window,
banged his chest and screamed like Tarzan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's feeling more comfortable with his teammates and that's a
sign I've been waiting for,'' said Schmid. ``Luis and Cobi are
going to break the ice and start scoring again. But in the
meantime, we need to roll up our sleeves and go at it hard.'' &QL;

CLIPPERS FACE FAMILIAR DECISIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SEAN KEARNS  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Clippers are in a familiar position in late
June _ holding a top-five draft pick, entertaining trade offers and
waiting for a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into today's NBA Draft in Minneapolis, the Clippers
still had the third overall pick. But vice president of operations
Elgin Baylor spent most of Tuesday talking with several teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our phone lines have all been burning up in both directions
and we are taking a hard look at every angle,'' said Baylor. ``But
it would be completely premature to say any serious discussions
have taken place concerning a trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers have the third, 18th and 30th picks in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports that they were interested in getting a point
guard to replace Derek Anderson, a free agent, and a big forward to
replace Maurice Taylor, also a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   However, it appears unlikely they will make any deals prior to
the draft, thus leaving them to decide between Marcus Fizer or
Darius Miles.
</P>
<P>
   Miles is the most intriguing player available. He is lean and
agile at 6-foot-9 and 220 pounds, with good jumping ability and
quickness. Last year, he worked as a counselor at Michael Jordan's
summer camp in Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a little counselor game every night and he picked me
to be on his team every night,'' Miles said of Jordan, who has
publicly stated he would take Miles if Washington had the No.1
pick. He truly liked the kid's precocious behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ```Sometimes I'd probably just put my warm-up suit on, and not
even my jersey. Low teams need the lottery pick. They need players
that are going to make a difference. Like Vince Carter. He came in,
and three years later they made the playoffs. If you get a player
with a whole lot of potential, he can turn your franchise around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls have the No.4, 7 and 24 picks and the Orlando
Magic have No.5, 10 and 13. As an extra benefit, all three teams
have room to make a personnel move under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Reports had the Magic looking to trade up to the Clippers' No.3
spot to Miles, who was projected to go to the Bulls with the fourth
pick. The Magic would miss out on Miles at five.
</P>
<P>
   Even with most trade scenarios, the Clippers should end up with
Fizer, the 6-foot-8, 250-pound power forward from Iowa State. Fizer
would give the Clippers a lottery front line with center Michael
Olowokandi, 1998's top choice overall, and small forward Lamar
Odom, 1999's fourth overall pick.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been lukewarm about playing for the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Playing an undersized center much of the time at Iowa State,
Fizer averaged 22.8 points and 7.7 rebounds a game last year as a
junior.
</P>
<P>
   In workouts, Fizer felt he was able to better show his shooting
range and dribbling skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed them my ability to dribble and things I can do like
shoot an NBA 3-pointer,'' Fizer said.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor has not ruled out taking Miles with the third pick, but
the selection of the 6-foot-9 forward from East St. Louis High in
Illinois could mean a trade for the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some players with good upside but it will take some
time before you get these players where we want them to be,''
Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The one spot the Clippers won't be drafting today is head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor wanted a coach before the draft but that won't happen.
The Nets hired former Laker Byron Scott on Tuesday, leaving the
Clippers and the Indiana Pacer as the only teams without a coach.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second time in three years the Clippers are drafting
without a coach. In 1998, the Clippers drafted Olowokandi before
hiring Chris Ford. The top candidates are assistant coach Dennis
Johnson and Denver Nuggets assistant John Lucas. &QL;

HOUSE BACKS BILL TO OPEN CAMPAIGN RECORDS OF POLICY GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: The following is now the lead story on The New York Times
front page) 
By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted on Wednesday morning to require a
growing number of shadowy tax-exempt groups that raise and spend
unlimited amounts on political advocacy to disclose their donors
and spending, opening the way for the first major change in
campaign finance law in two decades.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising reversal, lawmakers approved a bill, 385-39,
that mirrors an amendment sponsored by Sen. John McCain that the
Senate endorsed this month. On substance and the numbers, there is
scant difference between the House and Senate versions, and
President Clinton supports the legislation. But the Senate must
still give the measure final approval, and the question remains
whether Senate Republican foes will try to block or postpone action
on the measure.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just three weeks ago, the House narrowly defeated virtually the
same bill after Republican leaders bowed to pressure from party
moderates and promised to bring an even broader campaign disclosure
bill to the floor by the July 4 recess if they voted against the
more narrow legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy backfired when organizations on the left and
right, from Common Cause to the National Right to Life Committee,
strongly objected to provisions in the leadership-backed bill that
would have forced them to disclose their contributors and
nonpolitical activities.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican leaders and their allies conceded they had
overreached and only reluctantly voted for the more targeted
measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a C-minus, not an A,'' said Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y.,
who wrote the leadership-backed bill. ``We just couldn't get it. It
had too many people with too many pieces that they hated.''
</P>
<P>
   But champions of tightening the nation's campaign finance laws,
who criticized the larger bill as unconstitutional and deliberately
punitive toward unions, hailed Wednesday morning's outcome as a
victory in closing a loophole created by elected officials and
interest groups under Section 527 of the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   ``This represents one small triumph of democracy over secrecy,''
said Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, who sponsored the measure that
the House rejected on June 9. ``Disclosure by secret 527 political
organizations is one modest reform we can still enact before this
year's election.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday morning's vote, 205 Democrats, 178 Republicans and
two independents voted for the measure; 39 Republicans voted
against.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert supported the bill, but Tom DeLay, the
House majority whip, opposed it, saying it violated First Amendment
free speech rights.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This so-called `reform' bill is in reality nothing more than a
last-ditch effort by the Democrats to protect their vulnerable
incumbent members from valid attacks on their positions and
beliefs,'' DeLay said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   If enacted, the campaign disclosure measure would be the first
change to campaign finance law since technical changes were made in
1979 to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974, which was passed
after the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's measure was adopted, 57-42, as an amendment to a
military budget bill. But the measure immediately faced a
constitutional challenge because experts said the amendment
amounted to a revenue measure because it involved possible changes
in the tax status of political groups. Under the Constitution, all
revenue bills must originate in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the measure say the question now is whether the
Senate Republican leadership, specifically Trent Lott, the majority
leader, will try to stall or block McCain's measure. The Senate
Finance Committee is to hold hearings on 527 groups on July 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the momentum, we have the policy, we have the votes,''
said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a group that
supports overhauling campaign finance law.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., expressed optimism that the House
and Senate votes on campaign disclosure could enhance prospects for
a ban that he and McCain support on unrestricted donations, called
soft money. But many political analysts say that clamping down on
527 groups does not translate into support for limits on soft
money.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of the new tax-exempt groups have cropped up in recent
years, exploited by nonprofit political organizations seeking to
avoid the donor disclosure rules and the contribution limits of
federal election law.
</P>
<P>
   These secretive groups are affiliated with causes across the
political spectrum, from the Sierra Club to groups with close ties
to Representative DeLay. They are allowed to raise money, buy
television and radio advertisements, conduct polling and other
political activities, without disclosure, so long as they do not
expressly advocate voting for a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The measure requires the 527 political organizations to follow
federal campaign law and file tax returns. They would have to
disclose any contributors who give more than $200, and report any
expenditures more than $500. Violators would have to pay a 35
percent tax on all contributions and expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican aides said that the measure would take effect
upon enactment, meaning it would cover at least part of this
election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased the House today voted to close the 527 loophole in
the tax code that allows money from any source to be spent in
American political campaigns without being disclosed to public
scrutiny,'' McCain said in a statement. ``I am very proud of the
members of the House who rejected partisan appeals to support a
sham reform.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wednesday morning's vote capped several days of contentious
meetings between House Republican leaders, Republican moderates and
McCain to reach a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders had sought to win approval for a bill that
passed the House Ways and Means Committee last week on a party-line
vote. Under that bill, organizations that spend more than $10,000
on political activities would have to disclose contributions of
$1,000 or more. Currently, there is no such requirement. The
legislation covered all Section 527 organizations.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay and other opponents of revamping campaign finance law have
argued for years that what is needed is more disclosure, not more
limits on fund-raising. But Democrats and many moderate Republicans
complained that the leadership's bill would apply to all sorts of
activities, not just those in election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   With bipartisan opposition growing to the broader bill,
Republican leaders conceded defeat and agreed to bring up the
measure dealing only with 527 groups. But they moved the bill to
the floor under procedures designed to speed along uncontentious
bills, like renaming post offices.
</P>
<P>
   The process, called the suspension calendar, allows for only 40
minutes of debate, no amendments and requires two-thirds vote for
approval, rather than a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some House conservatives threatened to vote against a
top priority of their leaders _ a separate bill to expand Medicare
to provide coverage for prescription drugs _ if Republican leaders
allowed the 527 bill to come to the floor at all.

GREATER STABILITY BRINGS TEST OF POLITICAL STATUS QUO
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  OAXACA, Mexico _ Romualdo Sanchez and his classmates are
sitting under a tree outside their college classroom, chatting
about everyday things _ graduation, jobs, romance, the hotly
contested national election.
<P>
   What's unusual is what they're not talking about _ guerrilla
warfare, assassinations, financial panic. Unusual because until
just a few years ago, masked guerrillas prowled the campus of the
Benito Juarez Autonomous University of Oaxaca, holding rallies and
recruiting members for their cause.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Oaxaca was then a revolutionary hotbed in the midst
of a crisis-ridden country. The national economy was near collapse.
Ruling-party infighting left a trail of victims, with each scandal
more bizarre than the last. Mexico, in short, seemed ready to
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   No more. Mexico still has plenty of problems that make the
issues in the U.S. election seem tame by comparison. But the
convulsions that provoked headlines worldwide are fading memories.
The economy is booming, guerrilla movements have all but
disappeared and, except for drug-related killings on the U.S.
border, assassinations are rare.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, fear of change, the glue that has helped hold
together the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), is
diminishing throughout Mexico, and the party is facing the stiffest
challenge of its 71-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is especially clear in Oaxaca, and calls for change
can be heard on the streets and on the university's leafy plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is corrupt; it never follows through on its
promises,'' says Sanchez's girlfriend, Anita Leon, biting into
another stick of gum. ``There's too much injustice and poverty. We
need a change. It's been way too long. We're no longer afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   In the campaign leading up to Sunday's elections for president,
Congress and many local offices, ``change'' has become the
watchword nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the charge is Vicente Fox of an alliance headed by the
National Action Party (PAN). ``The choice is to continue with a
monopoly of power _ the longest-reigning one-party system on Earth
_ or achieve the much-awaited transition to democracy,'' he has
said over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Democratic Party of the Revolution
(PRD) is carrying the banner of change too. But Cardenas, whose
platform of leftist reform in two previous unsuccessful bids for
president sent shivers down the spines of bureaucrats and investors
from Mexico to Wall Street, is far behind in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Even Francisco Labastida, the PRI standard-bearer, has taken up
the cause, casting the party as the ``new PRI,'' a more democratic
version of itself, and promising that ``after the election we are
going to continue to transform the PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in previous campaigns, the desire for change this year is
propelled more by pragmatism than by ideology, and the contest is
over power more than policy. In general, the platforms of Labastida
and Fox differ merely in their details. Both candidates are
middle-of-the-road politicians who promise a more prosperous future
and a bigger piece of the pie for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida and Fox are in a statistical dead heat in most opinion
polls, with about one-fifth of the electorate still undecided. Many
of those still wavering, pollsters say, will make up their minds
based on how safe they feel.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, by U.S. standards, Oaxaca is still a turbulent
place. Sit-ins, taking local officials hostage, strikes _ all are
part of the in-your-face style of local politics. Compared to a
just few years ago, however, it has settled down enough to let more
voters feel safe.
</P>
<P>
   At the Oaxaca university campus and throughout Mexico, young
people are leaning toward the opposition, with their votes split
between Fox and Cardenas. Most polls show that among voters age 18
to 24, Fox has a double-digit lead over Cardenas, with Labastida
trailing in third place. Among those 26 to 30, Cardenas leads Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez says he'll vote for Cardenas; Leon, with an affectionate
pat on her boyfriend's arm, says she'll probably vote for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Young people form a crucial swing vote in what appears to be the
fairest and most competitive presidential race in Mexican history.
Nearly one-third of the country's voters are in their 20s, and
almost half are younger than 35.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox campaign has put young people in top roles and is
aggressively courting young voters. It has sponsored concerts with
the popular rock band Tri, while Fox himself, one of Mexico's most
eligible bachelors, often dresses in jeans and cowboy boots,
seeming much more vigorous than Labastida. Cardenas, while
remarkably wooden as a candidate, has added to his traditional
support from left-of-center students by featuring &LR;   &LR; using TV ads
and posters showing a young couple in a passionate, open-mouthed
kiss under the slogan, ``We want to dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Young people ``are a key factor that is moving the election
toward the opposition,'' said Daniel Lund, president of the polling
firm MUND. ``They are the first group to break with the PRI's
traditional methods of guaranteeing control, so they are less
afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the status quo looks solid indeed:
</P>
<P>
   -- The economy has recovered dramatically after the 1994-97
economic crisis, which required a $50 billion, U.S.-led financial
package to save Mexico from collapse. Economic growth is now
averaging 5 percent, inflation has dropped to less than 10 percent,
government finances are healthy, and the peso is solid.
</P>
<P>
   -- Guerrilla warfare is virtually a thing of the past. The
Zapatistas in Chiapas state, to the east of Oaxaca, have been
bottled up in their jungle hideouts by the Mexican army since their
1994 uprising. The People's Revolutionary Army (EPR), which stunned
Oaxaca and other southern states with a bloody series of attacks in
1997, has divided into factions, and many of its members have
silently abandoned armed struggle and joined the PRD.
</P>
<P>
   -- Unrest by students and teachers has fizzled. A chaotic,
10-month strike at the National University in Mexico City initially
enjoyed wide support but lost steam and was crushed by police in
February after the strike leadership was taken over by a tiny group
of ultraradicals. Earlier this month, schoolteachers gave up a
nationwide strike when public opinion swung heavily against them.
</P>
<P>
   -- Although discontent among indigenous groups simmers
elsewhere, it has been reduced in Oaxaca because of reforms by the
PRI-run state government in 1995 and 1998 that allow
Indian-dominated towns to operate their local governments with
``uses and customs,'' a consensus-oriented, traditional Indian
system of governing.
</P>
<P>
   -- The political process has been reformed, opposition parties
have more public funds and, for the first time, federal elections
will be run by an independent body, the Federal Electoral
Institute, rather than by the PRI-dominated government.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Improvements Aid Opposition
</P>
<P>
   For poll-takers and election watchers in Mexico and the United
States, the opposition's rise at this juncture is ironic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI is suffering from the Al Gore problem,'' said Eric
Olson, a Mexico policy expert at the Washington Office on Latin
America, a liberal think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy looks to be doing well, the guerrillas are off the
map, yet polls say 60 percent don't support the PRI. It's the same
as with Gore _ considering the economy, they should be 20 points
ahead. But Fox and Cardenas have tapped into the public's desire
for change and have succeeded in making this election a referendum
on 71 years of power, not about what's going on today.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet because Fox and Cardenas are splitting the opposition vote,
the PRI still could eke out a victory with little more than 40
percent of the tally. For an answer to why the PRI remains strong
despite the desire for change sweeping the nation, take a stroll
into the bustling public market in downtown Oaxaca, and talk with
Romualdo Sanchez's mother, Gabriela.
</P>
<P>
   She and most of the market vendors are firm PRI supporters. They
are guided by the PRI-controlled union of vendors, which controls
nearly every aspect of the market's operations. The union is part
of the party's huge, well-oiled machinery that doles out favors
large and small to millions of Mexicans nationwide, guaranteeing a
steady flow of votes for PRI candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm loyal to the PRI because it's changing things for the
better,'' she said as she weighed vegetables for a customer. ``It
helps me and my family. Why should I turn my back on it?''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the PAN has won municipal elections in the
state capital and several other major cities in Oaxaca, but the
PRI's strong support among rural voters, union members and people
who receive government benefits _ such as the Progresa fund for
poor families or the Procampo subsidy program for farmers _ has
allowed the party to maintain power at the state government level.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders complain of a stacked deck. ``The PRI has
very strong control over lots of people because of its resources in
government,'' said Luis Andres Esteva, president of the Oaxaca PAN
chapter. ``The PRI's message is: `The PRI gives you all this, all
these government benefits, and what has the PAN or PRD given you?'
People feel like they owe the PRI their vote. Loyalty is a
deep-rooted trait among Oaxacans.''
</P>
<P>
   For these voters, Labastida's vision of safe change is
reassuring. ``Other candidates are advocating change without
strategy,'' he said at a recent rally in Oaxaca. ``They say that
everything that has been done in the past 70 years (under PRI rule)
is bad and must be thrown out. We will carry out change with
direction, change with strategy, change to improve conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   This sort of populist  &LR; rhetoric is a hit with many Oaxaca
residents. Like many Mexicans, Oaxacans say the country's good
times are less than advertised. Their complaints include:
</P>
<P>
   -- The nation's economic boom has largely sidestepped Oaxaca.
Most new jobs are found in the  &UR; maquiladoras,  &LR; or assembly plants,
in northern and central states. The Oaxaca state government has
tried to coax export firms to set up  &UR; maquiladoras &LR;  in Oaxaca, but
with little luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We complain, we complain, we tear our hair, but the Oaxaca
economy remains marginalized from macroeconomic growth,'' said
Carlos Guzman, president of the state chamber of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   -- Many smaller businesses have been hurt by cheaper foreign
goods flowing into Mexico from the United States under the North
American Free Trade Agreement, and laid-off workers have little
choice but to emigrate northward to survive. In a nationwide survey
in May  &LR; last month by the GEA polling firm, only 18 percent of
respondents said their wages had improved since 1994 when President
Ernesto Zedillo took office, 56 percent said they were unchanged
and 26 percent said their wages had worsened.
</P>
<P>
   -- In remote rural areas, heavy-handed tactics by PRI strongmen,
the police and the army have maintained an atmosphere of fear and
coercion, human-rights groups say. Even in Oaxaca's charming
central square, dozens of Indians from the southern mountains have
created a squatter camp since 1997 to protest the jailing of at
least 86 peasants on subversion charges.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, this is the new face of Mexico _ still full of
grievances but more stable and more democratic than ever. Oaxaca is
willing to flex its political muscle, but, like an adolescent, it
is still a little unsure of itself and looking for a safe way to
leave the past behind.
</P>
<P>
   No matter who wins Sunday's election, ``everything is changing,
mostly for the better,'' said Gabriela Sanchez in the marketplace.
``It's for my son, you know, for all our children, and he wouldn't
have it any other way.''

COASTAL HOMES ON SHAKY GROUND SAYS U.S. REPORT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One in four of the nation's homes situated within 500 feet of
the ocean could be lost to erosion in the next 60 years, a
congressionally mandated report released Tuesday concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by the H. John Heinz III Center for Science,
Economics and the Environment, estimates that approximately 1,500
homes and the land that surrounds them will be lost to coastal
erosion each year for the next six decades.
</P>
<P>
   Although areas along the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico coast
are expected to be hardest hit, California accounts for a large
portion of the total property loss to erosion because of the high
value of coastal property.
</P>
<P>
   The center recommended that the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) produce maps detailing erosion risk so homeowners and
community officials could make sound zoning and development
decisions. FEMA already produces similar maps for flood risks.
</P>
<P>
   The result of a 1994 Congressional directive to FEMA to fund an
erosion-risk study, the report is based on a nationwide sampling of
11,000 buildings in 18 counties that are located within 500 feet of
the shore.
</P>
<P>
   The study concludes that property damage could be minimized and
coastal environmental quality improved by, among other options,
establishing development-free zones in areas prone to erosion.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that coastal properties face as much risk from
erosion damage _ caused by rising sea level, storms and large waves
_ as they do from flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report was based on data collected during the past 150
years,'' said Mary Margaret Walker, a spokeswoman for FEMA. ``So
given the dramatic predictions on sea level rise that we're seeing,
these (conclusions) are pretty conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the high-risk areas are on the Eastern Seaboard,
particularly the coastal zones of the southeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   But parts of California are also at high risk, particularly
Santa Cruz, San Mateo and San Diego counties. All have erodible
bluffs that support homes and commercial buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Monterey, San Luis Obispo and Ventura counties are also
contending with accelerating coastal erosion problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total estimated annual property loss (from erosion) for
the country is $530 million,'' said Bill Merrell, the president of
the Heinz Center and the project manager for the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``And California accounts for about $110 million of that
total,'' said Merrell. ``The problem is that you have very
expensive properties in coastal California, many of them located on
bluffs that are subjected to heavy surf.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrell also noted that erosion concerns in California have
resulted in an acceleration of ``armoring'' along the coast:
covering bluff faces with concrete, gunnite or rip-rap, a process
that can destroy beaches and block coastal access.
</P>
<P>
   Armoring has been attacked by the Sierra Club's coastal program
as one of the worst crises facing California's beaches.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to mapping erosion zones, the report also recommends
doubling federally subsidized flood-insurance rates for the
highest-risk zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The National Flood Insurance Program is supposed to be
self-supporting for homeowners, but it doesn't address damage to
community infrastructure that can occur (during erosion
incidents),'' said Merrell.
</P>
<P>
   And even homes covered by national flood insurance are not fully
protected, said Merrell. Of the $530 million in losses that are
claimed every year because of erosion, federal flood insurance
would pay only about $80 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said the onus of protecting coastal residents from
erosion is falling on all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is paying for this,'' she said. ``The fact is that
the erosion problem can't be solved by FEMA and the insurance
program alone. Coastal residents have to take some of the
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said the Heinz report is important `'because it gets the
information out there. It indicates (the limits) of responsible
development.''
</P>
<P>
   The report struck a sour chord with some groups, particularly
advocates of private property rights and local zoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't dispute that there should be smart development, and
we don't oppose buyouts for set-back zones as long as they're
voluntary,'' said Andy Lacy, the executive director of the American
Coastal Coalition, a lobbying group for coastal communities and
property owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the people who already live along the coasts aren't going
anywhere,'' Lacy said. ``This report is trying to scare them into
retreating, and that's not realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacy also opposes raising insurance rates in high-risk zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coastal property owners pay far more into the National Flood
Insurance Program than is paid out in claims,'' he said. ``The
insinuation that this is a subsidy to coastal residents is false.''
</P>

PRESBYTERIAN PANEL VOTES TO BAR MINISTERS FROM BLESSING
SAME-SEX  UNIONS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DON LATTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ After listening to hours of emotional
testimony, a Presbyterian church committee voted Tuesday to
prohibit its ministers and congregations from conducting ceremonies
that bless the relationships of same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's recommendation, which came on a 25-to-22 vote,
now goes before the entire General Assembly of the Presbyterian
Church (USA), which has gathered 558 voting delegates in Long Beach
to set national policy for the 2.5 million-member denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Presbyterian debate over same-sex blessings intensified last
month when the denomination's highest court ruled that pastors and
churches can perform the controversial ceremonies _ as long as they
are not patterned after traditional marriage vows.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's committee action approved a proposal by the Presbytery
of San Joaquin, a regional church body in California's Central
Valley. It seeks to amend the national church constitution and
flatly prohibit ``holy union'' ceremonies in all of the
denomination's 11,300 local churches.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, called an ``overture'' in Presbyterian parlance,
prompted hours of sometimes intimate testimony by witnesses and
those sitting on the 47-member committee designed to deal with
same-sex blessings.
</P>
<P>
   Committee membership at these annual church conventions is
chosen randomly by computer. That led delegate Daniel Stoepker of
Detroit, a gay man partly disabled by AIDS and cancer, to wonder if
it was just a coincidence that he found himself on a committee
hearing testimony on homosexuality and disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``God made me a gay man because he loved me,'' said Stoepker,
who credited his survival to the unconditional love shown by
members of his church. ``Jesus died for my sins, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally personal testimony was given by the Rev. Charles
Castles, pastor of Woodlake Presbyterian Church, the conservative
congregation southeast of Fresno that sponsored the San Joaquin
overture to outlaw same-sex blessings.
</P>
<P>
   Castles told a packed convention ballroom of the ``promiscuous
life'' he once lived and of his wife's involvement in a lesbian
relationship. Then, nearly 30 years ago, he said, they became
born-again Christians, and he became a Presbyterian pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Tuesday's debate centered around his overture. The
denomination, it said, already teaches that members should ``live
either in fidelity within the covenant of marriage between a man
and a woman or in chastity in singleness.'' His proposal seeks to
forbid all church officers or property from being used for ``any
ceremony or event that proposes blessings or gives approval'' for
any other kind of sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Castles was one of several speakers who said church sanctioning
of homosexual unions will set back the work of Presbyterian
missionaries abroad and make it harder for the denomination to
attract Koreans, Latinos, African Americans and other minorities to
its ethnic churches in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we approve same-sex unions, we harm our relations with
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on behalf of same-sex unions, the Rev. Tricia Dykers
Koenig, pastor of Noble Road Presbyterian Church in Cleveland
Heights, Ohio, urged the committee to adopt an overture that would
give local ministers the option to bless gay relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom of conscience is a valuable part of our tradition,''
she said. ``We should trust our pastors, not control them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the committee rejected Koenig's overture on a vote of 26 to
20.
</P>
<P>
   The entire Presbyterian convention is scheduled to vote Friday
afternoon on the committee's recommendation. If it passes, the
proposal to amend the church constitution then must be approved by
a majority of the 173 presbyteries across the country.

 AIDS EPIDEMIC DEVASTATING AFRICA  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The raging AIDS epidemic, which has killed 19 million people
around the globe, is devastating entire nations in Africa and
making human and economic chaos there inevitable, the United
Nations reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In some southern African nations, crops are going unharvested
because the epidemic has afflicted large numbers of agricultural
workers. Business and industrial output is also being disrupted
because AIDS is killing off major segments of the workforce.
</P>
<P>
   And many of the younger generation are being left without
education because the epidemic has taken a severe toll on teachers,
according to the U.N. report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AIDS toll in hard-hit countries is altering the economic
and social fabric of society,'' said Dr. Peter Piot, the
Belgian-born UNAIDS chief, in a telephone press conference from
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   ``HIV will kill more than one-third of the young adults in
countries where it has its firmest hold, yet the global response is
still just a fraction of what it could be. We need _ we must _
respond to this crisis on a massively different scale from what has
been done so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a whole generation that is being taken out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 130-page UNAIDS report released Tuesday is a grim analysis
of an epidemic that took the world by surprise when it was
discovered in 1981. It spread swiftly across every nation in the
world, but it has hit hardest by far in the developing nations of
sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The report was released in advance of the International AIDS
Conference in Durban, South Africa, next month.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year alone, HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, has
infected nearly 3 million people worldwide. More than 34 million
are living either with the infection or the disease itself, and 13
million children have been orphaned, according to the U.N. report.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in the international consortium known as UNAIDS are
hard-pressed to mobilize desperately poor and undermanned
health-care systems in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite intensive research into AIDS vaccines and major efforts
to distribute condoms widely in nations where unprotected sex is
common, it is impossible to predict when the plague's pace will
slow, the UNAIDS report said.
</P>
<P>
   And Piot warned that the toll ``is only going to get worse over
the coming years, even if today, by some miracle, all HIV
transmission would stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The center of the crisis is southern Africa, where in 17 nations
more than 10 percent of the population has been infected with HIV
and even the simplest of AIDS drugs are far too expensive for even
limited distribution.
</P>
<P>
   In seven of those nations, including South Africa, at least
one-fifth of the population is infected, the UNAIDS report said.
And the infection rate is at least three times greater among young
women than men.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are 15 years old in those countries today, the
probability that you will die of AIDS is over 50 percent,'' Piot
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the report's bleaker findings is the AIDS epidemic's
expected impact on education. Many of the younger generation are
being deprived of education because the epidemic has taken a severe
toll on teachers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The epidemic is undermining basic education in many parts of
Africa,'' Piot added. ``It's killing off teachers well before their
retirement age, and many households are forced to spend too much
money on health care, and have less money for school fees. We are
only at the beginning of the severe impact on society.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to allay the seemingly endless details of disaster, the
report did note a few bright spots:
</P>
<P>
   Countries whose governments recognized the epidemic's full force
early and began intensive prevention strategies, for example, have
begun to see stable _ or even falling _ infection rates. In some
countries where prevention efforts are strongest, evidence suggests
that young people are delaying their first sexual experiences,
having fewer sexual partners or using condoms regularly if they're
available.
</P>
<P>
   In Thailand, the report said, an anti-AIDS campaign has
persuaded most prostitutes to insist that their customers use
condoms, and Cambodia has begun a similar program. Up to
three-quarters of brothel patrons reported that they always use
condoms, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in Brazil, where four years ago fewer than 5 percent
of young men reported using a condom the first time they had sex,
the figure last year rose to 50 to 75 percent.

<P>
   ``Achievements like these keep hope alive by proving that the
world is not powerless against the epidemic,'' Piot said, ``but up
to now the gains have been scattered, not systematic.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of AIDS, Piot said, ``poverty is getting worse just as
the need for more resources to curb the spread of HIV and alleviate
the epidemic's impact on development is growing. It's time to make
the connection between debt relief and epidemic relief.''
</P>
<P>
   In virtually every nation in the developing world, the increased
demand for health care related to diseases caused by HIV is taxing
``over-stretched health services,'' the UNAIDS chief said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In countries from Thailand to Burundi, HIV-positive patients
are occupying 40 to 70 percent of the beds in big city hospitals.
And at the same time, the health sector is increasingly losing its
own human resources to AIDS,'' Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   The International conference in Durban next month is expected to
draw about 10,000 physicians, researchers, community activists and
other AIDS workers. They are gathering to report on results of
their efforts, to share their insights and to plan fresh attacks on
the epidemic.

DODGERS WAIVE HERSHISER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bob Daly considers himself a Dodgers fan, but as
Dodgers chief executive officer, watching Orel Hershiser pitch
Monday night was too disconcerting. Something had to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I watched him walk off the mound,'' Daly said, ``I said,
`That was the last time he'd pitch for the Los Angeles Dodgers.'''
</P>
<P>
   So on Tuesday afternoon, the Dodgers waived the 41-year-old
right-hander who Daly was instrumental in getting back this season.
He was a hero of the 1988 World Series. Now, he's gone, perhaps
having stayed too long. Eric Gagne took his roster spot and started
Tuesday against San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone was rooting for him, hoping it could
happen,'' Daly said. ``But after (Monday) night, we just couldn't
... We have an obligation to the fans and the other 24 men on the
ballclub. We've got a shot to be in the thick of things in
September.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser won the home opener April 14 against Cincinnati but
struggled since and was 1-5 with a 13.14 ERA at the time of his
release.
</P>
<P>
   He tried everything to find himself. He pitched in the bullpen
and even went to Single-A San Bernardino, where he was 1-0 with a
3.06 ERA in three starts.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't work. He was rocked for five runs and six hits in
four-plus innings June 16 against St. Louis, then threw just 26
pitches Saturday in St. Louis and gave up eight earned runs in 1
innings Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser also had hit 11 batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand and support the club's decision of giving me my
release after the way I performed,'' Hershiser said in a statement
released by the team. ``I am grateful that I was given the
opportunity to play for the Dodgers this season. I need a few days
to weigh these recent events and to spend time with my family and
friends in order to discuss my future.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser leaves as among the team leaders in ERA, starts,
strikeouts, innings, victories, complete games and shutouts. He
also won the 1988 Cy Young Award, NLCS MVP, World Series MVP and
broke Don Drysdale's 58-inning scoreless streak.
</P>
<P>
   He also overcame major shoulder surgery in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Dodger players were understandably saddened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rough couple of days,'' manager Davey Johnson
said. ``He's very special and he's a good friend. I love talking
baseball with him. ... This is not the way I had envisioned (the
end). It's emotional for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser is owed $2 million this season with a club option for
$2 million next season and a $500,000 buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser clears waivers Thursday. If a team claims him before
then, the Dodgers pay his salary. If no one claims him, he's a free
agent and can negotiate with any team, but the Dodgers still must
pay him.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, he hasn't retired, but privately, several people
wished he would.
</P>
<P>
   Daly said on the Dodger pregame radio show he told Hershiser he
should retire. Dodgers coach Rick Dempsey, a Hershiser teammate in
1988 said, ``I'm sure Orel will do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to explain, Dempsey said, ``Only Orel can answer
that. I can't go up to him and say, `It's time to retire.' Very few
guys are like Orel Hershiser, when they come back from so many
obstacles, they're the toughest guys to put the cleats down.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Hershiser decide to retire, Daly said he would talk to
Hershiser at the end of the season about a job in the organization,
but it depends on what Hershiser wants to do. Meanwhile, all posts
are filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, he has to decide to retire,'' Daly said. ``Then, what
does he want to do with his life? He's intelligent, and if he wants
to stay in baseball, is there a role? I don't know. Does he want to
coach? Manage? Be a broadcaster? Work in the front office?
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling is he'll take time off.'' &QL;

NBA CHAMPION LAKERS HAVE HOLES   TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The championship is in hand, so now the truth can
be told: The Lakers' title run was aided by a strong tailwind, plus
a smoke machine and enough mirrors to supply a carnival funhouse.
</P>
<P>
   They were too old at key positions. Too thin upfront. Too
unathletic. With too few shooters.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad for the league, Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and
consistent defense made all of that irrelevant as they rolled to
the championship.
</P>
<P>
   But repeating is another matter. And the Lakers will try to fill
in the holes once more, starting with today's draft (not much help)
and the free-agency market that opens July 1 (not much available).
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at what the apparent weaknesses of our basketball team
were, being a championship club, we felt we were able to hide those
things relatively well as a team,'' coach Phil Jackson said
Tuesday. ``We'd like to be a better rebounding team, to patrol the
lane and block penetration, to support Shaq and get him some rest,
etc. We need some big bodies that can give us some strength and
support on defense and rebound and play post-up defense.''
</P>
<P>
   None of which the Lakers are likely to find when they select
29th in the first round of the draft. It will be
best-available-player time, and as general manager Mitch Kupchak
noted, ``It's always tougher to find a good big man.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be the Lakers' only pick of the day Dallas acquired
their second-round pick in the A.C. Green trade last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Lakers might be looking to replace Green as well. The
team has until July 1 to exercise a one-year option on Green, or
let him become a free agent. They have a similar decision to make
on Ron Harper. With Glen Rice also becoming a free agent July 1,
three-fifths of the starting lineup is in flux.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials are mum on their intentions with regard to Green
and Rice _ though they appear ready to part with both.
</P>
<P>
   Green's production declined over the season, while Rice was an
awkward fit in Jackson's triangle offense and unsatisfied with his
role.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson prefers a more versatile small forward and recently was
quoted as saying he'd be ``surprised'' if Rice was still a Laker
next season. Jackson declined to elaborate on those feelings
Tuesday, saying, ``I think it's better left unsaid. ... We'll have
to wait and see how that plays out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson still covets former pupil Toni Kukoc, another free
agent, and the Lakers could try to acquire him from Philadelphia in
a dual sign-and-trade deal involving Rice.
</P>
<P>
   With respect to Harper, a Jackson favorite, the preference is
clear: ``He's in our plans for next year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron says if I ask him to come back and play, he'll come back
and play. I said Ron can do anything he wants to do. He's earned
it. If he wants to take up golf, fine. Some of it is, I think Ron
wants to play mid-January to the end of the season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson said if Harper decides not to retire, he expects
another full season out of him.
</P>
<P>
   The guard corps, in fact, might not change, barring a trade of
Derek Fisher. Fisher is under contract, and the Lakers would like
to re-sign Brian Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every intention of bringing Brian back,'' said
Jackson, adding he was ``comfortable enough'' with the backcourt,
despite some obvious concerns. Specifically, the age of Shaw (36)
and Harper (35), and the height of Fisher (6-foot-1).
</P>
<P>
   Although they need big bodies, the Lakers probably won't re-sign
backup center John Salley unless the need is still there come
September.
</P>
<P>
   Their last free agent is rookie guard John Celestand, who the
Lakers were ``intrigued by,'' and will try to re-sign, said
Kupchak.
</P>
<P>
   Teams cannot begin negotiating with free agents until July 1 and
are prohibited from actually consummating deals until Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Lakers will try to find help in today's
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, size is something we could use down the road,''
Kupchak said. ``I think A.C. did a wonderful job this year, but
he's 36 years old. For the bigger players in the league, it's
definitely tough for him to match up. Same thing for Robert
(Horry).''
</P>
<P>
   Both Jackson and Kupchak said the team needs to add some
athleticism, speed and jump shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's any kind of a secret,'' Kupchak said.
``And you can always use shooters when you have players like Kobe
and Shaquille.''
</P>
<P>
   But once again, today's draft probably won't address those
needs, leaving Jackson to paraphrase Mick Jagger.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't always get what you want,'' Jackson said.
``Hopefully, you get what you need in the process of putting a team
together.'' &QL;

IT'S TOUGH TO WATCH HERSHISER, GWYNN AT END OF LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ And so, Orel Hershiser faces the end. Sooner or
later it happens to all of them, to the best of them. Careers take
different twists and turns, find their own peaks and valleys, carve
unique paths through baseball history, but inevitably they all come
together in the same sad place.
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove the universality of it all, on the day Hershiser
was released by the Dodgers and resisted suggestions he retire,
fellow 40-something Tony Gwynn of the San Diego Padres underwent a
sixth knee surgery in a bid to prolong his career.
</P>
<P>
   At such moments you try to remember the good times.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in a dog-eared scorebook marked ``1985,'' are some of the
earliest and best of times. And here, on yellowing Daily News
sports pages from your first month on the Dodgers beat, pages your
mother saved.
</P>
<P>
   One week in April, 15 years ago now, Orel Hershiser faced the
Padres in consecutive starts. He pitched a two-hitter and a
one-hitter. Each time the no-hitter was broken up by Tony Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   On a Sunday afternoon in San Diego, Gwynn sliced a 2-and-1
curveball double down the right-field line leading off the seventh
inning. A good pitch, Hershiser said after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's the guy you want to break up a no-hitter _ the best
hitter in baseball,'' Hershiser said.
</P>
<P>
   On a Friday night at Dodger Stadium, Hershiser tried to jam his
nemesis with a fastball in the fourth inning but Gwynn got the
barrel of the bat on the pitch and grounded it into right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the guy's name that got the hit?'' Hershiser joked
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser was 26 years old then, working on a breakthrough, 19-3
season. Gwynn was 24, coming off the first of his eight batting
championships.
</P>
<P>
   The sports pages in those days were full of news of USC
basketball's signing of Hank Gathers and Bo Kimball, of the USFL's
fight for survival, of Rod Carew closing in on 3,000 hits, of the
Rams' efforts to trade Vince Ferragamo, and of the Lakers on their
way to an NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   Of the players in those games, only Hershiser and Gwynn remain.
Steve Garvey and Graig Nettles were Padres. Dave Dravecky was the
losing pitcher in both games. Mariano Duncan and Candy Maldonado
homered to account for the Dodgers' runs in the first game. Pedro
Guerrero doubled home Bill Russell and Al Oliver for the Dodgers'
runs in the second (though he might now claim not to have known
what he was doing).
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Gwynn was barely one-tenth of the way to 3,000
hits. In those days, Hershiser was not yet a Cy Young Award
pitcher, a World Series hero or a 200-game winner; it was still
vogue to joke about his wimpy name _ Orel Leonard Hershiser IV _
and physique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of Poindexter-looking,'' as Dodgers coach Rick Dempsey, a
player then, described him Tuesday. ``You looked at Orel, and you
didn't see `athlete' in him. Until he got out there on the mound.
Then you'd see what he can do with the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hershiser, the round-shouldered pitcher, and Gwynn, the
round-bellied hitter, the trips to the final crossroads have been
different indeed. Hershiser starred in the baseball towns of Los
Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Cleveland, made it to three
World Series, recorded the final out when the Dodgers beat the
Oakland Athletics in 1988. Gwynn played for one team, largely
wasted in the darkest corner of the baseball nation, batted .371 in
two World Series but never came close to a championship.
</P>
<P>
   But along the way they would be connected as two sides of the
same coin, their generation's leading craftsmen of the mound and
the batter's box. George Will would examine their preparations at
length and write in ``Men at Work'' that if everybody played the
game like Hershiser and Gwynn, nobody would be saying that its best
days are past.
</P>
<P>
   Will noted that on the night in September 1988 when Hershiser
ran his shutout-innings streak to 59, the ultimate measure of his
dominance was the fact he got Gwynn to ground to second four times.
</P>
<P>
   Now they cross paths again. Just not at Dodger Stadium, where
their teams were facing each other Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser had been at the stadium in the morning with his wife
Jamie, received the news of his release from Dodgers chairman Bob
Daly, and departed. Gwynn was in San Diego, undergoing arthroscopic
surgery on the left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Their immediate circumstances are different. Hershiser, 41,
apparently is healthy, yet he pitches as if he's washed up. Eight
Padres runs in the second inning Monday night left him 1-5 with a
13.14 ERA. Gwynn, 40, can still hit (.323 this season), yet the
knee wouldn't let him run the bases and play the outfield every
day. He is expected to be out until September.
</P>
<P>
   This brings them to same place, facing the same grim certainty:
Gwynn admitting last week that along with exploring medical
options, he is ``forced to think about retirement.'' Hershiser
hearing Daly implore him to retire and responding, ``I want to
think about what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point you are supposed to plead with them to end the
agony and just retire. You are supposed to remind them of Willie
Mays at the end, hanging on too long and hitting .211 for the 1973
New York Mets. You are supposed to suggest that each creaky step
somehow stomps out an ember of their glory days.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't work that way. The good times still exist in the
scorebook and on newsprint _ the days when Hershiser was becoming a
star although few thought he would, and Gwynn was hitting him
although nobody else could.
</P>
<P>
   If you remember them then, you think maybe these are the men who
can stare at retirement and make retirement blink. &QL;

USC'S SIMMONS FEELING BETTER AFTER SURGERY TO REMOVE TUMOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC defensive back Antuan Simmons is not expected
to play this season following severe complications from surgery to
remove a stomach tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, who is a preseason All-American and three-year starter,
has drifted in and out of intensive care following the operation at
USC's Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center on May 16, and has lost
approximately 40 pounds from his listed playing weight of 190. The
growth in his stomach was benign, but was lodged between his left
kidney and behind the abdominal lining.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a very difficult six-week period where Antuan
has undergone major surgery and we're proud of how he's battled it
and fought through it,'' said USC coach Paul Hackett. ``He's been
an inspiration. Thank God, he's coming out of it. They feel the
worst is behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been scheduled to leave the hospital on several
occasions, Simmons' physical condition has at times deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last weekend, Simmons was back in intensive care.
He needed a respirator to assist his breathing and had fluid in his
lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons is expected to remain hospitalized at least through the
end of this week, barring any unforeseen problems.
</P>
<P>
   Donald G. Skinner, the doctor who performed the surgery, has
told USC officials that Simmons should eventually play football
again.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-10 Simmons, who is a senior, has a redshirt year
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``They believe he can recover in time,'' Hackett said. ``He's
young and strong and will rebound. This is why you have the
redshirt year.''
</P>
<P>
   His absence opens up the left cornerback position, which is
considered the toughest in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said junior starter Kris Richard may move over to left
cornerback, or junior-college transfer Chris Cash and sophomore
Darrell Rideaux could have a chance to start at the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the role of Cash or Rideaux is expected to increase
significantly, as one will be starting when USC opens its season
Aug. 27 against Penn State in the Kickoff Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a three or four way battle for two spots,''
Hackett said. ``You can't replace (Antuan). We just have other guys
that will step up.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons was recently named a preseason All-American by Street
and Smith's magazine. Last season, he had 49 tackle, 10 pass
deflections, three interceptions, three blocked kicks, two fumble
recoveries and a forced fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons missed the final two games of the 1999 season after
undergoing surgery for a herniated disc in his back. That operation
also caused him to miss this year's spring practice. The stomach
tumor was detected after a follow-up exam on his back.
</P>
<P>
   In other football news, freshman offensive lineman Lucais MacKay
has decided to quit playing and concentrate on track, where he is a
discus thrower. MacKay, who finished sixth at the Pacific-10
Conference championships, will be placed on a track scholarship. &QL;

<P>
   SPINBALDAK, Afghanistan _ Bargain hunters, perhaps it is time to
consider a shopping trip to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, it is a shlep, requiring a journey across Iran or
over the rugged mountains of the Hindu Kush or through the steep
gorges of the Khyber Pass.
</P>
<P>
   But in a place called Spinbaldak _ in the flat, desert terrain
near the Pakistani border _ there are ever-so-cheap cars,
television sets, stereos and cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Entire stores carry nothing but motor oil from England or sewing
machines from Japan or wheel rims from just about anywhere. There
are great deals on Vaseline Hair Tonic and Palmolive Shampoo. For
those who prefer to buy in bulk, there are sets of 72 Duralex
French tumblers, 10-packs of Sony tape cassettes and bars of Lux
soap by the gross.
</P>
<P>
   Spinbaldak is like a Costco crossed with a Salvation Army Store
and a flea market. There are about 100 shops, each one spare and
decidedly inelegant. Most are merely open cargo containers _ 10
feet wide and 20 feet deep. There is no electricity. The climate
control seems stuck on the notch that calls for a dust storm.
</P>
<P>
   But service is friendly. ``Sprechen Sie Deutsch?'' called out
one merchant, Abdul Qadir. ``No? OK, I speak a little English, too.
And I give you the best deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, Qadir trades in television sets, which are banned
by the Taliban militia, rulers of most of the country. But his
customers are not Afghans. They are usually Pakistanis and Iranians
here to buy on the cheap for themselves or for resale back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you like?'' asked Qadir, a tall, persistent man standing
before two rows of televisions stacked eye-high, perhaps 70 in all.
``Samsung, Panasonic, Toshiba? Here look, I sell you a 29-inch Sony
for 10,000 rupees'' (about $200).
</P>
<P>
   There are some hitches to buying appliances in Spinbaldak, and
these became apparent as the sales pitch went on. ``I guarantee you
that 80 percent of my televisions work,'' Qadir said. ``And the
rest, easy to fix. No problem.''
</P>
<P>
   While the soap sold here is brand new, the appliances and cars
are all used. These are goods discarded by Japanese families and
gathered in large quantities by traders. They are then shipped to
Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and hauled into Afghanistan by
truck.
</P>
<P>
   The small-time merchants of Spinbaldak buy the wares by the
container-full, either on their own or with partners. They sell the
merchandise just as they bought it, unaware of whether it
functions. In this part of the world, repairs are cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, there was no shortage of customers, but the new
military government in Pakistan seems to be unusually serious about
collecting customs duties at the border.
</P>
<P>
   In Spinbaldak, a three-hour drive from any sizable city, this
surge in enforcement is a bother. More border guards means more
people who must be bribed. Customers pass a far longer gantlet of
open palms.
</P>
<P>
   These greedy men in uniforms can be avoided by employing a
smuggler. Men with donkeys will carry just about anything along
more discreet trails. But this does add to the buyer's expense,
about $60 extra on that $200 television purchase. At the same time,
the condition of an appliance is unlikely to improve while it is
strapped to the back of a donkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I show you a camera?'' asked Abdul Bari, whose shop is
more eclectic than the others, filled with hair dryers, clocks,
ashtrays, motorcycle helmets and toaster ovens.
</P>
<P>
   He opened a large suitcase full of cameras, displayed in a heap
like ties at an end-of-the-season sale. ``For Nikon, I usually
charge more,'' he said amiably. ``But for you, my friend, the price
is the same, and I will give you one that will work for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the way, Gul Khan was selling sewing machines. By his
guess, 90 percent were broken. ``But you cannot go wrong,'' he
said. ``I'll sell you this machine for 250 rupees'' _ $5 _ ``and if
you are worried about spare parts, you can buy two more at the same
price.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban are popular here. Indeed, when they began their
conquest of the country in 1994 they received financial support
from big traders who wanted the highways cleared of brigands. The
Taliban have made travel in Afghanistan safe again, and they, in
turn, make a hefty sum taxing cross-country shipments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the Taliban, robbers would not only steal your vehicle,
they'd take your money and maybe even your clothes,'' said Amir
Muhammad, an auto dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad and his several associates run a car lot. The autos are
all used Japanese models. They were bought from traders in Dubai
who have a take-it-or-leave-it attitude. They allow the cars to be
started but not driven.
</P>
<P>
   He had a 1995 Toyota Land Cruiser on sale for a modest $5,600.
The interior was clean. The tires had treads. The engine operated
without a cough.
</P>
<P>
   But was it a good vehicle?
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad considered the question. ``If you want a cheap car,
this is the right place,'' he said bluntly. ``If you want a perfect
car, maybe you should go somewhere else.''
</P>

EDITORIAL: NEW YORK JOINS THE GUN SUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesay, June 28:
</P>
<P>
   In two important new cases, New York state and New York City
have filed lawsuits against gun manufacturers for injuries to their
citizens from unsafe and illegal weapons. Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer filed the first state lawsuit in the country on Monday with
a forceful new argument that gun makers are contributing to a
public nuisance by flooding the state with illegal firearms. Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's lawsuit against gun makers last week also lends
a powerful political voice to the gun control debate, since he is
the first Republican mayor to join more than 30 communities taking
the manufacturers to court. For that reason, Giuliani helps rob the
nation's gun makers of their expectation that the issue will go
away if more Republicans are elected this November.
</P>
<P>
   The city's lawsuit, unlike the state's, raises some concerns by
including the nation's largest handgun manufacturer, Smith &AMP;
Wesson, the only gun maker that has negotiated an important gun
control deal with the Clinton administration. The Smith &AMP; Wesson
settlement is not perfect, but it represents a brave move against
gun violence. The National Rifle Association has organized a
boycott against the company, and Smith &AMP; Wesson has tried to back
out of parts of its original agreement. But by lumping Smith &AMP;
Wesson with other gun makers, the city could inadvertently
discourage similar settlements by other manufacturers that might
conclude that there is no point in compromising if they are going
to be sued anyway. The city should work quickly to settle with
Smith &AMP; Wesson, making sure that the company honors the terms of
its original agreement with the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Filed in conjunction with the Center to Prevent Handgun
Violence, in Washington, the city's suit argues correctly that the
manufacturers have been negligent in marketing and distribution,
often saturating markets in states with weaker gun controls so that
weapons can more easily move into New York City, which has tougher
gun laws. The suit also accuses the gun makers of producing a
defective product missing crucial safety mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   The state's suit does not ask for damages, a good way of putting
extra pressure on other gun makers to negotiate a deal like Smith &AMP;
Wesson's with the federal government. Spitzer argues that the state
should be working more to change behavior than to collect dollars
and that his method would bring a speedier resolution. But these
bullies may not listen to reason unless they are threatened with
paying a hefty price.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits appear at an important time, when most
manufacturers are trying to get the courts and Congress to stop
local and state governments from rewarding Smith &AMP; Wesson with
contracts to provide guns for law enforcement. The state should
consider adding damages to its case. The city needs to subtract
Smith &AMP; Wesson from its case. Then both can focus more heat on the
less responsible gun makers.

MARINERS KEEP COOL, BEAT ANAHEIM FOR SEVENTH WIN IN ROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The temperature at game time was 89 degrees, so a
meltdown at Safeco Field wasn't out of the question Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The second-inning line: two run (RUN IS CQ), two snits, untold
glares.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim starting pitcher Tim Belcher was the first to let his
graying hair down. He lasted just 47 minutes and 47 pitches,
drawing an ejection after fiercely arguing a balk call. Initially a
peacemaker, Angels manager Mike Scioscia wasn't far behind, getting
tossed himself when all else failed.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the Mariners kept their cool.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the uncommon Seattle heat wave and all the
theatrics, the home club beat Anaheim 5-3 for its seventh
consecutive victory _ its longest such streak at Safeco and a
season-best by three games.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sele, who exactly a year earlier lost the last game played
in the Kingdome while with Texas, won the 79th hosted at Safeco.
The Mariners' off-season acquisition permitted three runs and five
hits in 61/3 innings, good enough for his team-high ninth victory
in 12 decisions. It was also the Poulsbo product's fifth victory in
six decisions at his new home park.
</P>
<P>
   Sele got plenty of backing from home runs by David Bell and Mike
Cameron, both leading off innings. Belcher's balk didn't hurt
either, plating a third run.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I love about that guy,'' Jay Buhner said of
Belcher, a former Mariners teammate. ``Right or wrong, Belch was a
pretty solid dude. He's got that fire. Sometimes it gets the best
of him. But I love to see that, letting people know what he thinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm curious to see what that locker looks like _ probably a
war zone. I'll get a damage report.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally a feisty type, Belcher came unglued in the second
inning after falling behind 3-0 and finding himself in a
first-and-third jam. In mid-windup, the pitcher faked a pickoff
move to third, then to first. Umpire Mike DiMuro signaled balk.
Belcher lost it.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander got in DiMuro's face. Scioscia, the former
Dodgers catcher, rushed onto the field and pushed his way between
the overheated Belcher and the arbiter. Belcher got tossed anyway _
obviously it was something he said. Not finished, the pitcher ran
around Scioscia and bumped the umpire from behind.
</P>
<P>
   Several nasty words later, Belcher and Scioscia retired to the
comfort of the visitors clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Television replays appeared to show the pitcher, with his first
move, step toward home rather than toward the base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the replay and it was close,'' a contrite Belcher
said in front of his locker cubicle, which was still in one piece.
``It's something you don't see called very often. You don't get it
called by the home-plate umpire.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cameron, at the plate at the time of the histrionics, ``It
was a balk. It's the first time I've even seen a balk. I don't know
what he got tossed for. I wasn't concerned. It was between him and
the umpire.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher admitted using a few expletives, but insisted that he
was a charmer otherwise with DiMuro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted an explanation. I came down off the mound and said I
wanted an explanation,'' he said. ``I said, `Let's go out to the
mound and show me where I stepped.' The next thing I know I was
thrown out.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, who played for Seattle's pennant-winning club in 1995,
wasn't long for this game from the start. He gave up a run in the
first inning on John Olerud's two-out single into the left-field
corner. Belcher allowed another on Bell's leadoff homer in the
second. The long ball was followed by a single, walk, fielder's
choice and the hotly debated balk.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners pushed across another run on Mark McLemore's
double-play grounder in the fourth and their final score on
Cameron's inning-opening homer in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim chipped away with Tim Salmon's RBI single in the third,
Mo Vaughn's thundering homer leading off the sixth and Darin
Erstad's RBI groundout in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn launched one with a thud off a window of the Hit It Here
Cafe in right field, freezing everyone and drawing quiet after he
made contact.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners got spotless relief. Arthur Rhodes retired all five
batters he faced and Kazuhiro Sasaki went 1-2-3 in the ninth for
his 15th save.
</P>
<P>
   By now, there was peace at Safeco.

DODGERS COME BACK TO BEAT PADRES, 5-4
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At 11 p.m. Tuesday night, Eric Gagne still didn't
know what happened to Orel Hershiser. All he knew was that the
Dodgers had come from behind to beat San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   It took home runs by Eric Karros, Dave Hansen and Todd Hundley,
plus Karros' RBI single in the 10th inning, to give the Dodgers a
5-4 victory in front of what was left of the 41,897 beach
towel-waving Dodger Stadium fans. The win snapped a five-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne was recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque before Tuesday's
game to replace Hershiser, who had been waived earlier in the day.
He gave up three runs and three hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sadness,'' Gagne said. ``I still don't know what
happened. What happened?''
</P>
<P>
   When told, Gagne said, ``Really? He's one of the greatest
pitchers I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers had to go about business and did so, but it took
until the seventh inning, and by then, San Diego had a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still sluggish with the bats,'' said Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson. ``With Hershiser and that whole thing, it's been a
grind. This really picked the whole team up.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros started the rally with a seventh-inning home run off
Padres starter Will Cunnane, himself having been recalled from
Triple-A Las Vegas on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley followed with a double, and Carlos Reyes relieved and
got two outs before giving up Hansen's game-tying pinch homer.
</P>
<P>
   This was Hansen's fourth homer of the season. All have come via
pinch-hits, and it was the 10th pinch homer of Hansen's career. He
has nine as a Dodger, tying him with John Frederick for the most in
franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   After San Diego regained the lead off Matt Herges in the bottom
of the eighth, Hundley tied the game in the bottom of the ninth
with a home run just inside the right-field foul pole off closer
Trevor Hoffman. It was Hoffman's third blown save this season.
</P>
<P>
   Karros finally won it in the 10th with a single to left off Matt
Whiteside (2-1) that scored Mark Grudzielanek, who doubled with one
out.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fetters (3-0) pitched a scoreless 10th for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been pretty interesting here in the Dodger locker room
through the years,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers hope Gagne can provide more interest, since he's the
one the Dodgers want to establish.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed Ryan Klesko's first-inning home run to left and Kevin
Nicholson's two-run broken-bat single to right in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   In every other inning, he pitched like the Dodgers hoped,
retiring seven straight in one stretch and the final six batters he
faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had, in my opinion, his best outing of the season,''
Hundley said. ``The home run was his only bad pitch. The two-run
single was a good pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Cunnane threw plenty of good pitches, too.
</P>
<P>
   Making his first start since May 20 at Atlanta and just his
second start since 1997, Cunnane had a three-hitter through six
innings, having pitched his way out of two jams.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up consecutive singles to Grudzielanek and Gary
Sheffield, but got Shawn Green to ground into a force play and
Karros to ground into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Cunnane put the same two batters on base with two
out but again got Green to ground out.
</P>
<P>
   But he lost his shutout bid when he gave up Karros' 22nd home
run of the season in the seventh. &QL;

ANGELS LOSE TEMPERS, GAME TO MARINERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Angels will go sweepless in Seattle, their 5-3
loss to the Mariners on Tuesday night in front of 32,051 at Safeco
Field in the series-opener ruining any hopes they might have had of
taking the first three games in a critical 10-game stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of getting a hot streak started, the Angels were just
hot, period, when emotions boiled over in the first of 10 games
against the Mariners and Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitcher Tim Belcher and manager Mike Scioscia were
ejected during a heated exchange with home-plate umpire Mike DiMuro
over a disputed balk call in the second inning. The Angels were
never able to recover and lost for the third time in their past
four games.
</P>
<P>
   They also fell a season-worst 6 games behind the AL West-leading
A's, and six games behind the second-place Mariners, who have won
seven in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher had already given up a run in the second inning on David
Bell's leadoff homer, and the Mariners had runners on first and
third with one out with Mike Cameron coming up.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher went into his stretch, set, faked to third, then whirled
and faked to first. DiMuro immediately called a balk, allowing Joe
Oliver to score from third and Rickey Henderson to take second
base.
</P>
<P>
   Replays showed DiMuro's ruling was correct _ Belcher stepped
more toward home than third during his fake pickoff throw, going
beyond the imaginary 45-degree line between home and third. But
Belcher charged DiMuro, who ejected Belcher almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   That got Belcher even more upset, and he was stopped by Scioscia
and first baseman Mo Vaughn from going after DiMuro. Belcher, from
a safe distance, continued to berate DiMuro while Scioscia did the
same. Scioscia eventually got tossed long after Belcher returned to
the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted an explanation,'' Belcher said. ``I even went so far
as to put my arm around him and say `You show me where I stepped.'
The next thing I know I'm getting thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably one job in baseball that's tougher than being a
pitcher, and that's an umpire. I respect the ones who do a good job
and have control of the game. Unfortunately, the ones who don't
have control have the thinnest skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia and Belcher both dispute the balk call, saying many
lefties cross that imaginary 45-degree line on their pickoff move
to first yet don't get called for a balk. But the balk call became
secondary to the ejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's really troubling,'' Scioscia said. ``I never got
an explanation why Tim Belcher got tossed from the ballgame.
Obviously there's a line you cross for getting tossed out of a
ballgame. Tim Belcher never crossed the line. It was very
disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMuro and the rest of the umpiring crew refused to comment
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   While having your starting pitcher thrown out in the second
inning normally isn't a good thing, Belcher certainly wasn't
pitching as well as he did in winning his previous two starts.
</P>
<P>
   He walked two and gave up an RBI single to John Olerud in the
first inning and was in trouble before being ejected in the second.
In 1 1/3 innings, he made 47 pitches and gave up three runs on
three hits with three walks.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fyhrie replaced Belcher (2-1) and retired the first five
batters he faced, including Cameron, Edgar Martinez and Jay Buhner
on strikeouts. But the Mariners got a couple of hits and a run in
the fourth inning, then got a home run from Cameron in the fifth to
take a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Fyrhie gave up two runs in 3 2/3 innings, and Lou Pote (two
innings) and Mark Petkovsek (one inning) combined to shut down the
Mariners for the final three innings. After the game, Pote was sent
to Triple-A Edmonton to make room on the roster for Ken Hill, who
will start tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen did a great job of picking me up,'' Belcher said.
``We're starting probably one of the biggest stretches of games,
one thing you don't want to have happen is lose your starting
pitcher in the second inning, no matter what the reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had trouble mounting much offense against Mariners
starter Aaron Sele. They got three consecutive two-out singles _
including Tim Salmon's RBI single _ in the third inning, and a solo
homer by Vaughn (No.21) in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Sele left the game with Adam Kennedy on second and one out in
the seventh. Kennedy scored later in the inning on Darin Erstad's
RBI groundout. Sele (9-3) gave up three runs and five hits in 6 1/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the second in a row for the Angels, who have not
lost more than three in a row all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to stay away from any prolonged losing streak or
any losing streak at all is a big plus, it's a sign of a good
team,'' Angels general manager Bill Stoneman said before the game.
``But another sign of a good team is putting a win streak together,
and we haven't done it yet.'' &QL;

 &HT;    MICROSOFT'S FUTURE WILL MOVE TO THE WEB
 &HT;    Moving in (a) national and (f) financial categories for release
Sunday, July 2.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ The Microsoft programmers butted each other
with their black plastic helmets, molded to look like the hair of
Japanese sumo wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   Clad in rubberized suits that made them look like jumbo pink
Michelin men, the programmers clashed, fell down and rolled around,
unable to get up again without help.
</P>
<P>
   The immobilized wrestlers symbolized Microsoft today _ its
powerful programming skills and enormous market power in danger of
being toppled and left helpless by a government antitrust action.
</P>
<P>
   But the court battle back in Washington hardly seems to have
registered here in the Seattle suburbs. Pressing ahead to make its
products more all-encompassing than ever, the company's high
command has adopted a vision built upon the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That approach is leaving the work of the Windows programmers
writhing on the outdoor mat a vestige of a passing era.
</P>
<P>
   In a stretch of 72-hour work weeks, the code writers had just
put the finishing touches on Windows Me, for ``millennial edition''
_ likely the last consumer product from the world's largest
software firm to regard the personal computer as largely a
stand-alone machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excellent work,'' a team leader said into a mike as the sumo
wrestlers' straw-hatted colleagues sipped beers to the music of a
steel band. ``Let's go party!''
</P>
<P>
   But the company's top brass shows scant enthusiasm for Windows
Me, a direct successor to DOS, which led Microsoft on a 25-year
march to riches. In a June 22 briefing for reporters and analysts
here, which focused on how Microsoft intends to reinvent itself as
an Internet powerhouse, Windows Me went unmentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows isn't going away,'' Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's chief
executive, told the gathering at the company's conference center.
But ``to take advantage of this future trend in technology, we need
this new 'dot-Net' platform,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's new business model remains a work in progress, but
the core idea is to view software as a service rather than as a
product, to be stored not on millions of personal computers but on
a Web server.
</P>
<P>
   The new platform relies on an open programming language known as
XML. It runs on any operating system and on any robust hardware
platform. It can be accessed by a host of devices, including
Web-enabled TV sets and cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is no pioneer in pursuing a service-based,
multi-device, Web-centric model for its software. Hewlett-Packard
began marketing its own Internet services platform, known as
e-speak, last December. IBM, Oracle and Sun Microsystems are also
players in this league, as well as host of smaller firms.
</P>
<P>
   But assuming the courts to do not raise insurmountable
roadblocks, Microsoft possesses potent assets to comete in this
market, including long-standing relationships with such key
business partners as Dell Computer Corp., 40,000 worldwide
employees and a $20 billion cash hoard.
</P>
<P>
   And software developers still recall how WordPerfect and Lotus
lost their onetime top billing in the word processor and
spreadsheet charts to Microsoft when they failed to adapt quickly
to the Windows standard.
</P>
<P>
   Another key facet of the makeover moves revenues from software
royalties and licenses to subscription fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at this,'' Microsoft chairman and co-founder Bill
Gates said in an interview, ``it's clear to me that 'p' (price)
cannot be the answer. The entire upside must be in 'v' (volume).''
</P>
<P>
   Gates's economic shorthand reflects less on his aborted Harvard
education than on the June 7 decision by U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson to split Microsoft's Windows monopoly from its Web
sites and from its software applications business, such as Office.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, the company has argued that it could not go
forward with the ``dot-Net'' initiative if Jackson's ruling stands.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews on the Microsoft campus with programmers and
mid-level managers, Jackson's draconian remedy also scarcely caused
a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I don't think about the case at all,''
said Jonathan Weinstein, who devises computing strategies for small
businesses aimed at dovetailing with the new ``dot-net'' agenda.

 &HT;    Cybercafes, Internet kiosks keep travelers connected
 &HT;    By Anne Meyers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My husband enjoys the ability to disconnect during a
vacation. Work and home are left behind so he can indulge in the
sheer enjoyment of the places we visit. The only exception is the
daily phone call to our kids.
</P>
<P>
   I like to vacation, but I never completely disconnect.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, our flight to Dublin, Ireland, stopped for a
two-hour layover in Shannon. The stopover was little more than an
invitation to spend our Irish currency.
</P>
<P>
   The terminal offered some food and a lot of tourist-friendly
merchandise. Green was the dominant color in the gift shop, but
across the hallway I could see a welcoming PINK.
</P>
<P>
   I had been away from my kids for less than 24 hours, and it was
1 a.m. where they were. I still felt the need to send them a note,
and there in the corner was PINK _ a public Internet kiosk
(www.isltd.com/pink.html). At the PINK machine, you can surf the
Internet and send and receive e-mail on its 14-inch LCD
touch-screen computer. The box is coin-operated.
</P>
<P>
   I bought a diet cola to break the paper money into coin and
headed for the PINK machine. Just as I approached, another traveler
informed us that the box was broken. I was disappointed, but knew
that I would soon find an old-fashioned cybercafe in Dublin with
plenty of working computers.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed since the days I called my parents' house
from the road and hung up after the first ring just to let them
know I was still alive. When I traveled 20 years ago, phone calls
cost over $1.50 per minute between the United Kingdom and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a prepaid calling card from a major long-distance
provider, I paid 18 cents per minute from London and 24 cents per
minute from Dublin. The card was purchased from Costco and may be
precharged with a credit card number via telephone. (The same card
purchased direct from the telephone company is nearly four times
the cost.)
</P>
<P>
   Since its introduction, public Internet access has also dropped
in cost. Three years ago, I paid approximately $5 per half-hour in
cybercafes and more at Internet kiosks. On this trip to Ireland,
England and Switzerland, we paid no more than $3.50 an hour.
Internet use was free with the purchase of a drink at some
cybercafes.
</P>
<P>
   This technology kept me in touch with family, friends and work.
With the ease of communication, I was able to enjoy my trip more. I
sent a few e-mails and never bothered with postcards.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I met up with friends from Atlanta while we were
in London. While the men made a stop at a local pub, my friend
Debbie and her kids joined me at a favorite cybercafe called
Webshack (www.webshack-cafe.com).
</P>
<P>
   Debbie's family shares an America Online account, and each of
them has a screen name. Webshack computers have AOL's software and
Instant Messenger. Katie, who is in high school, exchanged instant
messages with friends, while Joey, a middle-schooler, logged on via
AOL's Web site and checked his e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   They enjoyed the opportunity to connect with their friends. When
the men arrived from their taste of the local culture, Debbie's
husband Jim quickly checked his e-mail, and we ventured back into
London's trendy Soho. Jim regularly checked his work e-mail during
their trip.
</P>
<P>
   Webshack offers a high-speed connection so I can check mail,
read an online newspaper and surf miscellaneous Web sites at
lightning speed.
</P>
<P>
   New cybercafes are emerging regularly, and information is
available online. The Web site, www.netcafeguide.com
</P>
<P>
   /frames.html, offers information about 3,000 cybercafes in 139
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers who are computer-equipped need to know a different set
of rules. Check the Web site www.roadnews.com/ for important
information for laptop users who travel abroad. The site will help
with everything from finding a roaming Internet access provider and
resolving hardware and software issues to guarding against computer
theft.

daily phone call to our kids.
</P>
<P>
   I like to vacation, but I never completely disconnect.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, our flight to Dublin, Ireland, stopped for a
two-hour layover in Shannon. The stopover was little more than an
invitation to spend our Irish currency.
</P>
<P>
   The terminal offered some food and a lot of tourist-friendly
merchandise. Green was the dominant color in the gift shop, but
across the hallway I could see a welcoming PINK.
</P>
<P>
   I had been away from my kids for less than 24 hours, and it was
1 a.m. where they were. I still felt the need to send them a note,
and there in the corner was PINK _ a public Internet kiosk
(www.isltd.com/pink.html). At the PINK machine, you can surf the
Internet and send and receive e-mail on its 14-inch LCD
touch-screen computer. The box is coin-operated.
</P>
<P>
   I bought a diet cola to break the paper money into coin and
headed for the PINK machine. Just as I approached, another traveler
informed us that the box was broken. I was disappointed, but knew
that I would soon find an old-fashioned cybercafe in Dublin with
plenty of working computers.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed since the days I called my parents' house
from the road and hung up after the first ring just to let them
know I was still alive. When I traveled 20 years ago, phone calls
cost over $1.50 per minute between the United Kingdom and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a prepaid calling card from a major long-distance
provider, I paid 18 cents per minute from London and 24 cents per
minute from Dublin. The card was purchased from Costco and may be
precharged with a credit card number via telephone. (The same card
purchased direct from the telephone company is nearly four times
the cost.)
</P>
<P>
   Since its introduction, public Internet access has also dropped
in cost. Three years ago, I paid approximately $5 per half-hour in
cybercafes and more at Internet kiosks. On this trip to Ireland,
England and Switzerland, we paid no more than $3.50 an hour.
Internet use was free with the purchase of a drink at some
cybercafes.
</P>
<P>
   This technology kept me in touch with family, friends and work.
With the ease of communication, I was able to enjoy my trip more. I
sent a few e-mails and never bothered with postcards.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I met up with friends from Atlanta while we were
in London. While the men made a stop at a local pub, my friend
Debbie and her kids joined me at a favorite cybercafe called
Webshack (www.webshack-cafe.com).
</P>
<P>
   Debbie's family shares an America Online account, and each of
them has a screen name. Webshack computers have AOL's software and
Instant Messenger. Katie, who is in high school, exchanged instant
messages with friends, while Joey, a middle-schooler, logged on via
AOL's Web site and checked his e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   They enjoyed the opportunity to connect with their friends. When
the men arrived from their taste of the local culture, Debbie's
husband Jim quickly checked his e-mail, and we ventured back into
London's trendy Soho. Jim regularly checked his work e-mail during
their trip.
</P>
<P>
   Webshack offers a high-speed connection so I can check mail,
read an online newspaper and surf miscellaneous Web sites at
lightning speed.
</P>
<P>
   New cybercafes are emerging regularly, and information is
available online. The Web site, www.netcafeguide.com
</P>
<P>
   /frames.html, offers information about 3,000 cybercafes in 139
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers who are computer-equipped need to know a different set
of rules. Check the Web site www.roadnews.com/ for important
information for laptop users who travel abroad. The site will help
with everything from finding a roaming Internet access provider and
resolving hardware and software issues to guarding against computer
theft.

 &HT;    Spadea: At 21, skid was getting old
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ His parents had gone home to Boca Raton two
days earlier, probably in despair, Vince Spadea joked later.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent had virtually guaranteed his British fans a win in
the well-read pages of The Sun _ London's tabloid featuring
bare-topped Page3 girls and lots of Anna Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
   And few others had given him much chance to end his ATP
Tour-record 21-match losing streak against big-serving Greg
Rusedski, the 14th seed and a grass-court lover.
</P>
<P>
   But at 9p.m. Monday in London (4 p.m. EDT), Spadea lifted his
arms in victory to the few friends in his supporters box and to
himself. He had finally won.
</P>
<P>
   The streak was over, after months of losing, of working when it
seemed hopeless, of close losses and horrible losses, of injury, of
scrutiny. It was over, after three hours, 56 minutes of play and
nearly two hours of rain delay Monday at the All England Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm popping champagne like I won the tournament,'' Spadea said
later. ``I'm going to enjoy it, because that's what it's all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Spadea defeated Rusedski 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 6-7 (8-10), 9-7 on
Court1, which seats 11,429 and was filled with passionate British
fans waving signs and flags for Rusedski.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Spadea urged a partially booing crowd to give him
credit for a hard-fought match, even though he'd been a bit testy
during play. He won them over with a broad grin once they began
applauding. Davis Cup captain John McEnroe hugged him too _ so hard
Spadea said he felt ``like my kid was born or something. That was a
great feeling, man.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, he entered a near-empty interview room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am. Six months,'' Spadea said. ``It was worth the wait,
huh people?''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was his first since reaching the semifinals at Lyon
in October. He defeated Jim Courier, then Yevgeny Kafelnikov,
before losing to Lleyton Hewitt. Spadea tried not to lose faith in
himself during the streak, but the number finally got to him last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some girl in a bar asked me how old I was and I told her 21
because I've got that number in my mind, all over my brain,'' said
Spadea, 25, laughing after finishing most of his media obligations
at about 11p.m. He hadn't yet called his parents but wished they
had been here after all they've put into his career over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one became his number after Spadea lost to Sebastien
Grosjean last week. That loss broke an ATP record held by Gary
Donnelly, a Phoenix doubles specialist who lost 20 straight from
November 1996 to September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Spadea said he thought about his streak just once while playing
Rusedski and admitted to himself then that losing this match _
after failing to convert two set points in the second set and two
match points in both the fourth and fifth sets _ would be ``very
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But the streak hasn't haunted him daily, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rough patch in my life in tennis,'' Spadea said.
``It didn't really faze me so much. I was trying to enjoy my life a
little more, trying to improve my tennis game. Everything wasn't
clicking.''
</P>
<P>
   He kept going to the gym, brought on former Australian star Pat
Cash to help his game, kept playing and kept trying to improve upon
his career-high No.19 ranking, where he finished 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't playing poorly,'' he said. ``I had a great year last
year, but I needed to add some things to get to even a further
level. I just wasn't sure how to do it. I wasn't that organized.
It's hard to improve, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   And when he saw his Wimbledon draw, he wasn't encouraged,
despite his usual good results against top players in big
tournaments. He suspected television and fans would be watching
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to put a microscope on me,'' Spadea said.
``With a guy who is a great grass-court player, and my record on
grass, it just made it so much more adverse.''
</P>
<P>
   But he endured, after he and Rusedski fought like gladiators, as
he put it.
</P>
<P>
   Spadea credited Cash, who has been helping him informally since
his first-round loss at the French Open. Spadea came straight to
London and started working on grass, particularly on approaching
the net, playing more aggressively and believing in himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been very generous,'' Spadea said. ``It's been an amazing
experience to work with someone of that stature. He's definitely
changed my outlook on grass-court tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   And the victory can't hurt any of that, particularly the way it
came.
</P>
<P>
   Rusedski, despite his column in The Sun, hinted at a foot injury
that has been hampering him but wouldn't elaborate and credited
Spadea.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played well,'' said Rusedski, adding that he plans to
escape tennis for several days now. ``I didn't take my
opportunities when I had them. He's too good a player to lose as
many matches as he lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Spadea couldn't agree more and said he's curious to see how a
victory feels this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even analyzing the monkey that I had on my back,'' he
said. ``I'm just focused on the fact that this will be a great
memory, no matter what happened to me this year.''

 &HT;    Concrete gorilla boasts face of George W. Bush, moves of Al Gore
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apparently it's just a silly coincidence that the 3,600-pound
concrete gorilla made and marketed by Double D Statuary looks like
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody who had access to do something like that
is that artistically inclined,'' said Kevin Barker, manager of
Double D's outlet yard on Interstate 35 between Temple and Waco,
Texas. He said the gorilla is made from a mold, so there may be
countless concrete gorillas out there from Double D that look like
the governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the gorillas come out of the exact same mold, so they're
all going to have to look very, very similar,'' he said. Barker
added he was not aware that the $660 gorilla looks like Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A reader of my book ``Texas Curiosities'' pointed out the eerie
resemblance between Bush and the life-size yard gorilla. The
concrete gorilla on Page 20 of the book is the spitting image of
the Republican presidential candidate, the reader noticed. I took
the picture of the gorilla, and I hadn't even notice-- .
</P>
<P>
   If Bush gets a presidential library, I wonder how long it'll be
before some wise guy leaves one of these gorillas on the front lawn
at night. Let me add that although the gorilla does not look like
Al Gore, it has Gore's moves. Actually, it may be a little quicker
than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But the gorilla really does look like Bush. Don't take my word
for it. Check out the pictures of these two characters who appear
to have been separated at birth.
</P>
<P>
   Really, the look on the gorilla's face is the same one you get
when you ask Bush to name the capital of Outer Slobovia.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's the eyes that make them look so much alike. There
is that intensity in the gorilla's eyes that you see on Bush when
he appears to be deep in thought, assuming this occurs. It's the
pre-smirk look that the gorilla is giving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I going to get national attention out of this?'' Barker
asked. ``Maybe I can be vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Kevin. The gorilla gets to be vice president, and you're
chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Double D also makes hippos, rhinos and gnomes. I wonder if it
has a troll that looks like Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   I saw a bumper sticker on the back of a truck in South Austin a
few months back that said ``George W. Bush for Lawn Ornament.'' I
wonder if this gorilla has anything to do with that? Maybe these
gorillas will end up taking the place of ice carvings at Republican
functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not familiar with it,'' Bush presidential campaign spokesman
Scott McClellan said of the concrete gorilla. ``It sounds like a
lot of political monkey business.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that Democrats always come up with funnier quotes?
Maybe it's because they drink more beer.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that George and George of the Jungle look the same
is just pure dumb luck. This is not, apparently, something that
came out of the Dirty Tricks Department at Democratic National
Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gorilla's been out probably as long as he (Bush) has,''
said David Reyckert, owner of the Double D Statuary factory in San
Patricio County, about 25 miles northwest of Corpus Christi. That
gorilla, he said, has been manufactured for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we just came out with a 15-foot, 10,000-pound
alligator,'' Reyckert said. ``I don't know how close it looks to
Gore, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it sounds more like Pat Buchanan.

 &HT;    History reweaved still fabric
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A young friend became terribly enthused about a religion-class
assignment that challenged her to come up with the top five
questions she would pose to God.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the question for me!'' exclaimed the Inquisitive
One, furiously jotting down her questions: ``God, why, are you
important?'' ``Why do we have to die?'' and the ultimate
unfathomable: ``Why is it so weird to be alive?''
</P>
<P>
   Some questions _ in this life, at any rate _ are destined to
remain unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   With DNA literally rewriting history, however, many of our
unanswered questions are being answered.
</P>
<P>
   Did Thomas Jefferson father some of Sally Hemmings' children?
Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Shawnee warrior Blue Jacket and a white man named
Marmaduke Van Swearingen one and the same? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   DNA's usefulness as a historical tool is undeniable. It puts to
rest centuries of speculation about Jefferson, and challenges
centuries of denial about the realities of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Yet are we learning more than we need to know? Could literal
truth undercut the power of legend?
</P>
<P>
   Pure legends can spring purely from our cultural hunger. Legends
based on history, however, perch on that treacherous precipice
between fact and fiction.
</P>
<P>
   We always knew that the Blue Jacket story, as presented every
summer in a Greene County amphitheater, is larger than life. But we
were prepared to believe that Blue Jacket might have been Van
Swearingen, a white man raised by the Shawnee tribe, until DNA
testing at Wright State University cast doubt on the legend.
</P>
<P>
   How much does historical accuracy matter when a legend comes to
life on stage?
</P>
<P>
   ``As for Blue Jacket not being related to the Van Swearingens,
it is not really that important to anyone but the family that
claimed him,'' said Brian Hackett, director of the Montgomery
County (Ohio) Historical Society. ``He still did what he did. The
tests did not prove he was not a white man, just not a Van
Swearingen. The story is still strong.''
</P>
<P>
   And myth? ``It is very important for the understanding of
history,'' Hackett said. ``It helps define who we are. It draws us
into a community and makes us whole. There are countless examples
where the myth is more powerful than the truth. It is part of our
makeup. Myth is the fabric of civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   With Blue Jacket, we're dealing with both historical fact and
family legend. What becomes tricky is which branch of the family is
telling the story. Who's writing the legend?
</P>
<P>
   ``The story comes through white records and not native
stories,'' noted Gaelann AllCorn, marketing manager for Cityfolk.
``I do know some of the Blue Jacket family believe the story, but
other descendants believe their ancestor was always native.''
</P>
<P>
   AllCorn, a native American, is a strong believer in
storytelling: ``I teach my daughter through things that are passed
down as stories. Our stories always contain kernels of truth or
moral lessons that are important to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   AllCorn calls the Blue Jacket production ``wonderful,'' but
thinks the story line should be altered to reflect the new facts.
``I think there are a lot of things that need to be set straight as
far as native people are concerned,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Must all of our cultural myths now pass through technology's
crucible? Will time travel ultimately prove that George Washington
never whacked that cherry tree?
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope not. As Hackett observed, ``Storytellers have always
had a revered place in our world, from the cave man campfire to
Steven Spielberg.''
</P>
<P>
   That is one truth no amount of DNA testing can ever challenge.

 &HT;    Cracking the genetic code has opened a whole new can of worms
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before he was introduced by President Clinton as one of the men
responsible for mapping the human genome, Dr. Craig Venter wrote
about the possibility of genetically engineering a man with bird
wings.
</P>
<P>
   That's the image most people have of angels.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a scientific breakthrough that can put God out of
business has to disturb some people.
</P>
<P>
   On a morning television network news show following Monday's
White House announcement that scientists completed a first draft of
the human book of life, Venter, who runs for-profit Celera
Genomics, and Dr. Francis Collins, head of the government-sponsored
Human Genome Research Institute, were asked if they believed in
God.
</P>
<P>
   Collins quickly and easily answered yes. He felt his scientific
research bolstered his religious faith.
</P>
<P>
   Venter began his answer by recounting his extensive research in
various scientific endeavors. He concluded by saying that he is
convinced that what he has seen is not man-made.
</P>
<P>
   To say that the blueprint of human life is not man-made is not
the same as professing a belief in God.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps aliens from an undiscovered dimension seeded this Petri
dish of a universe with a bit of DNA to see what would grow. At
this point, humans are the dominant life culture in this remote
section of the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   It may be considered rude to ask a scientist if he believes in
God, but the question has relevance for people who think that
humans are getting to the point where they are playing God. The
question sheds more light on the questioner than on the person
asked to reveal private beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, if scientists like Dr. Venter will be able to
splice the genetic instructions for a bird's wings into a human and
create a man who can fly, that would be unnatural meddling with
life.
</P>
<P>
   If the new genetic maps can be used to cure diseases such as
AIDS, Alzheimer's, malaria, cholera and cancer, then people will be
inclined to say the scientists are doing God's work.
</P>
<P>
   Curing diseases has theological and moral consequences. Venter
says 50 diseases are responsible for 90 percent of human death and
illness.
</P>
<P>
   If genetic advances overcame these diseases, the resulting
population explosion could spell disaster for the planet.
Disease-free people with twice the current life-span would quickly
strip the planet of its remaining natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic scientists would have to hold a few incurable diseases
in reserve so they could initiate occasional epidemics to bring the
population back into balance. War is another way to reduce surplus
population.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are working on genetically engineered food that will
better feed all the extra people saved by science from premature
death. Transgenic food already is causing a rebellion in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be right for people who refuse to eat genetically
engineered food that can save the planet from starvation to take
advantage of genetic engineering that will extend their lives.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where people can be engineered to be healthy,
intelligent and vigorous, discrimination against disabled people
will increase in insurance, employment and other aspects of life.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to reduce bad genetic predispositions will
accelerate the pressure to enhance good genetic predispositions.
China, India and several other na- tions now have distressingly
high abortion rates for female fetuses. Abortions should go up when
parents can learn that an unborn child is likely to be homosexual
or at risk for certain diseases.
</P>
<P>
   When science can create perfect babies, few pa- rents would
accept a baby less than perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps science can create a perfect theologian to solve these
riddles.

 &HT;    CLASSIC CARS, ANCIENT CITY: CHROME, FINS GIVE DAMASCUS CHARM
 &HT;    With Photos.

 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ The names come out a little differently in
Arabic. DeSoto becomes something like ``Tozata'' and Chrysler
sounds like ``Kleezler.''
</P>
<P>
   But those old bombs you might find in an auto collector's garage
in America make for colorful and practical transportation in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The country's streets are flush with fins and crawling with
chrome. Stroll the centuries-old bazaars and you're likely to be
passed not only your father's Oldsmobile, but his father's before
him.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Malik Sheikho has a 1951 DeSoto powered by a hefty 1987
Caprice motor. Pictures of the late President Hafez Assad in the
windows make it clear that this cherry-red hybrid is pure Syrian.
</P>
<P>
   Sheikho, a 37-year-old auto parts dealer, says his car is both
sensible and sensational. It's sensible because his extended family
fits inside. It's sensational for the tire-screeching fun he has
taking the corners in this ancient city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's striking,'' he says. ``I drove it to Beirut once and
everyone stared at me.''
</P>
<P>
   In Beirut, new cars are the norm. But in Damascus and other
Syrian cities, cars of yesterday are as common as the spices and
mother-of-pearl furniture in the markets.
</P>
<P>
   The affinity for retro cars is not entirely by choice. Syria's
closed economy is still mired in socialist strictures set down more
than 30 years ago. The streets of Cuba, for example, have a
similarly antiquated fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Under the socialist code, cars are a luxury and not necessary
for people meant to focus on their country's industry and defense.
In Syria, new-car buyers can be slapped with a 300(CQ) percent tax
levy and must buy registrations costing thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   While there are still some new cars on the road, many Syrians
turn to miracle-working mechanics to keep the old cars running. It
makes for an old car craze born out of necessity as well as style.
</P>
<P>
   On the style side is car collector Bashar Assad. The 34-year-old
eye doctor tapped to be the successor to his father, President
Hafez Assad, who died June 10.
</P>
<P>
   But, he's also chairman of the Classic Car Club of Syria. He
counts two vintage Cadillac El Dorados _ early '50s and early '60s
_ among his collection.
</P>
<P>
   Samir Darwish, president of the club and a friend of the Assad
family, said the younger Assad still drives himself and is very
safe, fitting for soft-spoken leader originally trained as an
ophthalmologist.
</P>
<P>
   Darwish, a wealthy Syrian businessman, owns several classics
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Among his fleet are a 1950 Fiat Ciento with ``woodie'' sidings
and a 1963 Pontiac Parisian convertible.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian roads are Darwish's primary auto show room. On the
streets, he finds old cars, usually motley combinations of
different motors and chassis, and rebuilds them with the original
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   It's the restrictions on imports that keep the old cars on the
road. Darwish said there is only about one car for every 17
Syrians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't buy a new shirt, you at least wash the shirt you
have,'' he says. ``You keep it looking good until you can get a new
one.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Hosh Blass(CQ) industrial zone on the edge of Damascus, a
stroll amid the rows of auto shops finds bug-eyed headlights,
airplane-wing hood ornaments, metal dashboards and few seatbelts.
</P>
<P>
   Here, motorists say they have old cars because they are cheap
and big, which is helpful for families with just one car. Some
owners do not even know the particular make of their car, except
that it is a Buick or Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Lotfik, owns an elegant 1951 Austin with an Opel engine
and BMW wheels. He understands a foreigner's admiration for his
wheels, but says he would rather have something new.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's history. A lot of people like it, but not here in our
country,'' he says. He would rather have a new Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more enthusiastic, even for cars that would be
considered clunkers in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's American. It's strong and powerful,'' mechanic Kiork(CQ)
Sarkisian, 60, says of his vinyl-topped, white 1976 Buick Century.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanics get the job done by reworking old parts and
subbing in newer ones. Sheikho's 1951 DeSoto, for example, has
Cadillac dome lights inside, electric windows and even a
remote-control starter.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic Samer Najjar, 28, said he's been working on cars since
his teens and has always been able to find the right parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is possible, especially in this country,'' he says.
``Thanks to God, there is always something available.''

 &HT;    CLASSIC CARS, ANCIENT CITY: CHROME, FINS GIVE DAMASCUS CHARM

   DAMASCUS, Syria _ The names come out a little differently in
Arabic. DeSoto becomes something like ``Tozata'' and Chrysler
sounds like ``Kleezler.''
</P>
<P>
   But those old bombs you might find in an auto collector's garage
in America make for colorful and practical transportation in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The country's streets are flush with fins and crawling with
chrome. Stroll the centuries-old bazaars and you're likely to be
passed not only your father's Oldsmobile, but his father's before
him.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Malik Sheikho has a 1951 DeSoto powered by a hefty 1987
Caprice motor. Pictures of the late President Hafez Assad in the
windows make it clear that this cherry-red hybrid is pure Syrian.
</P>
<P>
   Sheikho, a 37-year-old auto parts dealer, says his car is both
sensible and sensational. It's sensible because his extended family
fits inside. It's sensational for the tire-screeching fun he has
taking the corners in this ancient city.

 &UR; Copyright 2000 Discover Magazine &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Intentar encontrar algo en la red electronica Internet es como
revisar incontables cajas de carton en un atico oscuro. Inclusive
si la busqueda resulta exitosa, antes tropezaremos con gran
cantidad de basura. Y aun peor, ninguna busqueda es exhaustiva.
</P>
<P>
   El oscuro atico de la Internet es infiltrado de acuerdo al
escaso potencial de cada ``motor de busqueda''. Por ejemplo, el
directorio de Yahoo es un indice de sitios escogidos archivado por
editores anonimos. Otros catalogos populares en Estados Unidos,
tales como Excite, Lycos y Alta Vista, tienen programas que recogen
fragmentos de texto de cada pagina que encuentran y hacen una lista
de palabras clave. Esa lista parcial, no la red Internet, es lo que
rastrean los motores de busqueda.
</P>
<P>
   Esa es una de las razones de que esos catalogos informativos
tengan dificultades para mantenerse al dia con la Internet, que
cuenta actualmente con unos cinco millones de sitios, y alrededor
de 1.500 millones de paginas de informacion.
</P>
<P>
   Los expertos estiman que la cantidad de informacion en la
Internet se expande a dos millones de paginas diarias, y los
mejores motores de busqueda no cubren mas de un 16 por ciento de
esas paginas, un drastico descenso en relacion a 1997, cuando
cubrian un 34 por ciento.
</P>
<P>
   Para acortar la brecha, algunos ingenieros electronicos estan
tratando de desarrollar mejores programas. Y otros intentan
transformar el proceso de busqueda haciendolo mas humano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fast Search and Transfer (FAST)'', una nueva compania con sede
en Oslo, Noruega, ha creado un programa que puede indexar 80
millones de paginas diarias, el doble de la cantidad de otros
programas dedicados a la misma tarea. Se supone que podra catalogar
toda la Internet a comienzos del ano proximo.
</P>
<P>
   En lugar de recolectar datos en una gran lista de contrasenas,
como lo hacen otros programas, FAST divide la informacion en varios
fragmentos y los registra simultaneamente, realizando mas de 600
busquedas por segundo.
</P>
<P>
   Pero otras empresas de programacion se aproximan de manera
diferente al problema.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Krellenstein, jefe de tecnologia de ``Northern Light'' en
Cambridge, Massachusetts, cree que es mejor mana que fuerza. Su
programa no tiene el poder de FAST, pero a el no le preocupa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calculamos que hemos indexado una cuarta o una tercera parte
de la Internet, pero es la mejor parte, en terminos de calidad'',
dice.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Light clasifica las paginas de la Internet siguiendo
diferentes criterios, entre ellos una lista para clientes que
incluye 25.000 temas. Un equipo de bibliotecarios de carne y hueso
examina las clasificaciones. Cuando una persona efectua una
busqueda, el programa organiza los resultados en carpetas, cada una
con un titulo que informa del contenido.
</P>
<P>
   Tanto FAST como Northern Light todavia dependen basicamente de
busquedas al azar. Por lo tanto, el proximo paso es dar a los
programas la capacidad para reconocer relaciones entre diferentes
sitios de la Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Reka Albert, Albert-Lazlo Barabasi y Hawoong Jeong, de la
universidad de Notre Dame, en Estados Unidos, estudian como el
fenomeno llamado ``seis grados de separacion'' puede vincularse a
la Internet. En la decada del sesenta, el psicologo de la
universidad de Yale Stanley Milgram descubrio que dos perfectos
extranos podian relacionarse por una red de seis o menos conocidos.
</P>
<P>
   Los investigadores de Notre Dame tambien han demostrado que el
mundo de la Internet es del tamano de un panuelo. Tras hacer un
analisis estadistico de las conexiones ``hiperlink'' descubrieron
que el numero promedio de ``clics'' requerido para ir entre dos
paginas de la Internet seleccionados al azar, era de 19. Inclusive
si la Internet se expande a diez veces su tamano actual, el
promedio solo aumentara a 21 clics.
</P>
<P>
   El resultado de esas investigaciones es que los usuarios podran
llegar a cualquier pagina en la Internet si conocen el lugar
correcto donde empezar y como ``navegar''. La idea es crear
programas que reconozcan las caracteristicas de cada grado de
separacion.
</P>
<P>
   Y tales programas han comenzado a ser esbozados. Sridhar
Rajagopalan y sus colegas del Centro de Investigaciones Almaden, de
la IBM, en San Jose, California, han disenado un programa llamado
CLEVER, que busca sitios con una gran cantidad de hyperlinks sobre
un determinado tema.
</P>
<P>
   El programa busca rapidamente los mejores centros de
informacion. En lugar de confiar en el criterio de editores, como
lo hacen Yahoo o America Online, CLEVER recoge las opiniones de
millones de personas que han creado paginas en la Internet y anade
vinculos con sus sitios favoritos.
</P>
<P>
   Rajagopalan considera que eso es un avance para acabar con el
actual caos en la Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Otras empresas, entre tanto, intentan facilitar el proceso de
busqueda. Y eso incluye eliminar interminables, incomprensibles
listas de texto.
</P>
<P>
   WebTheme, un programa desarrollado por Jim Thomas y sus colegas
del Laboratorio Nacional del Pacifico Noroccidental en Richland,
Washington, exhibe los resultados de una busqueda como una
brillante galaxia, en que cada punto de luz representa una pagina
de la Internet y racimos de estrellas indican temas relacionados.
WebTheme tambien puede representar datos como un mapa topografico
en el cual las cumbres senalan los temas mas grandes.
</P>
<P>
   Algunos visionarios suenan con el dia en que programas
inteligentes puedan tejer conexiones entre fragmentos vinculados de
la Internet, creando un tapiz que tenga sentido por si solo. Cuando
muchas personas se concentran en un mismo topico, se registra un
proceso llamado ``filtracion'', que brinda pronosticos muy
acertados.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lucky, vicepresidente de ``Telcordia Technologies'' de
Morristown, Nueva Jersey, compara el fenomeno con el promedio de
puntaje en encuestas de futbol americano, que con frecuencia
produce certeros pronosticos de los resultados.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky confia en que un proceso similar facilitara el rastreo de
informacion en la Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gran cantidad de informacion que circula en el mundo no ha
sido registrada en los libros'', dice, ``sino que esta contenida en
los cerebros de los seres humanos. Si se pone toda esa informacion
junta, puede crearse algo mejor que cualquier opinion individual.
Despues de todo, nadie es mas inteligente que todos''.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BORRACHERAS ANIMALES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aunque la borrachera parece ser una tradicion exclusivamente
humana, el fisiologo Robert Dudley asegura que el placer de ingerir
alcohol tambien es compartido por los animales.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley, un biologo de la universidad de Texas en Austin, dice
que primates tales como chimpances, gorilas y orangutanes se
enloquecen por las frutas excesivamente maduras, base de muchos
licores de alta graduacion.
</P>
<P>
   Segun Dudley, se ha comprobado que frutas de regiones tropicales
que han pasado su grado de maduracion contienen concentraciones
alcoholicas de alrededor del cinco por ciento, superior a algunas
cervezas y vinos. Pero no son solo los primates los que gustan de
la jarana. El olor del alcohol atrae ademas a pajaros, murcielagos,
mariposas y elefantes.
</P>
<P>
   Los chimpances y los gorilas, de los cuales nuestros ancestros
humanoides se separaron hace entre cinco y siete millones de anos,
son capaces de vagabundear gran parte del dia por los bosques
buscando frutas fermentadas. El alcohol y el azucar ofrecen a los
primates valiosas calorias, en tanto la fruta aprovecha a su vez la
ayuda de los animales para dispersar sus semillas.
</P>
<P>
   De acuerdo a la teoria de Dudley, la adiccion de los animales al
alcohol persistio en los seres humanos por la misma razon que la
acumulacion de grasa. Se estima que cantidades modestas de alcohol
reducen el riesgo de afecciones cardiacas y podrian darnos algunos
anos extras de vida. Los animales predispuestos a algunos tragos de
vez en cuando serian mejores sobrevivientes, y habrian pasado sus
alterados genes a la generacion siguiente. Pero por supuesto, esa
herencia genetica ha dejado de ser util ahora que el alcohol puede
conseguirse con la misma facilidad que alimentos ricos en calorias.
</P>
<P>
   ``El alcoholismo no es otra adiccion mas'', dice Dudley. ``Es
una secuela de nuestra fisiologia alimenticia. Y una vez podamos
entender su mecanismo, tendremos una mejor posibilidad de curar sus
sintomas''.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; PRESERVANDO EL SABOR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No es lo mismo el sabor del jugo de naranja en lata, que aquel
recien exprimido de la fruta. Eso se debe a que los alimentos y
bebidas enlatados necesitan fuerte calor y preservativos, para
evitar las toxinas.
</P>
<P>
   Ahora el biologo Martin Cole, de la empresa ``Food Science'', de
Australia, ha desarrollado una forma de matar los germenes sin
arruinar el sabor.
</P>
<P>
   Cole aplica presiones de unos 10.000 kilos por centimetro
cuadrado, a fin de eliminar toxinas causadas por escherichia coli,
salmonella, y listeria, en frutas, jugos, pescados y otros
alimentos.
</P>
<P>
   La presion rompe la membrana exterior de la bacteria y destruye
proteinas cruciales para la subsistencia de los microbios.
</P>
<P>
   Debido a sus paredes rigidas, las celulas de las plantas sufren
escaso dano bajo fuerte presion. Las frutas mantienen su textura,
forma y sabor, y los jugos parecen recien exprimidos luego de la
poderosa compresion.
</P>
<P>
   Flow International, una empresa manufacturera de Kent,
Washington, se apresta a lanzar una version comercial de esa
tecnologia. La mermelada de frambuesa, conservada a alta presion, y
actualmente a la venta en Japon, demuestra sus beneficios
gastronomicos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuando se prueba la mermelada, es como si se estuviera
consumiendo frambuesa fresca'', dice Cole.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; LA BRIGADA DE LOS ROBOTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Un grupo de robots que merodea actualmente por la universidad de
Minnesota puede ir al rescate a la velocidad de una bala.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Voyles y varios de sus colegas en la universidad
disenaron dos vehiculos diminutos que pueden ser disparados desde
lanzagranadas.
</P>
<P>
   Uno de ellos, denominado Explorador, es un cilindro dotado de
ruedas y de un ``pie'' activado por un resorte que puede subir
escaleras o pasar por encima de pequenos obstaculos.
</P>
<P>
   Un segundo vehiculo en miniatura, el TerminatorBot, tiene brazos
mecanicos que se despliegan permitiendole recoger objetos. Voyles
dice que esos robots son ideales para explorar escombros sueltos a
fin de ayudar a sobrevivientes tras un terremoto.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; EL POETA DE LA PILDORA &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mientras trabajaba en Syntex, una empresa privada de ciudad de
Mexico, el quimico Carl Djerassi creo en 1951 norethindrone, una
forma sintetica de la hormona progesterona.
</P>
<P>
   Poco despues, norethindrone se convirtio en un ingrediente
activo de la pildora anticonceptiva.
</P>
<P>
   En la decada del ochenta, luego de varios anos de
investigaciones bioquimicas en la universidad de Stanford, Djerassi
decidio anadir otro elemento a su profesion y comenzo a escribir
ficcion basandose en temas cientificos. Hasta ahora ha publicado
cinco novelas, entre ellas ``Cantor's Dilemma'' y ``Menachem's
Seed''.
</P>
<P>
   La primera parte de una trilogia de obras teatrales, titulada
``An Immaculate Misconception'', fue difundida por el Servicio
Mundial de la BBC los dias 6 y 7 de mayo.
</P>
<P>
   Josie Glausiusz entrevisto a Djerassi para que hablara acerca de
su doble vida.
</P>
<P>
   PREGUNTA: ?Por que escribe ficcion?
</P>
<P>
   RESPUESTA: Trato de difundir entre el publico importantes ideas
cientificas. La gran mayoria de los legisladores no tiene la mas
minima idea acerca de ciencia o tecnologia, y sin embargo muchas
decisiones politicas estan basadas en esas cosas.
</P>
<P>
   PREGUNTA: ?Cual es la trama de ``An Immaculate Misconception''?
</P>
<P>
   RESPUESTA: Lidia con los dilemas eticos que enfrentamos a medida
que el sexo se va separando de la reproduccion. Con la
fertilizacion in vitro se puede analizar el embrion y tratar de
descubrir potenciales enfermedades, antes de insertarlo en la
mujer. Pero se trata de un procedimiento costoso y solo puede ser
financiado por millonarios en paises industriales. Estamos creando
otra brecha entre ricos y pobres.
</P>
<P>
   PREGUNTA: ?Cual sera el impacto de la separacion entre sexo y
reproduccion?
</P>
<P>
   RESPUESTA: Cambiara la relacion de poder entre hombres y
mujeres. La reproduccion sexual estaba abrumadoramente en favor del
hombre. Pero ahora, el hombre queda reducido a un simple donante de
esperma. Y la mujer puede obtener dicho esperma sin la necesidad de
relaciones sexuales.
</P>
<P>
   PREGUNTA: ?Que piensa de mifepristone (RU-486), la pildora del
aborto que esta disponible en algunos paises europeos?
</P>
<P>
   RESPUESTA: A nivel cientifico es tal vez uno de los escasos
progresos despues de la pildora anticonceptiva. Se estima que en la
actualidad, unas 50 millones de mujeres a nivel mundial se someten
anualmente a abortos. Y creo que corresponde a la mujer determinar
que tipo de aborto le conviene mas, del mismo modo en que damos a
la gente posibilidades de elegir entre diferentes metodos
anticonceptivos.
</P>
<P>
   PREGUNTA: ?Cual es su pasion mas grande?
</P>
<P>
   RESPUESTA: La curiosidad. Tal vez eso es lo que me mantiene
joven y activo, siempre deseoso de incursionar en nuevas areas. Es
por eso que quiero convertirme en dramaturgo. No hay muchas
personas que comienzan a escribir obras de teatro a los 75 anos de
edad.

 &UR; COMPITIENDO CON LOS DINOSAURIOS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hasiotis estaba recorriendo una zona cercana al lago
Powell, en Utah, en 1996, cuando descubrio estructuras blancas que
surgian de la arcilla purpura.
</P>
<P>
   A partir de esa epoca, el y su colega Robert Wellner han
descubierto unas 100 formaciones y las identificaron como tuneles
fosilizados que habrian sido excavados por mamiferos hace unos 150
millones de anos.
</P>
<P>
   En esa epoca, los mamiferos debian competir contra poderosos
dinosaurios.
</P>
<P>
   ``Si un animal se hallaba en el suelo, podia ser devorado o
aplastado. Y los arboles no debian ser muy seguros'', dice
Hasiotis, un geologo de la universidad del estado de Indiana. ``Por
lo tanto, la mejor posibilidad era excavar tuneles''.
</P>
<P>
   Esos tuneles tienen complejas formas similares a las cuevas de
mamiferos de la actualidad. Cada uno posee varias aperturas, rampas
en forma de espiral, y tres o cuatro camaras que podrian haber
servido como sala de estar, sitio de almacenaje, lugar de crianza y
bano.
</P>
<P>
   Hasiotis supone que los habitantes de esos escondites eran
similares a perros de las praderas, pero con colas mas largas y
trompas muy largas para cazar insectos.
</P>
<P>
   Hasta el momento los investigadores no han descubierto restos de
los mamiferos, pero Hasiotis proyecta hacerlo en las proximas
semanas. A fin de desenterrar huesos o dientes, proyecta usar acido
hidroclorico para disolver los depositos de carbonato de calcio que
han cubierto los tuneles.
</P>
<P>
   Hasiotis pronostica que en poco tiempo mas, podra ubicar los
restos de los timidos cavadores que eventualmente sobrevivieron a
los dinosaurios.

</P>
<P>
   Intentar encontrar algo en la red electronica Internet es como
revisar incontables cajas de carton en un atico oscuro. Inclusive
si la busqueda resulta exitosa, antes tropezaremos con gran
cantidad de basura. Y aun peor, ninguna busqueda es exhaustiva.
</P>
<P>
   El oscuro atico de la Internet es infiltrado de acuerdo al
escaso potencial de cada ``motor de busqueda''. Por ejemplo, el
directorio de Yahoo es un indice de sitios escogidos archivado por
editores anonimos. Otros catalogos populares en Estados Unidos,
tales como Excite, Lycos y Alta Vista, tienen programas que recogen
fragmentos de texto de cada pagina que encuentran y hacen una lista
de palabras clave. Esa lista parcial, no la red Internet, es lo que
rastrean los motores de busqueda.
</P>
<P>
   Esa es una de las razones de que esos catalogos informativos
tengan dificultades para mantenerse al dia con la Internet, que
cuenta actualmente con unos cinco millones de sitios, y alrededor
de 1.500 millones de paginas de informacion.
</P>
<P>
   Los expertos estiman que la cantidad de informacion en la
Internet se expande a dos millones de paginas diarias, y los
mejores motores de busqueda no cubren mas de un 16 por ciento de
esas paginas, un drastico descenso en relacion a 1997, cuando
cubrian un 34 por ciento.
</P>
<P>
   Para acortar la brecha, algunos ingenieros electronicos estan
tratando de desarrollar mejores programas. Y otros intentan
transformar el proceso de busqueda haciendolo mas humano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fast Search and Transfer (FAST)'', una nueva compania con sede
en Oslo, Noruega, ha creado un programa que puede indexar 80
millones de paginas diarias, el doble de la cantidad de otros
programas dedicados a la misma tarea. Se supone que podra catalogar
toda la Internet a comienzos del ano proximo.
</P>
<P>
   En lugar de recolectar datos en una gran lista de contrasenas,
como lo hacen otros programas, FAST divide la informacion en varios
fragmentos y los registra simultaneamente, realizando mas de 600
busquedas por segundo.
</P>
<P>
   Pero otras empresas de programacion se aproximan de manera
diferente al problema.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Krellenstein, jefe de tecnologia de ``Northern Light'' en
Cambridge, Massachusetts, cree que es mejor mana que fuerza. Su
programa no tiene el poder de FAST, pero a el no le preocupa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calculamos que hemos indexado una cuarta o una tercera parte
de la Internet, pero es la mejor parte, en terminos de calidad'',
dice.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Light clasifica las paginas de la Internet siguiendo
diferentes criterios, entre ellos una lista para clientes que
incluye 25.000 temas. Un equipo de bibliotecarios de carne y hueso
examina las clasificaciones. Cuando una persona efectua una
busqueda, el programa organiza los resultados en carpetas, cada una
con un titulo que informa del contenido.
</P>
<P>
   Tanto FAST como Northern Light todavia dependen basicamente de
busquedas al azar. Por lo tanto, el proximo paso es dar a los
programas la capacidad para reconocer relaciones entre diferentes
sitios de la Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Reka Albert, Albert-Lazlo Barabasi y Hawoong Jeong, de la
universidad de Notre Dame, en Estados Unidos, estudian como el
fenomeno llamado ``seis grados de separacion'' puede vincularse a
la Internet. En la decada del sesenta, el psicologo de la
universidad de Yale Stanley Milgram descubrio que dos perfectos
extranos podian relacionarse por una red de seis o menos conocidos.
</P>
<P>
   Los investigadores de Notre Dame tambien han demostrado que el
mundo de la Internet es del tamano de un panuelo. Tras hacer un
analisis estadistico de las conexiones ``hiperlink'' descubrieron
que el numero promedio de ``clics'' requerido para ir entre dos
paginas de la Internet seleccionados al azar, era de 19. Inclusive
si la Internet se expande a diez veces su tamano actual, el
promedio solo aumentara a 21 clics.
</P>
<P>
   El resultado de esas investigaciones es que los usuarios podran
llegar a cualquier pagina en la Internet si conocen el lugar
correcto donde empezar y como ``navegar''. La idea es crear
programas que reconozcan las caracteristicas de cada grado de
separacion.
</P>
<P>
   Y tales programas han comenzado a ser esbozados. Sridhar
Rajagopalan y sus colegas del Centro de Investigaciones Almaden, de
la IBM, en San Jose, California, han disenado un programa llamado
CLEVER, que busca sitios con una gran cantidad de hyperlinks sobre
un determinado tema.
</P>
<P>
   El programa busca rapidamente los mejores centros de
informacion. En lugar de confiar en el criterio de editores, como
lo hacen Yahoo o America Online, CLEVER recoge las opiniones de
millones de personas que han creado paginas en la Internet y anade
vinculos con sus sitios favoritos.
</P>
<P>
   Rajagopalan considera que eso es un avance para acabar con el
actual caos en la Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Otras empresas, entre tanto, intentan facilitar el proceso de
busqueda. Y eso incluye eliminar interminables, incomprensibles
listas de texto.
</P>
<P>
   WebTheme, un programa desarrollado por Jim Thomas y sus colegas
del Laboratorio Nacional del Pacifico Noroccidental en Richland,
Washington, exhibe los resultados de una busqueda como una
brillante galaxia, en que cada punto de luz representa una pagina
de la Internet y racimos de estrellas indican temas relacionados.
WebTheme tambien puede representar datos como un mapa topografico
en el cual las cumbres senalan los temas mas grandes.
</P>
<P>
   Algunos visionarios suenan con el dia en que programas
inteligentes puedan tejer conexiones entre fragmentos vinculados de
la Internet, creando un tapiz que tenga sentido por si solo. Cuando
muchas personas se concentran en un mismo topico, se registra un
proceso llamado ``filtracion'', que brinda pronosticos muy
acertados.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lucky, vicepresidente de ``Telcordia Technologies'' de
Morristown, Nueva Jersey, compara el fenomeno con el promedio de
puntaje en encuestas de futbol americano, que con frecuencia
produce certeros pronosticos de los resultados.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky confia en que un proceso similar facilitara el rastreo de
informacion en la Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gran cantidad de informacion que circula en el mundo no ha
sido registrada en los libros'', dice, ``sino que esta contenida en
los cerebros de los seres humanos. Si se pone toda esa informacion
junta, puede crearse algo mejor que cualquier opinion individual.
Despues de todo, nadie es mas inteligente que todos''.

<P>
   &UR; BORRACHERAS ANIMALES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aunque la borrachera parece ser una tradicion exclusivamente
humana, el fisiologo Robert Dudley asegura que el placer de ingerir
alcohol tambien es compartido por los animales.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley, un biologo de la universidad de Texas en Austin, dice
que primates tales como chimpances, gorilas y orangutanes se
enloquecen por las frutas excesivamente maduras, base de muchos
licores de alta graduacion.
</P>
<P>
   Segun Dudley, se ha comprobado que frutas de regiones tropicales
que han pasado su grado de maduracion contienen concentraciones
alcoholicas de alrededor del cinco por ciento, superior a algunas
cervezas y vinos. Pero no son solo los primates los que gustan de
la jarana. El olor del alcohol atrae ademas a pajaros, murcielagos,
mariposas y elefantes.
</P>
<P>
   Los chimpances y los gorilas, de los cuales nuestros ancestros
humanoides se separaron hace entre cinco y siete millones de anos,
son capaces de vagabundear gran parte del dia por los bosques
buscando frutas fermentadas. El alcohol y el azucar ofrecen a los
primates valiosas calorias, en tanto la fruta aprovecha a su vez la
ayuda de los animales para dispersar sus semillas.
</P>
<P>
   De acuerdo a la teoria de Dudley, la adiccion de los animales al
alcohol persistio en los seres humanos por la misma razon que la
acumulacion de grasa. Se estima que cantidades modestas de alcohol
reducen el riesgo de afecciones cardiacas y podrian darnos algunos
anos extras de vida. Los animales predispuestos a algunos tragos de
vez en cuando serian mejores sobrevivientes, y habrian pasado sus
alterados genes a la generacion siguiente. Pero por supuesto, esa
herencia genetica ha dejado de ser util ahora que el alcohol puede
conseguirse con la misma facilidad que alimentos ricos en calorias.
</P>
<P>
   ``El alcoholismo no es otra adiccion mas'', dice Dudley. ``Es
una secuela de nuestra fisiologia alimenticia. Y una vez podamos
entender su mecanismo, tendremos una mejor posibilidad de curar sus
sintomas''.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; PRESERVANDO EL SABOR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No es lo mismo el sabor del jugo de naranja en lata, que aquel
recien exprimido de la fruta. Eso se debe a que los alimentos y
bebidas enlatados necesitan fuerte calor y preservativos, para
evitar las toxinas.
</P>
<P>
   Ahora el biologo Martin Cole, de la empresa ``Food Science'', de
Australia, ha desarrollado una forma de matar los germenes sin
arruinar el sabor.
</P>
<P>
   Cole aplica presiones de unos 10.000 kilos por centimetro
cuadrado, a fin de eliminar toxinas causadas por escherichia coli,
salmonella, y listeria, en frutas, jugos, pescados y otros
alimentos.
</P>
<P>
   La presion rompe la membrana exterior de la bacteria y destruye
proteinas cruciales para la subsistencia de los microbios.
</P>
<P>
   Debido a sus paredes rigidas, las celulas de las plantas sufren
escaso dano bajo fuerte presion. Las frutas mantienen su textura,
forma y sabor, y los jugos parecen recien exprimidos luego de la
poderosa compresion.
</P>
<P>
   Flow International, una empresa manufacturera de Kent,
Washington, se apresta a lanzar una version comercial de esa
tecnologia. La mermelada de frambuesa, conservada a alta presion, y
actualmente a la venta en Japon, demuestra sus beneficios
gastronomicos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuando se prueba la mermelada, es como si se estuviera
consumiendo frambuesa fresca'', dice Cole.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; LA BRIGADA DE LOS ROBOTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Un grupo de robots que merodea actualmente por la universidad de
Minnesota puede ir al rescate a la velocidad de una bala.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Voyles y varios de sus colegas en la universidad
disenaron dos vehiculos diminutos que pueden ser disparados desde
lanzagranadas.
</P>
<P>
   Uno de ellos, denominado Explorador, es un cilindro dotado de
ruedas y de un ``pie'' activado por un resorte que puede subir
escaleras o pasar por encima de pequenos obstaculos.
</P>
<P>
   Un segundo vehiculo en miniatura, el TerminatorBot, tiene brazos
mecanicos que se despliegan permitiendole recoger objetos. Voyles
dice que esos robots son ideales para explorar escombros sueltos a
fin de ayudar a sobrevivientes tras un terremoto.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; EL POETA DE LA PILDORA &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mientras trabajaba en Syntex, una empresa privada de ciudad de
Mexico, el quimico Carl Djerassi creo en 1951 norethindrone, una
forma sintetica de la hormona progesterona.
</P>
<P>
   Poco despues, norethindrone se convirtio en un ingrediente
activo de la pildora anticonceptiva.
</P>
<P>
   En la decada del ochenta, luego de varios anos de
investigaciones bioquimicas en la universidad de Stanford, Djerassi
decidio anadir otro elemento a su profesion y comenzo a escribir
ficcion basandose en temas cientificos. Hasta ahora ha publicado
cinco novelas, entre ellas ``Cantor's Dilemma'' y ``Menachem's
Seed''.
</P>
<P>
   La primera parte de una trilogia de obras teatrales, titulada
``An Immaculate Misconception'', fue difundida por el Servicio
Mundial de la BBC los dias 6 y 7 de mayo.
</P>
<P>
   Josie Glausiusz entrevisto a Djerassi para que hablara acerca de
su doble vida.
</P>
<P>
   PREGUNTA: ?Por que escribe ficcion?
</P>
<P>
   RESPUESTA: Trato de difundir entre el publico importantes ideas
cientificas. La gran mayoria de los legisladores no tiene la mas
minima idea acerca de ciencia o tecnologia, y sin embargo muchas
decisiones politicas estan basadas en esas cosas.
</P>
<P>
   PREGUNTA: ?Cual es la trama de ``An Immaculate Misconception''?
</P>
<P>
   RESPUESTA: Lidia con los dilemas eticos que enfrentamos a medida
que el sexo se va separando de la reproduccion. Con la
fertilizacion in vitro se puede analizar el embrion y tratar de
descubrir potenciales enfermedades, antes de insertarlo en la
mujer. Pero se trata de un procedimiento costoso y solo puede ser
financiado por millonarios en paises industriales. Estamos creando
otra brecha entre ricos y pobres.
</P>
<P>
   PREGUNTA: ?Cual sera el impacto de la separacion entre sexo y
reproduccion?
</P>
<P>
   RESPUESTA: Cambiara la relacion de poder entre hombres y
mujeres. La reproduccion sexual estaba abrumadoramente en favor del

   ENTRAPMENT (San Francisco) _ Mark Poehlman was trolling the
Internet for someone to share his passions for cross-dressing and
foot fetishism. He answered an ad placed by ``Sharon,'' who
expressed interest but said she was really seeking a ``special
teacher'' for her three young daughters. He eventually traveled
from his Florida home to Long Beach, Calif., where Sharon showed
him some child pornography and then delivered him into the waiting
arms of state and federal agents. On Tuesday, the U.S. 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled that Poehlman had been entrapped, and
overturned his 10-year federal prison sentence for crossing state
lines to engage in sex with a minor. By BOB EGELKO.

   MIRANDA-CALIF (San Francisco) _ The U.S. Supreme Court's
unexpectedly strong affirmation of its famous Miranda rule _ that
police advise suspects of their right to remain silent before

   CALIF-INSURANCE (Sacramento, Calif.) _ California Insurance
Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush's political future has grown even
darker after a dramatic Assembly hearing that included allegations
of document shredding, back-door coercion and abuse of power.
Quackenbush has been accused of coddling insurance companies after
the 1994 Northridge earthquake. By ROBERT SALLADAY.

<P>
   TV-HISPANICS (Undated) _ Showtime's ``Resurrection Blvd.''
should be judged as it is: a solid family drama with the potential
to get even better. But because its cast and crew are almost
entirely Hispanic _ a group grossly underrepresented on television
_ the program takes on greater symbolism and meaning: This show has
to make it. It can't be just OK; it must be a trailblazer. By MARK
McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-PATRIOT (Undated) _ Mel Gibson's new movie goes
where most vanity projects fear to tread: 1776. But that's all
right; he's gone there with sci-fi action director Roland Emmerich
calling the shots. So the result _ in spite of the puffy white
shirts, mussed ponytails, 13-starred American flags and nameless
slaves _ feels more like 1996. By WESLEY MORRIS.

   RETINA-DISEASE (Albany, N.Y.) _ Macular degeneration, a disease
that affects the light-sensitive cells that line the back of the
eye, affects up to 30 million people worldwide and is the leading
cause of blindness in the United States in adults older than 60.
Although no one knows what causes it, a new treatment is providing

   PT-BOAT (San Antonio) _ After toiling six years to restore a
rare World War II combat boat, a group of Galveston, Texas,
volunteers isn't ready to surrender PT-309 so it can be displayed
outside the Nimitz Museum in Fredericksburg, Texas. The craft is
the only existing torpedo boat known to have seen combat in World
War II. By ZEKE MacCORMACK.
</P>
<P>
   SEX-GROUP (San Francisco) _ Partners in The Welcomed Consensus
describe themselves as one man and several women living together in
sexual harmony, offering classes that teach everything from
seduction methods to a one-hour orgasm. But Erwan Davon has other
names for the group and its ``training programs,'' which have been
going on for years in San Francisco and other Bay Area cities:
Pimping. Prostitution. Pandering. He claims he gave The Welcomed
Consensus more than $136,000 in cash and stock options and sued the
group in San Francisco this month, asking for his money back. By

   BERRIES (San Antonio) _ Before the world shrank, allowing fresh
fruits and vegetables from once-distant continents to fill grocery
shelves year-round, anticipation grew as the seasonal arrival of
old favorites approached. Now we take it for granted that we can
get any foods whenever we want, courtesy of overnight shipping and
greenhouses in places like Chile and Costa Rica. Yet somehow
berries have survived produce's endless summer. By JOHN GRIFFIN.

   BASEBALL-WINERY (Cooperstown, N.Y.) _ Cooperstown, one of
upstate New York's hottest tourist draws thanks to the Baseball
Hall of Fame, has a new attraction: Bear Pond Winery. Located a

Bear Pond is attempting to make the most of its connection to the

   PESO-ELECTION (San Antonio) _ For the first time since the
1970s, the Mexican presidential election may not wreak its
election-year havoc on the peso. Border banks and cross-border
trade-related businesses that would feel the pinch of a plummet
have seen few signs that Mexico's election Sunday will send the
peso into a free fall. This time around, a stronger Mexican
economy, a more stable political climate and the fact that more
business in Mexico is conducted in dollars bolster the peso. By
ASSATOU SIDIM and BONNIE PFISTER.

television show since ``Roller Derby.'' By DAVE MURPHY.

 &HT;    WRESTLING GRAPEVINE: News, gossip from the industry
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After being on the shelf for months with an arm injury, Goldberg
has given the WCW another reason to look for someone else to
feature after he re-injured his arm at ``Nitro'' Monday. He was
unable to work the next night's ``Thunder'' show, but is scheduled
to return to the ring for this week's ``Nitro.''
</P>
<P>
   Seems like the same problems that kept Goldberg's NFL career
from taking off (injuries) are keeping him from maintaining his
status as WCW's top draw.
</P>
<P>
   _ An injury in preparation for her ``Thunder'' match will also
keep Major Gunns out of the ring. She and Paisley were to face off.
The match is now on hold.
</P>
<P>
   _ It looks as though Raven could be a next ECW star to fly the
coop. Reports on the internet say Raven has had talks with WWF.
Raven, who wrestled for WCW after a lengthy run with ECW could sign
with the WWF in September.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former Raven protege Stevie Richards has returned from a foot
injury with a new gimmick for the WWF. He is expected to fight for
more censorship of the WWF's profane, sexually explicted ways.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin watch is warming up thanks to
some promotion of the WWF's July 23 pay-per-view, ``Fully Loaded.''
Promotional posters have Austin on them and the pay-per-view
Website (ppv.com). They read: ``Luck, chance ... those words have
no place in `Stone Cold' Steve Austin's vocabulary. He relies on
skill and fortitude to eliminate those who stand in his way. When
`Stone Cold' rolls the dice they're guaranteed to come up snake
eyes every time.'' While all promotional info says as usual that
the card is subject to change, it is interesting that Austin is the
focal point.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speaking of ``Fully Loaded,'' all signs point to the Rock,
Kurt Angle, Triple H and the Undertaker being involved in the main
event. It would be strange for the WWF to have another four
wrestler match as the pay-per-view main event, but it keeps a lot
of story options alive. The biggest would be a change of Triple H
from a heel to a face and Angle becoming the focal point of the
McMahon faction.
</P>
<P>
   _ Despite a tombstone piledriver by Kane on Triple H in the
``King of the Ring'' pay-per-view, the WWF is limiting the use of
such moves that could cause neck tauma.
</P>
<P>
   _ Head tauma is what Val Venis' valet Trish Stratus was feeling
after receiving a powerbomb from Chyna Monday night. The WWF cut to
a quick commerical as soon as the match between Venis and Chyna's
main man Eddy Guerrero ended. Stratus suffered a concussion from
the whiplash effect of the move and did not go to ringside with her
tag team T&AMP;A later in the show. While Stratus continued to work
with Venis and T&AMP;A, expect her to spilt from T&AMP;A before the end of
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Richard Reid Flair, father of Ric Flair, died Sunday at the
age of 81. Ric Flair, the 15-time world heavyweight champion, said,
``I hope I can be half the man my father was. He was successful in
everything he tried, and very unassuming. He was just the greatest,
most honest guy I've ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Latest Monday night rating have the WWF with a 6.4 to 2.8
advantage over WCW. Although not the widest gaps, it continues to
be no contest between pro wrestling's top two organizations.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    EDS: FILE 1 OF 2
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: In connection with high fuel prices, I keep reading about
this nation's strategic oil reserves. How much oil is there, and
where are these reserves?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is estimated to be 570
million barrels (enough to last about two months at normal
nationwide consumption levels).
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy oversees the reserve, which is stored
in underground salt caverns along the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was announced recently that 25 people won MacArthur
Foundation ``genius grants'' of $500,000. The article stated there
were no strings attached, and the money would be paid over five
years. Are the winners required to pay income taxes on these
awards, or are the taxes prepaid?
</P>
<P>
   A: The fellowships are taxable to the recipients, said Elizabeth
Kennedy at the MacArthur Fellows Program.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting: Although the term ``genius'' is commonly used in
news articles about the fellowship grants and their recipients, the
MacArthur Foundation doesn't use that word. Why? Because, as the
foundation explains, it ``connotes a singular characteristic of
intellectual prowess . . . The people we seek to support express
many other important qualities: ability to transcend traditional
boundaries, willingness to take risks, persistence in the face of
personal and conceptual obstacles, capacity to synthesize disparate
ideas and approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: A lawyer on TV stated that in order to assign the death
penalty in Texas, jurors must answer three questions. Can you tell
me what these question are, and their exact wording?
</P>
<P>
   A: Heather Browne of the Texas attorney general's office
explained that for offenses committed on or after Sept. 1, 1991,
the questions _ as stipulated in Article 37.071 of the Texas Code
of Criminal Procedure _ are these:
</P>
<P>
   (1) whether there is a probability that the defendant would
commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing
threat to society; and
</P>
<P>
   (2) in cases in which the jury charge at the guilt-innocence
phase permitted the jury to find the defendant guilty as a party
under Sections 7.01 and 7.02 of the Penal Code, whether the
defendant actually caused the death of the deceased or did not
actually cause the death of the deceased but intended to kill the
deceased or another or anticipated that a human life would be
taken.
</P>
<P>
   If both (1) and (2) are answered affirmatively, then the jury is
asked the following question: Whether, taking into consideration
all of the evidence, including the circumstances of the offense,
the defendant's character and background, and the personal moral
culpability of the defendant, there is a sufficient mitigating
circumstance or circumstances to warrant that a sentence of life
imprisonment rather than a death sentence be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   If the jury answers the questions ``yes,'' ``yes'' and ``no,''
the death penalty is imposed automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since we've just had the longest day of the year, how much
time do we lose each day until we reach Dec. 21, the shortest day?
Is it a few seconds, a minute, a couple of minutes?
</P>
<P>
   A: How much daylight is ``lost'' from June 21 to Dec. 21 _ the
summer and winter solstices _ depends a lot on where you live on
the Earth. A person at the North Pole wouldn't even see the sun set
until September. But for an example, let's use Atlanta. There, June
21 has about 14 hours and 25 minutes between sunrise and sunset. By
Dec. 21, that has dwindled to about 9 hours and 55 minutes _ a
total loss of 4 1/2 hours in six months. That's an average of
nearly 1 1/2 minutes a day.
</P>
<P>
   In actuality, the daily loss is slower near the solstices in
June and December and faster in late September, near the autumnal
equinox.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recall that relatives of John Wilkes Booth wanted to exhume
his body several years ago because they suspected it wasn't the
real Booth buried in the grave. Whatever became of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: A Maryland appeals court refused in June 1996 to let Booth's
relatives open his grave to determine if soldiers who tracked down
President Abraham Lincoln's assassin had shot the wrong man.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Booth's distant relatives wanted the body exhumed from
the grave to test a persistent theory that he escaped after the
assassination and lived for years under aliases while someone else
was buried in his grave.
</P>
<P>
   Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore refused their request, and a
lower court upheld its right to control the grave site. That ruling
was affirmed by a three-judge panel of the Court of Special
Appeals, Maryland's second-highest court.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you identify a bothersome insect that has a small, black
body and a red head? When it bites, it feels like a pinch, and it
often leaves a red welt that lasts for days. Also, is there a
recommended repellant?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be dealing with the azalea plant bug Rhinocapsis
vanduzeei, said Beverly Sparks of the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   These plant bugs are a predator of the azalea lace bug, so they
actually are beneficial to have around, because they can keep
azalea lace bug populations at low levels. However, as you perhaps
painfully noted, they can deliver a bite to humans. They have
piercing mouth parts and, if exposed to a human arm or neck, for
example, will ``test'' to see if they're a suitable food.
</P>
<P>
   Control of these insects isn't necessary, Sparks explained. What
you should do is avoid close contact with azalea plants that are
infested. Once populations of lace bugs are not available, these
bugs usually will leave in search of other prey.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I received an e-mail saying that as part of the settlement of
a lawsuit, Gerber Foods is awarding a $550 savings bond to children
born between 1985 and 1997. The messages says we're supposed to
forward the e-mail to churches, relatives and friends. Is there any
validity to this?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is the Hoax That Will Not Die. It's hard to believe it's
making the rounds once again.
</P>
<P>
   Q&AMP;A first reported on it in October 1997. As Gerber Products Co.
stated at the time _ and continues to say even now _ the so-called
settlement is ``completely inaccurate and false.''
</P>
<P>
   This misinformation appears to have started circulating after a
1996 settlement involving Enfamil and Similac infant formula and
pricing issues, but Gerber was not connected with that litigation.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Gerber says, the deadline for filing claims in that
1996 settlement expired Jan. 31, 1997. The company also says a
Minneapolis post office box listed in the e-mail for sending
documentation to Gerber for the ``claims'' has been closed by
Minneapolis postal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   More information can be found online at
www.gerber.com/contactus/faq.asp?faqcatid &QC; 6.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that Detroit is the 10th-largest city in the United
States. Can you list all the top 10?
</P>
<P>
   A: These are the top 10 most populous U.S cities, by estimate,
as of July 1, 1998, according to the Census Bureau: New York, 7.4
million; Los Angeles, 3.6 million; Chicago, 2.8 million; Houston,
1.8 million; Philadelphia, 1.4 million; San Diego, 1.22 million;
Phoenix, 1.2 million; San Antonio, 1.11 million; Dallas, 1.1
million; and Detroit, 970,000.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the last census whose statistics are available, Detroit
ranked No. 7 with 1.03 million people. These statistics are for
city limits, not metropolitan areas.

<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported on how you can obtain a replacement
Social Security card. But tell me, if someone mails in their
driver's license or work ID, how do they go around without them
until the Social Security Administration returns them?
</P>
<P>
   A: While the Social Security Administration requires proof of
identity in an application for a replacement card, the applicant
isn't required to mail the documents. An applicant can present them
in person at their nearest Social Security office, said agency
spokeswoman Patti Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are a driver's license or work ID the only acceptable
documents. Others _ which an applicant might be better able to do
without temporarily _ include passport, marriage or divorce record,
adoption record, health insurance card, military records, insurance
policy or school ID card.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the documents will be returned, Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Tiger Woods finish his college education, or did he leave
early to turn pro?
</P>
<P>
   A: The latter. In the fall of 1994, Woods, who had been playing
golf since early childhood, entered Stanford University in
California on a full scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   For some time a debate raged in the media over whether he should
drop out of college to turn pro or complete his degree first. At
16, he already had become the youngest person ever to play on the
PGA Tour, in the 1992 L.A. Open.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after winning the NCAA Division 1 championship
individual title for the first time, and after making history with
his unprecedented third U.S. Amateur title that August, Woods chose
to leave school and play golf as a professional.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can fans write to Phil Jackson, coach of the Los Angeles
Lakers, to congratulate him and his team on winning the NBA title?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mail can be addressed to him in care of Los Angeles Lakers,
Staples Center, 1111 S. Figueroa St., Los Angeles, CA 90015.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several articles about a museum dinosaur being reconstructed
say the bones were found in Argentina. Isn't it true that no human
has ever seen a dinosaur bone? Don't only fossils of bones remain?
</P>
<P>
   A: You are ``technically accurate,'' said geologist Christine
Bean at the Fernbank Museum of Natural History in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The ``bones'' found in Argentina aren't original bone.
``Although we often refer to fossil bones as such for convenience,
the actual bone has long been replaced by minerals during the
fossilization process,'' Bean explained. ``Very little of the
original bone material still remains in what we usually find.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some exceptions, although not in this case. An article
in Earth magazine reports discoveries in South Dakota's Hell Creek
formation of fossilized intact sections of bone that contain
original proteins from the bones. They were documented by the
Museum of the Rockies in Montana, Bean said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We know why actor Christopher Reeve publicly supports
research into curing spinal injuries, and Michael J. Fox does for
Parkinson's disease. But does anyone know why Jerry Lewis has been
so involved in muscular dystrophy research? When did his interest
begin?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although people have speculated that he might have known
someone, perhaps a relative, who was stricken with a neuromuscular
disease, Lewis has never disclosed a specific reason for his
interest and involvement, according to the Muscular Dystrophy
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and then-partner Dean Martin became involved with MDA in
the 1950s, said association spokesman Jim Brown, doing three
fund-raising TV campaigns around Thanksgiving. Lewis started his
solo Labor Day telethons for MDA in 1966 ``and works for us
tirelessly year-round,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Q : What sort of salary or compensation does Jerry Lewis receive
for the work he does on behalf of the Muscular Dystrophy
Association?
</P>
<P>
   A: He donates his services and receives no compensation of any
kind, MDA says.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As a computer illiterate, I'm curious: How big are the two
hard drives with secret information that were missing and then
found at Los Alamos? Are they like the tower on a computer?
</P>
<P>
   A: The hard drives, which disappeared from the weapons lab in
early May and then reappeared last week inside the lab's secure
area, are about the size of a deck of cards.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI continues to investigate the circumstances of the
disappearance and the authenticity and condition of the hard drives
that were found behind a copying machine in an area that had
previously been searched.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about the two Florida schools that finally got off
the state education department's ``F'' list included part of a
poem, ``The Man Who Thinks He Can.'' I'm not familiar with that.
Can you print the entire poem?
</P>
<P>
   A: Waler D. Wintle's ``The Man Who Thinks He Can'':
</P>
<P>
   If you think you are beaten, you are/ If you think you dare not,
you don't/ If you would like to win but you think you can't/ It's
almost a cinch you won't./
</P>
<P>
   If you think you'll lose, you're lost/ For out in the world we
find,/ Success begins with a fellow's will,/ It's all in the state
of mind./
</P>
<P>
   If you think you're outclassed, you are/ You've got to think
high to rise/ You've got to be sure of yourself/ Before you can
ever win a prize./
</P>
<P>
   Life's bsattles don't always go to the stronger or the faster
man,/ But sooner or later, the man who wins/ Is the man who thinks
he can.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to have ice cubes that are clear, not clouded.
What's the secret so I can do this with my home freezer?
</P>
<P>
   A: Connie Crawley of the University of Georgia Extension Service
suggests boiling the water and letting it cool slightly. Then pour
it into ice cube trays and let it cool some more.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a bit of experimenting at each stage to see if the
water has cooled sufficiently before being frozen to achieve the
desired clarity.

   A: The fellowships are taxable to the recipients, said Elizabeth
Kennedy at the MacArthur Fellows Program.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting: Although the term ``genius'' is commonly used in
news articles about the fellowship grants and their recipients, the
MacArthur Foundation doesn't use that word. Why? Because, as the
foundation explains, it ``connotes a singular characteristic of
intellectual prowess . . . The people we seek to support express
many other important qualities: ability to transcend traditional
boundaries, willingness to take risks, persistence in the face of
personal and conceptual obstacles, capacity to synthesize disparate
ideas and approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: A lawyer on TV stated that in order to assign the death
penalty in Texas, jurors must answer three questions. Can you tell
me what these question are, and their exact wording?
</P>
<P>
   A: Heather Browne of the Texas attorney general's office
explained that for offenses committed on or after Sept. 1, 1991,
the questions _ as stipulated in Article 37.071 of the Texas Code
of Criminal Procedure _ are these:
</P>
<P>
   (1) whether there is a probability that the defendant would
commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing
threat to society; and
</P>
<P>
   (2) in cases in which the jury charge at the guilt-innocence
phase permitted the jury to find the defendant guilty as a party
under Sections 7.01 and 7.02 of the Penal Code, whether the
defendant actually caused the death of the deceased or did not
actually cause the death of the deceased but intended to kill the
deceased or another or anticipated that a human life would be
taken.
</P>
<P>
   If both (1) and (2) are answered affirmatively, then the jury is
asked the following question: Whether, taking into consideration
all of the evidence, including the circumstances of the offense,
the defendant's character and background, and the personal moral
culpability of the defendant, there is a sufficient mitigating
circumstance or circumstances to warrant that a sentence of life
imprisonment rather than a death sentence be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   If the jury answers the questions ``yes,'' ``yes'' and ``no,''
the death penalty is imposed automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since we've just had the longest day of the year, how much
time do we lose each day until we reach Dec. 21, the shortest day?
Is it a few seconds, a minute, a couple of minutes?
</P>
<P>
   A: How much daylight is ``lost'' from June 21 to Dec. 21 _ the
summer and winter solstices _ depends a lot on where you live on
the Earth. A person at the North Pole wouldn't even see the sun set
until September. But for an example, let's use Atlanta. There, June
21 has about 14 hours and 25 minutes between sunrise and sunset. By
Dec. 21, that has dwindled to about 9 hours and 55 minutes _ a
total loss of 4 1/2 hours in six months. That's an average of
nearly 1 1/2 minutes a day.
</P>
<P>
   In actuality, the daily loss is slower near the solstices in
June and December and faster in late September, near the autumnal
equinox.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recall that relatives of John Wilkes Booth wanted to exhume
his body several years ago because they suspected it wasn't the
real Booth buried in the grave. Whatever became of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: A Maryland appeals court refused in June 1996 to let Booth's
relatives open his grave to determine if soldiers who tracked down
President Abraham Lincoln's assassin had shot the wrong man.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Booth's distant relatives wanted the body exhumed from
the grave to test a persistent theory that he escaped after the
assassination and lived for years under aliases while someone else
was buried in his grave.
</P>
<P>
   Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore refused their request, and a
lower court upheld its right to control the grave site. That ruling
was affirmed by a three-judge panel of the Court of Special
Appeals, Maryland's second-highest court.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you identify a bothersome insect that has a small, black
body and a red head? When it bites, it feels like a pinch, and it
often leaves a red welt that lasts for days. Also, is there a
recommended repellant?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be dealing with the azalea plant bug Rhinocapsis
vanduzeei, said Beverly Sparks of the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   These plant bugs are a predator of the azalea lace bug, so they
actually are beneficial to have around, because they can keep
azalea lace bug populations at low levels. However, as you perhaps
painfully noted, they can deliver a bite to humans. They have
piercing mouth parts and, if exposed to a human arm or neck, for
example, will ``test'' to see if they're a suitable food.
</P>
<P>
   Control of these insects isn't necessary, Sparks explained. What
you should do is avoid close contact with azalea plants that are
infested. Once populations of lace bugs are not available, these
bugs usually will leave in search of other prey.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I received an e-mail saying that as part of the settlement of
a lawsuit, Gerber Foods is awarding a $550 savings bond to children
born between 1985 and 1997. The messages says we're supposed to
forward the e-mail to churches, relatives and friends. Is there any
validity to this?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is the Hoax That Will Not Die. It's hard to believe it's
making the rounds once again.
</P>
<P>
   Q&AMP;A first reported on it in October 1997. As Gerber Products Co.
stated at the time _ and continues to say even now _ the so-called
settlement is ``completely inaccurate and false.''
</P>
<P>
   This misinformation appears to have started circulating after a
1996 settlement involving Enfamil and Similac infant formula and
pricing issues, but Gerber was not connected with that litigation.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Gerber says, the deadline for filing claims in that
1996 settlement expired Jan. 31, 1997. The company also says a
Minneapolis post office box listed in the e-mail for sending
documentation to Gerber for the ``claims'' has been closed by
Minneapolis postal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   More information can be found online at
www.gerber.com/contactus/faq.asp?faqcatid &QC; 6.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that Detroit is the 10th-largest city in the United
States. Can you list all the top 10?
</P>
<P>
   A: These are the top 10 most populous U.S cities, by estimate,
as of July 1, 1998, according to the Census Bureau: New York, 7.4
million; Los Angeles, 3.6 million; Chicago, 2.8 million; Houston,
1.8 million; Philadelphia, 1.4 million; San Diego, 1.22 million;
Phoenix, 1.2, 970,000.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the last census whose statistics are available, Detroit
ranked No. 7 with 1.03 million people. These statistics are for
city limits, not metropolitan areas.

 &HT;    EDS: FILE 2 OF 2
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported on how you can obtain a replacement
Social Security card. But tell me, if someone mails in their
driver's license or work ID, how do they go around without them
until the Social Security Administration returns them?
</P>
<P>
   A: While the Social Security Administration requires proof of
identity in an application for a replacement card, the applicant
isn't required to mail the documents. An applicant can present them
in person at their nearest Social Security office, said agency
spokeswoman Patti Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are a driver's license or work ID the only acceptable
documents. Others _ which an applicant might be better able to do
without temporarily _ include passport, marriage or divorce record,
adoption record, health insurance card, military records, insurance
policy or school ID card.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the documents will be returned, Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Tiger Woods finish his college education, or did he leave
early to turn pro?
</P>
<P>
   A: The latter. In the fall of 1994, Woods, who had been playing
golf since early childhood, entered Stanford University in
California on a full scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   For some time a debate raged in the media over whether he should
drop out of college to turn pro or complete his degree first. At
16, he already had become the youngest person ever to play on the
PGA Tour, in the 1992 L.A. Open.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after winning the NCAA Division 1 championship
individual title for the first time, and after making history with
his unprecedented third U.S. Amateur title that August, Woods chose
to leave school and play golf as a professional.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can fans write to Phil Jackson, coach of the Los Angeles
Lakers, to congratulate him and his team on winning the NBA title?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mail can be addressed to him in care of Los Angeles Lakers,
Staples Center, 1111 S. Figueroa St., Los Angeles, CA 90015.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several articles about a museum dinosaur being reconstructed
say the bones were found in Argentina. Isn't it true that no human
has ever seen a dinose actual bone has long been replaced by
minerals during the fossilization process,'' Bean explained. ``Very
little of the original bone material still remains in what we
usually find.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some exceptions, although not in this case. An article
in Earth magazine reports discoveries in South Dakota's Hell Creek
formation of fossilized intact sections of bone that contain
original proteins from the bones. They were documented by the
Museum of the Rockies in Montana, Bean said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We know why actor Christopher Reeve publicly supports
research into curing spinal injuries, and Michael J. Fox does for
Parkinson's disease. But does anyone know why Jerry Lewis has been
so involved in muscular dystrophy research? When did his interest
begin?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although people have speculated that he might have known
someone, perhaps a relative, who was stricken with a neuromuscular
disease, Lewis has never disclosed a specific reason for his
interest and involvement, according to the Muscular Dystrophy
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and then-partner Dean Martin became involved with MDA in
the 1950s, said association spokesman Jim Brown, doing three
fund-raising TV campaigns around Thanksgiving. Lewis started his
solo Labor Day telethons for MDA in 1966 ``and works for us
tirelessly year-round,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Q : What sort of salary or compensation does Jerry Lewis receive
for the work he does on behalf of the Muscular Dystrophy
Association?
</P>
<P>
   A: He donates his services and receives no compensation of any
kind, MDA says.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As a computer illiterate, I'm curious: How big are the two
hard drives with secret information that were missing and then
found at Los Alamos? Are they like the tower on a computer?
</P>
<P>
   A: The hard drives, which disappeared from the weapons lab in
early May and then reappeared last week inside the lab's secure
area, are about the size of a deck of cards.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI continues to investigate the circumstances of the
disappearance and the authenticity and condition of the hard drives
that were found behind a copying machine in an area that had
previously been searched.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about the two Florida schools that finally got off
the state education department's ``F'' list included part of a
poem, ``The Man Who Thinks He Can.'' I'm not familiar with that.
Can you print the entire poem?
</P>
<P>
   A: Waler D. Wintle's ``The Man Who Thinks He Can'':
</P>
<P>
   If you think you are beaten, you are/ If you think you dare not,
you don't/ If you would like to win but you think you can't/ It's
almost a cinch you won't./
</P>
<P>
   If you think you'll lose, you're lost/ For out in the world we
find,/ Success begins with a fellow's will,/ It's all in the state
of mind./
</P>
<P>
   If you think you're outclassed, you are/ You've got to think
high to rise/ You've got to be sure of yourself/ Before you can
ever win a prize./
</P>
<P>
   Life's bsattles don't always go to the stronger or the faster
man,/ But sooner or later, the man who wins/ Is the man who thinks
he can.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to have ice cubes that are clear, not clouded.
What's the secret so I can do this with my home freezer?
</P>
<P>
   A: Connie Crawley of the University of Georgia Extension Service
suggests boiling the water and letting it cool slightly. Then pour
it into ice cube trays and let it cool some more.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a bit of experimenting at each stage to see if the
water has cooled sufficiently before being frozen to achieve the
desired clarity.

mangoes has its own twist on using them in dishes. (Norris, Palm

EUROPEAN TRAVEL AGENTS FEAR AIRLINE WEB SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Taking a cue from the travel industry in the United
States, European airlines and hotel companies have begun setting up
their own Web sites, where customers can shop for flights and
rooms. And as in the United States, the action is angering travel
agents who fear the sites will cut them off from some of the more
tempting offerings.
</P>
<P>
   In May, 11 European airlines _ led by British Airways, Lufthansa
and Air France _ announced plans for a Web site where consumers can
shop for fares and order tickets. The site has yet to be named, but
it will be managed by the McKinsey Consulting Group. The airlines _
which also include Alitalia, Austrian Airlines, British Midland,
Finnair, Iberia of Spain, KLM of the Netherlands, Aer Lingus and
Scandinavian Airlines Systems (SAS) _ hope to have it operational
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, three of Europe's largest hotel groups, Hilton
International and the Forte Hotel Group of Britain, and Accor of
France, agreed to set up a similar Web site for hotel
accommodations. The hotel site is also expected to be up by year's
end.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, a similar booking system called T2 was
announced in January by Continental, Delta, Northwest and United
Airlines, to allow consumers to shop for inexpensive air fares on
participating airlines, and one day perhaps, on all others as well.
The site, which has since been joined by at least 23 other
airlines, is due to start up later this year.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, as in North America, the goals of the airlines and
hotels are twofold: first, to wean some customers from travel
agents, who charge the airlines commissions. But more important,
airline and hotel executives concede, they are trying to seize back
the initiative from the array of Internet companies that offer
inexpensive flights and hotel accommodations on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the clicks versus the bricks, unless we did
something,'' said David Michels, chief executive of Hilton
International. ``We have a right to sell our own product direct to
the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Eddington, chief executive of British Airways, said, ``All
our research shows that customers want to be able to compare and
buy offers from a wide range of airlines by visiting just one
site.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilton executives say the plan is not aimed against travel
agents and that they will continue to use agents. Instead, they
say, it is aimed at middlemen, often working through Web sites, who
buy up low-fare plane tickets or vacant hotel rooms and pass them
on to the customer, usually pocketing a thin margin. And indeed,
travel agents themselves will be able to use the hotel site, Hilton
says.
</P>
<P>
   As in the United States, the plans by the airlines and hotels
are also a reaction to a wave of startup online travel agencies.
The Boston Consulting Group, which is managing the airlines' Web
site in the United States, estimates that total online travel
transactions in Europe was about $930 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   That is less than 1 percent of the $116.3 billion Europeans
spent on travel, but growth at British-based companies like
ebookers.com and lastminute.com, as well as dozens of other sites
in Europe, has been dramatic. From 1998 to 1999, European online
travel booking, though admittedly starting at very low levels, grew
280 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the travel agents, who are far better organized than the
online companies, have reacted strongly. In the United States, the
American Society of Travel Agents has asked the Justice Department
to decide whether the plans by the American and European airlines
violate antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations of travel agents in several European countries,
including Britain, Spain and Germany, want to take similar action
in Europe. In May, the two largest Spanish organizations
representing travel agencies wrote to the chairman of the Spanish
carrier Iberia, which supports the European airline plan,
threatening to appeal to antitrust regulators, and accusing the
airlines of ``not trying to improve sales or customer service, but
to begin operating themselves as travel agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Betton, director of corporate affairs at the Association
of British Travel Agents, said travel agent organizations
throughout the 15-nation European Union were considering an appeal
to antitrust regulators. ``Obviously, airlines and others are
perfectly free to set up Web sites, but they mustn't be
anticompetitive,'' he said. ``We would be very upset if there were
offers online which were not available to travel agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it appears unlikely that the pressure on the traditional
travel agents will diminish any time soon. Some European airlines,
including Lufthansa and Finnair, already enable customers using
cell phones with limited access to the Internet to check for flight
delays or to change reservations. Within two to three years, they
expect customers to be able to use their phones to book flights and
buy tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Moran, chief executive of the Irish Travel Agents
Association, recently described the use of the Web for reservations
as just another form of distribution to which travel agents would
have to adapt. To remain competitive, he said, travel agents would
have to stress other kinds of services, like providing advice and
information.

SILLY WEB SITE CAUGHT IN SERIOUS FREE-SPEECH FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers 
can make individual purchases by calling 888-346-9867 or
888-603-1036.) 
 By RICHARD HIGGINS   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Silly, you say, a free Web site that can turn the lyrics of the
Marine Corps Hymn into a dialect called Swedish Chef: ``Frum zee
hells ooff Muntezooma tu zee shures ooff Treepuli.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, to render it in Elmer Fuddese: ``. . . to the shaws of
Twipowi.''
</P>
<P>
   And being silly was all a New Hampshire man was aiming for when
he created the Dialectizer page two years ago. It will turn any
text, including Web pages, into one of seven pseudo dialects.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Samuel Stoddard has become enmeshed in an Internet
free-speech battle. Last month, he shut down the Dialectizer page
after corporate lawyers raised the threat of a copyright lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after an outpouring of support from around the country and
offers of donations for legal fees, Stoddard, who lives in
Somersworth, N.H., has reopened an altered version of Dialectizer
on his entertainment Web site, Rinkworks.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started doing this because I thought it was pretty
amusing,'' said Stoddard, 26, a software engineer for a computer
networking company in Durham, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never intended to tackle the First Amendment. I'm glad I'm
in this, though, because it's interesting. It just wasn't the fight
I counted on having.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoddard started Dialectizer two years ago as a parody of
legitimate Web translation sites. It is one page on Rinkworks.com,
which includes film reviews, science fiction features, and lots of
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can type in text or an entire Web page to be translated
into seven fake dialects: Redneck, Cockney, Elmer Fudd, Swedish
Chef, Pig Latin, Moron, and Jive.
</P>
<P>
   The page became more popular than Stoddard imagined, with 7,000
to 8,000 hits a day and as many as 10,000 hits on peak use days.
The traffic jammed his servers. Overall, Rinkworks.com has about
100,000 visitors a day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dialectizer relies on basic programming, performing ``search and
replace'' functions according to translation rules that Stoddard
developed and occasionally refines for an extra ounce of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dialects are works in progress,'' said Stoddard, whose
``office'' is no more than a Pentium Pro desktop computer in the
family room of his house in Somersworth, just north of Portsmouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote Redneck and Moron from scratch, but the others I
picked up and modified from the Web,'' who gets part-time help from
a friend, Dave Parker. ``They were thrown out there as freeware.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble began when people started translating entire Web pages
into the dialects. Some Web site developers and companies were not
only not amused, but they began protesting.
</P>
<P>
   Stoddard agreed to block the translation of any Web sites that
complained. By April, he had done so for 10 sites.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in early May, he got a letter from a lawyer for the Bank
of America. Not only did the lawyer, Larry Jones, want the
translation of the bank's Web site blocked, but he raised the
possibility that Stoddard was committing copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their threat was the last straw for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stoddard said he is confident that he was not breaking
any law, proving himself right could be expensive, and on May 10 he
shut down Dialectizer.
</P>
<P>
   That proved equally unpopular _ but to a different crowd.
Outraged techies and other supporters of Dialectizer, alerted by a
piece on Slashdot, a Web site created by anticopyright computer
programmers, responded by attacking the ``corporate bullies'' who
saw copyright problems.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of this e-rage, he was getting one e-mail a
minute. Several of those e-mails are in the Slashdot archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that corporations are using the threat of a lawsuit
to force individuals to conform to their dictates just frosts my
butt,'' wrote ``Geekbird'' on May 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time for a round of Lawyer Skeet Shooting,'' said another
message.
</P>
<P>
   Others described how much fun they had had translating documents
like Microsoft copyright announcements into Redneck.
</P>
<P>
   Yet others attacked Stoddard for closing down the site, with one
person saying someone should ``shoot the loser wimp who runs the
Dialectizer for caving in to folks at Bank of America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was overwhelmed by the response,'' said Stoddard.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stoddard said he had been gradually losing interest in
Dialectizer, the response ``fired me up.'' On June 5, he brought
the page back up _ this time with an expanded legal defense of
Dialectizer and a prominent notice that any Web site can be
blocked. The revised site also includes a link allowing
organizations to block their own site.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the Bank of America attorney, said through a spokeswoman
that he was satisfied with the fact that the company was able to
block its site from being parodied.
</P>
<P>
   But the threatened suit might have been hard for the bank to
win. Jon Grossman, a lawyer in Washington who specializes in
copyright law, said the Dialectizer probably would fall under
protection from copyright law offered to parody.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems clear to me that what we are offering is protected by
law,'' said Stoddard, noting that courts have not found
``derivative parodies of works'' to be copyright violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of the people who are objecting are taking
themselves and their work a little too seriously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since reopening the site with instructions about blocking,
things have become more civil, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he received a request for a site to be blocked, and
``it was refreshing to see it worded in a civil, professional
manner. The requests for site blocks I got before had a much
angrier tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that only gives Stoddard more time to fend off
another controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of Dialectizer, he said he has received e-mail
from people who find the translations into Jive to be racist and
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Stoddard disagrees and has put a lengthy disclaimer on the Web
page stating that acknowledging ``cultural differences'' does not
mean discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way we will ever conquer racism,'' it states, ``is
not by suppressing those differences but by cherishing them,
bringing them out into the open in such a comfortable and
nonthreatening way that we become at ease enough with them . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Angry e-mails and letters from lawyers aside, the support he has
received _ and the higher profile his Web site has gained _ have
encouraged Stoddard, who nurtures hopes of being a filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The increased popularity has also brought offers to buy
Rinkworks.com, but Stoddard is not interested in selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life's passion is here,'' he said. ``I've really tried
to harness everything I care about. So I'm not going to sell. It's
a lot of work, but I'd rather keep doing it as a passionate
hobby.''

<P>
   The lads at British Telecom finally cleaned out their closets
the other day. And there, amid old biscuit tins and burnt-out
vacuum tubes, they stumbled across a chunk of solid gold. Or fool's
gold. Time will tell.
</P>
<P>
   If you're reading this on the World Wide Web, you probably got
here by clicking a hyperlink, a spot on the Web page that lets you
hop to some other spot on the Internet just by clicking a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Hyperlinks are vital to the working of the Web. We could make do
without them; there are lots of other ways to find stuff on the
Internet. But it was the application of hyperlinks that made
Internet use simple enough for 5-year-olds and journalists. It was
the hyperlink that transformed the Internet from a geeky curiosity
to a prime mover of the world's economy.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what? British Telecom owns the hyperlink, or thinks it
does. During a recent search through its 15,000 or so patents,
company lawyers came across US Patent Number 4,873,662, applied for
in 1980, granted in 1989. It's a patent for an ``information
handling system and terminal apparatus therefor,'' and I've got to
admit that the system sounds quite a bit like hyperlinking.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody at BT noticed the same thing. Now the company has begun
contacting American Internet providers, to discuss the size of the
royalty checks. Ironically, only American companies are targeted,
because similar BT patents in other lands have all expired. The US
patent was issued much later than the others, and will remain in
effect until 2009.
</P>
<P>
   The news has a lot of Web site owners planning a reenactment of
the Boston Tea Party, and vowing never to pay the British company a
dime. But BT's royalty raid will likely have no effect on Internet
commoners. BT has no intention of seeking cash from people with
hyperlinks inside their Web pages. ``That would be nonsensical,''
said BT spokesman Simon Craven.
</P>
<P>
   Not very lucrative either. But America Online, Earthlink,
Microsoft Network _ those are companies with real money. BT may
also try to collect fees from makers of the software people use to
design their hyperlinked Web pages. ``What we're looking for,''
says Craven, ``is a reasonable royalty based on revenues that
others enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   They might be looking for quite some time, if American firms dig
in and fight. ``I think British Telecom has some serious explaining
to do,'' said Colorado patent attorney Carl Oppedahl.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, why did the company wait so long before asserting
its patent rights? Craven says that it really wasn't worth
bothering about until 1996 or so, when the Internet began to put on
weight. But that's still four years ago. ``Laches'' is a Latin word
meaning ``use it or lose it.'' It's also a principle of patent law,
says Oppedahl. Hold off too long on enforcing your patent, and it
dies.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another bit of legal jargon: ``prior art.'' This refers
to whether a technology really is original. A live patent dies fast
and hard if it turns out that others had previously come up with
the idea, and put it to use. It took only a few minutes' scouring
of the Internet to find evidence that BT was late to the concept of
hyperlinking.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Engelbart always was quick on the uptake. He's credited
as the inventor of the computer mouse. In the 1960s he was also
tinkering with a data management system he called NLS.
</P>
<P>
   If you drop in at Engelbart's Web site at www.bootstrap.org,
you'll see that NLS seems to embody the basic ideas found in the BT
patent. Sure looks like prior art to me. Then there's Engelbart's
pal Andries van Dam, a professor at Brown University. He and
Engelbart were shopping hyperlinked databases to companies like IBM
in the late 1960s, according to a document on display at the Brown
University Web site. Van Dam went on to a similar system of his own
called FRESS that was humming away at Brown during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. van Dam is traveling and hasn't reviewed the BT patent, but
he declares: ``I would be amazed if they had come up with something
sufficiently unique to support a patent claim.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing will likely be settled by the true masters of
the Internet _ lawyers and judges.
</P>
<P>
   Or the Internet service providers may just shrug and pay up.
What do they care? They'll pay serious cash before this case is
closed.
</P>
<P>
   The only question is whether it'll go to their legal teams, or
our cousins across the pond.

DRAG AND ... IT'S JUST A DRAG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY   
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I am in dire need of your perspicacity. My
current system is disgusting (a Pentium II with Windows 98 Second
Edition). The clock will lose a full day in about two weeks. Also,
when you click the mouse pointer on something, there is a delay,
and when I type, there is a delay before the letters show up. I
call the hardware manufacturer, and he blames the software or the
operating system. I call the software company, and they blame the
hardware or the OS. I have never been able to talk to a real person
at Microsoft, so I am unsure who they'd blame.
</P>
<P>
   _ Slow Motion
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SLOW: There are no real people at Microsoft. I mean, have
you ever actually seen anyone who works there, other than Big Bill
or Steve Ballmer? Or maybe the're all just hiding in their
windowless little offices, eating aerosol cheese and sardines,
hoping nobody asks them why their products are so full of bugs.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I really hate about trying to run down a problem with
no clear solution is trying to get a straight answer out of a
support technician. I wish they'd just say they don't have a clue
instead of pointing a finger at somebody else. And before you say
it, yes, I've done the same thing when I've wanted to get rid of a
particularly annoying user and get back to playing Unreal
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, since I know I'll get the run-around from three or four
different help desks, I generally start looking for the answer
myself somewhere out there on the Internet. Try the Knowledge Base
at Microsoft (support.microsoft.com) first, although ``knowledge''
is a bit of a stretch. Maybe ``Stuff We Figured Out For Whiny
Users'' didn't sound so hot to the Marketing Department.
</P>
<P>
   Most software and hardware companies have similar collections of
fixes and suggestions on their Web sites. Just look for ``support''
links.
</P>
<P>
   The best places to find an answer, however, are news groups,
where you post a message and hopefully get an answer. When the
Internet was more text-based, these groups were fabulous places for
finding people with similar interests and problems, software,
little-known tips and, of course, dirty pictures. New Internet
users often pass the groups by, probably because the dirty pictures
are easier to see using a browser.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising the groups, I learned that you're not the only one out
there losing time and putting up with a jerky mouse and keyboard.
Most PC clocks are about as accurate as my SATs, plus a flaky
battery will exacerbate the problem. But there's something else
afoot here, a conspiracy of major proportions. OK, maybe not a
conspiracy and maybe not major, but let me point a few fingers
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Many people report the slowdowns happen after installing Win98
Second Edition or Microsoft's Y2K patches. Others complain that it
all started after installing Norton AntiVirus 5.0 with
Auto-Protect, which runs all the time. And even Microsoft says that
your system can slow down when running stuff like a virus checker
in the background. No definitive answer, but there are a few clues.
</P>
<P>
   Some programs just don't play well with Win98, so turn off your
virus checker and see if things speed up. No? Try this: Shut down
everything else that's going on behind the scenes. If you hit
Control-Alt-Delete, you'll get a dialogue box that lets you end
individual tasks. You can safely knock out everything but Explorer
and Systray. If that doesn't work, go back to the Microsoft support
site and look for document Q259161 for some other suggestions.

XML USHERS IN NEW WAVE OF WEB PAGE DESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID SIMS   The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A potential successor to HTML, the computer language that tells
your browser how to display Web pages, could be a boon to small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   It's called XML _ the Extensible Markup Language _ and it's a
bit like the story of the blind man and the elephant: depending on
where he approached it, he thought it was a snake, a rope, or a
wall.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing that XML does do is allow you to create new markup
languages unique to a certain task.
</P>
<P>
   A markup language is a system of tags that lets you tell a
computer what certain content is or means. If you've ever looked at
the underlying code of a Web page (you can do this by pulling down
the View menu on your browser, and choosing Source), you'll see the
HTML (hypertext markup language) that makes the page show up in
your browser. Headlines are marked with an H1, italics are marked
with an ``i,'' and so on.
</P>
<P>
   HTML has a limited number of tags. But the ``extensible''
aspects of XML offer a way to create new tags for different uses.
So, for example, someone doing business in the wine industry could
create a markup language that included tags for things such as
vintage year, type of grape, winery, appellation, price, and so on.
They could call it the VML, the vintners' markup language, and it
would be just one of many XML languages.
</P>
<P>
   Why would they bother to do this? One advantage is that if
everyone in an industry can get together and agree that they will
use that markup language, then their Web servers can easily
exchange information about the goods they're buying and selling.
So, for example, I could do a search for all zinfandels from the
Alexander Valley, and ask my computer to list only those with
bottle prices between $10 and $30.
</P>
<P>
   That would be interesting, but more interesting would be if my
computer and the winery's computer could complete the transaction
on their own. So that if I were a reseller looking for a certain
price on a type of wine, I could set my machine to look for that,
and buy it when it found it. The winery's machine and mine could
complete the sale, I would get a confirmation from the winery's XML
server, and the wine would arrive at my store in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 30 years, some companies have been working on
systems like this to make computers do much of this work by talking
to each other. Collectively, they have been called EDI, or
electronic data interchange.
</P>
<P>
   But these systems have been expensive to implement and have been
limited to companies that can afford them.
</P>
<P>
   One of XML's promises is to bring EDI-like services to
companies, especially those in developing countries, that have been
unable to afford EDI _ which can cost millions of dollars to
implement.
</P>
<P>
   XML makes it possible to do this relatively cheaply, so that a
desktop machine running at a small shop in Thailand can communicate
over the Web with computers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Mac made everyone a desktop publisher, and as the
Web made everyone a global publisher, so might XML make every
business able to communicate electronically with every other
business _ all for pennies per transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Several groups are contending to be the main repository for
these XML classifications, called schemas. Microsoft is sponsoring
one called BizTalk. Another group, called Oasis, is working with
the United Nations on a strategy called ebXML, which hopes to make
one global repository of this type of business information.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is still mostly wealthy companies that are working
to build this repository, a trickle-down effect may follow. Once
standards are defined, and vendors build tools to work with them,
these tools may become as inexpensive as Web development tools _ a
few hundred dollars or less. If that happens, it could be just one
more way that the Web levels the playing field.

   GROUPS FEAR INTERNET BECOMING ``VIRTUAL GUN SHOW''
</P>
<P>
   By EUNICE MOSCOSO
</P>
<P>
   C.2000 COX NEWS SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Internet is quickly becoming a gun-owner's
dream market. Hundreds of sites offer everything from custom
holsters to Colt revolvers _ many at discount prices.
</P>
<P>
   No driving to a store. No trade show fee. Unbelievable
selection.
</P>
<P>
   While gun collectors and dealers hail this new branch of
E-commerce, it's making gun control groups increasingly nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the Internet is becoming a virtual gun show,'' said
Kristen Rand, director of federal policy for the Violence Policy
Center, a group that supports gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Rand said the Web is creating a national market that facilitates
interstate gun sales. This defies ``the bedrock of gun regulation
in America'' which is to keep sales within each state in an effort
to control distribution and access, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, gun control advocates say regulations on Internet
sales are not carefully monitored and that many sites, which merely
hook up buyers and sellers, have no obligation to abide by the
rules that regulate gun dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can set up an Internet site that sells guns,'' Rand
said. ``They can sell a million guns over a site and the owner of
the site would be under no duty to get a federal firearms
license.''
</P>
<P>
   Some big online auction houses, including eBay, have decided to
refuse gun trade, but there are still an estimated 80 auction sites
devoted to firearms and about 4,000 sites that have gun sales.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon has added another dimension to what are called
``secondary markets'' for guns, which previously included gun shows
and private sales, often through classified ads. These secondary
markets _ which account for an estimated 40 percent of sales _ have
long been the target of gun control proponents.
</P>
<P>
   But comparing online sales to gun shows and private sales isn't
fair, says Dale Blankenship, who owns and operates dalesguns.com _
an Internet site that he started about two years ago, to supplement
his home-based business in Powhatan, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how they come up with that,'' he said. ``I
think Internet is the safest.''
</P>
<P>
   Blankenship, who has worked in gun repair and sales for 17
years, said that the problem at gun shows has to do with unlicensed
dealers. On the Internet, regulations call for any firearm
transaction to take place through a dealer with a federal license,
which requires a background check.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people get real confused... they think I can just
sell to anybody,'' he said. ``I can't deliver (a firearm) to
anybody except another dealer.''
</P>
<P>
   If a private individual wants to buy a gun on the Internet, they
must do it through a dealer, who charges the buyer a small fee.
Sellers require the buyer to send a photocopy of the federal
license bearing a fresh signature.
</P>
<P>
   But sellers are not required to call the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms to verify that a name or address on a license
is valid, although the regulation says dealers may investigate
further if they wish.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control proponents say these regulations are loosely
enforced and easy to circumvent.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, two high school students in Montclaire, N.J.,
figured it out.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the 17-year-olds passed themselves off as dealers,
after persuading a Florida gun dealer to give them his license
number on an online chat room.
</P>
<P>
   They used the number to forge a license and used it to purchase
at least four handguns through an Atlanta, Ga.-based site,
GunBroker.com. Federal licenses are about the size of a car title
and don't carry a photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Blankenship said he didn't know if he could spot a fake license
but added, ``I think I would be able to tell. I hope I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates say another flaw in the Internet gun trade
is that the dealer can't see the customer face to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a customer comes in person, a dealer might be able to
look at someone and ask: Does this person look underage? Does this
person look like he is clearly intoxicated or mentally deranged?
Over the Internet, you can't tell. You can't see at all,'' said
David Bernstein, spokesperson for Handgun Control, Inc., a
Washington-based lobby group.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Blankenship said that when someone walks into his
business to buy a gun, he can't deny them a sale because of their
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I legally can't say: 'Hey you don't look right,''' he said,
adding that he won't sell anyone a gun until they pass a background
check required by law.
</P>
<P>
   The growing trend of Internet gun sales has caught the attention
of state and federal law enforcement agencies. The push for
regulations will likely increase as more buyers turn to the Web.
Some sites are already making millions in sales. The Atlanta-based
GunBroker.com is projecting $12 million in sales by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the booming E-commerce, the ATF is considering
starting a unit to investigate firearms and explosives sales on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, Attorney General Jim Ryan has launched a new
initiative to target illegal gun sales online and at gun shows.
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., is backing a request from
Ryan for an $ 850,000 federal grant to create a special unit to
investigate and prosecute such cases.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S. Senate, an amendment that would have prohibited
unlicensed dealers from selling guns over the Internet was defeated
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who introduced the measure, said
he is revising pending gun control legislation to require online
verification of licensees. But such a provision has little hope of
passage this year as several gun control measures have been stuck
in Congress for months.
</P>
<P>
   Rand said that delays in further regulation of Internet gun
sales could have tragic results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of time before something truly horrible
happens where someone got their weaponry over the Internet...It's
entirely predictable.''

 &HT;    INTERNET WINDS ITS WAY INTO SYRIAN CONSCIENCE
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW  c.2000 Cox News Service  DAMASCUS, Syria _
<TEXT>
Barely big enough for nine computers, Zoni Internet Service offers
Syrians an on-line window to the outside world.
<P>
   A marker board lists cloaking sites, like ``besilent.com''.
Customers use them to get around firewalls to ``hotmail.com'' and
other mail systems blocked by the Syrian government's server.
</P>
<P>
   But, even more significant than the fact that Zoni gets away
with this, is that many other sites do not appear to be impeded by
the government at all.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can go to the Amnesty International homepage to read
up on torture in Syrian jails. They can get most newspapers and
news magazines on-line anywhere. They cannot get sites from Israel
but they can call up the Israeli Embassy Website in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Zoni is one of at least three non-government Internet shops
opening in the last nine months in Damascus. Tucked away on the
fourth floor of a dingy office building, it has the feel of
something slightly illicit but is brimming with optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in Syria, many things will change,'' says 32-year-old
owner Yamor Alzoni, a bearded, practicing Muslim on the crest of
his country's Internet wave.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Syrian government is for it or not _ and the signals
are mixed _ Internet use is slowly expanding in a country known for
slow change and controlled speech.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Syrian officials are showing a hesitancy typical of
authoritarian regimes confronted with a new technology. They don't
want to be left behind by the on-line world, but they seem intent
on trying to chaperone and manage their people's activity there.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians must have government licenses to get a password for
using the Internet. Officials say there are only about 7,000
Internet-licensed hook-up ``points,'' including those in schools or
other places with multiple users, for this country of more than 17
million.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the country's phone system has not been able to handle
more Internet users, officials limit the licenses to institutions
and the elite, like professors or business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Zoni's clients are largely foreigners checking E-mail messages.
The US$6.50-per-hour fees deter most Syrians. The country's per
capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1998, the last year
available, was estimated at just US$2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Further slowing Internet use, there's a gray area for Syrians
hoping to get on-line from home.
</P>
<P>
   Saadalla Aghad Kalaa(cq all), head of the media committee for
the government-backed Syrian Computer Society, said the country is
not ready yet to plunge into unfettered home Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the Internet at home is something that could hurt this
traditional society,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Syrians can use the Internet at home, he hesitates and
says in his precise English, ``It is not forbidden, but it is not
allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria has begun loosening some controls on information.
Television satellite dishes were in effect legalized, albeit
slowly, in the mid-1990s. They sprout up by the thousands on
apartment-block rooftops in the city that claims to be the oldest
continually lived -in capital on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The computer society is headed by Bashar Assad, son of, and
likely successor to, the late Syrian President Hafez Assad. His
patronage has raised hopes that he will welcome the new computer
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Kalaa said the society and government have 200 computer training
centers around the country and expect to license more than 200,000
Internet hook-ups next year.
</P>
<P>
   But Syria is famous for restrictive, socialist-style planning.
</P>
<P>
   While other countries thrive off the freedom and spontaneity of
Internet use, Syria dribbles out the licenses. It tries to herd
users _ may of whom have computers at home _ into post offices,
schools or other centers where the Internet is available.
</P>
<P>
   Kalaa hosts a weekly television show that demonstrates the uses
of computers and the Internet. But, he says callers to the show
have a regular complaint: ``Why are you showing us this if we can't
use it at home?''
</P>
<P>
   Kalaa says it is a balancing act, trying to introduce the new
technology without angering older-generation Syrians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell them, 'Even if you cannot use it, you must not stop
it,''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Alzoni, the Internet shop owner, said government officials have
now denied him permission for a second branch. He believes it is
more out of the government's desire to control Internet monopolies
than any desire to restrict information.
</P>
<P>
   He notes that he's also been told that he cannot run an Internet
``cafe.'' Government departments keep a close eye on cafes and
coffee shops, places where people can gather and conspire. That
seemed to bother officials more than the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   So, Alzoni said, he called his business an Internet ``service''
and kept it open.

<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Embracing an approach to computing it once
scoffed at, Microsoft unveiled a strategy Thursday that will
increasingly move its business away from the personal computer the
company has championed since the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would retool its product line to shift the
very focus of computing away from hardware devices and toward a new
generation of Internet-based software allowing people to interact
with data and one another whether they are using computers, digital
cell phones or interactive televisions.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, portrayed the long-awaited
initiative as ``more ambitious than anything we've done,'' adding,
``There is no Microsoft product that isn't touched by this
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The fanfare surrounding the announcement and demonstrations here
Thursday signaled that Microsoft considered the move as momentous
as its decision in December 1995 to ``embrace and extend'' the
Internet after being caught flatfooted by the rise of the World
Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's subsequent integration of a Web browser directly
into its Windows operating systems led to the antitrust case in
which a federal judge has ordered the company split in two and
imposed severe restrictions on its business practices.
</P>
<P>
   But those restrictions have now been suspended while appeals
proceed, probably for a year or more, lifting what Microsoft said
would be a serious impediment to the strategy it announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gates showed no signs Thursday of being intimidated by the
antitrust case, saying the browser, which he called a ``universal
canvas,'' would become the principal user interface for all
interaction with a variety of new services.
</P>
<P>
   In demonstrations and videos, Gates and his top executives
introduced what they portrayed as a vision of a new software
platform _ called .NET _ in which users will be surrounded by a
range of devices providing access to a universe of information,
including business and personal data.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not quite like the past where there was a single device
that defines all of this,'' Gates said. ``There will be many
different devices.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy will involve repackaging some of the company's core
products, like its Office software, as subscription-based services
obtained over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said the new products would be introduced in increments
beginning next year, when Microsoft plans to introduce a version of
its Windows operating system to be called Windows.Net 1.0.
</P>
<P>
   He also demonstrated a natural language interface that would
permit people to interact with a machine via voice, handwriting or
commands entered in natural human language.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Maritz, a Microsoft group vice president, said the overall
initiative would be ``a long march'' that could take a decade or
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft emphasized that the centerpiece of its new approach
would be an increasingly popular Internet standard, XML, that
facilitates the automatic interchange of information.
</P>
<P>
   In each example the company tried to show how the data-sharing
facility of XML would allow people who work and play together to
share information like scheduling, homework, music and videos to
collaborate seamlessly whether they were connected by PCs, cell
phones or tablet computers _ notebook-sized devices that can be
activated by pen, voice or keyboard, or read as books.
</P>
<P>
   One example of the power promised by the .NET world was a video
scenario in which a family posed for a digital portrait while on a
trip to the zoo. A child then transmitted the photo via his cell
phone to his grandparents, who were watching television. Without
leaving their couch they were able to view the image on the
television set, and then, with a simple command using the remote
control, they transferred the image to a nearby digital picture
frame.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy is striking because Microsoft's executives once
strongly resisted the notion that the personal computer might be
supplanted by competing products, from handheld devices to set-top
boxes to cell phones. In the mid-1990s the company was under
assault from competitors like Sun Microsystems, Netscape
Communications and the Oracle Corp., which were advocating an
approach called network computing that would have moved processing
power from the desktop to a centralized computer.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Microsoft's new view of computing calls for
processing to be done everywhere, from the desktop to the cell
phone to powerful network computers somewhere on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft took pains Thursday to make the case that the new .NET
strategy would be inclusive rather than exclusive and that it would
offer the new .NET services on competing platforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we a company that is going to suck everything up into
itself?'' said Steven Ballmer, Microsoft's president, rhetorically
defending himself against critics who have challenged the company's
strategy as being proprietary. ``Because of XML you can have a
device on the Internet that does not run .NET software but through
XML it can participate in .NET services.''
</P>
<P>
   But while he and Gates insisted that those services would be
based on an open Internet standard, enabling users with
non-Windows-based platforms like the Palm computer and the
Macintosh to take advantage of them, the two executives
acknowledged that such users would be second-class citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said the ``richest'' interactions with the new .NET
services would require the new Windows.NET operating system.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the vision the company sketched with videotaped
endorsements from executives of hardware and software companies
like Compaq, Dell Computer, Arriba, Loudcloud and others, there was
skepticism among some industry analysts that Microsoft would be
able to rapidly attract other software developers to its vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're leading a parade and asking developers to come with
them, but what happens if nobody joins?'' said David Readerman, a
managing director at Thomas Weisel &AMP; Partners, a San Francisco
investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   But other industry analysts said they were impressed with the
vision the company articulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that despite all the problems they're dealing with
in the courts they still have a vision of the future,'' said Walter
J. Casey, a technol0gy analyst at Banc One Investment Advisors
Corp. in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thursday, Ballmer occupied himself with making the case that
there is a workable business strategy in the array of new products
he said the company would introduce as part of the .NET strategy.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the company would increasingly try to move to a
subscription basis for selling its products but that the existing
packaged software and royalty and licensing schemes would continue
for the forseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   He outlined a series of Internet-based services the company is
creating, including its MSN online service; a version of its Office
software to be called Office.NET; bCentral, a Web portal offering
services to small business, and a version of its Visual Studio
development environment for software developers.
</P>
<P>
   The company hedged its bets only slightly during the day. Gates
said that the bet on the .NET was equivalent to the 100 percent bet
the company placed on its shift to the Internet strategy in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer said he was confident but he realized that the strategy
was still a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bet I feel very confident about,'' he said. ``But it's
a bet.''

 &HT;    HIGH-SPEED, HIGH-RISK INTERNET ACCESS
 &HT;    By Maurice Tamman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you have a high-speed connection to the Internet,
chances are your computer is being attacked daily.
</P>
<P>
   A novice hacker, with some basic networking knowledge, could
easily capture all of your Internet activity, including e-mails and
most log-ons and passwords. Even a neighbor, armed with mild
curiosity, could peek at every file on your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Users can block most attacks by using firewalls and configuring
their systems correctly, but some of the attacks are invisible,
said Lincoln David Stein, author of ``Web Security: A Step by Step
Reference Guide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't rely on your (Internet provider) doing it right,''
he said. ``And people who don't protect themselves could be
wide-open.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not a theoretical problem. The FBI's nine-person
computer crime squad in Atlanta receives several complaints a week
from high-speed Internet customers who believe they have been
victimized by hackers, supervisory special agent David Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes (consumers) don't realize the importance of
firewalls,'' said Ford, who heads the squad. ``Many people do
online banking. ... They have financial data, personal letters and
graphics files that they wouldn't want to share.''
</P>
<P>
   Providers of high-speed Internet access say they are gradually
upgrading equipment to fix many of the security problems. In the
meantime, however, your system could be a theme park ride for
hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, computer programmer David Green wanted to see how
easily his cable company's Internet traffic could be intercepted.
He ran a packet-sniffing program designed to capture data being
transmitted from any computer connected to his cable modem network.
</P>
<P>
   All Internet information undergoes a transformation as it
travels around the electronic universe. It is broken into packets _
small bundles of data _ before being transferred and then
reassembled when it is received. After the packets leave a
computer, however, they can be silently captured and viewed.
</P>
<P>
   Completely invisible to the other users, Green was able to make
a copy of virtually all the Internet traffic over the system. In
one hour, the software collected 20 megabytes of information,
including Web pages, e-mails and dozens of log-ons and passwords.
</P>
<P>
   By configuring the software to search for one Internet address,
he could have viewed everything a specific person was sending and
receiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could easily get into a person's e-mail, read it ... and
the person would never know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those packets could also include information about logging on to
employers' computers and other password-restricted Internet sites
that allow access to remote computers, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Green said, encrypted Web sites _ including banking
and retail sites _ are safe from having passwords stolen from
packets. However, since many people use the same passwords for
everything, those sites could be vulnerable, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Green, speaking of his activities, said: ``Am I going to get in
trouble for this? I don't see why, the cable company is the one
pouring this into my network cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said his five computers were attacked recently when
someone scanned his machines for a specific security hole.
</P>
<P>
   His firewall blocked the attack, and he tracked down the owner
of the Internet address where the attack came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone had broken into his system and was using it to attack
other machines,'' he said. ``Once (the hacker) got on, he
downloaded his (port) scanning software to this guy's machine and
used it to gain access to other machines,'' masking his identity.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Flatt, director of broadband technology for CCS
Technologies in Norcross, said the growth of small-business and
home computer networks has increased the vulnerability
exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he visited a home to inspect a home network and
illustrate some of the security holes in other computers connected
to Charter Communications' cable modem network.
</P>
<P>
   He plugged his laptop into the network and in 15 minutes was
able to download and install a program capable of scanning other
computers connected to Charter's network.
</P>
<P>
   Flatt said cable modem and digital subscriber line users are
particularly vulnerable to such probes because they often use an
Internet number, or IP address, that never changes. In addition,
hackers can narrow their search because the addresses are made up
of a string of four numbers, separated by periods, that are in a
relatively close range.
</P>
<P>
   After five minutes of searching potential IP addresses, the
program found 97 cable company customers' computers.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, about 20 commercial and residential computers were
running software that permitted some level of anonymous access to
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet you most of these guys have no idea what they are
running,'' CCS Technologies' Tim Sunde said.
</P>
<P>
   He focused on a few computers that reported running Windows NT
or 2000, which come with software that enables the computer to
deliver Web pages and other remote access.
</P>
<P>
   He typed in the IP address into his Web browser, and the Windows
default Web page popped on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't even know what they are running,'' Sunde concluded.
</P>
<P>
   He then used another protocol and was able to log on to several
computers anonymously, free to upload and download at will.
</P>
<P>
   Given such access, it would be possible to plant viruses or
other stealth programs on a computer that could give complete
access to the machine by a hacker.
</P>
<P>
   Flatt doesn't believe sophisticated hackers are that interested
attacking small businesses or home users _ they are too busy
breaking into large corporate systems.
</P>
<P>
   Such threats, he said, come from novice hackers, often teens,
who are vaguely familiar with computer networking and can download,
as he did, a few network administrative tools from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some invasions, however, may also come from the least
sophisticated computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Flatt said some cable modem customers are able to browse the
hard drives of other computers connected to their system by
clicking on the Neighborhood Network icon on their PC's Windows
desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, it's harmless because the computer's hard drives are
not accessible.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most users don't know how to set up a network correctly,''
he said. ``These are direct connections to the Internet, with all
the disadvantages and advantages of a direct connection. And if you
don't set it up correctly, you leave yourself wide open to anyone.
They can virtually take control of you entire machine.''
</P>
<P>
   The mistake is to allow a hard drive to be shared across the
network. Sometimes, Flatt said, new computers are delivered with
that feature turned on.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is compounded when residential users install small
networks in their home, allowing families with more than one
computer to share each other's files and printers as well as one
high-speed Internet connection, Flatt said.
</P>
<P>
   If that network is incorrectly configured, or is not
password-protected, other cable modem customers could have complete
access to the family's network.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if a person knew the IP address of the home network's
primary computer, he or she could even browse that hard drive from
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Emmendorfer, a network engineer with St. Louis-based
cable company Charter Communications, said such lapses are the
greatest security threat to all high-speed Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, conveying that message has been left to the cable
modem installer.
</P>
<P>
   In the near future, however, his company will give its customers
a guide to network security that would, in part, explain how to
avoid the most common security mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to rigorously educate our customers,''
Emmendorfer promised.

 &HT;    Fast, furious fun with ``Street Fighter''
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of gamers _ those who still love ``Street
Fighter,'' and those who have long abandoned it to play more modern
3-D fighting games or who never liked the series in the first
place. For the former, there is Street FighterAlpha 3 ($30 for
Playstation, $50 for Dreamcast; www. capcom.com), a jam-packed game
with 33 characters from all the original games, including your old
favorites Chun Li, Ken and Ryu. Both games are extremely playable
old-school fighters. Advantage goes to the Playstation version for
game control (nothing short of an arcade stick beats Sony's Dual
Shock controller), but the Sega Dreamcast version lets you download
and unlock characters, choose character development modes and use
up to three players in a two-on-one match. Whichever version is
chosen, the game, like most of the Street Fighter titles, is fast,
furious action in 2-D cartoon style. Invite some friends over and
start a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Banging one's head against a brick wall and then using the
scattered chunks of mortar to file one's teeth without anaesthetic
is about as much fun as installing Microprose's Gunship! ($50; www.
hasbro-inter-active.com; for Windows). Third in a venerable series
of helicopter sims, the glitchy, buggy, prone-to-freeze Gunship
makes an effort to appeal to action fans and forgoes its roots
entirely. Variable complexity and options ranging from improbably
``realistic'' to aggressively exaggerated effects merely make this
game a gloriously graphic blow'em-up festival, not an aficionado's
technically immersive simulator. Gunship! is a lot of fun when it
is up and running, but getting there is half the problem _ the
other half being the fact that arcade-style flying firefight games
are a dime a dozen.

   ATLANTA _ When does instant messaging stop being a useful tool
for keeping up with your online pals and become one big pain in the
neck _ or even an invasion of privacy?
</P>
<P>
   With so much discussion of privacy on the Net and the potential
of e-commerce sites to take our credit card numbers and pass them
out to every con artist from here to Singapore, the fact that
almost all of America Online's 25 million members can find out if
you're online and send you all kinds of messages for all kinds of
things should be equally disconcerting.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a user logs on to AOL, he or she sees a Buddy List in
the right-hand corner of the screen. Users set up these lists so
they'll know when their friends, family and co-workers are online.
That way you can send them instant messages, real-time notes that
pop up on the left side of your screen.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging is very popular with teenagers who love
chatting online with their friends, and in many households it has
replaced the telephone as the teen communication method of choice.
Teens can talk to each other via ``IMs'' or invite all their
friends to a chat room for a virtual gab session. It's also handy
for companies with far-flung employees to message each other or
hold impromptu meetings when employees are online but not
necessarily in the same city or even the same state.
</P>
<P>
   I have friends who have IM chats with faraway relatives for
hours and rave about the joys of real-time contact with loved ones
that would cost a small fortune if they used the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messages and real-time chat have always been the
``secret sauce'' that separates AOL from other online services,
some of which no longer exist. The minute you log on to AOL, you
most likely will get a perky message telling you that ``you've got
mail'' and, even better, a look at all the people you know who are
online right there with you.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the knee-jerk reaction to seeing that a friend or
colleague is online is to send him or her a chirpy note to say
hello. Just because your friends are online, however, doesn't
necessarily mean they want to talk to you. There's a story that
Charles DeGaulle, the late president of France, had a telephone in
his home that did not accept incoming calls. He reasoned that just
because people wanted to talk to him, it didn't necessarily follow
that he wanted to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   Apply this to the concept of the instant message. Your best
friend may be online, but he or she may be busy talking with
someone else or engaged in some online task, lacking the time to
trade hellos with you.
</P>
<P>
   I send few, if any, IMs these days, and let me tell you why. A
friend of mine tells an embarrassing story about being online with
her boss and a co-worker doing research for a project when her
boyfriend sent her an IM that, from what I understand, isn't the
kind of thing you need your boss to see and probably violated at
least six points of AOL's infamous terms of service. She was
mortified and closed the window as soon as she could, but it was
too late.
</P>
<P>
   Another less dramatic story is the time I came to work one day
to be greeted by a co-worker who said, ``Boy, you were online for a
long time last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, I was online for a long time, doing a variety of things,
some work-related, some not. But what really bothered me was that
the co-worker _ not an especially close friend _ had added me to
his buddy list and knew I was online every time he was online. It
felt like an invasion of privacy and of my right to spend as much
time as I want on the Backstreets Web site reading articles about
Bruce Springsteen, without the whole world _ or just one annoying
colleague _ watching.
</P>
<P>
   Several of my friends lend their screen names to family members,
who are often bewildered by the range of people and messages that
pop up while they're using AOL. I once sent a very chatty, personal
message to a friend and after a while I got a short one-line reply:
``This isn't Linda. This is her mother.'' Oops.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you are tempted to dash off a quick note to
someone, remember that it might not be your buddy you are
messaging. As the old saying goes: ``On the Internet, no one knows
if you're a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Just because you've logged on and discovered all your friends
are online, try to resist the urge to send them an IM. Give your
friends a little space and fight the urge to watch them by closing
the Buddy List ``peephole'' when it pops up. You can also go to the
Buddy List preferences and select how public you wat your online
presence to be. I found that button right after my workplace
encounter.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that buddy lists can't be a fun way to keep
up with your friends and family, but remember, even if it's
somebody you know, you're still being watched, and you can _ and
sometimes should _ control who knows when you're online.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 &HT;    Upon further review, merits of MP3 become obvious
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Driving to work, I often make mental lists of all my
mistakes. I could drive to Oregon and back and still not get bored.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there was the time, at 23, when I bought a $29.95
wig at J.C. Penney with the conviction it would forever change my
life. It did. I looked so weird _ very much like I was wearing a
dead possum _ that I had to move from my native Arkansas in shame.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't done much better with my high-tech predictions.
</P>
<P>
   There was my fearless pronouncement, years ago, that AOL would
soon bite the dust. AOL not only stayed around, it's the world's
largest ISP. Then there was the column in which I explained in
great and logical detail how the telephone companies such as AT&AMP;T
would soon dominate the ISP business. As usual, I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The real experts don't do much better. When I was a kid, Popular
Science put a Buick with wings on its cover, explaining we'd all be
flying to work before long in cars with fold-down wings. Anyone who
tells you he can see the future of technology is either a
multibillionaire or a liar or has to fold down his angel wings to
sleep at night.
</P>
<P>
   So I don't feel too bad telling you I was mistaken when I said
MP3 _ that's the technology that lets you download music right from
the Internet in highly compressed data files _ had the same
prospects for mass success as a polka band.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, I was sincere, logical and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   One of my problems is that I learn best by actually using a
technology on a daily basis. While I had messed with MP3 enough to
know how it works, I didn't spend enough time with it.
</P>
<P>
   I got that chance thanks to my car. It's an aging 1991 Nissan
300ZX that is falling apart at the same pace as its owner. The car
stereo developed a high-pitched squeal that sounded expensive. So I
decided to try MP3 again.
</P>
<P>
   Since I didn't particularly want to search the Internet for
music and download it, I began converting some of my favorite music
to MP3. The software that comes with the MP3 player makes that
easy. You just put a regular music CD in the CD drive of your
computer, and the software converts it to an MP3 file and stores it
in a music library on your hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, I started to understand some stuff I had missed
about MP3. My favorite songs and albums were now on my hard disk.
And the software automatically filled in the names of the artists
and the album name. So, unlike using my CD player at home, I could
search the hard disk for just the kind of music I wanted and
assemble custom playlists easily just by pointing and clicking. I
could assemble playlists that suited my taste, skipping songs that
I didn't like, mixing artists at will.
</P>
<P>
   Even before I transferred the first tunes to my MP3 player
(about the size of a package of cigarettes), I was using the
computer's sound system to listen to my own custom mixes of music
while I typed away at the Great American Novel. It is very much
like owning your own FM radio station and being able to pick the
programming you want, mixing in Cole Porter with Chuck Berry to
suit your own whim.
</P>
<P>
   Then, encouraged by all that, I transferred an hour's worth of
music to the tiny player. That's easy, too. The player comes with a
docking station that attaches to the parallel port of my computer
(the same connection used by the printer). I simply click to select
the tunes I want to transfer, and then _ in a few minutes _ they
are recorded by the MP3 player. The sound quality is terrific.
According to the specs, it isn't as high a quality as that from the
CD player, but I don't hear the difference. And I sure enjoy the
freedom of being my own musical programmer.
</P>
<P>
   That means I can vary the playlist for my morning's drive easily
and quickly. If I want to take the player along on a jog, it's easy
to add music suitable for running _ something with enough oomph to
make me forget I have middle-aged knees.

 &HT;    E-mail service dishes out pearls to make you appear cultured
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Dear Jack,'' the e-mail press release begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``How great would it feel to be surrounded by a group of
intellectual people and impress them with a magnificent fact about
Mozart?''
</P>
<P>
   The mind reels, then conjures a scene at a cocktail party.
Dressed as usual in rumpled sports shirt, patched twill pants and
sock-eating shoes, I casually join a group in evening wear. It's
clear they're already impressed; they're just trying to hide it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's obvious to me,'' a lady in a black dress is saying.
``That particular verse refers to the Beatles in Shea Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps,'' muses a guy in a cummerbund, ``but what do all
those football references mean? I've listened to `American Pie' 200
times, and I've consulted every source I can find, and I still
don't have a handle on that.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, time to drop the bomb on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' I say, cunningly catching their intention. ``Didja know
that Mozart once fainted dead away when he heard an off-key
trumpet? Magnificent, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God,'' sighs black dress. She drifts away. Cummerbund
follows. I'm left with a sharp-faced girl in a black pantsuit and
rimless glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got that from Zooba, didn't you?'' she sneers. ``H.C. Robbins
Landon says that little trumpet story is almost certainly
apocryphal. Who let you in here, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   Zooba (www.zooba.com), according to my breathless ``Dear Jack''
e-mail, ``is the revolutionary link to being a smarter, more
cultured person. It's the online destination when you want to know
more about a particular subject, but you don't have the time to sit
and read a book. Once you become a member of Zooba, it creates and
delivers personalized e-mails, containing rich content based on the
topics that you choose. ... It's a great way to brush up on any
subject and to appear worldly.''
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that anyone who doesn't have time to sit and read a
book could still find time to read one standing up, or is probably
so busy making wheelbarrows full of money that he could afford to
hire a lackey to follow him around, reading a book aloud.
</P>
<P>
   Worldly is easy to do, anyway. I used to do worldly pretty well,
back when I smoked. Worldly people always smoke. French cigarettes
are best, or Picayunes. Do they still make Picayunes? Probably not
since they invented marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Any rate, all you do is put on a trench coat and sit around with
a sullen look and a lit cigarette hanging out of the corner of your
mouth. It takes some practice not to let the smoke make your eye
water, unless you're doing brokenhearted worldly.
</P>
<P>
   And keep your mouth shut. The minute you start blabbering
magnificent facts, you're revealed for what you are _ an unworldly
geek who subscribes to Zooba.
</P>
<P>
   Zooba's press release concludes with this grand aphorism:
</P>
<P>
   ``NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE, YOU CAN ALWAYS BE SMARTER.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You got that right, baby,'' I muttered as I hit the delete
key.

&HT;     WINDOWS ME? WE CAN WAIT
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;     By DWIGHT SILVERMAN    c.2000 Houston Chronicle   Bill Gates
<TEXT>
must be a little short on pocket change, because a new issue of the
consumer version of Windows is on its way, and you have to decide
whether to pony up the bucks for an upgrade.
<P>
   Windows Millennium Edition _ cloyingly nicknamed Windows Me _ is
actually the third version of the Windows 98 operating system. It
also supposedly is the last Windows release that uses the so-called
9x architecture that began with Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime next year, if all goes well, Microsoft will offer a
consumer operating system built around Windows 2000, currently
code-named Whistler. That means the software that will render
Windows Me obsolete is already in development.
</P>
<P>
   It also makes Windows Me the least compelling upgrade for many
Windows 98 users. I've been playing with test versions of the
operating system for months, and with a couple of exceptions, I
don't think there's much here that most folks will find crucial. I
have yet to get my hands on the finished code, but I'll follow up
once I do.
</P>
<P>
   However, Windows Me may be attractive to users who have found
Windows 95 or 98 to be trouble-prone. It has some interesting
features for fixing and, even more importantly, preventing
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Work was completed on Windows Me last week, and it is due in
stores in mid-September. It may find its way onto new PCs before
that. And that's probably the best circumstance in which to get
Windows Me. The operating system's biggest strength is that it has
support for many of the latest hardware components that computer
manufacturers will be offering soon.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has had two main goals for its Windows Me upgrade.
First, it wanted to make it easier to use, and there have been
interface and design changes in that direction. But frankly, some
of the changes make Windows Me harder to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Dial-up Networking folder icon is now gone by
default from the My Computer window. Instead, there's a Web-like
text link to it in small type in the folder. (There's also a text
link in My Network Places, which is the new name for Network
Neighborhood.) But that link is visible only if you have your
folders set to be viewed as Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   So where is Dial-up Networking actually stored? In the Control
Panel _ a bizarre change, since most folks are used to finding it
in My Computer.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, when you first open the Control Panel, most of the
modules there are hidden from you. Again, there's a text link that
reveals all.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also sought to make Windows Me more reliable than
Windows 98 Second Edition. Of course, Windows 98 SE was supposed to
be more crash-proof than Windows 98, which was supposed to be more
stable than Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Users who've religiously followed the upgrade path know that
this has not always been the case. While each successive version
does contain bug fixes and feature improvements, Microsoft also has
added features and thus increased complexity. A clean, simple
installation of Windows 98 is pretty reliable. But once you start
adding things _ like, uh, new software _ this house of cards can
come tumbling down.
</P>
<P>
   However, Windows Me may have an edge here. While the versions
I've been using have been pre-release ones with their share of
bugs, Microsoft argues that Windows Me is going to be more stable
because the company has removed some of the things that could cause
problems in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   There is less support for older MS-DOS programs in Windows Me,
which should raise a warning flag to anyone who still relies on
that type of software. While many DOS programs may still work,
there is less of an emphasis on DOS compatibility in Windows Me.
Whether that translates into increased reliability is something
that will be determined over time.
</P>
<P>
   There are other Windows Me features, though, aimed at helping
users. The built-in help files have been expanded dramatically,
with more automated troubleshooters and links to Microsoft's
support Web site. If the documents on your PC can't help you, you
can easily go online for more information.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 has a little-documented but lifesaving feature that
lets you recover from catastrophic problems. If you do something
that hoses your operating system, but you can still get to a DOS
prompt, you can type scanreg /restore, then choose from several
days' worth of backed-up Windows Registry files. This takes your
Registry back to a point before the damage was done - almost like
traveling back in time.
</P>
<P>
   Windows Me takes this one step further with a feature called
System Restore. It notes changes made to your system over time and
creates so-called Restore Points. You can choose one of the Restore
Points from a calendar. You can go back for days, weeks or even
months.
</P>
<P>
   The operating system also brings over a useful feature from
Microsoft's Office productivity suite. Windows Me has the ability
to replace crucial files that have been either accidentally deleted
or overwritten with older versions. This ``self-healing''
capability seeks to fix one of the biggest causes of program
crashes _ incompatible versions of system files. How well this
works is something that only time will tell.
</P>
<P>
   As with all versions of Windows, there are new features built
in.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, after all, has to do something to keep the Justice
Department busy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you'll find a built-in desktop video editor that
makes it easy to bring in movies from a videocamera and manipulate
them. I spoke with several companies that make and sell software
programs that do this, and they didn't seem worried about Microsoft
adding this new capability to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just calls attention to the category,'' said one company's
spokesman, who apparently wasn't feeling like his firm might be the
next Netscape Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Windows Me wouldn't be a new version of Windows
without at least one feature suffering a solid case of hyperbloat.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows Media Player, once a simple and speedy way to play
media files, has ballooned into a lumbering application that takes
twice as long to load and bristles with unnecessary bells and
whistles.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it now has a Media Guide that helps you ``find
entertaining and informative content on the Internet.'' The last
time we saw a description like that, it was on the Channel Bar on
Internet Explorer 4, which was partially to blame for that
program's bloat. And it went largely unused.
</P>
<P>
   Since an upgrade will cost around $100 _ and since the consumer
version of the more robust Windows 2000 is just around the corner _
chances are many users will take a pass on Windows Me. Gates may
end up a little poorer, but you may be better off waiting.

VERY DEEP POCKETS BACKING MIT PROJECT 
 BY ANY OTHER NAME, IS IT SPAM? 
ROYALTIES SOUGHT ON FORGOTTEN PATENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   After dinner was served to the
elite group of computer scientists assembled at Boston's sumptuous
Bay Tower Room last Tuesday night, professor Juhani Kuusi, chief of
the Nokia Research Center in Finland, made a toast.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We have taken on a great challenge,'' Kuusi said in his
lilting accent. ``Let's do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge Kuusi referred to was Oxygen, a five-year project
headed by Michael Dertouzos, the director of the Laboratory for
Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The
dinner was the first meeting of Oxygen's corporate underwriters.
</P>
<P>
   At $1 million a year for five years, the price of admission to
Oxygen is unusually high, particularly because MIT's computer
laboratory and its sister Artificial Intelligence Laboratory have
long relied almost exclusively on government financing. Those
ponying up are the Acer Group, Delta Electronics, Hewlett-Packard,
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Nokia and Royal Philips
Electronics. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency will
supply an additional $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Oxygen software itself will be in the public
domain, each company hopes to get something different from the
deal. Several officials said they were particularly interested in
MIT's work on computers that respond to human speech. All intend to
work closely with MIT's researchers, and under the deal, will own
the intellectual property rights to anything they invent.
</P>
<P>
   While few would articulate it, beyond a general support for
``open systems,'' one other principle seemed to unite the Oxygen
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   `'Microsoft is too strong,'' said Kenichiro Ishii, deputy
director of NTT's Communication Science Laboratories in Kyoto,
Japan. ``So if the Oxygen project is a strong competitor to
Microsoft, it's exciting to us.''
</P>
<P>
   BY ANY OTHER NAME, IS IT SPAM?
</P>
<P>
   So if you give merchants a green light to spam you, and they do,
have you been spammed?
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, those who make their livings from junk _ or,
in their words, promotional e-mail _ answer with a resounding no.
Now, they say they can prove they are right.
</P>
<P>
   FloNetwork of Toronto, a company that handles promotional e-mail
for merchants, sent e-mail messages to about 1,000 people who
regularly buy things on the Internet to ask their feelings about
spam vs. so-called permission-based e-mail _ messages that go only
to consumers who have clicked the button on a Web page indicating
that they would welcome updates, promotional material and such.
</P>
<P>
   FloNetwork's conclusion? ``People hate spam, but they love
permission-based e-mail,'' said Regina A. Brady, a FloNetwork vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that is overstating it on both sides. Most of the
respondents said they got about 10 pieces of unsolicited
promotional material a week, and only a third of them saw it as a
major invasion of privacy. Two percent actually liked it. But a
majority _ 65 percent _ did not care about it one way or the other;
they just deleted it upon arrival. By contrast, 94 percent of those
responding said they occasionally gave permission to merchants to
send them e-mail. And 58 percent said they thought permission-based
e-mail was an excellent way to learn about products, services and
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Tempting as it might be to think of the surveys themselves as
spam, they were in a sense permission-based e-mail. Those surveyed
were already volunteer members of an online panel that National
Family Opinion uses to gauge the popularity of various internet
sites and methods.
</P>
<P>
   ROYALTIES SOUGHT ON FORGOTTEN PATENT
</P>
<P>
   Dusting off a 14-year-old patent, British Telecommunications is
claiming ownership of the linking technology that lets Web users
move around the Internet by clicking on text and pictures. The
company has begun sending letters to Internet service providers in
the United States asking them to pay royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Patent specialists say British Telecommunications has a
difficult case to prove. But they expect the number of such cases
to rise as people try to apply old and new patents to broad areas
of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   British Telecommunications did not respond to requests for an
interview. The claim was reported last Monday in The Financial
Times, which said the patent was found two years ago buried among
15,000 other patents owned by the company.

BROADCOM'S UNRULY CEO DEMANDS CULTURE OF `COMPLETE FOCUS' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ ``We are not an amorphous sea of communists,''
Henry T. Nicholas III, co-founder of the Broadcom Corp., said,
rolling his eyes in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   He had just arrived at his Southern California office _ forehead
damp from a morning workout, three-piece suit snug against his
6-foot-6 frame _ and already he was ripping into one of his pet
peeves of the new economy: open cubicle space.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Andrew Grove, the Intel Corp. chairman, had a cubicle,
``but it was ceremonial,'' Nicholas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an employee wants to shut his door, he should be able to do
it.'' That is what his colleagues used to do when he worked as a
young engineer in the once-vibrant aerospace industry here in the
Los Angeles region, far from precious Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a lot of things bug Nicholas about the way Silicon
Valley technology companies are run these days _ like executives
who allow employees to bring dogs to work, turning offices into
playgrounds. Or the way venture capitalists have become all but
gods in the new technological order.
</P>
<P>
   But Broadcom, whose engineers design silicon chips that quickly
send voice, data and video over cable lines, has risen to the top
of its game as the photographic negative of a Silicon Valley
company. And its leader is the antithesis of the new age, new
economy Zen master. At Broadcom, as Nicholas makes clear, ``I run
the show.'' Nicholas serves as the company's president and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   In practice that means rousing subordinates from their beds past
midnight when he wants to talk about a project, or dictating the
company's dress code: suits for engineers and managers when
customers visit, and no khakis or jeans. ``We like to think of
ourselves as the anti-Silicon Valley company,'' said Nicholas, who
is known as Nick. ``You are not going to be worshiped here, but you
will spend time getting to build a product that only you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder he is called Darth Vader by fans and competitors
alike. For like Darth Vader, the 40-year-old Nicholas wants to rule
a universe _ in this case the wired universe.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1991 that the former silicon chip designer, who has a
doctorate in electrical engineering, teamed up with Henry Samueli,
his friend and former professor, to start Broadcom. Their timing
was impeccable. The Internet was just taking off and networking
equipment makers needed chips to convert slow-moving analog signals
into faster digital ones.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcom's chips are used in about 90 percent of all digital
television set-top boxes and cable modems, and in about 65 percent
of local area computer networks, analysts estimate. So far, only
Lucent Technologies and Intel's Level One subsidiary have
challenged Broadcom's networking products, and Texas Instruments is
its only rival in cable modems. And Broadcom has taken the lead in
making chips for the burgeoning market for broadband home
networking.
</P>
<P>
   Market share like that is hard to come by. So it is no surprise
that Broadcom was one of the brightest initial public offerings of
1998 _ up 500 percent from its offering price by the end of that
year and up 1,095 percent from its offering through Friday _ making
Nicholas and Samueli, who each own 16 percent of the company, worth
more than $5 billion each.
</P>
<P>
   That competitive advantage could well continue, said Joseph
Osha, senior semiconductor analyst for Merrill Lynch. He predicts
earnings at Broadcom, which has a market capitalization of $35
billion, will grow 125 percent in fiscal 2000 as consumers and
businesses crave more interactive capabilities over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Osha attributes a recent slump in Broadcom's stock price _ down
35 percent from its March high _ to overall technology malaise.
``It's fairly difficult to counter-invade their space,'' Osha said.
Add to that the notion that Internet shopping and entertainment are
fast becoming one, and Broadcom's technology looks even more
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   But Nicholas keeps pressing Broadcom to maintain its edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joke is he gets by on liquid protein and two hours of
sleep a night,'' Osha said, which may not be far from the truth.
Broadcom's corporate culture reflects Nicholas' own tendency to
work 18-hour days until a project is done.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take yourself to the absolute limits of human
behavior,'' Nicholas said, his arms slicing the air in front of
him. ``The whole concept is you leave nothing in reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove his point, Nicholas pulled out a random page from
his running schedule from the summer of 1997 and recounted in gory
detail a day in June when he was so sick he threw up in a patch of
grass and logged that season's worst workout. But 20 days later, he
said with pride, he tied his personal best. ``It was complete focus
on getting a task done,'' he said. ``That is the culture we are
trying to create here.''
</P>
<P>
   And how do the members of that culture respond?
</P>
<P>
   Engineers are attracted to Broadcom for the same reasons they
flock to Silicon Valley: stock options that are worth millions. But
while Nicholas and his currency may attract talent, it is Samueli,
now the company's chief technology officer, who patches up hurt
feelings after Nicholas' frequent expletive-laced tirades.
</P>
<P>
   ``They view me as more their mentor and father,'' the
45-year-old Samueli said. ``I'm there for them to complain to.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi Hatamian, an engineer and project director who has worked
at Broadcom for four years, recalled an incident in late 1996 when
one of the chips his team was designing had a flaw that needed
fixing. Nicholas was displeased with the time it was taking and
called a meeting to tell the team so. For several minutes he raged,
demanding to know who was responsible for the flaw. He finally
turned to Hatamian, who said Nicholas angrily growled, ``You are
responsible for this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nick, did you come here to blame me or get a problem solved?''
Hatamian said he shot back, challenging Nicholas to fire him.
Hatamian then outlined his plan for fixing the chip design, and
after a two-hour grilling, returned to his office and, for several
days, worked until 3:30 a.m. until the problem was fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Even board members have asked him to ratchet down, Nicholas
acknowledged. At a directors meeting last year, he said, some
questioned whether it was wise for their highly visible chief
executive to continue sky diving. He scoffed at the suggestion that
he stop, citing statistics that showed his hobby _ which he
practices several times yearly _ was safe. Besides, Nicholas said
drolly, ``They know if I died it would be the ultimate failure, and
I hate to lose.''

ANALYSIS: MICROSOFT JUDGE SEEKS RATIFICATION IN LATEST RULING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The unexpected order last week to suspend
restrictions on Microsoft Corp.'s business practices until appeals
of its antitrust case are complete held some good news for every
party to the suit. But the true winner was the trial judge who made
the decision, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   For months Jackson had been expressing discomfort at the fact
that he alone was making all the judgments in this important case.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, I am the one decision maker,'' he said in a
late-February interview. ``I would derive some comfort if I could
call on someone else's intellect to assist me.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, on April 4, the day after he found Microsoft in
broad violation of state and federal antitrust laws, the judge told
the litigants that he intended to ``sever the liability and the
remedy'' and encourage appeal of his verdict before imposing a
remedy. But both Microsoft and the government told him they did not
think that was allowed under the law, so Jackson backed down.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with his decision on Tuesday he accomplished something
similar. Now a higher court will have the opportunity to rule on
the merits of the case, ``the liability,'' as Jackson had put it,
before even thinking about the remedy. Sometime in the early fall,
the Supreme Court is likely to decide whether to take the case.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing his remedy ruling on June 7, Jackson had immediately
stayed his order breaking up the company. Had he not decided last
week to suspend a long list of restrictions on the company's
conduct as well, the Supreme Court would quickly have had to wade
into a Microsoft request for a stay, ``and make an immediate
decision on a very complicated subject, drawing them immediately
into the thick of the whole case,'' said Robert Litan, a former
senior Justice Department official now with the Brookings
Institution, a research and policy analysis organization.
</P>
<P>
   And that raises another benefit for the judge. Microsoft has
argued that Jackson made a serious procedural error in failing to
give the company a full hearing before imposing his remedy. Even
some of the plaintiffs think that a higher court might side with
Microsoft on this question. But now the court will have no reason
to consider this issue until the end, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes all the steam out of Microsoft's due-process
argument,'' said Richard Blumenthal, attorney general of
Connecticut, a leader of the states joining the Justice Department
as plaintiffs in the case. ``Now Microsoft will have a full
opportunity to present their views on remedies'' to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, Litan added, ``looks more evenhanded, and now there's
no need for a higher court to admonish him over the remedy-hearing
question.''
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft and the government, however, the results from the
judge's order are more mixed. Microsoft had maneuvered to avoid
having its appeal sent directly to the Supreme Court, where the
company had thought it might have a less favorable audience than
before the U.S. Court of appeals. At that Microsoft failed; Jackson
certified the case for direct appeal in the same order.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft also vociferously opposed imposition of the
constraints on its business that were to go effect in the fall.
They varied from marketing restrictions to product-development
limits. Now these limits are on indefinite hold, and the company
can go about its business.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, most notably, Microsoft announced a major retooling
of its product line to emphasize Internet-based software powering a
variety of devices. Microsoft had postponed the announcement while
Jackson's remedy decision was pending, and said before he granted
the stay that the restrictions he had imposed would be a major
impediment to the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   For the Justice Department and the 19 state attorneys general,
though, Microsoft's ability to go about its business unhindered is
exactly the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really worry about what they are going to do now with nobody
watching,'' said one senior government official.
</P>
<P>
   But several officials, and others, also said that given the
judge's freezing of the remedy the Supreme Court might be more
likely to take the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it makes it easier for them to take it,'' said Tom
Miller, attorney general of Iowa, another leader of the states'
efforts. ``The focus goes much more to liability questions, which
they are probably more comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   Without this order, said another official with knowledge of the
government's case, ``there would have had to be a lot of summertime
activity on the stay request, and that might have prompted them to
buck the whole thing back down'' to the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even without the need to deal with a stay request, the
judge's order ``underscores the need for the Supreme Court to act
quickly, now that Microsoft is not under any sort of conduct
decree,'' said Kevin O'Connor, the assistant attorney general from
Wisconsin who represents the states in court.
</P>
<P>
   But the court can move only so fast under its own rules and is
unlikely to make a decision, even on whether to take the case,
before late summer.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the Justice Department announced that the litigants
had agreed to complete briefings on that question by Aug. 22. After
that, the Supreme Court can decide whether to keep the case or send
it to the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as O'Connor noted, ``in court time, the schedule is
short, but in the market we're talking about, that's a very long
time.''

N.Y. FIRM SUES INTERNET'S DOMAIN ADMINISTRATOR OVER REJECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Already low on cash and facing heavy criticism from
international groups, the Internet's administrative body has been
served with what is believed to be its first lawsuit challenging
its work. The suit was filed by a New York company denied entrance
to the lucrative business of registering Internet addresses, or
domain names.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Afternic.com, which runs a Web site where people
who already own domain names can resell them, filed the suit
against the group, the Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and
Numbers, or Icann, earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The company says Icann violated its bylaws in refusing to
approve Afternic's application to become an accredited primary
registrar for Internet addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Icann was chosen by the Clinton administration in 1998 to run
the Internet's domain name system. And only companies approved by
Icann can offer first-time registrations in the popular domains of
.com and .net and .org.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Icann denied treating Afternic unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Icann believes that it has handled Afternic's application in
an appropriate manner, according to Icann policies and legal
requirements, and consistently with the manner in which other
applications have been handled,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
   During a hearing in federal court in Manhattan last Thursday,
Icann sought to have the case moved to California, where it is
incorporated.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Whelan, co-chief executive of Afternic, said the company
first applied to become an official registrar last October. But he
said Icann had refused to act on the application, citing the
company's involvement in the resale of domain names. Whelan said
Louis Touton, Icann's vice president, told him that Icann was
concerned about the peddling of trademarked domain names in the
secondary market and was holding the application while the board
considered how to deal with those issues.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, the two largest registrars of domain
names, Network Solutions and Register.com, have begun offering
resale services similar to Afternic's, Whelan said. Just last week
Network Solutions announced it would begin auctioning off domains
that were registered but never paid for. And Icann renewed
Register.com's accreditation after it entered that secondary
market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whelan said that while Afternic had met all the criteria that
Icann requires of registrars, Touton had ignored repeated requests
for a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more qualified than 99 percent of the people accredited
to do it,'' Whelan said Friday. ``They don't have the policy to
deny us.''
</P>
<P>
   In its lawsuit, Afternic says Icann has violated its bylaws,
which state that it ``shall not apply its standards, policies,
procedures or practices inequitably or single out any particular
party for disparate treatment unless justified by substantial and
reasonable cause, such as the promotion of effective competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Whelan said his company was seeking immediate accreditation and
damages for lost business.
</P>
<P>
   Icann has approved more than 100 companies and groups to be
registrars. It has never denied one, but does have some, like
Afternic's, on hold while concerns are resolved, an official said.
</P>
<P>
   Icann has been the subject of controversy since its inception.
The group is also facing a revolt from companies that register
names within so-called country codes, two-letter suffixes that
represent geographic regions. Many of those operators are
protesting bills they have been sent to help finance Icann's $5
million budget, saying Icann has never spelled out its legal
jurisdiction over them.

E-COMMERCE: ONLY THE FITTEST SURVIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as this summer's other spectacle of competition and
humiliation, ``Survivor,'' has captured the public's attention, the
great dot-com shakeout has garnered high ratings among
business-minded voyeurs, who are making bets as to which Internet
company will be the next to fall.
</P>
<P>
   As the dot-com survival game unfolds, executives at struggling
Web sites are vying to secure a spot in the next round, which is
widely believed to start sometime around the holiday season. By
then, the reasoning goes, enough of the ``me too'' Internet
start-ups will have died off, ensuring that the survivors receive
more serious consideration from investors.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, for the handful of lucky dot-com executives who
either secured financing before the market dried up, or who enjoy
the backing of a traditional company, these times are nearly as
hectic. As they push their businesses toward profitability, these
executives are watching the shakeout closely for signs of new
competition, while at the same time trying to determine how much to
participate in the weeding-out process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's for sale,'' said Matt Hyde, vice president for
online sales at Recreational Equipment Inc., or REI, the
outdoor-goods retailing co-op.
</P>
<P>
   As with many other e-tailing executives, Hyde said he had
fielded numerous calls recently from competitors looking to be
bought out, or from venture capitalists who are shopping around
various companies that they have invested in, but cannot take
public in this Internet-averse market.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we look at it from an opportunity standpoint _ what are
the assets we could bring to REI? _ we see this as a real
competitive threat, as well,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   The threat changes, of course, from category to category, and
often depends on the extent to which established bricks-and-mortar
brands have made forays into the online world. In April, for
instance, Estee Lauder, which had not yet created an online store
for some of its brands, bought Gloss.com, thereby not only
eliminating an online competitor, but giving Estee Lauder an online
home for other brands within the company and significantly changing
the competitive landscape in the beauty market.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers between Internet-only companies may also put a
significant wrinkle into the power structure of a given market.
Earlier this year, for instance, two Internet companies that cater
to adventure travelers, Greentravel.com and AdventureQuest.com,
merged to create Away.com. The new company, analysts and
competitors said, is much stronger than either of the two sites
that spawned it.
</P>
<P>
   And the merger created better competition for Recreational
Equipment's online adventure travel unit, REI Adventures, as well
as other outdoor sites with travel operations. One such site is
Altrec.com, which sells goods and travel services to outdoor
enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Morford, Altrec's chief executive, said the shakeout
among the Internet's outdoor retailers had led to more distractions
than opportunities. ``Through this wave of consolidation, at least
20 dot-coms have approached us, wanting to be acquired,'' Morford
said. ``Frankly, only two of them were worth talking with for more
than a half-hour.''
</P>
<P>
   But the company has benefited from the shakeout in other ways.
For instance, Morford said Altrec had been in negotiations with Cox
Interactive Media to acquire GreatOutdoors.com, a content and
community site for outdoor enthusiasts, before investors started
fleeing Internet companies early this year.
</P>
<P>
   When the downturn took hold, he said, negotiations suddenly
became easier, and early last month Cox sold the business to
Altrec, while also investing an unspecified amount in Morford's
company. ``If market conditions had been different, the ease of
that deal may not have been there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Spira, chief executive of BareWalls.com, an online
retailer of art prints and posters, said he was not as concerned
about new competitors emerging from the consolidation. If merged
sites ``are starting off bigger, it might help them, because their
buying power could be more concentrated, but that's not everything
you need,'' he said. ``You still have to keep growing and
improving,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the gold rush mentality has puttered out, a lot of
the competitors who were in it for the short term are starting to
step aside,'' Spira said. ``If you were in it for the short term,
adding your business together with someone else's won't make it
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Nandkeolyar, vice president for e-commerce at
Williams-Sonoma, said his company was not in an acquisition mode,
even though competitors like Cooking.com ``have money to burn,'' he
said, and could perhaps use that money to buy up distressed
dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, there's no pressure to go out there and act crazy,''
Nandkeolyar said. ``There's a lot of hype about consolidation, but
frankly, I don't see the benefit of an acquisition. If I look at
the cost of doing an acquisition versus what I could do with that
money to invest in our brand, I'd much rather invest it here.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether he worries about a stronger competitor emerging
from the shakeout, Nandkeolyar said he welcomed competition. ``It's
good for the industry, especially since it's in such a nascent
stage,'' he said. ``We can learn from our competitors, and improve
our own game.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this spring, of course, the competition within most
e-commerce markets has resembled a steel-cage match in professional
wrestling, with a constantly growing cast of characters, and
participants coming up with ever-more creative methods to edge
their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the current e-commerce environment promises to
diminish the number of participants in the dot-com free-for-all,
Nandkeolyar and other executives will, analysts said, have fewer
cues to rely on, as they refine their business approaches. And
perhaps more important, in an investment environment in which the
bottom line is king, some analysts fear that e-tailers will devote
less money and staff to innovations _ at least at the same pace as
they have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Sharples, chief executive of Garden.com, a home and garden
e-tailer, said innovation and competition in different markets
``might well decrease.'' But Sharples, who is the founding chairman
of Shop.org, an industry trade group, said, ``It hasn't yet
affected consumers, and maybe it won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some of the less sturdy Internet concerns may, in fact,
stagnate, he said, the category leaders will not. ``My gut feeling
is that businesses with good models will continue to do smart
investing,'' Sharples said. ``And they will continue to innovate.''

&HT;     YAHOO ADDS NEW SEARCH ENGINE
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC    c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _ In a marriage made in goofy name heaven,
Yahoo Inc. has tapped Google Inc. as its primary search engine.
<P>
   Under the agreement, Google will provide an underlying Web
search engine to Yahoo's Web directory and navigational guide.
Yahoo expects to integrate the services within the next 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the multiyear agreement, announced Monday,
were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo selected Google because they share our strong consumer
focus,'' said Jeff Mallett, president and chief operating officer
of Yahoo. ``Google has clearly demonstrated its ability to scale
with the rapid growth of the Web, making it a particularly good
match for Yahoo as we continue to expand our global presence. We
are very pleased by this agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo had been using the search engine of Inktomi Corp. for
general Internet search queries. Yahoo officials said Monday they
would continue to use Inktomi for corporate search engine
applications.
</P>
<P>
   From Google's end of the deal, this was a match made three years
ago when the company's founders first met Yahoo co-founder David
Filo.

TWO LEADING ONLINE GROCERS MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN COOK   
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The peach has been bagged.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland-based HomeGrocer.com, whose peach-decorated delivery
trucks have become a fixture on the streets of Seattle, was sold
Monday to rival Webvan Group Inc. in a stock deal valued at about
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The merger brings together two of the leading online grocery
stores and positions the company _ to be known as Webvan Group _ as
a powerhouse in the overnight delivery of food, liquor, electronics
and office supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger combines the strengths of the two premier online
shopping and delivery companies both with the capabilities to
deliver the last mile of e-commerce,'' said George Shaheen, chief
executive of Foster City, Calif.-based Webvan.
</P>
<P>
   Both HomeGrocer.com and Webvan have been burning through cash as
they attempt to expand their distribution network, build brand
recognition and change the way consumers shop for everything from
fruits and vegetables to diapers and dog food. But as the two
companies spent heavily to attract customers, investors lost
patience with consumer e-commerce companies. That has caused
consolidation in the online grocery market.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Safeway Inc. invested $30 million in GroceryWorks.com
while Dutch supermarket chain Royal Ahold NV spent $73 million to
bail out struggling Peapod Inc. Westwood, Mass.-based Streamline
Inc., which is backed by Nordstrom and others, announced last month
that it hired an investment bank to explore its financing options.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is out there with a big bag of money handing out cash
to B2C (business-to-consumer) companies,'' said Peter Swan, an
analyst at Pacific Growth Equities in San Francisco. ``So to a
certain extent this merger is a function of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined company, with more than 4,200 employees and 264,000
customers, will have operations in nine markets with plans to
expand into four new cities by the end of the year. By merging
upcoming expansion schedules in Baltimore, Washington, D.C.,
Chicago and Bergen County New Jersey, Webvan will be able to save
between $200 million and $300 million in operational costs and $20
million to $30 million in headquarter and marketing costs. It will
also be able to compete more aggressively against brick-and-mortar
competition such as Albertsons Inc. and Safeway, both of which have
made moves onto the Internet in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the merger both companies had to expend money to win
customers from brick-and-mortar alternatives and then each had to
spend money to win the customer from each other,'' said Shaheen.
``Total spend now can be more directed on brick-and-mortar
competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the possible cost savings, Wall Street reacted
negatively to the news, sending shares of both companies down more
than 14 percent. Webvan fell $1.41 to close at $7.31 while
HomeGrocer.com lost $1.22 to close at $6.88. Both companies have
lost nearly half of their value since issuing shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably surprised the market,'' said HomeGrocer.com Chief
Executive Mary Alice Taylor, commenting on the dip in the stock
prices. ``There is still some digesting of what it means and how it
plays out. But this deal just makes good sense.''
</P>
<P>
   With the capital markets emphasizing profitability and the large
supermarket chains getting more serious about Internet initiatives,
HomeGrocer.com`s Taylor said the merger was a ``no-brainer.'' The
former Federal Express executive who was recruited to lead
HomeGrocer.com in September said the deal came together after
George Shaheen gave her call about six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``George picked up the phone, gave me call and said: `What do
you think?,' '' said Taylor. ``And that is really what got the ball
rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who will not have a management role in the new company,
said it was premature to discuss layoffs at HomeGrocer.com's
Kirkland headquarters. Executives at Webvan said they have made no
decisions about headcount, although it would be looking at
``eliminating headquarter redundancies.'' Plans to open a
350,000-square-foot distribution center in Kent this October are
still on track, said a Webvan spokesman. Meanwhile, the
HomeGrocer.com distribution facility in Renton will be shut down
and employees, most of whom work in delivery and grocery picking,
will be transferred to the new building.
</P>
<P>
   While the two companies Monday touted their similarities, they
have taken alternative paths in the online grocery war. Founded in
an old Bellevue warehouse by three Canadian entrepreneurs,
HomeGrocer.com has focused on quickly moving into markets and
establishing brand recognition. It currently operates seven
warehouses in Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, San Diego and Dallas
and processes about 2,300 orders per day. Delivery trucks park
directly at the warehouses and then in midmorning begin
transporting orders to customers' homes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Webvan, formed by Borders Books founder Louis
Borders, has attempted to build massive automated warehouse
facilities in the 300,000-square-foot range. Using what it calls a
spoke-and-wheel approach, the company transports goods by
semi-truck trailer to smaller distribution hubs where items are
then offloaded onto vans. Drivers deliver goods in a 30-minute
window, compared to 90 minutes at HomeGrocer.com. The company does
not bill itself as an online grocery store, but rather as a last
mile e-commerce provider, delivering everything from patio
furniture to DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts questioned the possibility of combining the two
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   But Shaheen, who will remain chief executive of Webvan, said
bringing together the two companies will ``be quite seamless'' and
will ``dovetail very nicely and smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest online retailer, Seattle's Amazon.com, will
be following the merger closely. Amazon holds a 21.6 percent stake
in HomeGrocer.com and has expressed interest in combining its
retailing operation with delivery services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't to a place yet where Webvan is a direct threat to
Amazon. Amazon is seeing that and didn't want it to come up and
bite them,'' said Adam Hamilton, a research analyst with McAdams
Wright Ragen in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to close in the late third quarter or early
fourth quarter. Webvan will pay 1.076 shares, or about $7.86, for
each HomeGrocer.com share. Jim Barksdale, partner of The Barksdale
Group and an early investor in HomeGrocer.com, will join Webvan's
board of directors.

IF POLLS MEAN MUCH, GORE NEEDS TO FIND A NEW HOUSE SOON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore must be due for another political makeover. It's been
days since the Democratic presidential candidate reinvented
himself.
</P>
<P>
   And look what happened in the meantime: The Republicans'
nominee-to-be, George W. Bush, surged ahead of Gore by 13 points in
the latest USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Bush racked up that lead among ``likely voters,'' according to
USA Today's report on the poll. Likely voters, the paper said, are
those ``whose past voting behavior indicates they are most likely
to go to the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was the choice of 52 percent of likely voters, while 39
percent preferred Gore. And there was more good news for Bush:
Independent voters responding to the poll favored Bush over Gore by
a margin of 57 percent to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Bush outpolled Gore by ``26 points'' in the
crucial category of independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't it just a few months ago that John McCain was running
around the country trying to convince Republicans that only he
could lure independent voters to the Grand Old Party's cause and
defeat Gore in the general election?
</P>
<P>
   But look who's beating Gore like a drum these days. It's not
John McCain; it's George W. Bush, making fools of McCain and others
who insisted that Bush would be hopelessly overmatched by Gore in
the battle for independents.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at the number again: Bush 57, Gore 31.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing.
</P>
<P>
   And here's another amazing number: The poll showed Bush with a
6-point lead over Gore ``among female voters.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not a misprint. Bush is ahead of Gore in the
all-important women's vote.
</P>
<P>
   If this poll reflects anything even remotely resembling reality
_ and there's every reason to assume that it does _ Bush has
effectively erased the Democrats' cherished ``gender gap'' and
created a gender gap of his own.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, that's even worse news than the recent headlines about
his fund-raising shenanigans during the 1996 presidential campaign.
If a Democratic presidential candidate can't carry the women's
vote, he's in big trouble _ especially considering that the poll
gave Bush an eye-popping 20-point lead among male voters.
</P>
<P>
   With every silver lining there's a cloud, of course, so it's
only fair to stop drooling over the poll results for a moment and
consider USA Today's suggestion that Gore might have fared better
if not for the bad publicity about fund-raising. The newspaper
quoted one expert as saying that the fund-raising flap is a
temporary problem for Gore that will quickly evaporate unless
Attorney General Janet Reno appoints a special prosecutor to
investigate _ which she is not expected to do.
</P>
<P>
   The expert also downplayed the value of June polls in predicting
the results of November elections, noting that voters aren't really
paying attention yet. One of CNN's polling wizards made a similar
observation, explaining that polls taken on or around Labor Day are
more likely to reveal the eventual winner.
</P>
<P>
   OK. I can wait.
</P>
<P>
   It's entirely possible that the polls could fluctuate wildly
between now and Nov. 7, leaving us in suspense until the very last
vote is counted. That's not what usually happens, but it's
possible.
</P>
<P>
   A more probable scenario is that both of the major party
candidates will get a ``bounce'' from the upcoming nominating
conventions and that the race will tighten during August and early
September. Then one of the candidates will surge to a significant
lead and hold that lead _ or widen it _ as the election approaches.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days before the voters go to the polls, the
candidate who's behind will edge closer to the leader _ and then
fall back again as undecideds swing to the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Being a Bush-backer, I'm guessing that his summer lead will hold
up and that Gore will be the one giving futile chase in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore is ahead in the final days, of course, then my whole
scenario is out the window, and Bush comes from behind to snatch
victory from the jaws of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   It's the one thing I'm sure about: Bush wins.

   Nine years ago, Sebastian Junger (pronounced ``younger'') was
hanging from a tree on a hot summer day, looking at the bloody tear
he had just ripped down the back of his leg with his chain saw,
when the idea for his book blossomed. Cutting trees, he mused, was
difficult work, like firefighting, logging or commercial fishing.
Why not a book about those jobs?
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, three storm systems collided off the coast of
New England, creating a meteorological debacle so disastrous, and
so improbable, that a weatherman dubbed it a ``perfect storm,'' or
a storm that could not have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the maelstrom of 100-mph winds and 90-foot waves, a
72-foot swordfishing boat out of Gloucester, Mass., called the
Andrea Gail went down with her crew of six. Junger, then living in
Gloucester, clipped a newspaper article about the missing vessel,
which was never found.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Sebastian Junger, 38, a Belmont, Mass., native, became
chronicler of that 1991 fishing disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, what started out as a chapter on fishing had
turned into a whole book, ``The Perfect Storm.'' Suddenly, Junger
was the Sexiest Author in America, and the book was a publishing
marvel being aggressively optioned by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   As publishing leaders see it, it was Junger's own willingness to
stump for the book, coupled with his publisher's savvy marketing
strategy, that led to the book's singular success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, it didn't hurt that he was very good-looking,'' says
Daisy Maryles, executive editor of Publishers Weekly. ``These days,
when a publisher looks at an author, obviously, they consider the
manuscript, but they're also looking at the kind of publicity the
author can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Publisher W.W. Norton says it wasn't because of Junger's
appearance or manner. It was because of his obsession with his
subject. Norton is a prestigious publishing house known for
literary quality and a traditional interest in nautical topics.
When Junger approached Norton, he was an unknown. He had never
written a book. He had written only a handful of pieces for such
magazines as Men's Journal and American Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   And his book proposal had been turned down by a dozen publishers
who did not see how a book could be written about a storm. But
Starling Lawrence, Norton's editor-in-chief, sat down with Junger
in his Manhattan office and liked him immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an obsessional quality to his interest in the
material that I liked,'' says Lawrence, who gave Junger a $35,000
advance. ``Obsession is always an interesting, maybe essential,
quality in a writer. I personally am not interested in books that
don't have to be written.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Junger's obsession was his nature. He tends to fixate.
But part of it was that he had once had a near-drowning experience
himself while surfing on Cape Cod, and the sensation of water
pressing against his lungs had been seared into his memory.
</P>
<P>
   Junger's book is a combination of reportage and deduction: He
tells a compelling and factual human story of the fishermen's lives
leading up to the departure of the boat, as well as that of others
who survived the fateful storm. But he also plunges deep into
imagination to narrate what might have happened in the Andrea
Gail's final hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm'' is chock-full of information about such
things as how human beings drown, and waves form, and boats are
built, and hurricanes crest. One of the most riveting sections of
the book describes in unflinching detail the fishermen's probable
final moments as their boat sank, after Capt. Billy Tyne's final
radio transmission: ``She's comin' on boys, and she's comin' on
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Junger's best guess as to what happened:
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew of the Andrea Gail either have laryngospasms or
completely inundated lungs. They are suspended, open-eyed and
unconscious, in the flooded enclosures of the boat. The darkness is
absolute and the boat may already be on her way to the bottom. At
this point only a massive amount of oxygen could save these men.
They have suffered, at most, a minute or two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason this book is so good is we know so much more about
the weather _ all this scientific information. The weather is a
principal character in this book,'' says Peter Davison, former
editor at Houghton Mifflin and currently poetry editor for The
Atlantic Monthly. Junger ``is also willing to go the final mile and
tell how people die. Most people end with a cry _ and the mate was
washed off to starboard and never seen again _ and that kind of
crap. Junger really deals with this. It is a brave book.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm,'' published in May, 1997, has sold just
over 2.5 million copies. (It has since been made into a movie, of
the same title, that is due out in July, and features heartthrobs
George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg.)
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times and The Washington Post ran glowing reviews,
as did many others. National Public Radio alone did five interviews
with him, and People magazine did three stories, the last of which
dubbed him one of the Sexiest Men Alive (author division). He was
on ``Good Morning America'' twice, CNN three times, and made
appearances on Charlie Rose, ``CBS Sunday Morning,'' Tom Snyder,
CSPAN and Fox News. And then Oprah waved him into a chair along
with several other of People's Sexiest Men Alive. One writer dubbed
the show ``Hunk Writers With Less Substance Than Their Books.''
</P>
<P>
   Junger balked. He did not want to do it. He did not have a suit.
His chain saw needed oiling. People would think he was using the
book, he says, ``to catapult myself into some weird, glamorous fame
world.'' But Norton editor Starling Lawrence presented Oprah to
Junger in a different light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawrence said, `Look. The amount of book sales we're going to
get from this, the amount of money we're going to get from this, is
huge. And you may not feel like you need the money' _ and I did
feel that way _ `but we're a business, and the more money, the
better for us.' He said, `You know, it will allow us to publish a
lot of guys like you, what we thought you were. And that struck
home. I said OK.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, Junger had done 134 interviews, most with
the national media, four of them online. He had participated in 46
book events and traveled to 40 locations on tour. And reporters
loved him. ``He's affable and enthusiastic, articulate, charming,
frank, modest but not overmodest, romantic but not hopelessly so.
God, isn't there anything wrong with this guy?'' gushed Britain's
Manchester Guardian.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's brave. He's built. He's literate,'' exclaimed New York
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, love letters and marriage proposals poured into
Norton's office by the fistful. And now the former tree-cutter and
would-be journalist who could barely get his stories published, was
transformed into The Perfect Author.
</P>
<P>
   It seems significant that Junger did not have a girlfriend in
high school. Now, Junger's life could easily be divided into Before
the Book and After the Book. And not having a girlfriend seemed to
symbolize many of the things he felt he could not have before the
book.
</P>
<P>
   Junger, in fact, started out with a healthy portion of the
conventional ``good things.'' Although he has been lionized in the
media as a kind of wrangler writer, Schwarzenegger with a laptop,
Junger was raised in the prosperous suburb of Belmont, the son of
an artist and a physicist. He attended tony area schools before
graduating from Wesleyan University in 1984 with a degree in
cultural anthropology and, at last, a girlfriend. His book is
dedicated to his father, ``who first introduced me to the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, in fact, the very tameness and predictability of his
suburban youth that drove him to build a lean-to in the woods _ ``I
didn't want to kill things, but I wanted to know that I could if I
wanted to'' _ and to scale 100-foot trees with his chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   Junger wandered for several years, trying to launch a writing
career without success. Newspapers turned him down. He wrote some
stories for an alternative paper in Washington, D.C., and for The
Boston Phoenix. He waited tables at the old Casablanca restaurant
in Cambridge, Mass., to pay the bills, then wandered down to New
Orleans and tried his hand at fiction. But after six years, ``the
writing thing was going nowhere. And I wanted it so bad. It was
like trying to get a girlfriend in high school. I was like, `What
is wrong? Why won't this connect?'''
</P>
<P>
   And then, one day in 1989, he sat down at a bar next to a guy
who offered him a job cutting down trees. And things began to
connect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it immediately,'' says Junger. ``I felt, here I have
something which is exhausting, which makes you incredibly dirty,
and you're doing something very scary and that can kill you. And at
the end of the day, you've won. The tree is a stump. A huge dead
oak over this person's house is a stump. Through a mix of machinery
and brute strength and athletic ability and engineering, you have
brought this thing down. It is a tremendous feeling. I fell in love
with it immediately and actually had a hard time giving it up as I
got more into writing.''
</P>
<P>
   And he hasn't, altogether. There is the chain saw, after all,
right there on the bare wooden floor of his two-bedroom apartment
in Manhattan's East Village. (Junger moved to New York from Cape
Cod midway through writing the book, because, he says, he needed a
change.)
</P>
<P>
   There's a picture of him pressing the saw into a 90-foot tree.
It is tacked to the wall, right next to the picture of Ethel
Shatford, bartender at the Crow's Nest, the Gloucester bar that
anchors ``The Perfect Storm,'' and the mother of one of the men who
died on the Andrea Gail.
</P>
<P>
   Junger became close to Ethel Shatford during the countless hours
he spent talking to fishermen in the Nest. In writing the book, he
wrestled with whether to include details of the men's drowning,
thinking largely of its impact on Ethel. In the end, he did
describe their deaths, and Junger later wrote her a letter
explaining why. ``I didn't want her blindsided,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the book came out, he started a fund to help the
children of commercial fishermen, called ``The Perfect Storm''
Foundation, and he remains closely involved.
</P>
<P>
   Junger sold the paperback rights to his book for $1.2 million
and made another $500,000 on film rights, although he will not say
how much more he has made on the book.
</P>
<P>
   His third-floor apartment, at a $2,500 monthly rent, counts as
one of the handful of things his new wealth has allowed him. He
bought a sailboat for $4,000. And an 1820s farmhouse in Truro,
Mass. He is also planning on opening a bar in Manhattan in June,
with some friends, that will have a ``journalistic'' theme.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Junger's first book has also garnered a host of
writing assignments he could not have dreamed of before. He's
written several pieces for Vanity Fair, one about the forensics
being practiced at the mass graves in Kosovo, another about the
mysterious death of a Greek shipping magnate's son, called
``Addicted to Danger.'' He wrote ``The Lure of Danger: Confessions
of an Adrenaline Junkie'' for Men's Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, he will drive from Brussels to Sierra Leone to
deliver a school van and will write about it for The New Yorker. He
is currently working on a piece for Vanity Fair about Albert
DeSalvo, the man who claimed to be the Boston Strangler and who,
once upon a time, did some carpentry for Junger's parents. He has
an idea for a new book but says only that ``it will surprise people
that I did it, but they will understand by the time they are
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fame and fortune that have come his way, however,
many who know him say that he has been little changed by his new
status.
</P>
<P>
   Junger, they say, remains a rogue adventurer who far prefers his
worn jeans and tattered black T-shirt to the pressed shirts he
grudgingly dons for public appearances.

TEXAS BAPTISTS MAY CUT FUNDING OF SOUTHERN BAPTIST CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas Baptists will not split with the
national Southern Baptist Convention, but doctrines adopted by the
body's conservatives this month have driven a deep wedge between
the state and national groups, moderate Baptist leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   Many Texas Baptists are distressed over the revised Baptist
Faith and Message, which they say exalts the Bible over Jesus. The
independent state convention may cut back on the more than $40
million it sends annually to the national convention.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the moderate-dominated state convention has cut
about 2 percent of its offerings to the national body but still
contributes 33 percent of its money to Southern Baptists, Texas
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas moderates have reacted to the rightward turn of the
national denomination in recent years by creating their own
seminary programs at Baylor University and other schools. They also
finance some of their own mission programs and church literature,
and allow churches to freely contribute to moderate national
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Texas does not plan to form an alternative national
denomination, said the Rev. Charles Wade of Arlington, executive
director of the 2.7 million-member state convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Southern Baptist Convention's recent revision of its basic
statement of faith underscores the need for the Baptist General
Convention of Texas to redefine its relationship with the Southern
Baptist Convention, not cut all ties and start an alternative
national body,'' Wade said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Baptist General Convention of Texas ... will continue
working with Southern Baptists where we can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While there are some conservatives who ``would like to draw a
dividing line as deep as the Grand Canyon, this is a time for
redefining our relationship, not severing it,'' Wade said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas moderates find it difficult to halt support of some
denomination programs, especially its huge missionary effort, Wade
said.
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing national president Paige Patterson said, ``The reason
they have to talk in terms of redefining rather than exodus is for
the simple reason they would lose too many churches.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to predict what consequences a funding reduction from
Texas would have, Patterson said. About 14 percent of the
denomination's $159 million budget comes from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would think that other state conventions would take up the
slack,'' Patterson said. ``But even if it hurt financially, we
would not change what we believe is true and right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Clyde Glazener of Fort Worth, president of the Baptist
General Convention of Texas, said, ``We have not split from the
Southern Baptist Convention; they have split from us.''
</P>
<P>
   The revised Baptist Faith and Message Statement ``would not be
Baptist at all if someone had not insisted they put back in the
statements on priesthood of the believer and soul liberty,''
Glazener said.
</P>
<P>
   The revised statement bans women pastors and includes earlier
additions stating that women should submit to the ``servant
leadership'' of their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   But greater arguments erupt over the removal of statements from
the 1963 version, stating that Jesus ``is the criterion by which
the Bible is interpreted.'' Conservatives argue that the statement
gave liberals a rationale for altering the meaning of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Glazener, pastor of the Gambrell Street Baptist Church in Fort
Worth, said removing Jesus as the highest revelation is putting the
law above God.
</P>
<P>
   When the state convention meets in the fall, Glazener predicted,
Texas Baptists will reject revisions in the 2000 faith statement
and again reaffirm the 1963 declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Some moderate Texas Baptists have suggested that the 2.7 million
members form a Texas-based Convention of the Americas which would
take in moderates from churches in North and South America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already said we are not planning to start a Convention
of the Americas,'' Wade said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Miles Seaborn of Fort Worth, founding president of the
Southern Baptists of Texas, a conservative alternative to the
Baptist General Convention of Texas, said he believes the moderates
are preparing to form a separate denomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The components are in place to do it sooner or later,''
Seaborn said. ``They are doing it a step at a time. If they did it
too abruptly too many would be shocked.''

SUPREME COURT DECISION PERMITS ELIAN GONZALEZ TO RETURN TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to issue an order to keep
Elian Gonzalez in the United States, clearing the way for the
6-year-old boy to return home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court order prohibiting the boy from leaving will
expire at 4 p.m. Wednesday, allowing Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, to take his son home. A chartered plane was waiting at
Dulles International Airport in Washington to carry Elian and his
family and friends back to Cuba. Federal marshals will escort the
boy from a suburban Washington home to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse order released just after noon EDT, the Supreme Court
said that it would refuse to review the case. The high court also
refused to extend an appeals court order keeping Elian in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued at sea on Nov. 25, three days after the boy,
his mother and 12 others left Cuba for Florida in a small motor
boat. Elian and two adults were saved after the boat capsized, but
the boy's mother, Elisabet, and 10 others died.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, was given
temporary custody of the boy and moved him into his Little Havana
home. But Elian's father requested that his son be returned to him,
touching off the battle for custody of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Elian quickly became the focus of demonstrations on both sides
of the Florida Straits. In Cuba, President Fidel Castro stirred up
demonstrations to demand that Elian be returned to his father, who
quickly became a symbol of loyalty to the communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Cuban-Americans rallied to keep the boy in the
country, arguing that his mother had given her life so her son
could grow up in freedom. Others in Miami attached religious
significance to Elian's migration to Florida, saying that the
intercession of the Virgin Mary had saved the boy and that it would
be a violation of God's will to return the boy to a totalitarian
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Custody of the boy also became a political issue. Although a
majority of Americans supported returning the boy to his father,
Florida may be a key state in the fall presidential election and
the Cuban-American community is a potent voting bloc in Florida.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In January, the Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled
that Elian belonged with his father and should be returned to Cuba,
denying a request by Lazaro Gonzalez that the boy be granted an
asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But Elian's great uncle filed a federal lawsuit to overturn the
decision of the Immigration Service. As the court fight dragged on,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez traveled from Havana to Washington on April 6
with his new wife and their son to take custody of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives, however, balked at giving up the boy,
even after his father agreed that he would not leave the country
until the court case was resolved. When the Miami relatives ignored
an order from Attorney General Janet Reno to give up the boy, Reno
ordered a raid on the Miami home by armed federal officers.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has remained in the Washington area since he was taken
from Miami as the case made its way through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld the denial of the amnesty hearing, but ordered the boy to
remain in the country as the relatives filed an appeal with the
full Court of Appeals. That appeal was also denied on June 23, and
the Miami relatives were given just five days to win an emergency
stay from the Supreme Court.

&HT;     `PATRIOT' GAMES CREATE A REVOLUTIONARY BORE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mel Gibson's new movie goes where most vanity projects fear to
tread: 1776.
</P>
<P>
   But that's all right; he's gone there with sci-fi action
director Roland Emmerich calling the shots. So the result, despite
the puffy white shirts, mussed ponytails, 13-starred American flags
and nameless slaves, feels more like 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriot'' makes the Revolutionary War look like
super-produced studio footage of the Los Angeles riots made
suitable for broadcast on VH-1: a cacophony of THX-level stabbing,
shooting and shrieking too arbitrary, too anonymous to be visceral,
though the dusks, the dawns and billowing puffs of gunsmoke seem
designed to complement the azure in Gibson's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The film's would-be money shot stars a cannonball swiping a head
clean off a Yank's body. But that's the kind of special-effects
crotch-grabbing that's good only in hindsight (or DVD) when you can
replay it at an eighth the speed like a megaplex Zapruder film.
Most of the battle sequences are about as hard to figure as the
``Soul Train'' scramble board, and less suspenseful, too.
</P>
<P>
   Easier to keep track of is Gibson, particularly in full
slow-motion gallop, bringing his usual frighteningly intense
horsepower to the character of Benjamin Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Widower, plantation owner, amateur home craftsman, staunch
pacifist, this American and proud father of seven finds himself
caught in the madness of war and the cross hairs of principle when
one of his boys is shot in the back by a simpering, glacial,
blood-lusting British colonel named William Tavington (Jason
Isaacs). Tavington descended upon the Martin property, flanked by a
small army of redcoats, to seize his oldest son, Gabriel (Heath
Ledger), a Yankee soldier who's been pegged as a spy.
</P>
<P>
   A child murdered, another kidnapped, his house torched, his
slaves pocketed, Benjamin sheds his conscientious-objector status
and reacquaints himself with his violent French-and-Indian-War
days, electing to go medieval in order to get Gabriel back and
avenge his dead son. The film gives up on being a war epic and
turns instead into a long evocation of Mel Gibson titles like
``Lethal Weapon,'' ``Ransom,'' ``Braveheart,'' ``Payback,'' ones
that Gibson is eagerly willing to personify. But the script holds
no challenging obstacles for him to overcome to get to Tavington;
it protracts the inevitable with queasy weddings and militiamen
camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a trace of elegant filmmaking in ``The Patriot'' _
that fuses historical fiction and pulsing drama with a competent
vision and moral resonance _ it's the rescue sequence, in which Ben
instills his two other sons with the right to bear arms. It's a
challenge the boys fulfill with nervous mettle, heeding dad's motto
(``Aim small, miss small,'' kind of a ``keep it simple, stupid''
for the junior marksmen set). They're naturals, taking out redcoats
with a sharply shot devotion. But it's only here, as extras fall to
the ground, that you are compelled to question the consequence of
two kids and their dad knocking off 20 men.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the only passage in ``The Patriot'' where the
choreography of chaos is comfortably wedded to technique. It's
ugly, it's raw, it's charged. Otherwise, we get a degree of
jingoism unseen since ``Armageddon'' or Emmerich's ``Independence
Day,'' a piece of toy-cinema that was having fun in the wrong
places. The ``Patriot'' script, by ``Saving Private Ryan'' writer
Robert Rodat, is a curiously timid, vapid comic strip, which leaves
Emmerich ample room to bombard us with a bevy of boldly unsubtle
images that make Armageddon's ``America Rules!'' message seem
subliminal.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, a loud stink has already been made of how the
historical inaccuracies in the script make the British into inhuman
figments of terrorism, not unlike portrayals of Arabs. What with
the characterization of Lord Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson), who rivals
Liberace in his love of primping, preening and florid housecoats,
plus a host of fey-accented people saying things you'd expect to
read in inter-titles of King Vidor silent films, they have a case.
</P>
<P>
   But in a Revolutionary War flick with nary a revolution, where's
the news? When it comes to nationalism and racist caricatures, is
there any better colonizer than Hollywood? Should you expect more
from a director whose last film was ``Godzilla''?
</P>
<P>
   I had a better time at ``The Patriot'' imagining that while
Gibson sits in front of what looks like Yoda's swamp and talks
about his massacre of French troops, the British have returned to
their Industrial Light and Magic space pods for an evening of
glowing green tea.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in the ``Who's the biggest victim sweepstakes,'' the
British in the film are going to have to stand behind the African
slaves. Since the death of her mother, Susan, the youngest Martin
child hasn't spoken. That loss must have had a worse effect on the
slaves, who are so cordial and upbeat about having their lives and
property gentrified in 1776 that you fear for the entire future of
the blues. After the British burn Benjamin's sister-in-law's (Joely
Richardson) house, she and the kids move into the escaped slave's
beach haven, where the intruded-upon say nothing but do host
weddings, dance and house and feed them. They're a compliant
wallpaper background. But then, so is the war.

&HT;     HISPANICS FINALLY GET SOME AIR TIME, ON CABLE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Television has the capacity to be important. At times, that
capability rises to the level of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   But not like this. It shouldn't be like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resurrection Blvd.'' has more pressure on it than any show
deserves. Television shows should worry about merely surviving,
preferably while being entertaining, amusing and/or
thought-provoking. Television shows should worry about attracting
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   What television shows should not have to worry about is carrying
the hopes and expectations of an entire culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resurrection Blvd.,'' which debuted Monday on Showtime, should
be judged as it is: a solid family drama with the potential to get
even better.
</P>
<P>
   But because its cast and crew are almost entirely Hispanic _ a
group grossly underrepresented on television _ ``Resurrection
Blvd.'' takes on greater symbolism and meaning: This show has to
make it. It can't be just OK; it must be a trailblazer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute that a Latino show fails, it has to withstand
greater scrutiny and go through greater challenges, unlike
(predominantly white shows) ... because we are so far back,'' said
Felix Sanchez, president and co-founder of the National Hispanic
Foundation for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Around this time last year, various protests surged together
into a howl when African-Americans decried their
underrepresentation on television. Network and studio executives
had no choice but to listen, and scrambled to add blacks to their
airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   A happy ending? Not for Hispanics, whose calls for more roles
and behind-the-scenes jobs went largely unheard. While Hispanics
comprise 12 percent of the population _ a percentage growing
rapidly _ they make up about 1 percent of the faces seen on
television, Sanchez said. Hispanics can literally count the
characters on one hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Latino community, this is our Selma; this is our
moment to take the seat at the front of the bus,'' Sanchez said.
``This is a civil-rights issue in the media age. Whether people
like it or not, we are in a segregated media world, completely
impenetrable to Latino actors and behind-the-camera talent.''
</P>
<P>
   It's getting better. Then again, how could it get any worse?
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``Resurrection,'' Nickelodeon introduces ``The
Brothers Garcia'' on July 23; the show is being billed as the first
English-language sitcom with an all-Hispanic cast and team of
writers, directors and producers. (Showtime introduced another
minority family drama, ``Soul Food,'' on Wednesday. Based on the
1997 Vanessa L. Williams feature film by the same title, the drama
tracks a multi-generational black family in Chicago.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the most part the networks have not opened many doors
for Hispanics. (One notable exception this fall is Ruben Blades on
ABC's ``Gideon's Crossing.'') ``An American Family,'' a Hispanic
family drama, did not make the final cut for CBS' schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resurrection Blvd.'' falls into the tradition of ``Price of
Glory,'' a feature film released earlier this year starring Jimmy
Smits as an ex-boxer trying to capture the title that eluded him as
he trains three young men. (It was a box-office bust.)
</P>
<P>
   Like that movie, the new series delves into the Hispanic family
structure, and how boxing is revered within that minority
community. The series focuses on the Santiagos of East Los Angeles,
and particularly Carlos (Michael DeLorenzo, ``New York
Undercover''), a middleweight contender. Cheech Marin and Paul
Rodriguez also star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resurrection Blvd.'' will be met with some jabs from within
the Latino community for perceived stereotypes of its own, from the
patriarchal family structures to the presence of gangs and guns and
the clan that looks to boxing as the primary path out of the
barrio.
</P>
<P>
   When you get one shot, why not present nothing but the best of
your community? The answer, of course, is when you get one shot,
the first order is to make it as compelling and as realistic as
possible. And guess what: The stereotypes are sometimes _ but only
sometimes _ true.
</P>
<P>
   While the presence of African-Americans on television is
comparable to their percentage of the population, many are
segregated into a few ``black'' shows. Similarly for Hispanics, a
true sign of change will come when more Hispanics appear as
regulars in shows like ``ER,'' ``The Practice'' or _ say it ain't
so _ ``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   And that day will come, not because it is the right thing to do,
but because it is the wisest business move. There's a huge market
that is waiting, no, begging to be tapped. And some new stories
couldn't hurt the rest of us, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very soon, we will have a fierce bidding war to bring on new
Hispanics images on every level,'' Sanchez said. ``The biggest
issue is no one knows how to successfully tap into this market.''
</P>
<P>
   Someday, someone will figure it out _ and the pressure will be
off.
</P>

US TEAM MISSES INJURED GOALIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ No one on the US team is happy to be playing
the Gold Cup without Briana Scurry, its No. 1 goalkeeper. You don't
lose your Olympic gold medalist and World Cup winner to a severe
case of shin splints and smile about it.
</P>
<P>
   But if there's a bright side, it was on glowing display Tueday
night as stand-in Siri Mullinix got another chance to show why she
should join Scurry on the 2000 Olympic team, shutting out the
Olympic bronze-medalist Brazilians, 0-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure's always there,'' said Mullinix, a 22-year-old
who helped the University of North Carolina to a pair of NCAA
championships and was one of the last cuts going into the World
Cup. ``You just kind of take it day by day and play; that's all you
can do. Today was a great day.''
</P>
<P>
   Few would disagree. By night's end, Mullinix _ whose only
failure was trying to suppress her delighted grin after the game _
had notched five saves and a lot of miles with her aggressive,
out-of-the-goal, fear-no-enemy-foot style. What some see as risky
business, she sees as shot prevention, refusing to hang back and
let the team take shots anywhere in the vague neighborhood of the
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the ball's going back there, you're not worried about
what's going to happen,'' said veteran teammate Kristine Lilly.
</P>
<P>
   It is, Mullinix said, exactly the way she played in college,
when she started for three years before graduating last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just takes time to get back in the groove,'' explained
Mullinix, once again getting used to going out for a ball and being
two inches away from an attacker before kicking it under her foot,
something she knew from watching film would be needed against the
Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing in goal is games. The more games you play,
the better your timing is going to be. Playing one game a month
doesn't help; playing 12 games in three months does. I think (this)
was my best performance yet. I felt confident in every decision I
made.''
</P>
<P>
   April Heinrichs, the first-year US head coach, obviously feels
that same delighted confidence. ``It gives me goosebumps to look at
her little face over there because she's so happy,'' said
Heinrichs. ``She knows she played well. She knows she played high
behind our defense and she knows she had a critical impact on
tonight's outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the 12th cap for Mullinix, who made her first
international appearance May 2, 1999, in a 7-0 win against Japan.
Although she earned a spot in residency camp before the World Cup
after her stellar career at powerhouse UNC and has played for four
years on the US Under-20 team, she had to watch the World Cup from
the stands after barely missing the squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard, but I think it paid off,'' she said. ``I knew
that I was young. I think the timing is perfect right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, Heinrichs hinted at agreement. ``She has stepped through
the door,'' said the coach, asked about her young keeper's bid for
Olympus. ``In some ways, she is kicking the door wide open.''

BOY SCOUTS CAN BAR GAY MEN FROM BEING TROOP LEADERS, HIGH COURT
RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Wednesday narrowly upheld the
right of the Boy Scouts to bar gay men from becoming scout leaders
and, by extension, barred gay boys from joining the scouting ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 decision reversed a ruling by the New Jersey Supreme
Court that arose from Monmouth County, where James Dale was
expelled from the Scouts a decade ago after his troop learned from
a newspaper article that he is gay.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's opinion by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist held
that requiring the Scouts to have Dale in their ranks would violate
the organization's First Amendment right of ``expressive
association.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By all accounts, Dale was an exemplary Scout,'' the opinion
noted. ``In 1988, he achieved the rank of Eagle Scout, one of
Scouting's highest honors.''
</P>
<P>
   After entering Rutgers University, Dale participated in
gay-rights activities, and soon thereafter Scout officials revoked
his adult membership. At the time of his expulsion, he was an Eagle
Scout assistant scoutmaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not, as we must not be, guided by our views of whether
the Boy Scouts' teachings with respect to homosexual conduct are
right or wrong,'' the court said Wednesday. But, it continued,
``Public or judicial disapproval of a tenet of an organization's
expression does not justify the state's effort to compel the
organization to accept members where such acceptance would derogate
from the organization's expressive message.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy
and Clarence Thomas were also in the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. In his opinion, Stevens
focused on the scouting precepts of being ``morally straight and
clean.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is plain as the light of day that neither one of these
principles...says the slightest thing about homosexuality,''
Stevens wrote. ``Indeed, neither term in the Boy Scouts' law and
oath expresses any position whatsoever on sexual matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the absence of explicit wording on sexual matters, Scout
officials have argued all along that gay people have no place in
their membership.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia seemed to signal his view when the arguments in Boy
Scouts vs. Dale, No. 99-669, were heard on April 26. ``To require
the Boy Scouts to have as a scoutmaster someone who embodies a
contradiction of their message _ how can that be?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the Boy
Scouts were a ``public accommodation'' and thus not protected by
the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of association.

US DOESN'T SELL BRAZIL SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL SMITH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The road to world soccer supremacy doesn't
have a ``No Passing'' sign.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, the US women will win the 2000
Gold Cup when they return to Foxboro Stadium for the tournament
final July 3. Then the defending world champions will go to Sydney
and bring home the Olympic gold medal, just as they did four
summers ago in Atlanta. Once again they'll be on top of the world.
</P>
<P>
   It's been that way for much of the past decade, the US setting
the pace while the rest of the world reluctantly follows. In recent
years, however, the Norways, Chinas, and Brazils of the world have
been flashing their high beams, showing they're ready for the US to
get out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   But the world champs aren't quite ready to oblige. Heading into
Tuesday's Gold Cup match at Foxboro Stadium, the US had beaten
Brazil five straight times by a combined 18-2. Of their previous 13
meetings, Brazil had been shut out six times.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled, because the Americans aren't. They know that
the Brazilians made it to the semifinals in Atlanta, then lost in
the bronze-medal match. They remember how Brazil finished third in
last summer's World Cup, how it gave the US all it could handle in
the semifinal. And, most importantly, the Americans realize that
with continued improvement and more national support, Brazil could
become one of the world's truly elite teams.
</P>
<P>
   The hierarchy of world soccer could be very different by the
time the 2003 World Cup rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is interesting, because they've always been a country
that's been in the background until recent years,'' veteran US
midfielder Julie Foudy said Monday. ``And they've really emerged
since the last Olympics. They're getting better, and when they get
really organized _ and they're starting to; (the country is)
putting more money into the women's side _ we're going be screwed,
because they're going to be so good.''
</P>
<P>
   They're good now. Very good. They've already got the players, so
all they need is more international experience. The 25 players on
Brazil's preliminary Gold Cup roster had a combined 250 caps. US
midfielder Kristine Lilly has 205.
</P>
<P>
   Before this tournament, Brazil had played only four
international matches since the World Cup, none since a 4-2 loss in
October to the host team in the US Cup. The Americans played 18
matches during that time.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is short on experience, not talent. Katia has 23 goals in
only 16 international matches. She scored seven Sunday against
Trinidad and Tobago. Her front-line mate Pretinha has 24 goals in
23 matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer a time when you can step on the field against
Brazil and know you're going to get a win,'' US forward Tiffeny
Milbrett said Monday. ``And you know that against Brazil it's going
to be a top-level, world-class game.''
</P>
<P>
   Foudy called the Brazilian forwards ``lethal'' players who could
``score at will.'' And they should be doing so for a long time,
considering that Katia is only 23 years old and Pretinha 25. The
team's star player, midfielder Sissi, is 33 but has only 40 caps.
Six of Brazil's players had no caps coming into the Gold Cup, and
19 players are 25 or younger.
</P>
<P>
   China's already proven to be a strong adversary for the US, and
Brazil is poised to join them. Soon.
</P>
<P>
   The US knows it, which is why head coach April Heinrichs has
been preparing for the future. She's playing her younger players
like Nikki Serlenga (hat trick vs. Costa Rica), Christie Welch, and
Susan Bush, affording them valuable experience.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Foudy, Milbrett, Mia Hamm, Joy Fawcett, and the rest of
the World Cup veterans can still carry the US, but they've played a
lot in their careers. They can't do it forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been real conscious about the old ladies and the
veterans,'' Foudy said Monday. ``And having a good mix of the old
ladies and the young guns. And always you have to have that
combination . . . One of the things April did when she came in this
year after the World Cup was keep the core of the veterans but also
really experiment with some new younger players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was decided that these were the players (we) were going to
invest in for the future. Especially when some of us retire, these
are some of the players that are going to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   And keep teams like Brazil in the Americans' rearview mirror.

 SPINA SPENT 31 YEARS GETTING TO THE TOP OF STATE STREET BANK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 888-346-9867 or (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ David Spina was 33 years old, a smart young banker with
a used VW Beetle, a Harvard MBA, and an urge to leave Vietnam
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1976. He'd been working at State Street Bank for seven
years _ first as a credit analyst and then, after getting his MBA,
as a commercial loan officer _ when he got the call. The chief
executive, William Edgerly, had told his lieutenants to scour the
bank's ranks for the smartest up-and-comers they could find; he was
looking for an assistant, a right-hand man. Edgerly liked what he
saw in Spina _ bright, hard-working, a potential leader with his
military training _ and offered him the job.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't at all what Spina had planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been totally focused on my banking career,'' says the man
who is now CEO himself. ``I did not know Bill personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Spina, colleagues and family members prodded him to
take the job. He's been showing up for work at 225 Franklin St.
ever since, beating a patient path to the top of a company that has
become one of the world's financial giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the way to the office,'' he jokes. After 31 years at
the asset servicing and investment firm, in roles from financial
chief to president, there is perhaps no one more suited than Spina
to lead State Street into the next decade. Yet few envy the
challenge he faces.
</P>
<P>
   Spina takes the baton from Marshall Carter, a man who is
something of a legend everywhere from Wall Street to Boston's city
streets. Part war hero, part philanthropist, Carter, who stepped
down May 18, made success look easy, overseeing eight years of
double-digit earnings growth and a sevenfold jump in State Street's
market value, to $17.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a sense of comfort and status quo in Spina's
appointment to the number one post, there is also hushed
uncertainty. For one, Carter is a tough act to follow. Can Spina _
or anyone, for that matter _ keep State Street on this steady
growth track for yet another seven to nine years?
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the leadership factor. Does Spina, a loyal
number two for so long, have what it takes to step into the top
job? Soon after being spotted by Edgerly, Spina became chief
financial officer; more duties were gradually added to his
portfolio through the years. But always he was Mr. Inside, running
the operations for someone else rather than leading his own
department. With his new posting, Spina is moving out of the very
long shadows cast by the two men who preceded him and into the
spotlight on a very large stage.
</P>
<P>
   State Street handles recordkeeping and accounting on $6.2
trillion of assets for mutual funds and large institutional
investors. It is the nation's second-biggest pension manager, with
$720 billion under its watch.
</P>
<P>
   To a person, analysts say Carter will be missed. But investors
are optimistic about Spina so far. Boston investment manager Lee
Forker asserted recently, ``There will be no diminution of the
momentum.'' He predicts, ``I think we will be pleasantly surprised
when we look back in a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who steps down as chairman at year end, is firmly behind
his pick. He says Spina, 57, has been in training for this job for
4 1/2 years. Carter, 60, put him in charge of growing the company's
European business two years ago. That meant being abroad one-third
of the time, an assignment Spina didn't mind, he says, as his
children were nearly grown. He is blessed with the ability to sleep
on planes. And he kept up his rigorous workout schedule by joining
a gym in London (he belongs to two Boston-area gyms as well).
</P>
<P>
   In October, Carter asked Spina to form a task force and develop
an Internet strategy. A skeptic at first, Spina vows he's now a
convert. Not surprisingly, Europe and Web projects top Spina's list
of priorities today.
</P>
<P>
   It was important for Spina to take on big projects, to raise his
profile, Carter says. ``We wanted people to stop thinking of him as
the CFO.''
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker who's made Boston his home, Spina studied
history as an undergraduate at the College of the Holy Cross in
Worcester and then joined the Navy. He captained a swift boat in
the war, a post he describes as ``98 percent boredom, 2 percent
terror.'' He served his last two years of duty at a desk job in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy to be in a military uniform stateside in 1968 and
1969, Spina says. ``It took me a long time to understand the amount
of social change that went on in the US while I was (in Vietnam)
growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was with a deep yearning to move beyond those lost war years
that Spina tackled his career. ``The strong urge was to get on with
my life,'' he says. A voice in his head kept asking, ``When was I
going to catch up?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Spina finished his MBA, got married, and moved into a
full-time loan officer's job at State Street, turning down other
offers in Manhattan. He took up skiing to survive New England
winters and is an avid tennis player, step-aerobics fanantic
(``front row,'' he says), and wine lover. He reads five newspapers
a day.
</P>
<P>
   A man with less patience and control over his ego could never
have thrived in Carter's shadow. Spina was considered a contender
for the corner office back in 1992, but Edgerly brought Carter in
from Chase Manhattan. Spina was disappointed, he admits, and
getting a new boss after 16 years was ``very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Carter did was remodel the offices and cut a
door in the wall between his office and Spina's. It was usually
closed but always unlocked, Spina says. The one time cleaning
people locked the door by mistake, Carter stormed around to the
entrance everyone else used. ``It added three seconds to his trip.
He wasn't happy,'' Spina jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Spina said, ``My first personal agenda was for Marsh to
trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did. While Spina is clearly glad to be able to stretch
his own wings at last, he says he's grateful to Carter for handing
him major responsibilities. He needed to spend time with customers
and executives in Europe and elsewhere, because, ``In many ways, I
was perceived as an inside person.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter was hired to take the company global. Spina must now work
to penetrate markets more deeply and keep State Street at the crux
of big investors' needs, from settling stock purchases and handling
currency trades to helping clients develop better tools for their
portfolio managers.
</P>
<P>
   With humility rarely seen in the financial district, Spina now
says Edgerly picked the right guy for the time. ``I'm a different
person today,'' he says, ``and a lot more ready today than I was in
1992.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgerly recalls that Spina took the news well at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``His character is to be zealous about opportunity,'' Edgerly
says. ``He is invigorated by challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Spina is liked and respected throughout the
company. If his manner is more formal than Carter's _ Spina is
bow-tied, polite, almost professorial when he speaks _ he has
managed to forge more allies than enemies in his long tenure at the
company.
</P>
<P>
   But Spina has wasted no time in reaching out to build a new
inner circle. On the day he was promoted, he announced the creation
of an office of the CEO, which includes Nicholas Lopardo, chief of
investment arm State Street Global Advisors, chief operating
officer Ronald Logue, and administrative chief John Towers.
</P>
<P>
   Spina also intends to carry on State Street's reputation as a
good corporate citizen. He is steeped in a culture established by
Edgerly in the early 1980s, when State Street first reached out
aggressively as a contributor to charities and a partner with local
government in providing subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Grogan, chief of government and public affairs at Harvard
University and a former staff member for mayors Kevin H. White and
Raymond Flynn, has worked with Spina over the years on many public
projects, including what's now the Metropolitan Boston Housing
Partnership. He believes Spina will keep State Street involved _
and perhaps write his own chapter in the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``David is not a grandstander,'' Grogan says. ``but very steady
and very committed to the things he cares about.'' Furthermore, he
adds, ``He is not an off-putting type. He is someone who could
really bring people together.''
</P>
<P>
   If Spina can bring that trait to his new job, he'll be off to a
running start. Even as he spins the globe for growth, he says, he
won't forget the people who work quietly here at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a pretty good sense of the whole,'' he says. ``It takes
a lot of people to make a company like this work.''

   MYSTERIES OF THE MANGO: It's hard to believe that mangoes are
more well-known in most of the world than apples; the mango is the
world's No. 1 fruit eaten out of hand. And every country that eats
mangoes has its own twist on using them in dishes. (Includes
4-column color photo of mangoes being fried with shrimp, 3-column

   WITH: DINING: It must have happened while my back was turned. A
decent dinner _ we're talking dining, not just eating _ used to be
available for $50 or $55. Now, in the better restaurants, I never
see a bill that is less than $80 for two.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CYBERSPICE: Once, their names were known only to
restaurateurs, food critics and an esoteric circle of gourmets and
foodies. Now, scores of celebrity chefs have come out of the

that's going to astonish folks who aren't familiar with what parent
company Honda has been doing of late with its engines, which
benefit from trickle-down technology from Formula One Grand Prix
racing. The Type S is classified as a near-luxury car, but there's
nothing ``near'' about its sportiness. (Includes a 4-column color

of DVD. (Includes 3-column B&AMP;W photo of Groucho Marx, two 6-pica
color photos of book jackets.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: ``66 Laps'': This thin _ in several senses _ first
novel concerns itself with the perennial subject of adultery. Not
so much the act itself, but the idea of the act and what that idea
can lead to. (Includes 6-pica color photo of book jacket.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: SKUBE ON BOOKS: Some authors, like the late Joseph Heller,
live the self-torture of trying to repeat what cannot be repeated.
With his first book, Heller entered both a title and an idea into
the vernacular: ``Catch-22.'' Heller's satirical war novel,
published in 1961, crystallized a no-win situation with mordant
accuracy, even if critics were slow to recognize it. (Includes

sympathy and attention for themselves. (Includes a 4-column color

   WITH: COMMENTARY: It's hard to imagine how companies without the
sense to give mental health full parity in their insurance plans
are smart enough to stay in business.

<P>
   ``Beware of all enterprises that require new clothes,'' Henry
David Thoreau once advised. Not that the retail industry pays any
attention. Instead, it has seized on this statistic: There are
approximately 100 million cellular phone users in this country who
spend about 6 minutes a day on their phones and hours toting them
in pockets, purses, backpacks, or briefcases.
</P>
<P>
   So for fall, designers are combining the practical with the
gimmicky. For the first time, clothiers from Brooks Brothers to
Levi's to Fubu are designing clothes for the information age.
They're incorporating pockets perfectly sized for cell phones in
blazers, jeans, tuxedo jackets, and skirts. Some of the garments
feature hidden pouches while others flaunt the phone as an
accessory on a lapel, leg, or arm.
</P>
<P>
   The rush to accommodate all manner of portable electronics is
on. In the coming weeks, retailers will also be offering a rash of
pullovers and pants with built-in spaces for Palm Pilots, MP3 and
CD players, and beepers. And new clothing companies are setting up
shop to cater to a nation of gadget users.
</P>
<P>
   For example, last December, the www.ufunction.com website was
born to sell moderately priced womenswear with outer pockets to
hold cell phones and music players, making the electronics both
accessible and decorative.
</P>
<P>
   Another young clothier, B. Lucid, will be selling a jacket at
Nordstrom and Express as of next month that holds a beeper on the
sleeve, which lights up a strobe from wrist to shoulder when the
wearer is paged.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the only wires touching clothing were
those sewn into brassieres and the only directions needed were
about how to launder. That was before a Houston radiologist and a
NASA engineer applied their knowledge to create the New York
company's microstretch slicker, retailing for less than $80.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the pager is set on vibrate, the vibration sets off the
light. It's a patented electronic device,'' says Steven Zellman,
who runs the New York-based B. Lucid. ``Let's say you don't have a
pager. You hate pagers. But you want the jacket to go clubbing. You
can hit the switch inside the jacket and it will light up.'' The
jacket, powered with a 9-volt battery, can flash for about six days
nonstop and works with any pager, although the company has a
marketing agreement with Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   Even the conservative end of the business is plugging into the
trend.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Brothers is incorporating a lower cell-phone pocket
inside some suit jackets and blazers and all of its outerwear for
men this fall. Palm Pilots also slip easily into the inner jacket
pocket designed for wallets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really the trend, I think, of the whole industry,'' said
Brooks Brothers spokeswoman Geri Corrigan. ``With people dressing
more casually, you can't carry around a big briefcase when you're
wearing chinos and a button-down shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on consumer reaction, the cell-phone pocket may be
extended to some women's outerwear as well. But Corrigan said women
may be harder to convince because they're accustomed to carrying
small electronics in their purses and may not want their
silhouettes marred by a protruding Nokia.
</P>
<P>
   Where some see a marketing problem, others see an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ufunction is offering a crinkled nylon stretch
blouse (in white, lemon, and orange) with Velcro closures up the
front and an outer cell-phone pocket that runs down toward the
waist. The phone, on display at the rib cage, is meant to be the
focal point.
</P>
<P>
   The company also makes a black nylon stretch skirt with a phone
pocket strategically placed just below the thigh, a stylish black
sheath to be worn with a belt that has a cell-phone pouch as well
as jeans, cropped pants, fleece pullovers, and brushed cotton
trenchcoats with the same outer compartments.
</P>
<P>
   For MP3 and CD players, Ufunction has designed pockets in nylon
windbreakers and vests and plans on rolling out a men's line in
late autumn. A spokeswoman said the company is so new it won't have
hard sales data until the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Tommy Jeans is introducing its cotton laminate
Tection jacket that has a cell-phone pocket on its front lapel. The
fall line also includes a flight jacket, retailing for $179, with a
CD player pocket on the arm and loose-fitting jeans with phone
compartments above or below the knee, selling for between $69 and
$79, depending on the style.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Cole is including cell-phone pockets inside some men's
suits and outerwear pieces that are part of the urban-oriented
Reaction collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``An accessory pocket like that is an added novelty,'' said
Kenneth Cole Productions spokesman David Stewart. ``It's a
development because of need. You walk down the street in any large
city and people are on cell phones nonstop. It's just a convenience
that we recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. has begun working cell-phone slots into its
Red Tab, Silver Tab, and the youth-focused L2 brands, as well as
some styles of shorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the most basic pocket is large enough to hold a zip
disk,'' said L2 designer Thom Massat. ``That's our gold standard.
No pocket smaller than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dockers, the unofficial uniform of Kendall Square, will be
offering its so-called Hands Free khakis with cell and Palm Pilot
pockets in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would look fine empty. But you can tell looking at it that
it's designed for a gadget,'' said Dockers spokeswoman Amy
Gemellaro. The pants come in ``chalk,'' ``new khaki,'' and
``burl,'' part of the green family, and will retail for $52.
</P>
<P>
   For dressier _ and more expensive _ casual clothing, menswear
designer Wilke-Rodriguez put cell-phone pockets on the sleeve of
its cotton/rayon crewneck sweater and inside a charcoal stretch
flannel jacket with concealed snap closures. The pieces will be
available at Bloomingdale's in Chestnut Hill, Jasmine in Boston,
and Casablanca in Lenox.
</P>
<P>
   The concept has even trickled down to the rental tuxedo market.
</P>
<P>
   Fubu the Collection sports a pouch for a cell phone in its
formal wear jackets as a novelty selling point for prom-goers or
groomsmen. One can only hope the groom remembers to shut off the
phone during the vows.

MAKING MUCH OF A DISSING MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cartoony celebrity deathmatch of the month is between Eminem
and Christina Aguilera. She's the co-queen (with Britney Spears) of
the carefully choreographed teen music scene, he's the hate-filled
white rapper whose new album is becoming the soundtrack of summer
2000. She's all high-school tease and exposed bellybutton; he's
sloppy rage and a fully extended middle finger.
</P>
<P>
   The fight kicked up when Aguilera ragged on Eminem's domestic
violence song ``'97 Bonnie and Clyde'' on MTV. His revenge was to
rap about her all-purpose skankiness on his latest hit, ``The Real
Slim Shady,'' including the image of the Real Slim Blondy spreading
venereal disease. Now, in the cover story for the double issue of
Rolling Stone, Aguilera is suitably teed off about the insult, even
if it helped her win the magazine's cover story. ``I was offended
and really disgusted by it,'' she says, adding more
philosophically: ``I see where he's coming from, in the sense that
you take this guy who wants to be respected as a serious rap
artist, and all of a sudden he is in the world of MTV and `TRL.' I
can see where he would get a little mad and want to rebel against
the Britney Spears, 'N Sync, Backstreet Boys world of teen music.''
</P>
<P>
   And not only does the little dissing contest draw the battle
lines in today's best-selling music world, but it serves as a
reminder of the way Rolling Stone manages to embody the two sides
without appearing totally ridiculous. (Imagine the Monkees on the
cover of Rolling Stone 30 years ago, with Mick Jagger and Peter
Tork in a duel.) You can't go 10 pages in this issue without
tripping over a mention of Eminem and a mention of Aguilera, from
Random Notes and Tour Report to Recordings, and yet the whole
things hangs together in some kind of weird, fractured,
peroxide-drenched way.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Eminem and Aguilera aren't so different after all.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   If ``The Perfect Storm'' isn't a massive box office hit, it
won't be from imperfect George Clooney hype. The man with the
bobbing head has nailed more magazine covers than his defunct
``ER'' doctor performed intubations. And entertainment junkies
don't seem to tire of his always stubbly mug, even if the July
Men's Journal cover photo of Clooney floating on a piece of
wreckage is just a little bit tacky.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney is a curious celebrity, in that he seems to have it both
ways. He's passionately critical of the gossip press, but he is
charming and endlessly accessible with writers from the glossier
outlets. He's a guy's guy who attracts straight male fans,
evidenced by his Men's Journal front, but then he's a romantic
hero, too, which means Vogue felt comfortable putting him on its
recent cover.
</P>
<P>
   In the article, writer Doug Stanton visits Clooney at the home
he bought from Stevie Nicks _ ``think of a posh fishing lodge
mounted on a wooded hill and you're there'' _ and Clooney supplies
Stanton with basketball tips. Much is made of Clooney's attachment
to ``the Boys,'' eight friends who hang out together to heal their
marital wounds, as well as his concern with his own work ethic.
Indeed, the 39-year-old star says he will never marry again, that
instead of family he will leave a legacy of movies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the Readings section of the July issue of
Harper's Magazine there's a blue two-page spread with white
dropped-out type that looks like either an ad for Absolut vodka or
a short story by Mary McGarry Morris. Turns out it's a merger of
both brands: fiction as commerical tool, author as ad-copywriter,
literary reader as bait. Apparently the ad series, yet another
clever grabber from the agents of Absolut, has been around for a
few years, so I am behind in my observation of the blurring of
church and state boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Does it help that Morris's story is critical of our ad-driven
culture, ending with the image of a publically worshipped junk-yard
sign reading ``Absolut''? Or is one man's protective irony another
man's sales spin?

D.C. NEIGHBORHOOD ADJUSTS TO LIFE WITH ELIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER WALSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After spending 35 days in an upscale neighborhood
in northwest Washington, Elian Gonzalez may be going home, leaving
behind residents whose initial alarm over the attention their new
neighbor would bring turned into a feeling that his presence was in
some ways a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When 58 federal marshals move into the neighborhood, well,
we've felt pretty safe lately,'' said Chris Buckley, who lives
across the street from the Rosedale estate, which is owned by the
Youth for Understanding International Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley's children even made some extra cash from the reporters
and photographers staking out the scene when Elian first moved in
May 25 from the Eastern Shore of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sold lemonade for 25 cents and homemade cookies for 25
cents,'' said Buckley's 8-year-old son Conor, who made $7.50 that
day off the thirsty media. ``They said it was good and they also
said, `I want some more.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the Cleveland Park neighborhood said the biggest
problem has been limited access to the grounds around the estate,
which usually is a hot spot for dog walkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When word first went out `guess who's coming to dinner,' I'm
ashamed to say I thought, `What about the dogs,' '' Buckley said.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Valdalsum normally lets her dog, Holly, run free on the
fenced grounds that are open to the public. But heightened security
because of Elian has forced dog owners to keep their pets on a
leash and use only a roped-off part of the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't have the freedom to walk around,'' Vandalsum
said. ``She wants to go there and run.''
</P>
<P>
   But without the constant trampling of walkers, what once looked
like desert land is now lush green grass, Buckley said.
</P>
<P>
   The media, which has spent hours, even days, staking out the
complex trying to capture a story or photo of the young Cuban,
hasn't ruined the grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day he (Elian) was coming, the neighbors and the
media were just hanging out together,'' said Ruthanne Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen J. Boitano, a stringer for the Associated Press and
often the only member of the media at the estate, developed a good
relationship with area residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really 98 percent of the neighbors are friendly. One old lady
is crotchety and was snapping at us,'' Boitano said. ``They'll be
happy to get their park back.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents several times invited the Gonzalezes and their friends
to potluck dinners at their $750,000-plus homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very down-to-earth regular people that seemed to be
in limbo and caught up in this political drama that are just
wanting to go home,'' said Miller, who attended one of the dinners.
``The kids are more oblivious. The adults seemed to be carrying the
burden of this political drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Some political drama emerges from time to time outside of the
estate with protesters carrying signs or yelling through
megaphones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a few protesters but they've been very well
behaved,'' said Miller, who originally envisioned a chaotic scene
similar to the ones outside Elian's home in Miami's Little Havana.
``It was a small price to have to pay to provide a nice place for
this family that's in limbo.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all the residents agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait until this kid goes back because he's given us a
lot of problems,'' said Margaret Thompson, a 10-year resident. ``I
need to worry about my sewer. I need to worry about my water. I
don't need to worry about this little kid.''

FEW WAYS TO LESSEN TAX LIABILITY ON CAPITAL GAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Shortly after our son was born we began to make $600
quarterly contributions to a mutual fund account in his name. Since
we now expect he will begin college in four years, we feel it is
time to begin gradually moving money from Magellan to a more
conservative investment. We have transferred $15,000 to the CD. We
plan to make similar transfers each year until his senior year or
until we deplete the account. Our current concern is with respect
to taxes. For several years now Magellan has reported substantial
capital gains, creating an income tax liability. By selling some
shares to purchase the CD, he will be realizing additional capital
gains liabilities this year. When we file his tax return, we may
report that the shares sold were the ones most recently purchased.
This transaction would minimize the capital gain, although a
portion will be treated as a short-term gain and will be taxed at a
higher rate. Is there any way to minimize his tax obligation on the
capital gain? Is there any way to avoid paying taxes on the
interest on the CD?
</P>
<P>
   R.B., Sudbury, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The situation is probably even darker than you think. Unless
you specified in writing to Fidelity which shares were being sold a
few months ago when you sold them to purchase the CD, you will have
to compute the capital gain using either the average cost per share
for all of the Magellan shares your son holds or the
first-in-first-out method. Since the latter would doubtless create
the highest tax liability, the average cost method will probably be
your best choice this year. J.K. Lasser's ``Your Income Tax'' is
emphatic on this point: You cannot wait until you file your
(income) tax return to allot specific sales to gain a tax
advantage, it says.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if you did not make written specifications of the
shares sold and if you choose the average cost method, you will
have to stick with that method when you make subsequent sales.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing I can think of to improve the overall tax
position is a fairly meager tactic at this point, which is to
transfer $500 a year from the taxable Magellan account to an
Education IRA in the same fund. You will still have to pay capital
gains taxes on those sales, but if the money is withdrawn for
educational expenses, the withdrawals, including any investment
returns that have been produced, will be tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   The only consolation prize I can give you is to say I think you
are making the right move, slowly transferring the money to
conservative assets as college time draws closer. In fact, I think
I would favor a more aggressive course, moving about $20,000 a year
into the CD accounts, thus having all of the money invested in
short-term instruments by the time your son starts college and
begins the process of paying the bills. From an investment point of
view, the cost of a college education is a short-term liability,
and thus it should be funded with short-term assets.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently sold some real estate and have $500,000 available
for investment. I have purchased a new home, mortgage-free, and
have no outstanding debts. My goal is to establish a conservative
investment plan for growth and income, with the income starting
after two years, for I don't know how much longer I will be
actively employed. I have contacted some financial advisers and
have been recommended a number of plans _ some good, some
confusing, some contradictory. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   G.C., Southborough, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In all candor, I think the reason you're having trouble
sorting through the various suggestions that have been made to you
is that you are probably looking for more than you can reasonably
expect. If your entire $500,000 were invested for income through a
five-year CD, after two years you would have $583,630, using the
highest national rate of 7.74 percent entering this week. At that
point, it would produce an annual income stream of $45,172. That
seems to fill the bill with a few thousand to spare. But it would
leave you little protection against inflation during your
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate how serious the threat of inflation is, consider
that 10 years from now you will need $59,245 to buy what $42,000
now buys, so the entire amount of your anticipated Social Security
benefit will simply go to offset the effect of inflation during
that first decade. And after that. . .
</P>
<P>
   Here's my suggestion: Divide the money into two equal pools,
with $250,000 going into the five-year CD and the remaining
invested in a good balanced fund, such as Fidelity Puritan or
Vanguard Balanced Index. After the two years you anticipate
working, the CD account would have grown to $291,680. At that
point, you could withdraw the actual yield, which would be $22,576
a year. In all likelihood, that figure would be inadequate for your
needs, so you would have to supplement that income with earnings
from a part-time job or some other kind of employment.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other $250,000, if your balanced fund produced
average annual returns of 9 percent and you reinvested all
distributions, you would accumulate $612,762 in that account by the
time you are 65. At that stage, you could divert $250,000 of those
funds from the balanced fund into your CD account, which would mean
that between the CD yield and Social Security you would have
sufficient funds to maintain your current standard of living. And
you would also have $362,762 remaining in the balanced fund, a pool
that should, in the long run, protect you against the ravages of
subsequent inflation.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, if you could save a bit of your earnings during
the next couple of years _ say, enough to fully fund IRA accounts _
that certainly wouldn't hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am recently retired and my wife expects to retire later
this year. My 401(k) money is still with my employer, but I plan to
put it in the same fund as the IRAs are in. In addition, I have a
military pension and my wife and I both plan to draw Social
Security at the earliest date. What do you recommend I invest in to
produce $1,500 a month without touching the principal?
</P>
<P>
   D.B., Escondido, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are two ways you can go with this, in my opinion. One
is precisely what you suggest _ adding the 401(k) money to the
Vanguard LifeStrategy Conservative Growth position and simply
establishing a program for monthly withdrawals of $1,500. Regular
readers of this column, I hope, are aware that I am skeptical about
withdrawing money from stock funds, effectively anticipating
capital gains and setting up a schedule for spending them whether
or not they have been realized. But since LifeStrategy Conservative
Growth is a balanced fund, with only 35.6 percent of its portfolio
in stocks, that schedule would entail withdrawals that represent
less than the yield, which is currently 4.24 percent, according to
Morningstar Mutual Funds.
</P>
<P>
   However, such a plan would not guarantee that you would not be
touching your principal. For example, so far this year the fund has
produced only a 1.7 percent total return. Had you invested $504,000
in the fund at the start of this year and withdrawn $1,500 a month,
you would have seen an erosion of nearly $5,000 of your capital by
now.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the second idea. As discussed in the letter above,
long-term CD rates are currently quite attractive, and an
investment of $235,000 in a five-year jumbo CD would supply you
with the desired income stream, leaving you with $89,000 to add to
your Vanguard accounts that are designed to protect you against the
inflation of the later years of your retirement. If you took that
course, in order to offset the fact that you can expect no growth
from the CD accounts, I would be slightly more aggressive, putting
the $89,000 in Vanguard LifeStrategy Moderate Growth fund, which is
similar to the fund you already hold, but allocating 54 percent of
its assets on the stock side.
</P>
<P>
   I have been writing about CDs a good deal in recent months, and
my mailbag is stuffed with letters from people inquiring where they
can find the rates I quote in my columns _ usually complaining the
rates offered locally are much lower. CD rates have ticked down a
bit in recent weeks but are still attractive. You can find a list
of institutions with the nation's best CD rates on the Data Bank
page of the Sunday New York Times or by going online to one of the
many Web sites that track interest rates
(www.bankrate.com/brm/rate/dep(long dash)home.asp is the one I
use).

LINCOLN'S GETAWAY TOPS RESTORATION LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER WALSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Lincoln's summer getaway, just 3 miles
and a short horse ride from the White House, was an escape not just
from the heat of the city but also from the day-to-day stresses of
office.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson Cottage, in northwest Washington, is where Lincoln
wrote his second draft of the Emancipation Proclamation. The
cottage desperately needs interior renovation, which is why the
structure tops this year's list of most endangered historic places.
The annual list, put together by the National Trust for Historic
Preservation, identifies historical sites in danger of demolition
or deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a call to all Americans that some of our most precious
treasures are at risk,'' Richard Moe, president of the trust, says.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1862 and 1864, while battles loomed in the distance,
Lincoln's son Tad climbed the trees outside Anderson Cottage and
was scolded in the family dining room when his pet goat ate flowers
from the garden. Lincoln's wife, Mary, stayed in the second-floor
dressing room during her recovery from a head injury she suffered
in a carriage accident. Some historians believe the mishap was a
sabotage attempt intended for the president.
</P>
<P>
   These days the dining room houses a copy machine and the
dressing room's hardwood floor is covered with Army-green carpet,
while the light-blue paint is peeling and the ceiling shows water
damage. The spot where Lincoln worked on his famous document is
practically bare, with the view from an old window once overlooking
the Capitol blocked by a new building.
</P>
<P>
   The only clues that the president spent about a quarter of his
term here are the few portraits and mementos displayed by workers
using the cottage, which sits on the grounds of the US Soldiers'
and Airmen's Home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is too important of a place to be largely unknown,'' Moe
said. ``This is one of the city's greatest hidden treasures.''
</P>
<P>
   The trust hopes to turn the building into an education center,
restoring its interior and furnishing it from the era. Although the
cost to restore the building was not disclosed, officials estimate
it would require several million dollars in public and private
funding.
</P>
<P>
   Funds were also scarce during the Civil War, which was why
Lincoln furnished the house seasonally, moving the family's
belongings to the cottage in May and taking them back to the White
House in November. The cottage, in essence, served as Lincoln's
Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a huge procession of carriages that would carry the
president's goods, and in the fall it would go in the other
direction,'' said Nick Minecci, a spokesman for the Armed Forces
Retirement Home whose office is in the cottage.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen strides from the back door is a copper beech
tree where Lincoln would spend time playing with his son, reading,
or writing correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last living link to President Lincoln,'' Minecci
said. ``If trees could talk, I'd like to hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   The tree branches form a trailing canopy surrounding the trunk,
creating a nook that is seven degrees cooler than the rest of the
lawn, Minecci said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president would bring his desk and chair,'' he said. ``If
this place was where he came to get away from it all, the copper
beech tree was the getaway from the getaway.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on this year's list are the Dwight D. Eisenhower Veterans
Affair Medical Center in Leavenworth, Kan.; historic neighborhood
schools around the country; the Hudson River Valley in New York;
5th and Forbes Historic Retail area in Pittsburgh; Nantucket;
Okeechobee battlefield in Florida; Red Mountain Mining District in
Colorado; Santa Anita Racetrack in California; Valley Forge
National Historical Park in Pennsylvania; and Wheelock Academy in
Oklahoma.

IT ALL COMES DOWN TO A COIN FLIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Heads I win, tails you lose. Only in soccer
do 22 people play for 90 minutes and have something important
decided by a toss of a coin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's weird, huh?'' US midfielder Julie Foudy said Tuesday
night after her team had won its Gold Cup group by drawing, 0-0,
with Brazil at Foxboro Stadium and then winning the tie-breaking
coin flip. ``The team was high-fiving me like I won. I said, `I
didn't do a thing.' I just stood there.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in soccer. No overtime. No penalty-kick shootout. Just the
simplest game of chance. The Americans prevailed _ and probably
ducked a date with nemesis China in Saturday's semifinals in
Louisville, Ky. _ because Sissi, Brazil's designated numismatist,
called tails.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have called tails, too,'' said Foudy.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever thought it would come down to random chance, not in
a group that was so one-sided that the Americans and Brazilians had
been able to name their margins in their previous two matches. The
US hammered Trinidad &AMP; Tobago, 11-0, and Costa Rica, 8-0. So,
incredibly, did Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing, that two teams both did 19-0,'' said US coach April
Heinrichs.
</P>
<P>
   Under tournament rules, it meant that if the two teams played to
a tie in the group finale, they would go to a coin flip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew about the goal differential,'' said Heinrichs. ``We
knew exactly what the criteria were. We understood that. I told the
team, `There's no overtime. Get the business done here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Americans didn't try. They outshot the Brazilians,
18-8. They had a 13-3 edge in corner kicks. And when Foudy was
low-bridged in the penalty area by Formiga in the closing moments,
they had a golden chance to win the game. But Kristine Lilly
decided in mid-stride to go right instead of left with her kick,
keeper Andreia smothered the ball, and it was spare-change time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never saw a coin flip,'' said Heinrichs, who played half a
dozen years with the national team. ``We've heard of it. Everyone
always talked about what a disaster it was to have a game decided
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletes always want to decide their own fate, and most sports
allow for it. Extra innings. Double, triple, quadruple overtime.
Playoff holes. Swimoffs. Pistols, blindfolded, at 30 paces.
Anything but Lady Luck.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer players would rather play until they seize up like the
Tin Man than go the spare-change route.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather play overtime,'' said Foudy. ``We had 'em, too. I
was like, `Man, just give us another 15 minutes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even penalty kicks (which is how the 1999 women's and 1994 men's
World Cups were decided) are preferable. At least someone gets to
put a foot to a ball in some format. Or a thumb-wrestling contest.
A three-legged race? Pie-eating? Naming world capitals?
</P>
<P>
   But a coin in the air?
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it isn't the best way to do it, but there's no
other way,'' said Brazilian coach Jose Duarte. ``So we have to
agree with it.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, nobody knew how to do it. After Canadian
referee Sonia Denoncourt blew the final whistle, the teams shook
hands and waved to their fans. Then they milled around, waiting for
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `What the heck are we doing?' '' Foudy said.
</P>
<P>
   The 16,000 customers weren't sure, either. Some tournament
matches do go to overtime. ``Some go right to penalty kicks,'' said
Heinrichs. Most draws end in draws, though, with the teams walking
off. But nobody was leaving. And nobody was moving.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, tournament official Jill Fracisco summoned Foudy and
Sissi to midfield and produced a coin. She pointed out one side,
then the other. And because the Brazilians were visitors, Sissi got
to choose. Fracisco tossed, caught, put one hand atop the other,
and showed the coin to both players.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody moved. Nobody pumped a fist. Nobody slumped a shoulder.
Was it a practice toss? Was it the real deal? Nobody knew. Finally,
Foudy turned to her teammates. ``We won,'' she informed them.
</P>
<P>
   Won what, other than the group? Not the game, which goes into
the books as 0-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you tie a team,'' Foudy mused, ``you walk away as if
you lost.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the Chinese don't beat Mexico in their group finale, the
Americans will end up playing them in the semis anyway.
</P>
<P>
   What they won was a game of chance, and they weren't quite sure
how to behave. So Foudy's teammates high-fived her because they
figured they had to do something.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you celebrate a coin toss?'' Foudy wondered.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Cafe Louis, an upscale eatery on Newbury Street, is
known for clams al forno and oven-poached cod. Specializing in
Northern Italian cuisine, the menu conjures images of hefty Italian
cooks. But the chef de cuisine is Mexican. And with the exception
of the sous chef, the rest of the cooks hail from Latin America:
two Peruvians, a Mexican, six Salvadorans and a Colombian.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same at Giacomo's Ristorante in the North End. Their
three cooks are Latino. Patrons peer through the open-air kitchen
and often ask the waiters: Where are the Italians?
</P>
<P>
   ``They wonder because they see only Hispanic guys,'' said chef
Richard Talieri, who creates the daily specials menu but leaves the
cooking to his staff.
</P>
<P>
   At dining spots across Boston, and in big cities across the
country, Latinos have worked their way up from jobs as dishwashers
and busboys to more prestigious work. Now, in Boston, New York, Los
Angeles and Chicago, Latin American immigrants can easily account
for more than half of the cooking staff at any given restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a comparative basis they're better cooks,'' said Anthony
Bourdain, chef of Les Halles, a Park Avenue brasserie. ``The best
French cooks, the best Italian cooks in New York are Mexican and
Ecuadoran.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the majority of line cooks at many restaurants are
Latino, the person at the head of the line _ the chef de cuisine _
is usually Caucasian. It has become, say many in the business, an
unspoken rule: Put an Italian, French person or American in charge
of the kitchen, someone who can charm diners. Keep the Latinos, and
other immigrants, in the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some Americans who don't like seeing me in charge,''
said Simon Restrepo, a Colombian immigrant who is the evening sous
chef at Biba. ``They are jealous because they went to culinary
school and I didn't. They have a lot of pride and can't accept
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Diners expect the affable Italian speaking with a lilting
accent, or the ebullient American, or the French chef who speaks
with a raised eyebrow. Those stereotypes clash against the reality
of the quiet, meticulous Brazilian searing steak and reducing
sauces _ unseen by the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Restaurantgoers don't see them,'' said Jaime Mammano, the chef
at Mistral, whose cooking staff of 25 includes 15 Latinos. Mammano
calls them ``fantastic cooks.'' They learn quickly, and they don't
have attitudes, like Americans who graduate from culinary arts
schools, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids coming out of culinary schools are a little too big
for their britches,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs say that once Latinos proved they could outshine culinary
school-trained cooks, the chefs began promoting them.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Latino chefs, Restrepo, 29, began as a dishwasher and
worked his way up over 10 years. Susan Regis, co-chef at Biba,
calls Restrepo her ``amazing right-hand man.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many chefs, Regis said she prefers hiring Latino immigrants
over culinary arts-educated cooks. Many chefs say Latinos are
better cooks, and they all have their theories as to why.
</P>
<P>
   ``They grow up in the culture of cooking, and we grow up in the
culture of frozen TV dinners and fast food,'' Regis said. ``They
watched their moms coming home from the market with fresh-killed
chickens, with the head and feet still on . . . so imagine the kind
of heartfelt, tangible feeling that they can bring to food.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Davis, the chef at Henrietta's Table in Harvard Square,
attributes it to how Latinos _ and Asians _ are brought up. ``Their
food comes from the garden, or farm, whereas growing up in America,
food comes off supermarket shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Kingsford, chef de cuisine at Al Forno, said the
Guatemalans who work for him know how to balance flavors better _
an art that can make or break a dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine times out of ten, the Guatemalan cook is right on the
money, whereas the American will ask me, `How's this?' And it's
like, `Man, this needs salt.' '' Kingsford said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Johnson, chef of The Blue Room in Kendall Square, agrees,
saying Latinos have ``sharper palates'' because they were raised on
home cooking, unlike Americans raised on a lot of processed foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference in a lot of restaurant cooking is often adding
the right amount of seasoning,'' he said. ``You know how in
cookbooks it says `salt to taste'? That's where a lot of people
screw up. The same is true in restaurant cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from tastebud aptitude, there's an attitude difference,
many said. Americans who attend cooking school tend to get
frustrated more easily, and are overwhelmed by the pace of
kitchens. They quit more often, and get bored preparing the same
dish over and over _ a necessary part of the job.
</P>
<P>
   They require a lot of ``psychological maintenance'' for their
fragile egos, said Bourdain, of Les Halles.
</P>
<P>
   But many Latin American immigrants, who tend to come up through
the dishwashing ranks and who have held grueling jobs back home,
see cooking as an easy job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather work with a Mexican who worked his way up from
dishwasher than the kids graduating from culinary arts schools
today,'' Bourdain said.

WEB RETAILERS STILL WAITING FOR THE REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it too soon to say the retail side of electronic commerce was
wildly oversold in the first place and is now turning out to be a
major disappointment?
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just that the e-tailing world is starting to resemble
an episode of the hit show ``Survivor.'' Each week another company
bites the dust.
</P>
<P>
   It is that many of the assumptions that seemed to underly the
whole industry are crumbling, along with the stock prices. Chief
among them: that e-tailers enjoy a critical cost advantage over
traditional retailers.
</P>
<P>
   You remember the argument: How could anyone compete with the big
e-tailers, who didn't need to build stores and didn't need to pay a
huge work force to staff those stores?
</P>
<P>
   So how do you reconcile that with the latest news, reported in
Sunday's New York Times, that most e-tailers are raising their
prices and shipping costs in a bid to become profitable?
</P>
<P>
   Or a hypercritical report on Amazon.com, issued by Lehman
Brothers last week, which says Amazon can't find a way to make a
profit on the items it sells, and that as a result the company
suffers from a ``weak balance sheet, poor working capital
management and massive negative operating cash flow?''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Haverty has an answer. ``People forgot that what the
Internet does is deliver bits,'' said Haverty, a senior vice
president at State Street Research. ``You need people to deliver
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   And it turns out that delivering stuff is not easy _ or cheap.
The Internet may be new economy, but getting someone in a van to
schlep something to your house is decidedly old economy. It can
also be expensive, especially at a time of rising wages and
gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the retail side, the Internet is not something that is
going to revolutionize everything that came before it,'' said Rick
Wise, an e-commerce specialist at Mercer Management Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Compare e-commerce to an innovation in retailing that truly was
revolutionary: the rise of the superstore.
</P>
<P>
   When Tom Stemberg, the founder of Staples, launched his chain in
1986, the typical local stationery store sold a dozen yellow legal
pads for $10 or $11. The first Staples sold the same pads for
$3.99.
</P>
<P>
   With a price advantage like that, was it any wonder that Staples
and its fellow superstores became huge hits, or that they quickly
vanquished their mom-and-pop competitors?
</P>
<P>
   When e-tailers have boasted big price advantages, those
advantages have been illusory. Thanks to a big infusion of money
from venture capital and initial public offerings, the e-stores
were able, for a time, to charge artificially low prices and
subsidize their shipping costs.
</P>
<P>
   Those days are gone. With the new push for profitability and the
drying up of Wall Street money, prices must now reflect economic
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``When companies are forced to charge appropriate prices, we
will find out which Internet categories are truly mass markets and
which ones are luxury markets,'' said Nick Moore, a money manager
with Jurika &AMP; Voyles in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Groceries may fall into the latter category. So far, none of the
Internet grocery companies has figured out how to make a buck. Two
of the major players, Webvan and HomeGrocer,com, this week
announced a merger. Webvan lost $57 million in its most recent
quarter; HomeGrocer lost $43 million.
</P>
<P>
   If the two boost prices to cover their costs, will there still
be enough customers left to make this a big company? Analysts
aren't sure. They also have their doubts whether other categories _
pet food and electronic equipment _ will ever succeed on the Web.
The former is too cheap; the latter requires too much selling and
explaining. Books, records, and videotapes are a better fit, say
money managers, although it remains unclear whether they will ever
generate significant profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an equity investor, I find it hard to believe that
e-commerce companies are going to be very attractive,'' said
Haverty of State Street Research.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Wise, the Mercer consultant, is more optimistic. He expects
the next generation of e-tailers to add value by focusing on the
Web's true strengths: providing information and convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Put us down in the skeptics' camp. We don't doubt that e-tailing
is here to stay, or that it will take a chunk of the retail dollar,
over time. But we suspect it will never be the revolutionary
development it was supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   But we don't have a closed mind on the subject. If some wizard
like Harry Potter comes along one day and finds a way to send
books, records, pet food, and televisions over the Internet and
have them pop out, fully formed, in your house, then we may be
prepared to change our minds.

   Not long ago, Jeff Bezos sat on top of the e-commerce world. The
cheery founder of Amazon.com Inc. had delivered on his promise to
get big fast, pushing beyond his initial mission of selling books
online to offer CDs, toys, and even power tools. Investors made him
a billionaire, on paper at least, and Time magazine made him its
Person of the Year for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Then came April's punishing market correction.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, it seemed, Wall Street decided the dot-com business
model was overhyped and exceedingly risky, with too many companies
emphasizing rapid growth over profits.
</P>
<P>
   As impatient investors abandoned e-commerce stocks and venture
capital money dried up, the list of former Internet retailers began
to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Boo.com, a British clothing e-tailer, went out with a splash
just six months after its flashy debut.
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart.com slammed its online doors shut after being jilted by
a major investor, Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Still others, like the gift site Violent.com, quietly faded away
from the online marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even the mighty seem vulnerable. Last week, Amazon.com, the
king of electronic commerce, was forced to defend itself against a
highly critical analyst's report that questioned whether the
e-tailer could survive in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, a Lehman Brothers analyst, Ravi Suria, drew harsh
conclusions after comparing money-losing Amazon.com to
bricks-and-mortar retailers, which have long been judged on their
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com's weak balance sheet and inability to turn a profit
on each item sold were ``financial characteristics that have driven
innumerable retailers to disaster throughout history,'' Suria
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Suria said Amazon.com's mounting debt and negative cash flow
posed a large risk for investors buying its convertible bonds _
debt that can be turned into common stock. And he warned that the
company will be under more pressure this Christmas selling season,
with cash-flush traditional retailers like Wal-Mart Stores and
Kmart Corp. spending big bucks to improve their online stores.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com spokeswoman Patty Smith called the Lehman Brothers
report ``ridiculous'' and said the Seattle-based Amazon.com had $1
billion in cash at the end of March, more than enough to finance
its business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to generate positive cash flow from operations over
the rest of the year,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Amazon.com's dominance in the online marketplace
had helped the company escape much of the dot-com backlash that saw
other Internet stores laying off employees, slashing advertising
costs, eliminating freebies and closing their doors.
</P>
<P>
   But now, it's clear that profits really do matter _ and even the
Web's biggest store is being punished for failing to comply with
Old Economy rules. Since December, Amazon.com's stock price has
plunged 68 percent, including a 19 percent drop last Friday
following the release of the Lehman Brothers report.
</P>
<P>
   Lackluster comments from other analysts, including influential
Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget, haven't helped Amazon.com.
While maintaining a strong buy rating on Amazon.com, Blodget has
predicted smaller gains in the company's second-quarter sales due
to slowdowns in the nation's economy and online retailing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone believes that Amazon.com's situation is so dire.
Many analysts point to the company's successes in attracting tens
of millions of customers by expanding into new markets such as
music, furniture, household appliances and hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Amazon.com boasts one of the highest buyer conversion
rates in the industry. About 10 percent of Amazon.com browsers
turned into buyers last month, while the industry average is less
than 5 percent, according to PC Data, a technology research firm in
Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   And in spite of its recent struggles, Amazon.com's market value
of $11.9 billion is 12 times the size that of rival
Barnesandnoble.com. Even Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co., a traditional
retailing pioneer with a market capitalization of $11.6 billion,
lags slightly behind Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the sky is falling,'' said Scott Van Winkle, an
analyst with the investment firm Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill in Boston.
``We thought (Amazon.com's stock) was overvalued at $50 to $100.
But I like the company. I like the business model.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Amazon.com began recovering this week, rising $2.5625
on Nasdaq Tuesday to close at $36.50.
</P>
<P>
   Some dot-com executives complain that Wall Street has added to
the turmoil by providing its share of misdirection. Last year, a
joke made the rounds that the best way to lose analysts' interest
was to mention a path to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, an analyst angered Edward Albertian, chief executive
of online grocer Streamline.com, by telling him to focus on
``selling his space'' rather than planning a path to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was in left field,'' said Albertian, who
previously worked for Staples Inc. and Star Markets Co. ``It's
always about profits.''
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that few Internet players _ with the possible
exception of barnesandnoble.com _ will take any pleasure in
Amazon.com's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Already, America Online, Yahoo and other portals that rely
heavily on advertising revenue have been hard hit by online
retailers' penny-pinching. And this week, share prices of big
technology consultants like Scient Corp. and Viant Corp. fell on
concerns that a Web shakeout will hurt their revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Small online retailers say Amazon.com's troubles are bad news
for anyone who's trying to lay the foundation for a successful Web
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all trying to build a category together,'' said Michael
Lannon, chief executive of Send.com, a Waltham-based online
retailer of gifts. ``If Amazon.com succeeds _ or anyone that I
compete against succeeds _ that's one more piece of evidence that
the whole market is viable.''

<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ Julia Alvarez has just sat through a culinary
celebration of the Dominican Republic roots she explores in her
novels ``How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents,'' ``Yo!'' and
``In the Time of the Butterflies.'' So after a meal of bean soup,
rice casserole, and bread pudding, what does Alvarez decide to read
to an audience of 40 fans?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not an excerpt from her historical work of fiction,
``In the Name of Salome,'' published this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like reading from a novel,'' says Alvarez, her large
eyes, the color of a rich cup of coffee, brimming with
mischievousness. ``I've always done it because people have told me
that I have to do it. I turned 50 this year and I figured I'm not
going to do anything I don't want to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right?'' she asks, her moment of defiance crumbling into the
politeness expected of traditional Dominican women.
</P>
<P>
   Right, murmurs the audience at the New England Culinary
Institute, encouraging Alvarez to be like the independent,
strong-willed Latinas they read about in her novels. And so the
diners get to hear something more relevant: a piece about the
eating habits of her characters in ``In the Name of Salome.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez has carved out a successful career doing the unexpected.
She spent her early years as a migrant professor/writer, jumping
from one adjunct teaching job to another. Three years ago, after
producing three novels, one book of essays, and four works of
poetry, she gave up a tenured teaching position at Vermont's
Middlebury College to devote herself to writing full-time.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez also defies expectations with ``In the Name of Salome.''
The novel follows the lives of Salome Urena, a poor, Dominican
woman of color who overcomes her circumstances to become the
country's national poet and her daughter, Camila, who at the ripe
age of 65 left a Vassar College teaching job to preach the
revolution in Fidel Castro's Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find any reveries here about assimilation and accents
that Americans have come to expect from Hispanic writers, says Ilan
Stavans, a Spanish professor at Amherst College who has edited many
anthologies of Latino literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julia is one that doesn't give the audience what the audience
wants,'' he says, ``but I think in some ways, teaches the audience
to want something different.''
</P>
<P>
   If you ask Alvarez, she'll simply say she's writing the books
she's compelled to write. The subjects reflect the bicultural
heritage of a woman who immigrated from the DR with her family when
she was 10 years old. But the stories have an added complexity.
They're tales of Dominican life told by a writer raised in the
United States who's part of an American literary tradition
(although when Alvarez says ``America'' she's referring to the
entire hemisphere, not just the US).
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think of myself as a hybrid,'' explains Alvarez,
``and there's still that pressure: You're American. You're
Dominican. What is it to be a Dominican? What is it to be an
American? What you should you do if you're either one?
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think the world is becoming more multicultural,''
Alvarez continues. ``It's going to be impossible to keep these
kinds of borders into the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, Alvarez didn't really know much about Salome Urena.
It was the name of a street in her hometown of Santo Domingo. Words
emblazoned on a school Alvarez often passed by. Writing the novel
helped Alvarez learn more about the birth of the nation she came
from.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go back and read the literature,'' says Alvarez.
``Understand what was happening in the other half of the
hemisphere. Try to understand what it is that happened that created
such a different America.''
</P>
<P>
   In the process, she discovered some lingering phobias. In
``Salome,'' Alvarez hints that Camila may have been a lesbian, a
lifestyle choice that people hid then and one that remains somewhat
controversial now in Latin communities. (``Ay Dios mio,'' Alvarez's
mother responded when Alvarez revealed Camila's sexual preference,
``you're going to get into touble with that.'')
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez was also disturbed by the specter of racism in the
country. Salome, a mulatto woman, was made ``whiter and whiter'' in
her official portraits, she says. ``I was just alarmed, alarmed.
This sense that out of respecto, she has to be lightened up.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez makes these comments while driving from her Weymouth,
Vt., home to Burlington, where the culinary institute event took
place. She manages to make significant eye contact, touch a leg,
and gesticulate often with her hands, while smoothly maneuvering
through traffic on Vermont's country roads.
</P>
<P>
   Warm and talkative, Alvarez has a voice that barely contains
traces of her Dominican roots. But she often speckles her speech
with Spanish words like analfabeto (illiterate) and companero
(companion).
</P>
<P>
   A gray top and loose black pants cover her petite, almost gaunt
figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of that was getting sick in Alta Gracia,'' Alvarez says
of her skinniness, referring to the organic coffee farm she and her
husband, Bill Eichner, own in the Dominican Republic. ``And being
on this damn book tour. It's just grinding, you know. Sometimes you
get to a place, then you have an interview, you go on to give the
reading, and you get back to the hotel at 11, and all you want to
do is crash.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The story of how Alvarez got to the point of promoting her books
on two-month tours is the stuff of legend. Her father, a physician,
had plotted to overthrow the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo.
When the coup failed, he fled to America with his wife and four
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez lost her homeland, her relatives, and her culture, but
the loss gave her the fuel she needed to become a writer. Now
Alvarez spends her days producing prose in the upstairs study of a
Vermont house she and Eichner built from wood found on his parents'
farm.
</P>
<P>
   She reclaims what was lost when she became an immigrant by
visiting the Dominican Republic four or five times a year and
working on projects like Alta Gracia. The name literally means
``high grace,'' but it's also what Dominicans call their patron
virgin, Altagracia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I wouldn't have felt so compelled if I were, say, living
in a community like Boston,'' says Alvarez of her work at Alta
Gracia. ``I live in Vermont. I mean, the Latino population here is
. . .,'' she scrunches her body into a ball, ``very small. It's the
calling and the yearning for what I left behind there.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to sell organic coffee. (Bags of the beans are
available at the Middlebury Food Co-op and womenshands.com for $10
to $12.) The money raised will fund a literacy and art center on
the farm, which hugs a mountain in the Dominican interior.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez, who still occassionally teaches at Middlebury, brought
12 college students to Alta Gracia for a course last winter. The
pupils worked the land, taught locals how to read, and wrote about
their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   In the dining room of her home, which is silent except for the
tweeting of birds, Alvarez thumbs through a thick binder of those
Alta Gracia memories: photographs, writing, and drawings the
students made to record the class. Her pride and excitement is
palpable as she turns each page.
</P>
<P>
   There's Carmen, the wife of Alta Gracia's caretaker, who
literally let down her hair under the influence of the Americans.
Another photograph shows the golden-ponytailed Lupe, who taught the
students cooking and gardening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lupe, my dear, is a man,'' Alvarez announces with a flourish.
``The kids were intrigued with her/him. She dresses like you would
not believe. She's a glamour girl.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove the point Alvarez starts turning the pages faster.
``I'm trying to see if I can find another picture of Lupe,'' she
says, before finally locating a photo of a reclining Lupe.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult for Alvarez to stop teaching. She had been an
educator since getting her masters in creative writing at Syracuse
University. Three years ago, she decided it was finally time to
focus completely on the writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really strongly love the classroom,'' says Alvarez. ``But,
you know, I used to tell my students this: `Only the empty hand is
free to hold.' You've got to let it go so it fills up with
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   She speaks from experience. In 1988, when Alvarez's
undergraduate alma mater Middlebury College offered her a tenure
track teaching job, she let go of her peripatetic writing life. At
the time, she worried about being a single woman in Vermont. She
wondered if she would find a companero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I was a woman in my late 30s, in a small town,'' Alvarez
says. ``I thought, `Well, this is it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A chance visit to the local ophthalmologist wiped away the
pessimism. The doctor was Eichner, who'd just returned from the
Dominican Republic after a stint volunteering at a charity hospital
run by Alvarez's cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez calls Eichner a ``doer,'' and the difference between the
two is obvious. It's Eichner who easily recites hard facts about
Alta Gracia: 200 acres that produced 2,000 pounds of coffee its
first harvest, he says. From Alvarez you hear romantic notions
about Alta Gracia's possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Eichner, who was raised on a Nebraska farm and grows vegetables
on the couple's 10 acres of land, is also responsible for the
subject Alvarez is chewing on at the culinary institute: her
introduction to the culinary world. As Alvarez explains it, she
didn't know her pots from her pans before marrying Eichner. Now
food is an integral part of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, of course,'' Alvarez reads to the audience, ``the changes
in my life trickle down into the lives of my characters. Now my
characters eat more than before. Or, let's put it this way, I think
a lot more about what they might eat, something I never used to
do.''

NEBRASKA LAW BANNING ABORTION PROCEDURE OVERTURNED BY HIGH COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Wednesday handed down its most
important abortion-related decision in years, overturning a
Nebraska law that had banned a procedure that abortion foes find
especially objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 ruling declared the law an unconstitutional ``undue
burden'' on a woman's right to choose. As important as the ruling
is, no one expects it to settle the nationwide debate over abortion
that has been fought for years in the arenas of politics, law and
ordinary conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nebraska is one of 30 states that have banned
``partial-birth abortion,'' a term that abortion opponents embrace
but that the medical profession does not recognize, the Nebraska
law went further than most statutes because it did not contain an
exception for the woman's health.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Wednesday, while not automatically invalidating the
laws in other states, made it unmistakably clear that they cannot
stand if they do not contain such an exception.
</P>
<P>
   The majority decision was written by Justice Stephen G. Breyer
and joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor,
David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia,
Clarence Thomas and Anthony M. Kennedy dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ruling was the first on an abortion-related issue
for Ginsburg and Breyer, who joined the tribunal after a 1992
decision in which the court upheld the right to choose abortion in
a 5-4 decision.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the 1997 Nebraska law had argued that it applied
only to a method known as dilation and extraction, used for some
abortions close to the 24-week point of viability outside the womb.
In this operation the fetus is removed intact after the doctor
collapses the skull by suctioning out its contents.
</P>
<P>
   But the court majority Wednesday was not persuaded by that
reasoning. It said the Nebraska law's language was so broad that it
might be used by abortion foes to outlaw another procedure, in
which a pre-viable fetus is dismembered as the doctor extracts it
from the uterus. The latter method is commonly used to end
pregnancies in the second trimester, during which the high court
has already held that a woman's right to choose outweighs the
state's interest in fetal life.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's ruling Wednesday upheld the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis, which struck down the
Nebraska law last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court had emphasized beforehand that it would not
reconsider the basic right of a woman to choose abortion, as set
down in the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision of 1973. And it was very
clear to anyone who had paid attention to the Nebraska case that
there were many paths the justices could choose.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even so, as the first abortion issue to go before the tribunal
since 1992, the Nebraska case, Stenberg vs. Carhart, No. 99-830,
had stirred great interest.
</P>
<P>
   When the case was argued before a packed courtroom on April 25,
only Scalia seemed sympathetic to the Nebraska law. ``The state is
worried about rendering society callous to infanticide,'' said
Scalia, the court's most outspoken abortion opponent. ``Why is that
not a valid state interest?''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor asked why the Nebraska law contained no exception on
use of the procedure for the woman's health. Donald B. Stenberg,
the Nebraska attorney general, contended an exception was
unnecessary since another procedure, dilation and evacuation, was
available.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Breyer said, some medical briefs maintained that the
other procedure was more risky for some women. Stenberg insisted
that the justices were obliged to defer to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The decision may be viewed on the Supreme Court's website,

THE TRIUMPHS AND STRUGGLES OF KARL MARX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
KARL MARX 
A Life 
By Francis Wheen 
Norton, 448 pp., $27.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Soviet Union has evaporated. Communism in China has taken on
a distinct capitalist sheen. And the last remaining countries still
firmly embracing communism, Cuba and North Korea, are economic
basket cases. Little more than 100 years after predicting
capitalism's demise in his magnum opus ``Das Kapital,'' Karl Marx
would seem to enjoy little appeal outside university walls or a
shrinking circle of ardent believers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Marx remains a seminal figure in intellectual history. So
now comes Francis Wheen, a columnist for The Guardian in London and
writer for the British humor magazine Private Eye, with a witty,
sometimes hilarious, sometimes pathetic portrait of the man. In
``Karl Marx: A Life,'' Wheen is largely sympathetic to Marx's
economic and political ideology, but what he does most effectively
is provide a compelling and detailed portrait of Marx's humanity,
his triumphs as well as his many struggles.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it is Marx's ideology rather than his life that have
echoed across time. Wheen excoriates political leaders for
perverting Marx's ideas to justify their oppressive regimes,
comparing them to those who interpret the Bible to buttress their
intolerance. Marx ``would have been appalled by the crimes
committed in his name,'' Wheen writes. ``The bastard creeds
espoused by Stalin, Mao, or Kim Il Sung treated his work rather as
modern Christians use the Old Testament: much of it simply ignored
or discarded, while a few resonant slogans (`opium of the people,'
`dictatorship of the proletariat') are wrenched out of context,
turned upside down, and then cited as apparently divine
justification.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wheen spends less time on Marx's philosophy than on his
turbulent personal life. The portrait is that of a brilliant
thinker who did a fairly miserable job of handling his private
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Marx was born in 1818 in the Rhineland. His father was a
religious and social liberal whose forebears included prominent
Dutch and German rabbis. Feeling trapped in his hometown, the young
Marx was happy to leave for college, and by the time he was 19, his
father had recognized the son's intellectual gifts and conceded
that Marx had ``outgrown him.'' When his father died, a year later,
Marx did not even bother to attend the funeral: He said he was too
busy.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing college, Marx left Prussia for France, where he
met his intellectual soulmate, Friedrich Engels. Marx was expelled
from France for his political views and moved to Brussels; he lived
there until he was forced to flee after the failure of various
European uprisings in 1848 _ the revolutionary year that also saw
Marx and Engels publish their ``Communist Manifesto.'' Marx
decamped to London, where he spent a great deal of time in pubs and
in the reading room of the British Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Marx lived the rest of his life in a perpetual state of poverty,
dodging creditors and depending on the generosity of Engels, who
raided the petty cash box of his father's firm to support his
friend and mentor. As Wheen acidly describes, Marx aspired to
maintain a bourgeois lifestyle; in spite of his family's financial
misfortune, the champion of the proletariat insisted on keeping a
personal secretary _ despite his incompetence _ because not having
one would tarnish his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Marx was a thin-skinned thinker who raged against critics,
usually in the form of book-length rebuttals filled with lacerating
opinions. As Wheen notes, Marx was a ``sadistic intellectual
thug.'' And he was regularly beset by physical ailments, especially
when deadlines loomed. ``At all events, I hope the bourgeoisie will
remember my carbuncles until their dying day,'' Marx said as he
rushed to put the finishing touches on ``Das Kapital.'' ``What
swine they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheen's otherwise excellent work is marred by a weak section
defending ``Das Kapital.'' Dismissing Marx's critics as either
having never read the tome or else having misunderstood it, Wheen
claims Marx's predictions about capitalism's implosion have been
largely borne out by time. That would come as a surprise to most of
the world, where American-style capitalism is not only alive but
dominant. And where exactly have communist societies thrived?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, this section takes up only a dozen or so pages of a
fine book that provides a fresh perspective on one of history's
towering figures.

<P>
   Seeing Tina Turner changes your life. My wife and I saw the
60-year-old soul rocker this month at the Fleet Center. Since then,
I cannot stand it when young people say they are tired.
</P>
<P>
   We had an 18-year-old stay with us recently for a week. He is a
typical teenager. He stays up late, he gets up late and then when
you stop by the house for an errand in the middle of the afternoon
and say ``How's it going?'' he says, ``I'm tired.''
</P>
<P>
   This reminds me of some of my college students. I really do not
want to sound like a 44-year-old crank, yapping about falling
standards (one standard has not fallen: Forty-four is still old to
young adults), but it seems as if all it takes to turn them into
Rip Van Winkle is a mere half-hour of research in the library. My
students have no idea how much entertainment they provide me on
Mondays when they come into class bedraggled, almost limping from
the titanic struggle of balancing studies with parties.
</P>
<P>
   My own kids crack me up, too. If you choose to believe this,
because this is entirely too convenient to believe, I have started
this column in an auto repair shop. My 9-year-old son is sitting
next to me. He was reading a book. About two minutes ago, he put
the book down and dropped his head down long enough for me to ask
him, ``Everything all right?''
</P>
<P>
   He stretched and responded with one word: ``Tired.'' Funny, I
thought I was the one who had just driven nearly three hours.
</P>
<P>
   This has been enough to drive me to the phone to get more Tina
Turner tickets when she returns to Boston in September. This time,
we are taking the boys.
</P>
<P>
   Since my 14-year-old happens to like Tina Turner and my
9-year-old has started playing the saxophone, no arm twisting will
be needed. But Mom and Dad do have ulterior motives. We want them
to see a liberated woman in a inspiring display of energy and
optimism. We want them to see so much energy that when they come
home, the word ``tired'' will be retired.
</P>
<P>
   Turner has said, ``I don't feel 60.'' She has said, ``My entire
life has been like one long aerobics class.'' She has said, ``My
figure comes from my work, from all those years of dancing. My
lifestyle has been my exercise, all that sweating onstage and the
singing and the yelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Cher once said of Turner, ``Sometimes when I'm tired or feeling
like `Oh God, I just can't make it,' I think, I bet Tina could do
this. She's like a hurricane.'' Just to get in shape to even play
Turner in the movie version of Turner's autobiography, Angela
Bassett said, ``I had a dialect coach, a singing coach, a
choreographer and a personal trainer for 30 days before the filming
began. I lifted weights and went on a high-protein, no sweets diet
_ egg whites, tuna without mayo, vegetables _ to get Tina's
incredible muscular physique.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew! As there will never be another hurricane like Tina Turner,
I am declaring her farewell tour a national treasure for parents.
Remember, children hate to be shown up by old farts. When they are
trailing the rear on hikes up mountains, you can almost see the
afterburners blaze from the soles of their feet if you drop back,
poke them in the side and say, ``You mean you're going to let your
old man beat you up to the top?''
</P>
<P>
   So I figure Tina Turner can assist us all in achieving greatness
as parents, or at least the great, rare act of rendering your
children speechless. The bargain is simple. OK kids, we'll take you
out to see Tina sing ``What's Love Got to Do With It.'' After that,
the new song of the house is:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You must understand, how the sleight of your hand,
</P>
<P>
   Makes my pulse react,

<P>
   You say you can't see, that dirt at your knee,
</P>
<P>
   You got cataracts?
</P>
<P>
   It's miserable, and intolerable
</P>
<P>
   And now you tell me you need even more sleep
</P>
<P>
   Oh, oh, oh, what's ``tired'' got to do, got to do with it?
</P>
<P>
   What's ``tired,'' but a second-hand emotion?
</P>
<P>
   What's ``tired'' got do do, got to do with it?
</P>
<P>
   Who needs a nap, when Tina's still smokin'?
</P>
<P>
   It may seem to you, that I'm acting confused,
</P>
<P>
   You have not made a dent.
</P>
<P>
   If I tend to look dazed, it's cause I'm amazed,
</P>
<P>
   At your entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   There's a name for it, call it laziness,
</P>
<P>
   Get up off your seat, cause life is not free.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, oh, oh, what's ``tired'' got to do, got to do with it?
</P>
<P>
   What's ``tired,'' but a second-hand emotion?
</P>
<P>
   What's ``tired'' got do do, got to do with it?
</P>
<P>
   Who needs a nap, when Tina's still smokin'?
</P>
<P>
   You are taking on a new direction,
</P>
<P>
   That's what we have to say,
</P>
<P>
   Your grades need a new complexion, even if it scares you to stay
awake.

GIBSON SHOWS A BRAVE HEART IN `THE PATRIOT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE PATRIOT 
Directed by: Roland Emmerich 
Screenplay by: Robert Rodat 
Starring: Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger, Joely Richardson, Jason Isaacs,
Chris Cooper, Tcheky Karyo, Rene Auberjonois, Lisa Brenner, Tom
Wilkinson 
Running time: 158 minutes 
Rated: R (strong war violence) 
Stars: 3 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would be easy to be cynical about ``The Patriot.'' It is,
after all, history according to Hollywood. Charlton Heston led the
Jews to the Promised Land. Mel Gibson wins the American Revolution.
It's hard to resist dismissing ``The Patriot'' as ``Braveheart'' in
a three-cornered hat. But just as ``Braveheart'' was overrated,
``The Patriot'' is likely to be underrated. To my surprise, it won
me over despite its excesses. It's possible to forgive ``The
Patriot'' its Hollywood heroics _ right down to Gibson charging up
over a hill just before what we are told is the decisive battle,
bearing the Stars and Stripes from the saddlebag of a dead soldier,
just in time to rally his ragtag troops.
</P>
<P>
   If the battlefield gestures are pure Hollywood, they at least
have the courage to throw in our faces the butchery of war. This
perhaps is not a surprise, since the script was written by ``Saving
Private Ryan'' screenwriter Robert Rodat. But I wish the film
hadn't reduced the Revolution to a mutual vendetta, as it does,
between Gibson's Benjamin Martin and Jason Isaacs' sadistic British
colonel, responsible for the death of someone close to Martin. It
was a good choice on Gibson's part to mostly turn his face into a
mask of anguish. Although he gets down and dirty as any action hero
in any film this year, he goes the same route as ``Gladiator'' did
a few weeks ago in that he's a farmer who's a reluctant warrior.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson plays Martin as a man conscience-stricken by his own
savagery when he fought in the French and Indian war, afraid of
reaping a harvest of bad karma. There's something dark and reined
in about Gibson's Martin. He's afraid of his own capacity for
violence. When he does go to war, and his weapon of choice turns
out to be the tomahawk, we're not surprised by his proficiency with
it _ or by the frequency with which he's drenched in his enemies'
blood. What is surprising is the film's way of making the carnage
intimate. Resourcefully utilizing its South Carolina locations, it
persuasively conveys the war's impact on a specific community.
</P>
<P>
   While his eldest teenaged son (Heath Ledger) can't wait to fight
the British, Gibson's veteran of the French and Indian War knows
his son's idealism will be eroded pretty quickly by the grim
realities of war. He doesn't want his son to go. One reason the
film is so long (more than 2 1/2 hours), and takes as long to
achieve liftoff as it does, is the time it takes establishing
Martin's reluctance. But once his son plunges into the war, he
follows. By that time, the war has literally spilled onto the front
lawn of his South Carolina plantation.
</P>
<P>
   The colonial rebels are being shredded by the better-equipped,
better-trained British army. Gibson's character is modeled on,
among others, Francis Marion, known as ``The Swamp Fox.'' The
real-life Marion, who kept slaves (he reportedly raped more than
one of them) and hunted Indians for sport, wouldn't have been a
presentable 21st century movie hero. But he also was a pioneer of
guerrilla warfare. Realizing that it would be suicide to try to
defeat the redcoats at their game of disciplined formations firing
away in open fields, Marion employed surprise attacks, then quickly
withdrew into the swamps.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson's patriot (his lifestyle has been sanitized _ the workers
on his plantation are freed slaves who at one point return the
flavor and hide him) retains this tactic. Eventually, he diverts
enough of General Cornwallis' troops to put a dent in the British
ability to fight the war in Virginia. Tom Wilkinson is an amusing
Cornwallis, an aristocrat annoyed that Martin won't fight by the
rules. He isn't a fool. He admonishes his cruel subordinate,
pointing out that the British will want to trade with the Americans
after the war and that it's bad business to antagonize the future
customers any more than necessary. The film also makes clear the
British officers' motivation _ they've been promised large land
grants by King George III. Cornwallis makes only one error, the
classic error of generals, who go into each new war with everything
they needed to win the previous one.
</P>
<P>
   The sterling Chris Cooper is another plus as the Revolutionary
general under no illusions about the difficulties the Americans are
facing. There's a lift, too, from the believably contagious
idealism we're persuaded is animating Ledger's young hothead and
Lisa Brenner, as the spirited young woman he loves. You can feel
the film yielding to market pressures and throwing credibility to
the winds as Gibson launches one of his Mad Mel numbers in the big
showdown we're told is the war's pivotal battle. But there are
trenchant and even moving aspects of ``The Patriot,'' not the least
of which is the unflinching clarity with which it reminds us of
war's horrific costs. It's often corny, but it's never boring, and
it'll sweep you up in its momentum if you give it a chance.

&HT;     SEX EDUCATION GROUP FACES LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PETER HARTLAUB  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Partners in the Welcomed Consensus describe
themselves as one man and several women living together in sexual
harmony, offering classes that teach everything from seduction
methods to a one-hour orgasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this culture there are very few places where people can go
to be trained to expand their orgasm,'' the group explains on its
Web site (www.welcomed.com). ``We are that kind of place.''
</P>
<P>
   But Erwan Davon has other names for the group and its ``training
programs,'' which have been going on for years in San Francisco and
other nearby cities: Pimping. Prostitution. Pandering.
</P>
<P>
   Davon, who said he gave the Welcomed Consensus more than
$136,000 in cash and stock options, sued the group in San Francisco
this month, asking for his money back plus a court order that would
force the group out of business.
</P>
<P>
   The Welcomed Consensus instructors acknowledge open sexual
relations with each other as part of their ``research.'' Davon
contends that they also illegally engage in sex acts with their
clients during sessions, some of which cost thousands of dollars
and involve living with the instructors.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the Welcomed Consensus denied that the group had
sex with its students.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' attorney Mark Divelbiss said, declining to
comment further on the nature of the classes.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the court battle, Davon's lawsuit and
the group's Web site offer an often explicitly detailed look into
what has to be one of the most unusual educational opportunities in
the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Courses are described as labs, with tuition and programs for
graduate students. Most upper-level courses have prerequisites,
although there are no course credits or degrees at the Welcomed
Consensus.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent heart of the Welcomed Consensus is ``R.J.,'' the
only man in the group. He is identified as Robert Testerman in the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Five women listed as general partners also were sued, although
only three of the women are listed on the Web site's biographies
page.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says they all live in Shasta County. The group's Web
site says they started having sex in San Francisco but now reside
at their ranch, called Eagle's Nest, in Shasta County. They still
receive their mail at a San Francisco post office box and host many
of their sessions in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls and an e-mail to members of the Welcomed Consensus
were not returned. The group's lawyer said he did not plan to fight
the legal battle in the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawsuit, at least in our perspective, is unfounded,''
Divelbiss said. ``It doesn't have any legal or factual support.''
</P>
<P>
   Divelbiss said Davon was a former student who might have had
some interest in investing with the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my eyes it's just an attempt to use a public forum to
obtain a settlement,'' Divelbiss said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit does not say what Davon spent the money on, or if he
ever was a student with the group.
</P>
<P>
   Davon's lawyer did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   R.J. and the current instructors acknowledge in their Web site
biographies that he has sex with all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are my best friends, my salvation, my reason for
being,'' R.J. says in his biography. ``One thing I know for sure is
women want action, and three of them want a lot of it, and living
with all these people and teaching courses on sex and relationships
supplies a lot of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's Web site also acknowledges the sexual nature of the
courses that are offered, including more than one that allows
students to live with the group.
</P>
<P>
   For $450 tuition, a student can take ``Adventures in
Sensuality,'' described as an ``advanced sensuality laboratory''
designed for partners.
</P>
<P>
   For $19,000, a student can take the two-week, full-time
``Confirmation Intensive Course.''
</P>
<P>
   The group also offers ``Private Hours,'' at $200 per hour,
giving the buyer a one-on-one ``conversation with a member or
members of Welcomed Consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   The most expensive course, called the ``Validation Program,''
costs $310,000, although no specifics are listed for the class on
the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Davon's lawsuit accuses the group of violating California laws
that prohibit prostitution, pimping, pandering and keeping a house
of ill fame.

LIKABLE CHARACTERS, STANDOUT ACTING MARK `SOUL FOOD' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
SOUL FOOD 
Starring: Nicole Ari Parker, Vanessa Williams, Malinda Williams,
Isaiah Washington, Darrin Dewitt Henson, Boris Kodjoe, Aaron Meeks,
Rockmond Dunbar, Irma P. Hall 
On: Showtime 
Time: Wednesday at 10 p.m. 
Rated: TV14 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the last decade, we TV critics forged yet another cliche
_ the cable-will-save-the-world cliche. You probably know the rap _
about how cable options give viewers more control over what they
watch, how cable competition forces the once all-powerful networks
to try harder, how pay channels free us from commercial
interruption and the dumbing down of scripts. Oh yes, and how cable
and its democratization potential can help bust up the racial
homogeneity (read: whitewashing) that haunts prime time.
</P>
<P>
   And so Showtime deserves a little round of applause for its
efforts on behalf of that cliched but still potent cable dream. Not
only has the channel rescued worthy but controversy-impaired
projects like ``Lolita'' and ``More Tales of the City'' and
produced smart movie fare like ``The Baby Dance,'' but it is making
a sincere attempt to create quality TV series that aren't afraid of
diversity. The shows ``Linc's'' and ``The Hoop Life'' had black
casts, and ``Resurrection Blvd.,'' which premiered Monday, is
rooted in Latino culture. And Wednesdays at 10, Showtime offers
another black-cast series, ``Soul Food,'' which is adapted from the
1997 hit movie of the same title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soul Food'' is a warm, sudsy bath of a show that's easy to
enjoy. As with most nighttime soap operas, the young-and-restless
plot turns come fast and furious and without many nuances, from the
sick infant to the two-timing husband. But the characters are so
likable, the acting is so effortless, the family feel is so
natural, and the look of the show is so pleasingly stylized, you
probably won't care too much.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of ``Soul Food'' are three close sisters, each of
them strong in different ways. The oldest, Teri (Nicole Ari
Parker), is a high-powered lawyer who's addicted to hating the man
who cheated on her. Maxine (Vanessa Williams) is a happily married,
loving, but hotheaded mother of three who pulls out her fists when
necessary. Her son Ahmad provides the show with its sweet voiceover
narration. And Bird (Malinda Williams), the youngest sister, is a
new mother dealing with a well-intentioned but unemployed
ex-convict husband.
</P>
<P>
   These women gain power from one another, sometimes through
laughter, sometimes through anger. They also find inspiration from
their mother, Mama Joe, who died in the movie but appears in
``Providence''-like fantasies in the series. (She's played by the
only actor from the movie, Irma P. Hall.) The show's lead actresses
are all good, but Parker is particularly engaging. She makes her
Teri _ a typical workaholic who needs a good booty call _ more
interesting than she's written.
</P>
<P>
   The premiere, crammed with enough incident and emotion for three
episodes, was directed by Eriq La Salle of ``ER.''

THE REAL WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it too late to ask if we can't just bring back Bill?
</P>
<P>
   Is there a Third Term Caucus I can join?
</P>
<P>
   Because any guy who can act as ringmaster for the unveiling of
the human genone miracle, see in the near-distance the elimination
of the federal deficit, take his presidential sledgehammer to
rocketing prescription costs for the elderly, and make peace
furiously in the Mideast, Ireland, and between the two Koreas, then
that fella has a knack for the job.
</P>
<P>
   I am aware that whole pine forests have been slain, whole
networks dedicated (I'm talking Fox TV and the Boss Fox, Rupert
Murdoch), and whole industries focused (is talk radio an industry
or just audio wrestling?) on the proposition that Clinton is a vile
fellow who deserves to be impeached, jailed, flogged, exiled and
forced to pay off $20 million in legal fees by working as a
counterman at McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   But even his enemies in Congress and The Wall Street Journal's
executive suite are befuddled by the ease with which Battlin' Bill
flits from triumph to triumph, surfing along on the great economic
tidal wave have that characterized his two terms. I have said
before that I don't want a father figure in my president. Don't
need a dad. I don't want a buddy, a blusterer, a scolder, a nag. I
don't need a prez to tell me to eat my broccoli and swallow my
spinach. I want a fair-minded, president, a tough-minded president,
and above all I want a well-minded president, as in smart. The job
is a crusher. Pressures are volcanic. Any chink in a personal or
moral armor, the lava comes rushing in, and they're cooked. They
all fail. They're all flawed. What's vital is how they come back.
Can they take a shot, right on the snoot? And get up for the next
round? Or do they have the china chin that busts on the first
serious contact, and renders the hors de combat for the duration?
</P>
<P>
   His envious enemies call Clinton ``Slick Willie.'' ``He's the
best liar I've ever seen,'' confided a Republican presidential
candidate _ in a tone that conveyed a certain ego-envy. I still
think of Bill as the rube who rode into town on the back of the
turnip truck, and found he was just as smart as the rich kids in
the city. He reads more books in a week, I'll wager, than George W.
reads in a year. Clinton has total recall, a photographic memory,
for faces, books, intellectual arguments, and festering political
saddle sores. Or a babe. Or a well-heeled contributor aching to be
asked for an opinion on some weighty issue other than moolah.
</P>
<P>
   William Jefferson Clinton learned a lot of lessons on the way
up. But learning how to schmooze the rich and powerful was not the
least of them. The boy can charm the birds out of the oleander
bush. Talk a dog off a meat-wagon. Once he locks on to the retinas
of a rich man or a comely woman, something clicks on. His prey
hears the opening strains of ``I only have eyes, for yoooo,
dearrrr.'' Then it's curtains. Where do I sign?
</P>
<P>
   If you are satisfied with George Dubbaya's fumbling rationale
for his execution of 130-odd fellow humans, then get ready for
more. I'm not talking about whether you're for or against the death
penalty _ Clinton executed Ricky Lee Rector, Gore says he's
pro-capital punishment, and Governor George Ryan is the gutsiest
pol in the land for halting executions in Illinois till the
innocent are weeded out of the queue. But when it comes to
explaining complicated issues with lots of ramifications to people
in language they can understand, I fear for the Bush boy.
</P>
<P>
   I understand he has raised $90 million in cash with
not-inconsiderable energy and a certain winsome cowboy charm. I
don't know if I'm ready for four years of fractured syntax and
mangled script-reading.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows Al Gore is no Clinton. But he's had eight years
of watching the master up close. Which makes him a president with a
lot lower learning curve. But nobody looks at Gore and sees
Clinton, unless you're a Republican campaign contributor. Or your
name is Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   I have covered every president since LBJ, put questions to every
one since Nixon (the worst by a landslide) and I think most
Americans are a little too dewey-eyed about their presidential
candidates. Get real, voters; Santa Claus is not coming down the
chimney at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   My notion is that the presidency is a job, and we hire someone
to do that job, and their human frailities and mistakes must be
counter-balanced by substantial strengths, virtues, talent. The
pervasive and invasive news/infotainment biz strips our leaders of
distance, majesty, and the remoteness that conveys power. TV puts
them right in our face, and over-exposure turns them into objects
of ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   I heard a woman groan Monday, after listening to Clinton and
British Prime Minister Tony Blair emote about the human genome
triumph, that Blair came across as ``a syruppy Cyril and Clinton
reminds me of W.C. Fields with his big bulbous nose.'' Fair enough.
Or, unfair enough.
</P>
<P>
   I just have this feeling that one year from now, Clinton's
approval ratings will be higher out of office than they are now.
And that many Americans will be singing, perhaps under their
breath, ``Come back to the White House, Billy Cee, Billy Cee.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

&HT;     TREATMENT RAISES HOPE FOR SENIORS WITH RETINAL DISEASE

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Of all the losses associated with aging, Florence
Kaplan most fears losing her sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blindness is a terrifying, terrifying thought,'' said the
80-year-old resident of Amsterdam, N.Y. But Kaplan came close to
losing the vision in her right eye earlier this year when she was
diagnosed with macular degeneration, a disease that affects the
light-sensitive cells that line the back of the eye, known as the
retina.
</P>
<P>
   The condition affects up to 30 million people worldwide and is
the leading cause of blindness in the United States in adults older
than 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was horrified and shocked,'' Kaplan said after learning her
diagnosis in April. To add to her worries, Kaplan was diagnosed
with ``wet'' macular degeneration, a less common form of the
disease affecting some 200,000 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one knows what causes macular degeneration, the wet
form tends to deteriorate the vision more rapidly than the dry. In
both cases, ophthalmologists have been unable to offer their
patients much hope. ``We don't have a cure for either form of
macular degeneration,'' said Dr. Charles D. Mayron of the Retina
Office in Slingerlands, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians and senior citizens across the country have been
keeping abreast of Visudyne therapy, the newest treatment for wet
macular degeneration, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration in April. ``This is the first pharmacological
treatment that has proven efficacious,'' said Mayron, who has
treated approximately two dozen patients so far.
</P>
<P>
   In clinical studies of 243 patients with wet macular
degeneration, vision improved or remained stable in 67 percent of
patients treated with Visudyne, compared to 39 patients on a
placebo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a high level of desperation,'' said Edmund J.
Aleksandrovich, president of the Macular Degeneration Foundation in
San Jose, Calif. ``People say, `if there is any chance of getting
my sight back, I want to do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Visudyne, manufactured by CIBA Vision, is not a cure.
Scientists believe any such breakthrough is years away. ``It's
somewhat of a milestone, but nowhere like we have a solution,''
Mayron said.
</P>
<P>
   Wet macular degeneration is caused by the abnormal proliferation
of blood vessels beneath the retina. The growth of those blood
vessels eventually damages the retina, which is that part of the
eye that enables us to read and see fine detail.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say women tend to get the disease more often, perhaps
because they live longer. And people with lighter eyes tend to have
a slightly greater risk of developing the condition, according to
Don Anderson, director of the Center for the Study of Macular
Degeneration at the University of California in Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   He expects research over the next five years to reveal a
significant genetic link to the disease, which is already known to
run in families. In the past, the only weapon against wet macular
degeneration was laser therapy.
</P>
<P>
   But using a hot laser on the surface of the eye carried its own
risk. ``In the process of burning the blood vessels, we were
destroying the retina,'' Mayron said. ``The treatment was almost as
worse as the disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Visudyne also uses a laser, but a cold one. The treatment is
two-step. First, a physician injects the drug into the bloodstream,
which then binds to the abnormal blood vessels in the eye. Once
activated by the laser, the drug shrinks the blood vessels. But
while Visudyne has helped some patients, it seems to be a temporary
fix. The therapy, in most people, has to be repeated every three
months.
</P>
<P>
   And that can be expensive. A single treatment of Visudyne can
cost as much as $1,500. Medicare, in most cases, is expected to
pick up the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan believes the treatment is worth it. ``My sight is nowhere
near normal but it's much better than it had been,'' she said.
``It's like a miracle.''

&HT;     PT BOAT CAUGHT IN NEW BATTLE OVER ITS FUTURE

<P>
   KEMAH, Texas _ After toiling six years to restore a rare World
War II combat boat, a group of volunteers is not ready to surrender
PT-309 so it can be displayed outside the Nimitz Museum in
Fredericksburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a travesty to take a perfectly good, seaworthy boat and
stick her in a hole in the ground,'' said Tim Kelley, skipper of
the 78-foot boat now docked at Clear Lake, southeast of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they take her up there, she will rot and decay,'' Kelley
said.
</P>
<P>
   But concern about dry rot was dismissed as a red herring by
Charles Grojean of the Admiral Nimitz Foundation, which spent
$80,000 in 1994 to buy the boat, which was being used for charter
fishing trips.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, which gave the boat to the Texas Department of
Parks and Wildlife, planned for it to become part of its Pacific
Combat Zone display this November.
</P>
<P>
   With time and money invested by both groups, emotions are
heating up over the future of the only remaining torpedo boat known
to have seen combat in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that a bona fide artifact like that ought to be
preserved for future generations,'' Grojean said Tuesday. ``Running
it around in water like that is not preserving it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kelley's group has launched a publicity campaign to convince
state officials to display the boat in Kemah, a town on Galveston
Bay south of Clear Lake.
</P>
<P>
   More than $750,000 has gone into restoring the boat. The
volunteers say they were told they could have some time to display
the restored boat there, and the city of Kemah has passed a
resolution pledging to spend $55,000 to build a dock and visitor
center for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Parks and Wildlife and the museum have taken advantage
of the entire system down here,'' said Mike Frye, an assistant to
Kemah City Councilman Bill King.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volunteers put it back together and got it back in the
water,'' he said. ``Now, it appears that based on the taxpayers
doing all of this work, they've decided that our timetable has been
pushed up so we really can't allow it to be put on display for any
period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   State and foundation officials said they were open to a 1998
request from the city of Kemah to display the boat there two years,
but the time has come to move it.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to keep it in Kemah is supported by former wartime
crewmen of the boat that was named ``Oh Frankie'' after a chance
meeting between its first skipper and singer Frank Sinatra in a New
York nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the boat should remain a viable living example of a
naval vessel, and should remain in the water,'' said Bob Pleasants,
who was second in command on the boat during combat tours in the
Mediterranean Sea more than a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though PT boats gained fame in the Pacific theater of World War
II, PT-309 was used to attack German vessels in the Mediterranean.
Its crew sank five enemy vessels in 75 missions.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1944, the 50-ton vessel featured a double-planked
mahogany hull, and was among about 300 motor patrol torpedo boats
built for the Navy by the Higgins Co. in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the war, PT-309 sold as war surplus for $3,500.
When bought by the foundation, it was a fishing boat called ``Brand
X.''
</P>
<P>
   A bid to keep the boat in Kemah was rejected in May by Parks and
Wildlife Executive Director Andy Sansom, who nevertheless applauded
the volunteers' work.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said he offered to reimburse the Nimitz Foundation for
its outlay on the restoration project, or to restore the exterior
of another old torpedo boat, PT-305, for display in Fredericksburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're open-minded to some extent,'' Kelley said. ``They want
to see our plans for it. They are not saying yes. They opened the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposals outlining the options will be presented to state
officials by July 17, he said.

WOMAN MAY BE WINNING BATTLE TO PRAY AT THE WAILING WALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bonna D. Haberman has a simple dream: One day she wants to be
able to pray at the Western Wall in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch. She wants to wear a prayer shawl and read
from the Torah.
</P>
<P>
   That behavior doesn't raise an eyebrow in Haberman's adopted
hometown of Cambridge, Mass., where as a Jew who is at the same
time radical and orthodox, egalitarian and traditional, she is
welcome in many circles.
</P>
<P>
   But in Jerusalem, where public officials have ceded control of
behavior at the wall to the ultra-Orthodox, Haberman's wearing of
religious clothing and her reading from religious texts
traditionally reserved for men has triggered a violent reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 12 years, Orthodox men have threatened, cursed,
and attacked women praying in groups in the women's section of the
Wall. On occasion, men have hurled excrement or furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Now Haberman, a scholar in the women's studies program at
Brandeis University, thinks her 12-year struggle may be nearing
success in the effort to win equal access for women to one of the
most important sites in Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Supreme Court ruled last month that women should be
allowed to have group services, to wear prayer shawls, and to read
from the Torah at the wall, and the court gave the government six
months to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are furious, and Israel's parliament is considering
legislation that would overturn the Supreme Court decision and
allow jail sentences of up to seven years for women who read from
the Torah at the Western Wall. The wall, also known as the Wailing
Wall, is the last remaining piece of the Second Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Haberman, a 40-year-old mother of five who helped found a group
called Women of the Wall in 1989, heads to Jerusalem this week, and
she hopes to celebrate the Supreme Court victory at the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the area considered to be, for the Jewish people, one
of the most significant and sacred places,'' she said. ``For women
to be present in the sacred space is a fundamental part of the
fixing of the undignified part of human relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   But Haberman is under no illusion that it will be easy to
translate the Supreme Court decision into public policy. Israel's
government could collapse, the parliament could overturn the
decision, or the police could fail to protect women who pray.
</P>
<P>
   Ultra-Orthodox Jews argue that women praying from the Torah
violate the roles assigned to men and women by God.
</P>
<P>
   Haberman spent about five years living in Israel and during that
time prayed at the wall every Friday. On the occasions when her
group had a Torah, Orthodox women would try to tear it away or men
would attack verbally or physically, at times calling the praying
women whores, witches, or Nazis and even praying for their death.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be assaulted at any time is an awful violation, but, in the
middle of prayer, there's a special vulnerability,'' she said.
``Our opponents have been brutal, violent, and have broken so many
of the codes of civil society.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade of hearings by various government commissions
attempting to work out a compromise solution were disastrous,
Haberman said. ``They were extraordinarily degrading and
humiliating events.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she recoils at the proposal that women be jailed for
praying, even though the measure is not expected to pass.
Preliminary approval of the measure by the Knesset caused the
American Jewish Congress to compare Israel to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an appalling situation,'' Haberman said. ``It's
intolerable. To name that prayer by women as a criminal offense is
difficult to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Haberman said she and other women of varying denominations and
nationalities have tried to be patient as they push for change, but
that their patience is running out.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter had her bat mitzvah, and she wasn't able to do it
at the Wall, whereas every Jewish boy can do it at his will,''
Haberman said. ``It's time.''

 PREACHER PERSISTS DESPITE OPPOSITION BY DENOMINATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Tina T. Saxon was just 18 when she announced to her
family that she wanted to be a Baptist preacher.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was swift, she recalls: the fist of her uncle, a
leading deacon at the local church, came slamming down against the
dining room table. ``You show me in the Bible where God told a
woman to preach!'' she remembers him shouting.
</P>
<P>
   It took Saxon decades to answer that question to her own
satisfaction. Today, at age 61, she is the pastor of a small church
she founded six years ago in a rundown and abandoned building in a
public housing development.
</P>
<P>
   But now she finds herself once again defending her right to be a
preacher.
</P>
<P>
   On June 14, the Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's
largest Protestant denomination, voted to declare that women should
not be pastors.
</P>
<P>
   That poses at least a symbolic problem for Saxon. Though she
grew up in a black Baptist church and was ordained as an American
Baptist minister, she chose years ago to affiliate her church with
the Southern Baptist Convention after she was recruited by a
retired black male pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Saxon is the only woman pastor of a Southern Baptist church in
Massachusetts, and she views her denomination's action with a
combination of indifference and anger. At times she says she
doesn't have time or energy to worry about votes like this; at
other times, she is irate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't back off because a bunch of powerful white whatevers
feel I should not be trying to make this a better world, also,''
she said. ``This really is about economics and sexism _ it's about
power _ and they have to come up with God talk to explain it out of
ignorance or sexism or greed.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote does not mean that Saxon or the estimated 35 to 100
other women heading Southern Baptist churches will lose their
posts. The Southern Baptist Convention is decentralized, so the
vote is not binding on individual churches, and the denomination is
also facing a possible schism over its rightward tilt.
</P>
<P>
   The vote also does not mean that Saxon will leave the Southern
Baptist Convention; Saxon said that even today she would encourage
a young woman who felt a call to the ministry to consider a
Southern Baptist church.
</P>
<P>
   Saxon said the denomination's historic opposition to civil
rights for blacks and its current opposition to equality for women
are outweighed by the support she has enjoyed from the New England
leadership of the Southern Baptist Convention, from her fellow
pastors, and even from college-age Southern Baptists from Kentucky
and Texas who have traveled to Boston to help repair her church.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have proved to be very sincere and loving people when it
comes to the work of the kingdom, and that's what it's all about,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Baptist Convention, which reports nearly 16 million
members in 40,000 churches, is theologically conservative and
evangelical. Founded in a break over the issue of slavery with
predominantly Northern churches now represented by the American
Baptist Churches, the Southern Baptist Convention has now
repudiated that position and formally denounced racism in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, where an estimated 15,000 Southern Baptists
represent a tiny percentage of the region's Christians, most
Baptist churches are affiliated with one of several black Baptist
bodies or with the American Baptist Churches. American Baptists
have been ordaining women since 1890, and a majority of the
ministers now being ordained by the denomination in Massachusetts
are female.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 220 Southern Baptist pastors in New England, some
support the denomination's rightward tilt, while others do not.
But, like other evangelical churches in New England, the Southern
Baptists here tend to be far less engaged in denominational
politics than their counterparts in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the South, those people are arguing about the icing on the
cake, but up here we're trying to deal with whether or not there's
going to be a cake,'' said the Rev. Mark D. Acuff, senior pastor of
Grace Baptist Church in Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Acuff said his church would not ordain a woman pastor. But he
wishes the denomination had not codified such a position, and he
said he recoiled when the denomination tried to organize a boycott
of the Walt Disney Co. over the company's support for gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my pulpit, `Follow Jesus' and `Ban Mickey' do not fit in
the same paragraph,'' Acuff said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Nicolas S. Zaccardi, pastor of First Baptist Church in
Watertown, said he has no problem with the leadership of women. He
grew up in Pentecostal churches, which are generally more
hospitable to women pastors. But Zaccardi also said he pays no
attention to denominational politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know about the decision,'' Zaccardi said. ``Down
South, it's a whole different climate, where it's much more
Christianized, and they can sit back and talk about things like
that. Up in New England, we're more like missionaries, and we're
just trying to have a growing congregation.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in a region where evangelicals avoid political battles
to focus on evangelization, Saxon's position is filled with irony.
</P>
<P>
   She is a black woman who heads a church in a denomination that
was created to support slavery and that just two years ago declared
that women should ``submit graciously to their husbands.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Saxon also has much more pressing problems to worry
about. The future of her church is in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   She is essentially a squatter. Her congregation holds services
on the first three floors of an abandoned nine-story building at
the Bromley-Heath housing project. Saxon has no lease on the
property, so last year the Boston Housing Authority decided to
evict her, contending that running a church in an abandoned
apartment building violates the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Saxon said the BHA has since promised to let her stay, but she
has nothing in writing. BHA spokeswoman Lydia Agro said only that
``we're trying to work out a solution.'' But pending a definite
decision, Saxon continues to conduct church services, offer an AIDS
ministry, and plan for Bible camp and school programs.
</P>
<P>
   Her makeshift church is marked with a spray-painted white cross
over the door. As she entered the makeshift church one recent day,
she paused to rue the beer bottle and the Devil Creme snack cake
wrapper amid the carefully tended flowers behind a chain-link
fence. Once inside, she ignored the peeling paint and
malfunctioning plumbing, heating, and wiring and focused instead on
the pews her congregants made and the faux stained-glass windows
she created, using decals on frosted glass.
</P>
<P>
   Without a hint of irony, she stepped onto the cracked pavement
of a courtyard once overrun with drug dealers, looked past the
giant brick planters filled with dry dirt and the dandelions
springing up through the asphalt, and said, ``Isn't this beautiful?
Imagine kids and balloons and ice cream.''
</P>
<P>
   Raised in black Baptist churches in Tampa, Fla., and Washington,
D.C., Saxon became an increasingly fervent believer. At 17, she was
jokingly called an evangelist, and at 18 she claimed a miraculous
healing; one morning she woke up and, she says, the stub of a sixth
finger on her hand since birth had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Saxon has worked or worshiped in a variety of Christian
churches: American Baptist, black Baptist, Nazarene, United Church
of Christ, Unitarian Universalist, even Swedenborgian societies and
Christian Science. And she has moved between predominantly black
and white worlds.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, she left a black Baptist church over its
indifference to drug abuse and pursued political activism through
the League of Women Voters before running unsuccessfully as a
Republican candidate for school board. In Massachusetts she worked
in a number of affluent white suburban churches before deciding to
found Disciples Baptist Church in an effort to minister to a
low-income black population plagued by drugs and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Saxon remembers even at age 6 noticing the inequality faced by
women in church life. Her grandmother would iron and starch the
altar cloth and bake the unleavened bread for communion, but then
had to step aside to let the men perform the ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she has little patience for the argument that the New
Testament prohibits women pastors. She says the apostle Paul, an
opponent of women pastors, ``was a product of his culture, of his
kind, of his tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are all in Christ, we can all do whatever the heck we
want to do with our gifts and our talents,'' she said. ``I follow
Jesus Christ.''

BUOYED BY DOLLAR'S STRENGTH, MORE STUDENTS ARE STUDYING ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a fortunate coincidence that Sara David picked this
summer to study abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since her freshman year at Brandeis University, she wanted
to study overseas. But the 19-year-old junior was tentative about
the cost. And when she decided earlier this year to study politics
at Boston University's program in London, she knew the price would
be more than a typical semester in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what turned out to be good luck for David has served as a
stimulus for thousands of students signing up to study abroad,
especially in Europe, this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar, cresting at a 15-year peak against European
currencies, has helped create a surge of students enrolling in
study-abroad programs. Local universities and national study-abroad
organizations are reporting significant enrollment increases, some
with 30 percent more students than last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes it so much easier to travel and buy things,''
said David in a phone interview from London. ``I'm now traveling
every weekend. I don't know if I would have been able to if the
dollar wasn't so strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The crush of students studying abroad this summer is part of a
larger trend of Americans studying overseas. Although still only 9
percent of US college students study abroad, the numbers have
doubled in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1987-1988 academic year, about 60,000 US students studied
abroad; between 1998 and 1999 an estimated 122,000 undergraduates
took classes overseas, according to the latest data from the
Institute of International Education, an umbrella organization for
such programs in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Without accounting for the dollar's 12 percent climb against the
Euro in the past six months, the number of students studying abroad
has jumped by more than 20 percent since the academic years
1996-1997, according to the institute.
</P>
<P>
   The main factors influencing the steady increase over recent
years include the roaring US economy _ making it possible for more
students to afford studying outside the country _ and a rising
awareness among students that a global economy requires an
understanding of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that a favorable exchange rate helps, but
that's only part of the most recent story,'' said Todd Davis,
director of the institute's higher education resource group.
``Study abroad is increasingly an integral part of a college
student's education. And international experience is a major plus
in differentiating students when they enter the job market.''
</P>
<P>
   Many study-abroad programs in Massachusetts have also benefited
from the boom.
</P>
<P>
   At Boston University, which has one of the nation's largest
programs with about 1,600 students studying in 13 countries,
enrollment in this summer's programs is up by nearly 30 percent
from last year.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, a lack of student interest nearly led officials
at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst to scrap their
study-abroad programs. Now, they have more applications than spots
for classes in countries ranging from Israel to India.
</P>
<P>
   And at Boston College, enrollment for the school's international
programs has grown by almost 20 percent every year since the early
part of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the interesting things we've noticed is that people
aren't complaining about how much they have to pay, like they used
to do,'' said Marian St. Onge, director of Boston College's Center
for International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   While studying overseas is easier when salaries at home are high
and a strong dollar reduces the cost of everything from food to
rent, studying abroad is not cheap. On average, when plane tickets,
required travel, and long-distance phone calls are factored in,
studying overseas is almost always more expensive than a typical
college semester in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason Nicole Portley, a 19-year-old junior at Boston
College, said she'll be able to afford studying in Senegal this
fall is because of a government grant. But thanks to the dollar,
assuming it holds its strength through the next academic year, she
should have some petty cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great if the dollar stays at its current level,''
she said. ``I'm hoping to hit a lot of other countries in the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   While students may be less concerned about the cost, not every
study-abroad program has benefited from the boom. As demand has
increased, so has the competition. Now, some 1,000 universities and
colleges offer about 5,000 study-abroad programs, according to the
Institute of International Education.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one longtime player in the field concedes the
squeeze effect. Unlike many other schools, Syracuse University
hasn't reaped the benefits of higher enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our programs are more expensive compared to others,''
explained Jon Booth, deputy director of Syracuse's International
Programs Aboard. ``And there's a negative side of the good economy:
People are going to work rather than going to school. That hurts
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as more students realize the benefits of studying abroad,
Syracuse expects to join in the industrywide gains. Until then,
however, the program's officials are resigned to watch as a
resurgent dollar lifts many of their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Beaver College in Glenside, Pa., one of the dominant players in
the field of international studies with more than 2,000 students in
its far-flung programs, has seen enrollment double since the 1991
Gulf War, when many students decided to stay home. And this summer,
the college has registered 12 percent more students to study abroad
than last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment at the Chicago-based Institute for the International
Education of Students has risen by 31 percent this year in its
eight summer programs. In 17 other summer programs it organizes for
various US universities in Europe, the number of students is up 26
percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is having an effect beyond the general growth in the
market,'' said Carla Slawson, IES's vice president of marketing and
recruitment. ``The most obvious explanation is the strength of the
dollar.''

leaving the United States, or hear the Miami relatives appeal.
Barring some desparate last-minute attempt in another federal
court, at 4 p.m. EDT, his father Juan Miguel Gonzalez may finally
return with his son and family to Cuba _ which they apparently plan
to do on a 5 p.m. EDT chartered flight out of Washington Dulles
International Airport. What will be the reaction in the

streets. It's powered by a Chevy engine and has the occasional
Cadillac part inside. And, he's got a large poster of the late
Syrian President Hafez Assad in the windshield. At the garage zone
on the edge of the capital, workers hammer the chrome trim around
the fins of a 1959 Buick. They scramble for parts to fit the motley
fleet brought in for repairs. They polish up a Bel Air station
wagon, a 1963 Mercedes, old Skoda's and Fiats. A closed economy and
high taxes make it hard to get cars in Syria, so drivers and
mechanics keep the old ones running. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Cooperstown, one of upstate New York's
hottest tourist draws thanks to the Baseball Hall of Fame, has a
new attraction: Bear Pond Winery.
</P>
<P>
   Located a dozen miles south of Cooperstown in the hamlet of
Milford Center, Bear Pond is attempting to make the most of its
connection to the national pastime. The wines include All Star
Chardonnay, Grand Slam Champagne and Fielder's Choice Rosario.
</P>
<P>
   Owned and operated by Hank and Joan Nicols, who for a number of
years have grown grapes on their property in Cooperstown, which
includes a small lake named Bear Pond, the winery has formed an
unofficial partnership with Brotherhood Winery in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   While Bear Pond waits for the grapes the Nicols planted earlier
this year on their five-acre winery to mature, many of its wines
are being bottled at Brotherhood using that winery's grapes. The
Nicols are also buying grape juice from various Finger Lakes
wineries, allowing them to age a burgundy and chardonnay in oak
barrels at the Bear Pond winery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first wines we made on site to sell sold out almost
immediately,'' said Hank Nicols, whose full-time job is director of
system support at Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown. ``Our production
probably will never be able to keep up with demand.''
</P>

   Bear Pond wines sell for between $7 (Grizzly Red Burgundy) and
$12 (Castle Cabernet Sauvignon). There are 15 varieties available,
including an alcohol-free grape juice called Goldilocks' Favorite
($4). The labels have a distinctive bear paw print, the signature
sign at the winery.
</P>
<P>
   The winery opened Memorial Day weekend and held its grand
opening June 17-18. It is so new that James Tresize, president of
the New York State Wine &AMP; Grape Foundation, had not heard of Bear
Pond when he was reached at his office in the Finger Lakes. There
were 140 wineries operating in New York as of Jan. 1, according to
Tresize.

&HT;     IT'S A BERRY NICE SEASON FOR SUCCULENT FRUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN GRIFFIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Before the world shrank, allowing fresh fruits and
vegetables from once-distant continents to fill grocery shelves
year-round, anticipation grew as the seasonal arrival of old
favorites approached.
</P>
<P>
   April brought the first asparagus, crisp and green as an apple.
Late May or early June meant vine-ripened tomatoes, blood-red and
bursting with flavor. Pumpkins, of course, seemed to grow on
schedule in late October.
</P>
<P>
   Now we take it for granted that we can get these and all other
foods whenever we want, courtesy of overnight shipping and
greenhouses in places like Chile and Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Yet somehow berries have survived produce's endless summer.
Sure, you can find strawberries in mid-December, but we all know
they are going to be hard, white and a pale imitation of what comes
fresh and locally.
</P>
<P>
   Raspberries picked in spring are a deep, almost purple red,
their drupelets _ the individual sections, each containing its own
seed _ filled with an irresistible sweet-tart nature that sends
paroxysms of pleasure across your taste buds. I can remember as a
child fighting off the birds to gather a few handfuls from the
bushes in our back yard. No matter how successful I was, there were
never enough of those amazing morsels. Certainly there were never
enough to share with the rest of my family or even to make it from
the bushes to the house not 25 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   It is too hot in South Texas to grow flavorful raspberries, says
Baxter Adams, owner of Love Creek Orchards. But the region produces
boysenberries, a cross among a raspberry, a blackberry and a
loganberry. And blackberry season has just come to a close at his
Devine farm.
</P>
<P>
   The blackberry season was a bit longer than usual this year,
thanks to the rains and to new varieties, such as the Kiowa, which
will ``produce berries for nearly two months, instead of two
weeks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Texas also boasts the dewberry, which is smaller, tarter and
wilder than the blackberries found elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   This is prime blueberry picking season for Texas, and farms to
the east are harvesting the bushels of blue gold, perfect for pies,
cobblers, muffins and more. Blueberries also have garnered a great
deal of press lately because they have been found to be a major
source of antioxidants that fight cancer, heart disease and other
degenerative conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Berries as a whole have captured our fancy because they are much
more flavorful than other big fruit, says Damien Watel, chef and
owner of Bistro Vatel. So much so, in fact, that Watel uses them in
salads, with foie gras and in desserts, including a blueberry tart
with an almond crust.
</P>
<P>
   Given the short season in which truly fresh berries are
available, it's no surprise that people develop a craving for them,
Watel says. Certainly, their fragile nature and their rarity
combine to make them more expensive than apples or oranges.
</P>
<P>
   Once the berries have been harvested, they are refrigerated
immediately in an attempt to extract a longer shelf life. This also
means that if you can't pick your own, you should buy only those
that are refrigerated at the grocery, unless you plan to use them
immediately, Adams says. Otherwise, refrigerate them at home and
use them within a day or two at the most because mold will likely
form.
</P>
<P>
   Berries shouldn't be washed until immediately before using as
the water can damage the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   If fresh berries in season are not available, opt for frozen.
Just remember to drain the juice before measuring.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, freeze your own. ``As long as the fruit is freshly
picked and tightly wrapped to prevent freezer burn, it defrosts
with much of its original sparkle intact,'' according to
``Gardener's Community Cookbook'' (Workman Publishing, $19.95).

   This story, for Thursday papers, was filed Tuesday evening:
</P>
<P>
   RACE-PAPER (Akron, Ohio) _ In New York in 1994, Carl Chancellor
and Bob Dyer looked like tourists, snapping pictures at the Statue
of Liberty, savoring Jamaican food at a trendy restaurant, clinking
beer bottles and wineglasses in heady toasts back at their hotel.
More than tourists, they were colleagues out on the town
celebrating. Chancellor and Dyer were part of a team of reporters
for The Akron Beacon Journal that had explored the racial attitudes
of this city of 215,000 people. Their series earned the paper
journalism's big award, the Pulitzer Prize. In Akron, there were
congratulatory speeches for a staff that had united behind the
series and gloried in having been a healing force in the city. The
Beacon Journal also tried to lead by example. Shortly after the
series ended, it introduced a lineup of columnists reflecting ``the
perfect demographic,'' as Dyer put it. They included a black woman
and a white woman as well as Chancellor, who is black, and Dyer,
who is white. The paper, it seemed, had become a proud model of
racial enlightenment. Which made it all the more startling when,
just a year later, the jubilation began to fade _ for the men and
the newsroom. Troubled by the state of race relations, The Beacon
Journal had gone further than most newspapers to investigate the
gap between blacks and whites and to understand why it had not
closed. It found mistrust and misperceptions, frustrations and
tensions; it even looked inward, discovering much the same in its
own newsroom. It had found, it seemed, a way to talk about race.
And yet even here, in a place where men and women make a living
seeking answers to questions and using words well, communication
can break down. And race still seeps back in. Many among the 157
people on the news staff _ 15 percent of whom are black and 4
percent other minorities _ say that although the city's racial
climate may have improved because of the series, seven years later,
the newspaper itself has shown less progress. By Dana Canedy. (6240

   CHASE-INVEST (New York) _ For all its success in commercial
banking on a global scale, Chase Manhattan Bank has had an image
problem in the clubby precincts of Wall Street. When Chase agreed
last month to buy the Beacon Group _ an investment banking boutique
started by Geoffrey T. Boisi, a former star at Goldman Sachs _ for
an estimated $450 million, it looked to some like yet another
expensive acquisition in a piecemeal attempt at building an
investment banking presence. But it actually signals a big change

and that Boisi would become his boss. By Laura Holson.

dissents in two abortion rights cases. Gore says those justices
would be the ``model'' for the kind of judges Texas Gov. George W.
Bush would name to the court if he were elected president. By

   CUBA-JEWS (Havana) _ According to the Bible, it took Moses 40
years to lead the ancient Hebrews out of the desert and into the
promised land _ about the same amount of time it has taken Cuba's
small Jewish community to get back on its feet under Communist
rule. Depleted by departures since Fidel Castro seized power in
1959, Cuba's Jewish community of 1,500 is rebuilding itself. By DAN

he will be anointed as the Democratic Party's first presidential
nominee of the new millennium. The worst because Gore has been
steadily sinking behind Bush in the public opinion polls. By ROBERT

   CIR-WEB-SEARCH (Undated) _ Five years ago, search engines seemed
like the Web's salvation. Today, they need some saviors of their
own. When search engines first appeared, they were hailed for
accomplishing two things that could not possibly be done by people
on any large scale: search engines could find and index Web sites
almost as soon as they appeared. And they could almost
instantaneously match a page with a single keyword. But today, the
promise of automation has been tempered by the Web's success. There
are now more than one billion Web pages, and doubling every eight
months. Keeping up with that growth has been nearly impossible. To
cope, many search engines have concluded that simply indexing more
pages is not the answer. Instead, they have decided to rely on the
one resource that was once considered a cop-out: human judgment.
Search engines have become more like cyborgs, part human, part
machine. By Lisa Guernsey.

   CIR-CHINA-GAMES (Beijing) _ Three a.m. on a summer Friday in
Beijing. A smoke-filled room is packed with men, faces lighted by
computer monitors, adrenaline running from online combat. Bicycles
clutter the alley outside the door under the sign that reads NG
Cafe. The men are muttering into their headsets, discussing attack
strategies with teammates seated only a few computers away. NG Cafe
is a net cafe or a wangba, which serve as late-night entertainment
venues for hundreds of Beijing residents. The putative reason the
wangbas operate is to provide online access. But the global scope
of the Internet seemed mostly an afterthought in a room where 18 of
the 20 computers are engaged in electronic warfare with opponents
sitting nearby. The fact that the government considers the playing
of computer games in wangbas illegal has not stopped thousands of
them, and their cousins, game parlors, (which typically do not
provide Internet access, just locally networked computers) from
springing up across China. But the proliferation of wangbas and
game parlors in the last three years has vexed a government that
aspires to monitor social, political and economic trends. Wangbas,
the government believes, have the potential to alter all three. By

   SEA-SHELLS (New York) _ The lowly mollusk should rightly be
credited with creating the world's first beach house in the
brilliant form of the sea shell, those Cambrian-era dwellings that
today are sometimes prized and polished, and sometimes trampled
underfoot. Christopher Gow, importer, creator of objets, and
consummate handyman, would probably live in a sea shell if he could
figure out how. A longtime fan and student of whelks, conchs,
periwinkles, murexes, et al, he is also the founder of Ruzzetti &AMP;
Gow, a Manhattan-based company that gathers shells around the
world, silver-coats them in Rome, and uses them to adorn antique
and contemporary frames, chandeliers and mirrors. He sells sea
shells far from the sea shore. By David Colman.

   WEST-PALM-LIVING (West Palm Beach, Fla.) _ ``The best thing
about this neighborhood is you can step outside to get the paper
and not see anybody you know,'' said Mario Nievera. Which can be a
blessing, he added, ``because we live pretty public lives here.''
Here is Palm Beach, a posh playground for Vanderbilts, Astors and
their ilk since the 1920s, and Nievera is not being boastful about
the high-profile existence shared by him and his partner, Robert
Janjigian. A gregarious, notebook-wielding presence at cocktail
parties and charity events, Janjigian, 42, is the fashion editor of
the Palm Beach Daily News, known as The Shiny Sheet for the paper's
slick finish. The gardens that Nievera, 35, creates for members of
the local fete set show up in Architectural Digest. Yet their
primary residence is comfortably modest. So is its location.
Sixty-seven miles north of Miami, West Palm is Palm Beach's

   MINORITIES-HOME-OWNERS (Undated) _ As the United States roars
through the year 2000 still in the midst of the longest housing

issued this week by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard
University. By Tracie Rozhon. (Will move in `l' category)

   HARDY-PLANTS (Undated) One morning in early June, Dr. Peter del
Tredici led the way around the Arnold Arboretum at Harvard to some
of the beautiful old plants he says are tough enough to ride the
roller coaster of recent climate changes. Among them is the Chinese
fringe tree (Chionanthus retusas), with its masses of little white
blossoms covering its broad branches like a silken shawl. The
fragrance was so intoxicating I wanted to open my arms and walk
right into it. The arboretum, founded in 1872 and designed by
Frederick Law Olmsted, rambles for 265 acres over the hills of
Jamaica Plain, Mass. As plant explorers continue to add to the
collection of 7,000 woody plants, it stands as a vast repository of
the temperate world's hardiest specimens. It's Del Tredici's living
laboratory, where he observes, almost daily, which plants survive
the ups and downs of contemporary weather. By Anne Raver.

THE REASONS CHEFS NAME THEIR CREATIONS AFTER THE PEOPLE THEY LOVE _
AND HATE

   It's called kissing up.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the dishes we know as ``classics'' today are the results
of old-time chefs toadying up to their bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Take beef Stroganoff, a dish so familiar that there are even
frozen containers of it in supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Beef Stroganoff was named for Count Pavel Stroganoff, a bon
vivant of the Gay Nineties. A noted gourmet, as well as a dignitary
at the court of Czar Alexander III and a member of the Imperial
Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg, Stroganoff lives in our hearts
as a combination of sour cream and beef to ladle over noodles.
</P>
<P>
   And the list goes on. Auguste Escoffier, THE celebrity chef at
the turn of the century, came up with peach Melba to honor opera
singer Nellie Melba. Melba toast, the thin toast/cracker familiar
to legions of dieters, was also created by Escoffier for the divine
Miss M.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken Tetrazzini was created for another opera singer who
loved her food, the Italian coloratura soprano Luisa Tetrazzini,
although the chef of note has never been noted.
</P>
<P>
   Even ballerinas got their due from the kitchen. Russian
ballerina Anna Pavlova was honored in Australia with the creation
of a dessert made of meringue to resemble a tutu.
</P>
<P>
   These dishes named for women also marked another trend of the
time: It was beginning to be acceptable for proper women to eat in
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Then you've got the dishes awarded to conquering heroes _ a
smart move by chefs with a strong sense of self-preservation.
There's chicken Marengo, served to Napoleon after he won the battle
of the same name. And then there's beef Wellington, named for the
Iron Duke who met Napoleon at Waterloo.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Shirley Temple, the darling of midcentury cinema.
It was the Brown Derby Restaurant in Hollywood, knowing on which
side its bread was buttered, that came up with that nonalcoholic
tribute to innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Not so innocent was the kiss-up to John D. Rockefeller by the
owner of Antoine's Restaurant in New Orleans. Due to a shortage of
snails at the turn of the century, restaurants turned to the native
oyster as a substitute.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, though, oysters were rarely consumed heated. Jules
Alciatore concocted oysters baked and served on a bed of greens _
the color of money.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the naming thing causes indigestion for the creator.
The chef at Delmonico's in New York City was brought a recipe in
1876 by sea captain Ben Wenberg. The recipe was a big hit with
diners, and restaurant owner Charles Delmonico honored the captain
by naming the dish lobster a la Wenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Delmonico and the captain had a disagreement, and
Delmonico switched around the letters to make lobster a la Newberg.
Eventually, the spelling changed, but we still have lobster Newburg
with us today.

   BEEF STROGANOFF
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 to 2 pounds beef sirloin, cut into strips 1/2 inch thick
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 stick butter
</P>
<P>
   4 to 6 green onions, white part only, chopped
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   1 beef bouillon cube, dissolved in 1 cup hot water
</P>
<P>
   10-ounce can beef consomme
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   6-ounce can mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sauterne wine
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sour cream
</P>
<P>
   Remove all fat from the beef. Cut the beef into 2-inch strips
across the grain of the meat. Salt and pepper the strips. Heat the
butter in a Dutch oven and brown the beef, turning frequently to
brown evenly. Set the meat aside and cook the onions until they are
transparent. Set the onions aside. Add the flour to the drippings
and mix well. Return the meat and onions to the Dutch oven, and add
beef bouillon cube, water and beef consomme. Stir the mixture until
it is smooth. Add mustard, cover and cook very slowly for 1 hour or
until the meat is tender. Add the undrained mushrooms, sauterne and
sour cream. Serve over rice or noodles.

<P>
   Carnitas are little cubes of meat, usually pork, roasted until
they are fairly crisp. Generally the cooking process is quite long
because large chunks of meat are roasted. Here we've speeded up the
process using small pieces of meat. They have been seasoned with
the appropriate spices of Mexico, the home of carnitas, which means
little meats.
</P>
<P>
   While potato salad is probably not an authentic dish, the
seasonings in this version with tomatoes makes it an appropriate
and complementary dish to the spicy carnitas. Cumin and cilantro,
an herb I love, but some love to hate, give the potatoes and
tomatoes the Mexican touch. Toasting the cumin enhances its flavor
and its aroma.
</P>
<P>
   Local tomatoes should be coming to market soon in your
neighborhood, if they are not there already. During their fabulous
short season you ought to give up on what the local supermarket is
offering from far away and stick with the farmers' market near you,
the roadside stand, or if you are lucky and industrious, your own
back yard.
</P>
<P>
   You can never have too many local tomatoes.
</P>
<P>

 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a fortunate coincidence that Sara David picked this
summer to study abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since her freshman year at Brandeis University, she wanted
to study overseas. But the 19-year-old junior was tentative about
the cost. And when she decided earlier this year to study politics
at Boston University's program in London, she knew the price would
be more than a typical semester in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what turned out to be good luck for David has served as a
stimulus for thousands of students signing up to study abroad,
especially in Europe, this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar, cresting at a 15-year peak against European
currencies, has helped create a surge of students enrolling in
study-abroad programs. Local universities and national study-abroad
organizations are reporting significant enrollment increases, some
with 30 percent more students than last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes it so much easier to travel and buy things,''
said David in a phone interview from London. ``I'm now traveling
every weekend. I don't know if I would have been able to if the
dollar wasn't so strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The crush of students studying abroad this summer is part of a
larger trend of Americans studying overseas. Although still only 9
percent of US college students study abroad, the numbers have
doubled in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1987-1988 academic year, about 60,000 US students studied
abroad; between 1998 and 1999 an estimated 122,000 undergraduates
took classes overseas, according to the latest data from the
Institute of International Education, an umbrella organization for
such programs in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Without accounting for the dollar's 12 percent climb against the
Euro in the past six months, the number of students studying abroad
has jumped by more than 20 percent since the academic years
1996-1997, according to the institute.
</P>
<P>
   The main factors influencing the steady increase over recent
years include the roaring US economy _ making it possible for more
students to afford studying outside the country _ and a rising
awareness among students that a global economy requires an
understanding of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that a favorable exchange rate helps, but
that's only part of the most recent story,'' said Todd Davis,
director of the institute's higher education resource group.
``Study abroad is increasingly an integral part of a college
student's education. And international experience is a major plus
in differentiating students when they enter the job market.''
</P>
<P>
   Many study-abroad programs in Massachusetts have also benefited
from the boom.
</P>
<P>
   At Boston University, which has one of the nation's largest
programs with about 1,600 students studying in 13 countries,
enrollment in this summer's programs is up by nearly 30 percent
from last year.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, a lack of student interest nearly led officials
at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst to scrap their
study-abroad programs. Now, they have more applications than spots
for classes in countries ranging from Israel to India.
</P>
<P>
   And at Boston College, enrollment for the school's international
programs has grown by almost 20 percent every year since the early
part of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the interesting things we've noticed is that people
aren't complaining about how much they have to pay, like they used
to do,'' said Marian St. Onge, director of Boston College's Center
for International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   While studying overseas is easier when salaries at home are high
and a strong dollar reduces the cost of everything from food to
rent, studying abroad is not cheap. On average, when plane tickets,
required travel, and long-distance phone calls are factored in,
studying overseas is almost always more expensive than a typical
college semester in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason Nicole Portley, a 19-year-old junior at Boston
College, said she'll be able to afford studying in Senegal this
fall is because of a government grant. But thanks to the dollar,
assuming it holds its strength through the next academic year, she
should have some petty cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great if the dollar stays at its current level,''
she said. ``I'm hoping to hit a lot of other countries in the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   While students may be less concerned about the cost, not every
study-abroad program has benefited from the boom. As demand has
increased, so has the competition. Now, some 1,000 universities and
colleges offer about 5,000 study-abroad programs, according to the
Institute of International Education.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one longtime player in the field concedes the
squeeze effect. Unlike many other schools, Syracuse University
hasn't reaped the benefits of higher enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our programs are more expensive compared to others,''
explained Jon Booth, deputy director of Syracuse's International
Programs Aboard. ``And there's a negative side of the good economy:
People are going to work rather than going to school. That hurts
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as more students realize the benefits of studying abroad,
Syracuse expects to join in the industrywide gains. Until then,
however, the program's officials are resigned to watch as a
resurgent dollar lifts many of their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Beaver College in Glenside, Pa., one of the dominant players in
the field of international studies with more than 2,000 students in
its far-flung programs, has seen enrollment double since the 1991
Gulf War, when many students decided to stay home. And this summer,
the college has registered 12 percent more students to study abroad
than last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment at the Chicago-based Institute for the International
Education of Students has risen by 31 percent this year in its
eight summer programs. In 17 other summer programs it organizes for
various US universities in Europe, the number of students is up 26
percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is having an effect beyond the general growth in the
market,'' said Carla Slawson, IES's vice president of marketing and
recruitment. ``The most obvious explanation is the strength of the
dollar.''

TENSION BETWEEN TOP IRANIAN AUTHORITIES EVIDENT IN LATEST MOVES  
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ With the first anniversary of pro-democracy
student riots at Tehran University approaching, the Iranian
authorities took several actions Wednesday that could both provoke
and placate the reformers who have been under severe attack over
the past three months by hard-line clergymen.
</P>
<P>
   In one move, a court here in the capital sent two well-known
reformist lawyers to jail without trials, accusing them of
insulting public officials. One, Mohsen Rahami, represented the
students who were injured last July 8 by police officers and
right-wing vigilantes who attacked their dormitory. The other,
Shirin Ebadi, is a prominent human rights lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's supreme
leader, abruptly fired the commander of the national police, who
was blamed by the student protesters for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei gave no reason for the dismissal of the commander,
Brigadier Gen. Hedayatollah Loftian. Twenty police officers,
including Loftian's deputy, have been on trial for their actions in
the campus assault, but no verdict has been announced. Several
students were tried last year _ in secret _ and sentenced to death
for their role in riots that followed the dormitory attack.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly paradoxical actions Wednesday reflect a tug-of-war
in the highest reaches of the Iranian government between
conservatives who fear the growing power of reformers and the
liberal activists who want to wrest the judiciary and security
forces from the hands of religious hardliners.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between the forces could also be seen in other
pronouncements Wednesday by the country's top two leaders, who have
rarely taken such diametrically opposing public views.
</P>
<P>
   President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric who has promoted
the rule of law and freedom of expression, said in a speech that
individual rights should not be trampled in the pursuit of law and
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a system creates peace in a society by using force,
violence and intimidation, it has secured a temporary peace in a
cemetery in which people are nothing more than animated corpses,''
said Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   He also made one of his strongest defenses to date of press
freedom, calling on the judiciary to resist political pressure and
to clearly define what constitutes an offense against the system by
writers and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate statement broadcast on state radio, Khamenei, who
holds ultimate political and religious authority, called on the
courts to resist attempts to ``undermine the authority and dignity
of the judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the president swept elections earlier this year
and now control the Iranian parliament. They have launched an
attack on the court system over the past three weeks and pledged to
loosen restrictions on the press and political parties.
</P>
<P>
   But the conservatives who lost control of the parliament have
rallied against their opponents, largely through the court system
and through their influence over Khamenei.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since late May, judges have summarily closed 20 newspapers and
magazines associated with the pro-Khatami forces, with the latest
closure this week. Courts have also jailed five reformist writers
and ordered the arrest of all the Iranian participants at a
conference on democracy that took place in Berlin in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The judges have accused all those arrested of violating Islamic
principles, a criticism also made by Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   The coming anniversary of the Tehran University disturbances has
added tension to the conflict. A student group has announced that
it intends to hold a demonstration to mark the date. A right-wing
militia that reports, ultimately, to the supreme leader, has asked
for permission to hold a counter-demonstration at the gates to the
university.

&HT;     HUGE DROP IN PESO NOT EXPECTED AFTER MEXICAN ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AISSATOU SIDIME and BONNIE PFISTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ For the first time since the 1970s, the Mexican
presidential election may not wreak havoc on the peso.
</P>
<P>
   Border banks and trade-related businesses that would feel the
pinch of a plummet have seen few signs that the election on Sunday
will send the peso into a free fall.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, a stronger economy, a more stable political
climate and the fact that more business in Mexico is conducted in
dollars bolster the peso.
</P>
<P>
   When experts on Mexico look for warning signs of a looming
economic dip, they first look at banks. But there is no sign of
trouble at border banks this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican nationals typically juggle their deposits in American
banks during Easter visits, at the end of each year and just before
a presidential election. So border banks that are at the center of
U.S.-Mexico trade ``live and die on what's happening in Mexico,
just like we live and die with what's happening in the U.S.,'' said
Dennis Nixon, chairman of International Bancshares Corp., the
parent of International Bank of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, just before the peso plummeted 50 percent, banks
shipped only one-tenth of the dollars to U.S. banks that they
normally would send. This trickle was offset by Mexicans' spending
more dollars in stores before the devaluation, according to Keith
Phillips, a senior economist at the San Antonio branch of the
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, net currency deposits dropped 15 percent in 1994, an
indication that Mexicans hoarded dollars to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   This year, as of the end of May, ``we have not seen in overall
dollars that receipts are down,'' Phillips said. ``There's not been
a big hoarding of dollars this year.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the 2000 data are skewed a bit because people hoarded
money due to fears about the year 2000 computer bug, Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   But a look at another important clue _ how many pesos are being
converted into dollars and left in U.S. accounts _ shows that
increases are ``less than in 1994,'' said Gerry Schwebel, executive
vice president for international business at IBC, which far
outpaces other border banks in the value of its Mexican accounts.
</P>
<P>
   IBC, the Laredo-based bank that long has aggressively marketed
to Mexican nationals looking for stable places to stash currency or
to borrow for trade-oriented businesses, has seen a slight bump in
the past 90 days in the number of Mexican customers converting
pesos, Schwebel said.
</P>
<P>
   Just days away from what could potentially be a history-making
change in government, Mexico's political climate is much calmer
than in 1994, so investments have not stalled, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, fear over a new floating peso, unrest in Chiapas and
loans that listed interest payments in dollars undermined investor
confidence, said James Giermanski, former regents professor at
Texas A&AMP;M International University.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Mexican businesses and consumers have acclimated to
a floating peso that periodically adjusts downward. The peso fell
in gradual bumps of 10 percent to 15 percent each year between 1996
and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This time, political change is being welcomed. The presidential
election pits Francisco Labastida of the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) against Vicente Fox of the National
Action Party. Polls show that Fox has a strong change of ending 70
years of dominance by the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think change is good,'' said Daniel B. Hastings Jr.,
third-generation owner of a biggest Texas-based customs brokerage
house in Laredo. ``We may need one more PRI term to strengthen
state and local administrations, but Vicente Fox is very pro-trade
and export-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who holds a Harvard business degree and who has led
Coca-Cola operations in Mexico and Central America, ``has a good
business sense that not everybody has had before,'' Hastings said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the peso will probably make its familiar 5 percent to
10 percent drop and settle at about 10.25 to 10.5 for every dollar,
Schwebel said.
</P>
<P>
   If the markets react as they did after the last presidential
election, 2001 will be the year to watch. Even if the 2001 dip is
more substantial, ``it shouldn't hit us that hard because many
export businesses tie their contracts and leases firmly to the
dollar,'' said Nicholas Ferrara, president of Nuevo Laredo's
Industrial Development Committee.

&HT;     LEARNING TO BE A SURVIVOR ON CUBICLE ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ All right, so watching people eat raw bugs and
barbecued rats may not meet your definition of entertainment. It
doesn't matter. You still have to watch ``Survivor'' on CBS. It's
the most educational workplace-related television show since
``Roller Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   Think of it this way: Fifteen people are pushing themselves to
the limits of human endurance for mere peanuts, just so that one
greedy soul can walk away a millionaire. Now does it remind you of
work?
</P>
<P>
   In case you've been lost on a cubicle farm the last few weeks,
``Survivor'' is the hot show about being stranded on a deserted
island. Sixteen real people signed up for the 39-day ordeal on
Pulau Tiga in the South China Sea, and one of them gets voted off
the island every episode. The one who remains at the end of the
series wins $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you consider ``Survivor'' honest entertainment or
made-for-TV drivel doesn't really matter. It will teach you about
people, office politics and working relationships, crucial lessons
if you want to be a workplace manager or a survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few things to chew on:
</P>
<P>
   _ The inmates do run the asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is officially the leader of either ``Survivor'' tribe,
but people with certain skills have tried to appoint themselves as
bosses. Sometimes it backfires.
</P>
<P>
   B.B. Andersen, a 64-year-old retired contractor, found the
watering hole for his tribe and built its shelter. He also built up
a lot of resentment. ``I've been working my ass off,'' he told his
teammates, ``while a lot of you've been lying on your asses
watching me.''
</P>
<P>
   His leadership didn't last long. He was the first person voted
out of his tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly companies do appoint leaders. But if you are a
manager, ask yourself a question: How long would you last before
being voted off your tribe? If you don't like your answer, having
all the authority in the world won't help.
</P>
<P>
   Every good worker has certain skills. One of the most crucial
skills a manager can have is the ability to bring out the best in
other people. Setting a good example is important, but you also
have to realize that not everyone will approach work the way you
do. Others have to succeed on their own terms.
</P>
<P>
   The most important workplace skill was, is and always will be
the ability to get along with people. If you don't have that skill,
any success you have will be only temporary.
</P>
<P>
   _ Diversity is crucial, except when it's not.
</P>
<P>
   Different contests in ``Survivor'' reward different skills, so
sometimes the wispiest woman is more valuable than the most
muscular man. If you picked a team in your own image, you would
probably be in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Managers often pick people like themselves: same age, same sex,
same background, same skin color. You have things in common, and
that can make for a comfortable workplace. But it can also limit
creativity, because people with different backgrounds will approach
situations in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, diversity isn't always the answer. The first
person voted off the island was Sonja Christopher, 63. The others
in her tribe felt that although she might add wisdom and a good
perspective, she could drag the team down in physical contests.
</P>
<P>
   If you bring diversity to a group, you have to make it clear how
that will help, such as by using an unusual approach or attracting
new clients. If you lack some fundamental talent and you can't make
others understand how your diversity makes up for it, you won't
survive.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you teach a man to fish, he won't have to eat barbecued
rats.
</P>
<P>
   One tribe earned a snorkel and spear, helping its members to
catch a few fish. Meanwhile, the other tribe got its protein by
eating barbecued rats.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing how productive workers can be if you provide them
with the right tools. If you don't, they'll swallow something less
appealing, but that doesn't mean they'll enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   If a competitor is offering fish and you're offering barbecued
rats, your employees may do a little island-hopping.
</P>
<P>
   _ Denial even flows through the island.
</P>
<P>
   The third ousted castaway was Stacey Stillman, a lawyer who was
up a creek without a paddle when she unsuccessfully tried to oust
another tribe member: Rudy Boesch, a retired Navy Seal.
</P>
<P>
   Stillman may be a wonderful attorney, but she made a classic
employee mistake: overestimating your own value. If you're going to
raise a divisive issue, you run the risk of doing irreparable harm
to your reputation unless you already command respect.
</P>
<P>
   Even after being ousted, Stillman was pleading her case to the
camera, saying that the tribe had gotten rid of its ``bug-eating
hero.'' In the previous episode, tribe members from both sides had
to eat bugs or lose a contest, then a tiebreaker was held, where
the most squeamish person from each tribe had to eat two bugs as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Stillman did win that contest, but basically all that did
was save her. If she hadn't been her tribe's most squeamish link,
she wouldn't have been in the tiebreaker in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   She said the men basically just all stuck together behind
Boesch. ``I was more productive than the four guys,'' she
harrumphed. Yet even her two female tribe-mates weren't solidly
behind her; one voted to oust Boesch, the other Stillman.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Stillman was lucky. Circumstances gave her a lesson
that some workers never learn: Office politics are always part of
the game, even when you don't have an office.

<P>
   It's only a few day until the Fourth of July, the first real
opportunity for most of us to go on an actual picnic. It will be
our initial chance to get a true sunburn. Once more, we'll feel
that little sting of sparkler embers cascading down our bare arms.
</P>
<P>
   And we'll eat potato salad.
</P>
<P>
   We always eat potato salad on picnic holidays. No one seems to
know why, exactly. It's just that you bring green-bean casseroles
to inside, sit-down suppers; you bring potato salad to picnics.
</P>
<P>
   It is a rule, especially on Independence Day. It must have been
one of the things our forefathers fought for.
</P>
<P>
   The potato salad can be made with mustard or mayonnaise, or
both. Generally, if there are a lot of kids at the picnic, German
potato salad doesn't work well. It's too sweet/sour, and it doesn't
have the right kind of mushy texture that kids enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can overdo the mush. Since most kids now get
their potato salad from the supermarket deli counters, they are
used to the neatly squared little chunks of potato. They don't like
the mashed kind that some home cooks prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Just how potato salad first came about seems a mystery to me. No
one could accidentally drop some hard-boiled eggs and cooked
potatoes into a vat of mayonnaise and sweet pickles. Those items
don't generally sit together on the shelf. Someone had to unify
them on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   I did find a lengthy history of the french fry on the internet,
but it doesn't speak to potato salad. It does say that potatoes
were discovered by the Incas in South America.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no discussion of potato salad, the story goes
on to say the Incas used potatoes for ``telling time, treating
illness and injury, and divination.''
</P>
<P>
   They used spuds to foretell the future.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish found out about the potatoes and the English got
them from the Spanish, then the English gave them to the colonists
in America. It was unclear how the potatoes got over to Ireland, or
why the Germans make their potato salad with so much vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Texas, where the University of Texas Institute of Texan
Cultures says that Texans of German descent comprise the state's
fourth-largest ethnic group, we get a lot of tangy potato salad.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't a lot of variations on the basic potato salad
recipe. There are potatoes _ either white or red _ eggs, sometimes
celery or celery seed, and mustard and mayonnaise. If you want to
get real fancy, it is acceptable to toss in a handful of chopped
dill.
</P>
<P>
   It is also allowable to mix in chopped pickles or even pickle
relish.
</P>
<P>
   The strict recipes are generally easy to follow, but provide
kind of a boring product. Potato salad needs a little spicing up,
it seems, and no one spices up better than Paul Prudhomme,
</P>
<P>
   In his ``Chef Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen'' (Morrow,
$19.95), he offers potato salad with a twist. Instead of regular
mayo, Prudhomme suggests a green-onion salad dressing that is
different and full of flavor. With all the bottled salad dressings
on the market today, the idea of using different-flavored dressings
opens up a whole new opportunity for potato salad. I can see it
made with ranch, creamy garlic or Parmesan.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one caveat: Prudhomme's recipe is pretty spicy,
with two teaspoons of cayenne. Just to be safe, the first time out,
cut the cayenne in half.
</P>

SUPREME COURT DECISION PERMITS ELIAN GONZALEZ TO RETURN TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 3rd graf and adds new grafs 4-11 to update and add comments
by Clinton, Reno and lawyer for Elian's father.) 
 (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to issue an order to keep
Elian Gonzalez in the United States, clearing the way for the
6-year-old boy to return home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court order prohibiting the boy from leaving will
expire at 4 p.m. Wednesday, allowing Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, to take his son home. A chartered plane was waiting at
Dulles International Airport in Washington to carry Elian and his
family and friends back to Cuba. Federal marshals will escort the
boy from a suburban Washington home to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse order released just after noon EDT, the Supreme Court
refused to extend an appeals court order to keep Elian in the
United States and said that it would not review his case. The boy's
Miami relatives had filed suit to win an asylum hearing for the
boy, but lower courts had declined to overturn the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's refusal to allow the boy to stay in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, President Bill Clinton
said he was pleased the court had up held his administration's
decision to allow Elian to return home with his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez. Clinton said that he believed Juan Miguel Gonzalez was a
good parent, who deserved custody of his son. But Clinton added
that he was saddened by the demonstrations and protracted legal
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We upheld what I think is a important principle,'' Clinton
said. ``Do I wish it unfolded in a less dramatic, less traumatic
way? Of course I do.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling, Gregory Craig, the attorney for Elian's
father, said in a statement that his client had begun making
preparations to return home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal battle is over,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, a couple of dozen protesters gathered around the home
of the boy's Miami relatives. The home has been the focus of
protests against the U.S. government's efforts to return the boy to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, Cuban television reported the court's decision but
asked residents to remain calm, and not demonstrate publicly.
</P>
<P>
   A flight from Washington to Havana should take about
two-and-a-quarter hours, according to the Federal Aviation
Administration. If Elian leaves soon after the the expiration of
the court order, he would be in Cuba Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said in a brief statement that she
was pleased that the Supreme Court had declined to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This little boy now knows that he can remain with his
father,'' Reno said. `` I hope that everyone will accept the
Supreme Court's decision and join me in wishing this family and
this special little boy well.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued at sea on Nov. 25, three days after the boy,
his mother and 12 others left Cuba for Florida in a small motor
boat. Elian and two adults were saved after the boat capsized, but
the boy's mother, Elisabet, and 10 others died.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, was given
temporary custody of the boy and moved him into his Little Havana
home. But Elian's father requested that his son be returned to him,
touching off the battle for custody of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Elian quickly became the focus of demonstrations on both sides
of the Florida Straits. In Cuba, President Fidel Castro stirred up
demonstrations to demand that Elian be returned to his father, who
quickly became a symbol of loyalty to the communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Cuban-Americans had rallied to keep the boy in the
country, arguing that his mother had given her life so her son
could grow up in freedom. Others in Miami attached religious
significance to Elian's migration to Florida, saying that the
intercession of the Virgin Mary had saved the boy and that it would
be a violation of God's will to return the boy to a totalitarian
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Custody of the boy also became a political issue. Although a
majority of Americans supported returning the boy to his father,
Florida may be a key state in the fall presidential election and
the Cuban-American community is a potent voting bloc in Florida.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In January, the Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled
that Elian belonged with his father and should be returned to Cuba,
denying a request by Lazaro Gonzalez that the boy be granted an
asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But Elian's great uncle filed a federal lawsuit to overturn the
decision of the Immigration Service. As the court fight dragged on,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez traveled from Havana to Washington on April 6
with his new wife and their son to take custody of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives, however, balked at giving up the boy,
even after his father agreed that he would not leave the country
until the court case was resolved. When the Miami relatives ignored
an order from Attorney General Janet Reno to give up the boy, Reno
ordered a raid on the Miami home by armed federal officers.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has remained in the Washington area since he was taken
from Miami as the case made its way through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld the denial of the amnesty hearing, but ordered the boy to
remain in the country as the relatives filed an appeal with the
full Court of Appeals. That appeal was also denied on June 23, and
the Miami relatives were given just five days to win an emergency
stay from the Supreme Court.

&HT;     VACATION WITHOUT A CAMERA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ We started almost reverently, carefully
negotiating which family photograph should go to which brother or
sister. But four days into cleaning out our parents' house, my
brother Jamie was passing out old family photographs like a
blackjack dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Papa with a fish,'' Jamie said, tossing a picture of our
grandfather holding a salmon onto my sister Pam's pile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Papa with two fish, Papa with a string of fish, Papa in a
boat,'' he said as he dealt more photographs to the three of us.
</P>
<P>
   If there was one thing my grandfather Cooper loved, it was
fishing. If there was one thing my entire family loved, it was
taking pictures of each other. My late mother kept every one of
those pictures, and as an only child and blond beauty of the Ingrid
Bergman type, she was in a good many of them.
</P>
<P>
   My parents' old house on Cape Cod was filled with hundreds of
photographs, dating back to tintypes of relatives who fought in the
Civil War, all covered with dust that seemingly dated back to when
the house was built in 1776. George Washington coughed here.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother Morse was quite the young Victorian in her
graduation photo from Boston's Franklin Grammar School in 1900.
There were quite a few African-American girls in her class. Boston
schools were better integrated then than in my day. That's the kind
of thing you learn from old photographs.
</P>
<P>
   I learned from my father that his mother got to Boston because
her mother was a daring woman who amicably deserted her husband in
Maine and, after a time, sent for her children.
</P>
<P>
   My brother learned he's half Catholic on both sides, leading to
half-hearted jokes about going to confession and telling half-lies.
He never knew that grandfather Morse was an Irish Catholic who
renounced his religion before marrying a Yankee, or that
grandmother Cooper grew up in a Catholic orphanage in England.
</P>
<P>
   We found an old box containing the rosaries she brought to this
country on the Aquitania. I told the story my mother told me, about
how her mother became an Anglican because Catholic churches in New
Bedford divided up by ethnicity, with none for the English.
</P>
<P>
   American family histories are so complicated compared to the
myths of melting pot or multiculturalism. My mother is gone, and
she was the family historian. We never thought to get the full
briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing you learn: Every house is a dump, a memory dump,
but it has to be cleaned out sooner or later. It's always later,
and the pictures never have names on the back.
</P>
<P>
   As the first born in my generation, there were hundreds of
photos of me in my first few years. I tried to explain to my sister
and brother that mom and dad had run out of film by the time they
were born. They were a little hurt anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I was the favored child, as my brother and sister always
claimed. Unfortunately, it means I had all the more photos to ship
to California.
</P>
<P>
   Once the six boxes of photographs and papers arrive by UPS, I'm
cleaning out my house. I'm not leaving the kind of archaeological
dig my folks did. I don't even have room for my measly old photos,
and now I have boxes of theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The days of being able to afford a house big enough to hold a
family's precious junk are gone. But we can't throw out the
photographs of our great-grandparents' fish-and-chips shop in
Manchester, our grandfather Cooper's working papers that allowed
him to labor as a child in an English mill, or the ships' logs and
portraits from the faintly respectable Maine side of the family.
</P>
<P>
   We await the arrival of my mother's capacious old bureau after
her house sells, and Lord knows where the bureau will go.
</P>
<P>
   We buried my mother at sea after a week of sorting the
photographs and papers she had saved. My father chartered a boat,
and on a bright morning in a gray week we slipped the paper
container of her ashes and some flowers from her garden onto the
unusually glassy waters of Vineyard Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Her father had pulled plenty of flatfish and stripers out of
those waters, and some may not even be in photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Past Woods Hole we could see as far as New Bedford and Fall
River, where my mother lived as a child. In the other direction was
Chatham, where she once had a house and a garden she loved, and
turning north around the Cape you could sail to Maine, where she
went to high school and fell in love with my father.
</P>
<P>
   On the Cape shore near Nobska Light were fancy homes she had
sold as a real estate agent. Sailing out of Woods Hole was the
Martha's Vineyard ferry we took so often to the island Bill Clinton
has helped ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago, our family's little boat had been passed by President
John F. Kennedy in the Honey Fitz near the spot we placed my
mother's ashes. The late president's late son, a favorite of my
discerning mother, was buried at sea just a couple of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   This was navigation from the heart by my father the former naval
officer. He didn't realize the full significance of the spot until
we were there, looking past the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution, where he had worked, toward New Bedford, where two
young immigrants met long ago, got married and had a special
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   My mother might have liked this, even though she was as far from
a sentimentalist as a person can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just cremate me, and throw me away,'' were the burial
instructions of this hard-working New England lady. We didn't
follow her instructions exactly.
</P>
<P>
   We each said a few things. We floated her on the water. We
didn't find that famous thing called closure, but we opened to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't take a camera.

&HT;     FOR GORE IT'S THE BEST OF TIMES, THE WORST OF TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, July 2   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Al Gore _ as for the heroic Sidney Carton and
his friends in Charles Dickens' ``A Tale of Two Cities,'' this is
the best of times and the worst of times.
</P>
<P>
   It is the best of times because two months from now Gore will be
anointed as the Democratic Party's first presidential nominee of
the new millennium. He will be the warrior who will carry the
banner once hoisted aloft by such Democratic presidents and
presidential candidates as Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson,
Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy,
Lyndon Johnson, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Adlai Stevenson and
Hubert Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   He also will be the candidate of the party that can point with
great satisfaction to the facts that the horrendous federal deficit
ended during its watch and that Bill Clinton will be leaving office
with a budget surplus now estimated a $1.9 trillion over the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   It is the worst of times because Gore has been steadily sinking
behind his Republican rival, George W. Bush in the opinion polls
and because Bush has taken the initiative on key issues _ such as
Social Security, Medicare and education _ that once provided
formidable campaign weapons for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the vice president faces the possibility that his
veracity will be eroded if investigators probing his 1996
fund-raising activities find that he was deceptive in order to hide
the true nature of those activities. At issue is his claim that he
did not know that his appearance at the Hsi Lai Buddhist temple
near Los Angeles was a fund-raising event that added an estimated
$140,000 to Democratic coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Also at issue is the question of whether he understood that some
of the campaign contributions he solicited by telephone in 1996
were ``hard money'' that would benefit his and Clinton's campaign
and not just ``soft money'' for the party.
</P>
<P>
   When Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., revealed that Robert J. Conrad
Jr., a top Justice Department investigator, had urged Attorney
General Janet Reno to name a special prosecutor to probe Gore's
fund-raising activities more fully, the vice president replied
heatedly and hastily.
</P>
<P>
   He released a 123-page transcript of the four-hour interview
that he had on April 18 with federal investigators on those very
issues. Gore's answers to questions posed in that interview form
the basis for Conrad's call for the appointment of a special
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore told reporters, ``I think the truth is my friend in
this,'' and he added that they could read the transcript and
``judge it for yourselves.'' He asserted that he ``sure as hell''
did not know that the Buddhist temple event was a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Bush apparently already had made a judgment about Gore's
honesty. He chortled when he declared that the demand for a further
investigation of Gore reinforces his own call for ``a new tone in
Washington, which is going to require a new administration.'' That,
the Texas governor added, means turning back Gore's quest for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial question, however, is not what Gore knew when
visited the Buddhist temple or when he made telephone calls to
raise campaign funds. The question is: Did he tell the truth about
his role in those activities.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is suffering from his close relationship with Clinton who
lied under oath about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. No
matter where he goes or what he does, Gore is haunted by the
Clinton stigma at the same time that he is helped by Clinton's
record of achievement and Clinton's continued popularity.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton connection is important to Gore when he cites the
economic gains made by Americans. His ties to the president also
are helpful in his bid for votes among African Americans, Hispanics
and union members. But the ties tarnish Gore's image when his
truthfulness is said to parallel that of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Reno will not bow to Republican pressure and
name a special counsel to probe Gore's conduct. Following an
earlier look into his fund-raising activities four years ago, Reno
rejected suggestions then that she appoint a special counsel to
investigate him. She is a strong woman, who does not readily take
actions that contradict her earlier decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Several individuals and newspapers have suggested that the
voters, rather than a special counsel, should make the decision on
Gore's credibility. By Election Day, Bush and his GOP surrogates
will have filled the atmosphere with charges that Gore cannot be
trusted. At the same time, Gore and his Democratic backers will
have asserted over and over that the vice president's behavior is
above suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Debate over Gore's honesty during the presidential campaign
should provide voters with enough information to determine whether
the vice president is, or is not, the right man to move into the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is not without his problems. They include his seeming
indifference to the death penalty in Texas, where 135 people have
been put to death during his governorship. The problems also
include the possibility that some of oil barons who have done
business with Bush and who have supported his political ambitions
could be found guilty of jacking up the price of gasoline in this
election year.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Bush was late in proposing campaign fund-raising
reform. Under pressure from Arizona Senator John McCain during the
primaries, he unveiled a plan that would place a lid on
contributions from corporations and labor unions but would allow
wealthy individuals, a majority of whom are Republicans, to spend
as much as they desired on political campaigns. His proposed
reform, therefore, would weaken the Democrats while strengthening
the Republicans.

   CIR-WEB-SEARCH (Undated) _ Five years ago, search engines seemed
like the Web's salvation. Today, they need some saviors of their
own. When search engines first appeared, they were hailed for
accomplishing two things that could not possibly be done by people
on any large scale: search engines could find and index Web sites
almost as soon as they appeared. And they could almost
instantaneously match a page with a single keyword. But today, the
promise of automation has been tempered by the Web's success. There
are now more than one billion Web pages, and doubling every eight
months. Keeping up with that growth has been nearly impossible. To
cope, many search engines have concluded that simply indexing more
pages is not the answer. Instead, they have decided to rely on the
one resource that was once considered a cop-out: human judgment.
Search engines have become more like cyborgs, part human, part
machine. By Lisa Guernsey.

   CIR-CHINA-GAMES (Beijing) _ Three a.m. on a summer Friday in
Beijing. A smoke-filled room is packed with men, faces lighted by
computer monitors, adrenaline running from online combat. Bicycles
clutter the alley outside the door under the sign that reads NG
Cafe. The men are muttering into their headsets, discussing attack
strategies with teammates seated only a few computers away. NG Cafe
is a net cafe or a wangba, which serve as late-night entertainment
venues for hundreds of Beijing residents. The putative reason the
wangbas operate is to provide online access. But the global scope
of the Internet seemed mostly an afterthought in a room where 18 of
the 20 computers are engaged in electronic warfare with opponents
sitting nearby. The fact that the government considers the playing
of computer games in wangbas illegal has not stopped thousands of
them, and their cousins, game parlors, (which typically do not
provide Internet access, just locally networked computers) from
springing up across China. But the proliferation of wangbas and
game parlors in the last three years has vexed a government that
aspires to monitor social, political and economic trends. Wangbas,
the government believes, have the potential to alter all three. By
Jennifer 8. Lee.

   SEA-SHELLS (New York) _ The lowly mollusk should rightly be

today are sometimes prized and polished, and sometimes trampled
underfoot. Christopher Gow, importer, creator of objets, and
consummate handyman, would probably live in a sea shell if he could
figure out how. A longtime fan and student of whelks, conchs,
periwinkles, murexes, et al, he is also the founder of Ruzzetti &AMP;
Gow, a Manhattan-based company that gathers shells around the
world, silver-coats them in Rome, and uses them to adorn antique
and contemporary frames, chandeliers and mirrors. He sells sea

   WEST-PALM-LIVING (West Palm Beach, Fla.) _ ``The best thing
about this neighborhood is you can step outside to get the paper
and not see anybody you know,'' said Mario Nievera. Which can be a
blessing, he added, ``because we live pretty public lives here.''
Here is Palm Beach, a posh playground for Vanderbilts, Astors and
their ilk since the 1920s, and Nievera is not being boastful about
the high-profile existence shared by him and his partner, Robert
Janjigian. A gregarious, notebook-wielding presence at cocktail
parties and charity events, Janjigian, 42, is the fashion editor of
the Palm Beach Daily News, known as The Shiny Sheet for the paper's
slick finish. The gardens that Nievera, 35, creates for members of
the local fete set show up in Architectural Digest. Yet their
primary residence is comfortably modest. So is its location.

   HARDY-PLANTS (Undated) One morning in early June, Dr. Peter del
Tredici led the way around the Arnold Arboretum at Harvard to some
of the beautiful old plants he says are tough enough to ride the
roller coaster of recent climate changes. Among them is the Chinese
fringe tree (Chionanthus retusas), with its masses of little white
blossoms covering its broad branches like a silken shawl. The
fragrance was so intoxicating I wanted to open my arms and walk
right into it. The arboretum, founded in 1872 and designed by
Frederick Law Olmsted, rambles for 265 acres over the hills of
Jamaica Plain, Mass. As plant explorers continue to add to the
collection of 7,000 woody plants, it stands as a vast repository of
the temperate world's hardiest specimens. It's Del Tredici's living
laboratory, where he observes, almost daily, which plants survive

 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ His marriage and military career both over, Mark
Poehlman was trolling the Internet for someone to share his
passions for cross-dressing and foot fetishism. He answered an ad
placed by ``Sharon,'' who expressed interest but said she was
really seeking a ``special teacher'' for her three young daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The more that Poehlman wooed Sharon by e-mail, the more she
brought up her daughters, saying she preferred to watch. After two
weeks, he took the hint, sent a series of messages about sex with
the children, and finally traveled from his Florida home to Long
Beach, Calif., where Sharon showed him some child pornography and
then delivered him into the waiting arms of state and federal
agents.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that
Poehlman, 40, had been entrapped, and overturned his 10-year
federal prison sentence for crossing state lines to engage in sex
with a minor. He had served about 19 months of the sentence, and
previously served part of a one-year state prison term for the same
conduct, a conviction not affected by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-1 decision, the court said federal agents conceived of
the crime and recruited Poehlman, who was looking only for legal,
adult companionship.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is surely enough real crime in our society that it is
unnecessary for our law enforcement officials to spend months
luring an obviously lonely and confused individual to cross the
line between fantasy and criminality,'' said the opinion by
appellate Judge Alex Kozinski.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting Judge David Thompson said there was enough evidence
to support the jury's conclusion that Poehlman was the one who
proposed sex with the children.
</P>
<P>
   Entrapment has become a common defense to the increasing number
of sex crime prosecutions resulting from government sting
operations on the Internet, where agents typically pose as
children.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants have to prove that they were induced to commit the
crime. But in cases like Poehlman's, the government has argued,
usually with success, that the defendant was already predisposed to
commit the crime and was merely given an opportunity by an
undercover agent. Defendants have a better chance in California
courts, which consider predisposition irrelevant and define
entrapment as police conduct that would induce a normally
law-abiding person to break the law.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Lon Ramlan, who investigates cyber crimes for the San
Francisco police, said undercover officers are careful to avoid
entrapment but are encountering new definitions in the Internet
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is public and anonymous,'' he said. ``I don't
have to announce I'm a police officer. But it's a very complicated
area. When you develop these relationships on the Internet, logging
all the conversations, it's very difficult at times to know how far
you should or shouldn't go.''
</P>
<P>
   Poehlman's lawyer, Edward M. Robinson, said there was no
evidence that Poehlman was predisposed to have sex with children.
He said the ``alternative lifestyle'' Internet discussion group,
which Poehlman was frequenting when he saw ``Sharon's'' ad, focused
on sexual behavior among adults, not children.
</P>
<P>
   Posting that ad reflected a misplaced belief by federal law
enforcement authorities ``that people who are not just straight
heterosexuals are automatically interested in children,'' Robinson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles was disappointed by
the ruling, said spokeswoman Adriene Hill.
</P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The case dates from 1995, when Poehlman had just been divorced
by his wife after about 12 years of marriage and had been pushed
into early retirement after nearly 17 years in the Air Force. Both
separations resulted from his inability to control his impulse to
cross-dress, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   In her first e-mail, Sharon told Poehlman that she and her
children were ``looking for someone who understands us and does not
let society's views stand in the way.'' She said she especially
wanted someone to help with the children's ``special education,''
and referred in later messages to a ``man teacher'' and ``special
teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Poehlman replied that he would be happy to teach the children
``proper morals'' but said he was interested in a relationship,
leading to marriage, with Sharon. She turned him down; said she
wanted only someone for her daughters, and described having ``goose
bumps'' when recalling her own ``special teacher.'' She also asked
him to describe plans for their ``first lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   She never mentioned child sex, but her meaning was clear, the
court said: Poehlman could stay in contact with her only if he
agreed to have sex with her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government . . . played on Poehlman's obvious need for an
adult relationship, for acceptance of his sexual proclivities and
for a family, to draw him ever deeper into a sexual fantasy
world,'' wrote Kozinski, joined by Judge Betty Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   In dissent, Thompson said the government's messages were
``purposely vague'' and gave Poehlman the chance to back out if he
wanted only an adult relationship.

AND NOW, FOR $500, CAESAR WILL EAT A POISON-IVY SALAD

<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm probably a little too young to begin grumbling wth any real
authority about the world going to hell in a handbasket, but I
swear I'm getting pretty steady whiffs of singed wicker these days.
Some mornings after I read the paper, I just want to stay home in
my slippers and bathrobe and grouse to the cat about how much more
sensible people used to be.
</P>
<P>
   It's gotten so bad I've actually begun reflecting on the roughly
eight years of first-year Latin I took in high school and college
to try to recall what comparable stage of the decline and fall of
the Roman Empire we're now living through.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm not remembering it clearly, but didn't folks entertain
themselves back then by watching people nibble on rat hors
d'oeuvres, like we're now doing with the insanely popular game show
``Survivor''?
</P>
<P>
   Didn't the Roman senators do stuff like eliminate taxes that
affected only the nation's wealthiest citizens, while fiddling
endlessly over how to help the elderly pay for the medicine they
need to stay alive?
</P>
<P>
   Weren't there a couple of ambitious praetors named Jebbus and
Georgius Dubyus who duked it out over who could send more people
down the River Styx? At one point, didn't an inexplicably
influential windbag like Rush Limbaugh audition for ``Monday Night
Gladiators''?
</P>
<P>
   If I can find a company that manufactures togas, I think I'll
invest. The way things are going, it'll be the next big fashion
trend.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I read a story in The Village Voice about young
entrepreneurs creating ``reality-based'' shows on the Internet. One
site features a game show called ``I Bet You Will.'' People are
given wads of cash to perform degrading stunts.
</P>
<P>
   The show's host, Morgan Spurlock, led a camera crew into
Manhattan recently. He had a very busy day, it appears. A fellow
ate a whole jar of mayonnaise for 50 bucks. Another guy gnawed on
dog feces for $400. Two women accepted $200 each to walk around
town topless, with bull's-eyes on their breasts and the words
``Follow Me 2 Free Money,'' scrawled on their backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not exploiting people,'' Spurlock told The Village
Voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving them an experience that they will joke about with
their friends for the rest of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Yuh. I can imagine regaling friends years from now with tales of
the time I ate doggie doo to pay off my Mastercard. Ooh, the
memories. Another Internet site offers ``Dare for Dollars,'' which
asks ``desperate people'' to send them details of degrading things
they'd do for cash. The ``winners'' get filmed in action.
</P>
<P>
   Some entries would cause Caligula to flinch. A college student
who says his parents have cut him off financially -- and no wonder
-- offers to lick a public urinal for $2,000. Another fellow, who
describes himself as an unemployed diabetic with no health
insurance, offered to run barefoot across a greased basketball
court while people throw oranges at him. His asking price: $3,750.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone likes this abusive form of ``charity.'' At the
filming of ``I Bet You Will,'' bystanders began hollering at the
camera crew to stop. ``Welcome, welcome, welcome to the Roman
festivities,'' one guy shouted. ``Decadence! Decadence!'' Someone
promptly spit on him.
</P>
<P>
   Stuff like this has been going on for centuries, of course. We
just have more ways to beam the frivolity around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect there's a correlation, though, between our booming
economy and the popularity of these programs. So many people are
getting stinking rich for doing little or nothing, and it's
frustrating some folks so much that they're willing to go to
extremes to get a piece of the action.
</P>
<P>
   And then, blessedly, there's Anne Lydiat of Nottingham, England,
who's enjoying modest success with her new book, ``At a Loss for
Words.'' It's 52 pages long, and each and every page is blank. She
says she was inspired to ``write'' it after visiting several
Belgian convents where talking is forbidden. ``I wanted a book that
dealt with silent spaces,'' she said. ``You open it and there's
nothing to read. But maybe nothing is something.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps I've inhaled too much handbasket smoke, but that halfway
makes sense. I look forward to seeing a game show based on her
book.
</P>

 &HT;    IBM LAUNCHES WORLD'S FASTEST SUPERCOMPUTER
 &HT;    With SUPERCOMPUTER-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ IBM announced Thursday(cq) it has built the first
supercomputer that scientists hope is powerful enough to simulate
the explosion of a nuclear weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The $110 million machine is a major step toward an era when
computers will provide such benefits as vastly improved weather
forecasts and individually designed medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The new IBM computer, called ASCI White, weighs 106 tons and
occupies an area the size of two NBA basketball courts. It would
take the next four biggest computers in the world combined to equal
its enormous processing power.
</P>
<P>
   The new supercomputer can do 12.3 trillion calculations a
second, making it about 30,000 times more powerful than today's
desktop personal computers. It is 1,000 times more powerful than
IBM's Deep Blue, the supercomputer that beat chess champion Garry
Kasparov in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every man, woman and child on the face of the Earth would have
to add up 2,000 random numbers a second to keep up with this
machine,'' said David Cooper, chief information officer at the
Energy Department's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said he was ``cautiously optimistic'' that ASCI White
will for the first time let government scientists perform the
complex mode actual underground tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a lot of the old-timers will say, 'I'm not willing to give
up on testing until I see a lot more of these simulations,' ``
Cooper noted in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, using a model that makes 1 trillion calculations a
second, the Livermore lab was able to test nuclear weapon
``triggers.'' Combining those tests with ASCI White testing of
explosive yields would require 20 or 30 days of work on a computer
that makes 100 trillion calculations a second, Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has entered into ``discussions'' with the Energy
Department's office of defense programs to deliver just such a
machine by 2004, said Jim Jardine, IBM's Austin, Texas-based
project manager for ASCI White. The letters stand for the Energy
Department's ``accelerated strategic computing initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Livermore, nuclear simulation tests are also being
conducted at Los Alamos and the Sandia National Laboratories, both
in New Mexico. They are necessitated by the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, which the United States has not signed, but by which it
abides.
</P>
<P>
   IBM believes the supercomputing breakthrough can be applied to
other fields besides nuclear weapons. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Global weather modeling under which current 18-hour computing
cycles can be reduced to a few seconds, radically transforming
early warning systems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Production of pharmaceuticals that are custom-tailored to a
person's individual's genetic profile.
</P>
<P>
   _ Integrated monitoring of air routes, jet stream weather
patterns and pollution migration.
</P>
<P>
   The basic building block of the new IBM supercomputer is known
as the RS/6000. Since 1992, IBM has sold more than a million of
these machines to about 150,000 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Jardine noted that the ASCI White system rests on a structure
that combines many of these units, unlike ``the one-of-a-kind
(supercomputers) that not a lot of people can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in sheer scale, the new machine dwarfs all that has gone
before. For example, if it were to be deployed as a Web server, it
could process 6 billion online transactions in one minute flat.
</P>
<P>
   To get the job done:
</P>
<P>
   _ Its 8,192 microprocessors contain some 2,000 miles of copper
wiring.
</P>
<P>
   _ It holds than 160 trillion bytes of disk storage capacity,
enough to house twice the contents of the Library of Congress and
16,000 times more than high-end PC's equipped with 10 gigabytes of
storage capacity.
</P>
<P>
   _ It has a memory bank of 6.2 trillion bytes, nearly 100,000
times more than today's average desktop PC, which comes with 64
megabytes of memory.
</P>
<P>
   _ It requires 1.2 megawatts of electricity, enough to power a
small-sized city.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shipments of the machine from the IBM performance testing
facility in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., to Livermore, which have already
begun, is requiring 28 tractor trailer trucks.
</P>
<P>

supercomputers.

as the RS/6000. Since 1992, IBM has sold more than a million of
these machines to about 150,000 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Jardine noted that the ASCI White system rests on a structure
that combines many of these units, unlike ``the one-of-a-kind
(supercomputers) that not a lot of people can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in sheer scale, the new machine dwarfs all that has gone
before. For example, if it were to be deployed as a Web server, it
could process 6 billion online transactions in one minute flat.

   _ Its 8,192 microprocessors contain some 2,000 miles of copper
wiring.
</P>
<P>
   _ It holds than 160 trillion bytes of disk storage capacity,
enough to house twice the contents of the Library of Congress and
16,000 times more than high-end PC's equipped with 10 gigabytes of
storage capacity.
</P>
<P>
   _ It has a memory bank of 6.2 trillion bytes, nearly 100,000
times more than today's average desktop PC, which comes with 64
megabytes of memory.
</P>
<P>
   _ It requires 1.2 megawatts of electricity, enough to power a
small-sized city.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shipments of the machine from the IBM performance testing
facility in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., to Livermore, which have already
begun, is requiring 28 tractor trailer trucks.

INSTANT NOSTALGIA, AS TWO HAVENS FOR YOUNG WOMEN CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MONTE WILLIAMS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The young women will pine for the maid service and
the two meals a day, and some will even miss the fact that suitors
were not allowed in their rooms, only in the elegantly appointed
``beau parlors.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, in this market of cloud-scaling housing costs,
they will miss the rent: $600 to $700 a month, breakfast and dinner
and maid service included.
</P>
<P>
   On June 30, Katharine House and Roberts House _ Manhattan's last
two residential hotels for young women _ will be vacant, except for
staff members who have until July 14 to leave. The closing of the
residences will end an era when dozens of long-term hotels housed
dewy-eyed women from all over the world. The most famous was the
Barbizon Hotel for Women, which became a spa in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The young residents of these hotels were an ambitious lot:
Aspiring models, actresses, dancers, writers and students. They had
come to take on New York, hunting fame and fortune and, yes,
husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Not just anyone could stay at these residences. At Roberts
House, at 151 E. 36th St., and Katharine House, at 118 W. 13th St.,
the women had to be between 18 and 25 years old and could not earn
more than $25,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great entree into the city,'' said George Liu, one of
the 25 to 30 young women at Roberts House who were still looking
for new places to live last week. ``It's a great place to start.
We've made great friends.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Liu found a room on the Upper West Side. By Tuesday,
the 14 women remaining at Roberts House and the 13 at Katharine
House were packing, some of them to return home, others to stay
with friends.
</P>
<P>
   The two houses, each more than 70 years old and with 80 rooms,
are owned by the Ladies Christian Union, a nonprofit organization
founded before the Civil War. The organization has listed the
buildings with Sotheby's International Realty Co., which estimates
they will fetch just under $10 million each.
</P>
<P>
   Yeshiva University is seriously interested in Roberts House as a
women's dormitory, said Dolly Lenz, executive vice president of
Sotheby's. And Katharine House has caught the eye of a developer
who wants to turn it into a condominium.
</P>
<P>
   The Ladies Christian Union once ran six such residences for
women. ``Our goal is to promote the temporal, moral and religious
welfare of women _ particularly young women _ who are dependent
upon their own exertions for support,'' said Noelle Mills Adler,
the organization's president.
</P>
<P>
   That mission has not changed, Adler said, but the group's
methods will. ``We feel there are more effective ways of fulfilling
our purpose and reaching more needy young women by becoming a
grant-making organization,'' she said, adding that the group would
contribute to hardship cases at colleges, universities and
performing arts and vocational schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the young women who have yet to find a new place to live in
New York, or who have all but given up trying, are skeptical. ``I
think they're sort of selling out,'' said Bonnie Freestone, a
23-year-old teacher at a Roman Catholic high school on the Upper
East Side and a resident of Katharine House for more than a year.
``This is the last bit of affordable housing in the West Village,
and now it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Freestone, who plans to go to graduate school in New Jersey
after Katharine House closes, said that certain rules at the
residence were a bit anachronistic. For example, she laughed when
showing a visitor the beau parlor, a chintz-filled room with
flowers, and laughed again when asked if any men might have found
their way into the women's rooms without the knowledge of the
resident director, who functions in many ways like a dorm mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place isn't even in the 20th century,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But that Victorian ethos comforted the parents of the young
women from far-flung places who moved into the residences. At both
houses, visitors are not allowed above the first floor without
permission. At Katharine House receptionists buzz the young women
in their rooms _ twice for a guest and once for a phone call. (The
rooms at Roberts House have telephones.) At both buildings, the
rules required suitors to leave by 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1950s, there was even a curfew for residents: 11 p.m.
on weekdays, midnight on weekends. ``There was a Salvation Army
residence on 38th Street, and the girls who didn't meet the curfew
used to go around there and spend the night,'' Adler said. ``Well,
the Salvation Army complained so bitterly, we dropped the curfew.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Mae Crawford, a 21-year-old resident of Roberts House
and an aspiring artist, recalled that when her boyfriend came to
install a stereo system in her room, a chaperon came, too.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, a native of Lake Charles, La., recently found an
apartment in Queens to share with two other women. But the landlord
has not finished renovating the place, ``so for two months we will
be homeless,'' she said, glumly.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Dawe, a dancer, has been looking for rooms in other
long-term Manhattan hotels, a few of which started out as
residences for young women but have since opened their doors to men
and older women. Those moves changed the character of the
residences. But that is not her chief concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just don't seem to be as clean as this place,'' Dawe said
last week as she ate a chili sandwich in the dining room of Roberts
House. ``They just don't seem to be as nice, and they're more
expensive. Here there are no ants, no roaches, no rats.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff members have been looking for new jobs, and in some cases,
homes too. Alexandra Polychronopoulou, a residence co-director at
Roberts House for the last four years, said that she would have to
give up her own one-bedroom apartment there. Some days, she
recalled, she could hear the sound of music coming from the baby
grand piano in the living room whenever the women decided to throw
an impromptu concert. Her eyes sparkled at the memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``On many days, there were French girls eating in the garden,
just chirping away,'' she said. ``In the winter, the girls would
have hot chocolate, in their pajamas. And we would have the biggest
Christmas tree and menorah.''
</P>
<P>
   Few residents or employees have been feeling festive lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't reached the weeping stage yet,'' said Nikki Hinds,
25, a resident of Katharine House for a year and a half. ``But I've
heard lots of weeping.'' Hinds, a part-time research assistant who
has just completed a graduate program in public policy at New
School University, is searching for an apartment with a friend. So
far, they have come up empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Both buildings had been fully occupied until it was announced
six months ago that they were being sold. ``A lot of girls just
gave up and went back home,'' Hinds said.
</P>
<P>
   Dina Vickermann, a 21-year-old from Germany who came to study
acting at the Lee Strasberg Institute, said last week that she
would return to Germany to study medicine. ``I'd like to try
acting, but I need something where I can support myself,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   And Becky Peterson, a 24-year-old editorial assistant at a
publishing company, plans to leave Manhattan and live with
relatives in the San Francisco Bay area after Katharine House
closes. She has dreams of being a writer. ``I can't afford to live
here anymore,'' she said. ``If I can't live in Manhattan, then I
don't want to be here. Getting a share with someone in the outer
boroughs is not what I came here for.''

 &HT;    Imperfect `Storm' logs great effects but so-so plot
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There could have been a tragic dimension to
``The Perfect Storm,'' the man-against-nature epic that leads to
needless fishing-community deaths. But the Wolfgang Petersen movie
based on Sebastian Junger's nonfiction bestseller is content to
reduce the sea saga to a water-park thrill ride.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you like raging ocean foam, torrential rains and surging
walls of water, you will probably note the imperfections in
Petersen's ``Storm.'' If you prefer flesh-and-blood to H2O, you are
really in for a disappointing voyage, for the crew of the
commercial fishing boat Andrea Gail is made up of hollow, stock
characters whose actions keep defying rational thought.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they are no worse than the tornado-trackers who
headed toward _ not away from _ the deadly funnel of ``Twister,'' a
movie that shares special-effects supervisor John Frazier with
``The Perfect Storm.'' They at least were compelled to record data
for scientific study.
</P>
<P>
   Here, once Capt. Billy Tyne (George Clooney) hauls in a
lucrative catch of swordfish, and his boat's ice machine happens to
stop functioning, he heads directly into the path of three
converging weather fronts. It is a foolhardy decision made for
mercenary motives, hardly a move calculated to involve an audience
in the crew's waterlogged struggle for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Petersen and screenwriter Bill Witliff (''Lonesome
Dove'') want us to care about these folks. After all, they spend
the first half-hour of ``The Perfect Storm `` sketching them in as
they get sloshed and pour out their pipe dreams to one another at
Gloucester's nautical hangout, the Crow's Nest.
</P>
<P>
   There is Tyne, whose streak of bad luck at sea is preying on his
sense of judgment and will lead him to take out the Andrea Gail
again on the cusp of the risky fall weather season. There is Bobby
Shatford (Mark Wahlberg), strapped for cash since his divorce and
eager to start a new life with steamy Chris Cotter (Diane Lane),
whom he promises _ Cliche warning! Cliche warning! _ that this will
be his last trip to sea. Dale Murphy (John C. Reilly) also has
money woes over his estranged family; scruffy Bugsy (John Hawkes)
cruises the bar for some human contact; and Jamaican Alfred Pierre
(Allen Payne) is ill-defined except for his extreme sexual prowess.
Add in last-minute crew replacement Sully (William Fitcher), a
sullen bloke whose sole purpose is extra dramatic friction, and we
are ready to hit the water.
</P>
<P>
   It is getting tiresome to report it, but ``The Perfect Storm''
is just one more big-budget movie that cares far more about its
visual effects than its story. Yes, the Industrial Light &AMP; Magic
computer-simulated squalls are impressive, and the towering waves
are awesome. Once the storm builds to full force, though, even the
shouted dialogue is difficult to understand.
</P>
<P>
   There are exciting rescue attempts by an Air Force helicopter,
but the evident peril to the military Samaritans underlines how
selfish the Gail's actions are. That also goes for a trio of yacht
cruisers (Bob Gunton, Cherry Jones and Karen Allen) whose purpose
must be to make the fishermen seem sane by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   When you consider that Petersen once made ``Das Boot'' (''The
Boat''), perhaps the most gripping nautical action picture ever,
his efforts this time seem perfunctory. James Horner's music
indicates that we are supposed to feel that the ship's crew is up
to something heroic and noble. Apparently, he was short on melodies
for the greedy and foolhardy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there were pithier messages intended for ``The Perfect
Storm,'' but they have been drowned out by the deluge. A movie like
this should leave us with a more profound moral than ``Check your
ice maker before heading out to fish,'' don't you think?

SUPREME COURT DECISION PERMITS ELIAN GONZALEZ TO RETURN TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS grafs 2,3 and adds news grafs 4-12 to update and include
comments by Clinton, Reno and lawyer for father's family.)  
(EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court Wednesday refused to issue an order to keep
Elian Gonzalez in the United States, clearing the way for the
6-year-old boy to return home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 3 p.m. EDT, federal marshals and police officers
escorted a white van carrying Elian, his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, and their family and friends from the Washington home
they had been staying in to Dulles International Airport, where two
chartered planes waited to take them to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse order released just after noon EDT, the Supreme Court
refused to extend an appeals court order keeping Elian in the
country and said that it would not review the case. The boy's Miami
relatives had filed suit to win an asylum hearing for the boy, but
lower courts had declined to overturn the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's refusal to allow the boy to stay in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Wednesday afternoon, President Clinton said
he was pleased the court had upheld his administration's decision
to allow Elian to return home with his father. He said that he
believed Juan Miguel Gonzalez was a good parent, who deserved
custody of his son. But Clinton added he was saddened by the
demonstrations and protracted legal fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We upheld what I think is a important principle,'' Clinton
said. ``Do I wish it unfolded in a less dramatic, less traumatic
way? Of course I do.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling, Gregory Craig, an attorney for Elian's father,
said in a statement that his client had begun making preparations
to return home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal battle is over,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, a couple of dozen protesters gathered around the home
of the boy's Miami relatives. The home has been the focus of
protests against the U.S. government's efforts to return the boy to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, Cuban television reported the court's decision but
asked residents to remain calm, and not demonstrate publicly.
</P>
<P>
   A flight from Washington to Havana should take about
two-and-a-quarter hours, according to the Federal Aviation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said in a brief statement that she
was pleased that the Supreme Court had declined to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This little boy now knows that he can remain with his
father,'' Reno said. `` I hope that everyone will accept the
Supreme Court's decision and join me in wishing this family and
this special little boy well.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued at sea on Nov. 25, three days after the boy,
his mother and 12 others left Cuba for Florida in a small motor
boat. Elian and two adults were saved after the boat capsized, but
the boy's mother, Elisabet, and 10 others died.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, was given
temporary custody of the boy and moved him into his Little Havana
home. But Elian's father requested that his son be returned to him,
touching off the battle for custody of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Elian quickly became the focus of demonstrations on both sides
of the Florida Straits. In Cuba, President Fidel Castro stirred up
demonstrations to demand that Elian be returned to his father, who
quickly became a symbol of loyalty to the communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Cuban-Americans rallied to keep the boy in the
country, arguing that his mother had given her life so her son
could grow up in freedom. Others in Miami attached religious
significance to Elian's migration to Florida, saying that the
intercession of the Virgin Mary had saved the boy and that it would
be a violation of God's will to return the boy to a totalitarian
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Custody of the boy also became a political issue. Although a
majority of Americans supported returning the boy to his father,
Florida may be a key state in the fall presidential election and
the Cuban-American community is a potent voting bloc in Florida.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In January, the Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled
that Elian belonged with his father and should be returned to Cuba,
denying a request by Lazaro Gonzalez that the boy be granted an
asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But Elian's great uncle filed a federal lawsuit to overturn the
decision of the Immigration Service. As the court fight dragged on,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez traveled from Havana to Washington on April 6
with his new wife and their son to take custody of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives, however, balked at giving up the boy,
even after his father agreed that he would not leave the country
until the court case was resolved. When the Miami relatives ignored
an order from Attorney General Janet Reno to give up the boy, Reno
ordered a raid on the Miami home by armed federal officers.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has remained in the Washington area since he was taken
from Miami as the case made its way through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld the denial of the amnesty hearing, but ordered the boy to
remain in the country as the relatives filed an appeal with the
full Court of Appeals. That appeal was also denied on June 23, and
the Miami relatives were given just five days to win an emergency
stay from the Supreme Court.

PIANIST'S CUP OF JOE BRIMMING WITH POSSIBILITIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ He isn't pouring as many grande coffees
these days. Christopher Basso says he has cut back his hours as
assistant manager at a New York City Starbucks to explore his
new-found _ and completely unexpected _ celebrity and ponder
offers.
</P>
<P>
   Basso, 41, a conservatory-trained pianist, won the International
Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs in Fort Worth earlier
this month. The competition, however, wasn't supposed to change
anyone's life.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by the Cliburn Foundation, the same organization that
presents the quadrennial Van Cliburn International Piano
Competition for professionals, the amateur was supposed to be a fun
``little brother'' version of the main event, aimed at accomplished
amateur pianists over age 35 who have careers in other fields.
</P>
<P>
   But Basso, who gives New Yorkers their daily joe at a Starbucks
in Manhattan's East Village, received a great deal of attention for
his win at the increasingly competitive Fort Worth event, and has
already played two recitals at professional venues. And, although
he doesn't have a manager at the moment, he has had serious concert
inquiries, forcing him to reduce his work schedule from full time
to 20 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``A month ago, I wouldn't have even considered it,'' Basso says,
in a telephone interview from the coffee shop. ``I've never been
the type to take risks like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Basso says he will use the extra time to practice, and will fall
back on savings, if necessary. ``If it doesn't work out, I can
always get more hours back,'' he says. ``I haven't burned any
bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   Basso's big break came on June 10, the day of the amateur
competition finals. Part of first prize was the opportunity to play
a recital eight days later at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington.
His performance received a favorable review in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The managers of the Rockport Chamber Music Festival, north of
Boston, got wind of Basso's success in Washington, and, when
pianist Helen Grimaud canceled her scheduled appearance last
Friday, they called Basso and asked him to fill in with only two
days' notice. His second solo recital resulted in an even more
favorable review in the Boston Globe, in which critic Ellen Pfeifer
predicted that ``Basso's simple life may soon see dramatic
change.''
</P>
<P>
   While this isn't the objective of the amateur competition, which
is dedicated to promoting the piano as a lifelong avocation, Maria
Guralnik, general manager of the Cliburn Foundation, says the
foundation is pleased to see Basso succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of exciting from the point of view of the Cliburn,''
Guralnik says. ``He didn't expect it, we didn't expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also points out that the professional ranks offer
intense competition, and it's yet to be seen whether Basso's window
of opportunity will close quickly or open to a new career path.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be interesting to see if this sustains,'' Guralnik
says. ``We hope he has his eyes open, and doesn't rush out and quit
his day job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of amateurs have done performances for which they get
paid,'' adds Cliburn Foundation President Richard Rodzinski.
``That's OK. In fact, it's proper that they get paid.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rodzinski says that creating professional pianists ``is not
what the amateur competition is about.''
</P>
<P>
   It has, however, been Basso's dream for much of his life. Basso,
a native of New Jersey, studied piano at the San Francisco
Conservatory, then settled in New York, where he worked at various
cafes and bars to support himself while continuing piano studies
with renowned instructor Nina Svetlanova and waiting for his big
break.
</P>
<P>
   Rodzinski says that Basso's circumstances raise some interesting
questions.
</P>
<P>
   For one, ``How many people of that caliber are working full-time
jobs (outside the music profession)?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Morgan Shafer, the operations manager for Starbucks
in Manhattan, heard about Basso's victory in Fort Worth and went to
meet his newly famous employee, who was back at work the Tuesday
after the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``When one of our associates wins a great achievement,'' Shafer
says, ``we like to celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   There are even discussions among Shafer, Basso and Allan
Hilowitz, Northeast regional spokesman for Starbucks, about
producing a CD of Basso performing, which would be played in
Starbucks stores and also be available for purchase, with prime
shelf space next to the coffeemakers, exotic blends, mugs and
flavorings.
</P>
<P>
   Basso's cup indeed is running over. Not only will his music
possibly be available in Starbucks across the country, but
presenters in Palm Springs and of an upcoming tour of the Russian
National Orchestra have expressed interest in Basso playing some
dates next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``These opportunities don't come along often,'' Basso says. ``My
idea is to just say yes.''

POLL SHOWS NEW YORK CITY'S BLACKS FEARING BIAS BUT OPTIMISTIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By BLAINE HARDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Black residents of New York City are afraid of being
brutalized by the police, but they welcome and appreciate officers
who keep criminals out of their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   At all income levels, blacks in the city are convinced that
racial discrimination limits their income and holds back job
advancement. Yet they also believe that the major reason that young
black men have troubled lives is not discrimination, but the
breakdown of black families and a lack of personal motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Amid New York's economic boom, with overall unemployment at a
12-year low, blacks in the city say their most important problem is
a lack of jobs. But they are convinced that their children will be
more successful than they have been.
</P>
<P>
   These ambivalent attitudes are part of a wide-ranging State of
Black New York poll conducted this month for the New York Urban
League. Based on random telephone interviews with 801 blacks across
the city, the survey paints a portrait of a community on edge, one
that feels victimized by unemployment, police brutality and racial
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   But it also shows that most blacks are optimistic about the
future, deeply committed to their churches and introspective about
a breakdown in black family life, which they link to the poor
performance of many young blacks in schools and the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there would be more consistency,'' said Dennis
Walcott, president of the New York Urban League, who helped write
the questions in the poll. ``The relationship between the local cop
and the black community is not as strained or as simple as has been
portrayed in the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Another polling surprise was the relative lack of support among
New York blacks for school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   While blacks had serious concerns about the quality of public
schools, only 41 percent of those polled supported using tax money
for vouchers. Fifty-three percent said tax money should be used
only for public education.
</P>
<P>
   The findings differ from most nationwide polls of blacks, which
have found support for vouchers running about 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Support for vouchers, as measured by the poll, increased sharply
among New York blacks as income decreased. A narrow majority of
households with yearly incomes under $10,000 supported vouchers.
But at income levels above $50,000, there was strong opposition to
shifting public money to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Income made little difference, though, in the perception among
blacks in New York that racial discrimination stains nearly every
aspect of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This survey shows that no matter how successful black people
become, they still suffer the slings and arrows of racism,''
Walcott said. ``Whether it is engagement with the police department
or issues involving promotion or disparity in wages, the figures
show that people feel that racism has touched their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name places where racial discrimination was most
common, the greatest proportion of those polled, 30 percent,
mentioned stores, where blacks have long complained about being
followed by clerks and security officers.
</P>
<P>
   Based on their perception of discrimination, more than four out
of five respondents said that affirmative action was still needed
in jobs and schools. Support for affirmative action was strongest
in households earning more than $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What jumps out at me from this survey is the emphasis on jobs
and economic development,'' said Walter Stafford, a professor of
public policy and urban planning at New York University who
analyzed the poll for the Urban League. ``Across the board, people
tend to perceive discrimination in access to jobs and mobility _
even at high income levels.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's unemployment rate in 1999 was 11.8 percent for black
men and 10.4 percent for women, compared with a citywide average of
6.7 percent last year. Black men and women had nearly double the
unemployment rates of whites in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``What also strikes me is that this is not a secure group,''
Stafford said, pointing to results showing that 53 percent of
respondents said they had no pensions other than Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, from June 5-16, was done for the New York Urban
League by Blum &AMP; Weprin Associates, a New York polling firm. About
70 percent of the respondents identified themselves as black or
African-American; about 30 percent said they were Caribbean or West
Indian blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the poll's findings, particularly those concerning black
attitudes toward the police, echo some results of two recent polls
by New York Times and CBS News. Those polls were conducted after
the police shooting of Amadou Diallo in February 1999 and the
shooting of Patrick M. Dorismond this March.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with The Times' polls, which surveyed New Yorkers of
all races, the Urban League survey contacted three to five times as
many black respondents in the city, making it relatively more
precise in assessing black views. The poll's margin of error is
plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The Urban League survey found a deep and pervasive ambivalence
among black New Yorkers in their attitudes toward the police. While
they feel that the police disproportionately victimize them because
they are black, they also want police protection against crime, the
poll found.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like straddling a fence,'' said Lileathea Grays-Wallace,
44, a divorced mother of three who lives in the South Bronx and who
participated in the poll. ``I am worried about the police on one
side and the criminals on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Like 45 percent of those polled in the survey, Grays-Wallace
said that she believed that the police in her immediate
neighborhood (she lives a block from a police station) did a
good-to-excellent job of being helpful and friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But four blocks down, I don't know,'' said Grays-Wallace, who,
like nearly nine of out 10 respondents in the survey, said police
brutality was a ``serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Her oldest daughter works as a dispatcher for the police
department, she said. Still, she said she was afraid that her
younger daughters, who are 13 and 8, would say the wrong thing to
the police on the street and be arrested or abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a miscommunication thing,'' she said. ``I tell my
daughters they will be judged by what they look like. I explain to
them to keep their senses up and show respect.''
</P>
<P>
   This simultaneous need for and fear of the police has
overwhelmed the life of Daisy Boyd, 77, who lives in the
Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn and also participated
in the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, her son, Daniel Lee, then 30, was shot to death
in front of her apartment when he tried to chase away gang members
selling drugs, Boyd said. Last week, she said that another son,
Jasper, 33, was arrested by the police and was forced to spend a
night in jail after he tried to stop a fight outside a homeless
shelter in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt my son so bad to be arrested that he just cried, and
he is a college graduate,'' Boyd said. ``Some of the police are
just mean. They don't like the black man, no way. The police seem
to be pretty nice to me, but they are not so nice to the young
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Urban League poll avoided questions about politics and
politicians, other than to ask if the withdrawal of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani from the Senate race would make black residents more or
less likely to vote in November. About three-quarters of those
polled said the withdrawal of the mayor, who is widely blamed by
blacks for worsening racial tensions in the city, would not affect
their interest in voting.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting the longstanding importance of the church in black
communities, the poll found religion plays a significant role in
the lives of an overwhelming majority of black New Yorkers. Nearly
four out of five respondents said that religion is either extremely
or very important, while 61 percent said they attended church at
least once a month and 35 percent said that they volunteer at least
five hours a month at their church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across all income levels, the church is important,'' said
Walcott of the New York Urban League.
</P>
<P>
   Walcott said that high levels of religious involvement are
connected to what he described as the poll's findings of
``introspection on the part of the black community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The poll got at the issue of family structure and how it
contributes to a lack of success for young black men,'' he said.
``It also talked about family dysfunction as a reason for poor
performance in school. The black community isn't solely dealing
with external conditions such as racism. It is also aware of the
internal issues that need to be addressed for equal opportunity to
be achieved.''

BUSINESS TRAVEL: AIR TRAFFIC DELAYS PILING UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: also moving in `t' news file.) 
 By JOE SHARKEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summer's here, business travelers! Time to glare at those
airport tote boards and boil.
</P>
<P>
   Summertime flight delays are starting to pile up as traffic
increases at domestic airports. And despite new strategies for
better-coordinated air traffic control responses to weather-related
delays that cause most of the problems in an overtaxed system, the
industry is worried that this summer is going to be a lot like last
summer, the worst period ever for domestic flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last summer was an unmitigated disaster,'' said David Fuscus,
the vice president for communications at the Air Transport
Association, the airline industry's main trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Fuscus didn't want to specifically predict another unmitigated
disaster. ``This summer it looks like we'll have the same type of
record,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, federal records so far indicate a slight improvement
in the situation this year. In April, the airline industry and the
Federal Aviation Administration put into place a new program called
the Spring/Summer 2000 Severe Weather Plan. Among its provisions,
Fuscus said, is a procedure that gives a ``more robust role'' to
the main federal air traffic control center in Virginia. This
enables controllers there to do central monitoring and adjusting of
traffic in every segment of the domestic system during those times
when bad weather in various places starts those airport tote boards
blinking.
</P>
<P>
   In May, flight delays dropped by 7 percent, the FAA said. But
the industry isn't exactly breaking out the Champagne over that.
``On the surface, it may sound good, and the FAA may tell you that
it's good _ until you consider that we've had a flight-delay crisis
over the last three summers, including this summer,'' Fuscus said.
``If you go back to May of 1997, though, you actually see an
increase in delays of 90 percent this May.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating another summer of snarled skies, some airlines are
even reducing flight schedules in advance. ``No one is more
frustrated by it than the airlines,'' Fuscus said. ``I mean, United
Airlines just canceled 4,500 flights throughout the summer because
there is no confidence they wouldn't be delayed.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall problem is an out-of-date air traffic control
system. ``It can't move enough planes through the sky quickly
enough under the present safety parameters, which are, of course,
correct,'' said Fuscus, whose organization has been assiduously
lobbying Congress to put a lot more money than it has so far into
modernizing the aged aviation infrastructure, which the airline
industry contends will take another seven to 10 years to bring
fully up to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, delays in the summer are here to stay until
that air traffic control system is fixed,'' Fuscus said. ``It gets
our customers screaming mad. And they don't get mad at the FAA,
they get mad at us.''
</P>
<P>
   But hey, it could be worse. For example, we could be stuck with
a system like the one in Europe, where antiquated technology
combines with nationalistic chauvinism to create an air traffic
network so fragile that some indignant Frenchmen can basically shut
it down like dairy farmers railing against European Union cheese
quotas.
</P>
<P>
   I refer to the situation in France this week. French air traffic
controllers, incensed at the European Union for discussing the idea
of a central, and perhaps partially privately owned, air traffic
system for all of Europe, walked off the job on for 24 hours on
Monday in a wildcat strike. The action grounded 90 percent of the
flights within France and caused backups and cancellations
throughout the Western European air system. About half of the
international flights that pass through French airspace were also
canceled, and stranded business travelers in France had to
commandeer space on busses and trains to get to neighboring
countries like Belgium to try to pick up flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our traffic is back to normal today, and we don't see any
other problems in the near future,'' a spokeswoman for Air France
said Tuesday afternoon. British Airways, which canceled 37 flights
to and from France on Monday, also said that its operations had
returned to normal. But the French protest spread Tuesday to
Greece, where air traffic controllers, demanding assurance that the
Greek system won't be privatized, began a four-day strike during
prime flight hours to make their feelings known about control-tower
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Jeanniot, the director general of the International Air
Transport Association, predicted a summer of major delays in the
European air system. ``The situation is totally unacceptable,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fuscus said: ``If there's an example of something that works
worse than our system, it's the European system. We've got a delay
crisis; they've got a delay calamity brewing. It's absolutely
abysmal. I can't imagine there could be anything worse than our
system in the summertime in terms of delays, but there it is:
Europe.''

 &HT;    IBM LAUNCHES WORLD'S FASTEST SUPERCOMPUTER
 &HT;    With SUPERCOMPUTER-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ IBM announced Thursday(cq) it has built the first
supercomputer that scientists hope is powerful enough to simulate
the explosion of a nuclear weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The $110 million machine is a major step toward an era when
computers will provide such benefits as vastly improved weather
forecasts and individually designed medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The new IBM computer, called ASCI White, weighs 106 tons and
occupies an area the size of two NBA basketball courts. It would
take the next four biggest computers in the world combined to equal
its enormous processing power.
</P>
<P>
   The new supercomputer can do 12.3 trillion calculations a
second, making it about 30,000 times more powerful than today's
desktop personal computers. It is 1,000 times more powerful than
IBM's Deep Blue, the supercomputer that beat chess champion Garry
Kasparov in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every man, woman and child on the face of the Earth would have
to add up 2,000 random numbers a second to keep up with this
machine,'' said David Cooper, chief information officer at the
Energy Department's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said he was ``cautiously optimistic'' that ASCI White
will for the first time let government scientists perform the
complex modeling and simulation needed to ensure the reliability of
the explosive yields in U.S. nuclear weapons, eliminating the need
for actual underground tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a lot of the old-timers will say, 'I'm not willing to give
up on testing until I see a lot more of these simulations,' ``
Cooper noted in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, using a model that makes 1 trillion calculations a
second, the Livermore lab was able to test nuclear weapon
``triggers.'' Combining those tests with ASCI White testing of
explosive yields would require 20 or 30 days of work on a computer
that makes 100 trillion calculations a second, Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has entered into ``discussions'' with the Energy
Department's office of defense programs to deliver just such a
machine by 2004, said Jim Jardine, IBM's Austin, Texas-based
project manager for ASCI White. The letters stand for the Energy
Department's ``accelerated strategic computing initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Livermore, nuclear simulation tests are also being
conducted at Los Alamos and the Sandia National Laboratories, both
in New Mexico. They are necessitated by the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, which the United States has not signed, but by which it
abides.
</P>
<P>
   IBM believes the supercomputing breakthrough can be applied to
other fields besides nuclear weapons. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Global weather modeling under which current 18-hour computing
cycles can be reduced to a few seconds, radically transforming
early warning systems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Production of pharmaceuticals that are custom-tailored to a
person's individual's genetic profile.
</P>
<P>
   _ Integrated monitoring of air routes, jet stream weather
patterns and pollution migration.
</P>
<P>
   The basic building block of the new IBM supercomputer is known
as the RS/6000. Since 1992, IBM has sold more than a million of
these machines to about 150,000 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Jardine noted that the ASCI White system rests on a structure
that combines many of these units, unlike ``the one-of-a-kind
(supercomputers) that not a lot of people can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in sheer scale, the new machine dwarfs all that has gone
before. For example, if it were to be deployed as a Web server, it
could process 6 billion online transactions in one minute flat.
</P>
<P>
   To get the job done:
</P>
<P>
   _ Its 8,192 microprocessors contain some 2,000 miles of copper
wiring.
</P>
<P>
   _ It holds than 160 trillion bytes of disk storage capacity,
enough to house twice the contents of the Library of Congress and
16,000 times more than high-end PC's equipped with 10 gigabytes of
storage capacity.
</P>
<P>
   _ It has a memory bank of 6.2 trillion bytes, nearly 100,000
times more than today's average desktop PC, which comes with 64
megabytes of memory.
</P>
<P>
   _ It requires 1.2 megawatts of electricity, enough to power a
small-sized city.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shipments of the machine from the IBM performance testing
facility in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., to Livermore, which have already
begun, is requiring 28 tractor trailer trucks.
</P>

supercomputers.

WINDOWS ME TAILOR - MADE FOR HOME USE
</HEADLINE>
  By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is nearly midnight, and I am painfully aware why I answer as
I do when asked the question: ``Do you want the beta version of
this program, or would you rather wait for the final product?''
Final product.
</P>
<P>
   The exception to that rule is currently on my computer monitor:
Windows Millennium Edition, shortened to ``Windows Me'' on the
splash screen that comes up each time the program starts. I have
the beta release of Windows Me.
</P>
<P>
   Windows Woe Is Me.
</P>
<P>
   Things will improve rapidly between this nearly finished version
and Sept. 14 when the product goes on the shelves. Truthfully,
there are not many hangups, and those are being rapidly tracked
down by beta testers and squished by programmers across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   This is beta version 3.94. Even though I should know better, I
have volunteered to take a look because it is the latest major
upgrade to the popular Windows operating system for home users from
Microsoft. When Windows 2000 was released in the past year, many
home users were wondering whether that system, designed mainly for
business, was for them. The answer was: ``It wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll be asking the same thing about Windows Me as the final
release date draws closer. This time the answer is: ``Microsoft has
designed WinMe with home users in mind. There are plenty of
improvements _ including faster boot-up and more stability. There
is a much-needed `System Restore' feature to revert the system to
where it was before it stopped working. Networking one home
computer with another has been made easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Installing WinMe took about half an hour of mainly sitting and
waiting for the CD to run its course _ or at least the second
install did. The first one failed to catch fire, but that was
probably because the ``C'' drive on the computer didn't have enough
real estate left undeveloped on which to build. WinMe recognized
that and suggested Drive E as its new home.
</P>
<P>
   But WinMe apparently didn't like Drive E, for it certainly
balked enough times before it was obvious that it wasn't going to
live there. Fortunately, I'd taken the program's suggestion to
create an uninstall disk before proceeding. When the install
failed, that disk came to the rescue and, after about five minutes
of thrashing around, WinMe was gone and Windows 98 had returned.
</P>
<P>
   Note to readers: Forewarned is forearmed.
</P>
<P>
   Before upgrading, clean up Drive C to free as much space as
possible. Run the defragment and scan disk programs. Back up the
drive, create the uninstall disk as directed, and then install
WinMe.
</P>
<P>
   Having done that, WinMe sniffed around Drive C and immediately
took a liking to the neighborhood. In the process, it managed to
find a CD-ROM drive, CD-rewriteable drive, Zip drive, modem card,
sound card, video card, printer, and assorted other items attached
to the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for the new splash screen _ a pure white
background replacing the blue-sky one of Windows 98 _ you might not
even notice WinMe was running on the surface. The desktop is still
the same and the icons for programs are there.
</P>
<P>
   Why bother, then? For one thing, the program cranks up a lot
faster than Windows 98. That in itself is no big deal, but it's
still the first thing most people may notice _ particularly if you
have a lot of things attached to the computer and it presently
takes its sweet time getting ready for work.
</P>
<P>
   Another big change is at the other end of things: the shut-down
options. WinMe has added a stand-by option for desktops that
basically put things in a sleep mode, thus allowing a quick
resumption of work instead of completely shutting down and starting
over. For longer durations, the computer can put itself into what's
termed ``hybernation'' where work in progress is saved to disk and
the system is reduced to its lowest power state.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus: Getting two computers connected _ even if only one
is running WinMe _ is much easier than it used to be. I had taken
out the network card before the second installation. Once WinMe was
in place and running, the network card went back in its slot. WinMe
found it on reboot, and a ``network wizard'' walked me through
setting it up for connection to the second computer. If the second
computer is running Windows 95 or 98, WinMe will instruct the user
to insert a blank floppy disk to transport a needed program over to
the other computer so the two can connect.
</P>
<P>
   WinMe's beta version occasionally locks up on start up, an odd
behavior that is usually corrected by rebooting and, I've found, is
completely avoided by disconnecting the computer from the network.
The beta testers with similar network set ups have no doubt found
and corrected it in newer beta revisions.
</P>
<P>
   WinMe's improved behavior over the past few weeks has allowed
exploration. The basics are still there (Windows Explorer, the
program for examining the contests of disk drives and folders, is
now found under the ``accessories'' group in the menu) and things
work pretty much the same.
</P>
<P>
   A Windows Movie Maker makes importing and editing video much
easier. It's a sophisticated program that simplifies creating video
to e-mail to friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   What Movie Maker does for videos Windows Me's Media Player does
for audio files. There's a feature that puts dancing circles and
bars on the screen that pulse in time to the music for those who
like eye candy. More useful, however, is the player's ability to
create and index high-quality audio files.
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued that all of these features can be found in
freeware, shareware or commercial offerings from other third-party
developers. Indeed, System Restore is a plain-vanilla offering of
GoBack, a program from Wild File that was reviewed here several
months back. (A spokeswoman for Wild File said System Restore lacks
many of the features that has drawn users to GoBack; the company
has come out with a version that can be used with Windows Me.) The
new Windows Me combines all the other useful programs under one
operating roof, makes improvements to them in some cases, and then
provides a standardization of user controls among the programs.
</P>
<P>
   The price hasn't been firmed up yet, but I've seen estimates
ranging from $60 to $90 for the new operating system. Based on
previous Windows upgrades, those are reasonable expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Is Windows Me in your future? If you're among the 15 million
households with two computers and want to connect them, or you've

&HT;     MIRANDA RULINGS LIKELY TO CHANGE POLICE PRACTICES IN
CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The U.S. Supreme Court's unexpectedly strong
affirmation of the Miranda rule for suspects in police custody will
likely stem a practice in California that allowed officers to
deliberately violate it.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second decision from the court Monday that put extra
muscle behind Miranda, which requires that the police advise
suspects of their right to remain silent before interrogations. The
other decision let stand a ruling from a federal appeals court in
San Francisco that said officers who deliberately breach Miranda by
questioning suspects after they invoke their rights may be held
personally liable.
</P>
<P>
   But what most surprised both opponents and defenders of the 1966
Miranda decision was that it was upheld by a lopsided 7-2 vote in a
decision written by one of Miranda's staunchest critics, Chief
Justice William Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We . . . hold that Miranda and its progeny in this court
govern the admissibility of statements made during custodial
interrogation in both state and federal courts,'' Rehnquist wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia wrote an angry dissent, joined by Justice
Clarence Thomas, that was longer than the majority opinion. It
accused the majority of producing an incoherent opinion that
improperly expanded judicial powers.
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion, in a bank robbery case from Virginia
called Dickerson vs. United States, said Miranda was a
``constitutional rule that Congress may not supersede.'' The
opinion reversed an appeals court decision that said a never-used
1968 congressional act had thrown out the Miranda warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had expected to win,'' said Paul Cassell, the University of
Utah law professor who had argued against Miranda in the Virginia
case. ``I think it's a tragic opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassell said the decision would let thousands of criminals go
free, because when officers violate the Miranda rule courts are
required to bar prosecutors from using the confession to prove the
suspect's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, who had defended Miranda
in the case, hailed the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``For decades, the Miranda ruling set out clear standards for
police officers, helped get confessions admitted into evidence, and
ensured the credibility of confessions in the eyes of jurors,'' she
said. ``Most importantly, it will continue to provide a public
sense of fairness in our criminal justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   Both court actions had special meaning for California, where the
police have been trained in recent years that Miranda was not a
constitutional requirement and that they could choose whether to
honor suspects' assertions of their rights, or simply keep
questioning them.
</P>
<P>
   Although police officers could not use the resulting confession
to prove guilt in court, they could use it to gather other evidence
that could be used in court and to challenge the suspect's trial
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The police had called the tactic ``questioning outside'' or
``questioning past'' Miranda. But judges around the state had
called the practice ``very troubling,'' ``police misconduct'' and
``slippery and illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and defense lawyers had awaited the Supreme Court
rulings in hope it would clarify police duties during
interrogations.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Weisselberg, a law professor at the University of
California at Berkeley who filed briefs in both Miranda cases, said
the police around the state had routinely questioned suspects
outside Miranda but, ``After this, police agencies should simply
follow Miranda.''
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general's office, which in recent years had
told police officers that the Miranda warnings were not
constitutionally required, had no comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still reviewing the decision,'' said Nathan Barankin, a
spokesman for state Attorney General Bill Lockyer, a Democrat.

HEARTS OF PALM: A SUGAR CUBE OF STUCCO 
</HEADLINE>
   By MITCHELL OWENS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The best thing about this neighborhood
is you can step outside to get the paper and not see anybody you
know,'' Mario Nievera said. Which can be a blessing, he added,
``because we live pretty public lives here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here'' is Palm Beach, a posh playground for Vanderbilts,
Astors and their ilk since the 1920s, and Nievera is not being
boastful about the high-profile existence shared by him and his
partner, Robert Janjigian. A gregarious, notebook-wielding presence
at cocktail parties and charity events, Janjigian, 42, is the
fashion editor of The Palm Beach Daily News, known as The Shiny
Sheet for its slick finish. The gardens Nievera, 35, creates for
members of the local fete set show up in Architectural Digest. Yet,
their primary residence is comfortably modest. So is its location.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-seven miles north of Miami, West Palm is Palm Beach's
renegade mainland sister, the grinning tomboy who married the
family chauffeur and settled down to car pool and lunchbox bliss.
Pockmarked with strip malls and laced with freeway asphalt, the
city was founded in 1894 as the railroad stop for moneyed New
Yorkers escaping harsh winters, so its landscape is nowhere as
grand as that found across the bay bridge in Palm Beach. There the
shady streets are lined with Norma Desmond Spanish villas designed
in the 1920s by Addison Mizner, a theatrical architect and flimflam
man.
</P>
<P>
   Nievera and Janjigian's house, on the other hand, is an
Eisenhower-era relic, which they bought for $80,000 four years ago.
A tidy sugar cube of pale beige stucco smoothly troweled over
concrete blocks, its mass-market modernism shelters two bedrooms
and one bath. The front door is tucked inside the carport and leads
directly into the kitchen. ``I couldn't do anything about the
placement of the front door, so this part of the garden is designed
like a vestibule,'' Nievera said, opening a gate cut into a thick
viburnum hedge alongside the house.
</P>
<P>
   Their slim-jim trunks standing at attention like green
sculptures in a pale marble room, a formal allee of Alexander
coconut palms sprouts from a carpet of glistening white pebbles.
``It's very easy to maintain,'' Nievera said. ``You see every leaf
that falls, so you have to pick it up.'' Soft mounds of Mexican
heather and butterfly bush soften the edges of the formal
French-influenced layout, and funky metal and wire chairs painted
white or delicate hydrangea blue peek through the tropical
greenery.
</P>
<P>
   Though it seems peaceful now, traffic goes by all the time, ``so
it was on the market for a while,'' Nievera said. (High-profile
additions to the city like the Raymond F. Kravis Center for the
Performing Arts, the prestigious Palm Beach Antiques Show and the
CityPlace housing development have sent real estate prices
skyrocketing.)
</P>
<P>
   As for their house, there were myriad drawbacks. Crank-out
jalousie windows, for instance, were once the last word in
low-maintenance chic, but half the panes had fallen out. Indoors
was an air-conditioner free zone of white and teal blue. And the
flat wood roof, he recalled with a shudder, leaked. ``At first, I
thought I would just fix it up and sell it,'' Nievera said, adding
that the house was built in 1957 as a retirement home for its
previous owner, a librarian.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it sat in the front half of a 25-by-100-foot lot
that was a blank horticultural slate. There was nary a shrub,
Nievera recalled. He threw himself into basic improvements.
``Robert was still living in New York, and he would not move in
without air-conditioning,'' he said. Nor was Janjigian thrilled
with the kitchen's worn Formica countertops and outmoded
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Nievera changed the windows, too, replacing most with
aluminum-frame French doors that opened the house's 1,200 square
feet to the surrounding gardens, a space-enhancement underscored by
new Italian-tile floors whose worn-white color blends with the
outdoor gravel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've made even $20,000 worth of improvements,''
Nievera said. Indeed, like his partner, Nievera is a devotee of
cheap chic. ``Those came from Pier 1,'' he said, pointing out the
galvanized tin lanterns that punctuate the corners of the thin
white swimming pool out back.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   White chaise lounges, vintage Knoll, were castoffs from a
landscape client, and the cedar-walled outdoor shower was built
from a kit ordered from Walpole Woodworkers in Maine. Thanks to the
no-winter climate, ``we have yet to use the shower inside the
house,'' Nievera said.
</P>
<P>
   When the house had been upgraded, he gratefully handed over the
decorating reins to Janjigian, who was formerly an editor at
Rizzoli and wrote a book about yacht interiors. Still, Nievera was
momentarily worried. Living in a small house requires a certain
amount of restraint, and ``Robert has a tendency to overcollect,''
he said. ``We have a garage sale twice a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Janjigian, whose black-frame glasses and firm jaw give him a
Cary Grant-like suavity, laughed. ``OK, so I'm a scavenger,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of his primary sites for shopping is the nearby town of Lake
Worth, where stylish vintage furniture often goes for prices that
make out-of-town friends jealous.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was $300,'' he said of one of his Lake Worth finds, a
1940s chest, its sides paved with smoked mirror (it opens to reveal
cocktail equipment). A pair of sleek Danish Modern chairs from the
1960s cost $30 from the Goodwill thrift shop in West Palm. The big
square ottoman in the combination guest room and office was rescued
from a Manhattan sidewalk and snappily recovered in white patent
leather.
</P>
<P>
   As for the artwork, it is a motley array, ranging from two dozen
Russel Wright wall clocks in the kitchen _ one for every hour of
the day, said Janjigian, who bought them on eBay _ to three
hypnotic photographs of rippling blue water snapped by the makeup
maven Evelyn Lauder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried a million things up there,'' Janjigian said of a long
narrow bit of wall above a built-in shelving unit that his partner
designed for the dining area. After a while, he settled on a bad
1960s painting of skyscrapers, as seen from the Statue of Liberty.
``Of course, it would be ideal to have a Rothko,'' he said with a
grin. ``But we're not quite there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he wanted to respect its architecture, Janjigian also
wanted to avoid transforming the house into a picture-perfect paean
to mid-century modernism. ``And I didn't want to get too fussy,''
he said. ``When you have a small space, you have to pick things
that don't fill it up.'' Which explains why the furnishings are few
but juxtaposed with spirit, creating uncomplicated but visually
stimulating roomscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The chaise lounge in the living area is classic Le Corbusier,
but the exuberant gilt sconce hanging nearby is pure Palm Beach
baroque, circa 1962. A bedspread printed with big tropical leaves
gives a Heywood-Wakefield side table a funky South Beach look. And
even though the couple try to keep Palm Beach at a distance in
their private life, a bit of it remains in view: A little
Torquemada-style carved wood stool that once graced mansions across
the bay. ``Yeah, it's Mizner,'' Janjigian admitted, adding added,
diplomatically: ``I mean, I had to buy it. After all, we do live
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Budget-conscious tastemakers favor consignment and secondhand
shops on South County Road in Palm Beach and Lake Avenue and Dixie
Highway in Lake Worth filled with ``very 1940s and 1950s glamorous
kinds of stuff, things you know once lived in a great house, with
people with style,'' said Mish Tworkowski, a Manhattan jeweler and
Sotheby's expert _ like red metal chandeliers in the shape of coral
branches and fiercely button-tufted sofas a la Syrie Maugham. Margo
de Peyster, a leader of Palm Beach's young social set, recommended
the Church Mouse thrift shop at 374 S. County Rd. in Palm Beach,
(561) 659-2154. Other excellent sources are the Goodwill shop (561)
832-8893 and the dealer Peter Werner (561) 832-0428.

 &HT;    How to restain a stained deck
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ D.D. sent an e-mail message saying his 4-year-old
deck originally was sealed with a semi-transparent brown finish,
then resealed two years ago with a semi-transparent redwood finish.
He doesn't like the redwood finish and now wants to refinish the
deck to match a nearby fence that was coated with a solid stain in
a light color called pecan tan. He wanted to know if he can use the
light-colored solid stain over the old redwood finish. He also
wanted to know how to clean the deck without harming nearby foliage
with deck-cleaning chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Suggestion: I talked to L.J. Murphy of Centerville Deck
Services and Rick Weese of Deck and Fence Renewal Systems, also in
Centerville, and the short answer is that you can use a solid-color
stain on a deck that was previously treated with a semi-transparent
stain and get good coverage. But there are a few other issues you
need to be aware of. Before you use the solid-color stain, you must
be sure that the old sealer has stopped repelling water. Wait until
the deck is completely dry _ no rain for at least two days _ and
splash some water on the deck in various spots, including spots
that get little foot traffic. If the water quickly soaks in,
darkening the wood where it lands, the deck is ready for resealing.
If the water just beads up, you're better off waiting until next
year to do the solid stain.
</P>
<P>
   If you choose to proceed, clean the deck before staining. The
concern about damaging plants near the deck with cleaning chemicals
is a legitimate one. Avoid products with bleach. Look on the label,
usually in the ``Warning'' label area, for the ingredient sodium
hypochlorite; this is bleach. Some products say ``no bleach'' on
the label, but they don't list their active ingredients. Powdered
cleaners that mix with water, such as Wolman's Deck and Fence
Brightener, are a good choice for cleaning decks. The cleaning
solution has a foaming action and is less toxic to plants than
bleach. Wolman's is hard to find, but Sears Hardware stores and
Meijer usually have it. Whatever deck wash you use, follow the
directions on the container. Use a garden hose to soak the plants
surrounding the deck before cleaning; this will dilute any cleaner
that gets on the plants. And clean the deck on a day with little
wind.
</P>
<P>
   The cleaning process will remove any dirt from the deck, and it
will also remove much of the remains of the semi-transparent stain
you applied two years ago. Wait at least two days after cleaning to
apply the new stain. A solid-color stain colors like a paint, but,
unlike a paint, it sinks into the surface of the wood. Because the
color is solid, it will completely cover any previous color.
</P>
<P>
   Before staining, you might want to test the stain in an
inconspicuous spot to see the effect it has on the wood. Once a
stain is in place, it's difficult or impossible to remove it
without sanding away the top layers of the boards or replacing
boards altogether. A solid-color stain should last four or five
years on upright deck posts, but it will wear out on the floor
boards in about two years. You should reseal when the floorboards
show obvious signs of wear. In the future, you should use the same
color stain or a darker stain. It's hard to cover a dark
solid-color stain with a lighter one.
</P>
<P>
   VENT DRYER OUTDOORS IF AT ALL POSSIBLE
</P>
<P>
   P.D. has a clothes dryer in her basement, and she has used it
for years without a vent attached to the hot-air outlet at the back
of the dryer. She said the nearest obvious spot where the vent
could be placed is a window 12 to 15 feet from the dryer. She can't
move the dryer under the window because that would take it too far
from its heavy-duty plug. That would also make transferring clothes
from the washer to the dryer difficult. Can a vent pipe be run from
the dryer to the window?
</P>
<P>
   _ Suggestion: The first thing P.D. should do is check her
laundry room, especially the area behind the dryer, for accumulated
lint and clean up any she finds. Lint is flammable, and one thing a
vent pipe does is carry the potential fire fuel away from the heat
of the dryer. The other thing a vent pipe does is take heat and
moisture outside the house, and that is critical in hot months.
</P>
<P>
   Both a product technician from Frigidaire, the manufacturer of
P.D.'s dryer, and Bill Davidson, vice president of Authorized
Service in Dayton, said a vent pipe connecting the dryer to the
window across the room should work fine. The owner's manual that
comes with each type of dryer will give specific directions for
venting, but most of them are similar. Davidson said the maximum
length for an exhaust pipe for a standard home dryer is about 50
feet, and each bend in the pipe counts as 8 feet. In other words, a
pipe with no bends can run 50 feet, but a pipe that has two bends
in it can only run about 34 feet. The whole assembly to vent the
dryer in question _ flexible aluminum pipe, fasteners, connectors,
the vent itself and a piece of plywood to replace a basement window
pane _ should cost less than $50.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where there is no outlet for the dryer, use a
bucket-type vent-trap kit, which sells at home-improvement stores
for about $9. With a vent trap, a piece of flexible vent hose is
connected to the top of a small plastic container with water at the
bottom. Hot air from the dryer blows into the container, and the
lint is caught in the water to prevent a fire hazard. Water in the
trap has to be changed regularly, and the trap does nothing to cut
down on the heat and humidity the dryer will pump into your living
space all summer. On a related topic, home-improvement stores also
sell inexpensive diverter boxes that can be spliced into the middle
of flexible vent pipes so some of the dryer's heat and moisture
stay indoors in winter.

&HT;     COURT SAYS BOY SCOUTS MAY EXCLUDE GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Boy Scouts of America may prevent homosexuals
from becoming troop leaders, a sharply divided Supreme Court said
Wednesday, ruling that the Scouts are a private organization and as
such have a right to exclude people who don't share their values.
</P>
<P>
   In its 5-4 decision, the court also said that forcing the Boy
Scouts to accept openly gay troop leaders would violate the group's
First Amendment right to free association.
</P>
<P>
   While the court did not address the ramifications of its ruling,
some lawyers said it may allow the 6.2-million-member organization
to bar homosexual boys from membership.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, noted
that the organization ``asserts that homosexual conduct is
inconsistent with the values it seeks to instill.'' He added that
the state of New Jersey's effort to require it to accept a gay
scoutmaster ``would significantly burden the organization's right
to oppose or disfavor homosexual conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's opinion was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting, Justice John Paul Stevens argued that the New Jersey
law could not ``burden'' the Scouts' message because the group has
no specific ban on homosexuality in its literature, only references
to being ``morally straight'' and ``clean.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To assert the right to association, the organization must at
least show it has adopted and advocated an unequivocal position
inconsistent with a position advocated by the person whom the
organization seeks to exclude,'' Stevens wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' dissent was joined by Justices David H. Souter, Ruth
Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Roy L. Williams, who heads the Boy Scouts of America, said the
court's decision will allow his group to continue its ``mission of
providing character-building experiences for young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams added, ``The Boy Scouts of America, as a private
organization, must have the right to establish its own standards of
membership if it is to continue to instill the values of the Scout
Oath and Law in boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Other supporters of the decision hailed it as a victory for
private organizations that want to run their groups without
government interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision will have a dramatic impact on all private
organizations _ including religious groups _ to define their own
mission and set their own criteria for leadership,'' said Vincent
P. McCarthy, senior counsel for the American Center for Law and
Justice here, a conservative group that filed a friend-of-the-court
brief for the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   But James Dale, the New Jersey assistant scoutmaster ousted when
the organization learned he is gay, said he was ``definitely
saddened by the decision. People don't join the Boy Scouts because
they're anti-gay. People join the Boy Scouts because they want
acceptance, they want community.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale's lawyer, Evan Wolfson, said he thinks the high court
ruling ``suggests that homosexual boys may be barred from becoming
Scouts. ``They won the right to declare themselves an anti-gay
group,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   University of Southern California law professor Erwin
</P>
<P>
   Chemerinsky agreed, saying, ``I don't see any basis for drawing
a
</P>
<P>
   distinction between Scout leaders and Scouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Varona, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, the
nation's largest gay rights group, said, ``We are gravely
disappointed with a ruling that gives the Boy Scouts of America the
ability to discriminate with impunity. Is this any way to teach
youth about fairness, honesty and justice?''
</P>
<P>
   The case began in 1989 when Dale, then 19, applied to be an
adult Scout leader of a troop in Matawan, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, he had been an exemplary Boy Scout and had earned the
Eagle Scout Badge _ Scouting's highest award _ when he was a member
of a troop in Middletown, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   His application for a leadership role was accepted, and he
served 16 months as an assistant scoutmaster for the Matawan troop.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he was attending Rutgers University, where he was
co-president of the university's Lesbian/Gay Alliance. In July 1990
he acknowledged his homosexuality in a speech dealing with the
needs of lesbian and gay teenagers. The speech was reported in a
local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Later that month, the Boy Scouts sent him a letter severing
their relationship with him. When he sought an explanation, the
Scouts replied that his acknowledged homosexuality was ``contrary
to the values of the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Dale sued the Scouts for reinstatement under a New
Jersey law that forbids discrimination in ``public accommodations''
on the basis of race, gender, religion or sexual orientation. Dale
claimed that the Boy Scouts of America, which often works with
schools and other government institutions and has chapters in every
state, is a public accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   A state trial court, however, ruled that it is not and that
forcing the group to accept a gay scout leader would be
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Dale appealed the decision and last year, the New Jersey Supreme
Court ruled that the Boy Scouts organization is a ``public
accommodation,'' to which the state law applies.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the New Jersey
appellate decision. It added that since the Scouts are a private
organization, the state may not ``interfere'' with its message to
its members.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice emphasized, however, that the court's decision
was ``not guided by its view of whether the Boy Scouts' teachings
with respect to homosexual conduct are right or wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Thomas Baker, a law professor at Drake University
in Des Moines, Iowa, the court was forced to choose between two
competing constitutional issues _ fighting discrimination and
preserving the right of groups to choose their own members.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, the court decided this case was not about gay
rights but about free association,'' Baker said. ``The decision
definitely will put some limits on how far courts can go in forcing
private groups to open their admissions.''

   ALBRIGHT-MIDEAST (Jerusalem) _ Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright failed Wednesday to win Palestinian agreement for a
U.S.-Israeli-PLO summit which Washington hopes will lead to a peace
treaty by a September target date. Palestinian officials said a
decision on whether to hold a summit sought by Israel and hosted by
the United States must await the outcome of further

is still backward and not yet ready to open up to political

   SCOTUS-ABORTION (Washington) _ The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday
by a 5-4 vote that because the procedure widely known as ``partial
birth abortion'' may be the most medically appropriate way of
terminating some pregnancies, the government cannot prohibit
doctors from performing it. The decision declared unconstitutional
the Nebraska law before the court, as well as, in effect, the laws
of 30 other states. In addition, the bill to create a federal ban
on the procedure, which President Clinton has vetoed twice and
which may reach his desk again this year, would also be
unconstitutional under the court's analysis: Like all the other
laws, it does not contain an exception for the health of the
pregnant woman. By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-GAY-SCOUTS (Washington) _ The Supreme Court ruled
Wednesday by a 5-4 vote that the Boy Scouts have a constitutional
right to exclude gay members because opposition to homosexuality
was part of the organization's ``expressive message.'' Writing for
the court Wednesday, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said the
court intended neither to approve nor disapprove the Boy Scouts'
views on the subject, but that the First Amendment's protection for
freedom of association meant that the state could not compel the
Boy Scouts ``to accept members where such acceptance would derogate
from the organization's expressive message.'' By Linda Greenhouse.

<P>
   SCOTUS-SCHOOLS (Washington) _ Taxpayer money can be used to buy

the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday as it lowered the figurative wall

federal efforts to connect every American classroom to the
Internet. The decision also is sure to be cited as a big victory

past eight years ``were bogus.'' In a wide-ranging discussion that

upturn in inflation. But the central bank warned that it could
start raising rates again as soon as its next meeting, on Aug. 22,

 SNAKE NOT CHARMED? HOW TO SURVIVE AN ATTACK 
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: The hike is going great. You're almost at the end
of the trail, feeling fine, when suddenly you trip over something
that looks a bit like a garden hose. Your good mood turns to horror
as you realize that it's not a hose, it's a snake _ and it's about
to sink its fangs into your leg. What should you do? This excerpt
from ``The WORST-CASE SCENARIO Survival Handbook'' explains how to
avoid a snake attack and what to do if, despite your best efforts,
you are bitten.)

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because poisonous snakes can be difficult to identify _ and
because some nonpoisonous snakes have markings very similar to
venomous ones _ the best way to avoid getting bitten is to leave
all snakes alone.
 &UR; HOW TO AVOID AN ATTACK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ If you come across a snake, do not try to get a closer look,
prod the snake to make it move or try to kill it. Back away slowly
and give it a wide berth: Snakes can easily strike half their body
length in an instant, and some species are 6 feet or longer.
</P>
<P>
   _ When hiking in an area with poisonous snakes, always wear
thick leather boots and long pants.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep to marked trails.
</P>
<P>
   _ Snakes are cold-blooded and need the sun to help regulate
their body temperature. They are often found lying on warm rocks or
in other sunny places.
 &UR; HOW TO TREAT A BITE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you are bitten, don't panic. Follow these steps:
</P>
<P>
   _ Wash the bite with soap and water as soon as you can.
</P>
<P>
   _ Immobilize the bitten area and keep it lower than the heart.
This will slow the flow of the venom.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get medical help as soon as possible. Of about 8,000 venomous
bites a year in the United States, nine to 15 victims die.
</P>
<P>
   A bite from any type of poisonous snake should always be
considered a medical emergency. Even bites from nonpoisonous snakes
should be treated professionally, as severe allergic reactions can
occur.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you will not be able to reach medical care within 30
minutes, immediately wrap a bandage tightly 2 to 4 inches above the
bite to help slow the venom. The bandage should not cut off blood
flow from a vein or artery. Make the bandage loose enough for a
finger to slip underneath.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have a first-aid kit equipped with a suction device,
follow the instructions for helping to draw venom out of the wound
without making an incision. Generally, you will need to place the
rubber suction cup over the wound and attempt to draw the venom out
from the bite marks.
 &UR; WHAT NOT TO DO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not place ice on the bite; this will make removing the
venom with suction more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not tie a bandage or a tourniquet too tightly. If used
incorrectly, a tourniquet can cut blood flow completely and damage
the limb.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not make any incision on or around the wound in an attempt
to remove the venom. There is danger of infection.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not attempt to suck out the venom. You do not want it in
your mouth, where it might enter your bloodstream.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: HOW TO ESCAPE FROM A PYTHON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike poisonous snakes, pythons and boas kill their prey not
through the injection of venom but by constriction. That's why
these snakes are known as constrictors. A constrictor coils its
body around its prey, squeezing it until the pressure is great
enough to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Since pythons and boas can grow to be nearly 20 feet long, they
are capable of killing a grown person. Small children are even more
vulnerable. The good news is that most pythons will strike and then
try to get away, rather than consume a full-grown human.
</P>
<P>
   If you become a victim, here's what to do:
</P>
<P>
   _ Remain still. This will minimize constriction strength _ but a
python usually continues constricting well after the prey is dead
and not moving.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try to control the python's head and try to unwrap the coils,
starting from whichever end is available.

 LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP: HOW TO SURVIVE A JUMP INTO WATER FROM A
BRIDGE OR CLIFF 
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Harrison Ford did it in ``The Fugitive.'' So did
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. OK, unless you're a movie hero,
you'll probably never be forced to leap from a cliff or bridge into
water. But, hey, you never know. And if you should one day find
yourself perched on the edge, with nowhere else to go, wouldn't you
like to be prepared? The following excerpt from ``The WORST-CASE
SCENARIO SURVIVAL Handbook'' offers tips that can raise your
chances of surviving such a leap.)  
 (Includes B&AMP;W illustration of a man jumping into water. CREDIT:
ILLUSTRATION BY BRENDA BROWN.) 
 By JOSHUA PIVEN and DAVID BORGENICHT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When attempting a high fall (more than 20 feet) into water in an
emergency situation, you will not know much about your
surroundings, specifically the depth of the water. This makes
jumping particularly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   If you must jump from a bridge into a river or other body of
water with boat traffic, try to land in the channel _ the
deep-water area where boats go under the bridge. This area is
generally in the center, away from the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   Stay away from any area with pylons that are supporting the
bridge. Debris can collect in these areas and you can hit it when
you enter the water.
</P>
<P>
   Swim to shore immediately after surfacing.
 &UR; HOW TO JUMP &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Jump feet first.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep your body completely vertical.
</P>
<P>
   _ Squeeze your feet together.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enter the water feet first, and clench your buttocks together.
If you do not, water may rush in and cause severe internal damage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Protect your crotch area by covering it with your hands.
</P>
<P>
   _ Immediately after you hit the water, spread your arms and legs
wide and move them back and forth to generate resistance, which
will slow your plunge to the bottom. Always assume the water is not
deep enough to keep you from hitting bottom.
 &UR; REMAIN AWARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Hitting the water as described above could save your life,
although it may break your legs.
</P>
<P>
   _ If your body is not straight, you can break your back upon
entry. Keep yourself vertical until you hit the water.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not even think about going in headfirst unless you are
absolutely sure that the water is at least 20 feet deep. If your
legs hit the bottom, they will break. If your head hits, your skull
will break.

 THEY SHOOT HORSES, DON'T THEY? WHAT TO DO IF YOU BREAK YOUR LEG 
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: OK, Weekend Warrior. Summer is here, and that means
it's time to be out playing basketball, softball, tennis, soccer or
whatever sport you're into this year. It also means your chances of
getting injured are pretty good. What if you _ or one of your
buddies _ breaks a leg while sliding into first or trying to jump
over the net? Be prepared. This excerpt from ``The WORST-CASE
SCENARIO Survival Guide'' explains what to do _ and what not to do
_ to treat a leg fracture.)  
 (Includes B&AMP;W illustration of an injured leg being tied onto a
splint. CREDIT: ILLUSTRATION BY BRENDA BROWN.) 
 By JOSHUA PIVEN and DAVID BORGENICHT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most leg injuries are only sprains, but the treatment for both
sprains and fractures is the same.
 &UR; SYMPTOMS OF A FRACTURE, SPRAIN OR DISLOCATION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Difficult or limited movement
</P>
<P>
   _ Swelling of the affected area
</P>
<P>
   _ Bruising
</P>
<P>
   _ Numbness
</P>
<P>
   _ Severe bleeding
</P>
<P>
   _ A visible break of bone through the skin
 &UR; HOW TO TREAT A LEG FRACTURE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ If skin is broken, do not touch or put anything on the wound.
You must avoid infection. If the wound is bleeding severely, try to
stop the flow of blood by applying steady pressure to the affected
area with sterile bandages or clean clothes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not move the injured leg _ you need to splint the wound to
stabilize the injured area. Find two stiff objects of the same
length _ wood, plastic or folded cardboard _ for the splints.
</P>
<P>
   _ Put the splints above and below the injured area _ under the
leg (or on the side if moving the leg is too painful).
</P>
<P>
   _ Tie the splints with string, rope or belts _ whatever is
available. Alternatively, use clothing torn into strips. Make sure
the splint extends beyond the injured area.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not tie the splints too tightly; this may cut off
circulation. You should be able to slip a finger under the rope or
fabric. If the splinted area becomes pale or white, loosen the
ties.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have the injured person lie flat on his or her back. This
helps blood continue to circulate and many prevent shock.
 &UR; WHAT TO AVOID &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not push at, probe or attempt to clean an injury; this can
cause infection.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not move the injured person unless absolutely necessary.
Treat the fracture and then go get help.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the person must be moved, be sure the injury is completely
immobilized first.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not elevate the injured leg.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not attempt to move or reset a broken bone; this will cause
severe pain and may complicate the injury.

 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Bears are getting bolder these days. They're
wandering out of the woods and into the suburbs _ where they have
been known to break into houses, surprise backyard barbecuers and
generally wreak havoc. With the number of bear sightings _ and
encounters _ on the rise, it's time to brush up on your
``bear-proofing'' skills and learn what to do if you come
face-to-face with a 500-pound grizzly.)

<P>
   There are about 650,000 black bears in North America, and only
one person every three years is killed by a bear _ although there
are hundreds of thousands of encounters. Most bears in the
continental United States are black bears, but black bears are not
always black in color: Sometimes their fur is brown or blond. Males
are generally bigger than females (125 pounds to 500 pounds for
males, 90 pounds to 300 pounds for females).
</P>
<P>
   Bears can run as fast as horses, uphill or downhill. They can
also climb trees.
</P>
<P>
   Bears have excellent senses of smell and hearing _ and they're
extremely strong. They can tear cars apart looking for food.
</P>
<P>
   Every bear defends a ``personal space.'' The extent of this
space will vary with each bear and each situation; it may be a few
feet or a few hundred feet. Intrusion into this space is considered
a threat and may provoke an attack.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to know that bears aggressively defend their
food. Stay away from dead animals because bears may attack to
defend such food.
</P>
<P>
   Female bears defend their cubs. If a female with cubs is
surprised at close range or is separated from her cubs, she may
attack.
 &UR; WHAT TO DO IF YOU SEE A BEAR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Make your presence known by talking loudly, clapping, singing
or calling out. Whatever you do, make sure you are heard. It does
not pay to surprise a bear.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep children close at hand.
</P>
<P>
   _ There is no guaranteed minimum safe distance from a bear _ the
farther, the better.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are in a car, remain in your vehicle. Do not get out,
even for a quick photo. Keep your windows up. Do not impede the
bear from crossing the road.
 &UR; HOW TO ESCAPE FROM A BEAR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If a bear is threatening you:
</P>
<P>
   _ Lie still and quiet. Documented attacks show that an attack by
a mother black bear often ends when the person stops fighting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stay where you are. Don't try to climb a tree to escape. Black
bears can climb trees easily and will come after you. The odds are
that the bear will leave you alone if you stay put.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are lying still and the bear attacks, strike back with
anything you can. Go for the bear's eyes or its snout.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: HOW TO AVOID AN ATTACK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Reduce or eliminate food odors from yourself, your camp, your
clothes and your vehicle. Don't sleep in the same clothes you cook
in.
</P>
<P>
   _ Store food so that bears cannot smell it or reach it. Do not
keep food in your tent _ not even a chocolate bar.
</P>
<P>
   _ Properly store and dispose of all garbage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Handle and store pet food with as much care as your own.

 `HE'S GOT A GUN!' HOW TO SURVIVE 
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: A quick scan of recent headlines will tell you
something you may not want to know: Random shootings are becoming
more and more common. Would you know what to do if you suddenly
found yourself in the line of fire? This excerpt from ``The
WORST-CASE SCENARIO Survival Handbook'' offers strategies to help
you avoid becoming a victim.)

 WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE A PRIMARY TARGET  
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Get as far away as possible. An untrained shooter isn't likely
to be accurate at any distance greater than 60 feet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Run fast, but don't move in a straight line. Weave back and
forth to make it more difficult for the shooter to draw a bead on
you. The average shooter will not have the training necessary to
hit a moving target at any real distance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't bother to count shots. You will have no idea if the
shooter has more ammunition. Counting is only for the movies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Turn a corner as quickly as you can, particularly if your
pursuer has a rifle or assault weapon. Rifles have much greater
accuracy and range, and the person may be more likely to either aim
or spray bullets in your direction.
 &UR; WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE NOT A PRIMARY TARGET &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Get down, and stay down.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the intended target is near you or if the shooter is firing
at random, get as low as possible. Do not crouch down; get flat on
your stomach and stay there.
</P>
<P>
   If you are outside and can get to a car, run to it and lie
behind a tire on the opposite side of the car from the shooter. If
no cars are present, lie in the gutter next to the curb. A car will
stop or deflect a small-caliber bullet fired toward you. However,
higher caliber bullet _ such as those from an assault rifle or
bullets that are designed to pierce armor _ can easily penetrate a
car and hit someone on the opposite side.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are inside a building and the shooter is inside, get to
another room and lie flat. If you cannot get to another room, move
behind a heavy, thick object (a solid desk, a filing cabinet, a
table, a couch) for protection.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are face-to-face with the shooter, do anything you can
to make yourself less of a target. Turn sideways, and stay low _
stray bullets are likely to be at least a few feet above the
ground. If the shooter is outside, stay inside and stay away from
doors and windows.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stay down until the shooting stops or until authorities arrive
and give the all clear. Attempt to keep large objects between you
and the shooter.

 CAN IT STRIKE TWICE? WHY YOU SHOULD WATCH OUT FOR LIGHTNING 
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Summer is the season for thunderstorms _ complete
with dangerous lightning. Lightning causes more casualties annually
in the United States than any other storm-related phenomenon except
floods. No place is completely safe from lightning, but some are
more dangerous than others. This excerpt from ``The Worst-Case
Scenario Survival Handbook'' explains how to avoid being struck.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Lightning causes more casualties annually in the United States
than any other storm-related phenomenon except floods. No place is
completely safe from lightning. However, some places are more
dangerous than others.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to avoid being struck:
</P>
<P>
   _ Loud or frequent thunder indicates that lightning activity is
approaching. If you can see lightning and/or hear thunder, you are
at risk. High winds, rainfall and cloud cover often act as
precursors to actual cloud-to-ground strikes. Thunderstorms
generally move west to east and occur late in the day or in early
evening when humidity is highest.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you see lightning, count the number of seconds until
thunder is heard and then divide by five. This will indicate how
far the storm is from you in miles. If the time delay between
seeing the flash (lightning) and hearing the boom (thunder) is
fewer than 30 seconds, seek a safer location immediately.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid high places, open fields and ridges above the
timberline. If in an open area, do not lie flat; kneel with your
hands on the ground and your head low.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid isolated trees, unprotected gazebos and rain or picnic
shelters, as well as shallow depressions in the earth. Current
traveling through the ground may use you to bridge the depression.
Also avoid baseball dugouts, communications towers, flagpoles,
light poles, metal and wood bleachers and metal fences. If you are
camping, avoid your tent if it is in an open area or under a large
tree.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stay away from oceans, lakes, swimming pools, rivers and other
bodies of water.
</P>
<P>
   _ Large enclosed buildings tend to be much safer than smaller or
open structures. The risk for lightning injury depends on whether
the structure incorporates lightning protection, the construction
materials used and the size of the structure.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fully enclosed metal vehicles such as cars, trucks, buses and
vans, with the windows rolled up, provide good shelter from
lightning. Avoid contact with metal or conducting surfaces outside
or inside the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   _ When inside, avoid contact with conductive surfaces with
exposure to the outside, including the sink, plumbing fixtures, and
metal door and window frames.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid outlets, electrical cords and wired electrical devices,
including telephones.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wait for the storm to pass. The lightning threat generally
diminishes with time after the last sound of thunder, but may
persist for more than 30 minutes. When thunderstorms are in the
area but not overhead, the lightning threat can exist even when it
is sunny, not raining, or when clear sky is visible.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; OPTIONAL SIDEBAR: HOW TO TREAT SOMEONE STRUCK BY LIGHTNING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Call 911 to report the strike and give directions to emergency
personnel. With immediate medical treatment, victims can survive an
encounter with lightning. If multiple people have been struck,
treat the apparently ``dead'' first. People who are unconscious but
still breathing will probably recover on their own.
</P>
<P>
   _ Move to a safer location to avoid getting struck yourself. It
is unusual for victims who survive a lightning strike to have major
fractures that would cause paralysis or major bleeding
complications unless they have suffered a fall or been thrown a
distance. Do not be afraid to move the victim rapidly if necessary;
individuals struck by lightning do not carry a charge and it is
safe to touch them to give medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   _ In cold and wet environments, put a protective layer between
the victim and the ground to decrease the chance of hypothermia,
which can further complicate resuscitation. Check for burns,
especially around jewelry and watches.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the victim is not breathing, start mouth-to mouth
resuscitation. Give one breath every 5 seconds. If moving the
victim, give a few quick breaths prior to moving.
</P>
<P>
   _ Determine if the victim has a pulse. Check the pulse at the
carotid artery (side of the neck) or femoral artery (groin) for at
least 20 to 30 seconds. If no pulse is detected, start cardiac
compressions. If the pulse returns, continue ventilation with
rescue breathing as needed for as long as practical in a wilderness
situation.
</P>
<P>
   _ If a pulse does not return after 20 to 30 minutes of good
effort, stop resuscitation efforts. In wilderness areas far from
medical care, prolonged basic CPR is of little use _ the victim is
unlikely to recover if they do not respond within the first few
minutes.

 CAUGHT IN A `TITANIC' SITUATION? HOW TO SURVIVE ADRIFT AT SEA 
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: It happened to Elian Gonzalez, and it could happen
to you. You're far from shore when suddenly the boat you are in
capsizes and sinks _ and you find yourself adrift at sea. How do
you stay alive? This excerpt from ``The WORST-CASE SCENARIO
Survival Handbook'' offers tips that can help you save yourself.) 
 (Includes B&AMP;W illustration of objects that can be used to signal
for help. CREDIT: ILLLUSTRATION BY BRENDA BROWN.) 
 By JOSHUA PIVEN and DAVID BORGENICHT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Stay aboard your boat as long as possible before you get into
a life raft. In a maritime emergency, the rule of thumb is that you
should step up into your raft, meaning you should be up to your
waist in water before you get into the raft.
</P>
<P>
   Your best chance of survival is on a boat _ even a disabled one
_ not on a life raft. But if the boat is sinking, know how to use a
life raft.
</P>
<P>
   Any craft that sails in open water (a boat larger than 14 feet)
should have at least one life raft. Smaller boats may only have
life jackets, so these vessels should stay within easy swimming
distance of land.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the boat is sinking, get in the life raft _ and take
whatever supplies you can carry. Most importantly, take fresh
water. Do not drink seawater. A person can last for several days
without food at sea, but without clean water to drink, death is a
virtual certainty within several days.
</P>
<P>
   Many canned foods, particularly vegetables, are packed in water,
so take those with you if you can. Do not ration water; drink it as
needed _ but don't drink more than is necessary. A half-gallon a
day should be sufficient if you limit your activity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prolonged exposure to saltwater can damage your skin and cause
lesions, which are prone to infection. Stay covered. Modern life
rafts have canopies, which protect passengers from sun, wind and
rain. If the canopy is missing or damaged, wear a hat, long sleeves
and pants to protect yourself from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   _ Find food, if you can. Life rafts include fishing hooks in
their survival kit. If no hook is available you can fashion one
using wire or even shards of aluminum from an empty can.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try to get to land, if you know where it is. Most rafts
include small paddles, but life rafts are not very maneuverable,
especially in any wind above 3 knots. Do not exhaust yourself _ you
won't be able to move any significant distance without great
effort.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you see a plane or boat nearby, try to signal it. Use a VHF
radio or a handheld flare kit. A small mirror can also be used for
signaling.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; OPTIONAL SIDEBAR: HOW TO PREPARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Never go out on a boat unprepared. Most boats should have at
least one type of emergency signaling device, which is called an
Emergency Position Radio Beacon, or EPiRB. These devices send out
global marine distress signals and come in two forms: 406 MHz and
125 MHz. Both will send your boat identification and position, but
the 406 goes to other ships, passing airplanes and satellites,
while the 125 only goes to ships and planes. People without one of
these devices can drift for months before they are found.
</P>
<P>
   Always carry a ``go bag'' that contains:
</P>
<P>
   _ Warm, dry clothes and blanket
</P>
<P>
   _ A hat
</P>
<P>
   _ Food (canned goods, backpacking foods, dried fruit)
</P>
<P>
   _ A handheld VHF radio
</P>
<P>
   _ A small, handheld GPS (Global Positioning Satellite) tracking
unit
</P>
<P>
   _ Drinking water in portable jugs

<P>
   _ A compass

   _ A flashlight with extra batteries

 DIDN'T ENJOY `JAWS'? HERE'S HOW TO FEND OFF A SHARK 
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: The movie ``Jaws'' made scores of beach-goers
afraid to dip even a big toe into the water. If you're among the
leery, you'll want to read this guide to avoiding sharks _ and what
to do if you are attacked. Even if you're not afraid, you may want
to take a peek at this excerpt from ``The WORST-CASE SCENARIO
Survival Handbook'' before diving into the waves _ because, hey,
you just never know.)  
 (Includes B&AMP;W illustration of a shark. CREDIT: ILLUSTRATION BY
BRENDA BROWN.) 
 By JOSHUA PIVEN and DAVID BORGENICHT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most shark attacks occur in waters near the shore, typically
inshore of a sandbar or between sandbars where sharks feed and can
become trapped at low tide. Areas with steep drop-offs are also
likely attack sites. Sharks congregate in these areas, because
their natural prey congregates there.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any large shark, roughly 6 feet or longer, is a potential
threat to humans. But three species in particular have repeatedly
attacked man: the white shark, the tiger shark and the bull shark.
All are cosmopolitan in distribution, reach large sizes and
regularly consume large prey such as marine mammals, sea turtles
and fish.
 &UR; HOW TO AVOlD AN ATTACK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Always stay in groups. Sharks are more likely to attack an
individual.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't wander too far from shore. This isolates you and creates
the additional danger of being too far from assistance. Avoid being
in the water during darkness or twilight hours, when sharks are
most active and have a competitive sensory advantage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't enter the water if you are bleeding from an open wound
or if you are menstruating. A shark is drawn to blood and its sense
of smell is acute.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try not to wear shiny jewelry, because the reflected light
resembles the sheen of fish scales.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid waters being used by sport or commercial fishermen,
especially if there are signs of bait fish or feeding activity.
Diving seabirds are good indicators of such activity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use extra caution when waters are murky, and avoid showing
uneven tan lines or wearing brightly colored clothing. Sharks see
contrast particularly well.
</P>
<P>
   _ If a shark shows itself to you, it may be curious rather than
predatory and will probably swim on and leave you alone. If you are
under the surface and lucky enough to see an attacking shark, you
have a good chance of defending yourself if the shark is not too
large.
 &UR; WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE ATTACKED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Hit back. If a shark attacks you, use anything you have in
your possession _ a camera, probe, your fist _ to hit the shark's
eyes or gills, which are the areas most sensitive to pain.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make quick, sharp, repeated jabs in these areas. Sharks are
predators and will usually only follow through on an attack if they
have the advantage, so making the shark unsure of its advantage in
any way possible will increase your chances of survival. Contrary
to popular opinion, the shark's nose is not the area to attack,
unless you cannot reach the eyes or gills.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; OPTIONAL SIDEBAR: THREE KINDS OF SHARK ATTACKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``HIT AND RUN'' &LR;  attacks are by far the most common. These
typically occur in the surf zone, where swimmers and surfers are
the targets. The victim seldom sees its attacker, and the shark
does not return after inflicting a single bite or slash wound.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``BUMP AND BITE'' &LR;  attacks are characterized by the shark
initially circling and often bumping the victim prior to the actual
attack. These types of attacks usually involve divers or swimmers
in deeper waters, but also occur in near shore shallows in some
areas of the world.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ``SNEAK'' &LR;  attacks differ: The strike can occur without
warning. With both ``bump and bite'' and ``sneak'' attacks, repeat
attacks are common and multiple and sustained bites are the norm.
Injuries incurred during this type of attack are usually quite
severe, frequently resulting in death

TIKI GODS EMERGE AND JOIN THE LUAU 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK DeCARO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It rises like a giant war canoe, a pair of tiki gods flanking
its front door, flames lapping the dusk from a red pot atop each
stone head. Inside, a cloud of dry ice billows from the
rum-and-fruit-juice drinks known as Smoking Eruptions. A gong
sounds, a maiden appears, a macaw shifts on its perch, then
lightning flashes. So much excitement, and the Samoan Flaming
Chicken hasn't even been served yet.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Kahiki. Port of call: Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The grandest and best preserved of a nearly extinct form of
culinary recreation _ the Polynesian-style supper club of the 1950s
and '60s _ this tropical restaurant is a vintage postcard from the
South Seas, across from a Kmart. It is a painstaking hybrid of
Disneyland's ``Enchanted Tiki Room,'' ``Gilligan's Island'' and the
Chinese restaurants that thrived when ``exotic'' meant water
chestnuts and sweet-and-sour sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Opened in 1962 and placed on the National Register of Historic
Places in 1997, Kahiki has been a real survivor _ until now.
Occupying a choice retail site, it will close on Aug. 26, to make
way for a Walgreens.
</P>
<P>
   While preservationists labor to save Kahiki, the luau goes on
elsewhere. After a decade of bubbling under pop culture's crust
like a subterranean lava pool, tiki is back. It's all happening
now: Surfing, the revival of Hawaiian shirts, lounge music and
tropical merchandise that Trader Vic's would have adored.
</P>
<P>
   There are tiki coasters, tiki-patterned boxer shorts, a magazine
called Tiki News, even a ``Tiki Type'' font kit from House
Industries that allows 21st century party-givers to print
'50s-style luau invitations on their iMacs. Several new books
include the most comprehensive look at the trend, ``In Search of
Tiki: A Guide for the Urban Archeologist,'' by Sven Kirsten
(Taschen).
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, when he began collecting mugs shaped like
primitive gods, ``tiki was considered ugly,'' Kirsten said. ``You
could get a tiki mug for a buck, not like now on eBay,'' he said.
(One from a 1961 screening of Elvis Presley's ``Blue Hawaii'' sold
for nearly $1,000 on the Internet late last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Josh Agle, an artist who paints tiki style, began collecting
tikis about 12 years ago when he first began frequenting tiki bars.
``It started with taking home souvenir mugs,'' he said. ``It was so
cool, because it was like stepping back in time when you went to
these bars.''
</P>
<P>
   He has recreated the ambience of those bars at home in Orange,
Calif. ``It's kind of high maintenance because tikis are dust
collectors,'' he said. ``But people like the UPS guy are pretty
impressed, even though he doesn't know what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating a spate of Polynesian style parties among 30- to
40-year-olds this spring, Macy's East division opened a ``Patio
Luau'' department with plastic plates patterned with hibiscus
flowers. The shops themselves were festooned with Easter Island
tiki heads and palm trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year we really felt that everything in the fashion market
was gearing toward the return of pattern,'' said Joe Denofrio, a
senior vice president for fashion at Macy's East. ``We felt that if
people are interested in florals for apparel, they'd be feeling the
same about their summer entertaining. You can picture yourself out
on your patio in floral board shorts, with a lantern and some great
floral serving trays. A tiki is really a natural component there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sur La Table, the Seattle-based kitchenware retailer better
known for Moroccan tea glasses than mai tai mugs, put ceramic tiki
tumblers on the cover of its summer catalog. Likewise, at the
trend-savvy Old Navy, tiki masks are embroidered on camp shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it's part of that whole vintage fun retro feel,'' said
Joe Enos, a spokesman for Old Navy. ``Everything has a wink to
it.'' Enos got his first taste of tiki in the '60s at a restaurant
called the Coral Reef in Sacramento, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Although Quiksilver, Tommy Bahama and other surf-inspired
fashion lines have long mined tiki iconography, many mainstream
designers have caught the wave this season, from Bloomingdale's and
J.Crew to Ralph Lauren, who is serving up T-shirts printed with the
image of a wooden tiki idol on whose base had been carved the word
``Polo.''
</P>
<P>
   Stranger still is the cross-pollination of hip-hop and tiki from
a line called Mecca. The company's hot-colored T-shirts are
silk-screened with Easter Island tiki heads.
</P>
<P>
   Partygoers, Denofrio said of Macy's, are doing it their own way.
``It's multicultural and it goes every way from the South Seas to
Southeast Asia,'' he said. ``It's all things exotic.''
</P>
<P>
   The glut of new tiki merchandise, said Otto von Stroheim, the
founder of Tiki News, ``has created the ability for more people to
have fun in the tiki scene.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: xxxx. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tiki was not originally an underground movement, he pointed out.
``Before, it wasn't that hip anyway,'' he said. ``It was always
very mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Stern, whose numerous books on pop culture, written with
wife, Jane, include the seminal The Encyclopedia of Bad Taste, is,
of course, a fan of tiki. ``What's so wonderful about tiki is that
it allows us to wallow in a vernacular that's so ersatz,'' he said.
``It's sort of a twice-removed fascination. There was a time when
Trader Vic's was considered by sophisticated people to be true
exotica. The fascination is that it still exists in that totally
bogus form.'' His own favorite Polynesian restaurant was the
Hukilau, near Hartford, which is now defunct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Americans crave play, but there's so much seriousness in
food and entertainment. But you can't do that with Polynesian
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten understands completely. The German-born, Los
Angeles-based cinematographer is an authority on the ``Polynesian
Pop'' movement in art and design. His lavishly illustrated book,
the fruit of two decades of collecting, is due from Taschen later
this year. It celebrates tiki's golden years.
</P>
<P>
   Polynesia's moment in mainland America spanned from just after
World War II, when soldiers first brought home aloha shirts and
Hawaiian tourism took off, through the early '60s era of Annette
Funicello's ``Pineapple Princess'' and the series ``Hawaiian Eye.''
By the time ``Hawaii Five-O'' rounded up the last villain in 1980,
tiki was dead, a trend that had become stiffer than Jack Lord's
hair.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kirsten concedes that tiki aficionados are rare
compared with, say, Fiestaware collectors, he says restaurants like
Kahiki need to take their place in pop culture history. ``The
typical thing at such restaurants was to invite people from the
audience to go onstage and dance the hula and make fools of
themselves. There's always a need for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately only a handful of tiki-toriums remain: The
Mai-Kai, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., luau restaurant where hula shows
are still performed; the Tonga Room, a watering hole with indoor
thunderstorms in San Francisco's Fairmont Hotel, and the Hala
Kahiki bar in River Grove, Ill., where everything that isn't tiki
is leopard print.
</P>
<P>
   At Lee's Hawaiian Islander in Lyndhurst, N.J., on a recent
Saturday night not much had changed from the nostalgic scenario
Kirsten describes. At the restaurant, Michael Doneff, the owner of
Nice House, a Greenwich Village design store, was the host of a
friend's 40th birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have booths that look like thatched-roof huts,'' he said.
``They have a whole wall of fake lava rock with plastic bouquets
stuck in it. We had pu pu platters and flaming drinks. It was just
kind of goofy.''
</P>
<P>
   While bamboo is considered chic among the tastemakers who
frequent his shop, Doneff says, its tiki-tacky counterparts are hip
again, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger kids are finding it cool,'' he said. ``You see things
like paper lanterns at Urban Outfitters and Restoration Hardware
and you just get in the mood to hang lights and sip something out
of a plastic pineapple.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Low-flying 527s shot down
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate have acted on the notion that those
newly popular but secretive groups known as 527s should be forced
to say who is paying for their TV spots and other political
activities. The House voted 385-39 early today to require
disclosure of groups that organize under section 527 of the tax
code, which allows nonprofit groups to run campaign-style ads as
long as they don't directly advocate the election or defeat of any
candidate. The Senate passed a similar measure earlier this month,
and the two chambers now must work out the differences
</P>
<P>
   THESE DONORS AREN'T 527S
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush knows how to throw a breakfast. By offering
scrambled eggs at the River Club overlooking the East River in
Manhattan, he was able to extract $3 million from about 55 donors
for the Republican National Committee. Neither the campaign nor the
committee would identify any of the people at the event. The
location was kept secret from reporters until the event was over.
Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman, said private events were, well,
private. This also applied to a lunch for Bush in Cleveland today,
where each couple paid $25,000 and the RNC raised about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   TO ENABLE THE DISABLED
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush proposed today $145 million in federal spending
to help local governments and community groups make it easier for
people with disabilities to find jobs and travel to them. ``It's
one thing to have technologies to help people help themselves,'' he
said at Vocational Guidance Services in Cleveland, a nonprofit
organization that helps disabled people find work. ``But sometimes
people have trouble getting from one place to the other.'' Bush
said his proposal would better enable the disabled to live
independently and hold jobs.
</P>
<P>
   BREAKS FOR `GREEN' DRIVING AND LIVING
</P>
<P>
   Consumers would get tax credits of up to $6,000 for buying
electric cars and $2,000 for energy-efficient new homes under a
campaign proposal today by Al Gore. He outlined his proposals,
which would cost more than $48 billion over 10 years, at a home in
Columbus, Ohio, featuring the newest energy-saving technologies.
``The best innovations are of little use if they are stuck in a lab
_ unaffordable and unattainable to you, your family or your
business,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   WITH A SMILE AND A HANDSHAKE AND A SHINE ON HIS SHOES
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush accused Al Gore today of coddling big oil
companies by proposing that deep-water drillers continue to get a
break on fees despite soaring fuel prices. Gore, who often
criticizes Bush as a friend of big oil, had called for an extension
of the royalty moratorium as part of his 10-year plan for nurturing
new energy technologies. A day earlier in Michigan, Bush said that
as president he would bring down gasoline prices through sheer
force of personality, by creating enough political good will with
oil-producing nations that they would increase their supply of
crude: ``I would work with our friends in OPEC to convince them to
open up the spigot, to increase the supply.''
</P>
<P>
   A GORE WARNING TO WOMEN
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore said the ``razor-thin'' majority in today's Supreme
Court decision affirming abortion rights shows what is at stake for
women in the presidential election. Gore pointed to the 5-4
decision, noted that his opponent, George W. Bush, opposes abortion
rights _ with a reminder: ``Now here's the point: The next
president will nominate at least three and probably four _ perhaps
four _ justices to the Supreme Court. One extra vote on the wrong
side of those two issues would change the outcome and a woman's
right to choose would be taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   LIBERTARIAN CONVENTION GOING LIVE
</P>
<P>
   Some 14,000 delegates from all 50 states are expected at the
Libertarian National Convention this weekend in Anaheim, Calif.
C-SPAN will cover it live, beginning at noon both Saturday and
Sunday. Saturday night's coverage includes a presidential debate
with candidates Harry Browne, Dave Hollist, Don Gorman and Barry
Hess. The convention's opening remarks will be delivered by
nationally syndicated radio talk show host Neil Boortz.
</P>
<P>
   INCUMBENT GOES DOWN IN UTAH
</P>
<P>
   Dogged by accusations about his temper and alleged delusional
behavior, Utah Rep. Merrill Cook lost his bid for a third House
term. He's just the second incumbent _ and first Republican _ to
lose in a primary this year. Political newcomer Derek Smith, a
computer company founder, easily won the primary. Smith faces
Democrat Jim Matheson in November. The only other incumbent to lose
in a primary this year was nine-term Democratic Rep. Matthew
Martinez of California.
</P>
<P>
   AGGRIEVED WIFE TRIUMPHS
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, two-term Republican state Rep. Shirley Hinson
captured 52 percent of the vote to win a bitter race against her
estranged husband, retired school principal Jimmy Hinson. She has
no Democratic opposition in November. The race was steeped in the
details of the Hinsons' troubled marriage, including allegations of
death threats and infidelity. In the race for retiring GOP Rep.
Mark Sanford's House seat, state Rep. Henry Brown beat former state
Transportation Chairman H.B. ``Buck'' Limehouse for the right to
face Democrat Andy Brack.
</P>
<P>
   PEROT _ YES, HE'S STILL AROUND
</P>
<P>
   Salon, the online magazine, reports that ``allies''of Reform
Party candidate Pat Buchanan ``were scrambling amid growing
speculation'' that party founder Ross Perot, who just turned 70,
would allow his name to be entered as a candidate for the party's
presidential nomination just before the deadline this Saturday.
Perot spokeswoman Donna Donovan said an announcement would be
coming soon, and ``the Buchanans are right to be worried.''
</P>
<P>
   EXCEPTION TAKEN TO SPOKESMAN'S SPEAKING
</P>
<P>
   Top Republicans criticized Al Gore's campaign spokesman for
comparing a GOP senator's decision to release Justice Department
information about the vice president to ``McCarthyite tactics.''
George W. Bush said it appeared the aide, Chris Lehane, ``got a
little carried away,'' and Arlen Specter, the senator in question,
sent a terse letter to Gore seeking an explanation and ``prompt
apology.''
</P>
<P>
   STICKING WITH THE EMBARGO
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush rejected an effort by House Republicans to allow
American food into Cuba for the first time since the economic
embargo began four decades ago, saying that Fidel Castro might
block it from reaching those who need it. His comments came after
House Republicans _ who Bush said had ``good intentions'' _ cut a
deal to permit direct sales of U.S. food to Cuba as hard-line
anti-communists yielded to pressure from the farm and business
lobbies.
</P>
<P>
   THE LONG-TERM SOLUTION
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is offering what he hopes will be a balm to drivers
pinched by steep gas prices: a ``no new taxes, no new
bureaucracies'' energy policy that does nothing about today's
prices but aims to cut oil dependence in the long term. The 10-year
package Gore outlined centered on $75 billion in tax incentives for
the development and use of fuel-efficient and nonpolluting
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   HISPANIC CLOUT IN BIG STATES
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore leads George W. Bush by 22 points among Hispanic voters,
says a survey taken by Miami pollster Sergio Bendixen. But Bush is
running about even with Gore in the South, based largely on the
Republican sentiments of Cuban-Americans in Florida and the Texas
governor's appeal to Mexican-Americans in his home state. Hispanic
voters are more heavily concentrated in the four biggest states:
California (13 percent), Texas (20 percent), New York (9 percent)
and Florida (12 percent).
</P>
<P>
   NOTHING TO FEAR BUT _
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Hillary Clinton's intensified criticism in recent
weeks, Rick Lazio accused her of waging a campaign based on fear
and warned that her latest TV spots attacking his record would
backfire. ``I know what these attack ads are all about,'' Lazio
said in Manhattan. ``They're about fear.'' He added, ``If these
attacks continue, my opponent will learn this about New York: Bend
the truth, and you will face the consequences. New Yorkers will not
elect a person they cannot trust.'' Clinton had been criticizing
Lazio's votes in Congress and his positions on guns, abortion and
education financing.
</P>
<P>
   TAKE TWO AND HIT TO RIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton has taken a lot of flack over her claim to be a
lifelong New York Yankee fan _ and now, even her past rooting for
her native state's Chicago Cubs is costing her. The New York Post
reports that Jerry Reinsdorf, owner of the White Sox _ Chicago's
other team _ will host a fund-raiser for Rick Lazio on Friday in
his Comiskey Park skybox _ a payback for Clinton's Cubs allegiance.
In case anyone's wondering, Lazio's a Mets fan.
</P>
<P>
   WAITING _ LIKE THE MAYTAG REPAIRMAN
</P>
<P>
   It's far from clear just how much of a role President Clinton
will get to play in coming months. Senior campaign strategists have
made known their desire to limit Clinton's public role at the
August convention, so as not to steal the spotlight from Al Gore.
But Clinton seems to be waiting for the phone to ring. He has even
cleared his official calendar for that entire week _ just in case.
</P>
<P>
   PREPPING FOR THE CONFRONTATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Some advance anxiety is on display in Philadelphia, five weeks
before the Republican convention, as organizers of a protest march
are saying that police are tracking their plans and photographing
them. Some groups have promised extensive protests and possible
civil disobedience, while police officials have promised to keep
the city orderly for the conventioneers. ``The Secret Service, the
FBI, the Justice Department and the Philadelphia police have all
videotaped our news conferences,'' said Mike Morrill, one of the
organizers of the Unity 2000 protest march planned for July 31, the
eve of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   CARVILLE KENTUCKY WINDAGE
</P>
<P>
   James Carville, the former campaign adviser and chief defender
of President Clinton, will be advising Kentucky Democrats on how to
regain the state Senate, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader.
Carville will be holding a seminar for Kentucky Democratic senators
and candidates at the party's state headquarters in what state
Democratic Chairman David Boswell called a ``one-day private
briefing and critique, and not a fund-raiser.''

COUNTING DOWN FOR THE RELEASE OF THE NEW HARRY POTTER BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REBEKAH DENN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Security guards. Slumber parties. Lightning-bolts. Threats.
</P>
<P>
   They're all part of the fever building to July 8 when ``Harry
Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' the latest in the madly popular
Harry Potter series of children's books, goes on sale.
</P>
<P>
   In a mix of fun, hype and Windows 95-type marketing, bookstores
are holding midnight Potter parties and other celebrations to kick
off the latest in the young orphan's adventures at the Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   To date, we've seen Harry freed from the beastly grip of his
Muggle (non-magical) relatives to discover friendships, final exams
in classes like ``Defense Against the Dark Arts,'' and nail-biting
battles between good and evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the anticipation. I think it's great,'' said Christy
McDanold, owner of Secret Garden Bookshop in Seattle, which will
open at midnight July 7 to break out Book Four. ``I'm so glad that
kids are so excited about a book.''
</P>
<P>
   To get their shipments in time for H-Day, bookstore owners had
to sign affidavits pledging they wouldn't sell the book any earlier
than 12:01 a.m. July 8. Kiddie book publisher Scholastic Inc.
threatened to cut off future Potter shipments to anyone who sells
the book early.
</P>
<P>
   Security is so tight that online bookseller Amazon.com, which
already has the books in its warehouses, has hired extra guards to
protect them. And the limited number of employees selected to
package the books were told to divulge no details about the book to
co-workers and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a need-to-know, need-to-see basis,'' said Lyn Blake,
general manager of the Amazon.com bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   (If you really do need to know, though, check out the latest
tidbits at www.harrypotterfans.net, a comprehensive Potterania
source that learned and posted the title when it was still
officially top secret. The Webmaster promises that no major plot
spoilers will be posted.)
</P>
<P>
   The widespread anticipation _ not to mention the record-setting
3.8 million print run _ is an exponential jump from even the hotly
awaited third book by author J.K. Rowling, which was released last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The first three books were published in Britain first, then the
United States. Determined fans ordered foreign editions and diluted
the mass hunger for the books here. To even the playing field,
Scholastic decided to release Book Four on the same day in both
countries. It has been a best-seller even in pre-orders for the
past few months.
</P>
<P>
   It's rare for bookstores to have such a marquee release, one
whose appeal crosses generations and genres. Though technically a
children's fantasy, booksellers report legions of fans of all ages
and types.
</P>
<P>
   The first three books have hogged The New York Times best-seller
list so long _ rankling the literary lions of Serious Fiction _
that the paper announced plans last week to create a separate
children's best-seller list in anticipation of Book Four.
</P>
<P>
   No word yet on whether they'll create a separate Harry Potter
best-seller list when all seven books planned for the series are
published.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of so many book sales has also fueled the feud
between independent booksellers and online giant Amazon, reaching
intense Gryffindor vs. Slytherin levels.
</P>
<P>
   The bookstores initially thought they had the edge in the Potter
Wars, saying they would be the first to provide Book Four to
customers, even if they couldn't match Amazon's 40 percent discount
off the book's hefty $25.95 cover price.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a move that infuriated several independents, Amazon
announced it had worked out deals with Scholastic and Federal
Express to get the book early enough to package its massive
pre-orders in envelopes that would be ready to go at 12:01 a.m.
July 8. Furthermore, it announced a free upgrade to same-day
Saturday deliveries for the first 250,000 books ordered, a goal it
reached earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's Blake won't say how much the free upgrades cost the
company, but she said the customer goodwill it has generated is
more than worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken all kinds of e-mail (saying) `You don't know what
this means to our family,''' she said. ``I'm also sure we're
getting new customers in by making this an easy-to-purchase book.''

 &HT;    Q: I have to hang several new custom-made wood doors.
 &HT;    Previously, I have had trouble using a wood chisel to cut the
shallow mortises needed for installing the door hinges. My chisel
blade always seemed to dig in too deeply and sometimes split the
wood.
 &HT;    Can you offer some tips on the correct way to use a wood chisel
for shallow cuts?
 &HT;    A: The most important point to remember is that the chisel must
be very sharp, with a blade that is not nicked or otherwise
damaged.
 &HT;    Draw the outline of the mortise onto the edge of the door with a
sharp pencil then use the chisel to cut around this outline by
tapping it with a mallet to make vertical cuts down into the wood.
 &HT;    Start removing the wood inside this outline by forcing the
chisel in from the side (as shown in the illustration). You can
also do this by working from the center of the outline out toward
the cuts just made.
 &HT;    If possible, push the chisel by hand without using a mallet and
cut with the grain (so that the grain slopes up toward the cutting
end of the blade).
 &HT;    Hold the chisel with the bevel side down, not up, and remove
only a small layer at a time to avoid gouging.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: When I tried to replace the handle on my old sink faucet, the
screw that held the handle in place refused to budge.
 &HT;    I used a wrench on my screwdriver to apply added leverage, and
the end of the screw broke off, leaving only a short stub sticking
up.
 &HT;    What can I do to fix this without having to replace the entire
faucet?
 &HT;    A: Try applying a penetrating oil around the screw threads to
help free it up.
 &HT;    Wait a few minutes to let it penetrate and tap on the end of the
stub rapidly with the handle of your screwdriver. This will help
the oil penetrate further.
 &HT;    Wait 10 or 15 minutes, then firmly grip the stub that sticks up
with a Vise Grip or similar type of locking pliers and use this to
slowly unscrew and twist the rest of the screw out.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Our house has steam heat with old fashioned cast iron steam
radiators.
 &HT;    The radiators in our dining room are covered with decorative
wood covers that were installed by the previous owner and we want
to do the same for the radiators in the living room and bedroom.
 &HT;    Do you know where we can buy them?
 &HT;    A: Depending on the area where you live, radiator covers are
sometimes sold by lumber yards and home centers, as well by dealers
who sell unfinished furniture.
 &HT;    However, if you cannot find a local dealer who carries them,
then you should be able to have them made to order by any
woodworking shop or cabinet manufacturer who makes custom cabinets.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: The 100-year-old house we recently bought has a brick
foundation that was painted on the inside of the basement.
 &HT;    There is a white powder that seems to be working its way out
through the paint in many places where the paint has flaked off,
and there are even small layers of brick coming off in some spots.
 &HT;    What should we do about halting this damage and repairing the
brick?
 &HT;    A. The white powder you see is undoubtedly efflorescence, a
frequent problem on brick and masonry walls.
 &HT;    Although not a serious problem in most cases, this will depend
on how extensive the condition is.
 &HT;    I recommend calling in an experienced mason to examine the
foundation and determine just how extensive the damage really is _
and what repairs, if any, are needed.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to
Bernard Gladstone, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general
interest will be answered in this column; Mr. Gladstone regrets
that unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NOTE: Drawing captioned ``CUTTING A MORTISE'' goes with this
column.
 &HT;    CAPTION: Chisel is used with bevel side down when making shallow
cuts to keep the blade from digging too deeply into the wood with
each pass.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Was the American Civil War inevitable? Many popular histories,
like the epic television documentary by Ken Burns, portray the
conflict as an unavoidable corrective that rid a great nation of
slavery. But people of the 1850s and 1860s didn't see the issues
leading up to the war so clearly. According to letters, diaries,
newspapers and other records, many Northerners of the period
expressed support or sympathy for slavery, and many on both sides
longed for a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that Providence has raised up this nation to
such greatness and glory, to throw it away,'' a Southerner, Capt.
Samuel Brown Coyner, wrote on Jan. 4, 1861. Months later, however,
this man was fighting for the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward L. Ayers, a history professor at the University of
Virginia, has his own theories about what caused the Civil War. But
he doesn't want to give his version _ at least not yet. Instead, he
hopes that people will explore primary historical documents and
reach their own conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a small army of graduate students, Ayers has
spent the last eight years collecting and electronically scanning
more than 5,000 pages of diaries, photographs, newspaper articles,
church records, wills, military rosters, maps, census figures and
other documents from 1857 to 1870. He is trying to capture nearly
every document from two counties just 200 miles apart in the
Shenandoah Valley: Franklin County in Pennsylvania, in the North,
and Augusta County in Virginia, in the South. The two counties were
chosen as economically and socially representative of the two sides
in the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The archive, called ``The Valley of the Shadow: Two Communities
in the American Civil War,'' is available on the university's Web
site (valley.vcdh.virginia.edu), and a portion of it will be
published on CD-ROM by W.W. Norton &AMP; Co. this summer. The ``Valley
of the Shadow'' project amounts to a do-it-yourself history kit.
Instead of presenting a single narrative of the war, as a
traditional history book or documentary would, the archive allows
visitors to piece together stories on their own. Ayers called the
idea of making raw historical documents available electronically
``digital history.'' ``It changes history from a spectator sport to
a participant sport,'' he said. ``It's a move from looking at what
other people have thought of history to wrestling with its
complexities yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The raw nature of the archive can be frustrating for the
uninitiated, however, and can leave visitors longing for a guide to
help make sense of the minutiae. The archive exposes readers to
details of social life that are left out of most history books.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the personal writings deal with the mundane, like this
passage from the diary of an upper-class girl named Sarah Cordelia
Wright: ``Nothing has happened today worth relating, everything has
gone on as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are also moments of drama, as in a desperate letter
written by a slave named Maria Perkins to her husband to tell him
that ``my master has sold albert to a trader.'' She added that
``myself and other child is for sale also.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to tell dr Hamelton and your master if either will
buy me they can attend to it know and then I can go afterwards,''
she said. ``I dont want a trader to get me.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most powerful aspect of the archive, however, is
that it allows people to trace connections among the many kinds of
records. If a soldier is mentioned in one letter, for example,
someone could use the database to search for later census records
or other evidence to try to find out what happened to the soldier
after the war _ if he survived.
</P>
<P>
   The Web version of the archive, which has been online since
1995, is widely seen as one of the most successful experiments in
using the Internet as a tool for historical research. About 3
million people have visited the site. Some have used it for
research or for school assignments, while others have come to
discover facts about distant relatives. The university has set up
the Virginia Center for Digital History to assist similar projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's one of the path-breaking projects,'' said Dr.
Janice L. Reiff, an assistant professor of history at the
University of California at Los Angeles, who is writing a book
about projects like Ayers'. ``My hope is that digital history will
somehow demystify some of what we do. It may help to bridge that
distance between academic historians and the general public.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars have worried, however, that the ``Valley of the
Shadow'' project and others like it could lead people to overlook
other historical sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger would be that because of the attractiveness and
accessibility of it, students and historians might be tempted to
use this material and to overlook the less accessible kinds of
material from other parts of the country,'' said Dr. James M.
McPherson, a Princeton University history professor who wrote the
best-selling ``Battle Cry of Freedom'' (Oxford University Press,
1988). ``The danger in looking only at these two counties is one
misses an important part of the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayers has not always been interested in computers, or in the
Civil War. ``I resisted doing the Civil War for 20 years,'' he
said. Much of his academic work has focused on the social history
of the South, but he said that at the outset, the war itself was
less interesting to him than the stories of common people from the
19th century. Though he grew up in Tennessee and has a Southern
accent, he said his family does not have roots in the valley he is
now studying.
</P>
<P>
   At age 47, Ayers is emerging as a star scholar of the region.
His 1992 book, ``The Promise of the New South: Life After
Reconstruction'' (Oxford University Press), was a finalist for both
the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Ayers had originally planned to do the ``Valley of the Shadow''
research project the old-fashioned way. ``I was going to go over to
the archives myself and sit there in the courthouses and weave
together all these diverse materials,'' he said. But administrators
at the university were encouraging professors to find new uses for
computers in their research, in part because there was grant money
to be won for such projects. ``I was the only humanist that was
stupid enough to get involved,'' Ayers said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The project has involved more than 30 people, including the
CD-ROMS co-author, Dr. Anne S. Rubin, and the project's current
manager, Dr. William G. Thomas. To find money to support them all
and pay for their computer gear, Ayers had to become a salesman as
well as a scholar, pitching the project to potential donors. The
project has cost more than $450,000; financing has come from
sources like International Business Machines and the National
Endowment for the Humanities.
</P>
<P>
   When Ayers first conceived of the archive, he envisioned a
multimedia product that would include flashy visuals to help draw
in a general audience. But he and his research team ended up
limiting the number of graphics on the Web site to make sure that
people with old computers or slow connections could explore it.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM, which is due out in August, will deliver more of the
sights and sounds evocative of the era, including recordings of
period music, a scrapbook of images, narration by Ayers,
three-dimensional maps of the terrain and an interactive exhibition
of quilts. The disk will be packaged with a 112-page book by Ayers.
</P>
<P>
   The disk will contain only the first volume of the archive,
which is divided into three sections that document the periods
before, during and after the war. Norton plans to publish two more
CD-ROMs with the rest of the archive eventually. Translating the
archive from Web to disk proved more difficult than the researchers
originally thought, and technical problems have delayed the release
for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM will maintain the exploratory ethos of the site, and
it will even allow users to copy text from the archive into other
software applications. But you will not find any video clips of
Civil War re-enactors waging simulated skirmishes. ``This is all
real,'' Ayers said. ``This isn't people from today dressed up like
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayers said that the CD-ROM was an attempt to create a new kind
of popular history genre mixing multimedia and scholarship. ``Ours
is neither an encyclopedia nor a game,'' he said. ``But it is this
new thing, which is an interactive archive.''
</P>
<P>
   The professor has not given up on traditional scholarship,
though. He has nearly finished writing an academic book that will
present his version of what the ``Valley of the Shadow'' documents
reveal about the complexity of the war. ``The war was unpredictable
from start to finish, top to bottom, North to South,'' he said. It
was only through the leadership of Abraham Lincoln and others, he
said, that the war was turned into a moral battle against slavery.
``The story has grown smooth and domesticated from too much
handling. We need to reclaim its complexity, surprise and horror.''

ECONOMIC SCENE: ECONOMIC MODELS TO PREDICT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
  Hal R. Varian is an economics professor and dean of the School of
Information Management and Systems at the University of California
at Berkeley. 
 By HAL R. VARIAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Economics, the most imperialistic of the social sciences, is
always testing the borders of related fields. Several years ago
some economists invaded the territory of political science and
applied their expertise to election forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   Economics now offers two distinct approaches to predicting
election outcomes. One has its roots in macroeconomics, examining
how national economic performance affects voting. The other is
grounded in microeconomics, using a real financial market in which
participants can place their bets on the election results.
</P>
<P>
   Which approach is best? You can decide by using the Web sites
identified below.
</P>
<P>
   The first approach is most closely identified with the work of
Professor Ray Fair, a macroeconometrician at Yale who has examined
all two-party presidential elections since 1916. His most recent
forecasting model, which involves variables like the growth of
economic output, the inflation rate and whether a candidate is an
incumbent, has generated extremely accurate predictions: during the
period 1916-1992, his equation had only two elections wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Fair's model forecasts a narrow victory for Vice
President Al Gore, with 50.8 percent of the popular vote. But he
considers the election a tossup, and the prospects could change,
depending on what happens to the economy in the next few months.
Readers who want to see the implications of various economic
scenarios can visit the Web site at http://fairmodel.econ.yale.edu
and click on ``Predict the 2000 presidential elections'' to make
their own forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   A quite different approach to election forecasting has been
taken by some researchers at the Tippie College of Business at the
University of Iowa. On their Web site at
http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/index.html, you can buy and sell
political candidates _ not with campaign contributions, but by
participating in an online futures market in presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how it works. The Iowa Electronic Market has issued
securities for the Democratic, Reform and Republican parties that
are tied to the popular vote. If the Republican candidate, for
example, receives 52 percent of the popular vote, participants will
get a payoff of 52 cents for each Republican share they own on
election day.
</P>
<P>
   A security that will be worth 52 cents a little more than four
months from now should be worth slightly less than 52 cents today
because of the time value of money, so the current price at which
people are willing to buy and sell a Republican share should give a
pretty good forecast of the popular vote in November.
</P>
<P>
   As this column was being written, the forecasts were 48 percent
for the Democrats, 3.5 percent for the Reform Party and 48 percent
for the Republican Party _ a dead heat. If this stalemate
continues, it suggests that Reform Party voters and Green Party
voters may have a much bigger say in the November election than
most experts now forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa Electronic Markets involve real money, although the
maximum opening balance for a trading account is limited to $500.
And, yes, it is legal: the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has
ruled that as long as the IEM conforms to certain guidelines, the
commission will not intervene.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic market is operated by the researchers at the
University of Iowa as an economic experiment, with the goal of
better understanding speculative markets. As a side benefit, it has
ended up being a remarkably accurate predictor of presidential
elections, forecasting the correct outcome of every election since
1988. It even worked for the 1992 three-party race, which caused
virtually every other forecasting model to fail.
</P>
<P>
   As the election heats up, it will be fun to watch the ``market
response'' to various political events: convention speeches,
candidate missteps, and vice presidential choices. If you think you
can beat the market forecasts, you are welcome to try: the odds are
a lot better than at Las Vegas, and the share prices are a lot less
volatile than on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting thing about the Iowa market is what it
teaches us about how speculative markets work. Election forecasters
know that voters exhibit various sorts of biases in their responses
to polls. For example, Republicans and Democrats each tend to
overestimate the fraction of the popular vote that their party's
candidate will receive.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa market forecasts do not exhibit these biases, and the
question is: Why not? Most of the participants in the Iowa market
are college students and faculty. Perhaps these elite and highly
educated subjects are less susceptible to emotional attachments?
Alas, it is not so. When asked the same questions, the participants
in the Iowa markets tend to exhibit exactly the same survey biases
as the general population.
</P>
<P>
   Then why is it that the market does better than the polls _
which currently show Gov. George W. Bush well ahead of Gore _ in
forecasting the election outcome?
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa researchers offer a convincing explanation of this
seeming paradox using the notion of ``marginal traders.'' A
marginal trader, in their context, is an especially sophisticated
participant in the market, as measured by the kind of trading
strategies he or she uses.
</P>
<P>
   Such traders tended to have twice as much an investment as the
other traders and realized a much larger rate of return on their
money invested in the market. They also participated in the market
much more frequently. In other words, the marginal traders were the
professionals, speculators who traded frequently, methodically and
profitably.
</P>
<P>
   The most remarkable characteristic of the marginal traders was
that their survey responses showed no evidence of the judgment
biases exhibited by ordinary participants. Some traders liked
Republican candidates, some liked the Democratic candidates. But if
their candidate's price became too high, they would sell him in a
minute.
</P>
<P>
   The market forecasts are better than the polls not only because
the participants have to put their money where their mouth is, but
the market itself gives extra weight to the more calculating
participants.
</P>
<P>
   The market is a good predictor of election outcomes not because
all the participants are rational, but because the smart money is
what moves the market.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The jet stream will dip south from Canada on Thursday, heralding
a return to cooler conditions across the Northeast. Showers will
develop Thursday along the leading edge of cooler air from New
England to the Middle Atlantic states. Furthermore, scattered
thunderstorms will erupt from the Chesapeake Bay to the eastern
Carolinas as the push of cooler air intercepts very humid air.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms will form over much of the
Southeast. A few of the storms will produce very heavy rain, which
will lead to local flooding. Farther west, thunderstorms will also
appear in northern Texas and New Mexico as humid air interacts with
a front.
</P>
<P>
   Onshore breezes will end the unseasonable heat near the
Northwest coast, but the interior will remain hot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: LIGHTNING
</P>
<P>
   Lightning injured a 19-year-old man at the Greater Hartford Open
on Tuesday. During an average year, lightning is responsible for
more than 100 deaths nationwide. As the negatively charged base of
a thunderstorm passes overhead, large amounts of positive charge
accumulate on protruding objects. As a result, most deaths from
lightning occur near tall or isolated objects. People caught in an
open area during a lightning storm should crouch as low as possible
but should not lie down. A nearby strike can travel along the
ground, so minimal contact with the surface is recommended.

IN RUSSIA, A YOUNG MAN'S THOUGHTS TURN TO HACKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By JOHN VAROLI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a teen-ager living in St. Petersburg, Russia, Slava was an
accomplished athlete, with a fanatical love of high-risk sports
like snowboarding and skiing. In March 1998, a snowboarding
accident left him paralyzed from the waist down. Now 22, Slava
spends his evenings at home with his parents and 16-year-old
brother and engages in a different sport: hacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take us about five minutes to start hacking into other
computers,'' Slava said after making his way across his bedroom
with the aid of two crutches.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a seat in front of his Pentium 166 PC, he opened a
hacking program that he had downloaded from the Internet and typed
in a range of numbers specifying Internet Protocol addresses he had
found by hacking into a major American Internet service provider.
His computer began to hum and search for computers that were online
and in that IP range.
</P>
<P>
   Slava, who is known to his fellow hackers as Dr. Linux, waited
for about a minute for his computer to list nearly a dozen
computers and their IP addresses. He clicked energetically with his
mouse and hitting different function keys to zero in on one
computer. Slava pulled up the computer's contents on his screen.
The documents were written in German for a college course and
included a file that contained a paper analyzing far-right
political groups in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken his files, and he'll never know it,'' Slava said
as he opened and copied some of the files. ``Most people have no
idea that once online, they are wide open to intrusion from others
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   He tried to gain access to another computer on his list, but
that one was protected behind a firewall. ``I could probably crack
it,'' he said, ``but it would take me several hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Slava is one of a growing number of computer hackers in Russia.
Most of them are afraid to speak to reporters because they know
their activities are illegal. Slava agreed to be interviewed but
not to have his full name disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with primitive personal computers and _ given the lack of
well-paying jobs in Russia _ a lot of free time, Russians are
earning an international reputation for hacking skills. In 1999,
Russian hackers took credit for a number of high-profile attacks
that disrupted Web sites operated by NATO and the U.S. government.
Last year, CNN reported ``coordinated, organized attacks'' on
Pentagon computers by Russian hackers.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a Russian hacker took credit for the theft of
300,000 credit card numbers from CD Universe, an online music
store. In April, five hackers were arrested in Moscow for stealing
credit card numbers. Last year, hackers broke into the computers of
Gazprom, the biggest company in Russia and the largest natural gas
company in the world _ the Russian police did not specify when and
how. The hackers briefly gained control of the system that
regulates the flow of natural gas in pipelines, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent increase in Russian hacking is a lot like the
increase of viruses that accompanied the entrance of Russian
programmers onto the world stage in the early 1990s and who also
had few legitimate outlets for their knowledge,'' said Pavel
Semyanov, a computer security expert at St. Petersburg Polytech
University and a co-author of the book ``Internet Attack,'' which
is available only in Russian.
</P>
<P>
   But most hacking in Russia has been limited to vandalizing Web
sites and mild forms of online hooliganism, and some Russian
computer experts complain that the threat of Russian hackers has
been exaggerated in the American press.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Cold War mentality, and Americans are now obsessed
with Russian hackers,'' said Daniil Dougaev, chief editor of
Internet.ru, a popular Russian Web publication. ``If it is learned
the hackers behind the Pentagon job are, say, from Iceland, it
probably won't grab headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Semyanov said the threat of Russian hackers was exaggerated by
Western news media. He disputed whether the Pentagon attack had
even taken place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible,'' Semyanov said, ``to break into secret
computer systems, such as the Pentagon's, because these are
separate computer networks with no connection to the outside
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Russians have long had a reputation for computer prowess.
State-run technical schools, primarily those in St. Petersburg,
produce highly regarded programmers, and many Russian programmers
find work with American high-tech companies. But the hackers
themselves say that Russia's hackers usually have no formal
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hardly knew anything about computers up until two years
ago,'' Slava said, ``and only began hacking one year ago. The best
hackers are those who are simply more curious, more clever, more
willing to understand how a system really works. It's rare, at
least in Russia, that those with a formal computer education,
especially in programming, are hackers.''
</P>
<P>
   For young people in Russia, a country where Internet use is
growing rapidly but where there is still a frustrating lack of
jobs, hacking has become a subculture with a strong allure. Local
online charges run between 60 cents and $1.20 an hour, a
prohibitive amount in a country where salaries average about $50 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, many of these young hackers are interested in nothing
more than stealing passwords to get free Internet access, said
Boris Striglov, a police investigator in St. Petersburg. Striglov
worked on the case of Vladimir Levin, a hacker who stole $10
million from Citibank over four months in the summer of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of hackers,'' said Dmitri Leonov, who wrote
``Internet Attack'' with Semyanov and founded Hackzone.ru, a Web
site popular with Russian hackers, ``are teen-agers who get their
hands on some hacking software. As the Web becomes more and more
common in Russia, we can expect more problems with Russian hackers,
not necessarily because they are malicious but because they have a
mischievous and childlike desire to understand thoroughly how these
systems work.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his snowboarding accident, Slava said, he never imagined
that he would join the growing ranks of Russia's hackers. Unable to
work and forced to rely on his parents, who have sales jobs and do
not earn much more than the average wage, Slava borrowed money from
his family and friends for a Pentium 166 PC and an Internet hookup.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My computer and the Internet have become my world,'' he said,
looking around his room at the posters of skiers and windsurfers
that plaster the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Slava's first attempt at hacking was just over a year ago, when
he downloaded some software from a hacker Web site. ``If I could
earn decent money as a computer specialist,'' he said, ``I would
not be doing this, and would not mind paying for access, but, in
Russia, there are too many bright minds and not enough work to go
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackers have also turned to politics. Russia's war in Chechnya,
for instance, was fought not only on the ground and in the air, but
also in cyberspace. In January, the site of a leading Russian news
wire was hacked into, and the site's usual fare was replaced by a
Chechen propaganda announcement that said the Russian
president-elect, Vladimir Putin, had been sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian computer experts say that Russian agencies like the
Federal Security Service, or FSB, the successor to the KGB, often
employ the services of hackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are organized groups of hackers tied to the FSB, and
pro-Chechen sites have been hacked by such groups,'' said Vladimir
Veinstein, a 25-year-old computer security specialist in St.
Petersburg who works for the Internet company Red Net. ``One man I
know, who was caught committing a cybercrime, was given the choice
of either prison or cooperation with the FSB, and he went along.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, a pro-Chechen Web site, Kavkaz.org, was shut down by
hackers working for the FSB, Veinstein said. In March, the computer
system of an opposition newspaper in Moscow, Novaya Gazeta, was
hacked and a major part of one of its issues was deleted just as
the newspaper was to publish an article about Putin's campaign
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Slava said that no one had offered _ or threatened _ him with
the opportunity to perform that kind of computer work, but he would
consider it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, hacking is mostly sport,'' he said. ``But if someone
offered me big money to hack someone else's system, I'd give it
serious consideration.''

&HT;     GORE ATTACKS BUSH ON CHOICES FOR SUPREME COURT  
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKLICK, Ohio _ Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday lambasted
Supreme Court justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas for their
opinions against abortion rights and claimed that George W. Bush
would use them as the ``model'' to fill any high court vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   The two justices were among dissenters in the 5-to-4 high court
decision striking down Nebraska's ban on a late-term surgical
abortion procedure dubbed ``partial-birth abortion'' by opponents.
Scalia and Thomas also dissented on a 6-to-3-decision in a Colorado
case where the majority gave states wide leeway to limit
anti-abortion demonstrations near clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, touring the Midwest to pitch his energy policies, said the
dissent by Scalia and Thomas in the Nebraska case was ``very bitter
in tone and divisive in nature.'' Gore said Scalia's dissent in the
Colorado case was ``a particularly convoluted bit of logic.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving to make the direction of the Supreme Court a top issue in
the presidential campaign, Gore said the nation's next president
may be called upon to nominate three or four justices to replace
members of the present court who may retire.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the high court's ``razor thin'' decisions on
hot-button social issues such as abortion rights could be reversed
if Bush won the presidency and could nominate new justices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Gov. Bush has said his models for future nominations
would be Justices Scalia and Thomas, it is obvious that he intends
_ if he ever gets the chance _ to try to change the court's opinion
on a woman's right to choose,'' Gore warned. ``The presidential
election will decide the future of the Supreme Court and that in
turn will decide whether or not we keep a woman's right to choose _
or see it taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush last November told interviewers that he would use the two
justices as models for any nominations for the court that he would
make as president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, also campaigning Wednesday in the swing state of Ohio with
appearances in Cleveland, said through spokeswoman Karen Hughes
that he was ``disappointed'' that the high court had overturned
Nebraska's ban on late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``States should have the right to enact reasonable laws and
restrictions, particularly concerning the brutal practice of
partial-birth abortion,'' Hughes said, adding: ``Unlike Al Gore, I
pledge to fight for a ban on partial-birth abortion.``
</P>
<P>
   Bush has taken two different positions, both of them in the
anti-abortion mode. He has voiced support for a GOP platform that
calls for a constitutional amendment to ban all abortions and he
has specifically endorsed a constitutional amendment to outlaw
abortion except in cases of rape, incest and to protect the life of
the mother.
</P>
<P>
   But the two-term Texas governor has rejected religious
conservatives' demands that he weed out prospective judicial
nominees by imposing a so-called ``litmus test'' on abortion,
vowing only that he will appoint judges ``who strictly interpret
the Constitution and who will not use the bench to legislate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who also rules out a ``litmus test'' for choosing judges,
told an audience here that he would appoint judges such as the late
Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan who view the Constitution as
a changing document and ``are not locked in the narrow meaning of
words as they were used 200 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Court scholars speculate that the next president may be handed
the opportunity to shape the high court in a way that hasn't been
matched since Republican Richard Nixon appointed four justices at
the outset of the 1970s and Republican Herbert Hoover named three
in the early 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   The four leading retirement candidates on the present court
during the term of the next president are: John Paul Stevens, 80,
appointed by Gerald Ford; Chief Justice William Rehnquist, 75,
nominated by Richard Nixon and elevated by Ronald Reagan; Sandra
Day O'Connor, 70, named by Reagan, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 67,
appointed by appointed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The latest national survey, released Monday by CNN/USA Today,
showed Bush leading Gore 52 percent to 39 percent in a two-way
race. The survey had a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, Americans remain strongly supportive of a woman's
right to choose. An NBC/ Wall Street Journal survey completed June
18, found 57 percent favored a woman's right to choose, 32 percent
favored legalized abortion only in cases where the pregnancy
stemmed from rape, incest or imperiled the life of the mother. Nine
percent favored a total ban on abortion. The survey had a margin of
error of 2 percent.

</P>
<P>
   Gore injected his reaction to Supreme Court rulings while
visiting this rural community east of Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In a region where gasoline prices have soared, Gore proposed
providing consumers tax credits of up to $6,000 to buy energy
efficient hybrid electric- and-gas-powered cars and up to $2,000
for energy-efficient new homes, in addition to other steps to boost
the nation's energy efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Chapman, whose six-member family recently bought a new
energy efficient home in a neighborhood of $140,000 homes, said he
had cut family energy costs by 40 percent by upgrading to the kinds
of energy-efficient equipment that would qualify for the tax credit
outlined by Gore, if approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this stuff really does work?'' asked Gore, wearing an olive
sport shirt and slacks and seated on a stack of plywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it does,'' said Chapman, a father of four boys seated
adjacent to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wirth, 43, a father of three who used to sell homes in the
area, said local residents are not blaming Gore for skyrocketing
gasoline prices that have driven up the cost of refilling his
Cadillac to $32.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Clinton and Gore ought to be doing more to cut
gasoline and energy prices,'' said Wirth, who said he was a
Democrat. ``But people around here understand that the problem goes
deeper than the White House. Life has been good for most of us. If
somebody's not working nowadays, there's something wrong with
them.''

`BORROWING' FAMILY RECIPES BURNS SOME COOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time honored among amateur cooks that if a friend is
excellently skilled in the creation of a peach cobbler, for
instance, to say between swallows, ``Oh, I love that; can I have
the recipe?'' At such moments of conviviality, it is proudly given
and gratefully received.
</P>
<P>
   But things are very different in the fraternity of professional
chefs and cookbook authors, where jealousies and passions are as
plentiful as stuffed artichokes, and charges of plagiarism of
recipes at times seem almost pandemic. Of course, the better
practitioners of the art of borrowing are generally smart enough at
least to alter the amounts of the ingredients: i.e., make it 6
ounces of shredded caciocavallo cheese rather than 3{ and change
the wording of the instructions. Still, an astute food person knows
who created which recipe, absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   This season's accusation of recipe plundering was made by Mimi
Sheraton, a prolific author of food books, against David Ruggerio,
once chef at La Caravelle and Le Chantilly, past celebrity
television cook and currently author of ``David Ruggerio's Italian
Kitchen: Family Recipes From the Old Country'' (Artisan).
</P>
<P>
   Ruggerio's recipe for roasted shoulder of veal with herbs set
off Sheraton's memory buds, she said, having remembered making the
same dish herself ``exactly as he described it'' from ``Marcella's
Italian Kitchen'' (Knopf, 1986) by Marcella Hazan.
</P>
<P>
   So after some research Sheraton, who used to be a restaurant
critic of The New York Times, accused Ruggerio of using 10 recipes
from four cookbooks ``that appear in almost identical form in
Ruggerio's new book.'' They ranged from luganega sausage with
black-eyed peas and tomatoes to charcoal grilled deviled chicken,
although she said that Ruggerio added garlic to the chicken dish,
``perhaps indicating a burst of creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Her allegations appeared in an article on the Web site of
Brill's Content (www.brillscontent.com), to be updated and
reprinted in the magazine in September. Ruggerio, who declined to
speak to me for this column, told Sheraton that the 150 recipes in
his book came from himself, his family and friends. She said he
explained the 10 recipe look-alikes to her this way: ``They are
very simple standards with just a few ingredients, and they are
always made the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Great chefs and cookbook authors have a protocol, an honor
system, about using recipes not their own. The author either
directly attributes the recipe to another chef or in an equally
acceptable but more informal way introduces it something like this:
I had dinner recently at X's house (or restaurant) and asked her
for the fine version of the stuffed meat roll she served.
</P>
<P>
   The line between originality and pastiche is fine indeed in
cookbooks, and what constitutes plagiarism is harder to define than
in a poetry book. Judith Jones, a legendary Knopf editor who has
edited many cookbooks, said: ``You cannot actually plagiarize
ingredients. Old-fashioned baking-powder biscuits: how many ways
can you change it? If you try too hard you'll ruin it. It's usually
in the explaining, the writing of the instructions.'' It's also in
the philosophical approach.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``It's hard to plagiarize classic dishes, but its
another thing for the unusual recipes, the greatest dish of tripe.
You look at that recipe side by side with another: the same
ingredients, the same technique. It's not fair play, but it happens
a lot, and every 10 years or so there's a scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruggerio's recipe for ``Baked Shrimp, Potatoes and Tomatoes''
was almost identical to the recipe created by Giuliano Bugialli for
his book, ``Foods of Sicily and Sardinia and the Smaller Islands''
(Rizzoli, 1996), according to both Sheraton and Bugialli.
</P>
<P>
   ``To add insult to injury, he took another of my recipes from a
different book, a Sicilian recipe, and made it a Tuscan recipe
without changing it,'' Bugialli said. Which gives you a flavor of
the seriousness and territorial imperatives in the writing of the
books. Still, Bugialli said, even this indignity was topped when he
went into a bookstore recently and found his latest book, ``On
Pasta'' (Stewart, Tabori &AMP; Chang), on the shelf right next to
Ruggerio's.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher of Ruggerio's book, Ann Bramson, said on Tuesday:
``I can say I am very uncomfortable with the similarity. I've been
obsessing about it and discussing it.'' She said that she didn't
intend to pull it from distribution. ``But I'm looking into
reprinting,'' she said. ``Coming from a personal and moral point of
view, if I had known, I would have not gone to press with these
recipes in the book.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, 25,000 copies are in print.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most notable recent cookbook scandal occurred in
1984, when Richard Nelson was accused of stealing recipes from
Richard Olney's ``Simple French Food'' (Atheneum, 1974) for his
book ``Richard Nelson's American Cooking'' (New American Library).
Nelson had been president of the International Association of
Culinary Professionals. He and his publisher settled out of court,
but it was as if a bank president had been charged with bouncing
checks.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Malloy, senior editor at Warner Books, is trying to take
the company into cookbooks in a substantial way next year. Is he
worried about plagiarism? Not really. He said: ``There are only so
many ways to roast a piece of veal shoulder. If you picked up 10
cookbooks, you would find a lot of the procedure and the
ingredients are the same. Like any writer, the cookbook writer
should develop a personal style. So the plagiarism usually comes
down to the language.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right way to use another person's recipe is to say `I've
been influenced by my colleague Julia Child,' or `I had this
marvelous meal at a farmhouse in Tuscany.' People who cook and eat
and taste for a living are like a business writer or a golf writer
_ they know what's going on and will catch you.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Child said that stealing recipes ``is so stupid a thing
to do that I can only wonder if someone else didn't put the book
together for him, and he didn't read over.'' She continued:
``That's happened before. It's so stupid I can't think of any other
explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   She has just finished her 11th cookbook. ``I wouldn't pay too
much attention if someone stole a recipe of mine. I guess it would
be a compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   Only an author of who is to cookbooks what Katharine Hepburn is
to the movies would be that confident. She knows everybody would
know a Julia Child recipe.

FED DECIDES TO LEAVE INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED, AT LEAST FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve on Wednesday voted to leave
interest rates unchanged, giving itself more time to determine
whether the series of rate hikes it has imposed over the last year
are slowing the economy sufficiently to avoid an upturn in
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But the central bank warned that it could start raising rates
again as soon as its next meeting, on Aug. 22, unless economic
indicators in coming weeks provide assurance that the red-hot pace
of economic growth earlier this year has given way to a more
sustainable level that reduces the threat of an inflationary spiral
in wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's decision had been widely anticipated by economists and
investors, and Wall Street took the news in stride.
</P>
<P>
   In calling a time out Wednesday in its campaign of rate
increases _ six over the last year, pushing its benchmark federal
funds target rate up by 1.75 percentage points to 6.5 percent _ the
Fed acknowledged said there was some evidence that the economy is
cooling off. And the central bank noted that while inflation by
some measures has been accelerating, price pressures are being held
down by continuing improvements in productivity, a measure of the
economy's ability to produce more for less.
</P>
<P>
   But the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market
Committee suggested that it remains unconvinced that the economic
slowdown is for real. It stressed its continuing concern that the
current low rate of unemployment could lead wages to rise so fast
that companies would be forced to jack up their prices.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of moderating growth ``are still tentative and
preliminary, and the utilization of the pool of available workers
remains at an unusually high level,'' the committee said in a
statement released at the conclusion of a two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Under those circumstances, the statement said, ``the committee
believes the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions
that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable
future.''

&HT;     CUBAN JEWS SURVIVE YEARS IN THE REVOLUTIONARY DESERT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, July 2)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA, Cuba _ According to the Bible, it took Moses 40 years to
lead the ancient Hebrews out of the desert and into the promised
land _ about the same amount of time it has taken Cuba's small
Jewish community to get back on its feet under Communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   Depleted by departures since Fidel Castro seized power in 1959,
Cuba's tiny Jewish population of 1,500 is rebuilding itself.
</P>
<P>
   The worship sanctuary at Havana's main Jewish community center
and synagogue, known as the Patronato, has been renovated, largely
with American donations. It is now a warm and inviting place,
hardly distinguishable from similar spaces in suburban U.S.
synagogues.
</P>
<P>
   For decades it had been a wreck. Tiles were falling from the
ceiling, and birds, flying freely in and out of broken windows,
occasionally left their mark on congregants below.
</P>
<P>
   The newly repaired sanctuary is a fitting symbol of how far
Cuba's Jewish population has traveled in 41 years under Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are OK here,'' said Dr. Jose Miller, 74, a retired surgeon
who serves as the community's leader in the absence of a full-time
rabbi. ``There is no anti-Semitism. We used to be isolated, but
things have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   With a membership of 150 families, the Patronato is the largest
of Cuba's five synagogues. It sponsors a religious school for
children, a library, activities for senior citizens and training
for young adults to lead worship services.
</P>
<P>
   It also serves food after worship services and doubles as a
mini-pharmacy _ important features in a nation where food is
rationed and medicine is scarce.
</P>
<P>
   A picture on the wall shows Castro in his signature green
fatigues posing with Miller at a 1998 party celebrating Hanukkah,
the 8-day Jewish festival of lights.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship was not always so cozy. As a Communist state,
Cuba officially opposed all forms of organized religion. Churches
and synagogues were not allowed to operate religious schools of any
kind. Declaring yourself a ``believer'' was a sure way not to get
the best jobs or admitted to the best schools.
</P>
<P>
   All that changed in 1991 with the downfall of the Soviet Union.
Job applications and government forms no longer asked questions
about religious affiliation. Also, the hard times and grinding
shortages drove many people to seek answers in religion _ some if
only to get a little extra food.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1959 revolution, Cuba had a robust Jewish population
of 15,000. Jews from Turkey and other parts of the Middle East had
settled there after World War I. And European Jews fleeing Adolf
Hitler before and during World War II found refuge in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But when Castro declared the island a Communist state and seized
private businesses, the vast majority of Jews began departing for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Adela Dworin, vice president at the Patronato and chief
librarian, was studying to be a lawyer in 1961 when Castro seized
her father's clothing factory. ``He wanted to leave and I wanted to
stay,'' she recalled in an interview. ``He said, `If you're not
leaving, then I'm staying too.'''
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1960s, Dworin bid goodbye to virtually all her
classmates and Jewish friends. She began working in the Patronato
library. ``Those were difficult years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, a small number of Jewish families continued to
celebrate the Sabbath and Jewish holidays. ``Someone had to stay
here and maintain the traditions of our community,'' Dworin said.
``I think I made the right choice.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jewish Cubans, the rebirth of interest in religion over the
past decade has yielded a mixture of hope, challenge and
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian shipments of matzoh, ritual wine and other Passover
holiday foods revitalized interest in Jewish holidays.
</P>
<P>
   But the complexity of Kosher laws governing food preparation,
combined with the harsh realities Cuba's erratic food supply, mean
that while the synagogue does not serve forbidden foods such as
pork and shellfish, its meals are ``not 100 percent Kosher,''
Dworin said.
</P>
<P>
   The new faces showing up at the synagogue were not those of Jews
returning to their roots but those of Jews discovering them for the
first time. Virtually all had married non-Jews and knew little of
Jewish ritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked them questions, they didn't know,'' Dworin said.
``What's Shavuot? They didn't know.'' (It is a Jewish holiday
commemorating the revelation of Jewish law at Mount Sinai.)
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the synagogue was a place to get help and advice
and meet friends and _ for the young _ a place to find a boyfriend
or girlfriend. ``They feel like this is their second home,'' Dworin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Instruction came from veterans such as Dworin, as well as Jewish
volunteers from the United States and elsewhere. In 1995 a rabbi
started commuting a few times a year from Mexico, performing
conversions of 300 non-Jewish family members.
</P>
<P>
   Some young adults became proficient in reciting blessings and
portions of Hebrew scripture. They were designated to lead the
congregation in worship.
</P>
<P>
   But many who received the training decided to leave Cuba for
Israel. About 400 Cuban Jews have departed for Israel since 1994, a
potentially devastating blow to a small community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an up-and-down situation, but when someone moves
out, there's always someone there to move in,'' said June Safran of
Oakland, Calif., executive director of the Cuba-America Jewish
Mission, a people-to-people group. Safran has led delegations of
Jews mainly from California on trips to establish relations with
Cuban Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the community is going to survive, and it will
always be stronger than the period between the '60s and the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dworin, the dedication of the Patronato's remodeled
sanctuary last month went a long way toward muting the years of
turmoil. ``It was a dream come true,'' she said.

   Five years ago, search engines seemed like the Web's salvation.
Today, they need some saviors of their own.
</P>
<P>
   When search engines first appeared, they were hailed for
accomplishing two things that could not be done by people on any
large scale: Search engines use software agents to find and index
sites almost as soon as they appeared. And they could almost
instantaneously match a far-flung Web page with a single keyword
typed into a beckoning search box.
</P>

   But the promise of automation has been tempered by the Web's
success. There are now more than 1 billion Web pages, and according
to some experts' calculations, that number has been doubling once
every eight months. Keeping up with that growth has been nearly
impossible. Last summer a report from the NEC Research Institute,
the Princeton, N.J.-based research division of Japan's NEC Corp.
computer company, criticized search engines for missing thousands
of new Web sites and delivering search results littered with
outdated links. And at that point, the Web was only half its
current size.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the vastness of the Web that is causing problems.
Consider the way people search: Typical users enter single
keywords, cross their fingers and hit the search button. And when
they are faced with lists of 1,000 results, they usually click on
the first few options instead of refining their searches by adding
keywords or trying new terms.
</P>
<P>
   The confluence of technological limitations and simple searching
methods means that only two kinds of online searchers are served
well: those looking for popular terms and those who are using
uncommon words to hunt for specific things. But the majority of
searchers, whose requests fall somewhere between, are finding
searching as frustrating as ever.
</P>
<P>
   To cope, many search engine developers have concluded that
simply indexing more pages is not the answer. Instead, they have
decided to rely on human judgment. Search engines have become more
like cyborgs, part human, part machine.
</P>
<P>
   For information scientists who have spent decades refining
computer-based search techniques, that is bad news. Introducing the
human touch into search engines also means introducing human
biases. What the scientists want is a form of artificial
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   But just as robots are not yet cleaning houses, search engines
still have far to go before they start reading people's minds.
Current computer code is not sophisticated enough to do the job
alone, most search-engine founders say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly everyone is doing a little of both these days,'' said
Bill Bliss, general manager of MSN Search.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular Web-based search services employ people to do
at least some of that mind reading. Rankings from
Nielsen/NetRatings, an Internet research firm, show that Yahoo, a
directory created by its employees, is the most popular search
service, with nearly 40 million visitors in May.
</P>
<P>
   The latest figures from the Internet measurement company Media
Metrix also put Yahoo first, with about 63 million visitors.
</P>
<P>
   About.com, an online service that does not even attempt to use
automated crawlers to seek out new Web sites, has made its way into
Media Metrix's top 10 in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Another highly ranked search service is AskJeeves, which prods
people to narrow their queries by picking from a list of questions
and answers written by the company's employees.
</P>
<P>
   Two other search engines that have been gaining a following are
Google and Northern Light. A year ago, neither was listed in
NetRatings' top 25 rankings. Now they are listed among more
established search engines like Alta Vista, Excite and Lycos, which
have been tweaking their own systems to include more people power.
</P>
<P>
   Both Google and Northern Light rely on computers and software to
scan and index the Web, but human judgment is part of the mix. At
Google, Web pages that are linked from authoritative Web sites are
deemed most relevant. At Northern Light, librarians constantly
fine-tune their directory structure and come up with names of
categories used for sorting Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Some of what scientists consider the possible pitfalls of human
interference were on display at a recent meeting at Northern
Light's headquarters in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Eight information specialists sipped coffee around an oblong
table, wrestling with the definition of a single two-word phrase:
alternative lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a gossip session about the background of a Northern
Light employee, nor was it a digression about the pro-marijuana
protesters who were picketing on Boston Common a few days before.
Northern Light uses categories displayed online in folders,
categories with titles that are decided upon by people and that are
continually being revised.
</P>
<P>
   One of those categories was ``alternative lifestyles,'' which,
on its face, looked relatively harmless. But the people sitting
around the table knew that the category had problems. The category
included sites on subjects as divergent as anarchism, college
fraternities and baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   As Joyce Ward, the company's vice president for editorial
services and the leader of the meeting, pointed out, ``We've got
sites on country clubs in that category.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone laughed at that, but there was little question that
``alternative lifestyles'' was not inclusive enough. If people saw
a folder with that title, would they know that links to such a
broad array of sites might lie inside?
</P>
<P>
   Another title was proposed _ ``cultures and lifestyles'' _ and
the conversation moved on to the next debate: Was ``extremist
groups'' a fair label for a category? Or would ``fringe groups'' be
less loaded?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``extremist groups'' won. Now when people conduct a
search that retrieves documents about terrorism, for example, they
will be likely to see a folder that is labeled ``extremist groups''
appearing on the left side of their screens.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The refinements are Northern Light's way of bringing a touch of
human judgment into a machine-driven process. The company uses
computers with text-reading programs to analyze the content of Web
pages, figure out their meanings and put them in appropriate
categories. Meanwhile, people make editorial decisions about what
those categories should be.
</P>
<P>
   But Everett Brenner, an expert in information retrieval systems,
is not convinced that such a system is the best answer.
</P>
<P>
   Even with automation, he said, classification systems are
unreliable for serious searchers _ precisely because they rely on
human judgments on labeling information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that those systems break down,'' he said. ``Your
best paper in psychology might be based in a category called
religion.'' The further you categorize something, he continued,
``the more information you lose.''
</P>
<P>
   David Evans, chief executive of Claritech, an
information-management company, dislikes categories for another
reason: ``When people do classification,'' he said, ``they are
typically biased by what they know and understand.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, many scientists thought they were close to
solving such information retrieval problems. Sophisticated
computational techniques, including programs that looked at the
structure and semantics of sentences, had been applied to closed
databases, like CD-ROMs with abstracts of science articles. And
they seemed to work.
</P>
<P>
   But they were blessed with one quality that did not seem so
crucial at the time: Information within the databases was
controlled and uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years later, the Web popularity arrived. Suddenly
information management became a messy proposition. If a database
can be compared to a cookbook, the Web includes a never-ending
shelf of cookbooks, half of which are missing pages, personal
commentary by the cooks, snapshots of the meals in progress and
homemade movies of the kitchen sink.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is a completely different environment,'' said Danny
Sullivan, editor of SearchEngineWatch.com, ``and so the technology
has to change in response to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Northern Light's system, two other techniques are
being employed to handle the complexity.
</P>
<P>
   One is the approach taken by DirectHit, a search engine that
analyzes what people have clicked on during previous searches and
gives searchers the most popular results. Search engines like those
used for AOL's ICQ software, Lycos and HotBot integrate DirectHit's
technology into their own.
</P>
<P>
   Google offers a similar approach. Using a patent-pending process
of link analysis, Google's technology gives a numerical rank to Web
pages based on the number of times those pages are linked from an
authoritative Web site _ an authority is a Web site that ranks
especially high in Google's rankings.
</P>
<P>
   But some information scientists do not like these techniques
either.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, they say, is the ``tyranny of the majority.''
</P>
<P>
   What if searchers are not interested in finding the most popular
document? What if they are trying to find obscure information that
is not likely to have been linked from other Web sites?
</P>
<P>
   Rich Greenfield, an information specialist at the Library of
Congress, put it this way: Search engines that rely on analysis of
links and clicks may be making a fatal mistake, especially if
people are linking and clicking to Web sites that are not useful
after all. They are assuming, he said, ``that the people who know
what they are doing outnumber the people who don't.''
</P>
<P>
   So scientists continue to strive for the day when a computer
will analyze a Web document and, without any human interference,
instantly understand what that document is about. Some have been
trying to build systems that try to understand the searcher as
well, by either analyzing the context in which a query is posed or
by offering a few simple prompts, help that person to refine the
results.
</P>
<P>
   One company, LexiQuest, has created Web-based software that
analyzes texts and queries to extract their meaning. Developed by
experts in computational linguistics and designed to be integrated
into search engines, the program examines the definitions of words
and the structure of sentences. It also reads requests that people
have asked in natural language.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent demonstration, the query ``I want to book a room''
was understood as a search for lodging, while the query ``I want to
buy a book'' returned results for online bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the advent of such programs, Greg Notess, the
editor of an online newsletter called Search Engine Showdown, still
expects to see cyborg versions of search engines for some time to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Notess, a reference librarian at Montana State University, has
seen people helping people too many times to imagine that computers
can do it better. ``I don't expect, in our lifetimes,'' he said,
``to see machines do it all.''

US ATTEMPT TO ARRANGE MIDEAST SUMMIT FAILS 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration's shot at brokering a
Palestinian-Israeli peace deal just became even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright failed Wednesday in
Jerusalem to persuade Palestinian negotiators to attend a summit
akin to the Camp David proceeedings a generation ago because of the
vast gulf between the Israeli and Palestinian positions.
</P>
<P>
   The US administration has long privately calculated that it has
until mid-September to bring about an Israeli-Palestinian deal
because of the time needed to shepherd through Congress a
multibillion-dollar aid package for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday, the already dim prospects looked far bleaker.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating President Clinton's appetite to go down in history
as a peacemaker in the Holy Land, all sides publicly said it was
now up to Clinton to decide when to hold a summit in the Washington
area. Clinton himself said so at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make a judgment about whether the time is right to ask
them to come here,'' he said. ``But I have not made that decision
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned that the difficult issues will not become any
easier in months or years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that some foreign policy problems, the answer is to
kick the can down the road and . . . hope time takes care of
them,'' he said. ``My own instinct is that the cluster of problems
here would be better off being resolved sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinian leaders indicated, as they have for weeks, that
the decision on a summit was ultimately up to them. They indicated
a summitcould be counterproductive because the two sides have not
come closer on the knotty issues of borders, settlers, Palestinian
refugees, water rights and the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really can't bridge oceans,'' Nabil Shaath, a key Arafat
adviser, told reporters in Jerusalem. ``It's much easier to bridge
rivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who has had serious
difficulties in holding together his fragile coalition in the
Knesset, had pinned much hope on a White House-convened summit,
which Israeli officials were saying quietly could be held as early
as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Barak declared that Israel ``will not return to the borders of
1967,'' when it seized the West Bank and Gaza Strip and where about
170,000 Jewish settlers now live. Some Israeli officials have said
they were willing to give 92 percent of the territory, and accept
the declaration of Palestinian statehood with borders to be decided
at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli prime minister also said negotiations would not
advance substantially unless he and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat sat down, with Clinton prodding them along. ``The real
negotiations will open only if there's a summit,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year in office, Barak has successfully withdrawn
Israeli troops from Lebanon, but he has failed to make inroads on
his ambitious agenda to seal peace deals with Syria and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, he boldly predicted that he and Arafat would
agree by February to a framework on how to tackle the most serious
issues, and they would nail down the final deal by September. But
still no framework agreement has been reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's happened with Albright's visit is that with all
of the final status issues _ border, settlement, refugees,
Jerusalem _ they were too far apart to come to Washington,'' said
Richard W. Murphy, director of the Middle East Studies at the
Council on Foreign Relations and former US ambassador to Syria and
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Murphy said, the focus turns to Arafat and whether he will
unilaterally declare a Palestinian state this fall, as he has
promised to do. ``On one hand, that is heard in Israel with less
anxiety than in the past,'' he said. ``But there is a growing
concern that could trigger violence as well.''
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Crowley, spokesman for the National Security Council, said
the deadline for reaching a peace deal was not the end of Clinton's
term in seven months. ``This is not about our timetable. This is
about their timetable,'' Crowley said. ``And they have set a very
aggressive timetable to make an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton clearly will push both sides for a deal soon, and if
he fails, the peace process could slip into hibernation. Recent
history indicates that it takes at least two years for a new
president to become engaged fully in Middle Eastern issues. It
takes time for the new president and his aides to understand and
become engaged with the issues as well as develop trust with all
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Clinton becoming active in negotiations in coming
weeks, however, there is no guarantee of a positive outcome,
something that the world learned this year after a failed meeting
in Geneva between Clinton and Syrian President Hafez Assad, who
died this month.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some observers said an Israeli-Palestinian summit could
be regarded as a Clinton high-wire act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ordinarily, you would think a summit would be fixed in
advance, more or less,'' said Geoffrey Aronson, head of the
Foundation for Middle East Peace, a Washington think tank. ``But
the experience we've had with the Clinton administration is that
they leap into these things, without a script in hand.''

`PROZAC BACKLASH': EXPLORING A DARK SIDE OF DEPRESSION REMEDIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From a 1996 drug advertisement in The Journal of Clinical
Psychiatry:
</P>
<P>
   ``A great day for Dad. A great day for Mom. A terrific day for
the family. Make it happen. The Zoloft Saturday.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For any of the estimated one in 10 Americans who have been
exposed to Prozac or the other, similar prescription medicines
discussed in his blistering new book, Dr. Joseph Glenmullen offers
something none too welcome: reason to be anxious and depressed.
Even for anyone determined never to read anything with ``Prozac''
in its title, he presents an important, deeply troubling
examination of the means by which these drugs have become so widely
disseminated, and the possible long-term toll they may take.
</P>
<P>
   In a book that ensures he will never be the guest of honor at a
pharmaceutical convention, Glenmullen, a clinical instructor in
psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a practicing psychiatrist,
offers a wide-ranging and well-researched indictment. He begins by
invoking the track record of Thorazine, the tranquilizer that was
greeted as a psychological panacea in the 1950s, later produced
neurological side effects in 40 percent of patients and was not
burdened with an FDA warning label until 1985. What if Prozac and
other, similar drugs that have begun to be linked with the same
symptoms had a comparable effect?
</P>
<P>
   In a book as readable as it is alarming, Glenmullen crystallizes
the evidence that these drugs, selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (or SSRIs), by manipulating the influx of serotonin in
the brain, can create a ``backlash'' by affecting the levels of
other chemicals, notably dopamine. He shows how that process can
yield such Thorazine-associated fallout as facial tics, memory loss
and body-stiffening parkinsonism. ``The unfortunate irony is that
drugs heavily promoted as correcting unproven biochemical
imbalances may be, in fact, causing imbalances and brain damage,''
he asserts. ``Will silent damage caused by a serotonin booster
accelerate the aging process and make some people more prone to
develop neurological symptoms later in life?''
</P>
<P>
   It can and will be argued that such problems are rare and that
the much-vaunted uplifting effects of these drugs are more
significant than their potential detriments. Even so, ``Prozac
Backlash'' makes a tough, persuasive case that the drugs are more
dangerous than generally acknowledged, that patients and doctors
are insufficiently informed about the risks and that drug companies
devote vast amounts of money and energy to spin control.
</P>
<P>
   ``When discussing brain cell damage caused by street drugs such
as amphetamines, cocaine or Ecstasy, researchers speak in the
gravest terms, warning of dread effects,'' writes Glenmullen, who
presents abundant evidence of how so-called independent researchers
may prove to be on drug company payrolls. ``Only when referring to
prescription drugs do they suggest that pruning nerve cells might
be `therapeutic.'''
</P>
<P>
   The book spends much time on the important role of euphemism in
Prozac's public relations. For instance, Glenmullen offers a
lengthy discussion of the difficulty patients may experience in
trying to wean themselves from these drugs, even if Eli Lilly, the
company that manufactures Prozac, has run ads reading: ``Like other
antidepressants, it isn't habit-forming.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way he mentions a 1996 symposium that Eli Lilly
sponsored to discuss this problem, and notes that one upshot of the
meeting was a change in terminology, so that no one need use the
word withdrawal. ``The sanitized term `antidepressant
discontinuation syndrome' is the kind of well-funded obfuscation
doctors and patients frequently face when trying to get honest,
reliable information on these powerful drugs,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of euphemism, Glenmullen explains how Prozac can
claim that only 2 to 5 percent of users experience sexual
dysfunction, although other evidence places that number as high as
60 percent. The team that did the original research on the drug
simply never raised the issue. He also shows how SSRI-related
anxiety and jitters were minimized for this research by ignoring
the fact that many of the patients studied were also taking
sedatives to control those symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   An especially disturbing section of the book delves into a
lawsuit brought against Eli Lilly by survivors of a rampage by
Joseph Wesbecker, who was the company's worst nightmare: a Prozac
user who went on the rampage in 1989 with an AK-47. Fortunately for
Eli Lilly, the 1994 trial was concurrent with the O.J. Simpson
trial, the facts were carefully manipulated, a secret settlement
was made between plaintiffs and the drug company even as the trial
continued, and Prozac avoided a warning label about possibly
violent or suicidal behavior. All the particulars of this
remarkable legal travesty are laid out here.
</P>
<P>
   Like much else in ``Prozac Backlash,'' the facts of the
Wesbecker trial are mostly available elsewhere. But the book's data
come from a great array of diverse sources, and Glenmullen has done
a prodigious job of assembling and illuminating it here. He argues
cogently and persuasively for better research, truly independent
research data, consumer skepticism about such drug
company-generated phenomena as ``National Depression Awareness
Day'' and less readiness on the part of doctors, whose patients may
see them only seldom because of insurance constraints, to hand out
antidepressants as an easy fix-it without follow-up visits or
closer attention.
</P>
<P>
   As a psychiatrist, Glenmullen shows a sharp bias for the
benefits of therapy over psychopharmacology, and it is here that
``Prozac Backlash'' is weak. When he offers case studies from his
own practice, model patients seem to respond magically to the
doctor's Sherlock Holmesian acuity in pinpointing their problems.
(``Do express elevators symbolize the fast track, which you have
mixed feelings about?'' he asks a phobic executive, whose fear
forces him to walk up to and down from a 43rd-floor office.)
</P>
<P>
   But a lengthy section of the book discusses herbal substitutes
for antidepressants, the importance of diet and exercise, 12-step
groups, friends, family and community as important in overcoming
depression. These things can work, he says _ even if as much money
is spent in the United States on promoting wonder drugs to doctors
than on all medical schooling and residency training combined. &QL;

INFECTIOUS DISEASES CAUSE MORE DEATHS THAN NATURAL DISASTERS,
REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Although earthquakes and floods usually receive the
most prominent news coverage, infectious diseases are claiming far
more lives than natural disasters, according to a report released
Wednesday by the Red Cross. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The death toll from infectious diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis
and malaria is 160 times greater than the number of people killed
in last year's massive earthquakes in Turkey, cyclones in India and
floods in Venezuela, said the International Federation of Red Cross
and Red Crescent Societies, which assists countries suffering from
natural disasters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 150 million people have died from those three
diseases alone since 1945 compared with 23 million in wars during
the same period, according to the Federation's World Disasters
Report. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The report's findings have caused the federation to re-examine
its work, according to its author, Peter Walker, head of disaster
policy. ``Everywhere we do disaster relief, we found the disaster
was built on the shaky bedrock of poor public health,'' he said.
``While we will still respond to disasters, we've got to
reinvigorate the second string in our bow _ long-term assistance.''
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross said that such aid is needed to combat increasing
health risks that result from climate change, growing urbanization
and environmental damage. Yet governments are lagging behind on
preventive health care. ``There has been a real change in the last
ten years. In almost every country, there is a facade of a health
system, but away from the city centers, there is nothing,'' Walker
said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said this problem enables diseases that were once
under control to re-emerge _ like malaria in Azerbaijan and
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 13 million people died from such diseases, which the
report said could have been prevented by spending as little as $5
per person in health care. ``Governments are slipping on their
responsibilities for immunization and basic health care,'' said Dr.
Hakan Sandbladh, a Red Cross health officer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, public spending on health in poorer
countries averages only 1 percent of gross domestic product,

   The report's authors said that money spent on changing people's
behavior saves more lives than money for expensive facilities like
hospitals and high-tech equipment. Sandbladh warned that money
meant for national health systems was not cost-effective because
most of it goes to big hospitals and not to preventive health
programs.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To us, it has become almost a forgotten war, but not
so to Baghdad and to the regime of Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   For 18 months now, British and American jets have prowled the
skies over the northern and southern sections of Iraq every day and
routinely let fly bombs and missiles on to targets below.
</P>
<P>
   This steady punishment of Iraq _ calculated to amount roughly to
one attack every three days _ has been going on since December
1998. That is when Hussein decided to challenge the no-fly zones
imposed nearly 10 years ago by the West, by firing at the allied
planes that are dispatched to patrol them.
</P>
<P>
   Since December 1998, the air combat in the zones has become most
intense. According to the Iraqis, British and American planes have
penetrated their air space 21,600 times.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, people can hear their screeching, but cannot seem
them. The pilots fly always at a safe altitude of 20,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Only rarely are the tragic human consequences reported. A
correspondent for The Washington Post wrote recently of the fate of
Omran Harbi Jawair, 13. He was watching his family's sheep on May
17 when a missile landed within feet of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without warning, according to several youths standing nearby,
the device came crashing down in an open field,'' the reporter,
Edward Cody, wrote. ``Four shepherds were wounded. And Omran, the
others recalled, lay dead in the dirt, most of his head torn off,
the white of his robe stained red.''
</P>
<P>
   While the orders from London and Washington are to destroy those
weapons that threaten the planes, the toll in lost Iraqi lives
continues to climb.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is, meanwhile, stepping up its rhetoric, decrying the
attacks and demanding that they be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi estimates, which have been partially confirmed by an
independent United Nations survey, suggest that some 300 Iraqis
have been killed and another 800 injured in the 18 months of
intense bombings. Iraq says that at least two-thirds of those
killed have been civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant-General Yassin Jasem, the Iraqi military spokesman,
last week ridiculed as false the claims by the U.S. and Britain
that their planes attack only in response to threats against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``American officials are nowadays producing lies in order to
cover their failure and daily crimes in the so-called two no-fly
zones,'' he declared at a news briefing in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The zones themselves were created in the aftermath of the 1991
Gulf War to protect minority Shia Muslims in the south of Iraq and
a Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq from attack by Saddam's military
forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon says that nearly 280,000 sorties have been flown
over the areas by American and British planes in the almost
decade-long period of enforcing the no-fly order. &QL;

   CUBA-ELIAN _ MIAMI _ The U.S. Supreme Court has decided not to
extend the stay keeping 6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez from
leaving the United States, or hear the Miami relatives appeal.
Barring some desparate last-minute attempt in another federal
court, at 4 p.m. EDT, his father Juan Miguel Gonzalez may finally
return with his son and family to Cuba _ which they apparently plan
to do on a 5 p.m. EDT chartered flight out of Washington Dulles
International Airport. What will be the reaction in the
Cuban-American community, and in Havana? Developing.

   SYRIA-CLASSICCARS _ DAMASCUS, Syria _ Between the centuries old
mosques and the Roman ruins, Syrians like Abdel Malek Sheikho keep
history rolling down the street. Sheikho screeches the tires of his
bright red 1951 DeSoto Delux as he weaves through the crowded
streets. It's powered by a Chevy engine and has the occasional
Cadillac part inside. And, he's got a large poster of the late
Syrian President Hafez Assad in the windshield. At the garage zone
on the edge of the capital, workers hammer the chrome trim around
the fins of a 1959 Buick. They scramble for parts to fit the motley
fleet brought in for repairs. They polish up a Bel Air station
wagon, a 1963 Mercedes, old Skoda's and Fiats. A closed economy and
high taxes make it hard to get cars in Syria, so drivers and
mechanics keep the old ones running. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   CHINA _ HONG KONG _ The first person I met in Hong Kong was
named Mao. But Elley Mao is no Maoist. The message from the
government economist for the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region of China was the same one that came from nearly everyone

control comes Saturday. But the former British colony is still very
much open for business, Mao says, and delighted to embrace any
capitalist imperialists who might come calling. (Melvin, Atlanta

<P>
   NEW YORK _ To us, it has become almost a forgotten war, but not
so to Baghdad and to the regime of Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   For 18 months now, British and American jets have prowled the
skies over the northern and southern sections of Iraq every day and
routinely let fly bombs and missiles on to targets below.
</P>
<P>
   This steady punishment of Iraq _ calculated to amount roughly to
one attack every three days _ has been going on since December
1998. That is when Hussein decided to challenge the no-fly zones
imposed nearly 10 years ago by the West, by firing at the allied
planes that are dispatched to patrol them.
</P>
<P>
   Since December 1998, the air combat in the zones has become most
intense. According to the Iraqis, British and American planes have
penetrated their air space 21,600 times.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, people can hear their screeching, but cannot seem
them. The pilots fly always at a safe altitude of 20,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Only rarely are the tragic human consequences reported. A
correspondent for The Washington Post wrote recently of the fate of
Omran Harbi Jawair, 13. He was watching his family's sheep on May
17 when a missile landed within feet of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without warning, according to several youths standing nearby,
the device came crashing down in an open field,'' the reporter,
Edward Cody, wrote. ``Four shepherds were wounded. And Omran, the
others recalled, lay dead in the dirt, most of his head torn off,
the white of his robe stained red.''
</P>
<P>
   While the orders from London and Washington are to destroy those
weapons that threaten the planes, the toll in lost Iraqi lives
continues to climb.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is, meanwhile, stepping up its rhetoric, decrying the
attacks and demanding that they be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi estimates, which have been partially confirmed by an
independent United Nations survey, suggest that some 300 Iraqis
have been killed and another 800 injured in the 18 months of
intense bombings. Iraq says that at least two-thirds of those
killed have been civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant-General Yassin Jasem, the Iraqi military spokesman,
last week ridiculed as false the claims by the U.S. and Britain
that their planes attack only in response to threats against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``American officials are nowadays producing lies in order to
cover their failure and daily crimes in the so-called two no-fly
zones,'' he declared at a news briefing in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The zones themselves were created in the aftermath of the 1991
Gulf War to protect minority Shia Muslims in the south of Iraq and
a Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq from attack by Saddam's military
forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon says that nearly 280,000 sorties have been flown
over the areas by American and British planes in the almost
decade-long period of enforcing the no-fly order. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard Butler, the outspoken Australian who led the
United Nations efforts to strip Iraq of its weapons of mass
destruction after the Gulf War, says he fears that Iraq has used
the 18 months without U.N. monitors to rearm.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has been under sanctions since the 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
but in an interview with the Independent, Butler said that Iraq had
exploited divisions among the five U.N. Security Council permanent
members _ Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has even ensured that ``Saddam has a veto at the Council
table'' by insisting that Iraq must approve of the future
inspection procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absence from Iraq of such (disarmament) work should be a
source of grave concern,'' says Butler.
</P>
<P>
   If the Big Five U.N. members are united, then military action
should not be necessary to enforce international law, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, who has just published a book ``Saddam Defiant'' on his
own frustrating experience as top weapons inspector, said that
``The world will never be the same'' if a missile loaded with nerve
gas were to hit Tel Aviv, a single canister of VX nerve gas were
released into the New York City subway system, or a single nuclear
explosion hollowed out central London.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is now faced with a tough policy decision on Iraq in the
coming weeks when the new disarmament body prepares to test Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's willingness to allow intrusive
inspections aimed at ensuring that he has given up the capacity to
build weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   If Iraq defies U.N. provisions by refusing entry to the U.N.
inspectors, the Security Council will once again have to decide
whether to take military action to force the sanctions-hit country
to comply with international law.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's last refusal to cooperate with UNSCOM inspectors led by
Butler prompted the United States and Britain to launch Operation
Desert Fox in December 1998. The two countries have kept up a
low-level bombing campaign in allied-patrolled ``no-fly'' zones
since that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a crunch in August,'' Butler predicted.
</P>
<P>
   That is when UNMOVIC, the new organization which he describes as
the ``sickly son of UNSCOM,'' will have recruited and trained up
its politically- and geographically-correct team of experts.
</P>
<P>
   They were mandated by the Security Council last December to
complete the elimination of Iraqi nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons, and long-range missiles capable of striking Iraq's
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM fell apart in the aftermath of Desert Fox, which split
the Security Council, amid accusations that UNSCOM was being used
by the U.S. and Israel for spying purposes, and was disturbing
Iraqi sensibilities through its ``cowboy'' methods.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, backed by Russia and China, continues to insist that it
has already complied with U.N. disarmament requirements and that
sanctions should be lifted forthwith. Baghdad has also warned that
it will not cooperate with UNMOVIC.
</P>
<P>
   Once the UNMOVIC teams, now led by former IAEA chief Hans Blix,
are up and running at the end of August, the Security Council will
have to decide whether to force the issue by attempting to send
them back to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, who is now diplomat in residence at the Council for
Foreign Relations in New York, says that Britain will come under
huge pressure in the Security Council from the Russians and
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will call for a shift in policy, then they can get
UNMOVIC in,'' he says. ``Russia, China and France say first lift
the sanctions on the promise to let the monitors in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice for the West is: will they take Iraq's word for
it?... And then the Council will have been conned,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that August is only three months ahead of the U.S.
presidential election, Butler says that the attitude of the other
hard-liner on Iraq in the Security Council cannot be predicted at
this stage.
</P>
<P>
   Washington seems somewhat disengaged on Iraq at present,
according to U.N. diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats commented that Butler may be premature in
predicting a new crisis with Iraq in August, and that the Security
Council may continue to sit on its hands when presented with the
new-look inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The current deadlock, under which Iraq is benefiting from a
loosened oil-for-food humanitarian program while receiving the
occasional bomb from a U.S. or British warplane, may actually
benefit all the players concerned, including Britain and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be surprised if the inspectors go back this side of
Christmas,'' one diplomat said. &QL;

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ With less than a week left before Mexico's
closest-ever presidential election, the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party is stripping down for action and going after
the female vote.
</P>
<P>
   A quintet of buff male dancers pranced in cowboy boots,
strutting their stuff and snapping their thongs for 15,000
shrieking women at a recent political rally on the outskirts of the
capital. The organizers had enticed poor urban housewives out in
record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes were on the message spelled out on the backsides of the
tight boxer shorts worn by ``The Sexy Boys'': VOTE FOR PRI! When
these, too, were cheekily flung away, the screams were almost
supersonic.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these women from the PRI stronghold of Mexico state,
which has 7.5 million potential voters, arrived six hours early to
secure an unobstructed view of the stage.
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from the dull PRI campaigns of the past. There
was no brass band wheezing tunes while a rent-a-crowd of day
laborers cheered the candidate's stilted speech, then waved his
convoy of flashy cars off to the next fly-blown town.
</P>
<P>
   A big banner for the PRI's presidential candidate, Francisco
Labastida, was prominently displayed as a backdrop while the
entertainers did their bumps and grinds. However, the silver-haired
technocrat did not attend as a speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like it in a Mexican political
campaign,'' said Josefina Franzoni, an analyst at the Mexican
Institute of Political Studies.
</P>
<P>
   When male strip shows first took Mexico by storm last summer,
National Action Party (PAN) stalwarts and right-wing Catholic
clergyman often were tempted to score political points by revoking
permits at the last minute in the name of public decency.
</P>
<P>
   This only added to the show's mystique, and one touring stud
cabaret, ``Solo Para Mujeres,'' set box-office records. In less
than a year, the ruling party has seized on the gimmick as a crowd
puller.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great that we can see nude men, but I would like to see
more political proposals,'' said Franzoni.
</P>
<P>
   Comprising 51 percent of Mexico's 59 million registered voters,
women can swing this tight election and they are being courted by
all candidates. Some four million households are headed by single
women, and they are changing the dynamics of the campaign.

   MEXICO CITY _ With less than a week left before Mexico's
closest-ever presidential election, the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party is stripping down for action and going after
the female vote.
</P>
<P>
   A quintet of buff male dancers pranced in cowboy boots,
strutting their stuff and snapping their thongs for 15,000
shrieking women at a recent political rally on the outskirts of the
capital. The organizers had enticed poor urban housewives out in
record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes were on the message spelled out on the backsides of the
tight boxer shorts worn by ``The Sexy Boys'': VOTE FOR PRI! When
these, too, were cheekily flung away, the screams were almost
supersonic.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these women from the PRI stronghold of Mexico state,
which has 7.5 million potential voters, arrived six hours early to
secure an unobstructed view of the stage.
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from the dull PRI campaigns of the past. There
was no brass band wheezing tunes while a rent-a-crowd of day
laborers cheered the candidate's stilted speech, then waved his
convoy of flashy cars off to the next fly-blown town.
</P>
<P>
   A big banner for the PRI's presidential candidate, Francisco
Labastida, was prominently displayed as a backdrop while the
entertainers did their bumps and grinds. However, the silver-haired
technocrat did not attend as a speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like it in a Mexican political
campaign,'' said Josefina Franzoni, an analyst at the Mexican
Institute of Political Studies.
</P>
<P>
   When male strip shows first took Mexico by storm last summer,
National Action Party (PAN) stalwarts and right-wing Catholic
clergyman often were tempted to score political points by revoking
permits at the last minute in the name of public decency.
</P>
<P>
   This only added to the show's mystique, and one touring stud
cabaret, ``Solo Para Mujeres,'' set box-office records. In less
than a year, the ruling party has seized on the gimmick as a crowd
puller.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great that we can see nude men, but I would like to see
more political proposals,'' said Franzoni.
</P>
<P>
   Comprising 51 percent of Mexico's 59 million registered voters,
women can swing this tight election and they are being courted by
all candidates. Some four million households are headed by single
women, and they are changing the dynamics of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's wife even went on a walkabout in one of Mexico
City's tough neighborhoods to speak on crime. ``She's the first
wife of a candidate with her own personality,'' said Miguel Acosta
of the Mexican Human-Rights Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls waver, but for the first time the authoritarian
PRI is facing a viable challenge in a transparent election process.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox, conservative candidate for an alliance of the PAN
and the Mexican Green Ecologists, has been riding high with his

MY LIFE AS A FUTURISTIC CURIO 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Originally scheduled as CIR-STEPHEN-KING) 
 (Circuits)  
 By DOUGLAS COOPER  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen King, as I'm sure you know, made headlines _ and a small
fortune _ when his e-novella, ``Riding the Bullet,'' was published
online in March. It was heralded as an innovation, the beginning of
a new era in publishing. A vision thing.
</P>
<P>
   People keep asking me, ``Are you bitter?'' After all, Stephen
King has made a vast chunk of cash ``pioneering'' a concept that I
pioneered almost eight years ago. No, I am not bitter.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, I published the opening chapter of my novel
``Delirium'' on Time Warner's Pathfinder site. It was, by a few
hours, the first novel ever serialized on the Web. Potentially, it
a decisive moment in the history of publishing.
</P>
<P>
   In my own bashful way, I wanted ``Cooper'' to be engraved _ with
the names Caxton and Gutenberg _ into the marble pediments of the
world's great libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Short of that, I would have settled for a soupcon of cash. The
deal, after all, was brokered by William Morris, my agent at the
time; and the publisher was Time Warner, now a minor subdivision of
AOL. The agency was properly greedy on my behalf. The deal had
taken ages to finesse because the world had never seen a contract
of this nature, and William Morris did not wish to be left holding
the short end of the precedent.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, I permitted myself to dream. I had some prior
success as a novelist. My first book, ``Amnesia,'' had been a best
seller in Canada (and I truly thank all six people who bought it).
But no, I was not a household name. Neither, however, was the Web
itself. Mosaic had just been introduced. Netscape was a dream, a
zygote. If you had suggested to anyone that AOL would someday buy
my publisher, you would have inspired wild chortling.
</P>
<P>
   I did receive a modest passel of fame. The book's release was
covered by Rolling Stone, and the precedent was acknowledged by The
Wall Street Journal, Japanese Esquire and the inaugural edition of
Wired UK. For what it's worth, the whole business earned me an
entry in ``alt.culture,'' an encyclopedia of the '90s. It called my
novel a ``futuristic curio.'' (I've been waiting for years to
return the favor: Check out its Web site, www.altculture.com. It's
what you might call a futuristic curio.)
</P>
<P>
   My publication date was not without drama. A few days earlier, I
had received word through my network of spies that Wired magazine
was working quickly to post the first installment of a Web novel on
Hotwired because it was hoping to beat me to the prize. I had
written for Wired, and it was hoping to thwart my one bid for
publishing history. The race was tense and very close: I beat Wired
by mere hours. It was a nice little victory, and I received a
gentlemanly e-mail message from the magazine, a slightly red-faced
admission of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Thus I became, accidentally, one of the world's first ``content
providers.'' Nobody much read my book, but the academy paid
attention. Brown University, home of Robert Coover's hypertext
project, would steer its students toward ``Delirium.'' When I
finally met Coover, long a hero to the literary avant-garde, he was
extremely kind. An important cultural theorist, Marshall Blonsky,
disapproved of my experiment. Luckily, he wrote his critique in
Italian, a language I do not read.
</P>
<P>
   When the finished novel was released in hardcover, however, the
critics championed my work. Critics, unfortunately, never actually
buy what they read. Peter Eisenman, an architect whose work is
perhaps even less accessible than mine, built a project based on
``Delirium'' for the Milan Triennale. An Italian publisher gave me
a contract. I felt as though I had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   I had arrived: six years early, penniless, in a bad suit. Then
along comes Stephen King, and the public downloads a half-million
copies of his petite novella within days of publication. Whenever
he receives press coverage for his groundbreaking venture _ acclaim
that inevitably fails to mention my precedential shovel work _
helpful friends call to ask me whether I am upset. No, I say, by
which I mean yes.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the dollars really matter. It's honor, not cash, that
drives this would-be prophet. Aristotle noted that no man values
fame undeserved. I sincerely doubt that I would enjoy the fame
associated with genre fiction. I simply wanted recognition for
having conducted a successful little world-historical experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it. I lost the numbers game to Stephen King long ago.
I meant to lose. You don't go into this field _ opaque, intestinal
metafiction _ to compete with Stephen King. We might as well be in
two entirely different trades, say, hog-tying and extermination.
Yes, I know that David Foster Wallace teaches the King oeuvre to
his students. I bow to his fashionable gesture, and wish him a
pleasant tenure. Nevertheless, art and entertainment rarely
coincide.
</P>
<P>
   I have always said that my sole ambition in life is to write
from the margins, a spectral presence acknowledged only by the
perverse. Recently _ it's true _ I have augmented this
thing-that-I-have-always-said with, Be careful what you ask for.
But the truth is, despite my whining, I am happy with the way
things worked out. I have my readers, and I'm told that all 12 of
them like my work very much. Nor does it bother me that 10 are
Bulgakov scholars, and two are feminist nuns. I consider that a
crossover success.

TAIWAN SUGGESTS IT COULD ACCEPT `ONE CHINA' POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Taiwan's new president this week said the magic words
more clearly than ever before, telling visitors that his government
could agree with China's government that there is only ``one
China.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added a condition that Beijing has said it cannot accept:
that Taiwan and China must each be able to interpret those words in
different ways.
</P>
<P>
   With his latest statement, President Chen Shui-bian, the former
opposition candidate and independence advocate who took office in
May, came tantalizingly close to a formula that might draw Beijing
into peace talks with the island it considers a breakaway province.
</P>
<P>
   A senior security aide in Taipei, Taiwan's capital, told
reporters that the statement, made Tuesday to visiting Americans
and reported in Wednesday's papers, was ``the new government's most
authoritative, sincere and goodwill policy statement.''
</P>
<P>
   What Chen said clearly for the first time is that his
administration could accept an approach that was successfully used
in 1992 to defuse the core dispute over Taiwan's political
relationship to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new government is willing to accept a consensus that there
is one China but each side could have its own interpretation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1992, with a similar ambiguous oral agreement about
Taiwan's political status, the two sides began fitful talks between
semi-official representatives. These were angrily ended by Beijing
last year when Taiwan's president at the time, Lee Teng-hui,
provocatively asserted that Taiwan and China had a ``state-to-state
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the charged atmosphere after the election victory by
Chen, each side claims to have a different memory of how the
sovereignty issue was finessed in 1992. While Beijing did not
immediately respond to Chen's latest remarks, Chinese officials
have said in recent weeks that they could never agree to multiple
interpretations of ``one China.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the word games is a fundamental chasm: most residents of
Taiwan want the island to keep its de facto independent status
while China insists, on threat of war, that Taiwan must agree to
rejoin the motherland, though it says it could do so with great
autonomy.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The history of architecture reaches back past the
palazzi and pyramids to the dawn of the lean-to. But humankind was
bested in its attempts to create a stylish habitat 500 million
years earlier by, of all things, an invertebrate. The lowly mollusk
should be credited with creating the world's first beach house in
the brilliant form of the seashell.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Gow, importer, creator of objets and consummate
handyman, would probably live in a seashell if he could. Long a fan
and student of whelks, conchs, periwinkles et al., he is also a
founder of Ruzzetti &AMP; Gow, a Manhattan company that gathers shells
around the world, silver-coats them in Rome and uses them to adorn
antique and contemporary chandeliers and furniture. Gow, 37, sells
seashells far from the seashore: this week, he is opening his first
boutique, at 162 East 74th Street in Manhattan. But he has also
converted a small apartment above a busy Midtown street into a
combination living space, atelier and beach house.
</P>
<P>
   While others take citified polish to the seaside, Gow, who grew
up in English coastal towns, made the reverse commute: he used the
rudest of materials _ castoff fabric, flea-market finds, staples,
glue and lots of shells _ to fashion an apartment that feels more
like a getaway than many Hamptons retreats. ``It's outrageous, some
of these places,'' he said. ``If you couldn't see the ocean, you'd
think you were in the middle of the city. The antiques hail from
18th-century royal palaces.'' The standard for beach-house decor,
he added, ``should be that if waves washed it all away, there
should be nothing lost where the financial value is greater than
the emotional value.''
</P>
<P>
   His own silver products are as polished as his own decor gets.
Even his walls are relaxed. Gow, a specialist in 19th-century
European sculpture at Sotheby's for the last decade, amassed
auction catalog after catalog, finally finding himself with a
mountain of records. In a simple, bold step, he stacked them above
a bookcase in his apartment, without aid of shelves. Eventually an
adjoining wall started to buckle, and the catalogs all shifted
precariously sideways. In design terms, his ``nonfunctional
library'' is a stunner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more structurally unsound it is the better, because it
enhances the herringbone effect,'' he said of his Leaning Tower of
Sotheby's. ``It really is moving, though, and I have a feeling
something is going to go bump in the night soon.'' In hopes of
forestalling the inevitable, he placed one of his heaviest
shell-encrusted mirrors on an ornate console table against the
great wall.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is his ingenious answer to the small, dreary terrace
off a studio apartment Gow also rents one floor up. ``I was at a
cocktail party at Princess Marina Pignatelli's,'' he explained,
``and I met this Australian man named Fabian Compton, and he told
me how he painted these trompe l'oeil rugs on people's floors. And
I told him I'd love to have a trompe l'oeil swimming pool.'' Now he
has one, with a ``deep end'' painted a deeper blue.
</P>
<P>
   Gow (rhymes with wow) studied art history and decorative arts in
France, but his is an Englishman's home, cozily filled with
furniture and bric-a-brac. Over 10 years, he has steadily brought
in all manner of furniture finds from street and flea market. He
asked Compton to stencil a trompe l'oeil kilim onto the sea grass
matting in his living room, which adds to the cozy sense of
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings am aspect of whimsy to decor,'' Gow said. It even
fooled his mother, Joan Gow, who during a recent visit from Kent,
England, tried to kick aside the ``rug'' to vacuum underneath.
</P>
<P>
   He installed an antique mantelpiece to create the illusion of a
fireplace. No problem was so big that it couldn't be covered up.
``That is some nasty thing covered with a drop cloth,'' he said,
pointing to the white living room sofa strewn with Moroccan
cushions.
</P>
<P>
   For his small study, Gow took a large piece of green silk he
found in the rubbish at Sotheby's _ it had been used to wrap a
sculpture from Japan _ and fashioned a harem-style ceiling with
nothing more than a wire hanger and a stapler. ``There's not one
terribly expensive thing in here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Except the silvered fruits de mer, which range from $50 for a
starfish to $1,300 for a 22-inch-long conch.
</P>
<P>
   Gow's love affair with water fauna dates at least to the time
when, at 13, he won a marine biology prize for a paper on limpets.
Now, shells fill jars in the kitchen, instead of food staples; they
pile up in dresser drawers, where linens and clothes would be; they
spill into the filing cabinet in the study. What was once the
dining room, and has been for five years the showroom, should
rightly be called the grotto. On almost every surface sit silvered
shells, sea urchins, starfish, pomegranates, ears of corn,
asparagus, apples.
</P>
<P>
   Artisans have been practicing this kind of craftsmanship on the
Italian peninsula since the days of the Roman Empire. The workshop
used by Gow has been operated by the same family for generations
and has for decades done restoration work on silver pieces for the
Vatican. In the last two years, following the tradition of the
Italian shell grottoes of the Baroque era, he began to decorate
furnishings, and has designed some wrought-iron tables and light
fixtures to resemble coral.
</P>
<P>
   All told, it's a transformation for a loft space that was
formerly a Korean massage parlor, complete with bulletproof door.
Before Gow started his renovation, the space had been divided only
by several rudimentary walls (by an artist named Peanut Butter).
More improvements were made by Gow's next roommate, an artist named
Herbert Hoover, who made kitchen chandeliers out of conduit and
bits of hardware. (His designs had a starring role in the film
``Runaway Bride,'' where they appeared as creations by Julia
Roberts' character.)
</P>
<P>
   Gow moved to New York after a stint working in Dallas as the
curator of the private art collection of the developer Trammell
Crow. He got an MBA at Southern Methodist University, and, in 1989,
began working at Sotheby's. In 1995, his good friend Giampiero
Ruzzetti came to town with a few seashells that had been silvered
in Rome and proposed that they begin selling the shells as a
sideline. The business took off, and Gow, who had studied
malacology _ the branch of zoology dealing with mollusks _ while
taking a degree in botany at Durham University in northern England,
now found himself in a crash course in international shell buying:
he wanted to take care, he said, to avoid trafficking in any shells
from endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   He was happier with his free-lance success than Sotheby's was.
``I remember I was up for my performance review, and they asked me
how I thought my sideline was going,'' he said. ``And I said, `Oh,
the shells?' And they said, `No, your work here at Sotheby's.'''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Gow left the company, having bought out Ruzzetti, who
kept the team's Miami apartment in exchange for his part of the
business. Gow began working from his West 37th Street apartment.
</P>
<P>
   He is flattered by the suggestion that he appears to share the
mollusk's talent for creating a comfortable, compelling environment
with what is more or less readily at hand. ``Except that a
mollusk's shell increases in size, and mine hasn't,'' he said.
``It's just grown inside with objects that have come and gone.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many of those objects are going to the new Ruzzetti &AMP; Gow store
and showroom, but enough arrangements will remain to form an
octopus's garden. His idea of home is a place where ``everything is
chosen to be stimulating to the eye, but also for comfort factor,''
he said, displaying an attitude toward decor that many English
people share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far less studied than many American rooms _ and far cozier
than European ones,'' David Hicks, the interior designer, wrote in
``The Englishman's Room'' of his countrymen's fondness for a
cosmopolitan collection of furniture, books and objects ``somehow
sympathetic to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Gow agrees. ``That's the beauty of English decorating: the
stylishness and comfort,'' he said. ``Too many American interiors
are too contrived and put together purely for aesthetic criteria.''

   While his precious shells have an almost kitschy element of
ostentation, Gow says they are not intended as such.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about bringing nature back into the environment,'' he
said. ``The silver heightens the contrasts, and it enhances the
texture of the outside, while the inside stays intact.''
</P>
<P>
   The silver is not meant to one-up nature, he said, but ``to
ennoble it.'`
</P>
<P>
   Knowing when to stop is important. ``Barbra Streisand wanted a
rose,'' Gow said. ``We had a courier hand-carry it back from Italy,
but it didn't pass quality control. We never even showed it to her.
There are very few cases in which we can improve on nature. Most
things are better left and appreciated as they are.''

GODARD'S MIX OF MOVIES AND MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 2) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The history of cinema parallels the history of recorded music in
that both have been concerned, since the necessary technical
discoveries were made at the end of the 19th century, with
composing in time: composing images, and later sounds, in film;
composing sounds alone where music is concerned. With a grand
inevitability, therefore, Jean-Luc Godard's four-and-a-half-hour
video ``Histoire(s) du Cinema'' presents itself also as, one might
say, ``Histoire(s) de la Musique,'' and it is fitting that the
soundtrack alone should be available. It comes from ECM (whose
moving spirit, Manfred Eicher, has long been a friend and
collaborator of the distinguished director) in the form of a
smartly packaged set, purchasable online through Barnes &AMP; Noble
(www.bn.com, $180). Five CD's are accompanied by four hardcover
volumes presenting Godard's text, in English and German as well as
the original French, with stills from the video.
</P>
<P>
   So persuasive is ``Histoire(s) du Cinema'' as a purely auditory,
musical phenomenon that these pictures prove curiously redundant,
though sometimes striking in themselves. Certainly, one does not
feel that anything is missing, for there is so much that is not.
The recording presents Godard's poetic narration _ nearly always
delivered in his own richly inflected voice, bronchial yet robust,
a musical instrument itself _ interspersed and overlapping with
snatches from movie soundtracks and musical recordings. Sometimes
there is, too, the sound of a manual typewriter: a nicely
old-fashioned touch, and useful in enhancing the effect of a
present time in which Godard is composing his text, while all
around him, on monitors and CD players in his studio, the history
of 20th-century culture is playing over. (The textual repetitions,
too, make it seem that one is hearing the conceiving rather than
the achieved conception.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet heard another way, the movies and the music come from an
eternal present, the land of Oz, while Godard's is the fragile
voice of the temporary. The voices of the Hollywood actors of the
1930s and '40s are forever young _ even Alfred Hitchcock, heard in
an interview, is not getting any older _ and the wordless voices
heard in Liszt's ``Faust Symphony'' or Schubert's ``Unfinished''
will never age. Godard's voice, though, comes from a particular
moment: a moment when joy at the ending of an old era in Europe,
that of the Cold War, had swiftly been replaced by anxieties as to
what sort of age was coming next.
</P>
<P>
   Distrust, in fact, rustles all through Godard's history or
histories, made over a 10-year period beginning in 1988. Speaking
of the birth of film, he tells how ``in the early morning of the
20th century, technologies decided to reproduce life ... but as
morality was still strong ... they wore mourning for this putting
to death, and it was in the colors of mourning, in black and white,
that the cinema came into existence.'' Nor does he become any more
sanguine about the later development of the genre to which he has
devoted his life, and in which, here, he is so much absorbed. There
are, he says at one point, only 10 films that make the grade. And
most of those would probably be French.
</P>
<P>
   Further on, in the last two of the four chapters into which
``Histoire(s) du Cinema'' is divided, Godard's pessimism seeps out
far beyond the bounds of the movie theater. ``Nations have
something over them that is beneath them,'' he says: governments.
He goes on to accuse governments of responsibility for letting
loose hatred in Europe, though his malaise is not just political
but, at root, philosophical. Yet at the end comes a straw of hope:
``If a man wandered through paradise in his dreams, and kept a
flower to remind him where he'd been, and on waking found that
flower in his hands _ so what can I say? I was that man.''
</P>
<P>
   Godard's despair is moderated by the care and urgency with which
he speaks: the sense in everything he says that cinema matters, but
people matter more, and cinema matters at all only in that it
creates moments that, because of how much and how intensely they
mean, one has to call real.
</P>
<P>
   Talking of Hitchcock in the spaced-out fourth chapter, where the
froth of film and music clips has largely subsided, Godard says
``we've forgotten why Joan Fontaine leans over the edge of the
cliff and what it was that Joel McCrea was going to do in
Holland,'' and so on, ``but we remember a handbag, but we remember
a bus in the desert, but we remember a glass of milk.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``Histoire(s) du Cinema'' special, though, is not so
much the substance of Godard's eulogy-diatribe, nor even its poetic
fireworks, but rather the beautifully produced and edited flux of
words and music. Right at the start, an enigmatic utterance by
Godard _ ``Change nothing, so that all can be different'' _ makes
perfect sense as a verbal equivalent to a quotation from a
Hindemith piano piece in which a simple phrase is varied and
extended but always comes back to the same emphasized note. Later,
but still within the first chapter, ``Le Sacre du Printemps'' is
tellingly intercut with Looney Tunes music, and the heroic ring of
a movie actor is matched by that of a Puccini tenor.
</P>
<P>
   Godard and Eicher provide only the skimpiest indication of the
music included and no key to the films, presumably because they
want ``Histoire(s) du Cinema'' to be heard not as a compendium but
as itself, a composition in sound, where speaking voice folds into
orchestra, movie into music, creating an aural river one can enjoy
as it comes and remember, like those Hitchcock films, for its
instants of illumination.

 &HT;    Patriotic times are a changin'
 &HT;    By Stephen J. O'Brien
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ If today was a cold December day in 1941, Henry
Flores III might be at the Army recruiting offices in Waco for
another reason.
</P>
<P>
   But today is a hot June afternoon in 2000. At the Texas Army
National Guard headquarters, Flores signs up to be an American
soldier one weekend a month and two weeks a year. The 23-year-old
native of Waco says he is proud to be serving his country, but the
main reasons for becoming a citizen soldier have little to do with
battlefield glory or defending American Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great deal,'' Flores said of the Army's tuition
reimbursement plan for college students. ``It'll help me pay for
school and I can be a positive role model for my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   At previous times in American history, like the war years of the
early 1940s, Flores' decision to serve his country likely would
have been made for another reason: to defend the United States.
Without question, his decision would have been considered
patriotic, a measure of what it truly means to be American.
</P>
<P>
   But much like the reasons many young men and women join the
military today, patriotic times are changing.
</P>
<P>
   Things that have traditionally defined patriotism seem to be
second thoughts in the 21st century. Cynicism about government is
at an all-time high. Voter turnout remains historically low. Flag
Day gets about as much attention as national bottled-water week.
And getting out of jury duty is practically a national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what you mean by patriotism _ how pleased you are
with the direction of the country and how much you participate in
the political process _ then you have to say it's going down,''
said Donald Greco, director of the American Studies Program at
Baylor University. ``And if you define it by what people are
willing to do to express their love for America, like raising a
flag, that's probably down, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Other scholars agree: These commonly accepted signs of
patriotism have declined since the war years of the mid-20th
century. Many of those same experts, however, say that things like
flag waving, fervor for American military might, and participation
in the political process don't always tell the whole story.
Patriotism comes in different forms these days.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Brinkley, director of the Eisenhower Center for American
Studies at the University of New Orleans, said today's America is
much different and more complex than the America of the 1700s,
1800s and early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that patriotism simply means waving the flag is
inherently flawed, Brinkley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patriotism is in your heart, not on your sleeve,'' Brinkley
said. ``Some of the greatest patriots have been those who challenge
the government, the direction the country is going. Our founding
fathers were dissidents. There were the flies in the ointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a good American is to put the interest of the country
first _ even if your viewpoint is unpopular, he said. Protests
during the Vietnam War, for example, were seen as unpatriotic to
many Americans, but pushing for change in hopes of making the
country a better place is every bit as American and every bit as
patriotic, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no more unpatriotic act than to call someone
unpatriotic for expressing their beliefs,'' Brinkley said. ``Some
kid with long hair who's trying to save the great red woods is
someone who wants them to be around for future generations. He
cares about the country, but he's not more or less patriotic than
someone who works at a lumber mill and has a bumper sticker that
says, 'America: love it or leave it.' They're expressing their love
for the country in different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   If Americans truly are less boastful about being American these
days, some scholars say that's because the U.S. is stable
politically, militarily and economically. Competing super powers in
previous times now seem to work more in concert with each other,
argues University of Georgia professor Betty Jean Craige, author of
``American Patriotism in a Global Society.'' That has put the
concept of patriotism in transition, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional concept of patriotism meant the promotion of
your country in competition with other countries,'' said Craige,
who directs the university's Center for Humanities and Arts. ``The
old definition was militaristic and bellicose. The best thing to do
as an American was to die for your country. The emerging concept _
and one I would encourage people to embrace _ is to make your
country a good country in the community of nations. I think we're
now moving into this wholistic understanding of the interdependence
of countries throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   With a larger sense of concern for the entire global community,
flag waving isn't as common as it once was, Craige said. Parading
the Stars and Stripes, in many respects, is a tribalistic ritual,
reflecting a belief in America vs. the world. But many Americans
today, while still proud of their heritage, understand that the
U.S. is part of a larger picture, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think to some people flying the flag is a sign. It indicates
a kind of belief that our nation is over others,'' she said. ``I
think now at the turn of the 21st century, we can see a tension
between the political right, in which patriotism is defined as
loyalty to the U.S. and in opposition of other countries, and the
more globally oriented side.''
</P>
<P>
   But a declining sense of national pride to make way for this
globalism also has its negative side effects, according to some
historians. A portion of American society has embraced the
individual about the collective good of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon of ``my rights before the greater good'' has to
do, in part, with the declining sense that all Americans are on the
same team in a monumental struggle against outside evils. Experts
also point to a modern culture that fosters consumerism before
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not to say that it's right or wrong, but Americans
don't seem to identify with their larger community like they did in
the past,'' said Greco, of Baylor's center for American studies.
``It's an attitude that says, 'As long as it doesn't affect me, who
cares.' That could lead to individual rights destroying the pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Armistead, a professor of American history at Baylor, said
previous generations could easily see the need to come together
because American life was at stake. What it meant to be patriotic
was simpler, said Armistead, who served in the U.S. Navy during the
Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   His father served on the Western Front in World War I and was
awarded three battle stars for heroics during World War II.
Armistead's brother was captured by Nazis during the Battle of the
Bulge and served four months as a prisoner of war in 1945 before
being freed.
</P>
<P>
   After the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, lines at
military recruiting offices went on for miles. Business owners
proudly converted their factories to make war materials. Stateside
Americans rationed everything from food to rubber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any great lack of patriotism today,'' Armistead
said. ``I think you might see a more sophisticated view of it all.
In the early days of the Republic, the saying was, 'My country
right or wrong.' It's much different now.''
</P>
<P>
   Armistead supports the view that Americans should see themselves
as part of a larger whole, but embracing this new form of
patriotism should not replace the pride and respect people have for
those things uniquely American.
</P>
<P>
   Flag waving, going to Fourth of July parades and singing the
national anthem should remain a rich part of life in America,
Armistead and others said. Citizens also should exercise the rights
_ like voting, jury duty, civic involvement _ that make the United
States the most free country in the world, said Joe Cavanaugh,
director of the Admiral Nimitz Museum in Fredericksburg.
</P>
<P>
   Being patriotic also encompasses being aware of the country's
history and remembering the people who sacrificed to preserve those
rights for today's America and the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people no longer pay attention to history we lose sight
of the past. When that happens we lose sight of ourselves,''
Cavanaugh said. ``To 'stop and remember' is part of our patriotic
duty.''

   Domesticated Texas Bluebells
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've loved Lisianthus in florists' arrangements, so I bought
a potted one. But now I realize that I know nothing about the
plant. It seems to need a lot of water because it wilts readily. I
assume it's an annual. Can it be planted outside? Does it bloom
constantly?
</P>
<P>
   A. Lisianthus russellianus is another name for Eustoma
grandiflorum, the prairie gentian, or Texas bluebell, originally a
wildflower of the Western plains.
</P>
<P>
   Of course you can plant it outside. You can plant anything
outside, temporarily, anyway. Choose a spot in full but not
broiling sun where the soil is neutral to slightly alkaline, well
drained and not too rich. Be careful when transplanting, the
delicate taproot resents disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   Feed sparingly and water only when the soil is dry an inch down.
Unless it has outgrown its pot, there's a good chance your plant is
wilting because it's too wet, rather than the reverse. Lisianthus
is vulnerable to a wide range of fungi, molds and bacteria, all of
which thrive in damp conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Prairie gentian is a slow-growing annual (or biennial grown as
an annual) that will flower for two months or more, depending on
the variety. Frost will kill it, but by then it will probably be
all bloomed out.
</P>
<P>
   Until about 20 years ago, if you could find Lisianthus at all,
you could count on it to be 2 to 3 feet tall and a third as wide,
with single pale purple flowers. These days, there are many
variants, often sold without descriptive labels. You can get
doubles. You can get them in rose, white, blue or picotee. You can
also get much smaller plants. If yours has Lisa or Mermaid in its
name, it will never be more than about 8 inches tall.
</P>
<P>
   They'll Be Sorry
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have read that cayenne pepper can be used to ward off
squirrels. How does it work? Are the peppers hung like tree
ornaments? Sprinkled on the ground? I tried using camphor balls
around the plants, but the neighbors complained about the smell and
when I last looked the squirrels were thriving.
</P>
<P>
   A. The active ingredient is capsaicin (pronounced cap-SAY-sin),
the chemical that makes hot peppers hot. It burns anything it
touches and is particularly excruciating on the sensitive membranes
in mammalian eyes, noses and mouths. Birds appear to be unaffected;
capsaicin is used as a coating for birdseed to discourage squirrel
raids.
</P>
<P>
   To defend against rabbits, squirrels, deer and muggers, you can
buy commercial repellents that contain pure capsaicin, or you can
make a kitchen cupboard version. One formula calls for mixing { cup
finely chopped jalapenos or the much hotter habaneros with { gallon
of water. Boil for 20 minutes, strain and use as a spray. Be sure
to use gloves while working with the peppers. Keep the pot covered,
let it cool covered and don't inhale the vapors; hot or cold, they
are highly volatile and can burn.
</P>
<P>
   You can also just buy large quantities of ground cayenne and,
observing the same caution, sprinkle it on the cherished items.
Either way, the pepper will have to be reapplied at least once a
week and after every heavy dew or rain.
</P>
<P>
   It is not as foolproof as it sounds. You have to assure contact;
vapors dissipate rapidly, and the smell alone won't do it. Many
animals rapidly become used to, if not fond of, spicy food. And
it's easy to forget and get burned yourself, especially if you
touch the protected plant and then rub your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   That's primarily how it works against squirrels, by the way.
They rub their faces with their peppery paws and wind up in agony.
But squirrels are not stellar learners; some of them make the
connection and some don't.
</P>

THE MAKERS OF TV ARE HAPPY TO MINE THEIR OWN BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 2)  
 By HILARY DE VRIES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years ago, Brandon Tartikoff, the legendary NBC programming
chief, proposed the Hollywood equivalent of building oneself a
pyramid: A television series based on his own life. The former
network president, who had overseen such hits as ``Cheers,''
``Seinfeld'' and ``Law and Order'' during his decade-long tenure at
NBC, felt the time was right for a prime-time version of
``Network,'' the 1976 Oscar-nominated satire of the television news
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brandon realized people were spending more time watching TV
than any other single activity with the exception of doing their
own jobs,'' says Jerry Offsay, president of programming at Showtime
Networks, which bought Tartikoff's proposal. ``He felt audiences
had a new interest in the twists and turns behind running a
network.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Tartikoff, who died of Hodgkin's disease in 1997, did
not live to see his series reach the air, Showtime's ``Beggars and
Choosers,'' an hour comedy about the embattled president of a
fictional flagging network, reflects his vision. When the series
(which began its second season this past week) had its premiere
last year, critics hailed it as an intelligent, smartly written
adult ``dramedy'' _ the first series since HBO's comedy ``The Larry
Sanders Show'' to take a satirical behind-the-scenes look at the
television industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brandon wanted to go beyond `Larry Sanders,''' says the
executive producer of ``Beggars and Choosers,'' Peter Lefcourt, who
developed the series with Tartikoff. ``He wanted to do `Network'
for the '90s and examine the whole landscape of TV programming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beggars and Choosers'' _ the title refers to the buyers and
sellers in the television market _ is the story of Rob Malone
(Brian Kerwin), an earnest if beleaguered network president not
unlike Tartikoff. In charge of programming for the faltering
fourth-place LGT network, Malone has a glamorous socialite wife,
Cecile (Isabella Hoffman), not unlike Tartikoff's widow, Lily, who
serves as a producer on the series; two precocious children and a
pressure-cooker job where he battles doublecrossing agents,
demanding stars and egotistical producers as well as his own
not-to-be-trusted staff, headed by his back-stabbing development
head, Lori Volpone (Charlotte Ross), modeled on the exploitive
programmer played by Faye Dunaway in ``Network.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Malone fought off sagging ratings by airing the
controversial ``Mountainmen,'' a ``Survivor''-like smash about a
group of vigilante wilderness-dwellers that stirred protest among
African-Americans and feminists demanding the inclusion of
Mountainblackmen and Mountainwomen. This season, Malone confronts
the network's eccentric new owners, a brash dot-com billionaire,
played by Beau Bridges, and his hard-partying nephew, played by Jim
Belushi.
</P>
<P>
   If these sound like plot lines ripped from the headlines, the
dialogue on the series is equally up to the minute. Episodes are
rife with offhand references to the overnights _ Malone wakes every
day to hear the overnight Nielsen ratings _ option year, MOW and
22-episode guarantee. Such inside-baseball terms would have been
beyond the understanding of viewers of ``The Dick Van Dyke Show''
40 years ago, when TV-industry verisimilitude extended only as far
as a late-night sketch-writing session or a trip to the woodshed
with the dyspeptic producer, Alan Brady.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only series I've worked on where we don't need a
technical adviser,'' says Lefcourt, a novelist (his works include
``The Deal,'' a black comedy about Hollywood that he referred to as
a ``cult hit'') and an Emmy-award winning producer whose credits
include ``Cagney and Lacey'' and ``Our Family Honor.'' ``Not only
do we all know this world, but we don't have to explain things like
Nielsen ratings for the audience. Everyone just gets it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bombarded by entertainment news, viewers today are increasingly
hip to Hollywood's ways, and box-office grosses, Nielsen ratings
and even the ``Friends'' contract renegotiation are water-cooler
topics. Now, prime-time producers are getting in on the act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audiences are much more media savvy today,'' Lefcourt said.
``We've also reached the saturation point with medical and legal
shows. The television industry offers a rich body of new stories
that have so far been untapped because of a fear that audiences
don't want to demythologize Hollywood. But that's changing.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, TV series about TV have been around since the industry
began. From ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' in the 1960s to ``The Mary
Tyler Moore Show'' in the 1970s to ``Murphy Brown'' in the 1980s,
such series have been a consistent if lesser part of the prime-time
landscape. Now, fueled by the newly media-savvy audiences as well
as the explosive growth of the cable industry, the genre seems to
be picking up steam. From ``Beggars and Choosers'' to NBC's new
teen drama, ``MYOB'' which is rife with insider references to
series like ``Friends'' and ``Law and Order'') as well as the
recently canceled comedy ``Sports Night'' and last season's
``Action,'' the number of series set in the entertainment industry
is increasing. The trend even extends to children's programming,
with the Disney Channel drama ``The Famous Jett Jackson,'' about a
15-year-old TV star who leaves Hollywood and moves to rural North
Carolina in order to lead a normal life. This fall ``Grosse
Pointe'' will have its debut on the fledgling WB network. A parody
of the long-running teen soap ``Beverly Hills, 90210,'' it is
expected to be the most visible of these entertainment-based shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``My idea was to do a teen-aged `Larry Sanders,' because there's
a level of subversive humor that audiences will understand today,''
said Darren Star, the creator of ``Grosse Pointe'' as well as
``Beverly Hills, 90210'' and ``Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of being in on it, of offering viewers a
behind-the-scenes look at these entertainment worlds, is very
popular now,'' added Stacey Lynn Koerner, vice president for
broadcast research at TN Media, the media-buying arm of True North
Communications. ``Whether it's `Murphy Brown' or `Sports Night' or
`Grosse Pointe,' audiences like to feel they're on the inside.''

<P>
   With its topicality and insider's tone, ``Beggars and Choosers''
has helped lead the charge. Already it's become the flagship series
for Showtime, as ``The Larry Sanders Show'' did at HBO in 1992.
``It's the best series we've put on the air,'' said Offsay, who
adds that the show has earned the cable channel new respect within
the Hollywood community. ``Agents are now sending us producers and
series that they never would have sent us before.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its success with critics, ``Beggars and Choosers,'' like
the majority of series about television, has yet to become a
break-out hit. ``The Larry Sanders Show'' never lured significant
audiences to HBO notwithstanding its critical accolades and
numerous Emmy nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ``Hiller and Diller,'' a 1997 sitcom about sitcom writers
played by Kevin Nealon and Richard Lewis, was shortlived. Last
season, two acclaimed, high-profile comedies about the
entertainment industry, ABC's ``Sports Night'' and Fox's
``Action,'' also failed in the ratings. ``Beggars and Choosers''
has generated plenty of buzz but not many viewers. ``It's still a
loss leader for Showtime,'' said Lefcourt, who suggests the series'
new time period, on Tuesday evenings, should improve viewership.
``We're getting a lot of attention in the big cities, but we've yet
to penetrate the podunks.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Despite the sharpened appetite for all things pertaining to
Hollywood, questions persist about the broad, popular appeal of
series set in the entertainment industry. With their cynical
attitudes and frequently disagreeable characters _ epitomized by
the narcissistic, egocentric Larry Sanders of Gary Shandling _ such
series are still considered risky when it comes to wooing
mainstream viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audiences are different today, and because we are a young, new
network with primarily a young viewership, we can take these kind
of programming risks,'' said Suzanne Daniels, president of
entertainment for WB, which will show ``Grosse Pointe.'' ``But even
so, I was initially very skeptical about this kind of satirical
comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Offsay of Showtime said: ``Shows about cops, doctors and lawyers
still have one big advantage over shows about television: They deal
with real life-and-death issues. You only have to compare Jimmy
Smits dying on `NYPD Blue' with a story line about an actress who
might not get a role to understand why traditional dramas still
succeed.''

A CULT OF COMPARISON AND A MUSICAL GLUT 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD HOLLAND    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the news is true, the record business is not being nice to
classical music. The Washington Post reports that such respected
labels as RCA Red Seal, Deutsche Harmonia Mundi and Melodiya, all
owned or distributed by the international giant BMG, will be either
shunted aside as minor activities of the American, pop-oriented RCA
label or put out of business altogether.
</P>
<P>
   We do know that two of BMG Classics' busiest stars have been
left dangling. Evelyn Glennie, the Scottish percussionist,
generates enormous amounts of publicity because of her prowess and
her struggles against deafness; James Galway, the Irish flutist,
has ravished the sensible-shoe set for a generation. Yet Glennie
has had her contract cut off without warning, and Galway's will not
be renewed. The New York Times offers the further news (disputed by
BMG Entertainment) that BMG Classics will not be recording at all
outside this country.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, the hand-wringing has stirred up a breeze, and
fingers are pointing every which way, often down in the direction
of the bottom line. Never or rarely moneymakers, classical
recordings have, quite frankly, been an object of charity in the
marketplace. If pop-music profits made the cup run over, the
producers of Beethoven and Brahms were there to catch the runoff.
Record companies are no longer as responsive, and it is easy and
sometimes proper to censure their crassness.
</P>
<P>
   Those not overburdened with culture have a hard time
understanding why their increasingly hard-earned net income should
be squandered on enterprises that sell 15,000 to 20,000 copies at
most, as against the millions generated by Ricky Martin. But shake
your fists at record companies all you want; they are reacting
indirectly to a bigger problem: The nature of classical music as it
has come to be.
</P>
<P>
   Popular music is predicated on the attractions of newness, the
current classical business on the attractions of oldness. Taken at
face value, the comparison is unfair. The newness of the Ricky
Martin single has planned obsolescence _ a short, fast-moving shelf
life _ built in. And although many of the world's interesting new
musical impulses are coming from anywhere but high-art sources, the
broad floods of pop releases are as quick and forgettable as summer
fireflies.
</P>
<P>
   New classical composers aspire to music that is built to last.
They are the inheritors of a 19th-century masterpiece syndrome that
linked quality with permanence and durability. And maybe their
products have both. But the problem is the public, which is not
buying their records.
</P>
<P>
   It is admirable and necessary that foundations of one kind or
other are helping to commit living composers to compact disc. The
fact that the general public isn't rushing to buy books on the
latest archaeological dig or genome discovery, or, for that matter,
recordings of the latest chamber music of Wayne Peterson, doesn't
mean that essential artifacts to a continuing culture shouldn't be
propped up by donors and universities.
</P>
<P>
   But in the record business, philanthropy and industry have
become hopelessly confused. With pop-music income under threat,
corporate high-mindedness toward releases that people buy only in
pitiful numbers has understandably weakened.
</P>
<P>
   The classical end has managed up to now by recording the
standard repertory and then recording it again. If the recordings
are old enough, they qualify as mythical voices from a distant
past. The technical imperfections are cleaned up, and releases are
repackaged and set out in bins next to the standard repertory
freshly recorded and the standard repertory recorded not so long
ago. They add up.
</P>
<P>
   Classical music on records is in trouble not because the BMG
labels are being martyred by bad guys in fancy offices; it is the
victim of a self-induced glut. In the early LP days, the
proliferation of recordings created healthy competition among
performances of the same piece. This stimulated listeners up to a
point. But faced now with 50 choices of the Beethoven Seventh
Symphony, customers _ even those who might want to own 5 to 10
versions _ are terminally embarrassed by such riches and walk away
in despair.
</P>
<P>
   And the question lurks: After all the great orchestras and
conductors of recent times have recorded their deathless
interpretations of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony, what more is
there to say about this piece? Ardent connoisseurs will argue for
the great new revelation to come and keep on listening and
comparing. Frankly, I know how the Beethoven Seventh goes, and the
ideal performance of it is in my head.
</P>
<P>
   If one good thing comes out of this worrisome affair, it may be
a forced re-examination of classical music's cult of comparison.
The explosion of information produced by the long-playing record
and the compact disc is of infinite value, but with it has come a
new and, for me, unsettling way of listening.
</P>
<P>
   My latest information on the BMG ruckus comes from a summary
report in the front pages of a new magazine, International Record
Review. Thumbing through its subsequent pages, one discovers
potential contributors to the problems the front of the magazine
reports on.
</P>
<P>
   I am in awe of these writers as they juggle 50 years or more of
recorded history, weighing the sound of versions A to Y against
version Z, noting timings, bristling at cuts in the score or
failures to make them. The knowledge of past performances and the
energy with which it is pursued paints pictures for me of people at
home in the midst of vast electrical apparatuses _ stopwatch in one
hand, urtext in the other _ endlessly crisscrossing between the
Mengelberg and the Furtwaengler tempo, or the Heifitz and the Elman
rubato.
</P>
<P>
   What a horrifying way to listen to music. Necessary, perhaps, in
that publications like this are a kind of Consumer Reports, aimed
at setting the potential buyer on the right course, but horrifying
nonetheless. I also suspect that the erudite justifications for
opinions arrived at are in fact unwitting responses to personal
instinct. And why shouldn't they be? Neither critics nor the
performers we write about are persuaded in the end by scholarly
proof; we manipulate proofs to accommodate what is in our hearts,
and that was often fixed inside us by our earliest experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Comparison, of course, is part of the process. Every new thing
that enters our heads collides with what is already there. Yet the
comparisons bred of 50 recordings of the Beethoven Seventh poison
the listening experience. Those who come away from Carnegie Hall
grumbling that they heard the Beethoven Seventh conducted at better
tempos in 1954 and with better brass playing a few years later have
wasted their evening.
</P>
<P>
   This is a plea not for recorded music, which will find its way,
but for the unencumbered ear, cleaned out for every night in the
concert hall or in front of the record player. Give your favorite
interpretation from the past an evening off. Compare as little as
you can. Make this experience as new as possible. If we don't get
back to hearing freshly, we shall soon find ourselves never hearing
the Beethoven Seventh Symphony again, only performances of it.
</P>

A SUMMERTIME SUCCESS STORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 2) 
 By ROSLYN SULCAS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1983, Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux, recently retired as a principal
dancer with the New York City Ballet, was asked to take charge of
the summer ballet school at the Chautauqua Institution, a gated
community of 225 acres along the shore of Chautauqua Lake, in the
northwest corner of New York State. The oldest summer arts festival
in America _ last year its 125th anniversary was commemorated in
``Chautauqua: An American Utopia,'' published by Harry N. Abrams _
Chautauqua was founded as an educational center in 1874 and soon
incorporated musical and dramatic performances. It boasted a
resident symphony orchestra, opera and drama companies, attendant
music, theater and art schools, but almost no dance, apart from the
fledgling school that catered mostly to the children of festival
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnefoux and his wife, the celebrated Balanchine ballerina
Patricia McBride, had made guest appearances at Chautauqua in the
'70s and remembered the idyllic lakeside setting and wonderful
atmosphere as they performed to a rapt crowd in an enormous
open-air amphitheater. Bonnefoux accepted the offer and, 18 years
later, can be justly proud of his achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Summer by summer, he has transformed the school into one that
attracts some of the country's best ballet students, with alumni
like Alexandra Ansanelli and Sebastian Marcovici, now soloists at
New York City Ballet. He has also made dance an integral part of
Chautauqua's artistic program by forming a professional summer
company that presents both new choreography and work from the
classical repertory _ thus extending his activities as artistic
director of the North Carolina Dance Theater in Charlotte, where he
and McBride spend the other 10 months of the year. This year, the
Chautauqua dance program (which started June 29 and ends on Aug.
12) offers eight performances in the 5,000-seat amphitheater,
accompanied by the Chautauqua Symphony, conducted by Akira Endo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dance program has come on light years,'' said Chautauqua's
president, Daniel Bratton, who began his tenure in 1984. ``It's
incredible to have people of the caliber of Jean-Pierre, Patty and
Violette Verdy working here, and it's through their sheer
determination that it has happened.'' Bonnefoux's enthusiasm and
ambitions must have been clear from the outset: In his first year
running the summer school, he took along two former New York City
Ballet principals and colleagues, Verdy and Helgi Tomasson, as well
as the School of American Ballet's Andre Kramarevsky, to teach with
him.
</P>
<P>
   He also immediately began to present work in public. ``From the
outset, I wanted to groom the dancers to perform, to be seen on
stage,'' he said. ``You can't wait for them to be `ready.''' A
donation, two years later, that enabled the building of the new
Carnahan-Jackson studios, which incorporated a performance space,
gave an additional boost to student presentations, often
choreographed by Bonnefoux, ``because I couldn't afford anyone
else!''
</P>
<P>
   By 1989, the success of the dance school was such that he was
able to convince the institution that it wouldn't cost a great deal
of money to establish a small professional company. (``I'm not sure
how I did that,'' he said, wryly.) Since then, every year 14 to 20
dancers, some of them former students, some selected by audition or
word of mouth, have come from all over the United States to form a
temporary troupe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jean-Pierre's idea was that we could employ dancers who are
laid off over the summer,'' McBride said, ``and it has worked
beautifully. They are paid, their housing and food taken care of,
and they have the chance to work with wonderful teachers,
choreographers and musicians.''
</P>
<P>
   One of these teachers is Verdy (now head of the dance department
at Indiana University), who has returned to Chautauqua every year
since 1983 and works with both the professional company and the
students. ``If one believes that art is excellence and leads to
spiritual understanding, then that's what you have in Chautauqua,''
she said. ``It's a cultural oasis; there are people who have been
going for generations.'' (In fact, the return rate at Chautauqua,
according to Marty Merkley, the director of programming, is around
80 percent, and the institution does little aggressive
self-promotion, which explains how a festival attracting 140,000
people annually remains so little known.)
</P>
<P>
   Verdy said that although the caliber of the students has
improved greatly, the emphasis has always been on ``giving the
students a sense of what it is like to perform, how to give
something an audience wants to buy a ticket for.''
</P>
<P>
   This accent on performing makes Chautauqua somewhat different
from most summer schools: Although the students (divided into two
groups: The advanced ``festival'' level, 14 to 17 years old, and
the ``workshop'' level, 11 to 13 years old) have a full program of
daily ballet, jazz and modern classes _ with an extra point work
and variation class in the afternoon for the older girls _ the
focus of their stay in Chautauqua is learning and rehearsing the
ballets that they will perform before an audience. W E always try
to do Balanchine with both the students and the company,'' McBride
said, ``because it's the best way for them to progress; it really
takes them a step higher. The Balanchine Trust has been wonderful
about granting permission: We've done `Stars and Stripes,' `The
Four Temperaments,' `Rubies,' `Western Symphony,' `Donizetti
Variations' and `Valse Fantasie,' and this year we're doing
`Allegro Brillante' for the company and `Raymonda Variations' for
the older students.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to learning the Balanchine repertory from firsthand
sources, both the students and professional dancers work with
invited choreographers on entirely new pieces. Over the years,
Bonnefoux has invited a broad range of choreographers to
Chautauqua, including Peter Pucci, Alonso King, Graham Lustig, Lynn
Taylor-Corbett and John Clifford, who has returned 10 times and has
created some 20 ballets there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful place to work,'' Clifford said. ``Everything
is completely open, so people watch rehearsals, you see them the
morning after the performance, and you get a lot of feedback.
Balanchine always said that ballet is a craft as well as an art,
and Chautauqua is a place to really work on your craft. You usually
have one week to choreograph, one week to rehearse, and then
they're onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last five years, Bonnefoux has also invited the former
Martha Graham principals Terese Capucilli, Donlin Foreman and
Jacqulyn Buglisi, of the Buglisi/Foreman Dance Company, to teach
and present their own work in studio performances. ``We work our
schedules around getting to Chautauqua,'' Buglisi said. ``For us,
there is an incredible connection to the audience there, and it's
very satisfying to try to bring aspects of physicality to the
students that ballet coaching doesn't cover.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Bonnefoux has also invited a number of dancers and
musicians from India, Africa, China and the Caribbean to take part
in an evening of world dance, ``to really show people what
diversity exists.'' The rest of the program includes a piece by
Bonnefoux and premieres by Christian Holder, Mark Goddon and the
resident choreographer, Mark Diamond in a salon evening set to
chamber music pieces, a pas de deux program of mostly new works
(one of these by an 18-year-old former student, Jessica Miller),
the Balanchine ballets, and a full-length ``Cyrano de Bergerac'' by
Diamond, who is also on the faculty of the North Carolina Dance
School.
</P>
<P>
   A full-evening work with 14 dancers and students? ``We've done
`Swan Lake,' `Sleeping Beauty' and `Coppelia' in the past,''
Bonnefoux said. ``We have no fear.''

INTENTIONS ARE GOOD, BUT PAYMENTS ARE EASY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have never been one to flirt with the pleasures of
self-denial. If I gave up something, it was usually someone else's
idea. Saying goodbye to a favorite doll whose chemically treated,
artificial hair gave me a rash was my mother's idea. Come to think
of it, that woman also masterminded the campaigns to purge
chocolate, nail biting and no-handed wheelies from my life.
</P>
<P>
   But I made my own decision to bid farewell to eBay a few months
ago. Maybe it was because I caught myself cutting back on groceries
to pay for such purchases as salt and pepper shakers shaped like
ears of corn. Or maybe it was because I realized that the (other)
bidders resembled characters in a Joseph Heller novel, obsessed
shoppers doomed to sell the same Hummel figurines and Squealer
beanie babies to one another for the rest of their lives. If you
think about it, how many Seals and Crofts songbooks could have been
printed in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   So when bad publicity hit eBay, the online auction house, last
spring and forced it to suspend the sale of a painting whose price
may have been inflated by shill bidding, I knew that I was clean. I
felt smug knowing I would never again bid, and never again have to
wait 20 minutes in a post office line to purchase a $21.17 money
order to pay for Fire King dinner plates.
</P>
<P>
   I have no theories about why certain people have addictive
personalities or what sets them off. But if you do, I would like to
hear them because last week I broke my vows. Well, partly. Although
it may be true that I (1) bid on eBay and (2) bought Fire King
dinner plates, I would like to point out that I did not (3) stand
in line at the post office to get a money order.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I paid for my fix instantly, using a new online payment
system called PayPal, a free service from X.com. It enabled me to
send a $26 credit card payment via e-mail to the seller. (For
sellers who do not have an account, PayPal opens one for them and
deposits the money. Then the sellers visit PayPal.com to complete a
simple registration process.)
</P>
<P>
   That same day the plate seller informed me that my order was in
the mail. There would be no weeklong delay waiting for a check to
clear or for a money order to navigate the postal system.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty is that you can send money _ real money, not one of
those gimmicky Internet currencies that can be spent only at a few
partners' sites _ to anyone with an e-mail address. You pay either
by credit card or from a bank account, which you register when you
open an account. The payment is credited to the seller's account,
and the seller can leave it there or withdraw it by requesting
either a check or bank transfer.
</P>
<P>
   PayPal is especially popular for online auction purchases but is
equally useful for other payments. My husband, for instance, used
PayPal to send $15 for a shareware program directly to the author.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, PayPal resembles an electronic wallet because it
stores personal data to enable you to buy things without revealing
private information to merchants. But unlike wallets that accompany
you online, your PayPal account information is stored on the
company's servers. To make payments, you must visit the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   PayPal's success in opening more than 2 million accounts since
it opened last year has emboldened a growing number of online
payment competitors, including PayPlace.com, payMe.com and eBay's
own Billpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is really nothing else like Paypal because it's
incredibly easy and has removed a lot of barriers to making online
payments,'' said Avivah Litan, research director for payment
systems at the Gartner Group, a research firm. ``It's easy, free
and convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for impulse bidders like me, those advantages are
also flaws. Have I mentioned that I was so inspired that I also bid
on six yards of vintage fabric for kitchen curtains ($27, via
PayPal), an egg cup (outbid, luckily), a patterned tablecloth
(ditto) and a little vase (pending)?
</P>
<P>
   To distract myself from the lure of two Kraft Kiddie Kup Swanky
Swig glasses, I phoned Vince Sollitto, an X.com spokesman, to
complain that it was PayPal's fault that I was spending so much.
</P>
<P>
   Sollitto seemed unmoved. ``That's not a bad thing in our
business,'' he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, my bad habits are at the heart of his business. The
more payments I make, the more money Paypal earns. Paypal, which
doesn't pay interest on the accounts, makes money by investing the
account balances.
</P>
<P>
   That brings me to another shortcoming: PayPal earns more
interest the longer the money is left in the accounts, so the
company would love it if buyers and sellers would make their
transactions from one PayPal account to another. But if an account
holder requests a withdrawal, it can take up to 48 hours for an
electronic bank transfer to be made and a week or for a paper check
to be received.
</P>
<P>
   Sollitto said the delays were inevitable. ``When you request a
paper check, the bulk of the delay is Uncle Sam,'' he said,
invoking the check-is-in-the-mail defense. One eBay seller I
queried via e-mail last week _ OK, I bid on his plates, which I am
happy to say went to someone else _ told me that he does not accept
PayPal payments because it takes too long to get the money out of
an account.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest drawback to PayPal is that you have no
protection if you pay a fraudulent seller. Unlike credit card
companies, who limit liability to $50, PayPal will not help you get
your money back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole goal and job is to help you make payments quickly,''
Sollitto said. ``It's the same as if you would write a check and
mail it.''
</P>
<P>
   So don't go crazy and authorize a $2,000 credit card payment,
the maximum that PayPal allows in a six-month period, to someone
you don't know. You'll limit your risk by using PayPal to make
smaller payments; 1 cent is the minimum amount.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could say that was the sale price of the three juice
glasses with oranges painted on them that I bought on eBay. But
even at $9.99, I can still afford (some) groceries.

   GERMANY: KOHL FILES MISSING
</P>
<P>
   Most of the computer files in the Chancellery of the former
leader, Helmut Kohl, were destroyed after his election defeat in
1998. Buckhard Hirsch, who has led a parliamentary inquiry into
financial wrongdoings by Kohl, told Parliament two-thirds of the
files were deleted. All files linked to the 1992 sale to France's
Elf Aquitaine of an east German oil refinery are missing, Hirsch
said. Prosecutors in Germany, France and Switzerland are
investigating the payments of tens of millions of dollars in
kickbacks on this sale.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY: DOG BREEDING BAN
</P>
<P>
   Politicians agreed on a nationwide ban on the breeding of
so-called attack dogs after public protests set off by the fatal
mauling of a 6-year-old boy in Hamburg. A statement said the ban
would apply to pit bulls, Staffordshire bull terriers and bull
terriers ``as well as other individual dog breeds and cross-breeds
deemed dangerous.'' The German railways announced an immediate ban
on allowing fighting breeds on its trains and in railway stations.

   BRITAIN: MINISTER APOLOGIZES
</P>
<P>
   After drawing widespread criticism when she was quoted as saying
Queen Elizabeth II should vacate her royal palaces, Mo Mowlam, the
Cabinet Office minister, apologized and added that the comments
were merely confirmation of something she had said six years ago.
``I apologize if I have caused any upset, but it was six years
ago,'' Mowlam told Sky Television. ``It was not anti-monarchist. It
was an attempt to ask, in the 21st century, what about a modern
palace?''
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN: PRINCELY WARNING
</P>
<P>
   Britain's media watchdog warned that Prince William, 18, has a
right to some degree of privacy even after he leaves high school
this week. ``Now he is leaving school it is certainly not a
free-for-all,'' said Lord Wakeham, chairman of the Press Complaints

   VATICAN: MOBSTER'S CONFESSION
</P>
<P>
   Vatican television said it planned a live broadcast on Saturday
of a confession by Salvatore Grigoli, a Sicilian mobster convicted
of murdering an anti-Mafia priest, Giuseppe Puglisi, in 1993. The
Justice Ministry agreed to transfer the prisoner to the Paul VI
auditorium in the Vatican for the broadcast. Grigoli, whose topic
will be ``spilling innocent blood,'' is part of a Jubilee Day
dedicated to the Union of the Blood of Christ, a Catholic
association.

   ITALY: CHAPTER CLOSES
</P>
<P>
   Italy closed a chapter of its modern history by shutting down
IRI, the Institute for Industrial Reconstruction, a state holding
company founded under Mussolini. At its peak in the 1960s, IRI
employed 600,000 people and controlled, among other assets, the
airline Alitalia, RAI, the state television company, and major
shipping lines. By 1997, IRI carried a $12 billion debt and was
given three years by the treasury to sell off its holdings and go
out of business.

   A Chinese Army officer, Lt. Col. Zhao Xinli, has been committed
to a psychiatric hospital for refusing to renounce the practice of
Falun Gong, the exercise and meditation group banned last year,
according to a Hong Kong rights group. Detentions of Falun Gong
members in a number of cities have increased in the last week, the
Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy said. Most
practitioners are briefly detained, but officials have sent more
recalcitrant members to prisons, labor camps or psychiatric
hospitals.

   A new United Nations envoy will go to Myanmar for three days of
talks with the military rulers and Aung San Suu Kyi's National
League for Democracy, an elected government still in waiting
because its victory in 1990 was never acknowledged by the junta.
The envoy, Razali Ismail of Malaysia, is a former ambassador to the
United Nations who was known for his forthright style. The junta,
which calls itself the State Peace and Development Council, has
said it hoped for more sympathy from an Asian. The former envoy was
a Peruvian.

   For the first time in its history, the Brazilian Senate has
expelled a member. The senator, Luiz Estevao, a prominent real
estate developer and member of the ruling coalition, was accused of
having siphoned off more than $100 million in government funds
intended for the construction of a federal courthouse in Sao Paulo.
With the impeachment, Estevao, who denied the charges, also loses

   Under pressure from the United States, the Security Council

now met all the requirements imposed on its government in 1996,
after the Sudanese were accused of harboring several suspects in
the attempted assassination of the Egyptian president, Hosni
Mubarak. Diplomats say all other 14 council members want sanctions
lifted.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hats off, gentlemen, to American Ballet Theater for a
heroic season. The repertory looked better on stage than on paper
and a clever Band-Aid approach kept performances at a high standard
despite an inordinate amount of illness and injury among the
dancers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the season of the unexpected. Damian Woetzel from New
York City Ballet and William Marrie from the National Ballet of
Canada parachuted in for single performances to relieve the
company's overworked male principals. Much of the burden had to do
with the technique required in the full-evening works that dominate
Ballet Theater's seasons at the Metropolitan Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   The happiest surprise in this category was John Cranko's 1969
``Taming of the Shrew,'' a comic ballet low on choreographic
interest but powerfully put across by Ballet Theater's casts in a
company premiere. The major new production was by Kevin McKenzie,
Ballet Theater's artistic director: A ``Swan Lake'' successfully
staged along more or less traditional lines.
</P>
<P>
   The only original work came from Twyla Tharp. Her one-act
``Variations on a Theme by Haydn,'' later retitled ``The
Brahms-Haydn Variations,'' needed three performances for its rich
intricacies to build to a grand climax. The premiere was part of
the opening gala celebrating the company's 60th anniversary _ which
was quickly forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this was because the good old days do not speak to the
new audience Ballet Theater has had to attract with full-evening
spectacles to fill the Met. But thanks to this season's revival of
Antony Tudor's ``Jardin aux Lilas,'' and to ``Theme and
Variations,'' created for Ballet Theater in 1947 by George
Balanchine, McKenzie maintained a link with the great 20th-century
choreographers associated with the troupe. The return of Erik
Bruhn's 1964 staging of ``La Sylphide,'' in August Bournonville's
19th-century Danish version, was another reminder of a more
eclectic past.
</P>
<P>
   What has gone more or less unnoticed is that each season at the
Met is increasingly devoted to full-evening works influenced by
Soviet ballet's aesthetics. This is neither good nor bad but a
fact, evident even in the British ballets of Kenneth MacMillan and
Cranko.
</P>
<P>
   Ballet Theater's production of MacMillan's 1965 ``Romeo and
Juliet'' derives directly from Leonid Lavrovsky's 1940 Soviet
ballet to the Prokofiev score. Cranko's duets in ``The Taming of
the Shrew'' owe much to the highly physical partnering, including
overhead lifts and tosses, that Soviet ballet made famous.
</P>
<P>
   Among the company's 19th-century Russian classics originally
choreographed by Marius Petipa (in part or entirely), ``Swan Lake''
has some antecedents in pre-Soviet versions that Nicholas Sergeyev,
a Petipa regisseur, staged in Britain. But ``La Bayadere,'' ``Le
Corsaire'' and ``Don Quixote'' have come down from Soviet
productions. The bravura solos that Vakhtang Chabukiani of the
Kirov Ballet added to ``Bayadere'' and ``Corsaire'' would have been
technically impossible in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   It is this virtuosity that has brought so much attention to the
brilliant male dancers McKenzie has recruited. But 19th-century
ballets are built around ballerinas, and they offered a showcase
for Irina Dvorovenko, who had a breakthrough season, usually in
tandem with her husband, Maxim Belotserkovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Once with the Kiev Ballet in Ukraine, both have refashioned
themselves into new kinds of dancers. He has added virtuosity to
his pure classical style. She has added refinement to her
virtuosity.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the injured or ill included Ethan Stiefel and
Giuseppe Picone (both absent all season), Susan Jaffe, Jose Manuel
Carreno, Ashley Tuttle and Belotserkovsky. Julio Bocca, Angel
Corella, Vladimir Malakhov and Joaquin De Luz had extra duty while
corps members like Marcelo Gomes, Herman Cornejo and Carlos Molina
(an admirable Petruchio to Jaffe's Katherina in ``Shrew'')
distinguished themselves in major roles.
</P>
<P>
   The question is where Ballet Theater will find new full-evening
works. MacMillan's ``Romeo'' needs a rest. Ballets like ``Shrew''
are only as good as their performance. The company's ``Don
Quixote'' looks pale compared to the version the Bolshoi Ballet has
just performed in the United States. The solutions are elsewhere.
The audience, looking for tricks and turns, may have been less
enthusiastic about ``La Sylphide'' and ``Jardin aux Lilas.'' Yet
the first is the epitome of Romantic ballet and the other is a
neo-Romantic masterpiece with a Proustian perfume. Both are
exquisite works: One should not lose them. Like carrots, they are
good for you.

<P>
   Making a movie from a cartoon short (or a ``Saturday Night
Live'' sketch) is usually a bad idea to begin with, simply because
what works for five minutes can rarely be stretched over the
duration of a feature-length film.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think that the makers of the latest dud in this genre,
``The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' would have learned this
lesson, if only because somebody else already tried to mine Jay
Ward's cartoon factory eight years ago with the big-screen bomb
``Boris and Natasha.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' takes a great many things for
granted. Chiefly:
</P>
<P>
   1. That an audience remains for the kind of good-hearted,
pun-driven hokum that fueled Ward's popular animated shorts during
their early '60s heyday, and ...
</P>
<P>
   2. That no one has seen either of the ``Austin Powers'' movies,
whose plots are essentially recycled here.
</P>
<P>
   It adds up to a misfire that tries to please everybody _ kids,
nostalgic boomers and series fanatics _ and ends up satisfying no
one. The film's self-referential, insider humor will fly over the
heads of children, while its tangle of tepid subplots will put
adults to sleep. It's just one big _ pardon the godawful pun, but
then that's the spirit of the enterprise _ ``moose-stake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' opens promisingly enough with the
faithful Narrator bringing us up to date on the happenings in
Frostbite Falls since the original series was canceled in 1964. It
seems our heroes have been more or less suspended in the 1960s
(``yeah, baby!''), as have their villainous counterparts, Fearless
Leader (Robert De Niro) and the bumbling spies Boris (Jason
Alexander) and Natasha (Rene Russo).
</P>
<P>
   The film's lively opening moments, completely animated, burst
with wit and originality and sharp fun, which dissipates at about
the mark that an old ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' cartoon would end.
Then Fearless Leader and his cohorts somehow make their way into
the real world, where Fearless plans to turn Americans into zombies
via his omnipresent cable network, RBTV (Really Bad Television).
</P>
<P>
   A plucky pixie of an FBI agent, Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo,
all lips and dimples), is assigned to find Rocky and Bullwinkle and
enlist their help. It's pretty dull sledding from here, although a
few comic bits connect, such as a ``Cops'' spoof and watching De
Niro riff on his Travis Bickle persona by way of Dr. Evil.
</P>
<P>
   But De Niro is barely in the movie. We also see very little of
Alexander and Russo and too much of Perabo, playing a character
that never should have been in the movie to begin with, much less
given the lead role. It's a sign of the movie's misplaced
loyalties, which are heightened by Kenneth Lonergan's clunky
screenplay and Des McAnuff's inept staging.
</P>
<P>
   More bad news: Lonergan is reportedly working on the screenplay
for another Ward cartoon, ``Sherman and Peabody.'' Can somebody
step into the Way-Back Machine and stop him before it's too late? &QL; 
---The film: ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' (PG; cartoon violence). &QL; 
The stars: Piper Perabo, Robert De Niro, Jason Alexander, Rene
Russo. &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Directed by Des McAnuff. Screenplay by Kenneth
Lonergan. Released by Universal Pictures. &QL; 
Running time: One hour, 26 minutes. &QL; 
Playing: Citywide. &QL;

   When June Foray greets you at her Woodland Hills home, your
first impression is that she could be somebody's sweet,
white-haired granny.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, you hear ``Hokey smokes, Bullwinkle!''
</P>
<P>
   The voice is unmistakable. Yes, beneath that granny exterior is
Rocky the Flying Squirrel, pal to the gangly, bumbling moose.
</P>
<P>
   And while Jay Ward's enduringly popular cartoon ``The Adventures
of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' went off the air in 1964, Foray, a
voice-over legend, has never stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   But now she's back as the voice of flying squirrel in the new
Universal release ``The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' which
opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The new film is a blend of live action and animation directed by
Tony Award-winner Des McAnuff (``Big River,'' ``The Who's Tommy'')
from a script by Kenneth Lonergan (``Analyze This''). It stars the
very live-action Jason Alexander as Boris Badenov, Rene Russo as
Natasha Fatale and Robert DeNiro, who also produced the film, as
Fearless Leader.
</P>
<P>
   Foray calls the original series, which ran from 1959 to 1964,
``one of the most sophisticated, mordantly witty series that's ever
been on the air. And it wasn't mean-spirited in any way.''
Nevertheless she was thrilled to reprise Rocky in a big budget
feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that, if they had called somebody else, I think the
whole world would have been disappointed,'' Foray says, with all
due modesty. ``It wouldn't be Rocky.''
</P>
<P>
   The original show's co-creator, Bill Scott, who was the voice
ofBullwinkle, died in 1985; so comedian Keith Scott (no relation)
has taken over for the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always taken aback when I work with June in a recording
studio,'' Scott says from his native Australia. ``There is always
that childlike moment _ 'Wow, I'm in the same booth with June
Foray. Pinch me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Foray and the younger Scott first performed the voices together
during a recording session in 1992, for a Universal Studios Theme
Park street show. It was the first recording of the voices since
1964.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sent shivers up and down my spine,'' says Tiffany Ward,
daughter of the series' late co-creator Jay Ward who has also
turned her dad's ``George of the Jungle'' and ``Dudley Do-Right''
properties into features.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
!tag!d &QC; 
3,5!tag!At the beginning of the movie, Rocky and Bullwinkle are in
retirement, puttering around their house and ``not even getting
residuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe, though, that June Foray has been puttering around
her Woodland Hills house all this time, waiting for ``Rocky and
Bullwinkle'' to come around again. She has never stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent Thursday, she had returned from doing the voice of
a witch, Magica De Spell, for a Disney CD-ROM, only a week after
post- production work as Granny on a new Warner Bros.
direct-to-video feature, ``Tweety's High-Flying Adventure.'' Then
there were the CD projects with Rhino Records.
</P>
<P>
   On July 7, Foray (who will only cop to being ``over 50'' though
she's been listed as 81) receives her star on the Hollywood Walk of
Fame, only the second cartoon voice performer to receive such an
honor. (The other is the late Mel Blanc. Other voice performers who
have stars, including Casey Kasem and ``Rocky'' regular Hans
Conreid, received them for other aspects of their careers.) Foray
also received a lifetime achievement award at the World Animation
Celebration earlier this month in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Her career, which has included voicing characters like Cindy-Lou
Who in the original TV cartoon version of ``How the Grinch Stole
Christmas,'' Lena Hyena in ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' and, more
recently, Grandma Fa in Disney's ``Mulan,'' even included the neat
trick of providing the voice for Mattel's Chatty Cathy doll, then
parodying that voice as an evil ``Talking Tina'' doll in an episode
of ``The Twilight Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   A longtime friend, ``Laugh-In'' announcer Gary Owens, said that
voice performers all over the city were planning to shut down work
the morning of July 7 to attend the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is so spectacular and so deserving of this star,'' Owens
said. ``People just love her.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens will be one of the speakers that day, along with Steve
Allen, legendary animator Chuck Jones and comedy icon Stan Freberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond versatility, she's just a great actor,'' says Freberg.
``People think, 'Oh, well, she does voices.' Forget voices. That's
just a tool of the actor. The basic thing that June is, is a great
actor.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
!tag!d &QC; 
3,5!tag!Much of this acclaim has taken the former live-action
actress by surprise. She had intended on a career in films, perhaps
working with her husband, the late TV and screenwriter Hobart
Donavan (``Escape to Burma''). She had even written a children's
radio series, ``Lady Makebelieve,'' as a young performer. (Those
rediscovered original scripts form the basis of her ``Tall and
Small Tales'' stories, on audio cassettes via Amazon.com and Barnes
&AMP; Noble.)
</P>
<P>
   Voices, however, are her legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems I've always been popular, but was unaware of it,''
she says. ``I get thousands of fan letters, from all over the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of the fondness that her colleagues have for Foray
comes from her willingness to help others. She has taught
voice-over acting at such venues as USC and The Learning Tree and
occasionally furnishes voices for student films and teaches
voiceover acting to inner-city kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime I can, I like to do that,'' Foray says. ``It justifies
my own success.''
</P>
<P>
   That success is the big surprise, though. It was during her
recent recording session at Disney that June Foray again
encountered the fame she never expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was almost embarrassed. There were all these young people
there, and they said that it was such a thrill and honor to meet
me. And I've been getting that lately, and it's truly humbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, if it weren't for these people, I probably wouldn't
be where I am today. I'm very grateful. I've been an extremely
fortunate human being.'' &QL;

TRUE TO HER ROOTS AND GETTING NOTICED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do the best romances start out as friendships?
</P>
<P>
   Peppy Latin teen-pop singer Angela Via not only believes so, but
she belts out the message loud and clear on her first single,
``Picture Perfect.'' The 18-year-old Via says she based the catchy
dance-pop confection, about a girl and her longtime guy pal, on her
own experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've ever had a guy friend for a long, long time, you can
really get to know him without the pressure of dating,'' Via said.
``That can be the best way to go before you get too serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Via, who has been likened to a combination of Britney Spears and
Jennifer Lopez, maintains her Latin roots, peppering her music with
hot rhythms, bilingual lyrics and Spanish guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's in my soul,'' she said. ``At the
beginning, I needed a lot of encouragement to find out who I am as
a writer and artist. And, little by little, it just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Via, whose self-titled debut album is due Sept. 26 from
Lava/Atlantic, found encouragement in an unlikely place after a
chance meeting with the great songsmith Carole King led to a
collaboration on the ballad ``Stay Together.''
</P>
<P>
   After chatting casually, Via and King decided to try writing
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carole's fantastic, and she's yet another reason why making
this album was so thrilling for me,'' Via said. ``Plus, she was
doing some dog-sitting when we were working together at her house,
and that made the work all the more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in San Antonio, Texas, and raised in Portland, Ore., Via
started singing at age 8, influenced by Gloria Estefan, Selena and
the traditional Latin music her grandmother would play during
family visits. In late 1996, Via ventured into a studio for the
first time, cutting some of her favorite Selena songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to see what it would be like to do some
recording,'' she said. ``Dad knows his way around a studio, and we
just thought it would be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Via soon made her first public appearance as part of a Martin
Luther King Jr. Day celebration in Portland for a crowd of some
3,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting on stage that day was so special,'' she recalls. ``It
broke down some of the fears I'd built up about singing in front of
a large audience, and it showed me just how powerful music can be.
The reaction was great, and I couldn't wait to do it all over
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Via performs Sunday at the All That Music &AMP; More Festival 2000
with LFO, BWitched, Sammie, Bosson and Take 5 at Verizon Wireless
Amphitheatre in Irvine. The show, a sort of Lollapalooza for
preteens, is hosted by Kenan Thompson and Nick Cannon of
Nickelodeon's ``All That.''
</P>
<P>
   Released three months ago, Via's ``Picture Perfect'' reached No.
28 on the singles chart, leading to a spot on TV's ``Rosie
O'Donnell Show.'' Another song, ``Catch Me If You Can,'' was used
on the million-selling soundtrack to ``Pokemon: The First Movie.''
And as if that weren't enough marketing to the Radio Disney crowd,
Via's image will be seen this fall on the back of 15 million boxes
of Cocoa Pebbles cereal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I love most is coming up with the song,'' Via said.
``But, more recently, what's really been great is hearing the way
people react when they hear the music. I mean, if people find that
they can relate to these songs or are just having fun with the
album, that's the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Via in the studio was a top-flight crew of hitmakers,
including the team behind the Jennifer Paige smash, ``Crush,'' and
the writers- producers of Christina Aguilera's chart-topping
``Genie in a Bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   For Via, who wrote most of the album's lyrics, the songs trace
the emotional highs, lows and eventual end of a romance _ from
``Picture Perfect'' and its story of two friends falling in love to
``Kissing You,''which tells of love in full bloom, to the romantic
crisis detailed in ``Wish We Could Be Free'' and the hopeful
longing of ``Start Over Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Via avoids dwelling on the heartbreak she relates in ``Wish We
Could Be Free,'' though, and laughs when asked about what it meant
to turn 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say to my parents, `You know what, mom and dad, I don't
have to ``wish I could be free'', because I'm 18,''' she said.
``Can you imagine? They would LOVE to hear that.'' &QL;

FOR COLORADO FESTIVALS,   MILE-HIGH CHALLENGES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Colo., Mass., Calif., Wash., Ohio, Spain, Britain,
Canada)  (For release Sunday, July 2)  
 By DANIEL GESMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ Far from the Eastern shores of the American
Dance Festival and Jacob's Pillow, summer dance gatherings in
Colorado illustrate the surprising cultural vitality of the Rocky
Mountain state as well as tensions, both financial and
paradigmatic, affecting arts presenters nationwide. Three festivals
in Boulder and one each in Aspen and Vail run the gamut of
programming styles and means.
</P>
<P>
   Blazing a trail along a risky frontier is Boulder's Colorado
Dance Festival, one of America's few dance-only presenters and
widely considered one of its top three dance festivals. Despite
drawing 400 students and 5,000 spectators, last season ended with
significant debts and an inadequate operating budget.
</P>
<P>
   A chronic shortage of suitable dance spaces pushed 1999
performances into the expensive Boulder Theater, where attendance
was undermined by high ticket prices and increased competition from
the city's Shakespeare Festival, Music Festival and Chautauqua
series and statewide events like the Telluride Bluegrass Festival.
As problems that afflicted the festival, Dr. Michelle Heffner
Hayes, Colorado Dance Festival's 1997-99 director and now head of
Cultural Affairs for Miami-Dade Community College, also cited a
shrinking federal arts budget, declining corporate and individual
donations, cyclical shifts in private foundations' financing
policies and the lack of a permanent endowment.
</P>
<P>
   Dance Umbrella, for nearly 20 years Boston's leading showcase
for diverse contemporary performers, underwent a similar crisis
last January that its director-producer, Jeremy Alliger, referred
to as ``a wake-up call'' for those who give and raise money. The
organization is now advancing behind a rally of corporate and
municipal support and major grants from the Doris Duke Charitable
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Dance Festival nearly went on hiatus this summer to
focus on restructuring before grants arrived from the Lila Wallace
Reader's Digest Fund, the National Endowment for the Arts and state
and local organizations. The Glenwood Springs Dance Festival,
active since 1992, was less fortunate. It folded following the 1998
season, a year after the 29-year-old DanceAspen shut down.
</P>
<P>
   A global sweep distinguishes the Colorado Dance Festival, which
Marda Kirn founded in 1982 and Heffner Hayes compared to the
Sundance Film Festival. While providing a showcase for
international stars and emerging artists, the festival has also
given rare emphasis to non-Western dance, reflecting Boulder's
interest in diverse artistic and spiritual traditions. The 1996-99
``Let's Dance Together! The Americas'' series concentrated
primarily on popular African Diaspora forms of North, Central and
South America and their underappreciated connections with
contemporary Western concert dance.
</P>
<P>
   Boulder's support for multicultural art and dance in general,
whether home-grown or imported, has been eroding amid rapid growth,
spiraling rents and real estate prices, and an accelerating influx
of affluent young white residents who favor outdoor recreation and
mainstream entertainment. Space for Dance, a part of the nonprofit
Boulder Dance Alliance, was a recent casualty. It provided support
and affordable space to Boulder County dance groups, which
multiplied from three in 1990 to at least 25 today. After shuffling
among temporary locations for several years, last summer Space for
Dance could not find an affordable, properly zoned home.
Negotiations also failed to land it civic-use space alongside other
cultural service groups within a downtown development project.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Colorado Dance Festival will distribute city
money originally budgeted for Space for Dance in a dance-space
subsidy program. Moreover, its world-beat programming is on the
rebound under the curatorship of Kirn and the direction of
Katherine MacDiarmid, previously head of Florida's Mount Dora
Center for the Arts, whose annual arts festival grew into one of
the nation's best in two years under her administration.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Dance Festival, running from Thursday through July 23
on the University of Colorado campus, highlights emerging groups
that integrate culturally specific traditions into a modern dance
framework: Robert Moses' Kin, Rosanna Gamson/World Wide and
Compagnie Nakissa. A faculty from the five continents will offer
some 400 students a stunning array of classes, including West
African, Afro-Cuban, Sufi, Persian, Kurdish, Middle Eastern folk,
Bharata Natyam, Capoeira, Hip-Hop, Flamenco, Latin- and
Euro-American-based modern and postmodern.
</P>
<P>
   Not every Colorado State dance festival organizer accepts a
multicultural mandate to the same degree. Local standards and
tastes should be the primary guide, according to Jean-Philippe
Malaty, who, with the former Joffrey Ballet principal dancer Tom
Mossbrucker, directs the four-year-old Aspen Ballet Company and the
Aspen Dance Festival. Running from July 12 through Aug. 5 at the
Aspen District Theater, Aspen Dance Festival emerged in the
aftermath of DanceAspen, which the City of Aspen presented once in
1998 after the founding organization went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom and I have very eclectic tastes, and we want to present
things that we ourselves enjoy,'' said Malaty. ``But you can't
dictate what you think people should see. You have to be in touch
with your community and appeal to all sides of it with
high-quality, well-marketed programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Malaty's and Mossbrucker's formula for broad appeal includes
something classical, something modern, something ethnic and
something up-and-coming. The programs include the Joffrey Ballet of
Chicago, La Tania Flamenco Music and Dance, and the Aspen Ballet
Company in David Taylor's ``Children's Rainforest Odyssey,'' as
well as a mixed repertory featuring San Francisco Ballet guests and
a world premiere by Nicolo Fonte. The Paul Taylor Dance Company
closes the festival.
</P>
<P>
   Most dance festivals, Colorado Dance included, must pay for a
year-round office for main seasons that last only a few weeks. In
addition to marketing savvy, Aspen Dance Festival enjoys the
administration of the Aspen Ballet Company, which in September will
merge with Santa Fe Festival Ballet to become the Aspen Santa Fe
Ballet. While Malaty and Mossbrucker like taking creative risks
with their dance group, they are satisfied with tried-and-true
festival programming. Furthermore, anything that the festival might
lose on misfires, the Aspen Ballet Company can recoup with a
wintertime ``Nutcracker.''
</P>
<P>
   But raising money has its challenges even in Aspen, said Malaty.
Its wealthy residents, who typically make primary donations in
first homes elsewhere, don't always give generously to Aspen's
165-odd competing nonprofit groups Aspen Dance Festival keeps its
lowest tickets at $18 for the 50 percent of its audience that
consists of full-time residents.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old Vail International Dance Festival, in similar
environs, seems most securely financed. Its parent organization,
the nonprofit Vail Valley Foundation, produces major international
sports events and the annual American Enterprise Institute World
Forum, headed by former President Gerald R. Ford, who lives in
nearby Beaver Creek. Ford and his wife, Betty, a former dancer with
and board member of the now-distressed Martha Graham Dance Company,
are honorary directors of the Vail festival, which also benefits
from the largesse of private donors like the philanthropist and
arts patron Judy Alexander and the investment banker, lawyer and
real estate developer Gilbert Giordano and his wife, Donna.
</P>
<P>
   Under its producing artistic director, Katherine C. Kersten, a
former dancer and teacher, the Vail festival emphasizes world-class
ballet but also presents culturally specific genres that are
familiar and accessible to resort habitues, like Irish step and
Slavic folk, seen last summer. It also offers free lectures by
festival artists, a conference for ballet teachers and intensive
ballet training for 80 students and pre-professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The Vail festival performances, which run from July 20 through
Aug. 12, include the Spanish classical company Ballet Victor Ullate
de Madrid; the Spanish Gypsy flamenco artist Manolete and La Rosa
Flamenco Theater; the Washington Ballet, dancing choreography by
the San Francisco Ballet artist Val Caniparoli; and the Paul
Mitchell International Evenings of Dance, which feature principal
couples from Pilobolus, the National Ballet of China, American
Ballet Theater, the Boston Ballet, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet,
London's Royal Ballet and the Cleveland-San Jose Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Two smaller gatherings suggest that, on one scale or another,
Colorado festivals as daring as the Colorado Dance Festival can
thrive without the security and glamour of an upscale resort
setting. The Boulder Jazz Dance Workshop, attracting nearly 150
professional and amateur dancers from around the world for 14 days
of intensive study with master teachers, celebrates its 22nd year
from July 30 through Aug. 12 on the University of Colorado campus
with a comprehensive jazz-based curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   From July 23 through 30, the Boulder campus will be host to the
second annual Aerial Dance Festival, created by the 11-year-old
Boulder company, Frequent Flyers Productions. A workshop for 80-odd
dancers features daily classes that include low-flying trapeze,
upside-down movement, bungee and aerial hoop, fabric, pole and
choreography.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Jazz Dance Workshop, the Aerial Dance Festival is
financed largely by student tuition and ticket sales. But if the
past is any indication, cozy and inventive gatherings like these
can give birth to larger-scale developments in dance performance,
programming and public support.

 &HT;    ELIAN, FAMILY RETURN TO CUBA FOLLOWING MONTHS-LONG AMERICAN
ODYSSEY
 &HT;    ATTN EDs: The story will be updated upon Elian's arrival in
Havana, expected around 8:15 p.m. ET.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Nearly seven months to the day after he was plucked from
the sea, 6-year-old rafter Elian Gonzalez jetted home toward Cuba
with his family Wednesday, ending a remarkable saga that tugged at
heartstrings and stirred intense political debate the world over.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear a legal
appeal by his Miami relatives who wanted to keep him in the United
States, Elian and his immediate family climbed aboard a small
chartered jet at Dulles International Airport outside Washington,
D.C. for their flight to Havana. The plane took off at about 4:42
p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy to be going home,'' Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, told reporters in broken English shortly before boarding
the jet with his second wife, infant son and Elian. ``I'd like to
thank the North American government for finally giving me my son
back after all my family's suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government _ which discouraged many U.S. journalists
from traveling to Havana to cover the homecoming _ insisted there
would be no large public celebrations, although a small welcoming
ceremony was planned at Jose Marti International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports that the family would stay for several weeks
at a secluded diplomatic compound in the Havana suburb of Miramar.
Later in the summer, they will take a vacation and then return
their home in Cardenas, about a two hours from Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives made no public appearances Wednesday,
and angrily confronted a Miami television reporter who filmed them
outside a Coconut Grove Church shortly after the Supreme Court
decision was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are devastated that at this very moment, Elian is going
back to a country where he'll never be free,'' family spokesman
Armando Gutierrez said. ``This is a very rough time for us, but we
must obey the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian leaves behind a tangled legacy of warring lawyers, feuding
family members and hard feelings among Cuban exiles here, who
adopted his case as a symbol of their bitter hatred for Castro's
communist dictatorship. As Elian boarded the jet in Washington, a
few dozen somber Cuban exiles gathered outside the Little Havana
home where the boy lived for five months with his Miami relatives.
Many had tears streaming down their faces, while others held up
their hands in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came for the boy at gunpoint, that's the scary part,''
said Ruth Dupree, 27, a second-generation Cuban-American. ``This
family that did so much for him never got to say good-bye. It's
shaken my faith in America.''
</P>
<P>
   At a press briefing in Washington, President Clinton said he
regretted that the case became so politically charged, although he
said it would have been fine if Elian and his father had decided to
stay in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno _ who became a lightning rod of
criticism for her handling of the case _ applauded the Supreme
Court's decision not to hear the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``All involved have had an opportunity to make their case _ all
the way to the highest court in the land,'' Reno said. ``I hope
that everyone will accept the Supreme Court's decision and join me
in wishing this family, and this special little boy, well.''
</P>
<P>
   With his impish grin and photogenic face, Elian captured the
hearts of millions, especially after they heard the harrowing story
of how his mother and 10 others drowned while trying to escape from
Cuba. Elian was found alone, floating in an inner-tube a few miles
offshore the Florida coast on Thanksgiving Day last year.
</P>
<P>
   With the initial blessing of his father and the U.S. government,
Elian was taken in by his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, a Little
Havana mechanic who left Cuba more than 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the family's early relief that Elian had survived quickly
dissolved into acrimony over where the boy should live.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials took until early January to rule that Elian
should be returned to his father in Cuba, a decision that sparked a
day of angry protests in Miami. The Miami family quickly filed a
federal lawsuit aimed at winning Elian an asylum hearing and the
right to remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In late January, the boy's two Cuban grandmothers traveled to
the United States _ and briefly to Miami to see the boy _ in an
unsuccessful bid to take Elian home. Their visit only seemed to
feed the rancorous debate over the boy's future.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, Castro turned Elian into a cause celebre, staging
massive public rallies and marches that attracted hundreds of
thousands who chanted and sang for his return.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a Miami federal judge ruled that Elian should go home
with his father, triggering the Miami family's immediate appeal to
the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the dramatic arrival of Juan Miguel Gonzalez from Cuba
in early April, sparking a new round of demands _ and a wave of
support from the American public _ that the boy be turned over to
his father pending the court appeal. After several weeks of
frustrating negotiations, Reno ordered a pre-dawn raid on April 22
to forcibly take the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The raid triggered outrage and a day of angry protests in Miami,
along with uneasiness among many Americans shocked by a news photo
of a terrified Elian being snatched by a gun-wielding agent.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling soon subsided, however, after Elian was reunited
with his father in the Washington area and subsequent photos of the
smiling boy were released. He spent the next two months living
mostly in seclusion, awaiting the outcome of the court case.
</P>
<P>
   On June 1, the Atlanta appeals court ruled against the Miami
relatives; then reaffirmed its decision on June 23.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-ditch effort, the Miami relatives asked the Supreme
Court to hear the case, but were rebuffed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the case that captured the attention of U.S. presidential
candidates and is cited as a factor in an apparent deal in Congress
to ease the embargo against Cuba is finally over.
</P>
<P>
   But it will clearly never be forgotten in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible,'' said Ana Vega, 27, a Cuban-American
schoolteacher. ``It's just publicity for Castro. In his eyes, he
beat the American government. They gave in to that evil, horrible
man.''

 &HT;    ELIAN, FAMILY RETURN TO CUBA FOLLOWING MONTHS-LONG AMERICAN
ODYSSEY
 &HT;    ATTN EDs: The story will be updated upon Elian's arrival in
Havana, expected around 8:15 p.m. ET.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Nearly seven months to the day after he was plucked from
the sea, 6-year-old rafter Elian Gonzalez jetted home toward Cuba
with his family Wednesday, ending a remarkable saga that tugged at
heartstrings and stirred intense political debate the world over.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear a legal
appeal by his Miami relatives who wanted to keep him in the United
States, Elian and his immediate family climbed aboard a small
chartered jet at Dulles International Airport outside Washington,
D.C. for their flight to Havana. The plane took off at about 4:42
p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy to be going home,'' Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, told reporters in broken English shortly before boarding
the jet with his second wife, infant son and Elian. ``I'd like to
thank the North American government for finally giving me my son
back after all my family's suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government _ which discouraged many U.S. journalists
from traveling to Havana to cover the homecoming _ insisted there
would be no large public celebrations, although a small welcoming
ceremony was planned at Jose Marti International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports that the family would stay for several weeks
at a secluded diplomatic compound in the Havana suburb of Miramar.
Later in the summer, they will take a vacation and then return
their home in Cardenas, about a two hours from Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives made no public appearances Wednesday,
and angrily confronted a Miami television reporter who filmed them
outside a Coconut Grove Church shortly after the Supreme Court
decision was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are devastated that at this very moment, Elian is going
back to a country where he'll never be free,'' family spokesman
Armando Gutierrez said. ``This is a very rough time for us, but we
must obey the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian leaves behind a tangled legacy of warring lawyers, feuding
family members and hard feelings among Cuban exiles here, who
adopted his case as a symbol of their bitter hatred for Castro's
communist dictatorship. As Elian boarded the jet in Washington, a
few dozen somber Cuban exiles gathered outside the Little Havana
home where the boy lived for five months with his Miami relatives.
Many had tears streaming down their faces, while others held up
their hands in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came for the boy at gunpoint, that's the scary part,''
said Ruth Dupree, 27, a second-generation Cuban-American. ``This
family that did so much for him never got to say good-bye. It's
shaken my faith in America.''
</P>
<P>
   At a press briefing in Washington, President Clinton said he
regretted that the case became so politically charged, although he
said it would have been fine if Elian and his father had decided to
stay in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno _ who became a lightning rod of
criticism for her handling of the case _ applauded the Supreme
Court's decision not to hear the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``All involved have had an opportunity to make their case _ all
the way to the highest court in the land,'' Reno said. ``I hope
that everyone will accept the Supreme Court's decision and join me
in wishing this family, and this special little boy, well.''
</P>
<P>
   With his impish grin and photogenic face, Elian captured the
hearts of millions, especially after they heard the harrowing story
of how his mother and 10 others drowned while trying to escape from
Cuba. Elian was found alone, floating in an inner-tube a few miles
offshore the Florida coast on Thanksgiving Day last year.
</P>
<P>
   With the initial blessing of his father and the U.S. government,
Elian was taken in by his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, a Little
Havana mechanic who left Cuba more than 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the family's early relief that Elian had survived quickly
dissolved into acrimony over where the boy should live.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials took until early January to rule that Elian
should be returned to his father in Cuba, a decision that sparked a
day of angry protests in Miami. The Miami family quickly filed a
federal lawsuit aimed at winning Elian an asylum hearing and the
right to remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In late January, the boy's two Cuban grandmothers traveled to
the United States _ and briefly to Miami to see the boy _ in an
unsuccessful bid to take Elian home. Their visit only seemed to
feed the rancorous debate over the boy's future.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, Castro turned Elian into a cause celebre, staging
massive public rallies and marches that attracted hundreds of
thousands who chanted and sang for his return.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a Miami federal judge ruled that Elian should go home
with his father, triggering the Miami family's immediate appeal to
the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the dramatic arrival of Juan Miguel Gonzalez from Cuba

his father pending the court appeal. After several weeks of

KREMLIN PRESENTS PLANS FOR WESTERN-STYLE ECONOMIC OVERHAUL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ On a day largely devoted to displaying its political
and fiscal mastery, the Kremlin issued its long-awaited plan to
overhaul Russia's creaking economy Wednesday. True to predictions,
it was the very model of modern Western economic theory.
</P>
<P>
   It was also considerably bolder than almost any plans that most
Western nations have ever tried to push past suspicious voters and
hardened special interests. But given the overwhelming popularity
President Vladimir Putin is enjoying these days, outside experts
say that for the moment, anyway, it actually has a chance to become
law.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps by design, the unveiling of the fiscal plan almost
overshadowed the day's other major event: a solid vote by Russia's
upper house of parliament against Putin's plan to effectively
disband it, fire its members and replace them with senators elected
by secret ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The upper house, the Federation Council, voted 129-13 against
the proposal, averting what one newspaper called Putin's proposal
for ritual suicide. But many experts said the council may only have
stayed the execution. Russia's lower house, which is solidly in
Putin's hand and which overwhelmingly passed the measure earlier
this month, seemed ready to override the vote and make the proposal
law.
</P>
<P>
   With the new economic blueprint that it announced Wednesday, the
Kremlin aims to slash the subsidies that have kept utility rates
here outrageously low and wipe out the unpaid wages, tax breaks and
other obligations that have sapped the government's already limited
spending power. It also will devise an entirely new energy policy
for the world's largest and almost coldest nation.
</P>
<P>
   And those are but the major goals for this year. The rest of the
plan proposes radical changes in everything from the nation's
moribund banking system to its pension funds, now carved up among a
bevy of government fiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners were approving. ``It's a strong, liberal reform
program,'' said Al Breach, an economist with Goldman Sachs in
Moscow. ``These are the same reforms that have been bandied around
in I.M.F. and World Bank programs for years, but this time it's the
Russians themselves doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The program was debated for months in the government and in a
government research group led by the new minister of trade and
economy, German Gref, which drew up the plan.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing Wednesday, the deputy prime minister, Mikhail M.
Kasyanov, asserted that the government could ensure economic growth
of 5 percent a year and strengthen the ruble by half should the
proposals become law.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   History suggests that the changes may not be so simple to carry
out. Countless reform programs under former President Boris Yeltsin
were forgotten as soon as they were published, often perishing
beneath the opposition of the communist-dominated lower house, the
Duma.
</P>
<P>
   But the Duma, as well as the public, is now firmly behind Putin.
And with the economy buoyed by profits from soaring oil prices, it
may be easier to push otherwise painful reforms through the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The government's program calls for raising energy prices, which
still lag far behind the cost of production, and for greater fiscal
openness in the operations of Russia's natural gas monopoly,
Gazprom. A private savings system for pensions could be instituted
as early as next year, while action on bank reform, which Kasyanov
called a crucial goal, was put off until the fall.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The lower house has already passed changes to the tax code
largely drafted by the Kremlin, and the government is drawing up
plans to discipline the regions' finances. The proposed tax changes
would reduce the burden on companies by 20 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Before the lower house delves deeply into Putin's economic
proposals, it is expected to complete his restructuring of the
upper house, and that could come as soon as Friday, the Duma's
deputy speaker said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's backers in the Duma said flatly that they had the 300
votes needed to override the upper house's vote Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If Putin's supporters succeed, they will have ratified the most
sweeping change in the government since Yeltsin put down a
communist coup and drew up a new constitution in 1993. The
council's current 178 members, all appointees, consist of the
all-powerful governors of Russia's 89 regions and the 89 leaders of
their regional legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Putin would replace them with the governors' and legislators'
nominees, who would have to survive a secret ballot by local
legislators to win their four-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is part of Putin's pledge to restore central
control in Russia. He has already carved the nation into seven
super-regions and put his personal appointee in charge of federal
money, patronage and law enforcement in each.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Putin's aides took the Federal Council's veto calmly. ``This
move was predictable,'' the Interfax news service quoted a Kremlin
official as saying. ``There is no cause for worry.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Federation Council accused Putin of trying to
subvert Russia's constitution and pull off a coup.
</P>
<P>
   In debate before Wednesday's vote, they proposed a
constitutional convention of sorts at which the final structure of
Russia's democracy would be drafted. But Boris Gryzlov, the head of
the Unity faction that essentially represents Putin in the Duma,
said the legislators were no longer interested in the upper
chamber's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not see any need in initiating conciliatory procedures,''
he said. ``All this is a thing of the past.''

ISRAEL AND PALESTINIANS SEEM FAR FROM MEETING U.S. TERMS FOR SUMMIT

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israelis and Palestinians on Wednesday appeared
to remain far from meeting the conditions set down by the Clinton
administration for an early summit meeting in Washington. But
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who came here to assess the
two sides' readiness, said that President Clinton would make a
decision in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and her aides left open the possibility that Clinton
might decide that now was the time to seize the moment and go an
for immediate summit meeting. Palestinian officials, however,
suggested that they would prefer more negotiations over the next
two weeks so they could improve their positions for a meeting a bit
later.
</P>
<P>
   Albright on Wednesday refused to concede that an immediate
summit meeting was unlikely, even though she has said in the past
that it would not be fruitful to call one unless the two sides had
significantly narrowed their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking at a news conference at the White House on
Wednesday, said that nothing had been scheduled. But he added that
he did not think the final, most difficult issues could be resolved
unless the Israeli and Palestinian leaders ``get together in some
isolated setting and make the last tough decisions, or decide not
to make them, as the case may be.''
</P>
<P>
   A top aide to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Nabil Shaath,
who took part in Wednesday's talks between Arafat and Albright in
Ramallah, ruled out the possibility of a summit meeting in the next
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He said that major differences persisted on the key issues of
Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank, the status of Jerusalem and
the fate of Palestinian refugees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to see a summit held in the White House presided
over by President Clinton to be successful,'' Shaath said,
indicating that it was still too soon. ``You can't bridge oceans,
it's much easier to bridge rivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel has been eager for a summit
meeting, even as early as next week, in part because his
parliamentary coalition has been roiled by contention over the
terms of a peace with the Palestinians. Barak has calculated,
Israeli analysts say, that the sooner he can get a peace agreement,
one that he insists will ``strengthen'' Israel, the better it will
be for his political survival.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a sharp reversal from when he came to power 18 months ago,
Barak is now anxious for U.S. involvement to prod the peace effort
along.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, who has already invested considerable time coaxing
Barak and Arafat toward the finish line, time is running out. But
Albright declined to rule out a summit meeting during the
Democratic and Republican conventions in late July and August.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday with Albright, Barak said that
calling a summit was the prerogative of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is up to the president to make up his mind,'' Barak said.
``We will be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Until now we have no agreement. The substantial
negotiation will begin only if and when there will be a summit
meeting and we will negotiate only an agreement that will
strengthen Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright, on a second visit here in a month to set the stage for
a summit that Clinton hopes will be a crowning achievement of his
presidency, arrived as the administration's senior Middle East
envoy, Dennis Ross, completed a week of intense negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   There was serious activity on all fronts in the last week,
including a briefing by Ross of Barak's shaky coalition partners in
an effort to assuage them about the details of the negotiations.
There was also an unusually long, five-hour session last Sunday
between Arafat and Barak's chief negotiator, Shlomo Ben-Ami.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Israel's justice minister, Yossi Beilin, flew to
Cairo to brief President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, who is seen as an
important link to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, the Israeli press has been deluged with
leaks in the Israeli press about the possible contours of a peace
agreement. These have included the notion of the Palestinians
receiving more than 90 percent of the West Bank, considerably more
than previously contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the key elements of the territorial issue, according
to knowledgeable officials, is that Arafat is demanding that if the
Palestinians do not receive 100 percent of the West Bank, they must
be compensated with Israeli land elsewhere, possibly in the Negev
near the Gaza strip. This sort of ``land swap'' has not been
discussed much in public and according to officials will be a
crucial ingredient of a summit.
</P>
<P>
   A common interpretation of the events of the past week was that
Arafat, emboldened by what he perceives as Barak's political need
for a quick summit, was holding out for as much as possible before
sitting down at the table.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian leader has been insisting that Barak must agree
to go ahead with the third further redeployment of the Israeli
military on the West Bank before a summit meeting is held. A new
delay until July 7 has been set for that.
</P>
<P>
   According to the second round of Oslo accords and its
amendments, the redeployment would leave Israel in control of only
Jerusalem, settlements and specified military zones. Barak, fearful
that such a concession could trigger the collapse of his
government, wants the redeployment folded into the final round of
talks.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official who has been here in the past
week said the Palestinians feel ``entitled'' to the further
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not something that I think they are going to change
their attitude on, but they also are prepared to accept the
president's decision on the timing of the summit,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever Clinton's decision on the timing of a summit,
Arafat and Barak had agreed to comply, the official said. ``If he
says: `Now is the time,' okay. If he says `I want to do something
else before proceeding to that,' okay,'' the official said.

 &HT;    Georgia lures golf coach from NCAA champion Arizona
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Athens, Ga. _ When Arizona women's golf coach Todd McCorkle
contacted Georgia assistant athletics director Craig White nearly
two weeks ago, he was calling to recommend a friend for UGA's
vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, McCorkle became only the third coach in the 34-year
history of the Georgia women's golf program. McCorkle, 37, leaves
an Arizona team that this year produced one of the most successful
seasons in history, winning the NCAA title along with nine
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle replaces Beans Kelly, who retired last month after 15
seasons . Kelly led the Lady Dogs to seven Southeastern Conference
titles and was chosen 1998 coach of the year by Golfweek magazine
and the National Golf Coaches Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I contacted Georgia to recommend someone and they asked if I
was interested. Originally, I was fighting that because of the team
I had coming back to Arizona. But I came here for the interview and
saw how special this place and the people are. It really turned my
head,'' McCorkle said.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle, a 1986 graduate of UNC-Charlotte, played on the Ben
Hogan Tour in 1991-92. He began coaching in 1993 at Florida, where
he served as assistant men's coach from 1993-96 and also interim
women's head coach in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996-97, McCorkle was the men's and women's coach at Coastal
Carolina, before leaving for Arizona. He spent his first season at
Arizona as associate coach for both the men's and women's teams,
and then was named women's head coach in 1998. The Lady Wildcats
finished third and fourth at the 1998 and '99 NCAA Championships.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle said he was attracted to Georgia because of the
school's Boyd Golf Center, which includes a $1.2 million practice
facility and a $600,000 clubhouse completed last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the thing that impressed me the most. It just
shows the commitment Georgia has to golf,'' McCorkle said.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle inherits three players from a team that finished
seventh in this year's NCAAs. The Lady Dogs should also have back
sophomores Reilley Rankin and Summer Sirmons, who missed last
season because of injuries. Rankin was the 1998 SEC player of the
year and national freshman of the year.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle said he hopes to retain Georgia assistant coach Kelly
Hester, who also was a candidate to replace Kelly.

WILL OSCARS GET ANIMATED

(Eds: Goes with June Foray story) 
By RODNEY RICHEY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While she still loves doing voices for animation, one of June
Foray's most passionate drives these days is regarding animation.
</P>
<P>
   As a longtime member of the Board of Governors for the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, she is advocating a new
category for the Academy Awards: Best Animated Motion Picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although animated films do qualify for the Best Picture
category, it is very unlikely that one could win against, say,
`American Beauty,' '' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Foray adds that such a category, if approved, would be an
occasional one, brought out only when a sufficient number of strong
animated features had been released.
</P>
<P>
   That is a sticking point with the board, says John Pavlik,
director of communications for the academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have 10 animated feature films in a year, but none of
them is any good, and yet the number 10 triggers an automatic
nomination for two or three of them, that doesn't seem quite
fair,'' Pavlik says.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, if you go much beyond that, you're sort of
making a nomination impossible (given the number of animated films
released).''
</P>
<P>
   That the academy would be recognizing feature animation,
however, might spur increased production, Pavlik adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the goals in coming up with the Academy Awards
in the first place: trying to get producers to really think about
coming up with a quality product.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sticking point is a complex one: What constitutes an
``animated'' feature? Foray's ``The Adventures of Rocky and
Bullwinkle'' contains both animation and live action.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a question that the board will have to address,''
Pavlik says. ``How much (animation) has to be in a film before we
call it an 'animated' film?''
</P>
<P>
   The absolute earliest such an award could be instituted would be
for the awards given out in 2002. The last new category added was
Best Makeup in 1964 (as an occasional award). The periodic award
for Best Visual Effects, established in 1936, was made an annual
award in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And the academy, Pavlik says, does not like to add categories
and dilute the value of the Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think it would be a popular award,'' Pavlik says
of the proposal. ``The audience would enjoy it, and I think the
industry would enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a revered veteran of animation, from its Golden Age to the
present, Foray feels a sense of duty in pushing this cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are an art form,'' she says. ``It used to be that Disney
was the only one making these, because ... Disney was the only one
with the wherewithal and the money. But there's been such an
explosion of interest in animation from DreamWorks, 20th Century
Fox, Warner Bros., and even foreign films,'' Foray says, citing
Japan's recent ``Princess Mononoke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People love animated films, and they do make money. At least
there would be a category for them, and they would have the
opportunity of winning.'' &QL;

&HT;     CLINTON ENDORSES FOOD AND MEDICAL SALES TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Wednesday said he will likely
sign legislation allowing food and medical sales to Cuba because it
would help the Cuban people but not help the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   He also said a further thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations would await
steps by the Cuban government ``to reach out to us as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not specify what steps Cuban leader Fidel Castro
would have to take before better relations could be achieved
between the Communist island nation and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But he did say Castro has to do more to make amends for the 1996
incident in which Cuban fighter planes killed four anti-Castro
Cuban-Americans by shooting down two planes they were in. Cuba
claimed the planes were in Cuban air space, a charge the victims'
relatives and the Clinton administration denied.
</P>
<P>
   Under legislation sponsored by Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash.,
and agreed to Tuesday by House Republican leaders, the 40-year-old
U.S. trade embargo would be eased to allow sales of U.S. food,
medicine and medical products to Cuba, Sudan, Iran, Afghanistan and
Libya. However, Cuba could not buy other U.S. products and Cuba
could not sell its cigars, rum, sugar or other goods in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that while he favored selling food and medicine to
Cuba, he had questions about whether the Nethercutt proposal would
impede travel to Cuba. The president supports more travel between
the United States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he prefers language in the already-passed Senate
version that would allow full sanctions to be reimposed, if needed,
to punish Cuba for bad behavior.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would sign the Nethercutt legislation if these
questions can be answered, and he is convinced it ``will be a net
plus in terms of our strategy, which is to reach out to the Cuban
people without supporting the Cuban government.''
</P>
<P>
   Normal relations with Cuba cannot be achieved ``until there is a
bipartisan majority (that) believes that there has been some effort
on the part of the Cuban government to reach out to us as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking at a news conference, praised Vice President
Al Gore, saying: ``No person in the history of the republic has
ever had the positive impact on this country as vice president that
Al Gore has had. That is a historical fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said Gore's economic proposals are the best ones
for maintaining prosperity and that he better understands complex
technological problems facing the nation in the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if (voters) know those three things about Al Gore,
it's still more likely than not that he will win,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   And he predicted Gore would defeat Texas Gov. George W. Bush
this fall, even though Bush is leading Gore by five points or more
in most polls. Gore has been dogged by reports of conflict within
the Justice Department over appointing a special prosecutor to
investigate Gore's involvement in possibly illegal campaign
fundraising in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno rejected the latest call from
Justice Department task force chief Robert Conrad for an
independent probe of Gore, and on Tuesday told Congress she had
received no White House pressure to block the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has ``made a very compelling case'' in dealing with
campaign finance questions, ``and certainly demonstrated that a lot
of the accusations against him ... are not so,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately ``the best thing to do is for the American people
to make their own judgments about it,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   On Gore, Clinton said voters were ``still trying to figure out
what they think about this race.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to navigate his way through what he termed a ``dead-bang
loser'' question on whether Bush is intelligent enough to run the
nation, Clinton said a president must combine intelligence with
curiosity, broad experience and ability to sort out the important
from the not-so-important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for a president not to try to micromanage
the presidency,'' he said. ``It's a `deciding' job.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his plans after leaving the White House, Clinton
joked: ``Maybe I'll run for the school board someday. That's about
the only thing I can imagine doing. I don't have any other plans. I
just want to be a good citizen.''

</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments on Cuba came just hours before a jet took
six-year-old Elian Gonzalez and his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
home to Cuba after a seven-month battle with the Gonzalez family's
Miami relatives over whether the boy would stay in the United
States or return to Cuba. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to act on
the Miami family's final petition to obtain asylum for the boy,
clearing the way for the departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he and his father decided they wanted to stay here, it
would be fine with me,'' Clinton said. ``Do I wish it had unfolded
in a less dramatic, less traumatic way for all concerned? Of
course, I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also warned the oil industry that ``we're running a
serious investigation'' into soaring gasoline prices. He noted pump
prices have dropped by about 8 cents a gallon in the Midwest since
the Federal Trade Commission ordered an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a long term energy policy'' to avoid abrupt gas-price
hikes in the future, the president said. ``Inherently there's
nothing wrong'' with suspending all of part of the federal gasoline
tax to ease prices, but that Congress would have to examine the
possibility of losing revenues on highway construction projects
funded through those taxes.

 &HT;    Sales projections ignite Coke stock
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola shares closed at their highest level in five
months Wednesday after the company said stronger markets around the
world are boosting sales.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based beverage giant said it expects case sales in
the second quarter to increase 5 percent to 6 percent. That
compared with a lackluster 3.5 percent in the first quarter and a
decline of 2 percent in last year's second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus on a localized marketing strategy is allowing us to
strengthen our relationships with consumers around the world,''
Chairman Doug Daft said in a prepared statement. ``This approach,
along with increasing economic stability in most regions of the
world, is resulting in improving volume trends during the second
quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Case volume _ the amount of product moved _ is a key indicator
of the company's financial health.
</P>
<P>
   The company's announcement propelled its shares to $60, up
$2.13, on almost double the normal trading volume.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, the stock is likely to trade in the low $60s,
predicted Sanford Bernstein analyst Bill Pecoriello. He expects it
to hit $70 within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Already, investors have been warming up to the stock. So far
this quarter, Coke shares have climbed nearly 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several important new things going on at Coke _ new
management, a new focus and a new global marketing and ad campaign
for brand Coke,'' said John Sicher, editor and publisher of
Beverage Digest. ``The company's turnaround has clearly begun and
is gaining momentum. It's clear that healthier and more prosperous
times lie ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the recently acquired Cadbury Schweppes brands in 161
nations outside the United States, case sales are still expected to
grow 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent in the second quarter. That
compared with 2 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   UBS Warburg analyst Caroline Levy was not impressed with the
announcement, downgrading the stock to a ``hold'' from a ``strong
buy.'' But other analysts viewed it more positively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm encouraged,'' said Goldman Sachs analyst Marc Cohen.
``This is probably the first time in 12 quarters that they seem to
be on the mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who currently recommends the stock, said he expects
``even more acceleration in the second half of the year. The
indications that they're at or modestly ahead of what we
anticipated for the second quarter makes us more comfortable that
they're on their way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst Andrew Conway, who has a
``neutral'' rating on the stock, said anticipated volume growth in
the second half of the year of 5.5 percent to 6 percent ``is not a
slam dunk.'' Still, Conway added, ``Coke is poised to experience
earnings-per-share growth in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 for the
first time in several years.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second quarter, Daft said the company remains
comfortable with analysts' earnings estimates averaging 41 cents a
share, compared with 38 cents a year ago, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   For the full year, Daft said the company is confident that it
will hit its previously announced target of 5 percent to 6 percent
volume growth, including the Schweppes brands. That would still,
however, be under Coca-Cola's long-term goal of growing case sales
at 7 percent to 8 percent a year. But it would considerably
overshadow last year's growth of only 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lot of work to do to bring the company back to
full stride,'' Cohen said. Next year, he predicts case sales will
rise 6 percent to 7 percent before returning to the long-term
target of 7 percent to 8 percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, Europe and Eurasia, where market
conditions had been dragging down the company's sales recently, are
expected to post the best volume results because of strong gains in
Germany, Spain and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Case sales for the region are expected to grow a robust 11
percent to 12 percent. Those figures are getting a partial boost
because of the comeback from last June's recall of company
beverages in Belgium that depressed sales there and in several
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   In North America, volume is expected to increase 2 percent in
the quarter, partly because of the prize-winning promotion on Coke
Classic cans, said company spokesman Robert Baskin.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Africa and the Middle East region is the only
place where case sales are expected to decline, excluding the
Schweppes brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more volatility than normal in Africa due to floods,
wars and other unfortunate incidents,'' Baskin said.

 &HT;    A headline would go in here jj like so for story
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Her name might be Mao, but she is no Maoist.
</P>
<P>
   Not even a Marxist, heaven forbid.
</P>
<P>
   As she sat in an office tower, gleaming in the sun above her
native Hong Kong's busy but picturesque harbor, Elley Mao sounded
far more like the capitalist imperialists who put her city on the
map of commerce in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The impeccably tailored Mao is an economist for the government
of Hong Kong and a life-long resident of the former British crown
colony that reverted to China at the stroke of midnight three years
ago July 1.
</P>
<P>
   As the whole world knows, many anticipated the change with
trepidation. Fearing the potentially heavy hand of communist rule,
thousands of Hong Kong's 6.7 million residents fled in the decade
before the handover _ if they were lucky enough to land passports
allowing their departure. Many of the overseas companies who do
business here _ now numbering more than 5,600, including 1,100 U.S.
businesses _ devised quick exit strategies to exercise if the rule
of law under which they had operated collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   But three years later, people have become accustomed to seeing
China's red flag flying where the Union Jack once flapped in the
uncertain breezes. And so far, Mao said, unification has brought
more symbolic than substantive changes. The fears were unfounded
and the message from the mainland has been a reassuring one, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the Beijing government said it would not
interfere with capitalism as usual in the area now designated a
Special Administrative Region of China. To this point, it has been
good to its word. And _ as Hong Kong begins its fourth year under
the Chinese flag _ the commercial outpost on the South China Sea
remains as eagerly open for business as ever. Commercials running
on local television even claim it is ``the best place in the world
for business.''
</P>
<P>
   The transfer of power, in fact, may have had less impact on Hong
Kong's economy than the Asian economic crisis that rippled through
the region's tiger economies soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   With the relatively quick recoveries in neighboring nations,
however, the world's ninth largest trading economy has been
rebounding since last year, Mao said. Today, both trade and
domestic retail demand are on the upswing, and Hong Kong has moved
onto the fast-track in adjusting to the new global era of a
knowledge-based high-tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   Even tourism, which hit a low of 9.5 million visitors in 1998,
the year after the handover, is again on the upswing. Hong Kong
expects 11.4 million visitors this year, just off the 11.7 million
of 1996, and it is moving full swing to develop new attractions,
including a Disney amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   If some people feared change after the British left, others as
eagerly welcomed the end of the colonial era. And they, too, seem
relatively pleased at the way events have unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``From China's angle, the return of Hong Kong to China is a very
important milestone in China's history,'' said Bassanio So, acting
Deputy Secretary for Constitutional Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   It was a milestone for Hong Kong residents, too, most of whom
think of themselves as Chinese, culturally and historically, said
Chu Wing-yin, a tour guide who urges English speakers to call her
``Winnie, as in Winnie the Pooh.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's school children may know little of contemporary
Chinese history or politics, but they grow up taking pride in
China's ancient dynasties, she said. And Chinese traditions have
always flourished here despite the city's cosmopolitan and outward
-looking lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, differences between Hong Kong and Beijing persist _
even in language.
</P>
<P>
   Though children are now being taught Mandarin _ the prevailing
dialect on the mainland _ many older Hong Kong residents speak only
Cantonese, Chu said. If she traveled to Beijing, she said, ``I do
not speak the language there so I would need a tour guide.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though half of Hong Kong's people live in public housing
and only a tiny percentage are among the super rich living in the
elegant mansions pointed out to tourists, Hong Kong residents often
speak with pride about ``our capitalist way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   And, even though only a limited form of democracy has been
developed to date, the people are committed to such ideas as
universal suffrage and human rights, So said.
</P>
<P>
   Free speech and public dissent are well-entrenched traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, Hong Kong police scuffled with dozens of
protestors who had moved here from the mainland but were being
denied the right to stay. That same day, disgruntled home owners
demonstrated against falling property prices and government doctors
publically protested against reductions in starting salaries.
Social workers, meanwhile, were marching to protest changes in
welfare funding.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the annual anniversary of the massacre of democracy
protestors in Beijing's Tiananmen Square always brings a major
protest _ one that would be instantly snuffed out by the
authorities in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, not all the legal aspects of having ``one country, two
systems,'' as the glib phrase goes, have been ironed out, So
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Fengchao, deputy director of China's liaison office in Hong
Kong, set off a furor in April when he told journalists to stop
reporting views that diverge from Beijing's official line on the
future of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   And thorny conflicts likely will continue to arise. The migrants
from the mainland who were protesting Sunday, for instance, were
granted residency rights in a Hong Kong that were effectively
revoked when Beijing lawmakers declared the ruling wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Hong Kong was granted full autonomy for 50 years
except in defense and foreign affairs, ``there must be some
interface'' in its relations with China and Chinese law, So said.
</P>
<P>
   In issues that do not directly involve relations between Hong
Kong and China, also, the former colony's government remains a work
in progress. While activists are pushing to expand self-government,
the makeup and scope of the legislature long-term are of the New

 &HT;    AIRLINES: TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM TO BLAME FOR MANY DELAYS
 &HT;    By MIRIAM A. GARCIA
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Airline representatives told the Senate Commerce
Committee Wednesday they have improved customer service but said
they're not entirely to blame for an increase in flight delays,
cancellations and missed connections.
</P>
<P>
   Aging air traffic control equipment has left planes on the
runways too long, backing up traffic and contributing to delays and
missed connections, said representatives from Continental and Delta
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some would blame the FAA for most of the delays, but the fact
is that they are doing the very best to keep up by managing our
aging and overburdened traffic control system with inadequate
resources and equipment,'' said Mary Jopplin, senior director for
customer service at Continental.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Congress considered enacting a ``passenger bill of
rights'' after a flood of complaints about delays and
cancellations. In one January 1999 incident, hundreds of passengers
were stuck in planes on runways in Detroit for up to eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines avoided the legislation after pledging to provide
better service. Instead, the Air Transportation Association of
America and 14 of its member airlines adopted a 12-point Customer
Service Commitment, which pledged to offer the lowest fares
available, provide prompt ticket refunds, and be more responsive to
customer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's hearing was to review the airlines' efforts to
improve service. The Inspector General's office for the U.S.
Department of Transportation has completed an interim review and
will issue a final report at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., challenged the
airlines to implement air traffic control reform if they are sure
that is the root of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I urge them to throw their weight and momentum behind a
serious, realistic plan for air traffic control reform. Otherwise
they will be accused of trying to shift the blame,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said delays have increased by more than 50 percent
and cancellations by 68 percent in the last five years. Most of the
delays occur after planes leave the gate. At the 28 largest U.S.
airports, the number of flights having delays of an hour or more
during taxi out times _ the time between leaving the gate and
taking off _ increased 130 percent between 1995 and 1999, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite an enormous effort, we are still not getting the
results that either you or we would like,'' Don Carty, the ATAA's
executive committee chairman, told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   One possible remedy is three years away. When it is completed,
the fifth runway at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport will
significantly decrease traffic at one of the country's busiest
airports, said Vicki Escarra, executive vice president for customer
service at Delta.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland D-Ga., said the additional runway is key to
improving service in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The report) will provide us and the carriers with a good
yardstick by which to measure the industry's performance and
indicate areas for improvement,'' Cleland said.
</P>
<P>
   The report found some airlines have invested in advanced baggage
scanning technologies to speed up the claims process for delayed
baggage. Other airlines were not consistent at returning baggage
within the 24 hours agreed to by the airlines, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, customers can often obtain cheaper fares on the
Internet than over the telephone, the report said.

ELIAN-FRIENDLY POLICIES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez went home Wednesday to a grateful Fidel Castro,
who with the help of Castro's Cuban-American enemies in Miami, used
the boy's plight in his decades-long effort to mask a failed
revolution. Cuban-Americans pursued their own failed policies this
week by toughening an innocuous bill to permit US agricultural
exports to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Six-year-old Elian ought to heve been returned to his father a
week or two after he was found off Florida in November. Now that
he's finally back home, the key question becomes what happens to
him and all the other Cubans once Castro, now 73, dies or otherwise
leaves power.
</P>
<P>
   The US economic embargo and political pressure have failed for
40 years to topple the Castro regime. It makes better sense to
engage the Cuban government and people with economic and
person-to-person contacts in the hope that Americans can influence
the Cubans toward political and economic freedom without
diminishing the gains made by the revolution in health and
education.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders of the House, in league with two
Cuban-American representatives from Florida, want no part of this.
They toughened a bill allowing agricultural sales so that Cuba
would not be able to get US loans and sought to codify into law the
presidential restrictions on Americans visiting the island.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans were unlikely to get many loans, and the travel language
allows the president to continue to show some discretion. So the
bill ought to be passed, despite these provisions. However, the
attitude behind the stronger wording suggests an inflexibility that
will make it harder for the United States to influence Cuban policy
whenever Castro goes.
</P>
<P>
   Castro is unfazed by the future. ``When a true revolution is
consolidated,'' he said last week, ``. . . no man, no matter how
important his personal contribution might have been, is
indispensable.''
</P>
<P>
   Change is inevitable, however. The United States has enormous
interests in making sure Cuba becomes democratic and prosperous
enough to discourage mass flight from the island. Cuban-Americans
will help Elian best by encouraging peaceful change, even if they
have to endure their bearded nemesis for a few years longer.

TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most unsettling about the Supreme Court term that ended with a
flurry Wednesday is the number of important cases decided by close
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Women have the right to choose a rare abortion procedure, the
Boy Scouts have the right to reject gay troop leaders, and persons
convicted of hate crimes have the right to sentences set by juries
as a result of decisions handed down this week. But all these
rights are guaranteed by the slimmest of margins _ 5-4 divisions of
the court.
</P>
<P>
   Only a slighter wider margin, 6-3, allows government to send
educational materials to religious schools and guarantees an
eight-foot buffer to persons entering an abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars like to say that the law is a living body, always
evolving. But this court is forcing too many people to live too
close to the edge.
</P>
<P>
   The most troubling of Wednesday's decisions was the one
legitimizing the unconscionable homophobic bias of the Boy Scouts.
James Dale, a Cub Scout at 8 and Boy Scout at 11, made Eagle Scout
at age 17 and the following year was named assistant scoutmaster of
Troop 73 in Matawan, N.J. Sixteen months later, local Scout
officials saw a newspaper story quoting Dale, then a student at
Rutgers, about a conference on gay and lesbian adolescents. The
officials dumped Dale, and he sued.
</P>
<P>
   To Dale, the Scout admonition to be ``morally straight'' meant
``to respect and defend the rights of all people.'' But the court
ruled that the Scouts are a private group entitled to restrict its
message rather than a public accommodation like the Jaycees, which
was forced to admit women under a 1984 ruling. No matter that Dale
made no effort to send a gay message. In its contorted decision,
the five-person court majority prevailed over the four dissenters
and a unanimous New Jersey Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Close court decisions can become solid law. The 1966 Miranda
ruling, requiring police to inform suspects of their rights, came
on a contentious 5-4 vote but was affirmed this week by a
comfortable 7-2 opinion. More often, 5-4 votes make all parties
nervous that the decisions themselves are fragile.
</P>
<P>
   These narrow majorities should send a clear message to voters to
consider the future of the court when they choose a president in
November.

CELEBRATE `INDEPENDENCE DAY'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year during the Fourth of July celebration, Americans show
their independence (at least from critical demands) by cramming
themselves in multiplexes to gawk at Hollywood's latest blockbuster
offerings rife with expensive action and special-effect sequences.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely do any of these films make critics' top-10 lists, but,
hey, so what? In 1996, the team of Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin
rolled out ``Independence Day,'' a story of locust-like aliens that
invade Earth. The plot, many critics thought, resembled a bad '50s
sci-fi film. But Emmerich and Devlin, who are currently responsible
for turning Mel Gibson into a Mad Max-like ``Patriot,'' charged
ahead with so much panache that the ``biggest B movie of all
time,'' as Variety called it, turned out to be a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week _ in true blockbuster fashion _ Fox released
the ``Five Star Collection Independence Day,'' a two-disc DVD. The
first disc includes a special edition of the film with nine
additional minutes of footage.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the scenes help clarify the relationship between Randy
Quaid, a drunken crop duster and former Vietnam War pilot who had
been abducted by aliens (that description alone is enough to make
most critics cringe). While they fit fairly seamlessly into the
film, they don't really add much to it, either. The scene where a
crazed scientist (Brent Spiner) shows off the inner workings of the
alien spacecraft to computer scientist David (Jeff Goldblum) does
have some wit to it, though. Disc 1 also includes scene commentary
from Devlin and Emmerich, as well as special-effects wizards Volker
Engel and Doug Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The interesting stuff is on Disc 2, which includes the original
ending, where Quaid's character destroys the alien spacecraft while
flying a biplane instead of a jet fighter. Even Devlin and Emmerich
found this too ludicrous, but it's a hoot to watch. The disc also
includes a 30-minute making of-documentary, which explains the wide
range of the special effects used in the movie, an alien invasion
``mockumentary'' and HBO's ``First Look'' featurette. Some of this
is overkill; we learn in minute detail how they blow up the White
House (it was a miniature).
</P>
<P>
   What comes through is just how much effort and thought was put
into creating this film. Makes you glad they weren't trying to take
over the world. Mmmm, maybe they were.
</P>
<P>
   !folo!Speaking of Mel: Though George Miller's ``The Road
Warrior'' (1981) _ the second part of the Mad Max trilogy _ made
Mel Gibson a star in America, it was Richard Donner's ``Lethal
Weapon'' in 1987 that made him a superstar. Earlier in the month,
Warners released the director's cut of the first three films in the
series.
</P>
<P>
   As Martin Riggs, the suicidal ex-Vietnam War special-service vet
turn L.A. detective, Gibson is a hero with an edge _ cool but
vulnerable. Danny Glover as his older partner makes a nice
counterpoint. As they chase after the bad guys, their buddy
relationship develops giving what would be a might have been just a
run-of-the-mill action picture an emotional underpinning.
</P>
<P>
   ``LW2'' (1989) is the best of the four films and introduces Joe
Pesci as an accountant on the run from the mob who the boys have to
guard, and in doing so, Donner cranked up the humor also using it
to take advantage of Gibson and Glover's onscreen chemistry. All
three DVDs, as expected, contain additional scenes.
</P>
<P>
   OK, ``Independence Day'' and ``Lethal Weapon'' aren't new, but
they're still fun and you won't have to wait in line at your local
cineplex. &QL; 
----- &QL; 
The ```Independence Day: Special Edition'' is $34.98. The price of
the ``Director's Cut'' DVD of the first three ``Lethal Weapon''
films is $24.90 each.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Police know they can do job
 &HT;    and still observe Miranda
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist calls it ``part of our national
culture,'' and so it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans know by heart what comes after ``You are under
arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be
used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an
attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed
for you.
</P>
<P>
   It's your right, and it's right for officers to have to explain
it to you.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court reaffirmed the so-called Miranda law Monday
with a ruling that should put to rest challenges to the 1966
Supreme Court ruling that created it.
</P>
<P>
   It is reassuring to hear Rehnquist distance himself from the
court's conservative wing on this matter and say that duration as
law of the land means something. It's the concept of stare decisis
which commonly is derided by those who think ``original intent'' of
the Constitution and the Bill of Rights is all that matters. For
instance, they'll argue that the 14th Amendment guarantee of due
process and equal protection can't apply to women and minorities in
general, since its authors had only emancipated slaves in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than set in stone, the Constitution is a living,
breathing document that adjusts to meet the times. Miranda is one
such adjustment necessary to guard against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a terrible setback to civil rights in this country
if it were to turn the clock back to before Miranda, and before
broadened interpretations of the 14th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   While police organizations had hoped that Miranda could be
abolished or refined, police know that they can do their jobs
effectively within Miranda's confines, because it has become a way
of life for them. It is the American way.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda is not the officer's enemy. It is the officer's ally.
Miranda warnings protect the credibility of police and the
government by giving the public a measure of assurance that all
citizens are treated fairly and equally, and that no citizen is
coerced into self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The job of law enforcement isn't simply to make an arrest stick.
It is to make sure that justice is done, that due process is
followed every step of the way.

PERFECT STORM, IMPERFECT MOVIE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm'' lives up to its title. But that doesn't
mean its a good movie. While the technicians at Industrial Light &AMP;
Magic have worked overtime to create a roiling squall that will
have you reaching for some Dramamine, the film rarely manages to
generate much in the way of suspense or terror. You might as well
stay home and watch the Weather Channel; at least then, you wont
have to suffer through the godawful dialogue here.
</P>
<P>
   This is a movie that's great as long as nobody talks.
Unfortunately, there's a lot of yakking in Bill Wittliff's witless
adaptation of Sebastian Junger's best-seller, not to mention
shallow characterizations and trumped- up drama. Director Wolfgang
Petersen, who knows a thing or two about water with ``Das Boot'' on
his resume, doesn't help matters much, either, clumsily cutting
from story to story without genuinely conveying the horror of the
films events.
</P>
<P>
   Junger's book certainly offered plenty of rich detail, but,
typically, the film version has discarded anything approaching
complexity, instead throwing out by-the-numbers chum, thinking the
audience will bite. In fact, the condescending writing here seems
to assume most moviegoers area bunch of dolts since it has the
characters spell out in bland detail exactly what's happening at
any given moment.
</P>
<P>
   The most annoying example of this patronizing approach occurs
during the movie's initial set-up, which is all about conveying the
hardships and dangers of a fisherman's life. Watching the movie,
you'd think these guys were going to the moon or Omaha Beach during
D-Day instead of trolling for swordfish off the local coast. And
did we really need Chris McDonald's boorish weatherman to stupidly
explain the storms ferocity? Wouldn't a snippet from a local
newscast have sufficed?
</P>
<P>
   The film's central characters are the crew of the Andrea Gail, a
group of Gloucester, Mass., fishermen who, after a string of
disappointing catches, venture out into the North Atlantic looking
for one last haul. Their timing couldn't have been worse, with
three storms _ a hurricane moving up the coast from Bermuda, a cold
front sweeping down from Canada and a North Atlantic gale _
converging at once, creating massive waves and a mountain of water
that's swallowing everything in its path.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's captain (George Clooney) must decide whether to stay
in safe waters and lose his precious cargo of swordfish (the boat's
ice machine has broken, so the fish don't have a long shelf life)
or brave the storm and head back to harbor. Complicating matters is
the loss of the ship's radio antennae, which limits the captain's
knowledge about the weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   A parallel story involving a Coast Guard rescue of a sailboat
takes up much of the latter half of the film and is often more
interesting than the events surrounding the fishermen. But then,
once the movie lands in the heart of the storm, it becomes vastly
more entertaining anyway, even if Petersen can't quite figure out a
way to move between the two tales, which is partially due to the
unpredictability of the story's events.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly are among the actors who
try to flesh out characters that are as wooden as an old seafarer's
peg leg; Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio plays a rival fishing captain
trying to warn the Gail of the severity of the storm. The waves, of
course, are the real stars of the movie, and they're rendered
convincingly, even as the rest of ``The Perfect Storm'' is
submerged in stupidity. &QL;

WALL STREET COOL TO GENUITY IPO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Genuity Inc.'s initial stock sale _ one of the year's biggest
public offerings _ received an unenthusiastic reception on Wall
Street Wednesday amid concerns over the Internet company's massive
losses and future ownership.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet-infrastructure firm, based in
Burlington, &UR;  &LR; Mass., still managed to end the day as one of
Massachusetts's corporate giants. With a market capitalization of
about $9 billion, Genuity joins the same league that counts as its
members Raytheon Co., Gillette Co., EMC Corp., and CMGI Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Genuity dropped $1.59375 on the Nasdaq to close at
$9.40625, even as technology stocks rallied following the Federal
Reserve's decision to leave interest rates untouched. The company's
173.9 million shares were initially priced at $11 _ short of the
anticipated range of $12 to $15.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the IPO's underwriters misjudged the demand
for such a large offering. Genuity spooked investors who have grown
wary of money-losing Internet firms. Since April, a cruel month for
technology stocks, the markets have become kinder _ but not to
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of coming back,'' said Mary Lupo, an analyst with
Renaissance Capital IPO Aftermarket Fund in Greenwich, Conn. ``But
it also depends on what kind of company it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, investors warmly greeted microchip maker Marvell
Technology Group Ltd. and software firm Click Commerce Inc.,
turning their IPOs this week into successes. But these companies
have turned a profit. Genuity, on the other hand, lost $626.7
million on revenue of $750.4 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are showing tremendous losses at a time when losses are
no longer fashionable,'' said Pascal Aguirre, vice president of
Renaissance Strategy, a Boston-based consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also may be leery of paying top dollar for shares in a
firm that could eventually be controlled by the nation's largest
local telephone company, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   GTE is spinning off Genuity so it can satisfy federal regulators
and merge with Bell Atlantic Corp., creating telephone service
giant Verizon Communications. As part of the deal, which is
expected to close by the end of the month, Verizon is being forced
to divest all but 9.5 percent of Genuity.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the catch: Verizon could repurchase up to 82 percent
of Genuity if local telephone service in the 13 states covered by
Bell Atlantic is successfully opened to competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, it's a Bell Atlantic company,'' said Drake
Johnstone, an analyst with the investment firm Davenport &AMP; Co. in
Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly known as GTE Internetworking, Genuity can trace its
lineage back to the Web's Wild West days. Its predecessor, Bolt,
Beranek &AMP; Newman, designed the foundation for today's Internet and
pioneered the use of the (at) symbol so widely used in e-mail
messaging.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Genuity is one of the largest Internet backbone companies
in the nation, operating more than 17,000 miles of fiber-optic
cables carrying and directing Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Genuity gets most of its revenue from Internet access charges,
with its biggest customer, America Online, making up 52 percent of
its sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Genuity plans to use much of the $1.9 billion raised in its
initial public offering to better position to expand its
fiber-optic network and expand its Web-site hosting business and
other services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a lot of positives going for it,'' said Steve Tuen, an
analyst with IPO Value Monitor. ``Bell Atlantic and GTE should be
big backers of Genuity.''
</P>
<P>
   But Genuity will face strong competition from a host of
companies, including Sprint and Cable &AMP; Wireless. Its strongest
rival is WorldCom's UUNet Technologies division, which has the
largest piece of the Internet access business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genuity is losing a pot-load of money, while I think most
people in this marketplace realize that UUNet is a cash cow for
WorldCom,'' analyst Johnstone said.

PLEASED WITH `MODERATING' GROWTH, FED STANDS PAT ON RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taking a summer respite after a series of interest-rate
increases, the Federal Reserve Board voted Wednesday against
raising rates further amid signs US economic growth may be
``moderating.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Fed's decision was widely expected and caused barely a
ripple on Wall Street, what was not expected was so explicit a
statement by the Fed sizing up the status of the nation's
unprecedented economic expansion. ``Recent data suggests that the
expansion of aggregate demand may be moderating toward a pace
closer to the rate of growth of the economy's potential to
produce,'' the Fed said in a policy statement.
</P>
<P>
   Despite encouraging signs of a slowdown, the Fed adopted an
official ``bias'' toward further rate hikes in the future if
inflationary pressures do not ease.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Open Market Committee, which has added 1.75
percentage points to the federal funds rate since last June in six
rounds of tightening, voted to leave the rate unchanged at 6.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee's statement, which left plenty of room to
boost rates, possibly at their next meeting August 22, also
contained striking contrasts _ noting signs of slowdown and a
potential easing of inflationary pressures while remaining on alert
about inflation. This was read by some analysts as an indication of
spirited debate among Fed members in reaching the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was obviously a good deal of debate, particularly about
whether this slowdown is temporary or could be more permanent,''
said David Jones, a veteran Fed watcher for Aubrey Lanston &AMP; Co. in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The US economy in the fourth quarter of last year posted 7.3
percent growth in real gross domestic product, a pace more typical
of a developing economy than the world's biggest industrial
producer. In the first quarter, growth slowed to a
still-breathtaking 5.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Fed implied the economy, in the second quarter, may be
shifting to a lower gear. This marked a change from past policy
statements in which members indicated growth was far outpacing
available supply, putting a strain on resources and the pool of
workers and stoking inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the Fed's primary evidence of a slowdown were
federal data showing the private sector shrank its payrolls by
116,000 in June _ a report economists view as inconclusive _ and
more compelling data showing sales of automobiles and homes were
slowing.
</P>
<P>
   In another indication of softening retail sales, the Conference
Board in New York reported just hours prior to the FOMC meeting
that its widely watched index of consumer confidence slid nearly
six points in June. Consumers, which account for about two-thirds
of total US demand, have been a powerful engine of the nation's
growth during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is nevertheless far from conclusive, and there are
other indicators _ durable goods orders, for example _ that show
growth continues at a breakneck pace, offering no assurance that a
``soft landing'' is in the works as a result of the Fed's actions
over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market had little reaction to the Fed action and ended
the day at nearly the same levels reached prior to the
late-afternoon decision. The Dow Jones industrial stock average
gained 23.33 points Wednesday, closing at 10,527.79, while the
technology-dominated Nasdaq rose 81.38 points to 3940.34.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Sinai, president of Primark Decision Economics in Boston,
noted the FOMC when it sits down to debate policy again in August
will have the advantage of two more months of data, on prices,
wages and second-quarter growth on which to base a decision.
</P>
<P>
   At the June meeting, Fed members faced more questions than they
had answers, highlighting the difficulty of fine-tuning the US
economy. ``A slowdown is there, but is it for real. And if it's for
real, what is its pace? And beyond that, what would be the response
of inflation?'' Sinai said. ``The bottom line for the Fed is
containing inflation risk. There's a long way to go to concluding
the future risk on inflation is diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's remarks about inflation acknowledged ``core''
inflation _ the consumer price index minus energy and housing _ has
accelerated slightly over the past year. That seemed a nod to
arguments made publicly by Laurence Meyer, a vocal inflation hawk
on the FOMC.
</P>
<P>
   But, the committee, bowing to more dovish sentiments of its
chairman, Alan Greenspan, said inflation seems to have a
counterbalance in the high levels of productivity of US workers,
which ``have been containing costs and holding down inflationary
pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever vigilant about inflation, the Fed said it would continue to
hold a bias in favor of tightening in the future, repeating a
stance in the May meeting and using language that has become
boilerplate in recent months. The FOMC ``believes the risks
continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate
heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future,'' the Fed
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's view on inflation ``is bi-polar,'' said Richard
Yamarone, chief economist for Argus Research Corp., a New York
research company. ``On the one hand, their statement implies
inflationary pressures have not subsided,'' he said, yet ``they
refrained from raising rates. What's the real answer?''
</P>
<P>
   John Zaehringer, chief economist in the Boston office of Loomis
Sayles &AMP; Co., predicted the Fed would raise rates by 25 basis
points in August. The central bank, in choosing not to tighten, has
accepted the risk it may be opening a door to inflation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed has accepted that risk several times in the past few
years'' and its success in reading inflation signals and reacting
prudently to them has been ``one of Greenspan's triumphs as
chairman of the Fed,'' Zaehringer said.

   SCOTUS-ABORTION (Washington) _ The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday
by a 5-4 vote that because the procedure widely known as ``partial
birth abortion'' may be the most medically appropriate way of
terminating some pregnancies, the government cannot prohibit
doctors from performing it. The decision declared unconstitutional
the Nebraska law before the court, as well as, in effect, the laws
of 30 other states. In addition, the bill to create a federal ban
on the procedure, which President Clinton has vetoed twice and
which may reach his desk again this year, would also be
unconstitutional under the court's analysis: Like all the other
laws, it does not contain an exception for the health of the
pregnant woman. By Linda Greenhouse.

   SCOTUS-GAY-SCOUTS (Washington) _ The Supreme Court ruled
Wednesday by a 5-4 vote that the Boy Scouts have a constitutional
right to exclude gay members because opposition to homosexuality
was part of the organization's ``expressive message.'' Writing for
the court Wednesday, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said the
court intended neither to approve nor disapprove the Boy Scouts'
views on the subject, but that the First Amendment's protection for
freedom of association meant that the state could not compel the
Boy Scouts ``to accept members where such acceptance would derogate
from the organization's expressive message.'' By Linda Greenhouse.

   RACE-PAPER (Akron, Ohio) _ In New York in 1994, Carl Chancellor
and Bob Dyer looked like tourists, snapping pictures at the Statue
of Liberty, savoring Jamaican food at a trendy restaurant, clinking
beer bottles and wineglasses in heady toasts back at their hotel.
More than tourists, they were colleagues out on the town
celebrating. Chancellor and Dyer were part of a team of reporters
for The Akron Beacon Journal that had explored the racial attitudes
of this city of 215,000 people. Their series earned the paper
journalism's big award, the Pulitzer Prize. In Akron, there were
congratulatory speeches for a staff that had united behind the
series and gloried in having been a healing force in the city. The
Beacon Journal also tried to lead by example. Shortly after the
series ended, it introduced a lineup of columnists reflecting ``the
perfect demographic,'' as Dyer put it. They included a black woman
and a white woman as well as Chancellor, who is black, and Dyer,
who is white. The paper, it seemed, had become a proud model of
racial enlightenment. Which made it all the more startling when,
just a year later, the jubilation began to fade _ for the men and
the newsroom. Troubled by the state of race relations, The Beacon
Journal had gone further than most newspapers to investigate the
gap between blacks and whites and to understand why it had not
closed. It found mistrust and misperceptions, frustrations and
tensions; it even looked inward, discovering much the same in its
own newsroom. It had found, it seemed, a way to talk about race.
And yet even here, in a place where men and women make a living
seeking answers to questions and using words well, communication
can break down. And race still seeps back in. Many among the 157
people on the news staff _ 15 percent of whom are black and 4
percent other minorities _ say that although the city's racial
climate may have improved because of the series, seven years later,
the newspaper itself has shown less progress. By Dana Canedy. (6240

SPEECHWORKS TO OFFER PORTAL LINK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speech technology start-up SpeechWorks International of Boston
is moving to grab a leadership position in the emerging Web ``voice
portal'' business, announcing it is offering a new open-source
software to link speech portals to each other.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that resembles the Linux open-source software
programming code movement, SpeechWorks is making public a system
companies could use to develop and interconnect sites on which
people call in by phone and use their voice to request news
information that is then read back to them, or conduct transactions
such as buying stocks and airplane tickets.
</P>
<P>
   With open-source programming, instead of being able to reach
only individual companies or sites linked to services such as
TellMe, people might be able to call one number and reach hundreds
of different sites, using their voices to skip among them as they
would a mouse to click among Web pages on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   As the start-up gears up for an initial public offering this
summer, SpeechWorks officials are gambling that by giving away
their so-called voice XML code, they can fuel faster growth in the
voice portal business and take a big piece of a more quickly
growing pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today there are really no standards for linking'' voice
portals ``and no standards for browsing,'' said Steve Chambers,
SpeechWorks marketing vice president. ``We really want to offer
this as our version of the hypertext link in the Web world.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the technology fueling products SpeechWorks is rolling
out, including a SpeechBrowser and an internetworking system called
SpeechLinks, comes from AT&AMP;T Labs, in particular its vocabulary of
1 million words that can be interpreted through speech recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The phone giant earlier this month took an unspecified stake in
SpeechWorks as part of a deal giving the company access to vast
troves of AT&AMP;T speech technology.
</P>
<P>
   An example of how the new technology might work would be someone
calling an airline voice portal to hear times for a flight to New
York, book the flight, then ask to be transferred to a hotel
booking speech site, make a reservation, and ask to be transferred
to a restaurant search service and a Broadway show ticket agency.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many of those businesses do not have speech-activated Web
portals. And if they do, there normally is no easy way to go from
one to the next without starting a new phone call.
</P>
<P>
   SpeechWorks, California-based Nuance, Lernout &AMP; Hauspie, and
other companies have developed to date about 300 speech sites in
the United States, according to industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   With Americans buying wireless phones at the rate of one every
2.5 seconds and early versions of wireless Net access over phones
showing severe limitations, many industry analysts think Web-based
sites that respond to spoken commands will prove far more popular
with people than using the phone keypad to have information
displayed on the phone screen.

 &HT;    Hong Kong accustomed to rule under China
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Her name might be Mao, but she is no Maoist.
</P>
<P>
   Not even a Marxist, heaven forbid.
</P>
<P>
   As she sat in an office tower, gleaming in the sun above her
native Hong Kong's busy but picturesque harbor, Elley Mao sounded
far more like the capitalist imperialists who put her city on the
map of commerce in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The impeccably tailored Mao is an economist for the government
of Hong Kong and a life-long resident of the former British crown
colony that reverted to China at the stroke of midnight three years
ago July 1.
</P>
<P>
   As the whole world knows, many anticipated the change with
trepidation. Fearing the potentially heavy hand of communist rule,
thousands of Hong Kong's 6.7 million residents fled in the decade
before the handover _ if they were lucky enough to land passports
allowing their departure. Many of the overseas companies who do
business here _ now numbering more than 5,600, including 1,100 U.S.
businesses _ devised quick exit strategies to exercise if the rule
of law under which they had operated collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   But three years later, people have become accustomed to seeing
China's red flag flying where the Union Jack once flapped in the
uncertain breezes. And so far, Mao said, unification has brought
more symbolic than substantive changes. The fears were unfounded
and the message from the mainland has been a reassuring one, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the Beijing government said it would not
interfere with capitalism as usual in the area now designated a
Special Administrative Region of China. To this point, it has been
good to its word. And _ as Hong Kong begins its fourth year under
the Chinese flag _ the commercial outpost on the South China Sea
remains as eagerly open for business as ever. Commercials running
on local television even claim it is ``the best place in the world
for business.''
</P>
<P>
   The transfer of power, in fact, may have had less impact on Hong
Kong's economy than the Asian economic crisis that rippled through
the region's tiger economies soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   With the relatively quick recoveries in neighboring nations,
however, the world's ninth largest trading economy has been
rebounding since last year, Mao said. Today, both trade and
domestic retail demand are on the upswing, and Hong Kong has moved
onto the fast-track in adjusting to the new global era of a
knowledge-based high-tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   Even tourism, which hit a low of 9.5 million visitors in 1998,
the year after the handover, is again on the upswing. Hong Kong
expects 11.4 million visitors this year, just off the 11.7 million
of 1996, and it is moving full swing to develop new attractions,
including a Disney amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   If some people feared change after the British left, others as
eagerly welcomed the end of the colonial era. And they, too, seem
relatively pleased at the way events have unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``From China's angle, the return of Hong Kong to China is a very
important milestone in China's history,'' said Bassanio So, acting
Deputy Secretary for Constitutional Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   It was a milestone for Hong Kong residents, too, most of whom
think of themselves as Chinese, culturally and historically, said
Chu Wing-yin, a tour guide who urges English speakers to call her
``Winnie, as in Winnie the Pooh.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's school children may know little of contemporary
Chinese history or politics, but they grow up taking pride in
China's ancient dynasties, she said. And Chinese traditions have
always flourished here despite the city's cosmopolitan and outward
-looking lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, differences between Hong Kong and Beijing persist _
even in language.
</P>
<P>
   Though children are now being taught Mandarin _ the prevailing
dialect on the mainland _ many older Hong Kong residents speak only
Cantonese, Chu said. If she traveled to Beijing, she said, ``I do
not speak the language there so I would need a tour guide.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though half of Hong Kong's people live in public housing
and only a tiny percentage are among the super rich living in the
elegant mansions pointed out to tourists, Hong Kong residents often
speak with pride about ``our capitalist way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   And, even though only a limited form of democracy has been
developed to date, the people are committed to such ideas as
universal suffrage and human rights, So said.
</P>
<P>
   Free speech and public dissent are well-entrenched traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, Hong Kong police scuffled with dozens of
protestors who had moved here from the mainland but were being
denied the right to stay. That same day, disgruntled home owners
demonstrated against falling property prices and government doctors
publically protested against reductions in starting salaries.
Social workers, meanwhile, were marching to protest changes in
welfare funding.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the annual anniversary of the massacre of democracy
protestors in Beijing's Tiananmen Square always brings a major
protest _ one that would be instantly snuffed out by the
authorities in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, not all the legal aspects of having ``one country, two
systems,'' as the glib phrase goes, have been ironed out, So
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Fengchao, deputy director of China's liaison office in Hong
Kong, set off a furor in April when he told journalists to stop
reporting views that diverge from Beijing's official line on the
future of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   And thorny conflicts likely will continue to arise. The migrants
from the mainland who were protesting Sunday, for instance, were
granted residency rights in a Hong Kong that were effectively
revoked when Beijing lawmakers declared the ruling wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Hong Kong was granted full autonomy for 50 years
except in defense and foreign affairs, ``there must be some
interface'' in its relations with China and Chinese law, So said.
</P>
<P>
   In issues that do not directly involve relations between Hong
Kong and China, also, the former colony's government remains a work
in progress. While activists are pushing to expand self-government,
the makeup and scope of the legislature long-term are under debate,
with a decision on introducing a greater level of democracy due by
2007.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Hong Kong residents happily welcomed the new
millennium with a horse race and fireworks earlier this year at
their famous Happy Valley race track. And, for the most part, So
said, as the anniversary of the handover from Britain to China
approaches, ``people are quite happy'' with the re-unification.
</P>
<P>
   Even the gaps between Beijing and Hong Kong will narrow over
time, many think. ``China is changing, too ... and changing
rapidly,'' Mao predicted.
</P>
<P>
   And if Hong Kong, for now, remains the home of the ``capitalist
imperialist'' alternative to Beijing's brand of communism, so be
it, joked So. As long as good faith efforts continue to make ``one
country, two systems'' work, the people of Hong Kong will be proud
to take their place with China, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And what is that place? So used an analogy to soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Hong Kong and China play, we are for Hong Kong,'' he said.
``But if China plays anyone else, we are for China.''

 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is Chase Manhattan Bank ready, finally, to join the
big leagues of investment banking?
</P>
<P>
   This is the bank, after all, that was practically a laughing
stock on Wall Street a couple of years ago when it so visibly
failed to persuade Merrill Lynch or any other big-name brokerage
firm to accept a takeover bid. Instead, it settled for consolation
prizes, agreeing to pay billions of dollars to acquire the
much-smaller Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, which specializes in technology,
and Robert Fleming Holdings, a venerable London merchant banking
firm.
</P>
<P>
   So when Chase announced in late May that it had agreed to buy
the obscure Beacon Group for an estimated $450 million _ an
investment banking boutique started by Geoffrey T. Boisi, a former
star at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. _ it looked to some like yet another
expensive acquisition in a piecemeal attempt at building an
investment banking presence.
</P>
<P>
   For years Chase has been the place corporations turned to when
they needed money to finance their own acquisitions, a business
synonymous with the hostile takeovers of the 1980s. But to compete
with Morgan Stanley, Goldman, Merrill Lynch and the like _ all of
which excel not only in finance but also in the much more
prestigious and lucrative specialities of providing merger advice
and offering new stock to the public _ Chase needed to look and act
more like them.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, for all its success in commercial banking on a global
scale, has an image problem in the clubbier precincts of Wall
Street. And that was only reinforced earlier this year when James
B. Lee Jr., the 18-year veteran head of investment banking at
Chase, was championed on the cover of Forbes magazine, complete
with a list of takeover targets and this message to Chase clients:
``We'll write you a check.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street insiders were struck by how Lee (universally called
Jimmy within the business) appeared as a promotional, highly
aggressive '80s-style power broker. So much so, claimed Michael
Mayo, a senior bank analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, a
competitor, that institutional shareholders he talked to ``actually
sold shares based on that Forbes story.'' He added, ``It was
arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was a shock when Chase announced, as part of the
Beacon acquisition, that Lee, 47, would spend more time with
clients and that Boisi would become his boss. The not-so-subtle
signal, analysts said, was that Chase was willing to go to any
lengths to join the inner circle, even at the risk of alienating
Lee, one of the most powerful executives at Chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy did a fantastic job building Chase's business,'' Mayo
said. ``But this shows how much the bank is committed to going to
the next level. There are different personalities needed for
different times in a company's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Boisi, 53, is indeed a different personality, a well-regarded
adviser who for 21 years thrived in the intense but self-effacing
business atmosphere at Goldman. He reached the third most powerful
spot there before leaving in the early 1990s after failing to be
named to the top position at the firm that was taken by senior
partners Robert Rubin and Stephen Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   His comeback was engineered by William Harrison, Chase's chief
executive, who surprised Boisi during a routine strategy session in
early May when he asked him to join the company. For more than two
years Boisi had been advising Chase's top echelon, first Walter
Shipley and then, after he retired as chief executive, Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt they had similar fundamental values,'' said Boisi, who
will become Chase's head of investment banking in July. ``Right at
the top there was a collegial partnership and that felt good.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison insisted that the Forbes article about Lee ``had
nothing to do with the changes at Chase.'' Lee, he said, had been
looking to spend less time on administration and Chase needed a
skilled manager, having gained more than 200 new professionals with
the recent acquisitions. The bank also expanded its venture capital
operations, Chase Capital Partners, which invests in emerging
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But other Chase executives said that Harrison was not pleased
with Lee's portrayal in the story and wanted to move quickly to
shake things up. Negotiations between Boisi and Harrison lasted
less than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And even the day before the announcement, one executive said, it
was not clear whether Lee would stay. A former executive said that
Lee described the management shuffle to some friends and colleagues
as getting ``whacked.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Lee said he welcomes the change.
Earlier this year he cut the number of people who report to him,
voluntarily sharing the responsibility with other Chase executives,
so that he could spend more time with clients. And, so far, the
talk about him leaving is untrue. ``I just got off the phone with a
senior person at a competitor and I told him I was happy,'' Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Boisi's return to a big institution striving to get
ahead sets up a powerful personal drama with Chase's Wall Street
rivals. Not only will he be going head-to-head against his former
colleagues at Goldman, Boisi also faces a formidable competitor at
Citigroup, where Rubin, the former U.S. Treasury secretary who once
shared the top spot at Goldman, is now Citi's co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he was prepared for the contest, Boisi did not
answer directly, instead offering an anecdote to make his point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years and years ago I used to ask young recruits, `What do you
want on your tombstone?''' he said. One day one of the recruits
turned the question on him. He thought about it, he said, and
replied, ``To be a successful, respected competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he relishes the challenge. And challenge it will
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of cultural meshing to be done,'' said Judah
Krushaar, a bank analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``The question is how do
they take all these capabilities and drive them into Chase's bigger
customer base.''

   Boisi was born in 1947, the second of six children and raised in
a devout Catholic home in Westbury, on Long Island. His father,
James, was a vice chairman at J.P. Morgan; his mother Edith, a
homemaker. He attended Boston College where, on the last day of his
freshman year, he met his wife, Rene.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1969 with a degree in English, Boisi
immediately went to the Wharton School of Business at the
University of Pennsylvania, where he got his M.B.A. in 1971. He was
recruited by Goldman, becoming just the fourth person in what was
then a fledgling mergers and acquisitions practice.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take long for the ambitious young Boisi to become a
star. Mergers-and-acquisitions was once a genteel business, but as
the new era of hostile takeovers was born, Goldman moved from
insisting on only representing corporations seeking to fend off a
takeover to a being a full participant on all sides. Boisi was soon
involved in nearly every major takeover battle of the 1980s _
including advising buyout firm Forstmann Little &AMP; Co. in the epic
1988 battle for RJR Nabisco that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co.
ultimately won.
</P>
<P>
   At 31, Boisi became Goldman's youngest partner. In 1980 he
became head of the mergers-and-acquisitions department and in 1986,
he took sole responsibility for running the investment banking
division, where he spent four years at the helm, helping to create
Goldman's now formidable global finance presence.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, he still bursts with pride over what his old firm has
accomplished: ``Goldman Sachs is considered to be a pretty good
place,'' he says, ``and I had something to do with that.''
</P>
<P>
   He seems to have made few enemies in his rise, a rarity in the
backstabbing world of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geoff was very well-organized, disciplined and exceedingly
focused,'' Rubin says. ``He is a very decent guy.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, former colleagues say, what distinguished Boisi at
Goldman, which prides itself on collegiality, was his zeal for
argument. ``His personality fills a room,'' said Robin Neustein, a
managing director at Goldman who worked with him.
</P>
<P>
   But Boisi also took time to attract and shelter new talent. ``I
was always a believer in giving opportunities to the younger
people,'' he said. At Goldman, he even played football with junior
analysts on weekends, and trolled university campuses looking for
promising undergraduates. ``I was trying to identify who the
leaders were and talk to them and get them on board,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boisi brought that same intensity to his activities off Wall
Street. Richard Syron, the former president of the American Stock
Exchange who served as vice chairman for Boston College's board of
trustees when Boisi was chairman, recalled one spring in the early
1990s when they were responsible for finding a new president for
the college.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had constructed this extraordinary process, a two-week
schedule for gathering information,'' Syron said. ``We talked to
the dean of every school, every member of the board, past and
present, every department head and a lot of alumni.'' And the was
before the search began. All told the two spent 100 hours _ working
late into the evenings _ listening to every important person
affected by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's quite cerebral in a way that does not come across as
purely intellectual,'' Syron said. ``Geoff is someone who starts
looking at something at a macro level and drills down to the
details to see how they fit in a larger picture.''
</P>
<P>
   So why didn't Boisi end up running Goldman? Wall Street
executives where surprised when he resigned in 1991. But he would
have had to wait a considerable time until Rubin and Friedman, who
had recently been named co-chairmen, left their posts. The irony
is, had Boisi stayed, he would most likely have been named their
successor in 1994, less time then he expected to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what I was giving up,'' he said of that time. He was
silent for a moment, before recounting the moment he made up his
mind to leave. It was early 1991, and he had taken a business trip
to Australia to make a three hour-presentation to a client. After
the meeting, he caught a flight to Rome, where he spent half a day
recruiting a potential Goldman board member.
</P>
<P>
   All told, he said, he spent more than 24 hours on planes _ plus
the time in meetings _ away from his wife and four children.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Thursday was completely obliterated from my life,'' he
said. ``Given what I wanted to do with the kids and my life I
thought it was healthy to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   For two years after that he devoted his efforts to the National
Mentoring Partnership, an organization he co-founded in 1989 which
matches up students with corporate mentors. And in 1993, he started
the investment advisory firm Beacon, which would become a
collection of friends and former Goldman colleagues, including
David Coulter, the former chairman of BankAmerica Corp. and Richard
Herbst, a former Goldman banker.
</P>
<P>
   Boisi now says that he is not daunted that at an age when many
Wall Street executives are looking to spend more time in the
Hamptons or other leisurely pursuits, he will be starting over,
again logging long hours at the office, on planes and in meetings
hoping to create at Chase the successful atmosphere that made
Goldman what it is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be building, person by person,'' he said. ``We are
going to be guerrilla warriors. That is going to be instilled.'' &QL;

CLINTON DECRIES `BOGUS' SCANDALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Wednesday rejected charges that
the scandals of his administration were dragging down Al Gore's
campaign for president, saying that a lot of the ``so-called
scandals were bogus'' and that the word itself has been ``thrown
around here like a clanging teapot for seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said polls showing Gore trailing Texas Governor George
W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, were an
indication that voters were ``still trying to figure out what they
think about this race.'' In the end, he said, he didn't believe
people would hold Gore ``responsible for anything I did that they
didn't agree with or that was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   During an hourlong news conference in the East Room of the White
House, Clinton said he would be inclined to sign a bill to allow
food and drug sales to Cuba once his concerns that the legislation
not restrict travel to the country and thus undermine
``people-to-people contact'' were resolved.
</P>
<P>
   And he defended his administration's handling of the Elian
Gonzalez case,though he expressed regret about how events in the
case unfolded, saying he wished the matter had been handled in a
``less dramatic, less traumatic way for all concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted the best solution to lowering gasoline prices
was a ``long-term strategy'' to promote conservation and
alternative sources of energy. ``We also need a home heating oil
reserve for the Northeast,'' he said. He said pump prices in the
hard-hit Midwest had fallen by 8 cents a gallon since the Federal
Trade Commission began its investigation into oil pricing, and the
probe signaled to the oil industry, ``we're running a serious
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   On the death penalty, Clinton said he believed there should be
the broadest possible use of DNA evidence and adequate access to
counsel for the defendant to ensure that only the guilty are
executed. ``Those of us who support the death penalty have an
extra-heavy responsibility to assure both that the result is
accurate and that the process was fair and constitutional,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton let out a hearty laugh when asked whether Bush possessed
the intelligence to be president. ``That's a dead-bang loser, isn't
it?'' he said. ``No matter what I say, I'm in a big hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Without offering an opinion on Bush, he said, ``The best is a
president that has had broad experience and that knows a lot and
that is curious.''
</P>
<P>
   But he showed no such hesitation in talking about Gore's
qualifications and defending the vice president's lagging poll
numbers against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has ever done as much for America as vice president as
Al Gore has,'' Clinton said. Once voters know that, ``it's still
more likely than not that he will win,'' he said, despite the
``volatility'' of today's polls.
</P>
<P>
   And he defended Gore against calls for Attorney General Janet
Reno to appoint a special prosecutor to investigative Gore's
statements regarding fund-raising in the 1996 campaign. ``The only
thing, as far as I know that he's been in any way implicated in is
this finance campaign thing,'' Clinton said, adding that Gore had
``certainly demonstrated that a lot of the accusations against him
with regard to that are not so.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said there was no evidence in the polls to suggest
voters were holding his administration's problems against Gore.
``Secondly, let me remind you that a lot of these other so-called
scandals were bogus.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the independent counsel probes of the Whitewater land
deal involving him and the first lady and those involving former
Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros, who was accused of lying about a
payment to his mistress, and former Agricultural Secretary Mike
Espy, who was accused of accepting gifts from a company his agency
regulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Espy was acquitted. The Cisneros thing was a tempest in a
teapot, totally overdone. And you all know that the Whitewater
thing was bogus from day one. It had nothing to do with the
official conduct of the administration anyway,'' Clinton said.
``The word `scandal' has been thrown around here like a clanging
teapot for seven years, and I keep waiting for somebody to say ...
that a whole bunch of this stuff was just garbage.''

AS ELIAN FLIES OFF, MIAMI CUBANS ARE DISTRAUGHT AND ANGRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CUBAN-BOY) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As a jet rumbled down a runway in Washington, bound for
Havana, Cuban exiles in Miami sank to their knees to pray for Elian
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the house in the Little Havana neighborhood where Elian
lived with his Miami relatives during the bulk of the international
custody battle that drew the attention of the world, an old woman
with white hair clutched a rosary and mumbled through tears that
slipped down her cheeks and onto her lips.
</P>
<P>
   Young men shouted and shook their fists and old men spoke
bitterly of the slavery that the boy is being delivered unto, as a
few people watched the plane's progress intently on a small,
portable television.
</P>
<P>
   They hunched in close to it, as if they could somehow will it to
stop, to turn around.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the jet's wheels cleared the runway, people here cried,
``No! No! No!'' until the plane climbed into the clouds, until it
was clear that, at last, the struggle was lost and the child they
held as a miracle, as a symbol of freedom and victory over
communism, was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Saul Sanchez, the unofficial leader of street protests to
keep Elian here in the United States, wept quietly as the plane
vanished from the television screen, and _ after seven months of
speeches and countless press interviews _ did not say a word.
</P>
<P>
   People tried to hand portable telephones to him, but he brushed
them away. ``We will not abandon Elian, even when he is returned to
Cuba,'' he had said, just before the boy, his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, and other family members and friends from Cuba began
boarding the planes that would ferry them home.
</P>
<P>
   But though Elian would be, three hours later, only a narrow
stretch of ocean away, it was as if he was ripped, again, from the
embrace of people here in Miami's exile community.
</P>
<P>
   They had been drawn to him since he arrived in South Florida on
Thanksgiving Day, one of three survivors of a failed crossing from
Cuba that drowned his mother and 10 others.
</P>
<P>
   ``My soul has been broken,'' said Rosaris Quinones, 17, a
student at Coral Reef High School. ``I've watched that little boy
play here. I believe he knows where he's going. I believe he knows
he's going to a bad place. It's such a nightmare. I still can't
believe it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time they lost Elian was on April 22, when armed
federal agents, acting on the orders of Attorney General Janet
Reno, crashed into the house and took the boy at gunpoint from his
relatives here, touching off a day of street protests, vandalism
and violent clashes with police. Thousands filled the streets and
clogged the roads, honking and singing.
</P>
<P>
   But that time, court injunctions and a series of appeals left
Cuban exiles here with some hope that the boy would be returned to
his Miami relatives, even though everyone except for the relatives,
their lawyers and others in their camp warned that it was highly
unlikely that Elian would be taken from his father and returned to
them.
</P>
<P>
   This time, there was no hope. Only about 50 people came to
protest, a tiny fraction of the number that had gathered to
demonstrate against the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel betrayed,'' said Maruchy Lachance, an Internet
researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great uncle, and Lazaro's daughter,
Marisleysis Gonzalez, had been on television almost every day for
months, as the saga wore on. But when approached by a television
cameraman outside Our Lady of Charity Church in Coconut Grove on
Wednesday, Lazaro Gonzalez angrily demanded that the cameraman
``shut it off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are devastated that at this very moment Elian will go back
to live in a country where he'll never be free, where his father
would simply not be allowed to give him the freedom that his mother
wanted so desperately, and died for,'' said Armando Gutierrez, the
spokesman for the boy's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In Tallahassee, Gov. Jeb Bush said the case had been
``mishandled from the very beginning'' and should have been settled
in a family court. For seven months, federal judges have found that
family courts _ state courts _ have no jurisdiction in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the Little Havana house, which has always seemed to
draw the most passionate responses to the Elian saga,
Cuban-Americans said they had resigned themselves long ago to the
inevitable, and saw no reason to become emotional now.
</P>
<P>
   But outside the house, Cuban exiles blamed the U.S. government
for caving in to the hated Fidel Castro, accusing the federal
courts of corruption, and saying they had lost all faith in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this country punishes all those who violate laws, why
doesn't it punish itself?'' said Frank Basque, 42, a veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said he is planning a flotilla to Cuba in two weeks, in
protest. But for many people here, the Elian saga is over.

  Hospitality beckons from the Dingle Peninsula

The Blasket Islands are the peninsula's most famous attraction,
located three miles off Dunmore Head, Ireland's westernmost point.
The largest of the group, the Great Blasket Island, was home in the
1920s and '30s to a thriving literary community that produced some
of Ireland's best-loved works.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO &QL; 
GETTING THERE: Ireland isn't a big country, so your best (and most
cost-effective) bet is to fly into Dublin and rent a car. If you're
going in the summer, make sure you make reservations well in
advance. And go with a manual transmission; cars with automatic
transmissions cost two to three times as much to rent because of
their relative scarcity.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: Doyle's Townhouse, 5 John St., Dingle. Phone: (800)
223-6510 or (011) 353-66-9151174. Rooms are available in the
three-story main guest house as well as an annex a short walk up
John Street. Rates, depending on the strength of the dollar, come
to about $125 a night for two people. The suites at the annex are
lovely, featuring a downstairs sitting area and comfortable
sleeping quarters upstairs. Prices include full breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: If you stayed at Doyle's and enjoyed the full Irish
breakfast, you won't be all that hungry until dinner. Stave off any
midday hunger pains with a pub lunch, which is uniformly decent.
And, since the area has no shortage of choices, you won't have any
trouble locating a place that serves sandwiches, soups and, yes,
the obligatory fish and chips. Returning to town, have dinner at
Doyle's, enjoying whatever fresh seafood is on the menu that day.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: For general tourist information on Ireland, call
(800) 223-6470. Web: www.irelandvacations.com. The tourist office
in Killarney can provide specific information on the Dingle
Peninsula. Phone: (011) 353-6431633. &QL;

Staff Writer &QL; 
DINGLE, Ireland _ When most people visit Ireland, they arrive in
Dublin and spend a few days immersed in the city's cosmopolitan
conviviality. Then, once the head has cleared from the immersion of
one too many nights spent in the city's Temple Bar pub district,
they decide to venture out into the real Ireland, the Emerald Isle
of rolling hills, rocky coastlines and a hundred shades of green.
</P>
<P>
   The question confronting the visitor at this point is: Where to
go? From the guidebooks and the travel planners, you're going to
hear a lot of noise about the sunny Southeast, a fair amount of
blarney about the Cork region and high praise for Limerick (usually
coming from people who regard Frank McCourt's works as the second
coming of the Book of Kells). Galway, Killarney and the Lower
Shannon region? All have their advocates, too, and quite
justifiably so.
</P>
<P>
   One place you're not going to hear too much about is the Dingle
Peninsula, which is Reason No. 1 you should go there. Here in
southwestern Ireland, you won't find any tacky souvenir shops
selling leprechaun figures, shamrocks and post cards picturing the
seven-course Irish dinner (it's a six-pack of Guinness and a
potato, for those who've never heard the old joke). You won't find
long lines of people waiting to kiss a stone or tour a brewery for
a free pint of beer. You won't find long lines of people, period _
just the most spectacular scenery anywhere in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Dingle's biggest tourist attraction _ a playful bottle-nose
dolphin named Fungie, who has made the harbor town his home since
1984 _ tells you a lot about the place. This is Ireland at its most
charming, a town with 1,200 residents and 52 pubs, which means
there's plenty of room for anyone looking for an enjoyable evening
out.
</P>
<P>
   Music and conversation are treasured. An expression of praise on
the peninsula _ which still has a fair number of Gaelic-speaking
residents _ is ``Mo cheol thu.'' Translation: ``You are my music.''
(Maybe that's where Barry Manilow cribbed the idea for ``I Write
the Songs''; if so, don't hold that against these dear people.)
</P>
<P>
   In Gaelic, Dingle means ``fortress,'' appropriate enough given
how the town is sheltered by the mountains on one side and the
Atlantic on the other. During medieval times, Dingle was the
primary harbor for County Kerry. Now it's a thriving fishing port,
and many of the anglers earn a decent living taking tourists on bay
excursions to see the mischievous Fungie. At any one time, there
might be six ships in the harbor whose sole purpose is to coax the
dolphin into view. (The voyages also provide you with a great view
of the bay, the surrounding hills and the occasional castle ruin.)
</P>
<P>
   The boats' motion is all Fungie usually needs to appear. He'll
often follow a fishing vessel during its entire seaward or homeward
voyage. Sometimes, though, when he's being a little coy, sightseers
will try almost anything to lure him to the surface. One boy
dangled a candy bar from the side of the boat, pleading, ``C'mon
Fungie, c'mon! I've got a Mars bar fer ye if you'll just show
yerself!''
</P>
<P>
   The other wonders of the region are never hidden. National
Geographic magazine called the Dingle Peninsula ``the most
beautiful place on Earth,'' which is certainly open to debate, but
no visitor will question the grandeur of its visual pleasures. This
is the isolated part of Ireland where the 1970 melodrama ``Ryan's
Daughter'' was shot. The film won an Oscar for its cinematography,
which probably had more to do with the dramatic scenery than any
filmmaking prowess.
</P>
<P>
   The peninsula reaches about 40 miles out to sea, making it the
westernmost part of Ireland (and of Europe, for that matter). If
you wanted to drive the entire area, you'd have a little more than
100 miles to traverse and, given the windy roads and the number of
stops you'd undoubtedly want to make, the trip would require the
better part of the day. Starting from Dingle, however, you can
reduce the loop to 25 miles, making it a half-day excursion. This
leaves you with more time to explore the town, not to mention those
52 pubs.
</P>
<P>
   The rugged Dingle Peninsula isn't as heavily traveled as
Ireland's famed Ring of Kerry, which is the region just south of
Dingle. This seclusion gives the land an almost otherworldly sense
of calm and peacefulness. The views are spectacular. The verdant
hills dotted with sheep, the turquoise water and the white sands
combine to produce a compelling array of colors that pleases the
eye and soothes the mind. This is land that cries out for
contemplation, and its isolation affords visitors that opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such contemplation can be difficult when driving
roads barely wide enough for your compact rental car, never mind
the oncoming traffic. Winding around the tight curves of Route 559
can be an alarming experience for anyone not used to driving narrow
lanes bracketed by stone walls (the brightly blooming fuchsia
plants nicely disguise the barriers in the summer). There's also
the fact that if you're an American, you're motoring on the
``wrong'' side of the road. But with roads this constricted, you
can throw the concept of ``sides'' out the window. Whoever hits the
bend first has the right of way.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, even during the height of tourist season, you'll
probably never run into another car _ and that is meant both in the
literal and figurative sense. So the rules of the road, while
important, aren't exactly going to be paramount here. And that's
even taking into account all the neck-craning you'll be doing.
</P>
<P>
   The peninsula's most famous scenic attractions are the seven
Blasket Islands, located three miles off Dunmore Head, Ireland's
westernmost point. The largest of the group, the Great Blasket
Island, was home in the 1920s and '30s to a thriving literary
community that produced some of Ireland's best-loved works.
Emigration and the harshness of the remote island life caused the
population to dwindle to the point where it was abandoned in 1953
when only 22 inhabitants remained. Ferries still take visitors to
the Great Blasket, and the Blasket Centre, located just north of
Dunmore Head, provides guided tours and historical exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Other celebrated sites can be reached a little more easily, such
as the Dunbeg Fort, a well-preserved Iron Age stronghold that
dramatically overlooks the Atlantic. Nearby, in the hills along
Slea Head Road, sit dozens of beehive huts that date back to the
12th century. Then, the Irish used the drystone, corbelled
dwellings as homes after the Normans had driven them from the prime
real estate; as recently as a century ago, the huts remained in use
for storage purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The nearby Gallarus Oratory, a miniature Christian church built
some time between the sixth and ninth centuries, is also worth a
look. Shaped like an upturned boat, this place, like the peninsula
itself, remains a haven for quiet reflection.
</P>
<P>
   Children, though, have never been too big on quiet reflection,
so anyone with kids might also want to mix in a trip or two to the
peninsula's many family-friendly attractions. There's the Enchanted
Forest, a fairy-tale museum with its own pub (naturally) and
Farmworld, a wildlife petting zoo featuring Angora goats, Galway
lambs and assorted rare Irish animal breeds. Scanlon's Pet Farm is
another like-minded conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the harbor, near Fungie territory, is the Oceanworld
Aquarium, a sea sanctuary spotlighting the sea culture of the
region, along with artifacts from the Spanish Armada and St.
Brendan the Navigator's Atlantic voyages. None of these places
remotely resembles Disneyland, but then there are fewer people,
better food and no price gouging here. And Disneyland doesn't have
Guinness on draft for the adults, either.
</P>
<P>
   That latter distinction is an important one. Contemplating
natural wonders and playful dolphins may be good for the soul, but
the stomach has its needs, too. Fortunately, Irish cuisine has come
a long way since the days when overcooked meats and vegetables and
a profusion of potatoes frightened visitors into adopting a steady
diet of fish and chips. Dingle, being a thriving seaport, is a
seafood lover's paradise, with several excellent restaurants
offering fresh fish straight from the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the lot is Doyle's Seafood Bar, located on John
Street, right in the center of this lovely little town. Everything
here is fresh, either straight off the boat or from a neighboring
farm or from Stella Doyle's backyard garden.
</P>
<P>
   Owners John and Stella also smoke their own salmon, which is
excellent, as is poached lobster, grilled mussels with garlic, and
a fisherman's pie, with chunks of fresh seafood combined with a
creamy sauce served in a pastry crust. (Note for fish haters: The
lamb and steaks are great, too. Vegetarians, though, might want to
pick a different country to visit.)
</P>
<P>
   The town comes alive at night, particularly in the summer, with
pubs such as An Droichead Beag (The Small Bridge), Mac Carthaigh's,
Flaherty's and An Chonair all featuring singing, dancing and lively
traditional music. Being a tourist doesn't matter in the least when
it comes to participating; the Irish aren't exactly standoffish
when it comes to welcoming guests. You may, however, wish to
observe a jig or two before wheeling yourself out to the dance
floor, particularly if you've had a pint or two.
</P>
<P>
   But then, everyone else in the place has enjoyed a pint or two
as well, and, anyway, no one is keeping score on how much you've
drunk or how well you dance. A little too much enthusiasm in either
arena will just make for some good ``craic,'' which, translated
from the Gaelic, means either ``good conversation'' or ``wud yeh
look at tha' fool oveh ther.''
</P>
<P>
   Always remember, though, they're laughing with you, not at you.
You'll be laughing, too, because you'll be having the time of your
life.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget to bring a Mars bar for Fungie. &QL;

The Blasket Islands are the peninsula's most famous attraction,
located three miles off Dunmore Head, Ireland's westernmost point.
The largest of the group, the Great Blasket Island, was home in the
1920s and '30s to a thriving literary community that produced some
of Ireland's best-loved works.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO &QL; 
GETTING THERE: Ireland isn't a big country, so your best (and most
cost-effective) bet is to fly into Dublin and rent a car. If you're
going in the summer, make sure you make reservations well in
advance. And go with a manual transmission; cars with automatic
transmissions cost two to three times as much to rent because of
their relative scarcity.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: Doyle's Townhouse, 5 John St., Dingle. Phone: (800)
223-6510 or (011) 353-66-9151174. Rooms are available in the
three-story main guest house as well as an annex a short walk up
John Street. Rates, depending on the strength of the dollar, come
to about $125 a night for two people. The suites at the annex are
lovely, featuring a downstairs sitting area and comfortable
sleeping quarters upstairs. Prices include full breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: If you stayed at Doyle's and enjoyed the full Irish
breakfast, you won't be all that hungry until dinner. Stave off any
midday hunger pains with a pub lunch, which is uniformly decent.
And, since the area has no shortage of choices, you won't have any
trouble locating a place that serves sandwiches, soups and, yes,
the obligatory fish and chips. Returning to town, have dinner at
Doyle's, enjoying whatever fresh seafood is on the menu that day.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: For general tourist information on Ireland, call

Staff Writer &QL; 
DINGLE, Ireland _ When most people visit Ireland, they arrive in
Dublin and spend a few days immersed in the city's cosmopolitan
conviviality. Then, once the head has cleared from the immersion of
one too many nights spent in the city's Temple Bar pub district,
they decide to venture out into the real Ireland, the Emerald Isle
of rolling hills, rocky coastlines and a hundred shades of green.
</P>
<P>
   The question confronting the visitor at this point is: Where to
go? From the guidebooks and the travel planners, you're going to
hear a lot of noise about the sunny Southeast, a fair amount of
blarney about the Cork region and high praise for Limerick (usually
coming from people who regard Frank McCourt's works as the second
coming of the Book of Kells). Galway, Killarney and the Lower
Shannon region? All have their advocates, too, and quite
justifiably so.
</P>
<P>
   One place you're not going to hear too much about is the Dingle
Peninsula, which is Reason No. 1 you should go there. Here in
southwestern Ireland, you won't find any tacky souvenir shops
selling leprechaun figures, shamrocks and post cards picturing the
seven-course Irish dinner (it's a six-pack of Guinness and a
potato, for those who've never heard the old joke). You won't find
long lines of people waiting to kiss a stone or tour a brewery for
a free pint of beer. You won't find long lines of people, period _
just the most spectacular scenery anywhere in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Dingle's biggest tourist attraction _ a playful bottle-nose
dolphin named Fungie, who has made the harbor town his home since
1984 _ tells you a lot about the place. This is Ireland at its most
charming, a town with 1,200 residents and 52 pubs, which means
there's plenty of room for anyone looking for an enjoyable evening
out.
</P>
<P>
   Music and conversation are treasured. An expression of praise on
the peninsula _ which still has a fair number of Gaelic-speaking
residents _ is ``Mo cheol thu.'' Translation: ``You are my music.''
(Maybe that's where Barry Manilow cribbed the idea for ``I Write
the Songs''; if so, don't hold that against these dear people.)
</P>
<P>
   In Gaelic, Dingle means ``fortress,'' appropriate enough given
how the town is sheltered by the mountains on one side and the
Atlantic on the other. During medieval times, Dingle was the
primary harbor for County Kerry. Now it's a thriving fishing port,
and many of the anglers earn a decent living taking tourists on bay
excursions to see the mischievous Fungie. At any one time, there
might be six ships in the harbor whose sole purpose is to coax the
dolphin into view. (The voyages also provide you with a great view
of the bay, the surrounding hills and the occasional castle ruin.)
</P>
<P>
   The boats' motion is all Fungie usually needs to appear. He'll
often follow a fishing vessel during its entire seaward or homeward
voyage. Sometimes, though, when he's being a little coy, sightseers
will try almost anything to lure him to the surface. One boy
dangled a candy bar from the side of the boat, pleading, ``C'mon
Fungie, c'mon! I've got a Mars bar fer ye if you'll just show
yerself!''
</P>
<P>
   The other wonders of the region are never hidden. National
Geographic magazine called the Dingle Peninsula ``the most
beautiful place on Earth,'' which is certainly open to debate, but
no visitor will question the grandeur of its visual pleasures. This
is the isolated part of Ireland where the 1970 melodrama ``Ryan's
Daughter'' was shot. The film won an Oscar for its cinematography,
which probably had more to do with the dramatic scenery than any
filmmaking prowess.
</P>
<P>
   The peninsula reaches about 40 miles out to sea, making it the
westernmost part of Ireland (and of Europe, for that matter). If
you wanted to drive the entire area, you'd have a little more than
100 miles to traverse and, given the windy roads and the number of
stops you'd undoubtedly want to make, the trip would require the
better part of the day. Starting from Dingle, however, you can
reduce the loop to 25 miles, making it a half-day excursion. This
leaves you with more time to explore the town, not to mention those
52 pubs.
</P>
<P>
   The rugged Dingle Peninsula isn't as heavily traveled as
Ireland's famed Ring of Kerry, which is the region just south of
Dingle. This seclusion gives the land an almost otherworldly sense
of calm and peacefulness. The views are spectacular. The verdant
hills dotted with sheep, the turquoise water and the white sands
combine to produce a compelling array of colors that pleases the
eye and soothes the mind. This is land that cries out for
contemplation, and its isolation affords visitors that opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such contemplation can be difficult when driving
roads barely wide enough for your compact rental car, never mind
the oncoming traffic. Winding around the tight curves of Route 559
can be an alarming experience for anyone not used to driving narrow
lanes bracketed by stone walls (the brightly blooming fuchsia
plants nicely disguise the barriers in the summer). There's also
the fact that if you're an American, you're motoring on the
``wrong'' side of the road. But with roads this constricted, you
can throw the concept of ``sides'' out the window. Whoever hits the
bend first has the right of way.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, even during the height of tourist season, you'll
probably never run into another car _ and that is meant both in the
literal and figurative sense. So the rules of the road, while
important, aren't exactly going to be paramount here. And that's
even taking into account all the neck-craning you'll be doing.
</P>
<P>
   The peninsula's most famous scenic attractions are the seven
Blasket Islands, located three miles off Dunmore Head, Ireland's
westernmost point. The largest of the group, the Great Blasket
Island, was home in the 1920s and '30s to a thriving literary
community that produced some of Ireland's best-loved works.
Emigration and the harshness of the remote island life caused the
population to dwindle to the point where it was abandoned in 1953
when only 22 inhabitants remained. Ferries still take visitors to
the Great Blasket, and the Blasket Centre, located just north of
Dunmore Head, provides guided tours and historical exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Other celebrated sites can be reached a little more easily, such
as the Dunbeg Fort, a well-preserved Iron Age stronghold that
dramatically overlooks the Atlantic. Nearby, in the hills along
Slea Head Road, sit dozens of beehive huts that date back to the
12th century. Then, the Irish used the drystone, corbelled
dwellings as homes after the Normans had driven them from the prime
real estate; as recently as a century ago, the huts remained in use
for storage purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The nearby Gallarus Oratory, a miniature Christian church built
some time between the sixth and ninth centuries, is also worth a
look. Shaped like an upturned boat, this place, like the peninsula
itself, remains a haven for quiet reflection.
</P>
<P>
   Children, though, have never been too big on quiet reflection,
so anyone with kids might also want to mix in a trip or two to the
peninsula's many family-friendly attractions. There's the Enchanted
Forest, a fairy-tale museum with its own pub (naturally) and
Farmworld, a wildlife petting zoo featuring Angora goats, Galway
lambs and assorted rare Irish animal breeds. Scanlon's Pet Farm is
another like-minded conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the harbor, near Fungie territory, is the Oceanworld
Aquarium, a sea sanctuary spotlighting the sea culture of the
region, along with artifacts from the Spanish Armada and St.
Brendan the Navigator's Atlantic voyages. None of these places
remotely resembles Disneyland, but then there are fewer people,
better food and no price gouging here. And Disneyland doesn't have
Guinness on draft for the adults, either.
</P>
<P>
   That latter distinction is an important one. Contemplating
natural wonders and playful dolphins may be good for the soul, but
the stomach has its needs, too. Fortunately, Irish cuisine has come
a long way since the days when overcooked meats and vegetables and
a profusion of potatoes frightened visitors into adopting a steady
diet of fish and chips. Dingle, being a thriving seaport, is a
seafood lover's paradise, with several excellent restaurants
offering fresh fish straight from the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the lot is Doyle's Seafood Bar, located on John
Street, right in the center of this lovely little town. Everything
here is fresh, either straight off the boat or from a neighboring
farm or from Stella Doyle's backyard garden.
</P>
<P>
   Owners John and Stella also smoke their own salmon, which is
excellent, as is poached lobster, grilled mussels with garlic, and
a fisherman's pie, with chunks of fresh seafood combined with a
creamy sauce served in a pastry crust. (Note for fish haters: The
lamb and steaks are great, too. Vegetarians, though, might want to
pick a different country to visit.)
</P>
<P>
   The town comes alive at night, particularly in the summer, with
pubs such as An Droichead Beag (The Small Bridge), Mac Carthaigh's,
Flaherty's and An Chonair all featuring singing, dancing and lively
traditional music. Being a tourist doesn't matter in the least when
it comes to participating; the Irish aren't exactly standoffish
when it comes to welcoming guests. You may, however, wish to
observe a jig or two before wheeling yourself out to the dance
floor, particularly if you've had a pint or two.
</P>
<P>
   But then, everyone else in the place has enjoyed a pint or two
as well, and, anyway, no one is keeping score on how much you've
drunk or how well you dance. A little too much enthusiasm in either
arena will just make for some good ``craic,'' which, translated
from the Gaelic, means either ``good conversation'' or ``wud yeh
look at tha' fool oveh ther.''
</P>
<P>
   Always remember, though, they're laughing with you, not at you.
You'll be laughing, too, because you'll be having the time of your
life.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget to bring a Mars bar for Fungie. &QL;

DEPLETED OPPOSITION IN BELARUS SEARCHES FOR A NEW LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINSK, Belarus _ For months, Ivan Misko scraped, spackled and
molded until he had properly endowed his bust of Gennady Karpenko
with the mountainous brow of a scholar, the sturdy jaw of a leader
and, above all, the forward gaze of a charismatic politician
peering into the Belarussian future.
</P>
<P>
   As a devoted friend to the late Karpenko, a physicist and
politician, Misko this spring cast his work in plaster and
supervised its transformation into bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is almost ready for unveiling at Karpenko's tomb, a
ceremony that when it takes place sometime in July will be a
significant political act in this authoritarian state that lies
between Russia and the West.
</P>
<P>
   For Karpenko was, until his death on April 6, 1999, one of the
most dangerous men in Belarus as the leader of the opposition
forces seeking to oust President Aleksandr Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
   Karpenko, a deputy speaker of the Parliament disbanded by
Lukashenko in 1996, died abruptly at age 49 of what the medical
authorities here said was a brain hemorrhage. Though there is no
proof of foul play, the circumstances surrounding Karpenko's final
hours _ he received no serious medical attention for 24 hours after
he collapsed and entered a state medical center _ have caused his
family to doubt that he died of natural causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning I suspected that he was murdered
somehow,'' said his wife, Lyudmila. ``And when other opposition
leaders started disappearing months later, it confirmed my
suspicions.''
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture of respect for Karpenko's advocacy of democracy,
the U.S. ambassador, Daniel Speckhard, made a private visit to the
grave site last year accompanied by his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Since the funeral, the pressure on the family has not eased.
Karpenko's son, Dimitri, has been driven from his job in a state
enterprise, and his family remains under surveillance and
harassment from Lukashenko's security forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid for my children,'' Lyudmila Karpenko said. ``They
don't have a future in this country. We are going to open the
monument to Gennady, and then we are going to leave the country. It
is just too hard to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   As a state artist of the Soviet Union, Misko spent much of his
life lionizing astronauts and other heroes of socialist labor. His
studio, at the edge of a leafy courtyard near the center of the
capital, is an untidy museum of the socialist realism that
flourished under Communism, and that Stalin saw as the best means
to bend art to the service of the totalitarian state. It became
state policy in 1932, the year Misko was born.
</P>
<P>
   A barrel-chested sculptor who chiseled President Clinton's
profile on a commemorative medallion for his visit here in 1994,
Misko would be the last person to say he is engaging in politics
with his art. But the Karpenko bust is unmistakably an act of
rebellion against the authoritarianism that exists under
Lukashenko, an admirer of Stalin and the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am doing it for free,'' said Misko, whose shock of white
hair and mischievous eyes always seem to convey more than he says.
``I am not doing it for money _ in fact, no one wants to pay for
it. The family does not have the money, and there is no one else to
place the order, especially not the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my friend for a long time,'' Misko said of Karpenko.
</P>
<P>
   As the bronze was being cast last week, the visage of Karpenko
in clay still dominated Misko's studio, capturing what friends say
was the quiet resolve of the man who unified the country's
opposition parties little more than a year ago, and prepared them
to stage a mock presidential election that challenged Lukashenko's
legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko's presidential term expired last July, though he
continues to rule after rewriting the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The unveiling of the Karpenko memorial is scheduled for sometime
after the Congress of Democratic Forces, a grouping of opposition
parties, convenes on July 2 here in the capital. Unless Lukashenko
bans it, the congress aims once again to unite all opposition
parties in a new challenge to the president.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The congress, its organizers say, will demand fair elections
this fall for a new Parliament and next year for a new president,
and it will insist that Lukashenko re-establish the rule of
parliamentary law that has been replaced in recent years by
presidential decrees.
</P>
<P>
   Were Karpenko still alive, he would certainly have been the
leading candidate to challenge Lukashenko, in the view of most
political analysts here. Karpenko would have been able to unite the
opposition, but without him the opposition cannot offer a broadly
acceptable leader, said Yevgeny Ogurtsov, a member of the United
Civic Party and an editor whose newspaper, The Citizen, was shut
down by Lukashenko in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Karpenko's death was deeply disturbing to many
here, and in the months that followed, Belarussians were all the
more stunned by the assault on most of the remaining opposition
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the political landscape has been wiped clean,
says Irina Khalip, an independent journalist who has been arrested
and harassed for her coverage of corruption and political abuse
under Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
   ``All political leaders who might have laid claim to the
presidency have either died under suspicious circumstances, like
Karpenko, or they have fled in fear of their lives or
disappeared,'' she said. ``The remaining ones have been convicted
of political crimes with conditions that they cannot participate in
the elections, and so today there is almost no opposition figure
who could run against Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevertheless,'' Khalip added, ``it is a big mistake for
Lukashenko to feel safe, because a new leader will appear.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Karpenko did.

 &HT;    Usually blase' Big Apple riveted by Rocker's return to city
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York _ Say what you want about John Rocker, the
controversial Braves pitcher who pretty much says whatever he
wants.
</P>
<P>
   Call him a loudmouth. Say his fastball's been as unpredictably
loopy as his recent behavior. Even mock him for looking ``like
Bullwinkle when he runs,'' as one Mets fan did Tuesday night at
Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But don't for one moment suggest that this city that supposedly
has seen it all _ twice _ isn't utterly and completely obsessed
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore was appearing over at the ABC studios the other day,
and there was nobody there waiting to see him, but here we all are
talking about John Rocker, who's somewhere up in Canada right
now,'' Izzy Orloff practically moaned on a midtown Manhattan
sidewalk Tuesday afternoon. ``Who's more important, the vice
president or John Rocker?''
</P>
<P>
   Important, nuthin', as they say in New York. What matters more
is that Rocker's on everybody's radar screen here as tonight's
showdown series with the Mets begins. He also is on theater
marquees (``John Rocker Stay Home!'' was the message outside one
establishment near Times Square the other day), on newspaper front
pages and local TV news (``When `Live At Five' continues, `The
Rocker Report!''' the NBC affiliate's anchor boomed Tuesday) and on
virtually everyone's lips.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they claim to be heartily sick of this whole
controversy, sparked by Rocker's derogatory comments about New York
and its inhabitants in a Sports Illustrated article last December.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a news creation, a media thing,'' griped Jim Kupcho
of nearby Woodbridge, N.J., who was strolling in Central Park.
Then, Kupcho spent the next 10 minutes analyzing the Rocker
situation from every angle.
</P>
<P>
   And even when they're not exactly sure what to make of the guy.
Whereas New York City Police Commissioner Howard Safir has likened
guarding Rocker this weekend to ``protecting the Ku Klux Klan,''
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has said the issue of the big lefty's
security is being treated ``as if it were a head of state coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach might sound schizophrenic, but it actually is
pretty simple: more cops, less booze. As many as 700 New York
police officers could be deployed to Shea, Giuliani said; that
number is more than 10 times for a normal regular-season game. And
the Mets are erecting a plywood roof over the visiting bullpen to
protect Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   A shadowy group of fans has designated Friday's game as
``Battery Night,'' a reference to what they want people to bring to
fling at the Braves reliever; meanwhile, a sporting goods store
near Shea is hawking hard hats in Mets' orange and blue and
emblazoned with ``Don't Hit Me, I'm Not John Rocker.''
</P>
<P>
   A check with several dozen fans at Tuesday's game turned up no
one planning to throw batteries themselves; but everyone at least
knew someone who knew someone who supposedly would be packing size
D's at Shea. The extra security alone is estimated to cost the city
several hundred thousand dollars. Some taxpayers here are pretty
steamed about that, including Mets reliever and Queens resident
John Franco.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not half as steamed as Shea Stadium regulars are
about a plan to limit beer consumption. During Tuesday night's game
against the Florida Marlins, normal policy was in place, and adult
fans could buy as many as four beers at once. During the Braves
series they will be able to buy only two beers at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to reduce the tension level in the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone got any other good ideas?
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, now I'm mad,'' Brooklyn resident Joseph Iovelli said as he
headed into Shea on Tuesday. ``You can come in here and say New
York is a cesspool, that all Mets fans are morons, and that's one
thing. But don't come in here and affect how many beers I can buy!
That's when I really start to hate John Rocker!''
</P>
<P>
   Iovelli had taken the No. 7 subway to Shea, the same train
derided by Rocker in December as being full of criminals,
foreigners and ``some kid with purple hair, next to some queer with
AIDS.'' On this particular Tuesday, the train's passengers included
one tattooed, spiky-haired kid with a nickel-sized hole pierced in
his ear, lots of people speaking foreign languages and dozens of
Mets fans speculating on whether Rocker really would make good on
his pledge to ride the No. 7 to tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   For days, Giuliani and others have begged him not to do it.
Meanwhile, the police have drawn up plans to surround him with nine
officers and turn his train into an express making only a few stops
instead of the usual 21from midtown Manhattan to Shea. Yet one more
reason for the average New Yorker to despise Rocker, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd sure like to be able to summon an express train whenever I
need one,'' Angela Harrison grumbled Wednesday morning, weaving
through the throngs to make a transfer inside the vast Times Square
subway station. ``What's this guy's power, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, it's having a strange effect on New York, a
usually cocky city that, for once, seems a little bit unsure of
itself - or how to behave around Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   One group of fans, noting his comment last week that booing
inspires him to pitch better, is urging everyone to stand and
silently turn their backs on Rocker when he enters games this
weekend. But others want nothing to do with such dignified
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is New York,'' Elliot Auerbacher snorted on his cellular
telephone. Auerbacher, who started the Web site
www.rockersucks.com, was doing a brisk business selling his
anti-Rocker T-shirts earlier this week near Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York style is not to politely turn your back on
someone,'' he said. ``It's to get in your face and say, `We don't
like you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But it's also the New York style to attract lots of attention to
oneself. Whatever else happens this weekend, a lot of people here
say, John Rocker already has pretty much beaten this city at its
own game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must be loving this,'' Iovelli, the Mets fan from Brooklyn,
said Tuesday night as he continued his trek from the subway stop
into Shea. ``'Cause we hate him and we're all bending over
backwards for him.''

ROCKER'S RIDE ON THE NO. 7: A TOUR OF THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- Here's some news for John Rocker: It may be safer
for you to ride the Number 7 train to Shea Stadium than to take the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who ride the Number 7 or live along it are like
Balinder Kumar, owner of Neena Sari Palace of Queens: Too busy
making their way in America to pay attention to a ballplayer's view
of their right to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know nothing of what you talk about,'' Kumar says, when
asked about the relief pitcher and his famous contempt for the
city's immigrants and minorities. Nothing about Rocker? Baseball?
the Braves?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, nothing,'' he says. ``I have work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   So if Rocker really does ride the 7, he could safely get off at
a few stops along the route, look around, and discover it's a
pretty cheap way to tour the world.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker caused a stir last December in a Sports Illustrated
interview, when he compared the Number 7 to a ride through Beirut
and described its passengers as ``some kid with purple hair next to
some queer with AIDS right next to some dude who just got out of
jail for the fourth time right next to some 20-year-old with four
kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing I don't like about New York,'' he summed up,
``are the foreigners.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Braves in town to play the Mets Thursday, Rocker has
said he will pass up the team's bus ride out to Shea and _ against
the urgings of the mayor and the police _ take the 7 instead.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker is right about one thing: There are a lot of foreigners
riding the 7. What he probably does not know is that the Number 7
line forms the crest of the biggest and broadest wave of
immigration New York City has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   The wave forms right along the 7 line _ which starts at Times
Square, goes east to Grand Central, then cuts a swath through
northwestern Queens. Each station-stop is like a different country.
</P>
<P>
   Get out at 74th St. in Jackson Heights, and you're in some
fusion of India and Pakistan. Go one more stop, to 82nd St., and
it's Argentina and Colombia. The next three stops, at Corona,
you're in Mexico, with sidestreet views of Ecuador, Peru, and
Uruguay. Go to the end of the line in Flushing, one stop past Shea,
and it's China with a bit of Korea around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first stop for many immigrants,'' says Andrew
Beveridge, a sociologist at Queens College. ``100 years ago, the
first stop was the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Today, it's west
Queens.''
</P>
<P>
   And as they come, they settle along the Number 7 line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 7 line was built in the 1920s to redistribute the crowded
immigration populations from Manhattan,'' said Illona Harlow, who
studies these groups for the Queens Council on the Arts. ``It
continues to play the role today. It's close to the airports, and
it's a fast commute into the city where people work.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one big difference: today's immigrants are far more
diverse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1910, five countries _ Russia, Italy, Austria, Germany, and
Ireland _ provided three-quarters of this city's immigrants. Today,
you could add up the numbers from the top 25 countries and account
for just two-thirds of the immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 7.3 million people in New York City, over 2 million _
nearly one-third _ were born in other countries. Of the 600,000
people in western Queens, along the Number 7 line, over half are
foreign-born.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the story of 20th-century America will find
little new in these neighborhoods. Talk with Tomas Gonzalez, owner
of La Espiga bakery in Corona, and you hear echoes of the ambitions
of Italians, Greeks, or Jews who came to New York a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez came to Queens from Mexico in 1986, and sold tacos from
a pushcart on Roosevelt Avenue, just off the 7 line. He saved his
money, and when a Colombian bakery closed down a few blocks away,
took over the lease. Two years ago he expanded into a second
bakery, and gave the original to his son.
</P>
<P>
   The new La Espiga is a hang-out for many Mexicans in the
neighborhood. The jukebox plays popular tunes from back home. A
rooftop satellite-dish brings in TV Azteca. ``This Sunday,''
Gonzalez says, ``everybody will be in here, watching the Mexican
election returns.''
</P>
<P>
   This is another difference with the new immigrants. A century
ago, few could stay in touch with their homelands even if they
wanted to. Now there's satellite TV, airplanes, long-distance
calling-cards, newspapers in dozens of languages, and a cultural
environment that, far from pushing ``Americanization,'' celebrates
ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   The 74th Street stop, where Balinder Kumar has his sari shop,
might jar Rocker the most. While most of the 7's neighborhoods have
overlapping languages and nationalities, this stop is almost
monolithically Indo-Asian.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest Indian shopping district in America,''
Kumar says. ``Not just people who live here, but Indian, Pakistani,
and Bangladeshi people from all over the United States come here to
shop.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, those three peoples have fought wars against one
another. Here, signs on restaurants advertise
``Indian-Pakistani-Bangladeshi cuisine.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehmod Syed, deputy manager of the Habib American Bank, just
down the street, says, ``There are no politics here, just business.
I am Indian,'' then, pointing to another bank officer, ``he is
Pakistani. There are no problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Such assimilation of subcultures is common here. But more
striking is the sharp segregation of broad cultural groups into
station-stop continents.
</P>
<P>
   The Number 7 line explains this, too. It covers a vast stretch
of land; lots of groups have room to spread out. Yet the
station-stops provide natural points for clustering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's word of mouth,'' Syed explains. ``Someone from India
comes to this neighborhood. A relative back home joins him later.
Others follow, knowing the people here speak their language,
understand their culture.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how it has always worked. Groups grow, reach a
critical-mass, then scatter as they become successful. New groups
come and replace them.
</P>
<P>
   Here, even as the immigrant population soars in diversity and
number, the second stage of assimilation has already started _ the
move to the suburbs. But areas like Jackson Heights preserve the
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrant specialist Harlow once saw a woman on 74th Street
drive her car up to a pushcart selling kulfi, an Indian ice cream.
``She'd driven in from Long Island,'' Harlow remembers. ``She had
some ice in a big plastic bucket, and she filled the bucket with
kulfi for her kids. She grew up with kulfi back in India, and she
wanted her kids in the American suburbs to have this in their
childhoods, too.''

President Ronald Reagan and three others, has argued for years that
he should be permitted additional freedom, saying his mental health
has improved since he attempted the assassination to prove his
devotion to the actress Jodie Foster. The reversal by the hospital,
St. Elizabeths in Washington, followed court filings on Tuesday in

fueling a record-breaking $171 million holiday and causing swoons
of ecstasy to ripple through the corporate corridors of major movie
studios. After that, who knew what the rest of the summer of 2000
might bring? And then something happened. The horizon darkened. The
engine began to make a funny pinging sound. Slowly, silently, the
air went out of the tires. And the summer movie season of 2000
began to sink into the doldrums _ at least compared with last
year's. By Rick Lyman. (1600 words)

HOUSE INCUMBENT LOSES IN REPUBLICAN PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Texas, Va.)   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Scarcely two hours after the polls closed on
Tuesday night, Rep. Merrill Cook acknowledged the inevitable. His
turbulent four years representing Utah's 2nd Congressional District
had caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer than half the votes counted, Cook conceded to Derek
Smith, a business owner and political newcomer who went on to win
nearly 59 percent of the vote, making Cook the first Republican
incumbent to lose in a primary this year. One incumbent Democrat
has fallen, Rep. Matthew Martinez of California's 31st District,
who lost to state Sen. Hilda Solis.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Solis, who has no opponent in November, Smith will
face a formidable challenger, Jim Matheson, a political neophyte,
as well, but also the son of an immensely popular former governor,
the late Scott Matheson. With Democrats needing a swing of six
seats to regain the House majority they lost in 1994, this is one
seat they believe they have a strong chance to win back.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah's other major Republican primary on Tuesday, Gov.
Michael Leavitt withstood a spirited challenge from the right and
defeated Glen Davis with 61 percent of the vote. Leavitt, who is
seeking a third four-year term, will face Bill Orton, a former
Democratic congressman, in the general election, a contest that
could be competitive because of the high profiles of both
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The victory by Smith ended a seven-week campaign that turned
from nasty to nastier, reaching a climax of sorts on a Salt Lake
City street last Wednesday, when he and Cook stood for 45 minutes
arguing as reporters looked on.
</P>
<P>
   Their confrontation was a continuation of verbal assaults over
personal finances, voting habits and prospects for success in
November. Yet for Cook, it was just the latest chapter in a brief
congressional career that was never short of distractions. More
than for any notable legislation, he brought attention to himself
here and in Washington for public temper tantrums, staff turnover
and a recent trial in which a jury found that he had not paid a
former consultant almost $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief concession speech, Cook accused reporters of
blowing his past out of proportion and denounced the Republican
leadership in Washington for withholding full support, saying,
``You can't win when the party big shots won't stand up for you.''
And Wednesday, he expanded the blame to include Democrats who had
voted in the open primary solely to drive him out of office and
disgruntled former employees.
</P>
<P>
   He also broadened his criticism of party leaders, accusing them
of following ``two sets of rules, one for incumbents, one for
Merrill Cook.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, he did receive considerable help from many leading
Republicans. Speaker Dennis Hastert, and the House majority leader,
Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, and the majority whip, Rep. Tom DeLay of
Texas, all traveled to Utah to raise money for Cook.
</P>
<P>
   But some other House Republicans, including Rep. Christopher
Cannon, who represents Utah's 3rd Congressional District, supported
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, who became wealthy as the owner of an explosives company,
vowed that his political career would not end after November,
hinting that he might return as an independent, which he has done
before. In eight years as an independent before he won the
congressional seat, he ran twice for governor and once for mayor of
Salt Lake City, the congressional seat, the school board and the
Salt Lake County Commission _ losing all six times.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he was disheartened that so many Republican leaders
had backed Cook, which, he said, ``drove home a point: If you're
challenging an incumbent, you better be prepared to stand alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's their job,'' he added. ``If I'm the incumbent in
two years, I would expect them to support me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still wide-eyed after a sleepless night, much of it spent
celebrating, Smith said he felt relieved that he could now look
forward to a campaign against Matheson that he predicted would
focus more on issues than personality. He said a barrage of attacks
by Cook had forced him to spend time defending himself, rather than
discussing issues like education reform, tax cuts, job creation and
expanding voter participation through use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he was eager to bring stability to the seat, which
represents parts of Salt Lake City and several adjacent counties.
The winner in November will become the district's fifth
representative in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Rep. Thomas Davis III, chairman of the National
Republican Congressional Committee, said in a statement that the
party would now throw its full support behind Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad news is a Republican incumbent lost,'' Davis, of
Virginia, said. ``The good news is we have a strong nominee in this
seat for the fall. Merrill Cook has been a fine representative for
the citizens of Utah, working tirelessly on their behalf. His
presence will be missed here in Washington after November. I wish
him all the best, and I am confident he will join us in supporting
Derek Smith this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook said he would have to think about it.

MARKET PLACE: NYSE PENALIZES WELL-KNOWN ANALYST AND FIRM FOR FALSE
RUMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An analyst spreads a rumor that one company is about
to buy another one, and the stock of the target company soars. The
rumor proves to be false, and the stock price falls back.
</P>
<P>
   The chain of events has occurred countless times. But now
something different has happened. The analyst _ a well-known Wall
Street veteran _ and the brokerage firm that employed him have been
censured and fined by the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange announced Wednesday that Thomas H. Hanley, 56,
formerly the lead banking analyst for UBS Securities, had been
censured and fined $75,000. The exchange said he ``circulated a
rumor regarding an exchange- listed security for which he lacked a
reasonable basis and which might reasonably be expected to affect
market conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   UBS, now called Warburg Dillon Read, was censured and fined
$60,000 for failing to prevent Hanley from circulating the rumor.
</P>
<P>
   A Big Board official said that the exchange has previously taken
action against at least seven other people for circulating false
rumors, but that this one appears to be the first against an
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred on Sept. 18, 1997, when Hanley spoke to
UBS's sales force via what the exchange called the firm's
``hoot-n-holler system'' that connected all of the firm's offices
in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Bankers Trust was ``indeed gone'' and would be
acquired by Travelers Corp. at a price of $162 to $167 a share. The
stock was then trading at about $120.
</P>
<P>
   The stock soared, reaching a peak of $133.625, and Bankers Trust
soon issued a denial. But Hanley, who also appeared on CNBC,
continued to say he thought the deal would happen. It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week, however, Travelers did announce a deal to buy
Salomon Inc., the parent of Salomon Brothers, and it eventually
merged with Citicorp to form Citigroup. Bankers Trust was acquired
by Deutsche Bank in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley has never said why he believed Bankers Trust was going to
be bought by Travelers. Wednesday, he issued a statement saying:

   ``I am known for my detailed research and believe that I had a
reasonable basis for my opinion. The exchange obviously disagreed.
I decided to settle this matter to avoid the distraction and
expense associated with a protracted and drawn-out legal
proceeding. Having opinions is the job of a research analyst. I
look forward to continuing to provide clients with well-reasoned
research.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Board charges said that Hanley did not have a reasonable
basis for the call, but did not accuse him of profiting from it in
any way. There was no mention of any trading by him in the stock.
</P>
<P>
   For Hanley, long one of the best-known banking analysts on Wall
Street, the Bankers Trust call appears to have been the worst one
he ever made, at least in terms of personal effect.
</P>
<P>
   In February of this year, he resigned from Warburg Dillon Read,
and has not yet taken another position. A spokesman for the firm
told Bloomberg News there was no connection between the
investigation and Hanley's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley, who previously worked at Salomon Brothers and First
Boston, has appeared on Institutional Investor's All-American list
of analysts from 1976 through 1999, including a string of 14
consecutive years when he was named the top analyst covering
money-center banks.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that Hanley would have escaped discipline if he
had just said the prospective takeover was a rumor, but he did not.
Instead, he made it sound like he knew what he was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a world where analysts speculating on takeovers is a
daily occurrence, the discipline of Hanley raised some eyebrows.
``We were having merger mania and everybody was buying everybody
else,'' recalled Miles Seifert, the chairman of Gray Seifert, a
money management subsidiary of Legg Mason, of the atmosphere in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every analyst on Wall Street was saying somebody was going to
be bought by somebody else,'' added Seifert, who described himself
as a friend and client of Hanley. ``That seemed to be the job of
the analyst. I'm not sure what is different in this than in all the
other cases.''

(ATTN: N.J.)  
 ADVERTISING: ORIGINAL M&AMP;M'S RESUME THEIR MILK CHOCOLATE IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What does the word ``plain'' insinuate? Dull, bland, simple,
ordinary, boring?
</P>
<P>
   That is how the marketing executives at M&AMP;M/Mars see it, anyway.
So, after 46 years, the company has decided to change the name of
its Plain variety of M&AMP;M's candy _ you know, the one without the
peanuts _ to what it hopes is a more appetizing moniker: Milk
Chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name change is a long time coming,'' said Michael
Tolkowsky, vice president for marketing and licensing at the
M&AMP;M's/Mars division of Mars Inc. in Hackettstown, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all this time,'' he added, ``we've always internally sort
of felt like `Hey, that's not nearly the best way to refer to it.'
M&AMP;M's milk chocolate is too good to be called Plain.' ``
</P>
<P>
   To spread the word about the name change, M&AMP;M's/Mars is
introducing an ambitious multimedia campaign that begins this week.
The $10 million campaign, created by BBDO New York, carries the
theme: ``Same great chocolate. Much better name.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign takes the tongue-in-cheek tone that has recently
become a staple of ads for M&AMP;M's, which are centered on animated
anthropomorphic confectionery characters with contemporary personas
infused with attributes like sarcastic humor and sassy tongues. The
M&AMP;M's characters have been around since 1954, but they had
pleasant, passive personalities, all but begging consumers to eat
them.
</P>
<P>
   That went the way of the 5-cent candy bar in 1995 when BBDO New
York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, was
awarded the M&AMP;M's account.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got the business, the characters were very appealing,
but they were somewhat two-dimensional,'' said Charlie Miesmer,
vice chairman and senior executive creative director at BBDO New
York, who oversees the M&AMP;M's creative effort along with Susan
Credle, a copywriter, and Steve Rutter, an art director. ``We've
made them somewhat irreverent kind of characters that are human.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So when the need comes five years later to announce a product
change,'' he added, ``you can do it in the context of that
background.''
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of the campaign is to lampoon America's seeming
preoccupation with politically correct speech. In one spot that
mimics a public service announcement, to be shown on television and
in movie theaters, people describe their jobs with euphemisms like
``administrative assistant'' for secretary and ``domestic care
giver'' for baby sitter. They are followed by the Red M&AMP;M's
character, which declares, ``I am not a Plain M&AMP;M, I am a Milk
Chocolate M&AMP;M.''
</P>
<P>
   Another commercial features Patrick Warburton, the actor best
known for his role as Elaine's boyfriend Puddy in ``Seinfeld.''
Warburton, who has appeared in three other spots for M&AMP;M's, is seen
with Red looking up synonyms for ``plain'' in a thesaurus. As
Warburton rattles off several unflattering synonyms, Red asks, ``So
you think `plain' is a bad word?'' With restrained contempt,
Warburton looks at Red and says, ``Let's look up `stupid.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``His delivery is marvelous,'' Miesmer said. ``He has this
wonderful, restrained, laconic kind of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   A print ad features Red, with an unusually enlarged head,
growling to his fellow character Yellow, ``Whaddya mean this name
change has gone to my head?'' The ad will appear through early fall
in publications including Cosmopolitan, GQ, People, Rolling Stone
and Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Other elements of the campaign will include a satellite ``media
tour'' featuring the Red character and promotional tie-ins at the
Nascar Independence Race on Saturday in Daytona, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The name change takes the Plain variety back to its original
designation at its debut in 1941: The name was switched from Milk
Chocolate to Plain when the Peanut variety was introduced in 1954.
There have been other changes, like an updating of the logo and the
addition of pictures of M&AMP;M candy pieces, but the familiar
brown-and-white color scheme remains the same. M&AMP;M/Mars conducted
research among consumers to determine whether the name change would
be deemed confusing, Tolkowksy said, and found it would not be.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, though, agrees it's a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just a bad case of what I call tinkering,'' said
Jack Trout, president of Trout &AMP; Partners, a marketing strategy
company in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's habits change so slowly,'' he added, ``and if that
has been called Plain, then it's Plain. I don't care what you call
it.''

AMERICAN FUGITIVE RETURNED TO JAIL AFTER NEARLY 30 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ An American prison escapee _ who for nearly three
decades has led a life of hard work, devoted marriage, and
community service in Canada _ Wednesday surrendered in his home
state, pleading to no avail with a New York judge for leniency so
that he might care for his cancer-striken wife.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 50-year-old physics researcher was ordered to serve
more than three years remaining on a prison sentence for selling
$20 worth of LSD while he was a university student.
</P>
<P>
   The man who today calls himself Allen H. Richardson had his
secret shattered when the Royal Canadian Mounted Police acted on a
tip and arrested him at his laboratory at the University of British
Columbia in Vancouver, where colleagues and friends admired him as
a top technician, loving husband of a desperately ill wife, and
community-spirited citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the case ``brings me no happiness,'' Monroe County Court
Judge John J. Connell ordered Richardson back to prison for the
remainder of his original sentence, despite the life he has led and
the triviality of the original offense.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson is almost certain to remain in prison for at least a
year, during which time his wife may die.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than wage a prolonged battle to stay in Canada,
Richardson _ whose true name is Christopher Perlstein _ crossed
back into the United States Wednesday for the first time in 29
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want this to end,'' Richardson said in an interview
after deciding to return. ``The sooner I finish with this, the
sooner I can be back with my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Said his Canadian wife, Amalia Richardson, who suffers from
recurrent breast cancer: ``This has been ruining our lives. We wake
up with cold sweat and nightmares. It's like living with a
guillotine over your head.''
</P>
<P>
   New York authorities described Richardson as just another
fugitive from justice. It was in 1970 that Richardson, then a
19-year-old student at the Rochester Institute of Technology, did a
stupid thing, selling seven tabs of LSD to an undercover police
officer on campus.
</P>
<P>
   His sentence: Four years' imprisonment at Attica state prison.
</P>
<P>
   Even by that day's standards, it was harsh sentence, and perhaps
reflected Richardson's participation in anti-Vietnam War protests
on the conservative campus as much as the tiny drug sale. A
pre-sentence report described Richardson/Perlstein as a
``wide-eyed, open-mouthed revolutionary'' because of his antiwar
activities, although he had no previous criminal history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, after six horrific weeks behind the steel bars and
electric wire of the notorious correctional facility, he got a
lucky break _ temporary transfer to a minimum security work camp
just days before Attica exploded into America's bloodiest prison
riot.
</P>
<P>
   But when a guard told him he was about to be returned to the
inferno, the frightened young man did another stupid thing,
although it may have saved his life.
</P>
<P>
   He bolted for Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In Toronto, he adopted the false name Allen Harvie Richardson,
using papers supplied by the anti-Vietnam War underground.
Eventually he made his way to Vancouver, where he found work at one
of Canada's leading physics research labs. He married, became a
leader of the West Vancouver Society for Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals and organized free community bluegrass and banjo concerts.
</P>
<P>
   But the past is a relentless pursuer.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities last year were told Richardson's true identity by an
anonymous tipster. After the RCMP collared him at work, Richardson
won release from Canadian jail and appealed for leniency from US
authorities. But New York District Attorney Howard J. Relin opposed
setting aside the original sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In court Wednesday, Judge Connell said Richardson must take
responsibility for his actions and shouldn't be rewarded for
escaping just because he followed a law-abiding adult life.
</P>
<P>
   The case has become a cause celebre in Canada, where editorials
strongly condemned Ottawa's attempts to deport Richardson _ on
grounds that he gave a false name upon entering the country in 1971
_ before US authorities formally requested his extradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has become an asset to both his community and his adopted
country,'' noted the Toronto-based Globe and Mail. ``What is prison
going to teach him about reforming his life (that) the past years
have not already affirmed?''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson could have waged a legal battle that would have
prolonged his stay in Canada for years. But he made a personal
decision to return, saying he wants to end the ordeal, resume
working at the university's Triumf physics lab and, above all, care
for his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've led a decent life. It's hard to accept that I'm a
criminal and should be treated like one,'' Richardson said. ``I
have resolved to go back to prison so that I can return as soon as
possible to be with Amalia.''

SHARP DECLINE IN TOBACCO USE BY ADOLESCENTS REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEGAN SCOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Smoking among Massachusetts adolescents has dropped
faster since 1996 than at any other time in state history, public
health officials reported Wednesday, led by sixth graders who had a
70 percent drop in their use of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The 24 percent overall decline in cigarette use among youth in
grades seven through 12 is especially impressive, said Public
Health Commissioner Howard Koh, because it came at a time when
tobacco companies are spending more to attract young smokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitive evidence that we are inoculating the next
generation against cigarette addiction,'' Koh said. ``Not only have
we seen a substantial decline in youth smoking, but we lead the
nation in cigarette smoking reductions by both youth and adults.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, based on a survey of 6,892 students in 106
communities, found that cigarette use among 8th graders declined 40
percent while, among 10th graders, the drop was 27 percent. Public
health officials said the results prove that the Massachusetts
tobacco control program is having a big impact.
</P>
<P>
   The program, one of the nation's biggest state efforts to
counter tobacco advertising, funds 44 youth programs across the
state and 273 local boards of health that promote clean indoor air
and put pressure on tobacco retailers not to sell cigarettes to
minors. The percentage of retailers illegally selling to minors
decreased from 42 percent in 1994 to 9 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, $250 million, most from tobacco settlements, has
been spent on antismoking campaigns and workshops in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Connolly, director of the tobacco control program, said
Massachusetts is the first state to show a decline in both youth
and adult smoking. The state also boasts the fourth-lowest adult
smoking rate in the nation, according to the Centers for Disease
Control behavioral risk factor survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to reduce youth smoking, you have to denormalize
smoking,'' said Connolly. ``Kids benefitted from higher prices,
clean indoor air, an aggressive media campaign and advertising
restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated $100 million tobacco companies spend on
advertising in Massachusetts, store-front and magazine ads are the
most attractive to adolescents, said Natasha Deleon, 17, a junior
at New Mission High School in Boston's Roxbury neighborhood.
Natasha is a tobacco peer leader at Sociedad Latina Society, a
youth community service agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media, the promotion and the ads _ it's like a pressure
that they have to smoke,'' she said. Youths ``try it and then get
addicted to it.''

 &HT;    CLINTON DECRIES ``BOGUS'' CHARGES OF WRONGDOING
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Wednesday that his personal
conduct in office is not the reason for Vice President Al Gore's
slump in the polls and he asserted that his administration has been
dogged by ``bogus'' allegations of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging White House press conference, Clinton also
expressed frustration over the U.S. embargo against Cuba, which the
president said he had hoped to ease. He put the blame for
continuing the embargo on Cuban dictator Fidel Castro's 1996 orders
to shoot down two unarmed Cessna airplanes, killing four civilians
who flew from Florida to drop anti-Castro leaflets over Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deliberate decision to murder those people changed
everything,'' said Clinton. ``It made me wonder whether Mr. Castro
was hoping we never would normalize relations, so then he could use
us as an excuse for the failures of his regime.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said Israeli and Palestinian leaders cannot make peace
unless they sit down for hard bargaining in a Camp David-style
summit, the prospects for which he plans to discuss on Thursday
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that they can resolve the final, most
difficult issues without having the leaders get together in some
isolated setting and make the last, tough decisions, or decide not
to make them, as the case may be,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some foreign policy problems, the answer is to kick the can
down the road and wait for them to get better and hope time takes
care of them,'' Clinton said. ``My own instinct is that the cluster
of problems here would be better off being resolved sooner rather
than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the remarks during an hour-long appearance in the
ornate East Room, his first formal White House news conference in
three months.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions about the recent spike in gasoline
prices, Clinton said consumer costs would ease somewhat as fuel
supplies strengthen later this summer. Clinton said the country has
been shortsighted in refusing to fully invest in energy-saving
technologies, however, and is paying the price for that now.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we get more production on line, this present price crisis
will begin to abate,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we will have fundamentally higher prices...until we make
up our minds that we are going to drive higher-mileage vehicles and
do other things that use less oil,'' he said. ``But we only get
interested in this when the price of gasoline goes through the
roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the news conference was centered on the presidential
campaign and the presumptive candidates, Gore and his Republican
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll taken last weekend showed Gore
trailing Bush by 13 points _ the Texan's largest lead since last
winter. The poll, which surveyed 560 likely voters nationwide, had
an error margin of plus or minus 5 percentage points. It showed 52
percent of voters favoring Bush versus 39 percent endorsing Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton predicted, though, that support for Gore would broaden
after each party holds its convention in August and he repeated his
contention that Gore is ``the best qualified person to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My instinct is that people are still trying to figure out what
they think about this race,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Without specifically referencing the Monica Lewinsky scandal
that nearly brought down his administration, Clinton said the
public is not blaming Gore ``for anything I did that they didn't
agree with or that was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said on several occasions that he was wrong to have
an intimate relationship with Lewinsky outside of his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these other so-called scandals were bogus,'' Clinton
said, referring to inquiries into alleged wrongdoing by former
Cabinet members and to his speculation in the Whitewater resort
development before he came to the White House in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word scandal has been thrown around here like a clanging
teapot for seven years,'' Clinton said. Then, paraphrasing a
newspaper columnist, Clinton asked, ``Will no one ever stand up
here and say that a whole bunch of this stuff was just garbage, and
that we had totally innocent people prosecuted because they
wouldn't lie, we had totally innocent people's lives wrecked
because they wouldn't go along with this alleged scandal machine?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought of charges by some Democrats that Bush
lacks the intelligence to lead, Clinton took a middle ground
position, saying there was more to the job of being president than
raw brainpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's so much a question of intelligence,'' said
Clinton. ``I think it's more a question of curiosity and
willingness to learn what you think is important...it's a deciding
job.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``No president can say, 'Well, it should be
enough for the voters if I get the best advisers in my party and
they come up with a position and I take it...because I think the
more you know, the better
</P>
<P>
   position you're in not only to draw your own conclusions, but to
take advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright was returning overnight from the Middle East, where she
huddled this week with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat over the prospects for a peace
summit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would discuss with her tomorrow the question of
how deeply divided the two men remain over issues of Palestinian
statehood, territorial disputes and the future control of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Clinton said, he would decide whether the time is right to
press for a peace summit between the two or to give lower-level
diplomacy more time.

 &HT;    Bush charges Gore's policies fueling gas prices
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND, Ohio _ Republican presidential candidate George Bush
came to Cleveland Wednesday to unveil a proposal for the disabled,
but used this Midwest visit to attack Vice President Al Gore over
high gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   Bush accused his Democratic counterpart of supporting higher gas
prices in the past as a way to curb oil usage. Bush also criticized
a Gore proposal that would let the nation's large oil companies
keep a tax break.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent is giving oil companies a huge tax break at a time
when gas prices are out of control,'' Bush said. ``Despite what
some have speculated in the national press, I am not the cause of
these high fuel costs.''
</P>
<P>
   We don't have a national energy plan, that's a big part of the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal Bush attacked would extend a moratorium on a
``royalty tax'' oil companies paid for drilling. The tax break was
established to encourage oil exploration, but it is scheduled to
expire in November.
</P>
<P>
   Gore officials _ who said the vice president supports energy
efficiency, not high gas prices _ say extending the tax incentives
for natural gas exploration in the Gulf of Mexico is designed to
increase domestic energy and cut energy prices for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments are ``a very clumsy attempt by the Texas oil man
to deflect his close ties to oil industry,'' said Douglas Hattaway,
Gore's national campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush clearly favors big oil at the expense of cheaper, cleaner
forms of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   So far Bush has received $1.46 million in campaign money from
the oil industry, while Gore's campaign has gotten less than
$100,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a
D.C.-based watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   Midwest gas prices continue to hover between $1.80 and $2.20 per
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   A couple miles away from Bush's event, motorists at a BP gas
station said they don't really care if Bush or Gore are blamed for
the high prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're worried about playing politics with these prices, but
what good is that doing me when I have to keep pulling out $40 to
fill up my truck?,'' said Ralph Jansen, a 34-year-old construction
worker from Parma.
</P>
<P>
   Before criticizing Gore, Bush toured Vocational Guidance
Services and met with several people who have significant
disabilities. The program employs 70 people who make some of the
uniforms worn by women in the U.S. Army and Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pledged to establish a five-year $100 million federal
matching grant program with local communities to help transport the
disabled to and from work. He also proposed using $45 million in
federal funds to set up 10 pilot programs in local communities that
would develop transportation plans for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Gore officials, however, again blasted Bush for his record on
supporting the rights of the disabled in Texas. Gore officials said
Bush fought against a U.S. Supreme Court decision favoring people
with disabilities who want to live in their own communities rather
than institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that he's running for president, he's changing his tune,''
Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   But in Cleveland on Wednesday, Bush was treated like a movie
star by the vocational program's employees, who crowded into a
small room to give him hugs and handshakes and to seek his
autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed like a real nice guy, we don't get to meet people
like that everyday,'' said Ricky Banks, a 40-year-old who works in
the program from his wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's brief East Cleveland visit continued his trend of making
appearances in places where few Republicans have gone before. His
previous Ohio visits include stops in black and Hispanic
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Cleveland, Bush also attended a fund-raiser at
the Ritz Carlton Hotel that was expected to raise at least $200,000
for the Republican National Committee.

COURT BACKS SCOUTS' RIGHT TO BAR HOMOSEXUAL LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER WALSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Boy Scouts can exclude homosexuals from serving
as troop leaders, the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday, saying the
Scouts constitute a private group that can set its own moral value
system.
</P>
<P>
   For the Boy Scouts the ruling is a victory in autonomy, but gay
rights groups decried the decision as sending a message of
intolerance and as a setback for the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, delivered by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist,
overturned a New Jersey Supreme Court ruling that the dismissal of
a gay scoutmaster, James Dale, violated the state's
anti-discrimination law.
</P>
<P>
   While Rehnquist noted the court was not ``guided by our views of
whether the Boy Scouts' teachings with respect to homosexual
conduct are right or wrong,'' the majority said the law should
respect the codes set by the Boy Scouts, which members pledge to be
``morally straight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that homosexuality has gained greater societal
acceptance,'' Rehnquist said. ``But this is scarcely an argument
for denying First Amendment protection to those who refuse to
accept those views.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts took ``an official position with respect to
homosexual conduct and that is sufficient for First Amendment
purposes,'' he said for the majority that included Justices Sandra
Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's reasoning drew in part on a 1995 ruling regarding
Boston's St. Patrick's Day parade, allowing the organizers to
exclude a contingent from the Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and
Bisexual Group of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But the dissenting opinion, written by Justice John Paul
Stevens, said the Boy Scouts' ``policy statements fail to establish
any clear, consistent, and unequivocal position on homosexuality.''
Therefore, retaining Dale, despite his open homosexuality, could
not contradict the Scouts' policy.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Stevens in the minority were Justices David H. Souter,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased,'' said Scouts spokesman Gregg Shields.
``It's going to allow us to continue our mission of providing
character-building programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale, the former Scout leader, said, ``I'm definitely saddened
by the decision. People don't join the Boy Scouts because they're
anti-gay. People join the Boy Scouts because they want acceptance,
they want community.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan Wolfson, Dale's attorney, said Wednesday's ruling left room
for interpretation, which could mean the exclusion would extend to
all Scouts, not just leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts ``won the right to declare themselves an anti-gay
group,'' Wolfson said. ``Now they have to live with that
discriminatory decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Carla Kerr, one of lawyers representing the Boy Scouts, said she
is confident the Scouts will not face that situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many openly gay 12-year-olds do you know?'' she asked.
``The oldest (Scout) is 17. There has never been a situation of an
openly gay boy in the Scouts. The Boy Scouts will address the issue
when it comes up, and it hasn't come up.''
</P>
<P>
   Paula Ettelbrick, an attorney with the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force Policy Institute, said, ``If the Boy Scouts are
celebrating today, what they're celebrating is their entitlement to
teach young men to be homophobic and that seems a little skewed.
It's a fairly narrow loss in many respects. It could conceivably
apply to the Boy Scouts and no one else.''
</P>
<P>
   The case began 10 years ago when Dale, now 29, filed a complaint
after being thrown out of the Boy Scouts when he was identified in
a newspaper as co-president of Rutgers University's Lesbian/Gay
Alliance. Dale began scouting when he was 8 and became an Eagle
Scout at 17 before becoming an assistant scoutmaster at 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that for 12 years they taught me to be honest
and open with my relationship with other people and to be
respectful to other people,'' said Dale. ``I didn't join the Boy
Scouts because I didn't like gay people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale hopes another group similar to the Boy Scouts will evolve
but without discriminatory policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there needs to be a program that takes the place of
this program,'' Dale said. ``The dinosaurs became extinct because
they didn't evolve, just as Boy Scouts are making themselves
extinct.''

ROCKER'S RIDE ON THE NO. 7: A TOUR OF THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- Here's some news for John Rocker: It may be safer
for you to ride the Number 7 train to Shea Stadium than to take the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who ride the Number 7 or live along it are like
Balinder Kumar, owner of Neena Sari Palace of Queens: Too busy
making their way in America to pay attention to a ballplayer's view
of their right to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know nothing of what you talk about,'' Kumar says, when
asked about the relief pitcher and his famous contempt for the
city's immigrants and minorities. Nothing about Rocker? Baseball?
the Braves?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, nothing,'' he says. ``I have work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   So if Rocker really does ride the 7, he could safely get off at
a few stops along the route, look around, and discover it's a
pretty cheap way to tour the world.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker caused a stir last December in a Sports Illustrated
interview, when he compared the Number 7 to a ride through Beirut
and described its passengers as ``some kid with purple hair next to
some queer with AIDS right next to some dude who just got out of
jail for the fourth time right next to some 20-year-old with four
kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing I don't like about New York,'' he summed up,
``are the foreigners.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Braves in town to play the Mets Thursday, Rocker has
said he will pass up the team's bus ride out to Shea and _ against
the urgings of the mayor and the police _ take the 7 instead.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker is right about one thing: There are a lot of foreigners
riding the 7. What he probably does not know is that the Number 7
line forms the crest of the biggest and broadest wave of
immigration New York City has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   The wave forms right along the 7 line _ which starts at Times
Square, goes east to Grand Central, then cuts a swath through
northwestern Queens. Each station-stop is like a different country.
</P>
<P>
   Get out at 74th St. in Jackson Heights, and you're in some
fusion of India and Pakistan. Go one more stop, to 82nd St., and
it's Argentina and Colombia. The next three stops, at Corona,
you're in Mexico, with sidestreet views of Ecuador, Peru, and
Uruguay. Go to the end of the line in Flushing, one stop past Shea,
and it's China with a bit of Korea around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first stop for many immigrants,'' says Andrew
Beveridge, a sociologist at Queens College. ``100 years ago, the
first stop was the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Today, it's west
Queens.''
</P>
<P>
   And as they come, they settle along the Number 7 line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 7 line was built in the 1920s to redistribute the crowded
immigration populations from Manhattan,'' said Illona Harlow, who
studies these groups for the Queens Council on the Arts. ``It
continues to play the role today. It's close to the airports, and
it's a fast commute into the city where people work.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one big difference: today's immigrants are far more
diverse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1910, five countries _ Russia, Italy, Austria, Germany, and
Ireland _ provided three-quarters of this city's immigrants. Today,
you could add up the numbers from the top 25 countries and account
for just two-thirds of the immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 7.3 million people in New York City, over 2 million _
nearly one-third _ were born in other countries. Of the 600,000
people in western Queens, along the Number 7 line, over half are
foreign-born.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the story of 20th-century America will find
little new in these neighborhoods. Talk with Tomas Gonzalez, owner
of La Espiga bakery in Corona, and you hear echoes of the ambitions
of Italians, Greeks, or Jews who came to New York a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez came to Queens from Mexico in 1986, and sold tacos from
a pushcart on Roosevelt Avenue, just off the 7 line. He saved his
money, and when a Colombian bakery closed down a few blocks away,
took over the lease. Two years ago he expanded into a second
bakery, and gave the original to his son.
</P>
<P>
   The new La Espiga is a hang-out for many Mexicans in the
neighborhood. The jukebox plays popular tunes from back home. A
rooftop satellite-dish brings in TV Azteca. ``This Sunday,''
Gonzalez says, ``everybody will be in here, watching the Mexican
election returns.''
</P>
<P>
   This is another difference with the new immigrants. A century
ago, few could stay in touch with their homelands even if they
wanted to. Now there's satellite TV, airplanes, long-distance
calling-cards, newspapers in dozens of languages, and a cultural
environment that, far from pushing ``Americanization,'' celebrates
ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   The 74th Street stop, where Balinder Kumar has his sari shop,
might jar Rocker the most. While most of the 7's neighborhoods have
overlapping languages and nationalities, this stop is almost
monolithically Indo-Asian.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest Indian shopping district in America,''
Kumar says. ``Not just people who live here, but Indian, Pakistani,
and Bangladeshi people from all over the United States come here to
shop.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, those three peoples have fought wars against one
another. Here, signs on restaurants advertise
``Indian-Pakistani-Bangladeshi cuisine.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehmod Syed, deputy manager of the Habib American Bank, just
down the street, says, ``There are no politics here, just business.
I am Indian,'' then, pointing to another bank officer, ``he is
Pakistani. There are no problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Such assimilation of subcultures is common here. But more
striking is the sharp segregation of broad cultural groups into
station-stop continents.
</P>
<P>
   The Number 7 line explains this, too. It covers a vast stretch
of land; lots of groups have room to spread out. Yet the
station-stops provide natural points for clustering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's word of mouth,'' Syed explains. ``Someone from India
comes to this neighborhood. A relative back home joins him later.
Others follow, knowing the people here speak their language,
understand their culture.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how it has always worked. Groups grow, reach a
critical-mass, then scatter as they become successful. New groups
come and replace them.
</P>
<P>
   Here, even as the immigrant population soars in diversity and
number, the second stage of assimilation has already started _ the
move to the suburbs. But areas like Jackson Heights preserve the
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrant specialist Harlow once saw a woman on 74th Street
drive her car up to a pushcart selling kulfi, an Indian ice cream.
``She'd driven in from Long Island,'' Harlow remembers. ``She had
some ice in a big plastic bucket, and she filled the bucket with
kulfi for her kids. She grew up with kulfi back in India, and she
wanted her kids in the American suburbs to have this in their
childhoods, too.''

   HOLLYWOOD _ The summer movie season had started off so
promisingly. ``Mission: Impossible 2'' racked up $91.8 million in
American theaters on the long Memorial Day weekend, fueling a
record-breaking $171 million holiday and causing swoons of ecstasy
to ripple through the corporate corridors of major movie studios.
After that, who knew what the rest of the summer of 2000 might
bring? Perhaps there would be yet another bumper crop of $100
million movies, just like last summer. Some even predicted that the
hot months would see not just one, but two or even three $200
million blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   And then something happened.
</P>
<P>
   The horizon darkened. The engine began to make a funny pinging
sound. Slowly, silently, the air went out of the tires. And the
summer movie season of 2000 began to sink into the doldrums _ at
least compared with last year's.
</P>
<P>
   There were very few outright financial disasters among the films
released in the five weeks after Memorial Day, the biggest bomb
being the animated ``Titan A.E.,'' which cost more than $85 million
and is expected to bring in somewhere around a third of that,
causing 20th Century Fox this week to close the Phoenix animation
studio that created it. But even the movies that were opening well
(``Gone in 60 Seconds,'' ``Shaft,'' ``Me, Myself and Irene'')
didn't seem to be clicking with audiences with quite the intensity
that movies had exhibited in the summer of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Take it weekend by weekend:
</P>
<P>
   On Memorial Day, strong holdover business from the hits of May
(``Gladiator'' and ``Dinosaur''), mixed with an explosive opening
for Paramount's ``Mission: Impossible 2'' and very promising debuts
for Disney's ``Shanghai Noon'' and DreamWorks' ``Road Trip,''
created a 29 percent increase from 1999s holiday box office, when
``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace'' was early in its
lucrative run. The next weekend, June 2 to 4, when only one major
Hollywood film opened, the Martin Lawrence comedy ``Big Momma's
House,'' there was again an increase, 23 percent, from the 1999
figure for the same weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But each of the next three weekends saw dramatically lower
receipts than the parallel weekends of 1999. On the second weekend
of June 1999, ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' earned
$54.9 million. This year on that weekend, the Nicolas Cage action
film ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' led the field with $25.3 million. On
the third weekend of June last year, Disney's animated ``Tarzan''
was the leader with $34.2 million. This year it was ``Shaft,'' with
$21.7 million. And last year on the fourth weekend in June, Adam
Sandler's ``Big Daddy'' was in first place with $41.5 million. This
year it was Jim Carrey in ``Me, Myself and Irene'' at $24.2
million.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with the grosses for most of these films _
``Shaft,'' for instance, showed much more strength on opening
weekend than most had expected and has been holding up well _ but
as a group they are just not generating as much box-office heat as
last year's crop.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the total weekend grosses for the top 12 films
paled in comparison with those of 1999 _ down 19 percent in the
second weekend in June, 21 percent in the third and 23 percent in
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   And that's only part of the story, because the holdover business
_ the amount of money that movies make in their second, third and
subsequent weekends _ was also, in many cases, weaker than last
summer's, when even a movie like ``The General's Daughter,'' a
Paramount film that never rose to first place at the box office,
could go on to make more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the quality of the pictures,'' said Marvin
Antonowsky, a former studio marketing executive now working as a
freelance marketing consultant. ``There's only one film that's
going to do $200 million this summer, and that's `Mission:
Impossible 2.' You've got the Jim Carrey movie doing something like
half of what the Adam Sandler comedy did in the same weekend last
year. Category by category, from big action pictures to broad
comedies, the films are just not as strong. Last summer we had two
successful romantic comedies with Julia Roberts. This summer I
don't see any big picture for the female audience, no romantic
comedies at all. It's a very weak summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the summer of 1999 was something of an anomaly,
bracketed by the eagerly anticipated return of George Lucas' ``Star
Wars'' series and the unexpected successes of ``The Sixth Sense''
and ``The Blair Witch Project'' in the season's second half. But in
between, the summer also produced one $100 million success after
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been cautious in saying that this could be a record
summer because last year was just so amazing,'' said Paul
Dergarabedian, chairman of Exhibitor Relations, a Los Angeles
company that monitors box-office performance. ``The bottom line is
that last year there were films that people really wanted to see
that were marketed brilliantly and followed on the momentum of
`Phantom Menace.' The whole situation just pushed up everything and
revved up audiences. And the strength of the holdover last year
told us that the word-of-mouth was very, very strong. Ultimately,
it comes down to the product.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Fellman, president of distribution at Warner Brothers,
attributed some of the lackluster box office to the scarcity of
PG-13 movies. Too many movies are R-rated, he said, and that's bad
for the summer, when studios are trying to draw more young people
into theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in a cyclical business, and you never really
know where your hits are coming from,'' he said. ``You have to take
the broader picture. Look at the year to date. It's already up 4
percent over last year for the whole year. If the summer comes up a
little bit flat, I think the prognosis for the fall and holiday
period looks absolutely terrific. I think we may end up the year on
a high note, beating last year's record.''
</P>
<P>
   Some object to comparing this year with last, saying that 1999
was not part of a continuing upward trend but highly unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was abnormally high,'' said Jim Tharp, head of
distribution at DreamWorks. ``I think if you look at an average of
three years or so, this summer probably won't be down quite so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Others point to what they say is a strong lineup of films
opening in the second half of the season as evidence that it is not
too late for the summer to turn around. Those films include ``The
Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps'' with Eddie Murphy, Robert Zemeckis'
``What Lies Beneath'' with Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer,
``The Hollow Man'' with Kevin Bacon, Bryan Singer's ``X-Men,'' the
slasher-spoof ``Scary Movie'' and Disney's ``The Kid'' with Bruce
Willis.
</P>
<P>
   But the turnaround had better begin quickly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Many think that if the summer season has any chance of shaking
off the doldrums, it is with this weekend's new batch of films for
the Independence Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly I think this is a key weekend if we are ever going
to close the gap this summer,'' said Jeff Blake, head of
distribution at Columbia Pictures. Columbia's own picture, ``The
Patriot,'' starring Mel Gibson, opened on Wednesday. On Friday
Gibson will be joined by George Clooney in ``The Perfect Storm''
and Robert De Niro battling animated characters in ``The Adventures
of Rocky and Bullwinkle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What should help us,'' said Dergarabedian, ``is that this
year, with the holiday falling on a Tuesday, you have what amounts
to a five-day holiday weekend. Although you have two of the films
going after the same kind of audience, the action audience, there
is enough time in a long weekend for people to see more than one
film, and I believe they will. Then you have what could be
effective counter-programming with the third film, `Rocky and
Bullwinkle,' which is aimed at a family audience.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks also intends to capitalize on the generally glowing
reviews that greeted the release of its animated ``Chicken Run''
last week by expanding into several hundred more theaters. ``That
was always the plan, to build on word-of-mouth and be in a strong
position for the long holiday weekend,'' Tharp said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor working in this weekend's favor, as least as far
as a year-by-year comparison goes, is that last year's holiday
movie menu was not particularly strong. The top-grossing film was
Barry Sonnenfeld's ``Wild, Wild West,'' which earned $36.4 million
over the four-day weekend, followed by ``South Park: Bigger, Longer
and Uncut'' with $14.7 million. Given a full five-day holiday
weekend and the paucity of the competition remaining at the box
office, this year's holiday films have at least a shot at
attracting more people.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Friedman, vice chairman of the Paramount Motion Picture
group, said it was dangerous to take too narrow a look at the box
office because of the differences between specific weekends, or
even months, from one year to the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're comparing things to last year, it's a pretty
dramatic difference because it was an extraordinary year,'' he
said. Then, sounding a cautiously optimistic note, he added: ``That
being said, I think that, clearly, May of this year was probably as
big as or bigger than any May in history, and June is probably not
going to be as big. But if you're looking ahead to the Fourth of
July weekend, you have some really big movies opening, and my hope
is that it will drive the rest of the business. People like to go
to the movies, and they go more often when they see movies they
enjoy.''

   BLACKLICK, Ohio _ Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday lambasted
Supreme Court justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas for their
opinions against abortion rights and claimed that George W. Bush
would use them as the ``model'' to fill any high court vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   The two justices were among dissenters in the 5-to-4 high court
decision striking down Nebraska's ban on a late-term surgical
abortion procedure dubbed ``partial-birth abortion'' by opponents.
Scalia and Thomas also dissented on a 6-to-3-decision in a Colorado
case where the majority gave states wide leeway to limit
anti-abortion demonstrations near clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, touring the Midwest to pitch his energy policies, said the
dissent by Scalia and Thomas in the Nebraska case was ``very bitter
in tone and divisive in nature.'' Gore said Scalia's dissent in the
Colorado case was ``a particularly convoluted bit of logic.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving to make the direction of the Supreme Court a top issue in
the presidential campaign, Gore said the nation's next president
may be called upon to nominate three or four justices to replace
members of the present court who may retire.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the high court's ``razor thin'' decisions on
hot-button social issues such as abortion rights could be reversed
if Bush won the presidency and could nominate new justices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Gov. Bush has said his models for future nominations
would be Justices Scalia and Thomas, it is obvious that he intends
_ if he ever gets the chance _ to try to change the court's opinion
on a woman's right to choose,'' Gore warned. ``The presidential
election will decide the future of the Supreme Court and that in
turn will decide whether or not we keep a woman's right to choose _
or see it taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force 2 en route to New
York City, Gore said the White House has received no indication of
impending retirements from the Supreme Court. And the vice
president defended his criticism of the dissenting opinions of
Scalia and Thomas, saying that Bush had introduced the justices
into the campaign debate by citing them as ``models'' for court
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush has portrayed himself as a moderate. I think his
views on choice are really quite extreme,'' Gore said. ``His state,
under his governorship, has become the place where a woman's right
to choose is least available, least protected and least defended.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush last November told interviewers that he would use the two
justices as models for any nominations for the court that he would
make as president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, also campaigning Wednesday in the swing state of Ohio with
appearances in Cleveland, said through spokeswoman Karen Hughes
that he was ``disappointed'' that the high court had overturned
Nebraska's ban on late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``States should have the right to enact reasonable laws and
restrictions, particularly concerning the brutal practice of
partial-birth abortion,'' Hughes said, adding: ``Unlike Al Gore, I
pledge to fight for a ban on partial-birth abortion.``
</P>
<P>
   Bush has taken two different positions, both of them in the
anti-abortion mode. He has voiced support for a GOP platform that
calls for a constitutional amendment to ban all abortions and he
has specifically endorsed a constitutional amendment to outlaw
abortion except in cases of rape, incest and to protect the life of
the mother.
</P>
<P>
   But the two-term Texas governor has rejected religious
conservatives' demands that he weed out prospective judicial
nominees by imposing a so-called ``litmus test'' on abortion,
vowing only that he will appoint judges ``who strictly interpret
the Constitution and who will not use the bench to legislate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who also rules out a ``litmus test'' for choosing judges,
told an audience here that he would appoint judges such as the late
Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan who view the Constitution as
a changing document and ``are not locked in the narrow meaning of
words as they were used 200 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Court scholars speculate that the next president may be handed
the opportunity to shape the high court in a way that hasn't been
matched since Republican Richard Nixon appointed four justices at
the outset of the 1970s and Republican Herbert Hoover named three
in the early 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   The four leading retirement candidates on the present court
during the term of the next president are: John Paul Stevens, 80,
appointed by Gerald Ford; Chief Justice William Rehnquist, 75,
nominated by Richard Nixon and elevated by Ronald Reagan; Sandra
Day O'Connor, 70, named by Reagan, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 67,
appointed by appointed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The latest national survey, released Monday by CNN/USA Today,
showed Bush leading Gore 52 percent to 39 percent in a two-way
race. The survey had a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, Americans remain strongly supportive of a woman's
right to choose. An NBC/ Wall Street Journal survey completed June
18, found 57 percent favored a woman's right to choose, 32 percent
favored legalized abortion only in cases where the pregnancy
stemmed from rape, incest or imperiled the life of the mother. Nine
percent favored a total ban on abortion. The survey had a margin of
error of 2 percent.

<P>
   Gore injected his reaction to Supreme Court rulings while
visiting this rural community east of Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In a region where gasoline prices have soared, Gore proposed
providing consumers tax credits of up to $6,000 to buy energy
efficient hybrid electric- and-gas-powered cars and up to $2,000
for energy-efficient new homes, in addition to other steps to boost
the nation's energy efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Chapman, whose six-member family recently bought a new
energy efficient home in a neighborhood of $140,000 homes, said he
had cut family energy costs by 40 percent by upgrading to the kinds
of energy-efficient equipment that would qualify for the tax credit
outlined by Gore, if approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this stuff really does work?'' asked Gore, wearing an olive
sport shirt and slacks and seated on a stack of plywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it does,'' said Chapman, a father of four boys seated
adjacent to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wirth, 43, a father of three who used to sell homes in the
area, said local residents are not blaming Gore for skyrocketing
gasoline prices that have driven up the cost of refilling his
Cadillac to $32.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Clinton and Gore ought to be doing more to cut
gasoline and energy prices,'' said Wirth, who said he was a
Democrat. ``But people around here understand that the problem goes
deeper than the White House. Life has been good for most of us. If
somebody's not working nowadays, there's something wrong with
them.''

   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in Nashville is talking about 12-year-old Billy Gilman,
the little boy with the big voice who blew away audiences at the
recent TNN/Country Weekly music awards show. Like LeAnn Rimes or
Brenda Lee, Gilman is indeed gifted with hornblast pipes in a Peter
Pan body, with the ability to interpret even the most adult of
tunes (a cover of Tammy Wynette's ``'Til I Can Make It on My Own,''
for example) like a seasoned, smoke-soaked lounge singer. But like
a two-headed calf at the fair, the young man's debut is more
sideshow than substance. It's not Gilman's fault. This debut CD,
produced by Blake Chancey (Dixie Chicks) is as studio slick as
anything coming out of Nashville. The boy's voice is extraordinary,
and shows great potential. But Gilman's age creates a curiosity
factor that erodes any lasting artistic expression in his music.

   It's ironic that the song most closely associated with Woody
Guthrie, ``This Land Is Your Land,'' is often regarded as an
American anthem and not the protest song he intended. That's one
reason the clever retread of the song, overlaid with a famous
Guthrie tale of defiance, is such a satisfying highlight of this
marvelous tribute. Featuring a who's who of singer-songwriters,
``Outnumber'' excerpts a stellar 1996 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
concert that emphasized Guthrie's radical, political side. With
standout performances from Arlo Guthrie, Ani DiFranco and Bruce
Springsteen, who provides a riveting cover of ``Plane Wreck at Los
Gatos (Deportee),'' this is a classic musical toast to America's
foremost protest singer, complete with a folk hootenanny-style
closing singalong.

   You might want to keep a paperweight handy for this one. Like
the band's 1996 masterpiece, ``If You're Feeling Sinister,'' the
critically adored Scottish combo's fourth album is lighter than
air. It's quietly soulful and brimming with Burt Bacharach-style
strings and horns, but lacks ``Sinister's'' consistent melodicism
and melancholy charisma. ``I Fought in a War'' is as gorgeous as
anything the band's ever done and ``The Chalet Lines'' is a lyrical
marvel, but too much of it is uninvolving. While it's only
disappointing relative to the band's high standards, ``Fold Your
Hands Child'' feels like a minor work in the canon of a brilliant
band.

to its million-selling debut is basically 13 inviting lures
(interludes excluded). A couple are both danceable and
complimentary (``Wifey''), one is delivered in the stop-start,
theatrical fashion of elder balladeer Gerald LeVert (``When We
Kiss'') and some are kind of clever plays on words (``Cybersex,''
``Jerk''). But thin-voiced crooners R.L., Tweety and T-Low get
overall creative points just for coming up with so many fun ways to
get, um, say one thing.

 &HT;    Family feast
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Daddy, where were you born?'' Yvonne Fuselier shouts across
pavilion No. 1 at the Griffin city park.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a house, I reckon,'' shouts back Jessie Moore of Jasper,
Texas, prompting an eruption of heehaws from the menfolk who had
gathered around to catch up with the retired tugboat captain. After
all, Jessie, his wife, Flossie, and their daughters drove more than
14 hours to attend the Jackson-Moore family reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to every reunion,'' Jessie, 75, boasted just after
Flossie, 79, let it be known she ``had to decide'' to make the long
journey. Sure, he's glad to catch up with the kin. But the real
highlight of the day?
</P>
<P>
   ``The food, for sure,'' he said as he waved toward the
30-foot-long brick island in the middle of the pavilion, crammed
edge to edge with covered dishes, boxes of store-bought fried
chicken, platters of home-baked hams and coolers of iced tea.
``It's out of this world!''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough. There are potato salads, every sort of bean from
speckled to baked, stewed corn, deviled eggs, coleslaws, sweet
potato casserole, macaroni and cheese, cold pasta salads, old-timey
congealed salads, pickled cucumbers, skillet corn bread, biscuits,
coconut cake, angel food dream, cream puffs and peach cobbler, just
to name a few of the offerings.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it's the classic family reunion potluck table _ a
smorgasbord of family culture and cuisine, history and geography,
humor and eccentricities. And it's proof that even in this
techno-time of faceless communication, the time-tested tradition of
gathering for a family feast and gabfest prevails.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so many families living geographically so far apart,
reunions are one of the ways of re-establishing ties with each
other,'' said George Armelagos, professor of anthropology at Emory
University. ``A family reunion is all about re-forming the
community, and food is a very important aspect of what you can
share.''
</P>
<P>
   We hear that even the Hatfields and McCoys, who feuded some 100
years ago, reputedly over timber and a stolen pig, recently met up
to mend fences at a joint family reunion. The highlight? A pig
roast.
</P>
<P>
   Some worry our growing reliance on such modernisms as e-mail and
convenience foods is eroding the family reunion tradition. But
others are using technology as a powerful tool to help bring the
family together and plan the events. And, once gathered, many are
opting for a blend of home-cooked, convenience and catered foods
that uphold the tradition of breaking bread but also fit into our
new-millennium lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   One such gathering was of the Maxwell-Audley-Couper family,
which met for the first time on St. Simons Island earlier this
month. Farley Daniel-Cottrell of Athens found many family members
through genealogy research on the Internet. She helped organize the
event, which included tours and a lecture on family history for
about 75 folks.
</P>
<P>
   And of course they ate, gathering for a picnic by the shore that
combined catering with potluck, and for a Sunday brunch that
included sour orange punch, a recipe turned up in family research.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe, which starts with three quarts of brandy and
includes 18 Seville oranges, was traced to Rebecca Couper, who
lived on St. Simons until 1845. Family legend has it that
Daniel-Cottrell's grandmother, Anne Couper, used to make it for her
friend in Atlanta, Margaret Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   John T. Edge, a Southern foodways expert with the University of
Mississippi's Center for the Study of Southern Culture, said that
though some family reunion tables may be changing to reflect
too-busy-to-cook schedules, the potluck is likely to thrive
precisely because of the curiosity of those like Daniel-Cottrell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't always stand over the stove all day long because we
wanted to, which is why we don't do it now,'' said Edge, author of
the cookbook ``A Gracious Plenty'' (G.P. Putnam's Sons, $30). ``But
I think there is a countervailing influeamily in North Berwick,
Maine, is moose meatloaf. And when some 400 members of the Gazvoda
family gather each August in Canonsburg, Pa., they feast on a
roasted whole pig stuffed with Slovenian sausage and cabbage,
sauerkraut, pierogi, potica (nut roll) and strudel _ all part of
keeping their Slovenian traditions alive.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, reunion potlucks have been key to preserving and
passing on family culinary history. There was some question at the
Jackson-Moore family reunion in Griffin if ``Aunt Janet''
McElwaney's coconut cake and macaroni and cheese would be on the
table.
</P>
<P>
   McElwaney had been ailing and all her effort went toward just
making it to the reunion. But her cake and casserole were there,
too. Daughter Bonnie Brown made the cake and niece Samantha Mimbs
made the macaroni and cheese. Both have been coached by McElwaney.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always gets on me for not putting enough salt in it,''
confessed Mimbs before turning to McElwaney and assuring her she
had done it right for the reunion. McElwaney cast a skeptical
glance.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Gurtis of Parkersburg, W. Va., said that when her mother
died in 1998, family members made it clear they expected her to
bring stuffed cabbage rolls to the family reunions, as her mother
had done each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never made them before, so I practiced several times
during the summer before our reunion on Labor Day weekend,'' she
said. ``They were a hit. So now I'm the official cabbage roll maker
for the family reunion, as my mother was before me.''
</P>
<P>
   Many a reunion-goer has become identified with a specific dish.
``Aunt Ethel always brought the chitterlings, and Aunt Lily, for
some reason we never understood, brought what she called Japanese
fruitcake that always had a strange off-center tilt,'' recalls Tim
Patridge, director of food and beverage at Morris Brown College, of
the family reunions of his youth. ``They were grand occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnessa Holmes of Atlanta remembers those kinds of
get-togethers, too. Her family still gathers every two years, but
lately the reunions have taken a modern turn toward catered
banquets and bus tours. She misses the old-style reunions with
potlucks at the homesteads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll try to persuade them to return to Grenada (Miss.)
and do a potluck next time. I think reunions should be about the
roots,'' she said. But she admits it may be a hard sell. With
family gathering from across the country, hotels are a must, which
limits cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Patridge said he regrets that his family no longer gathers
regularly for family reunions _ something he attributes to
geography and technology. ``Instead of getting together, everyone
wants to talk over e-mail. But you can't touch, you can't smell,
you can't feel anything over the cyber system,'' Patridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Patty Ledford of Blue Ridge said it was technology that
spurred her to organize the Jackson-Moore family reunion, which
used to be an annual event but had lapsed for several years. ``I
got a computer for Christmas; then I started surfing the Net and
working on the family tree. And then I got some genealogy software,
and things took off,'' said Ledford. ``I decided it was time again
for a reunion.''
</P>
<P>
   She kept family members informed on her Web page and posted the
reunion on family-reunion.com's registry. Bruce Buzbee, Webmaster
of family-reunion.com, said he started his site as a lark a couple
of years ago, but has found overwhelming demand for it. The site
gets about 4,000 visitors a day during the summer season.
</P>
<P>
   The T-shirt and banquet gatherings are popular, particularly
with families in urban areas, Buzbee said, ``but from the listings
on our registry, my gut tells me that potlucks are still the
favorite way to do a reunion.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains the popular way with the McCleskey family of
Marietta, which has held a family reunion nearly every year for
more than a century. Most recently, the gathering has been at their
namesake McCleskey Middle School in Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the potluck table took on some new dishes. Sylvia
Caldwell Rankin, one of the organizers, and other family members
located and invited descendants of a slave, Uncle Troup McCleskey,
who research showed had been an important member of the family in
the early 1800s. Several of Troup McCleskey's descendants were in
the Atlanta area, so they joined in the annual food fest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have lots of fried chicken, sweet potato casserole
and four-layer cakes,'' said Rankin. ``Uncle Troup's family brought
some different food _ big platters of ribs and the best homemade
yeast rolls.'' Thus, new connections were made and old ones
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   The food and fellowship was so good at the Jackson-Moore family
reunion in Griffin this year, folks immediately started talking
about the next one. ``I haven't seen some of these family members
in years,'' said Steve Moore of Carrollton. ``Patty, are we going
to do this next year?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I think we should!'' said Ledford, as she watched folks
wander away from the picked-over potluck table. Then she shouted,
``No one better leave until I get everyone in family photos!''

 &HT;    `Decalogue' commands your attention
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you first commit to watching ``The Decalogue,'' its 10-hour
running length stretches before you like a prison sentence. But by
the time you reach the last of Krzysztof Kieslowski's masterful and
melancholy episodes, you won't want it to end. Inspired by the 10
biblical commandments, this urban epic of interlocked stories
absorbs you, becomes the atmosphere you breathe, makes you view
your own life and relationships with new eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Now available on VHS and DVD for the first time in this country
(on two disks or five tapes), this filmmaking milestone marked the
second collaboration of the director, who died four years ago, and
co-screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz. They reteamed to make the
acclaimed French theatrical trio ``Blue,'' ``White'' and ``Red'' in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Centering on a massively bleak concrete apartment complex in
Warsaw, Poland, each of the hourlong episodes teases out sometimes
direct, sometimes elusive interpretations of the commandments.
They're meditations on morality. One of the work's many pleasures
is seeing how the filmmakers took each biblical injunction and
sifted it through the filters of contemporary, workaday lives in
the late 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   In the first (``I Am the Lord Thy God''), a professor's false
faith in his personal deities _ logic, mathematics and the computer
_ leads to tragedy involving his son. The literally chilly tone
(it's set in snowy wintertime) and slow pacing of this opener take
some getting used to, but it primes you for the deliberate,
intimate scale of all the films.
</P>
<P>
   The films hinge on small gestures, changing perceptions, quiet
conversations. But in their understatement and simplicity, they
create an immense emotional undertow for the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Number 5 (``Thou Shalt Not Kill'') is brutally simple in its
effectiveness. An unstrung young man loiters around a village,
hails a cab and pointlessly kills its driver in an extended,
real-time scene that's famous for its detailed, mundane horrors. In
turn, the killer is executed by the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Several episodes touch on more than one commandment. Number 3
(``Honor the Sabbath Day'') includes issues of adultery and false
witness as a married man leaves his family at home on Christmas
Eve, spending the night on a goose-chase with a former lover who
claims she's seeking her missing husband. Number 7 (``Thou Shalt
Not Steal'') is as much about honoring one's parents (or at least
enduring them) as it is about theft.
</P>
<P>
   Through ``The Decalogue,'' you see that no single rule of
conduct can exist without interacting with the others. Pull one
thread, and the whole fabric is imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the films end with a close-up of a single face,
locked in confusion, loss or a sudden bittersweet understanding. In
those moments, the camera seems to take us into the very souls of
the characters. It helps that the actors are uniformly excellent.
It's also a plus that their faces are unfamiliar to us; we seem to
be watching real people rather than actors.
</P>
<P>
   Spoken in Polish, with English subtitles, the movies aren't much
to look at. They tend toward the grainy and dark, but they're fit
for the small screen. After all, they were originally shot for
Polish television in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   That makes ``The Decalogue'' even more valuable these days, when
the closest American television comes to moral exploration is by
making something as dumb as ``Survivor.''

 &HT;    A twisty, lovely look at la dolce vita
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ahandsome adaptation of novelist Patricia Highsmith's twisty
thriller. Matt Damon plays the title character, who travels to
Italy to bring back a rich man's son (the charismatic Jude Law, who
steals the movie). Once he begins to enjoy the Mediterranean dolce
vita, though, Ripley ends up adopting his lifestyle and plotting
murder.
</P>
<P>
   A wan Gwyneth Paltrow drifts through scenes as Law's girlfriend,
while Cate Blanchett turns in a hilarious caricature of a lockjawed
heiress taking a tour of the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   Director Anthony Minghella infuses the film with more overt
homoeoticism than ``Purple Noon,'' a less faithful but more
effective French version of the same novel. In the end, though, the
overt changes make this movie lovely to look at, but
psychologically questionable.

 &HT;    A festive fourth for under $100
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cheers for the red, white and blue on the Fourth of July!
</P>
<P>
   Atlantans celebrate this all-American holiday with patriotic
programs, parties and, of course, the Peachtree Road Race. Food
celebrations range from picnics to buffets to sitdown dinners.
</P>
<P>
   If it's your turn to throw a firecracker of a party on Tuesday,
we'll show you how to do it, at the last minute, on a budget of
$100 _ with a minimum of fuss.
</P>
<P>
   Our choice? An informal neighborhood potluck at 5 p.m. for eight
people. Ask guests to bring a favorite cool summer salad _ who
wants to labor over a hot grill? _ and you spring for watermelon
for dessert. The late-afternoon start allows plenty of time for
food and conversation before everyone rushes off to see fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   We spent our money on such gotta-haves as festive tableware,
stemware, decorations, even edible party favors to savor at home.
Note: Beverages are not included in the cost, but a big pitcher of
lemonade or even a three-liter box of inexpensive wine won't
stretch the budget too much.
</P>
<P>
   To roll out the red, white and blue with gusto, we enlisted the
aid of Teri Craton, a certified meeting professional with Atlanta
Arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a fun, festive atmosphere to make your guests feel
welcome and comfortable,'' said Craton, whose day job is putting on
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``July Fourth is the perfect time for a nostalgic, rah-rah
party. And with a potluck, preparation time is minimal. Remember,
keep it simple and everyone, including you, can relax and
celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   CREATING A FESTIVE TABLE
</P>
<P>
   For a bang-up look, Craton spread a white sheet (or use a blue
one) from her linen closet over the table. Next she placed two
striped banners lengthwise in the center to create a runner, thus
giving dimension and design to the white cloth. She used two pots
of white daisy mums, which she already had on her patio, and placed
them in colorful, Uncle Sam hats _ turned upside-down _ and used as
planters. As an accent, she placed an American flag in each pot and
added finely crinkled flag-colored crepe paper around the flower
stems.
</P>
<P>
   On each of the stars and stripes paper plates, she rolled a red,
a white and a blue fork, spoon and knife, plus a tiny flag, inside
a matching napkin and tied it with ribbon. Over the entire table,
she sprinkled star and flag-shaped confetti. Additional accents:
new candles in white and blue and a recycled red one from
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of plastic stemware, Craton found good-looking, cobalt
blue acrylic glasses and a matching pitcher _ the most expensive
items for the party. But think of it as an investment: You'll use
these again and again, for pool parties or picnics on the beach. To
serve the watermelon, she placed it in a basket (already on hand)
and tied the handles with wired patriotic-colored ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   For a take-home party favor, Craton put four mini blueberry
muffins in a plastic bag, tied it with shiny red ``star'' garland
and a miniature flag.
</P>
<P>
   GRAND TOTAL: $95.22
</P>

   LET'S PARTY
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Williamson, author of ``Entertaining for Dummies''
($19.95, I.D.G.) and consultant to Rich's, offers the following
suggestions on giving a successful July Fourth party:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  There's absolutely nothing wrong with paper plates and
napkins, and plastic forks, spoons and knives. However, no drink
tastes good in a plastic cup or glass. Spend your money on acrylic
stemware.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use a white or blue sheet for a tablecloth. And, if you don't
use paper napkins, red/white or blue/white dish towels make

 &HT;    Furniture details that draw second looks _ from behind
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   High Point, N.C. _ Reach back.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly run your hand along the row of buttons, the metal studs.
Gently caress the shoulders and curvaceous sides. Let your
fingertips dance along the treads of that long intriguing zipper.
</P>
<P>
   Before you know it, you've ``undressed'' the secret to designing
sofas and chairs for today's large rooms.
</P>
<P>
   It's all in the backs.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture, instead of hugging the walls, is ``floated'' more
often these days to the center of the room to form a cozy
arrangement conducive to conversation or watching the tube. As that
occurs, consumers are suddenly noticing bare backs and sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, you'd put a sofa table behind a sofa to soften it,''
said Atlanta interior designer Bill Stewart. ``But now, backs and
sides are becoming so much more expressive, whether it's the shape
of the piece, nail head trim, buttons, finishes, moldings.''
</P>
<P>
   Designers of contemporary furniture, especially Italians, have
always treated sofas and chairs as sculpture, taking into account
how they look from all sides, said Bryan Albrecht of Domus, an
Atlanta contemporary furniture store.
</P>
<P>
   But now, even traditional designs are embracing a mix of
materials, sensuous shapes and dressmaker kick pleats to put the
best face on a back. That much was evident at last spring's
International Home Furnishings Market in High Point, where
traditional styles reign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The backs of sofas and chairs used to be like the back of the
bed. Nobody saw them,'' said designer Larry Laslo, showing new
pieces for John Widdicomb Company. ``Now, they're looking at sides
and backs as well as the fronts _ still lean and clean but with
some decoration.''
</P>
<P>
   Makers of dining room chairs have always gotten it. The most
interesting part of the chair has always been the most visible _
the back _ since chairs are pushed under, more often than away
from, the table. But as rooms grow bigger and ceilings higher,
chair backs have gotten taller, said Atlanta interior designer
Charles Gandy.
</P>
<P>
   For occasional chairs, designers are crafting backs and sides
with open spaces, intricate hardware, raised panels and other
detailing.
</P>
<P>
   Sofas are rolling out of factories with rounded backs, heavy
seams, wood and metal accents.
</P>
<P>
   Even headboards, as beds get floated away from the corners of
rooms, are getting special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is just this big old slab to look at anymore,''
Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe it? Watch your back.
</P>

 &HT;    There's an art to making sweet tea _ and it's being lost
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been said that in the South, you can't marry a man until
you know how his Mama makes sweet tea. Which is to say, folks
around here can be as particular about their sweet tea as they are
about their barbecue and corn bread.
</P>
<P>
   So the most avid fans of the house wine of the South have
created their ``perfect'' formula for the drink after years of
tinkering with tea making.
</P>
<P>
   But a dear friend recently asked me quite sincerely, ``How do
you make sweet tea?'' I was surprised, because he's from Kentucky
and has lived in Georgia for years. I guess I figured Southerners
just knew how to make sweet tea.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it makes sense that many of us don't anymore. That
space in the refrigerator where a pitcher of tea used to be is now
the home for soft drinks and other ready-to-drink beverages.
</P>
<P>
   Good sweet tea, it seems, is in peril in a world where there's
little appreciation for the joy of process _ even the short and
painless process of brewing a pitcher of tea. (Now, what is it
we're doing instead? Oh yes, making money and sitting in traffic
jams.)
</P>
<P>
   Even in restaurants, it's hard to get a good glass of sweet tea.
Where it's offered, it's often too weak or too sweet. And some
mimic restaurants outside the South and offer unsweetened tea only,
pointing to packets of sugar or artificial sweetener as the answer.
</P>
<P>
   It is not. Proper sweet tea must be sweetened when the tea is
still warm so the sugar will dissolve. There is one way to sweeten
already-cold tea, which I'll discuss, but the proper way is both
best and easiest.
</P>
<P>
   Ronni Lundy, author of ``Butter Beans to Blackberries: Recipes
From the Southern Garden'' (North Point Press, $30), provides a
good explanation of the process, starting with the tea.
</P>
<P>
   Plain orange pekoe is the best for iced tea. Lundy prefers
Luzianne; I've always used Lipton. For a 1 1/2-quart pitcher of
tea, use five regular-size tea bags of Lipton's or six of Luzianne.
Ice will weaken the tea, so it's good to start with a fairly hearty
brew.
</P>
<P>
   Put the tea bags in a pitcher _ Lundy recommends a heavy-duty
glass or thick stoneware pitcher. It must be sturdy enough to
handle boiling water. Plastic may melt; aluminum can absorb and
give off strange odors and flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Bring a quart of water to a boil _ grabbing it off the burner
just when the bubbles start to burst through the surface. Pour the
water over the tea bags, soaking them through, and leave to steep
for about an hour. Anywhere between 30 minutes and an hour into
steeping, add about 1 cup sugar and stir. Yes, this is to taste.
Try it with a cup once, then adjust to your sweet tooth. After an
hour, remove the tea bags.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, add about 1 to 1 1/2 cups cold water and stir. Do not
serve the tea until it has cooled completely, Lundy warns. ``If
it's the least bit warm, it will melt the ice in the glass,
diluting the tea and making the drink tepid _ not what you want at
all.'' Fill the glass with ice cubes (crushed ice will melt) and
pour in the tea. A lemon wedge and sprig of mint make nice
additions, though I prefer mine straight up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you find yourself with a glass of brewed tea that is not
sweetened, there is one option for sweet success _ a simple syrup,
like that offered at the Blue Ridge Grill in small pitchers. Here's
my recipe.
</P>
<P>
   simple syrup
</P>
<P>
   Put 1 1/4 cups sugar and 1 1/2 cups water in a saucepan over low
heat. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, until all the sugar is
dissolved. Remove from heat promptly. It should be clear, not
bronze. Let syrup cool, and then chill, covered. Use for up to two
weeks.

   Q: My husband enjoys Blue Bunny, a very healthy brand of ice
cream. But we haven't found it in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marissa McNeel, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: I scream, you scream, we all scream for . . . Blue Bunny Ice
Cream. This cool, reduced-fat treat (no sugar added) is available
at Wal-Mart Supercenter, 1436 Dogwood Drive, Conyers
(770-860-8544). A half-gallon is $3.50.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa-based Wells Dairy was founded in 1913 by Fred H. Wells.
He had the milk distribution route in La Mars, Iowa, as well as a
source of raw milk from dairy farmer Ray Bowers. Over the years,
Wells and his brother distributed ice cream all over Iowa. They
changed the name from Wells to Blue Bunny when a Sioux City man won
a ``Name That Ice Cream'' contest. He submitted his winning entry
after noticing how much his son enjoyed the blue bunnies in a
department store at Easter. The company also makes premium, premium
lite and fat-free ice creams as well as fat-free yogurt in a
variety of flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am trying to find Sunkist Fruit Gems _ a soft, chewy,
sugar-coated candy. These are especially good for someone who has
sworn off chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Carol Hoefs, Tucker, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And another sweet request: I am looking for a local store that
carries the candy Aplets &AMP; Cotlets. They are available by mail, but
the cost of shipping and handling, added to the price, makes a
somewhat daunting total.
</P>
<P>
   _ Frederick A. Pope, Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sweet tooths everywhere will appreciate this info. Sunkist
Fruit Gems are sold at Market Grocery, 16 Forest Parkway, State
Farmers Market, Building K, Forest Park (404-361-8620). A
3.15-pound plastic jar (144 pieces) is $5.45. We also spotted the
fruit gems (1-pound bag, $1.99) at Drug Emporium, 2320 Pleasant
Hill Road, Duluth (770-623-9444). These fat-free,
melt-in-your-mouth confections are made with fruit pectin and
contain no cholesterol or preservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The other request, Liberty Orchard's Aplets &AMP; Cotlets, is
available at CVS, 3010 Centerville Road, Snellville (770-736-6512).
A 5-ounce box is $1.99. Manufactured in the Pacific Northwest for
80 years, these candies are made from the juice of Washington
apples, ripe apricots and English walnuts, and then rolled in
powdered sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you find Advance Carpenter Ant Bait? It was mentioned in
a recent article in the newspaper. I have tried Home Depot,
Wal-Mart and Lowe's, but no luck.
</P>
<P>
   _ Winnie Tallant, Cumming, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Soon you will be able to give those pesky carpenter ants the
boot. We tracked down Advance Carpenter Ant Bait at U-Spray, 4653
U.S. 78, Lilburn (770-985-9388). A 2-pound jug is $70. You can
sprinkle the granular bait indoors or outdoors, wherever you see
the ants foraging. The worker ants take the bait back to the nest,
and it eventually kills the queen and the larvae and, finally, the
worker ants.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I can't seem to find Sweet Baby Ray's Barbecue Sauce in
Atlanta and would appreciate your help. They have a Web site,
www.sweetbabyrays.com, but only sell by the case. Thank you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Todd Williams, Stockbridge, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Fire up that grill. Sweet Baby Ray's Barbecue Sauce is at Cub
Foods stores. An 18-ounce plastic bottle is $1.98. Publix has the
sauce, too. Two 18-ounce bottles are $3 at their stores. The sauce
is also available at Patton's Meat Markets, 3931 Peachtree
Industrial Blvd., Duluth (770-495-0077). An 18-ounce bottle is
$2.99. Dave Raymond and Mike O'Brien, owners of Illinois-based
Sweet Baby Ray's, describe their sauce as having ``a sweet tangy
flavor with a kick.'' Brush it on ribs, chicken or steak during the
last 15 minutes of barbecuing or broiling. And the company
philosophy? ``The Sauce is the Boss.''
</P>
<P>
   An update: Several readers called to say they can no longer find
Beemans, Black Jack and Clove gums. We reported last year that
Adams, the manufacturer, brought back these nostalgic brands for a
limited time. Alas, the gum did not click with too many customers,
so it's not being produced this year. However, if gum fans,
including reader Roger McDonald, want to call Adams _ a division of
Warner Lambert _ and ask it to reconsider making the gum again, the
number is 1-800-524-2854.

JUST ANOTHER CUBAN FAMILY SAGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For immediate release.)  
 &HT;    
 ATTENTION EDITORS: Now that Elian Gonzalez is on his way back to
Cuba, we call your attention to the following ``separate-buy''
article from The New York Times Magazine, which recounts how the
rift in the Gonzalez family developed -- both before and after the
tragedy that landed Elian in the United States and its court
system. For purchase information, see end of text. 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ALSO INCLUDED: A FREE GRAPHIC of Elian's family tree, created in
Adobe Illustrator. It can be sent to you electronically. Simply

 &HT;    
 By TIM GOLDEN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On Thanksgiving, three days after his ex-wife and son went
missing in Cuba, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, 31, received a call from
Miami relatives with the news that his 5-year-old son Elian had
been pulled from the waters off the Florida coast by a couple of
fishermen.
 &HT;    Later, after visiting the child at a hospital near Fort
Lauderdale, Juan Miguel's Uncle Lazaro called again to tell him
that the boy's mother Elisa had perished at sea in an apparent
failed flight from Cuba, but that Elian had survived the ordeal
astonishingly well.
 &HT;    The next day, TV news crews had already turned up at the
hospital, followed by the first Cuban-American politicians offering
their support.
 &HT;    With all the attention, Juan Miguel's Aunt Caridad in Miami had
begun hoping for a second small miracle to follow Elian's rescue:
that her brother (Juan Miguel's father) and his family might
finally have a reason to leave Cuba and join the rest of the
Gonzalezes in the United States ...
 &HT;    But, the story begins in Cardenas, the home of the Gonzalez
family on Cuba's north coast ...
 &HT;    The elegant colonial town built in the 19th century sits two and
a half hours east of Havana _ and due south of the Florida Keys, in
the path of currents that have carried wave after wave of desperate
migrants to the United States.
 &HT;    When Castro and his rebels overthrew Fulgencio Batista in 1959,
Cardenas was, for the most part, remote from the centers of the
uprising. Juan Miguel Gonzalez's grandparents, Luis and Georgina,
weathered the revolution relatively well; Luis kept his job as a
stevedore at the Cardenas port. The couple's nine children _ Juan
Miguel's father, aunts and uncles _ had a tougher time, and
struggled to find any work at all.
 &HT;    Uncle Delfin, then a dock worker in his early 20s, was among
those in the family with great hopes for the revolution. ``I think
I supported them for about a month,'' he said of the Communists.
 &HT;    On March 22, 1962, Delfin was arrested and charged with
subversion. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison. His devastated
mother Georgina, took down the large framed photograph of Castro
that she had put up on the living-room wall.
 &HT;    Later, several of Juan Miguel's aunts and uncles would remember
1962 as the year they began thinking about a new life outside of
Cuba.
 &HT;    For Caridad, whose husband had divorced her and hopped a boat
for Miami, America became a dream of opportunity, freedom and
requited love. When Castro announced in September 1965 that Cubans
with relatives in the United States would be free to leave,
Caridad, then a 35-year-old seamstress, boarded one of the
so-called freedom flights and flew to Miami.
 &HT;    Back in Cuba, Aunt Haydee got a job in a school cafeteria; Uncle
Manolo trained as a mechanic and found work repairing boat motors
for a fishing cooperative; Lazaro emerged as a talented young
gymnast just as Cuba began to pour resources into its sports
program; Juan Miguel's father, Juan, took a job as a police
investigator in the interior ministry, a career choice that not all
his siblings appreciated.
 &HT;    In 1979, with Caridad's help, Delfin got a visa and came to the
United States just months before his mother's death. Another of
Juan Miguel's aunts brought her family in 1983, and Luis, the
family patriarch, followed her the next spring. Manolo and Lazaro
took their families to Costa Rica in August 1984 and applied for
American visas there.
 &HT;    In Miami's Little Havana, the Cuban culture that received them
had begun to grow more diverse with the influx of the younger, more
liberal emigres. At the same time, older anti-Castro exiles were
coming into their own as an American political force.
 &HT;    But in Cuba, the next generation of Gonzalezes grew up seeing
the country differently. None of them knew a world before Fidel. In
the late 1960s and '70s, when some of Juan Miguel's uncles were
growing bitter, when his aunts felt like outcasts for going to
church, some of their children seemed to thrive.
 &HT;    Like thousands of other young Cubans of his generation, Juan
Miguel's eldest cousin, Jose Antonio, became the first member of
his family to attend college, earning a degree from the University
of Matanzas that led him to a job with the ministry of agriculture.
 &HT;    But if Castro had chosen among the cousins for one to champion
his crusade, he could not have done better than Juan Miguel.
Following in his father's path, Juan Miguel joined the Union of
Young Communists at 15 and threw himself into the duties it
presented.
 &HT;    In September 1984, he met Elisabeth Brotons at a birthday party
and the two soon fell in love. When they married, Elisa was just
shy of 16, Juan Miguel not yet 17.
 &HT;    At first, they lived with Elisa's mother, Raquel Rodriguez. Juan
Miguel left school after 10th grade and went to work in a paper
factory, training to become an electrician. Eventually, Elisa and
Juan Miguel went to night school to earn their high school
diplomas.
 &HT;    While he completed his three years of military service with an
army firefighting unit near Cardenas, she enrolled at a vocational
school in Varadero that prepared workers for jobs in hotels and
restaurants.
 &HT;    Varadero, a long ribbon of white-sand beach 10 miles west of
Cardenas, was becoming a centerpiece of Fidel Castro's reluctant
effort to attract foreign capital after the collapse of the Soviet
Union. Its hotels, many of them operated or partly owned by foreign
companies, offered some of the best-paying jobs in the country.
 &HT;    In 1990, Elisa went to work as a chambermaid at the newest
Varadero hotel. Juan Miguel also found a job in Varadero, and
eventually, he and Elisa did well enough to buy a creaky 1956 Nash
Rambler and to build a home for themselves next to his family's
house.
 &HT;    But Juan Miguel and Elisa struggled to have a child, eventually
losing seven pregnancies.
 &HT;    After several years of marriage, they started drifting apart.
Friends saw them as having less and less in common: she loved
clothes and perfume and romantic movies; he liked hanging out with
friends _ and began to go with other women.
 &HT;    Finally, in May 1991, they divorced. Then, several months later,
they were living together again. ``We had always wanted to have a
child,'' Juan Miguel said. ``We got together again to see if we
could do it. And finally we did.'' After months of bed rest and
prenatal checkups, Elisa gave birth on Dec. 6, 1993 to Elian, a
name made up from the first three letters of Elisa and the last two
of Juan.
 &HT;    But as much as Elisa cared for Juan Miguel, she was tired of his
running around. Juan Miguel, for his part, said he felt different,
too. ``She was like a sister to me,'' he said. In February 1997, 11
years after they were married and two months after Elian's third
birthday, they separated for good.
 &HT;    Still friends after the split, they shared custody of the boy
and Elisa remained close to her former in-laws.
 &HT;    Elisa's life began to turn on an evening in August 1997, when at
a Varadero nightspot with friends she met Lazaro Rafael Munero.
Within about two months, he went to live with her at Raquel's
house.
 &HT;    Elisa insisted she had found a good man. The son of an oil
worker, Munero had dropped out of school in 10th grade; at age 18,
he was imprisoned for more than a year for breaking into a hotel
room with a friend and stealing $236.55 from a German tourist. When
he met Elisa, he was 22; his steadiest job had been selling soft
drinks and beer to tourists on the beach in front of one of the
Varadero hotels. Mostly, he made his living as a taxi driver.
 &HT;    ``He would come by here sometimes to pick up the boy or drop him
off,'' Juan Miguel said of Munero. ``We got along with him all
right.''
 &HT;    Less than a year later, he left Cuba in a small boat with three
friends. Elisa's relatives say that he tried to persuade her to go
with him but that she refused.
 &HT;    Four months after his arrival in Florida, Munero bought a
motorized rubber raft to return to Cuba. He was picked up on Oct.
26, 1998 by the Cuban Coast Guard.
 &HT;    Munero spent the next two months there in prison. After his
release, he moved back in with Elisa at her mother's apartment.
Later they rented an apartment of their own and took Elian with
them.
 &HT;    Months later, they set off before dawn with friends and some of
Munero's family in a homemade boat with a balky 50-horsepower
motor.
 &HT;    Juan Miguel says that only in their first conversation after
Elian was released from the hospital did the boy ever speak about
what had happened.
 &HT;    ```Papa, my mama got lost in the sea,''' Juan Miguel remembers
his son saying. ``I told him: `Don't worry. You will be right back
here with me.''' Later that night, Juan Miguel said, his Aunt
Caridad called. ``She told me: `With all this, your life is set
here.'' Several of his other aunts and uncles called with similar
pleas.
 &HT;    ``Then Lazaro and Delfin called, and they started to offend
me,'' Juan Miguel said. ``They started telling me how bad the
government here is, all that. And me _ I have my ideals. They never
said a thing about the boy staying there _ they were just insisting
that we should go there.''
 &HT;    Two days later, the foreign ministry in Havana sent the United
States a diplomatic note seeking the boy's return.
 &HT;    Fidel Castro himself asked him how he felt about the situation
and what he wanted to do. ``He told me I could do what I pleased,''
Juan Miguel said. ``If I wanted to leave, I could leave.
Nonetheless, I told him no. My decision was clear.''
 &HT;    Castro was quick to recognize the episode's political potential:
an issue with the power to galvanize not only the party faithful
but also every Cuban parent and child and millions of people
abroad.
 &HT;    Within weeks of his rescue, Elian had become the biggest
revolutionary symbol since Che.
 &HT;    Castro's enemies were just as quick to recognize a poster child
when they saw one.
 &HT;    According to people working with the family, the cause has been
dominated by the Cuban American National Foundation, which has
sponsored most of the Gonzalezes political activities and advised
them on strategy.
 &HT;    As for Cuba, ``What is clear is that he is going to continue to
be a boy symbol, a boy hero,'' said Ricardo Chapelin, the Communist
Party chief -in Cardenas. ``This battle did not begin with Elian.
Our struggle has been one of challenging the government of the
United States for its attacks against our country. And we will
continue with this struggle, which is one that strengthens us in
every way.''
 &HT;    Elian has strengthened a lot of those who have fought over his
welfare. Fidel Castro hasn't looked so energetic in years. His
adversaries in Miami, while out of step with most Americans,
managed to seize hold of the presidential campaign, bring the U.S.
attorney general to their doorstep and reassert their once-fading
influence on Capitol Hill.
 &HT;    And Juan Miguel's uncle, Lazaro, is said to be weighing movie
and book deals of various sorts.

   WANTAGH, N.Y. _ ``What you see is what you get,'' Britney Spears
sang at the Jones Beach Theater on Tuesday night. And what you get
from this 18-year-old singer is a big smile, a little voice, gushes
of sincerity, hardworking dance routines, shameless advertising and
a determination to play both sides of pubescence for all they're
worth. To an audience full of squealing little girls, Spears
previewed adolescent romance as a realm where all that matters are
a girl's feelings and her wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Spears, whose two albums have sold 16 million copies in the
United States, makes Madonna seem like a tortured artist. She is
eager to please and eager to sell both her music and her sponsors'
products. Her face on advertising posters greeted concertgoers at
the entrance; commercials were shown between sets. Since she is
sponsored by both a camera company and dairy farmers, fans could
have instant photos taken next to a Britney cutout with a milk
mustache.
</P>
<P>
   But her hits, which reached a nation of young mall shoppers,
were what brought the advertisers. Spears gets her best material
from a Swedish pop consortium led by Max Martin. Their songs chug
along in minor keys, pumped up with hard-rock guitar chords and
punctuated by throaty little moans. The lyrics switch between
promises of loyalty and pouty kiss-offs, growing marginally more
assertive on Spears' second album, ``Oops! ... I Did It Again.''
</P>
<P>
   The songs are often about being lonely or broken-hearted,
wishing a lost love would come back. Yet her show keeps her
surrounded with perky dancers who are as compliant as a high-school
clique, following her moves and sometimes raising her aloft. Her
voice, suitable for the lead in a road-show production of
``Annie,'' doesn't often stand on its own; it's carried by backup
singers and, possibly, prerecorded harmonies. But she does make
sure to moan.
</P>
<P>
   As scripted by the Swedes, Spears' main complaint is that people
keep telling her that her dresses are too short. Singing ``What U
See (Is What U Get),'' which insists that she's faithful even if
she likes to dress and dance seductively, she wore glittery jeans
and a halter top and clutched the kind of silver pole that
strippers use. When she reached the line, ``Take me as I am,'' she
twitched her hips in a clear bump and grind. Throughout the show,
she kept tearing away baggy clothes to wear navel-baring outfits
underneath. But she plays the good girl, not the vamp. The boy who
won a ``Meet Britney'' contest onstage got an arm's-length
handshake and a polite ``Nice to meet you.''
</P>
<P>
   With her long blond hair extensions, chesty figure and unfailing
smile, Spears has often been compared to a Barbie doll. During a
set that lasted slightly more than an hour, she went through enough
costumes and scenarios for a Mattel showroom. She was a little girl
in a bedroom full of teddy bears, a fairy tale princess, a
sailor-suited USO entertainer, a hippie goddess, a Catholic-school
cutup and a homecoming queen.
</P>
<P>
   Her finale, of course, was ``Oops! ... I Did It Again,'' about
coyly leading on a would-be boyfriend. Phallic red inflatable
columns reared all around her like avenging lip glosses. As she
sang its last, taunting line _ ``I'm not that innocent'' _ she
descended into a fiery pit, not to be seen again. Equating adult
sexuality with hellfire, she doesn't mind as long as it heats up
her career.
</P>
<P>
   Teenypop shows always have a gaggle of opening acts with taped
backups, and Spears brought along three warm-ups. No Authority,
four young men in tough-guy black T-shirts, had unctuous love songs
and half-hearted choreography; BBMak, who didn't dance, applied
1970s folk-rock strumming and high harmonies to protestations of
love. Innosense, a five-woman group, put the moves of a
cheerleading squad behind catchy, straightforward come-ons. The
tour continues Thursday night at Jones Beach and at the PNC Bank
Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J., on Sunday and Monday.

 &HT;    Mets undecided on giving away villain-laden comic book
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They are superheroes powerful enough to save this
city from destruction, and only one person can stop them.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   A Mets official said Wednesday the organization still had not
decided whether to go through with a comic-book giveaway to kids 14
and under at Saturday's Braves-Mets game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll rely on the advice of our security people,'' said Dave
Howard, Mets senior vice president for business and legal affairs.
``If they recommend we don't do it, we'll defer to their
expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the New York Post wrote that the Mets had
``commissioned a comic book featuring an out-of-town villain who
hates New York and wants to blow up the No. 7 train.'' The Post
described the villain as a ``purple monster.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 7 is the subway line that runs to Shea. Rocker told
Sports Illustrated in December that one was likely to end up
sitting beside an unwed mother or ``some kid with purple hair'' on
the No. 7. To many New Yorkers, the fictitious villain bore a
striking resemblance to the real-life Rocker. Too striking for even
some diehard Mets fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just hyping it up by doing that,'' said Jim Canavan,
34, from the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dangerous, because they're just reminding people of the
whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Howard said the Mets had picked the Saturday giveaway in
November ``well before (Rocker) made any statements to Sports
Illustrated.'' Besides, he said, the plot is about a ``typical
villain'' who wants to take over all of New York City - including
the Statue of Liberty and the subway system - not just the No. 7
train.
</P>
<P>
   A climactic fight between a group of Mets players who become
superheroes and the villain's robot gang does take place on the No.
7.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's because that's the line that goes to Shea
Stadium,'' Howard said. ``We wouldn't want to focus on, say, the
No. 4, because that's the line that goes to Yankee Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the focus is on whether 15,000 copies of a kids' comic book
could pose a security risk.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Howard said, ``We've definitely got a collector's item.''

WILLIAMS SISTERS ROLLING THROUGH WIMBLEDON 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ A rental car was timidly approaching a
roundabout that must have looked like a death spiral to Richard
Williams in one of his first attempts at English driving rules.
Their eyes the size of bottle caps, an uneasy Venus and Serena
Williams tried to coach their dad from the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were having a little trouble, but now we're able to get to
the village without any accidents,'' said Serena, discussing the
2-mile radius of their rented home near the Wimbledon village.
``We're making it a little farther each day.''
</P>
<P>
   So get out of their way. Roads, lawns, nowhere is safe. Together
again, the sisters are barreling through the All England Club, with
horns blowing and their confidence on high beams. Just as they did
when they romped through the U.S. Open last summer, they are
healthy of body and full of enough verbal spirit to irritate
Martina Hingis _ once again. And if John McEnroe would rather the
duo try a dose of humility _ as listeners said he suggested on
television this week _ that's not their style.
</P>
<P>
   With a glittering, feathery bow in her hair from the Liberace
collection, eighth-seeded Serena Williams dominated Court 18 at
high noon with such powerful strokes that she all but left dimples
in the strings of the helpless Yvette Basting. In 35 minutes,
Williams wiped away the 186th-ranked woman in a 6-1, 6-0 warm-up
drill. An hour later, fifth-ranked Venus Williams flaunted her
speed and wingspan on Court 1 to chase down every angled shot off
the racket of 20th-ranked Ai Sugiyama for a 6-1, 6-4, victory in 65
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple and swift start to a third day of Wimbledon that
quickly underwent a gloomy and grumpy transformation. As if on cue,
a bank of clouds closed in on the sun. Suddenly, spats started to
erupt on the courts and darkness began falling on Pete Sampras'
half of the draw.
</P>
<P>
   As the top-seeded Sampras labored in pain but finally put away
Karol Kucera before nightfall, 7-6 (9), 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, his path to
Roy Emerson's Grand Slam record became easier.
</P>
<P>
   By early evening, third-seeded Magnus Norman, sixth-seeded
Cedric Pioline and 11th-seeded Richard Krajicek had been upset. The
only seed left in Sampras' half of the draw is No. 9 Thomas
Enqvist.
</P>
<P>
   But can Sampras' body hold out? Wednesday, Sampras appeared even
more distressed than usual. In the fourth set, he played through a
suddenly inflamed foot, managing to hold his concentration with a
false alarm ringing in the background, all while Kucera was popping
a stream of unrelenting returns.
</P>
<P>
   For Sampras, every point was a chore. Even as he served for the
match at 5-4 in the fourth set, he squandered three match points
and double faulted twice before winning on a whistling second serve
down the middle that glanced off Kucera's racket.
</P>
<P>
   Wincing as he exited, Sampras left the grounds without talking
and went to a local hospital to have a magnetic resonance imaging
test on his left foot. Until a further evaluation on Thursday, it's
unclear whether he'll be ready for his third-round match on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While the men's draw is on the verge of disarray, the women's
draw is more intact. Hingis joined the Williams sisters by
advancing to the third round Wednesday with a 6-4, 6-1 victory
against Jing-Qian Yi. Although Anna Kournikova was not considered a
viable threat, a Clearasil-packing crowd of boys mourned the
instant she was aced by Anne-Gaelle Sidot on match point.
</P>
<P>
   At least the broken hearted were civil in their disappointment.
Elsewhere, tempers were heating up. After a five-set loss, the
prickly Jeff Tarango refused to shake the hand of fellow American
Paul Goldstein, and he later accused his opponent of faking an
injury. During his upset of Krajicek, Wayne Ferreira smashed his
racket in half over a call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised by the weakness of my racket,'' Ferreira said.
``I was frustrated, I wasn't angry.''
</P>
<P>
   The distinction between real emotion and gamesmanship was
blurred Wednesday. It was particularly hard to separate sarcasm
from ego when the Williams sisters coyly answered their critics.
With their power and sculpted forms, some have wondered when
strategy will creep into their game plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have great bodies, yeah,'' Serena said with a
sly smile. ``Nice, slim, sexy bodies. They're right.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to go out the way Venus and I have and win a lot of
tournaments _ and have a Grand Slam between us _ I think we have
definitely grown in our game.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams also had her own clever way of addressing any
concerns about the sisters' humility. ``I believe that Serena and I
are very polite, because that's the way our parents taught us to
be,'' Venus said. ``But I believe that when Serena and I lose a
match it's because we beat ourselves, not because the other player
beats us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It's this kind of confidence that rivals that of Hingis, the
head honcho of self-esteem. Like Hingis, the Williams sisters have
no trouble being blunt about the force of their games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was popping it today,'' said Serena, who served up eight
aces. ``It was amazing. Sometimes, I had to pinch myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing in their first Grand Slam together since the U.S. Open
because of injuries, the Williams sisters have a way of splashing
color on a gray day. Until Wednesday, Hingis has had little to say
about them. But in a news conference, she was told about Serena's
views concerning the dating scene around the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there's a lot of action going on around the tour,''
Serena had said, taking note of the relationships between Jennifer
Carpiati and Xavier Malisse, Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf, plus
Hingis and Norman. ``Every day I see things, my eyes light up,
`Whoa, I didn't know.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm really focusing on my career. Basically, I'm
really trying to keep that No. 1 in life. It's really hard if you
get involved in a relationship. Next thing you know, your game goes
down, all kinds of things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis bristled at the idea that a boyfriend on the tour could
be an albatross to anyone's career. ``I don't know if she has had
any experiences, so how can she talk about that?'' Hingis said. ``I
don't think my game went down so far, so I'm doing pretty good. I'm
happy with my relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth is on. But it can only last for so long.
Venus, Serena and Hingis are on the same side of the draw. In the
finals, Hingis won't meet one of the Williams sisters and Venus and
Serena won't meet each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish my girls weren't in the same half of the draw,'' said
Richard Williams. ``I think one can make it, though. People forget
that this whole world is built on confidence. That's why Serena
says she should dominate this tournament. Venus and Serena, they're
race horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it's best to get out of their way.

CALCULATIONS FOR A FLAGSTONE PATH

<TEXT>
<P>
   Stone is one of the oldest building materials. It is denser and
heavier than most others, and for this reason it is generally used
for smaller and simpler do-it-yourself projects.
</P>
<P>
   Stone is characterized by its shape. Ashlar is cut stone.
Flagstones are flat stones used for surfacing walls and paths.
Cobblestones are rounded stones, and fieldstones are stones found
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Laying down a flagstone path does not require any special skills
and only a few basic tools are needed, but it is still hard work.
You will have to move a lot of soil, carry buckets of sand and lift
heavy stones.
</P>
<P>
   Start by laying out the general outline of the path on the
ground with stakes and cord. Since flagstones are irregular in
shape, the path does not have to be perfectly straight or even a
consistent width.
</P>
<P>
   When you have the perimeters of the path staked out, you can
calculate its area and estimate the amount of material you will
need.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, you can lay flagstones directly on the ground
(after removing a few inches of topsoil so the stones are level
with the surrounding areas), provided the soil has good drainage.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be easier to level the stones and create better
drainage if you construct a sand bed first.
</P>
<P>
   To calculate the amount of sand needed, multiply the area of the
path (in inches) by 2 inches (the depth of the sand bed). This will
give the volume of sand (in cubic inches) that you will need.
</P>
<P>
   Calculating the amount of stone is more difficult because the
stones vary in size and shape.
</P>
<P>
   Flagstones are generally grouped according to thickness. Thicker
flagstones cost more than thinner ones, so you will get more
coverage for the money with thinner stones. But stones less than 1
inch thick break readily and are easily kicked out of place. So it
is best to buy stones at least 1 1/2 inches thick.
</P>
<P>
   You can find building sand, and flagstones at some larger home
centers and lumberyards, or look in the Yellow Pages under
``Landscape Equipment and Supplies'' and ``Stone, Natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Discuss your plans with the dealer to find out the amount of
stone needed. He can tell you roughly how many square feet of
coverage you will get from a particular type of stone and the cost
involved.
</P>
<P>
   After you have ordered your materials, excavate the path area
deep enough to accommodate the average thickness of the stones and
2 inches of sand. Check to make sure the depth is uniform by laying
a 2-by-4 across the path and measuring from the bottom edge of the
board to the scooped-out ground with a ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Next, lay landscape fabric on the ground. Landscape fabric is
made of plastic, not cloth.
</P>
<P>
   The fabric comes in a roll and is spread to create a barrier
between the ground and sand bed that will keep weeds from growing
up between the stones. If the fabric is too wide, you can trim it
with scissors.
</P>
<P>
   Use a bucket or shovel to dump sand on top of the fabric. Smooth
the sand into an even layer about 2 inches deep, then tamp it down.
</P>
<P>
   You can make a tamper by nailing a piece of scrap board (about
6-by-6 inches) to the end of a 4-by-4. Hold the 4-by-4 upright and
bring it down so the board on the end flattens the sand into a
compact layer.
</P>
<P>
   This technique works well for small areas, but for a large path
you may want to rent a power tamper from a tool store.
</P>
<P>
   When the sand bed is compacted, you can start laying the stones.
If you want your path to have neat borders, pick out stones with
straight edges and lay them along the edges then fill in the area
in between.
</P>
<P>
   Place each stone on the sand, then wiggle it back and forth to
seat it.
</P>
<P>
   Positioning the stones in a pleasing overall pattern will
require considerable trial and error because each stone has a
different shape.
</P>
<P>
   In narrow places you may have to cut large stones to fit, but it
is difficult to make precise cuts because flagstone is irregular in
composition and thickness.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to make a cut is by scoring a line on the stone
with a cold chisel. Place a metal pipe under the score line, then
strike the waste end of the stone with a heavy hammer. Be sure to
wear heavy-duty gloves and goggles while doing this.
</P>
<P>
   Once all the stones are in place, shovel sand over the entire
walk and sweep it into the cracks with a broom. Spray the walk with
a fine mist from a garden hose to dampen and compact the sand.

 &HT;    Fed leaves rates unchanged, but warns of inflation threat
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA, _ The Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates
unchanged on Wednesday, but its warning that inflation is still a
risk is expected to roil investment markets for ``the foreseeable
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee ended a scheduled,
two-day session without changing the 6.5 percent target rate for
its federal funds, the rate banks charge each other for overnight
reserve loans.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fed's post-meeting statement explaining its actions was
a good news/bad news document for Wall Street and for borrowers
generally, who have been suffering from rate increases already in
place.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that economic demand ``may be moderating,''
thanks mainly to productivity gains that have kept costs under
control despite slight increases in consumer prices during the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fed also said that evidence of slower growth is still
``tentative and preliminary,'' and that tight labor markets are
still a problem.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Fed said there is still a risk that economic
conditions ``may generate heightened inflation pressures in the
foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's analyst David Kim said the stock market's
attention now shifts to what the Fed will do at its Aug. 22
meeting, and that _ like the June session _ will depend on the
economic news between now and then.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. financial markets are likely to lurch from one economic
release to another (indefinitely),'' said Kim. ``Next week's
release of the June purchasing managers' and payroll reports will
be the first notable reports.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market posted only subdued approval of the Fed's
action, which most analysts had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Except for small stocks, the market's initial buying spree was
followed by late selling that almost wiped out the gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average advanced only 0.2 percent for
the day and the broader S&AMP;P 500 index 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Nasdaq composite, which gained just over 2 percent on
buying of technology stocks, suffered a late sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks advanced all day
to close with a gain of 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, analysts were also cautious in interpreting
the Fed's move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the Fed left interest rates unchanged at their
June meeting should not be interpreted that they have finished
hiking rates this year,'' said First Union economist Mark Vitner.
``The Fed has clearly not fully bought into the slowdown
scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   July, however, is likely to be a respite for the stock market,
as investor attention shifts toward second-quarter corporate
earnings reports _ which are expected to be strong.
</P>
<P>
   Charles L. Hill, research director of First Call/Thomson
Financial, said ``all the earnings indicators'' for the quarter are
more positive than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second-quarter final earnings results are likely to show a
year-over-year increase of 22 percent to 23 percent for the S&AMP;P
500,'' said Hill. ``That would be close to the six-year record of
23.6 percent in the first quarter of the current year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill said the earnings pre-announcements that companies make
prior to official reports, usually to warn of bad news, have been
``somewhat less negative than normal.''

ARTS IN AMERICA: THE STAR OF LITTLE ROCK: AN ARTS FOUNDLING GROWS
UP 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE BARNES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Visitors to this small Southern city
(metropolitan population: 570,000) are often struck by the gap
between its reputation as an intellectual backwater and the reality
of its cultural offerings: A nationally recognized symphony, a
civic ballet, a comprehensive university fine arts department, two
repertory theater companies and a small but state-of-the-art
performance center.
</P>
<P>
   City officials seeking to recruit corporate and industrial
businesses always include a tour of the newly expanded Arkansas
Arts Center, which is now, more than ever, at the heart of Little
Rock's cultural life. A two-year campaign that ended in February
raised $22 million, which was used mostly to increase the center's
gallery and classroom space from 65,000 square feet to 100,000. On
a recent visit, President Clinton pronounced himself
``overwhelmed'' as he was led through the center's new two-story
atrium of blond wood and slate into a gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The center's permanent collection includes a Diego Rivera
painting, ``Two Women''; a Degas pastel, ``Dancing Trios Before
Class''; a Rodin bust of a young Balzac; and a Picasso oil, ``Still
Life With Red Bull's Head,'' among other works. There are works on
paper by Delacroix, Vuillard, Bonnard, van Gogh, Rubens and
Rembrandt, and sculpture by Louise Nevelson and Henry Moore.
</P>
<P>
   The permanent collection is valued at $40 million, according to
Townsend Wolfe, the Arts Center's director and chief curator. Janie
Lee, a curator at large for the Whitney Museum of American Art in
New York, described the center's holdings as ``incredibly
important.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arts Center's first serious benefactor was Winthrop
Rockefeller, who served as Arkansas' governor. When he moved to the
state in the 1950s Rockefeller found Arkansas' cultural menu rather
skimpy. So he set about replacing the down-at-the-heels Museum of
Fine Arts, which by that point the townspeople essentially ignored.
He led a fund-raising campaign in Arkansas for a new arts center to
be constructed around the old, seeded the project with his own
money and coaxed more from his brothers Nelson, David, Laurance and
John.
</P>
<P>
   ``Win was the key man,'' recalled Jeane Hamilton, 74, doyenne of
the Little Rock arts community. ``The museum was a dead beast, and
the arts were something the people of Little Rock had not given a
lot of thought to. Without Win, we would have never got the center
off the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Arkansas Arts Center opened in 1963, Rockefeller and
his wife, Jeanette, struggled to keep it afloat financially. The
center was started as a degree-granting institution with ambitious
programs in theater, sculpture and painting. Almost immediately, it
had staggering deficits, which Rockefeller absorbed for a while. In
its first four years it had five directors.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe, a native of South Carolina, was recruited for the job of
director by and Rockefeller in 1968 from a teaching position at the
Wooster School in Danbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Win that I would take the job on condition that I run
the place with no meddling by others,'' Wolfe remembered. ``I said,
`If I'm going to be fired it's because I didn't do the job, not
because I let somebody else try.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe, who was then 32, set about imposing order on the artistic
and administrative chaos he discovered in Arkansas. ``I tried to
figure out how they ran up those deficits,'' he said, ``and I never
could.'' He eliminated the degree programs, restricted performing
arts to a children's theater and, crucially, narrowed the center's
acquisitions focus to French, Italian and American drawings
``because it was something at which we could excel.''
</P>
<P>
   The passion of that era for paintings, Wolfe said, made the
acquisition of drawings easier and less expensive. ``Few
institutions and fewer people were collecting drawings back then,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he snatched up a Richard Diebenkorn watercolor for
$3,500 in 1973; today, Wolfe suggested, it might fetch $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people want paintings for their historical value,'' said
Lee, the Whitney curator, ``and drawings are of secondary
importance to them. Townsend had the courage to see beyond that, to
recognize that drawings aren't secondary. And the level of quality
he's maintained in Arkansas makes that collection very
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Werner Kramarsky of New York, a prominent collectors of works on
paper, described the Arkansas museum's holdings ``as one of the
most important contemporary drawings collections in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an almost immeasurable treasure, a superb example of
careful, connoisseur-based collecting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, the center took a gamble to broaden its financial base
by rejecting a bequest of $1 million from the executors for
Rockefeller, who died that year. ``People would have thought Win
was taking care of us from the grave,'' Wolfe explained.
</P>
<P>
   Instead Wolfe suggested that the trustees challenge the center
to raise $500,000 from local private sources with a 3-to-1 matching
provision from the Rockefeller estate. When Arkansans responded by
contributing $750,000 in two months, the Rockefeller family matched
the extra $250,000 as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Arkansas had to have title to it, had to feel
that it was truly theirs before the arts center could flourish,''
Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
   The center continues to benefit from Rockefeller support
nonetheless. Lt.. Gov. Winthrop Paul Rockefeller, son of Winthrop,
is a contributor, and Abby Rockefeller Mauze, sister to the five
brothers, donated the Rivera. David Rockefeller donated a 1912 oil
by Redon, ``Andromeda.'' Laurance Rockefeller contributed 22
drawings and prints this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the center's latest, and largest, benefactors have been
homegrown. Jackson Stephens, a Little Rock investment banker,
contributed $5 million to the expansion campaign, then donated the
Picasso, the Degas and 13 other works from his private collection.
They include oils by Degas, Bonnard, Monet, Vuillard and Pissaro.
</P>
<P>
   Recently James Dyke, a local businessman, deeded to the center
his collection of 133 watercolors and sketches by Paul Signac. This
collection will tour Europe and stop at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art in New York before returning to Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   In Wolfe's 32 years as director the arts center's endowment has
grown from $34,000 to almost $23 million, and its holdings have
expanded from fewer than 800 works to more than 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of people _ measured in contributions,
gallery visits, outreach programs and enrollment in arts classes _
are involved in the center, and its annual fund-raising dinner and
auction is the highlight of Arkansas' spring social season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started going to New York to buy things, the
reaction was, `Who is this sucker?''' Wolfe said.``I don't get that
any more.''

 &HT;    WestPoint Stevens to restructure
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ WestPoint Stevens said it will take a $195 million
pre-tax charge in the second quarter to restructure operations this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The West Point maker of sheets and towels said Wednesday it will
consolidate manufacturing plants and get rid of some support and
administrative jobs as it tries to pay off debt.
</P>
<P>
   In its first public comments since a derailed plan to go
private, the company did not disclose which of its 29 plants would
be affected.
</P>
<P>
   The 186-year-old company said it will also import more goods in
every product category than it manufactures at its own mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, we're looking at doing more with less corporate
overhead,'' said Lorraine Miller, senior vice president of investor
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring will result in savings of $5 million this year
and $15 million next year, a WestPoint Stevens press release said.
After that, the company expects to save $29 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing debt is a priority for WestPoint Stevens. On Wednesday,
Moody's Investors Service downgraded the company's senior long-term
debt and said the outlook is negative.
</P>
<P>
   The lowered rating reflects a ``weak balance sheet,'' Moody's
said. Debt levels are approaching revenues of the West Point-based
maker of sheets and towels, Moody's noted, and the home furnishing
market is showing signs of a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Miller of WestPoint Stevens said the reorganization could lead
to sales growth of about 10 percent a year, up from last year's 6
percent growth. She projected long-term earnings growth of 20
percent and up.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get that kind of top-line growth, either they're going to
be selling higher-priced products. . . or they're going to make
some acquisitions,'' said analyst Kay Norwood of Wachovia
Securities. ``Acquisitions are likely because there are a lot of
companies out there that just aren't (big enough) to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   WestPoint Stevens didn't offer many details on its new strategy
Wednesday. Norwood said she was looking forward to more particulars
when the company outlines the plan today at its annual shareholder
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market won't take to a huge restructuring charge like this
without the details on what they're doing,'' Norwood said.
</P>
<P>
   WestPoint Stevens stock has lost half its value this year. The
stock closed at $10.75 Wednesday, up 56 cents.
</P>
<P>
   In late March, Chairman and Chief Executive Holcombe Green Jr.
led a buyout team for the company shares they didn't already own.
But the buyout plan collapsed when rising interest rates prompted
an investor to pull out.

   A CAMERA THAT PACKS ITS OWN CD-R DRIVE
</P>
<P>
   If anyone needs further proof that compact disc technology is
becoming as common as magnetic tape found in audio and video
cassettes, look to Sony's newest Mavica digital still camera.
</P>
<P>
   Its high-resolution pictures _ 2.1 megapixels _ are not stored
on conventional flash memory cards, nor on 3.5-inch floppy disks
like previous models, nor even on Sony's own MemorySticks. Instead,
the Mavica MVC-CD1000 carries a CD recorder that stores up to 160
snapshots on a recordable 3.5-inch CD.
</P>
<P>
   Sony executives said the $1,300 camera, expected to be available
in the United States in August, was the first of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are believed to use as many as 260 million CD or CD-R
drives on their personal computers, Sony estimates. By placing
pictures directly on small high-capacity CD-Rs, consumers can place
the discs _ about a third of the size of full-size CDs _ in
conventional CD-ROM and CD-R drives and view their pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-Rs can store up to 156 megabytes of digital information,
compared with a floppy disk that stores up to 1.44 MB and
MemorySticks that have a current capacity of 64 MB. Perhaps the
biggest benefit, Sony spokesmen said, is that the special CD-Rs are
relatively inexpensive, costing about $4 per disc.
</P>
<P>
   Storing pictures in the camera on a CD-R shortens recording time
in the Mavica, making it possible to shoot more images more rapidly
than models using other storage mediums, according to Sony
specifications on the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Like earlier Mavicas, the MVC-CD1000 includes optical zoom and a
digital image stabilization that eliminates unwanted shakes.

   MP3 PLAYER CLICKS WITH TECHNOLOGY FROM IOMEGA
</P>
<P>
   Iomega Corp., a maker of portable storage devices and media for
computers, announced this week that it was collaborating with
consumer electronics companies to produce a new kind of audio
player that uses its relatively low-cost, mechanical Clik drive.
</P>
<P>
   The the RaveMP 2300 digital media player, which is expected to
be in stores next month, may represent a breakthrough in permitting
users to cheaply store downloadable music and other audio files for
palm-size devices.
</P>
<P>
   Most devices, commonly referred to as MP3 players, use flash
memory cards that cost about $100 and store little more than 30
minutes of CD-quality music. The Clik disc, which holds 40 MB or
about 40 minutes of near CD-quality music, costs about $10 each.
There are other devices that are capable of storing hours of music,
but they have turned to much larger and heavier hard drives
commonly used in laptop computers to accomplish this.
</P>
<P>
   The RaveMP 2300 player, made by Sensory Science, has a slot on
top of its sleek body. A Clik disc, which is about 2 inches square,
fits into that slot.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Rathbun, director of Clik Original Equipment Manufacture
and channel product management for Iomega, said the Clik drives
(the only moving parts in the otherwise solid-state player) spin
only for a short time to transfer audio files to a memory chip
inside the device; the chip is then drawn upon to play audio
signals.
</P>
<P>
   The Clik drive does not make the player more susceptible to
skips when it is played on the go, Rathbun said. ``You can shake
and bake it as much as you want,'' he said of the Rave's stability.
</P>
<P>
   The RaveMP 2300 uses rechargeable lithium-ion batteries and has
an estimated 10 hours of continuous playback on a single charge.
The estimated price will be $299.

   FROM RAILS TO TRAILS, WITH MILES AND MILES TO EXPLORE
</P>
<P>
   More than 11,000 miles of abandoned railroad corridors have been
converted into public trails and greenways for activities like
walking, bicycling, horseback riding and cross-country skiing.
</P>
<P>
   The trails, which pass through urban, suburban and rural areas
for from two-tenths of a mile to more than 200 miles, can be found
on an online directory started by the Rails to Trails Conservancy
(www.traillink.com).
</P>
<P>
   There are also links, like one for the Virginia Creeper Trail,
which runs along the former right-of-way of the Virginia-Carolina
Railroad from Abingdon, Va., to North Carolina.

<P>
   AN E-BOOK READER PRICED FOR THE MASSES
</P>
<P>
   The e-book market got another boost this week as Franklin
Electronic Publishers unveiled the first hand-held reader to be
sold for less than $150. The slim, lightweight device, called the
eBookMan, will be sold in at least three versions this fall, with
prices starting at $129.95.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough for people to spend $500 on a machine to read a $20
novel,'' said Barry Lipsky, Franklin's president and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   The machine will also function as an MP3 player, a listening
device for digital audio books, an address book, schedule keeper
and a repository for voice memos. It includes a stylus and is
designed to recognize handwriting.
</P>
<P>
   The least expensive version, Lipsky said, will probably be
issued in a translucent blue. It will feature 8 MB of RAM, enough
room for about 20 novels. The $179.95 model has the same features
with a clearer screen, a back-light and a forest green shell. The
silver-colored model, for $229.95, includes all those options plus
16 megabytes of RAM. Each model includes a slot for a multimedia
card for extra memory.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin has years of experience in developing hand-held
electronic dictionaries and translators that sell for as little as
$15. Instead of having to dumb down a high-priced computer, Lipsky
said, Franklin was able to capitalize on its experience in the
low-end market.
</P>
<P>
   Prototypes of the eBookMan, shown at PC Expo in New York this
week, look like Palm organizers at first glance. They also come
with a cradle that plugs into a computer through a USB port. But
the screen is several inches longer and an inch wider than most
hand-held organizers.
</P>
<P>
   It is that extra size, said Peter Yianilos, the company's chief
technology officer, that makes reading Huck Finn an easier
experience than squinting to read it on other hand-held organizers.
For years, books, magazines and newspapers have been printing
columns of eBookman size. ``People are used to dealing with text of
that width,'' he said.

 &HT;    International soccer notebook: France's `golden goal'
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``golden goal'' was priceless for France, which got a
penalty kick from Zinedine Zidane with three minutes to play in
overtime Wednesday to reach the finals of the European
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   And Portugal's artful, spectactular run to the semis culminated
in ugly fashion in Brussels as Austrian referee Gunther Benko
called a handball in the box against defender Abel Xavier.
</P>
<P>
   Replays showed that Xavier, guarding the near post, did little
to move his left arm out of the way of a short shot by France's
Sylvain Wiltord on the touchline.
</P>
<P>
   Both before and after Zidane made the conversion for a 2-1
victory, angry Portuguese players charged Benko en masse, resulting
in a red card for striker Nuno Gomes. He had put Portugal ahead 1-0
in the 19th minute on a 20-footer that surprised French keeper
Fabien Barthez.
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes into the second half, Thierry Henry drew France even
on a feed from Nicolas Anelka, and the match continued with the
same dogged, defensive shape it had taken from the outset. Neither
Zidane nor Luis Figo of Portugal, perhaps the two best players in
the tournament, got the kind of creative space to which they are
accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   The French can become the first team to win back-to-back World
Cup and European titles when they face either Holland or Italy
Sunday in Rotterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's best international finish since losing in the Euro
'84 semis _ ironically to France by a 2-1 score in the last minute
of play _ also was the end of the line for coach Humberto Coelho,
who announced his resignation to reporters after the match.
</P>
<P>
   _Holland vs. Italy
</P>
<P>
   In today's other semifinal in Amsterdam, host Holland is favored
over defense-minded Italy. But the Dutch will be without left
fullback Arthur Numan, who has an injured foot, and goalkeeper
Edwin van der Sar isn't 100 percent, either. The Italians are
playing better than their pre-Euro form suggested. They have
conceded only two goals, although they haven't seen a team with the
offensive firepower of the Dutch. Patrick Kluivert, officially
credited with three goals in a 6-1 quarterfinal rout of Yugoslavia,
and Dennis Bergkamp are lethal on the attack, with Edgar Davids,
Marc Overmars, Philip Cocu and Boudewijn Zenden forming an
exceptional midfield behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Italy has some injury concerns as well, although defenders Paolo
Maldini and Fabio Cannavaro are expected to play. The unheralded
offensive trio of Stefano Fiore, Francesco Totti and Filippo
Inzaghi has performed admirably to get this far. Don't be surprised
if their best is enough to pull off an upset.
</P>
<P>
   _Germany: Daum job denied
</P>
<P>
   The Deutsche Fussball Bund, the German federation, is denying
media reports that Bayer Leverkusen manager Christophe Daum has
agreed to take over the national team. The Mitteldeutsche Zeitung
reported over the weekend that Daum would coach both teams until
after the 2000-01 Bundesliga season and then assume German team
duties full-time. Daum is one of the leading candidates, along with
Bayern Munich's Ottmar Hitzfeld, to succeed Erich Ribbeck, who
stepped down after Germany was ousted in group play in Euro 2000 in
its worst tournament showing in 16 years. Bayer management is
accusing the DFB of heavy-handed tactics in trying to lure Daum....
Sweeper Lothar Matthaus is claiming, after the fact, that teammates
Jens Jeremies, Markus Babbel and Dietmar Hamann were plotting a
coup to replace Ribbeck with Matthaus before Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
   _Boca wins Libertadores
</P>
<P>
   Defending South American club champions Palmeiras of Brazil were
dethroned 4-2 on penalty kicks last week in the finals of the Copa
Libertadores. Boca Juniors of Argentina won the title for the third
time. The teams played to a 2-2 aggreggate. Then, Boca goalkeeper
Cordoba stopped spot kicks by Faustino Asprilla and Roque Junior. .
. . Sao Paulo won its 18th Paulista state championship last week,
while Flamengo upset Vasco da Gama to take the Carioca title for
Rio de Janeiro state. . . . Argentina is at Colombia tonight in the
featured match as a full round of South American World Cup
qualifying continues. Paraguay travels to Chile and Peru is at
Ecuador. Brazil met Uruguay and Venezuela faced Bolivia late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   _Transfer talk: Alfonso might stay put
</P>
<P>
   After starring for Spain in Euro 2000, striker Alfonso Perez
faces the prospect of playing second-division club soccer. That's
because Real Betis, relegated from La Liga, has no plans to ship
him off. And any suitors would have to pay $45 million, the cost of
the buy-out clause in his contract. . . . French striker David
Trezeguet is moving from first division champions AS Monaco to
Juventus. . . . Scottish Premier League player of the year Mark
Viduka, who scored 27 goals for Celtic, is set to transfer to
Leeds, where he will be reunited with fellow Australian Harry
Kewell. . . . After a season at Inter Milan, former Italian
goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi is headed to Serie A champions Lazio,
which paid $28 million.

IN PRESS CONFERENCE, CLINTON TRIES TO BOOST GORE

 By DAVID E. SANGER and MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton turned an hourlong news
conference Wednesday into an effort to bolster Vice President Al
Gore's campaign and to defend him from accusations of campaign
finance irregularities, saying Gore made ``a compelling case'' that
he did nothing wrong and arguing that the ``so-called scandals'' of
the past eight years ``were bogus.''
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging discussion that ran the gamut from gasoline
prices to the death penalty to missile defense to Elian Gonzalez to
prescription drug coverage to how much brain power it takes to be
president, Clinton invoked Gore's name more than a dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed polls showing Gore running behind Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas _ noting that this week alone one poll showed a
13-point lead for the presumed Republican candidate while another
indicated a virtual tie. The president said that once Americans
examine Gore's record, his economic policy and his understanding of
new technology, ``it's still more likely than not that he will
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he did not see a need for Attorney General Janet
Reno to appoint a special counsel to investigate Gore's involvement
in campaign fund raising, including his appearance at a Buddhist
temple in California in April 1996. He said she had already
considered, and rejected, an outside review and that ``the best
thing to do is for the American people to make their own judgments
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he seized the moment _ as he does increasingly often these
days _ to argue that his White House has been repeatedly vindicated
of wrongdoing despite a Washington ``scandal machine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The word `scandal' has been thrown around here like a clanging
teapot for seven years,'' he said. And he quickly cited a
Washington Post column that he said concluded ``a whole bunch of
this stuff was just garbage, and that we had totally innocent
people prosecuted because they wouldn't lie.'' He cited numerous
investigations of his Cabinet members, and of his own financial
dealings in Arkansas, but never mentioned his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The president also plugged Gore when asked about the brain power
needed to be a good president and gently tweaked Bush, who has said
he plans to surround himself with the best advisers to compensate
for areas in which he is not an expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's so much a question of intelligence
generically,'' Clinton said in describing the qualities it takes to
be president. ``I mean, I think it's more a question of curiosity
and willingness to learn what you think is important,'' a clear
reference to suggestions that Bush often skims the surface rather
than delving deeply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I think that no president can say, well, it should be
enough for the voters if I get the best advisers in my party and
they come up with a position and I take it,'' he added. ``So what
the voters will have to analyze here is how important is the fact
that Al Gore spent 20 years working on arms control issues, for
example, and dealing with all these things?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent most of his time pressing the legislative agenda
for his last seven months in office. He urged Congress to take the
deal he offered this week: prescription drug coverage for senior
citizens, a longtime item on Clinton's list, in return for the
elimination of the ``marriage penalty'' in the tax system, a
longtime Republican desire.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the Senate to approve permanent normal trade relations
with China, as the House has already. ``I ask Congress, let's not
waste these precious weeks,'' he said. But his advisers acknowledge
that Clinton would be lucky to get one or two of his priorities
through an election-year Congress, and say he will focus instead on
negotiating an Israeli-Palestinian peace by September, and other
foreign policy initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about capital punishment, Clinton expressed concern about
racial disparities among those facing execution for federal crimes.
Seventeen of the 21 federal prisoners facing the death penalty are
members of minority groups. Clinton also said he was concerned that
prosecutors in a dozen Southern states have accounted for more than
half of the federal cases in which the death penalty has been
sought.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments gave some hope to lawyers for Juan Raul
Garza, a migrant farm worker convicted of marijuana smuggling and
three drug-related murders who is scheduled next month to become
the first person facing a federal execution in nearly 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're encouraged by the president's comments,'' said Gregory
Wiercioch, a lawyer with the Texas Defender Service who is
representing Garza and preparing to file a request for clemency.
``What President Clinton is realizing is that the Justice
Department's authorization is like a rigged lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's news conference came shortly after the Supreme Court
handed down a series of high-profile rulings, and Clinton fielded
questions on many of them, from the court's refusal to hear a case
dealing with Elian Gonzalez _ who left Washington for Cuba only
hours after Clinton spoke _ to its decision backing the Boy Scouts'
ability to exclude gay members.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wished the return of Elian to Cuba had ``unfolded in
a less dramatic, less traumatic way for all concerned.'' He made a
last-minute offer to the departing family: ``If he and his father
decided they wanted to stay here, it would be fine with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton signaled no major departure from the U.S. embargo on
Cuba, saying it would be up to Cuban President Fidel Castro to
reach out to the United States. He deflected comparisons to his
recent decision to lift the embargo of commercial exchanges against
North Korea _ despite the fact that the North Korean regime had
engaged in atrocities closely paralleling those he accused Castro
of committing.
</P>
<P>
   While he said he supported the notion of selling U.S. food and
medicine to Havana, the substance of a deal struck this week among
House congressional leaders, the president said he was concerned
about restrictions in the legislation on travel to the island.
</P>
<P>
   On the court's decision to permit the Boy Scouts to bar gays,
Clinton called the scouts, of which he is honorary president, ``a
great group.'' But he said he hopes the decision is ``just one step
along the way of a movement toward greater inclusion in our society
because I think that's the direction we ought to be going in.''

NETWORKS DEVOTE HOURS TO CUBAN BOY'S DEPARTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CUBAN-BOY) 
 By BILL CARTER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The departure of Elian Gonzalez for Cuba on Wednesday afternoon
received extensive live coverage from every television news
organization, with the all-news cable channels devoting most of
five straight hours to the story.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of the private jet taking Elian back to Havana was
covered by ABC News, CBS News and NBC News as well, all of which
interrupted regular programming for about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The news coverage began shortly after noon, when the Supreme
Court announced that it had declined to intervene in the case. The
coverage included reports from Havana, Washington and Miami, where
Cuban-Americans were still protesting the decision that allowed
Juan Miguel Gonzalez to take his son back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   On the three all-news cable channels, CNN, MSNBC and Fox News,
the afternoon included a long period of live helicopter coverage of
the Gonzalez family in a white van heading for Dulles International
Airport near Washington. The coverage was visually similar to the
infamous white Bronco chase at the start of the almost
around-the-clock coverage of the O.J. Simpson murder case in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   As one CNN executive put it, ``I don't want to call it a Bronco
but it certainly looked like a Bronco.'' Steve Capus, the executive
producer of special coverage for MSNBC, said, ``It was certainly
reminiscent of live events the country has watched in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Eason Jordan, the president of news-gathering for CNN, said,
``People expect us to be on top of every breaking story. This is a
story that involved President Clinton, Vice President Gore,
Attorney General Reno, Congress and the Supreme Court and has had
impact on Cuban-American relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Capus said MSNBC had devoted time to President Clinton's news
conference, as well as the Supreme Court's decisions on partial
birth abortion and gays in the Boy Scouts. But much of the day was
devoted to coverage of the Gonzalez departure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the cable news business, a day like this is what we live
for,'' Capus said.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said CNN, the only news channel with a permanent bureau
in Havana, would continue to cover whatever developments took place
in Cuba. ``Elian Gonzalez is probably the most famous child on the
face of the earth,'' Jordan said. ``Beyond the policy issues it is
also obviously a great human interest story.''

 &HT;    ELIAN, FAMILY RETURN TO CUBA FOLLOWING MONTHS-LONG AMERICAN
ODYSSEY
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Nearly seven months to the day after he was plucked from
the sea, 6-year-old rafter Elian Gonzalez jetted home to Cuba with
his family Wednesday, ending a remarkable saga that tugged at
heartstrings and stirred intense political debate the world over.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear a legal
appeal by his Miami relatives who wanted to keep him in the United
States, Elian and his immediate family climbed aboard a small
chartered jet at Dulles International Airport outside Washington,
D.C. for their flight to Havana. The plane took off at about 4:42
p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy to be going home,'' Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, told reporters in broken English shortly before boarding
the jet with his second wife, infant son and Elian. ``I'd like to
thank the North American government for finally giving me my son
back after all my family's suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   The jet arrived at Jose Marti International Airport in Havana at
7:45 p.m. ET. Stepping onto the tarmac, Elian was smothered with
hugs and kisses from grandparents and other family members as more
than 100 schoolchildren wearing uniforms cheered and waved Cuban
flags.
</P>
<P>
   Within 10 minutes, the family boarded a small white car and
drove away, with Elian waving out the opened window.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government _ which discouraged many U.S. journalists
from traveling to Havana to cover the homecoming _ insisted there
would be no large public celebrations, urging the Cuban people to
remain calm.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports that the family would stay for several weeks
at a secluded diplomatic compound in the Havana suburb of Miramar.
Later in the summer, they will take a vacation and then return
their home in Cardenas, about a two hours from Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives made no public appearances Wednesday,
and angrily confronted a Miami television reporter who filmed them
outside a Coconut Grove Church shortly after the Supreme Court
decision was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are devastated that at this very moment, Elian is going
back to a country where he'll never be free,'' family spokesman
Armando Gutierrez said. ``This is a very rough time for us, but we
must obey the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian leaves behind a tangled legacy of warring lawyers, feuding
family members and hard feelings among Cuban exiles here, who
adopted his case as a symbol of their bitter hatred for Castro's
communist dictatorship. As Elian boarded the jet in Washington, a
few dozen somber Cuban exiles gathered outside the Little Havana
home where the boy lived for five months with his Miami relatives.
Many had tears streaming down their faces, while others held up
their hands in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came for the boy at gunpoint, that's the scary part,''
said Ruth Dupree, 27, a second-generation Cuban-American. ``This
family that did so much for him never got to say good-bye. It's
shaken my faith in America.''
</P>
<P>
   At a press briefing in Washington, President Clinton said he
regretted that the case became so politically charged, although he
said it would have been fine if Elian and his father had decided to
stay in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno _ who became a lightning rod of
criticism for her handling of the case _ applauded the Supreme
Court's decision not to hear the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``All involved have had an opportunity to make their case _ all
the way to the highest court in the land,'' Reno said. ``I hope
that everyone will accept the Supreme Court's decision and join me
in wishing this family, and this special little boy, well.''
</P>
<P>
   With his impish grin and photogenic face, Elian captured the
hearts of millions, especially after they heard the harrowing story
of how his mother and 10 others drowned while trying to escape from
Cuba. Elian was found alone, floating in an inner-tube a few miles
offshore the Florida coast on Thanksgiving Day last year.
</P>
<P>
   With the initial blessing of his father and the U.S. government,
Elian was taken in by his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, a Little
Havana mechanic who left Cuba more than 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the family's early relief that Elian had survived quickly
dissolved into acrimony over where the boy should live.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials took until early January to rule that Elian
should be returned to his father in Cuba, a decision that sparked a
day of angry protests in Miami. The Miami family quickly filed a
federal lawsuit aimed at winning Elian an asylum hearing and the
right to remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In late January, the boy's two Cuban grandmothers traveled to
the United States _ and briefly to Miami to see the boy _ in an
unsuccessful bid to take Elian home. Their visit only seemed to
feed the rancorous debate over the boy's future.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, Castro turned Elian into a cause celebre, staging
massive public rallies and marches that attracted hundreds of
thousands who chanted and sang for his return.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a Miami federal judge ruled that Elian should go home
with his father, triggering the Miami family's immediate appeal to
the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the dramatic arrival of Juan Miguel Gonzalez from Cuba
in early April, sparking a new round of demands _ and a wave of
support from the American public _ that the boy be turned over to
his father pending the court appeal. After several weeks of
frustrating negotiations, Reno ordered a pre-dawn raid on April 22
to forcibly take the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The raid triggered outrage and a day of angry protests in Miami,
along with uneasiness among many Americans shocked by a news photo
of a terrified Elian being snatched by a gun-wielding agent.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling soon subsided, however, after Elian was reunited
with his father in the Washington area and subsequent photos of the
smiling boy were released. He spent the next two months living
mostly in seclusion, awaiting the outcome of the court case.
</P>
<P>
   On June 1, the Atlanta appeals court ruled against the Miami
relatives; then reaffirmed its decision on June 23.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-ditch effort, the Miami relatives asked the Supreme
Court to hear the case, but were rebuffed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the case that captured the attention of U.S. presidential
candidates and is cited as a factor in an apparent deal in Congress
to ease the embargo against Cuba is finally over.
</P>
<P>
   But it will clearly never be forgotten in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible,'' said Ana Vega, 27, a Cuban-American
schoolteacher. ``It's just publicity for Castro. In his eyes, he
beat the American government. They gave in to that evil, horrible
man.''

   HOMEWORK HELP FROM AN EXPERT  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When 9-year-old B.J. Pinchbeck could not find a good Web site to
help him with his science project, he and his father decided to
build one. Four years later, B.J. Pinchbeck's Homework Helper
(www.bjpinchbeck.com) has become an indispensable bookmark for many
middle-schoolers and their parents. The site, operated by
DiscoverySchool.com, has amassed more than 580 links organized by
subject and B.J. has become a kind of Stephen Jay Gould for
preteen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. is now 13, an age at which popularity can be a double-edged
sword. He receives between 20 and 40 e-mail messages a day asking
for help, even on days when he would rather be in-line skating or
playing Age of Empires online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard,'' he said. ``It's getting frustrating,
particularly in the summer.'' The reach of the Web means that he
now gets e-mail from countries where students do not get a
two-month vacation. His father reminds him, he is receiving a lot
more e-mail from American students in summer school. ``Yes,'' he
said a little wearily. ``That's another thing we have to
consider.''
</P>
<P>
   IT TAKES ONE TO TANGO ON THIS SITE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By day, Larry Carroll works as a software engineer at the Boeing
Co., putting animated figures through their paces in 3-D replicas
of cockpits and workspaces. But Carroll's heart belongs on the
dance floor. A longtime dancer, he saw his first tango class 11
years ago and, he says, fell in love. Four years ago, he wrote an
online manual
(home.att.net/(tilde)larrydla/basics(underscore)O.html) to teach
the tango to a wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tango is kind of like a polymorphic character that depends
on the viewers and what they want,'' he says. ``It can be very
technical, but it can also be very simple and intimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, 58, grew up in Texas, where his uncle ran a honky-tonk:
``I learned swing, the two-step and the cowboy stuff at a very
early age.'' After the Air Force and an early career in television
production, his interest in software took him to NASA and then to
Boeing. Of course, he kept dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most good engineers also have a strong creative bent,'' he
says. ``Otherwise, they would just be plodders.'' He has just added
a new page to his site for people who want to learn the steps in
just one minute. He has called it, with an engineer's precision,
``0 to Tango in 60 Seconds.''

   ACCIDENTAL JOURNALIST: A TEEN-AGER FINDS A VOCATION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tameeka Mitchem remembers her first foray into journalism as
something of a disaster. In April 1999, she volunteered to work for
Harlem Live, a nonprofit Web site (http://www.harlemlive.org)
produced by New York teen-agers. When another reporter could not
make a scheduled interview at a local community organization,
Tameeka went instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so nervous, and that's weird because I'm not a nervous
person,'' she said. ``I was reading the information in the cab on
the way over. I think I asked one question three times.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, Tameeka was Harlem Live's editor in chief,
helping to manage the Web site's staff of more than 30. The site,
created in the mid-'90s, publishes news and features concerning
Harlem, mostly on community-based organizations that, she said,
``don't get all that much attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Tameeka was not interested in being a reporter or an editor when

 &HT;    ELIAN, FAMILY RETURN TO CUBA FOLLOWING MONTHS-LONG AMERICAN
ODYSSEY
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Nearly seven months to the day after he was plucked from
the sea, 6-year-old rafter Elian Gonzalez jetted home to Cuba with
his family Wednesday, ending a remarkable saga that tugged at
heartstrings and stirred intense political debate the world over.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear a legal
appeal by his Miami relatives who wanted to keep him in the United
States, Elian and his immediate family climbed aboard a small
chartered jet at Dulles International Airport outside Washington,
D.C. for their flight to Havana. The plane took off at about 4:42
p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy to be going home,'' Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, told reporters in broken English shortly before boarding
the jet with his second wife, infant son and Elian. ``I'd like to
thank the North American government for finally giving me my son
back after all my family's suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   The jet arrived at Jose Marti International Airport in Havana at
7:45 p.m. ET. Stepping onto the tarmac, Elian was smothered with
hugs and kisses from grandparents and other family members as more
than 100 schoolchildren wearing uniforms cheered and waved Cuban
flags.
</P>
<P>
   Within 10 minutes, the family boarded a small white car and
drove away, with Elian waving out the opened window.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government _ which discouraged many U.S. journalists
from traveling to Havana to cover the homecoming _ insisted there
would be no large public celebrations, urging the Cuban people to
remain calm.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports that the family would stay for several weeks
at a secluded diplomatic compound in the Havana suburb of Miramar.
Later in the summer, they will take a vacation and then return
their home in Cardenas, about a two hours from Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives made no public appearances Wednesday,
and angrily confronted a Miami television reporter who filmed them
outside a Coconut Grove Church shortly after the Supreme Court
decision was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are devastated that at this very moment, Elian is going
back to a country where he'll never be free,'' family spokesman
Armando Gutierrez said. ``This is a very rough time for us, but we
must obey the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian leaves behind a tangled legacy of warring lawyers, feuding
family members and hard feelings among Cuban exiles here, who
adopted his case as a symbol of their bitter hatred for Castro's
communist dictatorship. As Elian boarded the jet in Washington, a
few dozen somber Cuban exiles gathered outside the Little Havana
home where the boy lived for five months with his Miami relatives.
Many had tears streaming down their faces, while others held up
their hands in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came for the boy at gunpoint, that's the scary part,''
said Ruth Dupree, 27, a second-generation Cuban-American. ``This
family that did so much for him never got to say good-bye. It's
shaken my faith in America.''
</P>
<P>
   At a press briefing in Washington, President Clinton said he
regretted that the case became so politically charged, although he
said it would have been fine if Elian and his father had decided to
stay in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno _ who became a lightning rod of
criticism for her handling of the case _ applauded the Supreme
Court's decision not to hear the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``All involved have had an opportunity to make their case _ all
the way to the highest court in the land,'' Reno said. ``I hope
that everyone will accept the Supreme Court's decision and join me
in wishing this family, and this special little boy, well.''
</P>
<P>
   With his impish grin and photogenic face, Elian captured the
hearts of millions, especially after they heard the harrowing story
of how his mother and 10 others drowned while trying to escape from
Cuba. Elian was found alone, floating in an inner-tube a few miles
offshore the Florida coast on Thanksgiving Day last year.
</P>
<P>
   With the initial blessing of his father and the U.S. government,
Elian was taken in by his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, a Little
Havana mechanic who left Cuba more than 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the family's early relief that Elian had survived quickly
dissolved into acrimony over where the boy should live.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials took until early January to rule that Elian
should be returned to his father in Cuba, a decision that sparked a
day of angry protests in Miami. The Miami family quickly filed a
federal lawsuit aimed at winning Elian an asylum hearing and the
right to remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In late January, the boy's two Cuban grandmothers traveled to
the United States _ and briefly to Miami to see the boy _ in an
unsuccessful bid to take Elian home. Their visit only seemed to
feed the rancorous debate over the boy's future.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, Castro turned Elian into a cause celebre, staging
massive public rallies and marches that attracted hundreds of
thousands who chanted and sang for his return.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a Miami federal judge ruled that Elian should go home
with his father, triggering the Miami family's immediate appeal to
the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the dramatic arrival of Juan Miguel Gonzalez from Cuba
in early April, sparking a new round of demands _ and a wave of
support from the American public _ that the boy be turned over to
his father pending the court appeal. After several weeks of
frustrating negotiations, Reno ordered a pre-dawn raid on April 22
to forcibly take the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The raid triggered outrage and a day of angry protests in Miami,
along with uneasiness among many Americans shocked by a news photo
of a terrified Elian being snatched by a gun-wielding agent.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling soon subsided, however, after Elian was reunited
with his father in the Washington area and subsequent photos of the
smiling boy were released. He spent the next two months living
mostly in seclusion, awaiting the outcome of the court case.
</P>
<P>
   On June 1, the Atlanta appeals court ruled against the Miami
relatives; then reaffirmed its decision on June 23.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-ditch effort, the Miami relatives asked the Supreme
Court to hear the case, but were rebuffed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the case that captured the attention of U.S. presidential
candidates and is cited as a factor in an apparent deal in Congress
to ease the embargo against Cuba is finally over.
</P>
<P>
   But it will clearly never be forgotten in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible,'' said Ana Vega, 27, a Cuban-American
schoolteacher. ``It's just publicity for Castro. In his eyes, he
beat the American government. They gave in to that evil, horrible
man.''

&HT;     COURT REJECTS NEBRASKA LAW BANNING LATE-TERM ABORTIONS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rekindling a bitter debate over women's rights to
end their pregnancies, the Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down a
Nebraska law banning late-term procedures that opponents call
``partial-birth'' abortions.
</P>
<P>
   In its most important decision on the subject in eight years,
the court ruled 5-4 that the law imposed an ``undue burden'' on a
woman's right to use the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen Breyer, writing for the court, said the state's
late-term-abortion law actually covers two types of abortion
techniques, both performed in the second trimester of a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The better known _ and more controversial _ is called dilation
and extraction (D&AMP;X), in which the fetus is pulled feet first
through the cervix and the skull is punctured and its contents
drained. The procedure is most often used between the 19th and 24th
week of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The lesser known procedure, performed mostly between the 16th
and 22nd weeks, is called an intact dilation and evacuation (D&AMP;E),
in which fetal and placental tissue are dismembered and removed.
</P>
<P>
   It was the D&AMP;X procedure that the Nebraska legislature was
attempting to stop. But Breyer said the statute was so broad that
it also could be used to bar D&AMP;Es, which many doctors consider
safer.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer said banning the D&AMP;E procedure could place a women's
health at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those who perform abortion procedures using that method
must fear prosecution, conviction and imprisonment (resulting in)
an undue burden upon a woman's right to make an abortion
decision,'' Breyer said. ``We must consequently find the statute
unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Breyer were Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sandra Day O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, who supplied the critical fifth vote for striking down
Nebraska's law, wrote a concurring opinion that offered some
guidance on what type of late-term-abortion law might be
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ban on partial-birth abortion that only proscribed the D&AMP;X
method of abortion and that included an exception to preserve the
life and health of the mother would be constitutional in my view,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision produced both political and legal
shock waves.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the court decision ``was the only
decision that could be reached consistent with Roe v. Wade,'' the
1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the next president is likely to choose two to four
Supreme Court justices and ``depending on who they are,'' abortion
rights are ``very much in the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who has focused on the high court's
makeup as a key issue, said such ``razor-thin'' decisions could be
reversed if Texas Gov. George W. Bush wins the presidency and names
more conservative justices. ``The presidential election will decide
the future of the Supreme Court and that in turn will decide
whether or not we keep a woman's right to choose _ or see it taken
away,'' he said on a campaign stop in Blacklick, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, also campaigning in Ohio, said he was ``disappointed'' in
the ruling and that he felt states should have the right to pass
laws that ban the ``brutal practice of partial-birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people can take steps to protect children who are
in the process of being born, and they should have that right,'' he
said in a statement. ``And, unlike Al Gore, I pledge to fight for a
ban on partial-birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., hailed the decision as a major
victory for women's right to make ``private, personal'' decisions
about her body. ``Today women's health prevailed over extremism,''
Boxer said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., chairman of the House Republican
Conference, said, ``I look forward to the day when a Republican
president will replace retiring liberals with justices who will
truthfully interpret the Constitution rather than impose their
activist views against states and the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the court's dissenters _ Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas
_ two questioned whether Nebraska and 29 other states with similar
statutes could rewrite their laws to conform to Wednesday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a co-author of the last major abortion ruling in 1992
that upheld abortion rights but allowed some state restrictions,
wrote in a dissent joined by Rehnquist that ``Justice O'Connor
assures the people of Nebraska they are free to redraft the law.
The assurance is meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that including a ``health of the mother'' exception
to late-term abortion laws would award ``each physician a veto
power over the state's judgment that the procedures should not be
performed.''
</P>
<P>
   A late-term abortion bill is pending in the Republican-led
Congress, but Clinton has promised to veto it, as he did with
similar measures in 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska's 1997 law was challenged as unconstitutional by Dr.
Leroy Carhart, one of only three doctors in the state known to
perform abortions and the only one who performed them after 16
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the court agreed that the law was too broad and placed
an ``undue burden'' on Carhart and his patients.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis
agreed, saying the law would result in banning a number of common
abortion techniques used in the second trimester. Similar laws in
20 other states have been struck down in federal courts as
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   However, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago upheld the
bans in Illinois and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the high court affirmed the decision of the 8th
Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Carhart, who sat in the high court chamber Wednesday, said
afterward, ``This is a victory for all Americans who believe that
the government must not be allowed to meddle in the private
decisions best left to women, their families and their doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   In another abortion-related decision, the court gave states
greater leeway to restrict anti-abortion demonstrations outside
health clinics
</P>
<P>
   Saying the right to avoid ``unwanted communication'' sometimes
outweighs free-speech rights, the justices by a 6-3 vote upheld
Colorado's limits on antiabortion protesters' so-called ``sidewalk
counseling'' of patients who coming to clinics where abortions are
performed. Dissenters were Scalia, Thomas and Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Colorado has enforced its ``bubble'' law that
prohibits people from counseling, distributing leaflets or
displaying signs within 8 feet of others without their consent
whenever they are within 100 feet of a clinic entrance.

ON TV, IT'S RAINING CATS AND DOGS, NOT TO MENTION POTBELLIED PIGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM RUTENBERG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The newest crop of television stars are devoid of ego, blind
ambition and agents who request astronomical salaries. They don't
undermine their co-stars, and their so-called friends don't go
blabbing to the tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   No, a new age of decorum has not dawned in the television world.
The new stars are animals: Dogs, cats, crocodiles, snakes, turtles
and even giant squid.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the animals play other animals (a dog named Howard is
the new Lassie). Others are on trial (like those on ``Judge
Wapner's Animal Court''). Others undergo surgery (on ``Emergency
Vets''). Many are just being themselves while being stalked by
indefatigable humans (``Crocodile Hunter'' and ``Jack Hanna's
Animal Adventures'').
</P>
<P>
   After years of relative scarcity, shows about animals are
multiplying: Some two dozen can now be found on television. And
they are being watched by ever larger audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started eight years ago, there were three or four
animal shows on television,'' Hanna said. ``Now _ golly day! It's
hard to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, two shows about extinct creatures on the
Discovery Channel have drawn the largest audiences ever for cable
programs other than sports or news. ``Walking with Dinosaurs,''
which used computer graphics to create the world of the dinosaurs,
was watched by 10.7 million people. ``Raising the Mammoth,'' a
documentary tracking an expedition that unearthed a wooly mammoth,
was watched by 10.1 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Animal Planet, a cable network that features programs about
animals 24 hours a day, is the fastest-growing channel on cable
television, now reaching 60 million households, or 60 percent of
those with televisions. On a good night, its audience size is equal
to or greater than Larry King's on CNN. This fall National
Geographic will start up its own cable channel, with a large
percentage of its programming focusing on the animal kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical day, the majority of cable subscribers are offered
32 hours of animals. The Learning Channel, the Pax network and even
CNBC, the financial network, offer wildlife programs, as PBS has
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   But the genre has changed. In the 1960s and '70s nature
programming typically offered the heavy monotone of a narrator with
instructional shots from Africa, India or other faraway places, as
in ``Wild Kingdom'' and ``The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau.''
</P>
<P>
   Later came programs centering on fights to the death _ in the
trade, ``fang television'' _ and offerings like the Fox network's
``When Good Pets Go Bad,'' which served up videos of snarling pets
turning on their masters.
</P>
<P>
   The new programs are livelier than the early vintage and less
violent than the fang-heavy ones. They feature colorful hosts and
include more close-up photography. They seek to educate and
entertain at the same time. And they are heavily promoted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of the material has progressively gotten better,''
said Larry Gerbrandt, a media analyst with Paul Kagan Associates,
which follows programming trends. ``The footage has gotten more
exciting and networks like Discovery and Animal Planet have really
figured out how to generate ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   Television programmers, media analysts like Gerbrandt and
academic experts attribute the resurgence to the expanding array of
cable channels; the relatively low costs of making wildlife
documentaries, which are now shot with vastly improved cameras; and
the growing adoration for nonhumans of every stripe.
</P>
<P>
   The animal genre ``couldn't compete in a network world,'' said
Jeff Sagansky, president of the Pax network, which recently added
reruns of Hanna's ``Animal Adventures'' to its daily schedule.
``But it can compete in more of a niche world,'' he said of the new
universe of cable, digital cable, satellite TV and smaller
broadcast networks like Pax.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller networks crave original programming that they can
call their own, but they do not have a lot of money for the
writers, producers, crews and actors. The wildlife shows require
only a small staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, these animals have not been signed by Aftra, so you
don't pay residuals,'' Sagansky joked, in a reference to the
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.
</P>
<P>
   The programs are also attractive to parents troubled by
increasingly racy network shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a safe harbor on the dial,'' said Clark Bunting,
president of Animal Planet. ``People are looking for the
opportunity to do something as a family and not have the kids on
the computer, dad watching sports and mom watching something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunting said that the programs were also simply good television,
produced with the goal of entertainment. ``A typical show used to
be about lions in the Serengeti, and the story was about the alpha
male and the beta female and all that sort of thing,'' Bunting
said. ``Now, people have used elements of story to hook the viewers
and bring them in.''
</P>
<P>
   Animal Planet's No. 1 lure is Steve Irwin, host of ``The
Crocodile Hunter,'' the network's top-rated program, which is
regularly shown on Sunday and Wednesday nights and is watched in an
average of 400,000 households. Its popularity led Animal Planet
executives to run the show every night from June 18-24 in what was
heavily promoted as ``Croc Week.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two nights' programs brought Planet's highest
prime-time ratings ever. The June 18 edition of ``Crocodile
Hunter'' was watched by more than one million viewers, the largest
audience in the channel's four-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, known for his thick Australian accent and khaki outfits,
seems to regularly court death in the program as he roves the
swamps of Florida, the Australian outback and Sumatra in search of
crocodiles and any other large and dangerous animal he can come
upon.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent episode, he jumped into a river and wrestled a
``crocker'' into submission with his bare hands. In another, while
visiting the Komodo dragons of Komodo Island, Irwin wound up being
chased by one that bit into the back of his boot as he scurried up
a tree. He caught his breath and excitedly told the camera, ``This
is a great demonstration of how dangerous they are!''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin has been the subject of a ``Saturday Night Live'' skit, is
negotiating a movie deal and will soon have his own action figure.
</P>
<P>
   Helping the nature genre as a whole is a new generation of small
video cameras that capture shots that would have been impossible
even a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Bunting said, ``you can fly in formation with Canada
geese, and your sense of perspective, as a viewer is you think that
you're a goose.''
</P>
<P>
   The network's other defining show, ``Emergency Vets,'' focuses
on the animals rushed to the Alameda East Veterinary Hospital in
Colorado. A typical scene: Zorro, a potbellied pig who rides a
skateboard in a traveling animal show, eats some plastic, which
causes an infection in an upper molar on the left side of his
mouth. The infection spreads to his sinus system and causes his
head to swell. The vets extract the tooth and give him antibiotics,
and Zorro is free to perform again.
</P>
<P>
   Akira Matsuka Lippit, a professor of cinema at San Francisco
State University, suggests that the current animal craze has a
broader explanation than intense interest in snakes and potbellied
pigs. He links it to a sweep of technological advances that are
distancing people from simpler ways of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a rapid increase in a kind of technologization of the
culture and there is perhaps a desperate attempt to reconnect the
human body and existence to a certain kind of animal, and natural,
state,'' said Lippit, author of the recent book ``Electric Animal:
Toward a Rhetoric of Wildlife'' (University of Minnesota Press).
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Rollin, a professor of philosophy and physiology at the
University of Colorado who has written extensively on the
relationship between animals and society, said the programs'
popularity might also be related to urbanization.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are fascinated by animals because we're removed from
animals,'' Rollin said. Such programs give humans a glimpse of
natural phenomena that their very distant ancestors lived with
every day, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Within the television industry, there is nonetheless a concern
that animal programming is reaching a saturation point. ``I'm sure
some of them are going to be weeded out,'' said Hanna.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he said, it will come down to the survival of the
fittest.

A SUPREME COURT NOT EASY TO TYPECAST

<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ You would think that in an election year, the
Supreme Court justices might cooperate with popular efforts to
label them liberal or conservative, lining up the big decisions on
a political scorecard. After all, the next president may get to
appoint one or more new members to the court _ three justices are
over 70, four have fought serious illnesses and some might welcome
the chance to retire if the new president were likely to appoint a
sympathetic successor.
</P>
<P>
   But in the rich and important term that they finished Wednesday,
the justices defied any simple political typecasting, proving once
again that the court does not simply follow the election returns,
and that court-packing is harder than it looks.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are several areas _ such as the separation of
church and state and the scope of federal power _ where the court
did divide rigidly into two camps, and in which future outcomes do
hang by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, will the court uphold voucher programs that give
tax money to parochial schools, deciding that they are not, as some
claim, an unconstitutional ``establishment'' of religion in
violation of the First Amendment? A clue came in a 6-3 ruling
holding that the government may grant computers and other teaching
aids to religious schools. Four justices _ Chief Justice William
Rehnquist and Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy _
indicated a likely willingness to uphold voucher schemes, reasoning
in an opinion by Thomas that it is ``bigotry'' to exclude
``pervasively sectarian schools from otherwise permissible aid
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   But these four justices do not yet have a clear fifth vote for
the constitutionality of vouchers. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor went
to great lengths in a separate, but concurring opinion, joined by
Justice Stephen Breyer, to caution that the court must still review
aid programs carefully to make sure they do not support too much
religious indoctrination.
</P>
<P>
   The power of Congress to enact broad civil rights laws also
hangs in a 5-4 balance. Earlier this year, the court threw out a
federal lawsuit by a young woman claiming damages after date rape
by football players at a state university, and a lawsuit by
employees claiming age discrimination by a state employer,
reasoning in each case that Congress had overstepped its authority
in allowing such suits.
</P>
<P>
   Five justices _ Rehnquist, Scalia, O'Connor, Kennedy and Thomas
_ have consistently voted for such restrictions of federal power;
four _ Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer _ would give more
latitude to Congress. The presidential election could tip this
balance.
</P>
<P>
   But in a wide range of other decisions this term, the justices
declined to march in neat political lockstep. If the court had
voted according to the popular stereotypes of ``liberal'' and
``conservative'' judges, Ginsburg and Breyer, who were appointed by
President Clinton, would not have disagreed on whether the
Constitution's prohibition on retroactive laws required the court
to overturn the conviction of a child molester.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would Scalia, a ``conservative,'' have had occasion on
Monday to lecture the more ``liberal'' Breyer on the importance of
an undiminished right to trial by jury for a defendant accused of a
hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the justices do not vote along simple ideological
lines results in unexpected coalitions. For instance, Stevens,
Kennedy, Souter and Thomas, all appointed by Republican presidents,
and Ginsburg struck down a law requiring television cable companies
either to completely scramble, or to take off the air, sexually
explicit broadcasts during waking hours. The only other Democrat
appointee, Breyer, joined Rehnquist, O'Connor and Scalia in arguing
that the restrictions were proper.
</P>
<P>
   And dissenting in another case, Scalia and Breyer agreed that
the Constitution allows a federal agent to squeeze bus passengers'
carry-on bags looking for drugs; the other seven justices were
convinced this was an illegal search.
</P>
<P>
   The court's judicial activism last term was also bipartisan. It
ruled two federal laws that might be viewed as conservative to be
unconstitutional: one limiting smut on cable television and the
other giving police more leeway to interrogate suspects without the
straitjacket of Miranda warnings. But also struck down federal laws
against gender-motivated violence and age discrimination by the
states _ both likely to be favored by liberal constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling on state laws, the court struck down ``conservative''
measures that authorized student-led prayers at public high school
football games, gave grandparents broad access to their
grandchildren over a parent's objection and banned so-called
partial-birth abortions. But it also invalidated ``liberal'' state
laws forcing the Boy Scouts to admit a gay scoutmaster and giving
native Hawaiians preferences in voting for officials in charge of
native Hawaiian affairs. And this week, it invalidated the
California primary system, which allowed votes across party lines,
reasoning that a measure favored by political moderates like
Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and Republican Rep. Tom Campbell in fact
violated political parties' freedom of association.
</P>
<P>
   The court's influence over the allocation of power and rights in
our society is profound, and its power well worth reckoning in the
coming election. The president holds sway over not one but two
branches of government _ the executive and the judiciary. But this
term's decisions should make politicians wary of simple ideological
labels.
</P>

STUDIES REVEAL A RUSH OF OLDER WOMEN TO THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By IAN AUSTEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When cartoonists need visual shorthand for the typical American
Web user, they usually come up with an unshaved young man
surrounded by containers that once held various kinds of salty
foods.
</P>
<P>
   But that stereotype does not quite hold true in the United
States and other countries where the Web found an early audience.
``The Web is becoming as mainstream in some ways as television,
CDs, radios and newspapers,'' said Doug McFarland, senior vice
president and general manager at Media Metrix, the Web ratings
firm. It is the job of McFarland and others in the business of
tracking users to determine just how ordinary the Web is becoming.
A comparison of numbers from last year and this shows that, while
the Web is certainly more than the passing fad _ a contemporary
version of the CB radio _ there are still a few surprises in who is
using the Web and how it is being used.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, Web use became balanced between sexes for the
first time this year with 31.1 million men and 31.3 million women
online in April, according to Media Metrix. In some months this
year, McFarland added, female users have significantly outnumbered
their male counterparts. Regardless of how they might think of
themselves, the cold statistical reality of typical Web users is
that they are no longer young.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is now, in fact, very middle aged,'' McFarland said.
``It tends to be used by people in their mid-40s on average. Not
young people who are popping pizza all day.''
</P>
<P>
   The fastest growing group among Web users in the last year in
fact was about as far from the young male stereotype as you can
get: women over 55. Their numbers increased by 84 percent over
1999, hitting 3.19 million in April, according to Media Metrix.
McFarland said that the rush of older women comes about a year
after older men exhibited a similar trend. While many people might
think that every teen-ager in the country is an old Web hand, they
were the group that exhibited the second highest growth rate over
last year in Media Metrix survey, rising just over 80 percent from
April 1999s level.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the rush to use the Web however, are the nation's poor.
``There is still a tremendous digital divide,'' said Allen Weiner,
vice president of analytical services at Neilsen/NetRatings.
Jupiter Research figures show a startling gap between the two
income extremes. Only 21 percent of households with income of less
than $15,000 a year have Web access compared with 78 percent of
those with income over $75,000, despite the drop in the price of a
PC or an Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Web is worldwide in name, it remains mostly an
American phenomenon. The United States has more Web users than the
next 15 countries combined, McFarland said. But only three of the
next six biggest Web using nations _ Canada, Britain and Australia
_ have predominately English speaking populations.
</P>
<P>
   People are also spending more time staring at monitors.
Neilsen/NetRatings measurements show that adult men, for example,
boosted their monthly viewing by two hours over last year, spending
10 hours and 44 minutes using the Web on average last month. In
what appears to be a carry-over from the divide between the sexes
over the use of television remote controls, men also view more
pages than women when using the Web. Nielsen/NetRatings indicates
that they look at, on average, nearly 74 pages an hour when online
compared to 71 for women.
</P>
<P>
   A more dramatic difference can be found hidden on the favorites
or bookmark lists of male and female users. McFarland said that
when Media Metrix took a peek it found that the average man had 60
Web pages bookmarked, and the typical woman had 16. ``Men are more
fickle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner added: ``What was Jerry Seinfeld's greatest line? Men
aren't interested in what's on. They're interested in what else is
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the biggest items on the Web in the last year were
downloadable music _ legal or otherwise _ and shopping. Napster,
the Web-based music file searching and sharing service that has
become the bane of recording industry, was so small in April 1999
that it did not meet Media Metrix's minimum measurement threshold
of 200,000 unique visitors. In April of this year, however, 1.79
million different people visited the site, the company said.
McFarland said the past year also brought growth to Web based radio
but primitive efforts at television have not been particularly
successful.
</P>
<P>
   In shopping, the Boston Consulting Group estimates that North
American online consumer purchases _ including the buying of other
people's cast-offs through auction services like eBay _ will total
$61 billion by the end of 2000. If so, that will be 85 percent more
than the group measured during 1999. Online shopping, like the Web
itself, is becoming increasingly mainstream, said James Vogtle,
e-commerce research director at the Boston Consulting Group, with a
steady stream of major retailers like Kmart's Bluelight.com
increasing their presence on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few areas to show a decline was the amount of time
people spend online at work. In April, according to Media Metrix,
Web users with access only at work spent an average 10 hours and 19
minutes, 10 minutes less than the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner said the estrangement between the Web and the office has
been caused by employers blocking employees' access to streaming
audio and video. EBay and other online auctions, which were once
popular work-time Web destinations, are also being cut off. In
addition, some companies track sites viewed by employees on the job
and the time they spent using them. By comparison, office e-mail
use, which is excluded from Web viewing counts, continued to
increase.
</P>
<P>
   One major attraction of the office PC is the high-speed
connection. Despite all the advertising and media attention given
to cable modems and digital subscriber lines, high-speed consumer
services were used by only 8.8 percent of American home users last
month, according to Neilsen/NetRatings. About 55 percent of Web
users relied on dialup 56K modems. For most Americans, Weiner said,
high speed is either too expensive or too fraught with technical
difficulties to be attractive.
</P>
<P>
   The next big thing on the Web may have little to do with the
medium directly.
</P>
<P>
   McFarland said that a major news event (bigger even than a
Victoria's Secret fashion show) could erase any doubts about the
Web's legitimacy. Perhaps that will happen this year with the
presidential campaigns and the summer Olympic games occurring at a
time of widespread Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   If large numbers of people use the Web to follow those or other
major news events, it will confirm, McFarland said, ``that the
Internet is becoming more of a part of the fabric of peoples'
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the record for the most Web traffic in one day will
still be held by the release of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's
report.

&HT;     SAN ANTONIO ARCHBISHOP KNOWN FOR OPEN-DOOR POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RUDOLPH BUSH and JENNIFER DLOUHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Clergy members are called to reach out to the
troubled. Sometimes, it's a mission that puts them in danger as
they struggle to balance openness and safety.
</P>
<P>
   Recent high-profile violence aimed at religious centers,
including the September 1999 attack on a prayer service in Fort
Worth, Texas, and an August 1999 shooting rampage at a California
Jewish community center, has raised the stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's hostage situation involving Patrick Flores, the
Roman Catholic archbishop of San Antonio, is only the latest in
this series of violent acts that is prompting church officials to
take a look at safety. (The archbishop was released nine hours
after a man seeking help with a passport problem took him hostage.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We do wrestle with the issue of how do we keep our doors open
and how do we protect the lives of the people that work here,''
said Phil Raymond, president of the Alamo Chapter of the National
Association of Church Business Administrators. But though ``the
risks are greater today churches will always err on the side of
(openness).''
</P>
<P>
   The threats are nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three decades ago, a man burst through the doors of the
Cornerstone Church in San Antonio and walked up the aisle, firing a
revolver at the Rev. John Hagee. Every bullet missed, and Hagee
credits God with saving his life.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in March 1999, a pipe bomb sent through the mail and
addressed to Hagee exploded en route from Dallas. No one was hurt,
but the attempt increased Hagee's wariness.
</P>
<P>
   Today, nobody visits his office without first being screened. He
worries, too, when he preaches to large crowds. But he doesn't let
the threats keep him from his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you allow one terrorist to stop you from fulfilling your
divine assignment, then he has been thoroughly successful,'' said
Hagee, an evangelical preacher whose sermons are broadcast on
television.
</P>
<P>
   A key tenet of most Western religions is evangelization, which
requires interaction between the church and potential converts. To
bar the gates would be against many Judeo-Christian principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not lock ourselves up permanently every time one
disturbed person creates an incident such as this,'' said Catholic
Bishop John McCarthy of the Austin Diocese.
</P>
<P>
   Corpus Christi Bishop Edmond Carmody echoed McCarthy's vow to
remain accessible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot operate out of fear,'' Carmody said. ``Sometimes,
people can be very distraught, and no doubt, this man was very
distraught.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, though, openness has to give way to security.
Most chanceries in the country employ stringent security measures,
including magnetic door locks, monitoring systems and guarded
entrances.
</P>
<P>
   But the San Antonio chancery appears to be far less secure than
its counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of Flores' tenure has been accessibility, so
much so that the Catholic Chancery has no security officers or
sign-in process. Visitors can freely visit administrative offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been discussing the possibility of something like this
happening for maybe 10 years,'' said Carlton Brown, director of
management information systems at the chancery. ``The archbishop
didn't feel he needed security.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants people to know that he is accessible to them,'' said
Monsignor Larry Steubben, vicar general of the San Antonio
archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   The policies will undoubtedly be reviewed as a result of
Wednesday's incident, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of five ministers around the country who have had to go
to full-time body guards,'' said Max Lucado, pulpit minister of the
Oak Hills Church of Christ here. ``Maybe it's just a reflection of
the day.''

THE SOUND OF SCULPTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL STRAUSS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ One of the more admirable qualities of the Experience
Music Project, the $240 million rock 'n' roll museum conceived by
Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, is its commitment to local
musicians and artists. This is evident not just in its memorabilia
from artists like Nirvana, Jimi Hendrix, Heart and the Sonics, but
also in its centerpiece: A giant sound sculpture made up of 600
guitars strung along the branches of a metal tree rising more than
30 feet into the air.
</P>
<P>
   On closer examination, little metallic centipedes seem to be
perched over the strings of several dozen of the instruments: These
are self-playing, self-tuning guitars that have been invented for
the project. Throughout the day, guitar picks on mechanical arms
strike the strings as computer-controlled dampers press down on the
frets, creating eerily beautiful music.
</P>
<P>
   The sculptor, inventor and composer behind this piece, titled
``If 6 Was 9'' (not just after the Jimi Hendrix song but also after
a ratio considered in developing the instruments), is a Seattle
resident who has spent his life outside the two local worlds the
museum represents: Rock and Microsoft. He is known as simply
Trimpin, one of Seattle's best-kept secrets, an excitable,
gray-bearded, German-born sound artist and recent recipient of a
MacArthur Foundation fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms observed during a recent visit to Trimpin's Seattle
studio were covered with the detritus of his more than 20-year
obsession with turning acoustic instruments into sculptures that
can be played by motors or by valves that release water, air and
even fire. In one corner stood a piano with pistons hanging over
each key. Upstairs was an old invention that combines a tuba and a
stand-up bass. Notebooks full of brightly colored, heavily
annotated diagrams and scores covered the tables. And on the walls
hung a dozen one-string prototypes of his mechanical guitar.
Trimpin tapped a key on his computer and the picks began clicking
over the strings, filling the studio with sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as a 21st-century player guitar,'' said Trimpin, who
is known for his work with Conlon Nancarrow, the Mexico City
composer best remembered for creating compositions for player piano
too complex to be played by human hands. ``When I was asked to come
up with a proposal for the museum, I wanted to do something with
strings because I've never worked with strings. And I've never
worked with amplified sounds. I've always used natural sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture was built in just five months, with Trimpin
working 14 hours a day in his studio. ``I was dealing with hums and
interference, which I've never had to deal with before,'' he said.
``I had to build a completely different pick system, because a
normal pick has a higher impedance that picks up all the magnetic
noises. Then I thought that I could develop a fiber-optic pickup
that wouldn't have hums. But I didn't have time to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when you think back,'' he went on, ``the basic
loudspeaker design is 100 years ago. We have all these new digital
recording techniques, but we still need to use a loudspeaker with
this heavy coil and magnetic setup. I don't understand why that
still exists. I learned from this project that I'm not satisfied
with artificial, amplified sounds; when I work on my next project,
I want to change them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another inventor might run out and try to patent the player
guitar, the new picking system, the fiber-optic guitar pickup, and
the 21st-century loudspeaker. But not Trimpin. Though many of his
instruments, designs and ideas could make millions in the
instrument-manufacturing and even the toy world, he has never
applied for a patent or tried to mass produce anything.
</P>
<P>
   His goal is simply to combine sound, visuals and movement in new
ways and, in the process, modify instruments to extend their
repertory beyond human limitations. His guitars, for example, can
not only be played in configurations impossible for human hands
but, in the space it takes to get from one note to another, they
can also switch into a completely different tuning system.
</P>
<P>
   Trimpin says his interest in redesigning instruments comes from
his childhood in the Black Forest in Germany. ``When I got toys for
my birthday or Christmas, I had to take them apart first so I could
see what's inside and how it works,'' he said. ``And then I could
play with it. So there was always this curiosity of how mechanics
work.''
</P>
<P>
   During the visit, Trimpin was busy packing his fire organ so it
could be shipped for a performance at the Sound Symposium in
Newfoundland. It is a thermodynamic organ that uses a glass flame
in a Pyrex tube to produce sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normal organ pipes use forced air to make the sound, but here
you get warm air rising, and at a certain temperature it creates a
much more beautiful, richer sound,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Trimpin eventually wants to incorporate the fire organ into a
multimedia piece that will also use cold water dropping onto heated
plates to generate pitch-specific hisses. In addition, the steam
that results will be used as a screen for projections.
</P>
<P>
   Trimpin said all of his ideas, even that one, evolve out of his
childhood experiences. ``The fire organ is based on a big bonfire
we had on top of a mountain after carnival every year in the
village where I grew up,'' he said. ``You'd put some square wooden
discs ... In a fire until they glowed, then slam them over a ramp
and they'd take off and howl into the air.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the village residents were watching these low-tech
fireworks, Trimpin was listening to the steam produced by the wet
discs and the whistling of their flight. ``I could always hear
choirs singing and whole symphony orchestras playing in the sounds
created by this tremendous heat,'' he said. ``I always looked
forward to going to the bonfire because I could listen to this
symphony.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimpin turned back to his fire organ and continued packing,
trying to finish in time to hear another sort of symphony: He had
free tickets to James Brown that night. ``I like to go to concerts
and galleries and museums,'' he said, ``but when I go to the
junkyard I have the same experience because I can fantasize about
discovering things. So junkyards and museums and concerts are all
on the same level for me: There are inspirations to be found at all
of them.''

   Q. I have impaired vision and find that the white background and
black type used in Microsoft Word documents is hard on my eyes. Is
there any way to change the background color of the documents for
easier reading?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, there is a setting within Microsoft Word that will let
you create and use documents that have a dark blue background with
white text on the screen. You may find that combination easier to
read, and your files will still print normally.
</P>
<P>
   To change the setting in Microsoft Word 97 and 2000 for Windows,
open the Word document you want to view, go to Tools in the menu
bar and select Options. A box with several tabs will pop up on the
screen. Click on the General tab and then check the box for ``Blue
background, white text.'' Click on OK.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a Macintosh and Word 98 user, go to the Tools menu in
the Mac's menu bar and select Preferences from the list. That will
call up the tabbed Preferences box. Click on the General tab, check
the ``Blue background, white text'' box and click on OK.
</P>
<P>
   Windows and Macintosh systems have a number of features to help
users with impaired vision and other disabilities use the computer
more easily. In Windows 98, for example, if you go to the Start
menu, then to Settings and to Control Panel, then double-click on
Accessibility Options, you can change your screen to a
high-contrast, white-on-black display with extra-large fonts and
icons. Within Accessibility Options, you can also assign mouse
functions to the keyboard and create keyboard shortcuts for common
tasks.
</P>
<P>
   You may also want to use the Windows 98 Accessibility Wizard to
set up your system for better ease of use. To find the
Accessibility Wizard, go to the Start menu, then to Programs. Find
Accessories on the list and then go to Accessibility, where you
should find the Accessibility Wizard. (If you do not find it on the
list, it may not have been installed on your computer and you will
have to install it from your Windows 98 CD-ROM.)
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has a detailed section about Accessibility on its Web
site at www.microsoft.com/enable. The page is full of links to
documentation on customizing Windows to suit your needs, as well as
guides for special hardware and software products. You can also
sign up for a newsletter on accessibility issues and get a free
documentary video on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer has also included a number of options in the
Macintosh operating system that are designed to aid users with
disabilities. In most versions of the Mac OS, you can find items
called CloseView and EasyAccess in the Control Panels area under
the Apple menu. (Version 9 of the Mac OS calls that control panel
Universal Access.) CloseView will let you magnify the contents of
your screen up to 16 times, and EasyAccess will allow you to assign
mouse functions to keys and condense multiple keystroke commands to
just one key, among other features. With the Mac's Speech control
panel, you can also configure the Mac to read the text of alert
boxes out loud.
</P>
<P>
   You can find more information on adjusting the Macintosh for
special needs on Apple's site at
www.apple.com/education/k12/disability. The page contains links to
a library of Apple software and other shareware designed for users
with disabilities, as well a product guide and news updates.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am left-handed and find it hard to ``right click'' with the
mouse. Can I change the functions of the two mouse buttons?
</P>
<P>
   A. You can reverse the functions of the buttons on your mouse by
going to the Start menu, then to Settings and the Control Panel.
Double-click on the Mouse control panel and click on the button for
Left-handed. That will reassign the old ``right click'' contextual
menus and special dragging function to the outside button on the
standard mouse and put the normal click and drag functions on the
inside button for left-handers.

   HARTSDALE, N.Y. _ Lia Cupani tugged at the corsage on her wrist
as the other graduates pinned on their mortarboards. Gabriel
Levine, this year's student speaker, scanned his note card one last
time before the strains of ``Pomp and Circumstance'' rose up.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my mommy and daddy!'' whimpered Hunter Smaldone.
</P>
<P>
   You could hardly blame him. He is 4 years old. Yet there he was,
along with his classmates at Creative Beginnings Children's Center,
about to celebrate what has become a milestone in this season of
commencements: the preschool graduation.
</P>
<P>
   In Westport, Conn., the Landmark Academy Preschool gave awards
not only for ``Always says please and thank you'' but also for
``Best rester.'' In Mineola, on Long Island, the Tutor Time Child
Care center even put out a yearbook for its young graduates. And
suggesting how seriously some take all of this, one preschool in El
Paso had to call in the police to control a crowd of parents trying
to squeeze into a graduation ceremony in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   No one, yet, has invited Alan Greenspan to speak. But still,
preschool graduations are taking on all the trappings of similar
events on college campuses _ the caps and gowns, the diplomas, the
grandparents flying in from overseas, the triumphant bubble-blowing
at festivities' end.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when pressure to achieve comes younger and younger _
parents compete to see who walks first, who reads first, who gets
into Harvard early _ it only makes sense that each step, no matter
how early, takes on more moment. As transitions go, the one to
kindergarten might not seem so rough. But preschools across the
country say they want to ease it by marking all that has come
before _ even if all that's come before is block building, song
singing and the ABC's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tradition is a grown-up thing, but it also gives a child
an acquaintance with what is next,'' said Vicki Folds, vice
president for early childhood education at Tutor Time, a company in
Boca Raton, Fla., that operates 204 preschools nationwide. ``We
can't just throw them into a new environment. We have to tell them
they are ready for it, they are going to succeed. A stressful child
can't learn as well as one who's confident.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hartsdale, Creative Beginnings held several dress rehearsals
to prepare the 4- and 5-year-olds for the big day. Teachers tied
1,000 bright blue balloons into an archway over the blacktop
playground behind the school and roped off the surrounding grassy
area for the audience.
</P>
<P>
   As parents warmed up their camcorders outside on the lawn, the
graduates showed off their finery back in the classroom _ a pink
tulle dress for Lia, a tuxedo for Daniel Berle. The pint-sized
mortarboards came with elastics to fasten under the chin, but no
one, sighed Josephine Covais, a teacher, wanted to wear them.
Elastics are so preschool.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, the graduates were feeling cocky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're free play!'' hollered Emily Mancuso, 5, throwing her
fists in the air. ``WE get to make the rules!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to have snack?'' asked Lia, whose teachers voted
her most likely to become a congresswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looks like she's going to a wedding,'' one little girl
blurted as Emily Hsu flounced in wearing a poufy white dress.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers here chose Gabriel to deliver the message from the
graduates because he could read, and so he dictated a few brief
sentences expressing the graduates' thanks to the school.
``Remember,'' his teacher, Covais, whispered into his ear as he
reviewed one last time, ``Periods mean `stop.'''
</P>
<P>
   As the graduates lined up for the procession, their teachers
reminded them to wait for the music to begin, and advised the girls
to hold up their dresses as they walked up the grassy hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just have fun,'' Covais advised. ``Remember, those are only
your mommies and daddies out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The underclassmen marched in first, tied together by a rope. The
parents burst into applause, some clapping around bags of Cheerios
brought along to calm cranky younger siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dress down now!'' a teacher hissed at Emily Hsu, still
carrying the bustle of her dress like a bag of groceries in front
of her.
</P>
<P>
   The graduates sat beaming and more still than any of their
parents could ever remember seeing them, as Gabriel read his
speech, enunciating syllable by syllable (but remembering to stop
for periods). Walking up one by one, they took their diplomas with
their right hand and shook the hand of the director, Susan
Stevenson, with their left.
</P>
<P>
   Like most graduations, this one stretched on too long, with four
speakers, including two alumni, now elementary school students, who
offered wise words about the good and bad things that happen to you
after preschool. (Good things: No naps in kindergarten. Bad things:
You get homework.) The graduates amused themselves by finding uses
for their rolled-up diplomas, as telescopes or bats to hit one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after Susan Stevenson, the director, bid them ``a great
time in kindergarten,'' the graduates rushed into the waiting arms
of their parents, greeted with bouquets and shouts of ``We did
it!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It squishes your heart,'' said Lia's mother, Imre Cupani,
wiping her eyes.

<P>
   Much of the effort was for the parents, as Emily's mother, Karen
Hsu, acknowledged. A chiropractor, she had canceled all her
appointments for the afternoon. ``My clients don't understand,''
she said, ``but I'm really excited.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she knows the significance,'' Hsu added,
watching her daughter. ``She just knows she's getting big and she's
going to go on the bus. She's excited about getting big, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   If all this seems to be taking preschoolers a bit too seriously,
those who organize the graduations say the ceremonies work to the
opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   Parents have become so competitive, and are so bombarded by
advice on how their children should be developing, said Folds at
Tutor Time, that they sometimes worry too much if their children
are not achieving enough at a young age. The graduation, she said,
is a way of recognizing that every child has achieved. After all,
everyone graduates cum laude from preschool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are looking for children to do more, sooner,'' she
said. ``This helps recognize the positive things that are
happening. We applaud the joyfulness of the child. We don't want to
lose sight of that. We don't want to turn them into adults too
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   To that, Craig Cupani, Lia's father, could only sigh wistfully
from behind his camcorder. ``It's the first big step in life,'' he
said. ``Then elementary school, junior high, high school, college.
Then she's gone.''

   COURT-ABORTION (Washington) _ A divided Supreme Court strikes
down a Nebraska law banning ``partial-birth'' abortions, ruling
that the statute imposes an ``undue burden'' on a woman's right to
end her pregnancy. The 5-4 decision _ the court's most important
ruling on abortion in eight years _ is rekindling debate on the
landmark Roe v. Wade ruling of 1973 that legalized the procedure.
In another abortion-related decision, the court gives states
greater leeway to restrict anti-abortion protests outside health
clinics. By MARK HELM. (Already filed.)

<P>
   COURT-SCOUTS (Washington) _ The Boy Scouts of America may bar
homosexuals from becoming troop leaders, the Supreme Court says. In
a 5-4 decision the court rules that the Scouts are a private
organization and thus have a right to exclude people that don't
share their values. Forcing the Scouts to accept openly gay troop
leaders would violate the group's First Amendment right to free
association, the court holds. By MARK HELM. (Already filed.)

COMMENTARY: A DIFFERENT REPUBLICAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush is telling all who will listen that he is a
``different kind of Republican.'' He insists that while he remains
a conservative, he nevertheless is willing to address the concerns
of ethnic minorities and others who, to one degree or another, have
perceived the Republican Party to be hostile to their interests.
</P>
<P>
   To accept this claim of heightened consciousness and increased
tolerance, one has to overlook certain things about Bush. On
Monday, for example, he spoke at a dinner given by the eccentric
Congress of Racial Equality, where he shared the dais with _ of all
people _ Bob Grant, one of the vilest, most racially inflammatory
personalities ever to be heard on New York radio.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Grant, who is white, would get behind the microphone
and spew the worst kinds of invective at black people. ``I can't
take these screaming savages,'' he would say, ``whether they're in
that African Methodist church, the AME church, or whether they're
in the streets, burning, robbing, looting.''
</P>
<P>
   He would wonder aloud ``if they've ever figured out how they
multiply like that. It's like maggots on a hot day. You look one
minute and there are so many there, and you look again and, wow,
they've tripled!''
</P>
<P>
   Grant toned down his act only after he was fired from WABC radio
for disgusting comments he made about the death of Commerce
Secretary Ron Brown in a plane crash in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   To see Bush as a different kind of Republican, as a politician
serious about reaching out to blacks and other minorities, one
would have to overlook his decision to share the dais with such a
man. Just as one would have to overlook the flap over Charles
Williams, who was appointed by Governor Bush to lead a commission
that oversees law enforcement training in Texas. The appointment
came a year after Williams testified in a discrimination case that
he did not consider certain grotesque, racially charged terms to be
ethnic slurs. The terms included ``porch monkey'' and ``black
bastard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's in a general statement, no, I don't consider it a
racial slur,'' said Williams, who is white and the police chief of
Marshall, Texas He also said that when he was growing up, black
people didn't mind being called ``nigger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born and raised with blacks,'' he said. ``And back then
we had Nigger Charlie and Nigger Sam, Nigger Joe. And we regarded
those people with all the respect in the world. That was their
name.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``They didn't mind. It wasn't any big deal then.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, would come as news to an awful lot of black
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had not been aware of Williams' comments when he
appointed him chairman of the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement
Officer Standards and Education. The governor said: ``I don't
accept racism in any shape or form. At the very minimum, he ought
to apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief apologized and quietly stepped down as chairman,
although he remains on the commission and is still the chief in
Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appointee as state health commissioner, Dr. William R.
Archer III, got into similar trouble. He made offensive comments
about Hispanics back in April, and during the controversy over
those remarks it came out that he had made offensive remarks about
blacks a couple of years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And it was George W. Bush himself who in February made that
now-notorious visit to Bob Jones University in South Carolina to
tout what he called ``our ideas, Republican ideas, conservative
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   There certainly is a need for a different kind of Republican.
Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, declared several months ago that Bush
was virtually certain to be the Republican Party's presidential
nominee, unless ``some black woman comes forward with an
illegitimate child that he fathered.''
</P>
<P>
   Swell.
</P>
<P>
   Even retired Gen. Colin Powell, a Republican, said last Sunday
that the GOP has not done a good job representing blacks.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Bush's claim to being ``different'' seems weak.
He's been hanging out in some low places with some low people. He
says his heart is pure, but there's only so much you can overlook.

HOSPITAL REVERSES ITSELF ON HINCKLEY VISITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: St. Elizabeths has no apostrophe)  
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Washington psychiatric hospital reversed itself on Wednesday
and withdrew its recommendation that a court permit John W.
Hinckley Jr. to leave the hospital for unsupervised weekly visits
with his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley, who was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the
1981 shooting of President Ronald Reagan and three others, has
argued for years that he should be permitted more freedom. He has
argued that his mental health has improved since he attempted the
assassination to prove his devotion to the actress Jodie Foster.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal by the hospital, St. Elizabeths in Washington,
followed court filings on Tuesday in which prosecutors said
Hinckley had deceived his psychiatrists this spring and had
``continual interest in violently themed books and music.''
</P>
<P>
   At least twice before, St. Elizabeths has reversed itself after
urging more freedom for Hinckley. After a recommendation in 1987 in
which the hospital said Hinckley was no longer a danger, government
investigators found 47 photographs of Foster under Hinckley's
mattress.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley could continue to seek the unsupervised visits, but the
hospital's backing had been expected to be influential with the
judge, June L. Green, of the U.S. District Court in Washington.
Since last July, Hinckley, 45, has been permitted occasional visits
to malls, restaurants and bookstores in the Washington area but
only when accompanied by hospital employees.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors did not identify the books or music Hinckley had
obtained but said that after the hospital recommended the
unsupervised visits last March, he had told his treatment team
about the materials. Hinckley also acknowledged that his fiancee,
Leslie deVeau, had helped him keep the materials secret from the
hospital, the prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that deVeau had purchased certain books for him,
brought them to St. Elizabeths, given them to him and taken them
back once Hinckley had read them,'' said the filing by the federal
prosecutors, Robert R. Chapman and Thomas E. Zeno.
</P>
<P>
   DeVeau's telephone number is unlisted, and she could not be
reached on Wednesday. Hinckley's lawyer, Barry Levine, did not
respond to telephone calls, but The Washington Post reported on
Wednesday that Levine had said on Tuesday that the prosecutors'
assertions were a smokescreen to distract attention from the
remission of Hinckley's psychiatric illness.
</P>
<P>
   DeVeau and Hinckley met while she was in the same hospital after
being acquitted by reason of insanity for killing her 10-year-old
daughter. She was released in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   St. Elizabeths' director of forensic services, Dr. Raymond
Patterson, declined to discuss Hinckley's case but said the
hospital would typically withdraw a recommendation for unsupervised
visits if it acquired new information.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley's efforts to win more freedom have often been
frustrated by disclosures. Once it was found that he had written to
the serial killer Ted Bundy and once that he had sought a nude
drawing of Foster. There has also been evidence that Hinckley
developed an obsessive interest in a female pharmacist at the
hospital in the mid-1990s and that he expressed admiration for the
serial killer Charles Manson.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 ruling on one of Hinckley's requests, Green said
Hinckley had often deceived those treating him. The judge quoted
from a 1987 diary entry by Hinckley. ``Psychiatry is a guessing
game, and I do my best to keep the fools guessing about me,''
Hinckley wrote. ``They will never know the true John Hinckley.''

 &HT;    Gore announces plan to save energy and cut taxes
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Vice President Al Gore, campaigning in Columbus
on Wednesday, unveiled a proposal to give tax credits to people who
buy energy-efficient cars and homes and announced a $10 million
expansion of an administration program that encourages business
development in distressed areas.
</P>
<P>
   He also said recent 5-4 Supreme Court decisions on
abortion-related matter underscore the importance of the
presidential choice this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``One vote on the wrong side of the issue would change the
outcome, and a woman's right to choose would be taken away,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   To highlight his energy proposal, Gore praised Joshua Homes, a
Columbus company that builds energy-efficient houses, and traipsed
through a muddy construction site, to tour the environmentally
friendly home of Amy and Brian Crosby.
</P>
<P>
   He said his tax-cut plan is designed to promote saving energy.
Under the plan, people buying fuel-efficient cars would be eligible
for a tax credit up to $6,000; those upgrading home insulation or
heating and cooling systems would could qualify for a credit up to
$2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get the tax incentives, then it becomes too good of a
deal to pass up,'' he said. ``There's no doubt that we can save the
environment and thus reduce pollution dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   The Crosbys' decision to build an energy-efficient home was
mostly based on finances, Brian Crosby said. The couple paid about
$1,000 additional for an energy saving furnace and air conditioning
system, but Crosby expects it to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically going to pay for itself on the savings we'll
get on our electric bills,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors, Vivian and Chuck Stuart, offered support. Vivian
Stuart said her apartment's gas bill averaged $260 in the winter,
compared to the monthly $63 she and her husband pay now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got twice the square footage and one-third of the gas
bill,'' her husband said.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners like the Stuarts are helping out the environment
while keeping bills low, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get rid of the debt of pollution that we shouldn't
pass on to the next generation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Gore shifted his focus from middle class
suburbs and environmental awareness to distressed communities in
need of economic growth and resources.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing conference on community empowerment, he announced the
adminstration's Community Empowerment Fund would receive $10
million in new funding. He said he would expand the Clinton
administration's empowerment program that helps local leaders start
up, attract and keep businesses in underdeveloped urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   He clearly was addressing a friendly audience. When Nancy
Santana, a Pennsylvania woman who started her own cleaning business
with the help of the empowerment program, introduced him _
apparently by accident _as the next president, people stood and
cheered.

NAPSTER TECHNOLOGY ANOTHER BEND IN WEB REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet transformed the world by linking computer networks.
The World Wide Web transformed the Internet by making it easy to
link files on those computers.
</P>
<P>
   Now another major transformation is occurring, in the form of
programs like Napster and Gnutella. These programs, best known for
allowing college students to swap music files, make it easy to link
one computer directly to another for the purpose of transferring
files anonymously. In the case of Gnutella and similar services
like Freenet, CuteMX, JungleMonkey and Hotline, central computers
are bypassed altogether.
</P>
<P>
   And that, to paraphrase Elvis Presley, has the Web all shook up.
By enabling millions of computer users to search for files and
transfer them from one desktop computer to another, instead of the
current model in which files typically are stored on and retrieved
from Internet computers called servers, the balance of power shifts
from the commercial interests that now dominate the Internet to the
individual.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is a good place to start to understand how these new
``peer to peer'' services differ from the majority of Internet
sites, because it is relatively simple, is limited to .MP3 music
files, and is the most consumer-friendly of the services. A similar
service for Macintosh computers is Macster (www.macster.com).
Gnutella, Hotline and Freenet are a bit more complicated and are
still used mainly by techies.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is the new Elvis of the Internet, the rebel that rocks
the establishment because of its wild popularity among young people
and its whiff of dangerousness. According to Napster, more than a
hundred new users download the software every second from
www.napster.com, adding to the 14 million who have already
registered to use it. The company acknowledges that many of these
users are sharing copyrighted music, mainly digital .MP3 music
files that have been copied from commercial audio CDs. The program
can, of course, be used in a completely legal fashion, trading
uncopyrighted music files, perhaps including your as-yet
undiscovered garage band or your latest rap compositions. The tool
itself is not intrinsically illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The music industry sees Napster as the devil in disguise. It
fears that when CD-quality songs are free for the taking over the
Internet, people will be less willing to pay $15 or more for a CD
in a store. So, the Recording Industry Association of America and
major record companies are suing Napster, seeking to shut it down.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, which is based in San Mateo, Calif., was still very
much in business on a recent afternoon. Eddie Kessler, Napster's
vice president of engineering, checked the logs and said there were
more than 450,000 people connected to Napster's servers at that
moment, sharing millions of song files.
</P>
<P>
   What were these people doing? Probably the same thing I was,
looking for songs to add to the collection on my hard disk. I went
looking for ``Jailhouse Rock,'' and within five minutes it was on
my computer. My cost? Zero. Revenue to Elvis' estate and to the
record company? Zero. Illegal? Not according to Napster. But ask a
copyright lawyer, and the answer is most likely to be yes.
</P>
<P>
   Napster makes it easy for people to violate copyright laws. Most
of the traffic is in music that one would otherwise have to buy in
the stores.
</P>
<P>
   It works like this: You download the Napster client program to
your Windows computer from Napster's Web site. (Macintosh, Linux
and other versions are expected soon). Once the software is
installed, and after you promise not to violate any copyright laws,
you register a screen name and designate which files on your
computer you want to share with others. Typically these are your
.MP3 files. You are not required to share your files, but Napster
is based on community sharing, and most people give as well as
take.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking on the Napster icon connects you to one of Napster's
server computers. The servers do not store any files. They merely
act as matchmakers. Type in a search query for ``Elvis,'' and in
seconds you see a list of the first 100 Elvis Presley (and some
Elvis Costello) tunes being offered by all currently connected
Napster users. For lesser known artists only a handful of tunes may
show up.
</P>
<P>
   Transferring a file from someone else's computer is as simple as
clicking on a bar that says ``Get Selected Songs.'' At this point,
Napster enables a seamless Internet connection between your
computer and the one containing the file you want. Seconds, minutes
or hours later, depending on the speed of the Internet connections
on both ends of the exchange, the file pops into your computer.
</P>
<P>
   The song can then be played through the computer speakers,
transferred to an audio CD through a CD-R drive, or _ with the new
generation of digital audio receivers that are soon to come to
market _ played through a home stereo system. It can also be left
in the shared music folder so that other Napster users can copy it
from you.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's transfer screen shows both the files arriving at your
computer, and the files that other people are siphoning from your
hard disk. Are you lonesome tonight? With the click of another
button, you can enter a public chat session with other Napster
users on your server _ up to about 6,000 people per server _ or
send an instant message to anyone connected to Napster at the time.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason Napster is so popular among college students,
besides the fact that many of them are broke and do not object to
getting music for free. A typical three-minute song file is more
than 3 megabytes in size, or more than 25 million bits (there are 8
bits to the byte). A cable modem or Digital Subscriber Line modem
that transfers several million bits per second is clearly
preferable to a dial-up modem that is limited to 14,400, 28,800 or
even 53,000 bits per second. Napster would not be nearly as popular
if college students did not have easy access to 10-megabit (10
million bits per second) Ethernet connections in their dormitory
rooms and libraries.

 UNDATED: rooms and libraries. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Napster makes it easy to search not only by the name of the
artist or the song title, but also by such important variables as
bit rate, connection speed and ping rate.
</P>
<P>
   Bit rate refers to the sampling quality of the digital copy; in
general, the higher the bit rate, the more closely the recording is
to the original. A bit rate of 128 or higher is, for most
listeners, virtually equivalent to audio CD quality. But the higher
the bit rate, the larger the file.
</P>
<P>
   File transfers take forever if you are downloading to or
uploading from someone who is using the equivalent of a hand-crank
modem. Napster allows people to restrict their music searches to
computers that have high-speed connections. Listing your connection
speed is voluntary, and some people with fast connections may lie
because they do not want everyone to be hitting on them. The ping
rate indicates the time it takes, in milliseconds, to send a test
signal (the ping) to the target computer and to get a reply (the
pong). A double-digit ping rate is good.
</P>
<P>
   Gnutella (http://gnutella.wego.com/) also allows the sharing of
copyrighted music files, but its impact is likely to be felt much
more broadly once the software is made easier to use. Unlike
Napster, Gnutella bypasses a server completely and is designed to
allow individuals to send and receive all kinds of files without
going through a central computer. Music, movies, speeches,
television shows, pictures, novels, software, business documents _
anything that can be digitized can now be stored and shared with
other computers without going through a giant portal or central
file server.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed one way, Gnutella is a hammer that can break censorship
on a global level, because once a file is in circulation, the only
ways to contain it are to shut down the Internet or confiscate
individual PCs _ in other words, nearly impossible. Viewed another
way, Gnutella and its siblings can also break copyrights and
business models and law enforcement in the digital realm. The
commercial software industry, which counted $12 billion lost to
software pirates last year, has nightmares over the potential
losses from programs like Gnutella, Hotline (www.bigredh.com),
JungleMonkey (www.junglemonkey.net) and Freenet
(http://freenet.sourceforge.net/). There is no pressure point or
server system that can stop the hemorrhaging, as the Record
Industry Association is attempting to do by suing Napster.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I deleted the Elvis downloads from my computer. It
simply did not seem fair to Elvis' estate or his record company to
enjoy his music without paying something for it. Indeed, Napster
may soon impose a subscription fee as a way to compensate the
record companies and artists whose music is being bootlegged.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the technology exists for millions of Internet
users to share files easily, the genie is out of the bottle. Once
again, the technology has outpaced the laws, business models and
public discussion needed to cope with it. The debate is just
beginning.

FED DECIDES TO LEAVE INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED, AT LEAST FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: rewritten with additional information; story grows by about
700 words)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve voted Wednesday to leave
interest rates unchanged, giving itself more time to determine
whether the series of rate increases it has imposed over the last
year are slowing the economy sufficiently to avoid an upturn in
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But the central bank warned that it could start raising rates
again as soon as its next meeting, on Aug. 22. Analysts said the
Fed would probably tighten policy in August unless economic
indicators in coming weeks provide assurance that the red-hot pace
of economic growth earlier this year has given way to a more
sustainable path that reduces the threat of an inflationary spiral
in wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve's decision had been widely anticipated by
economists and investors, and Wall Street took the news largely in
stride. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed more than 100
points but fell back after the Fed announcement to close at
10,527.79, up 23.33 points for the day. The Nasdaq composite index
rose 81.38 points, to 3,940.34.
</P>
<P>
   In calling a time out Wednesday in its campaign of rate
increases _ six over the last year, pushing its benchmark federal
funds target rate up by 1.75 percentage points, to 6.5 percent _
the Fed acknowledged that there has been some evidence that the
economy is cooling off. And the central bank noted that while
inflation by some measures has been accelerating, price pressures
are being held down by continuing improvements in productivity, a
measure of the economy's ability to produce more for less.
</P>
<P>
   But the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market
Committee suggested that it remains unconvinced that the economic
slowdown is for real. And it stressed its continuing concern that
the current low rate of unemployment _ 4.1 percent in May _ could
lead wages to rise so fast that companies would be forced to jack
up their prices.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of moderating growth ``are still tentative and
preliminary, and the utilization of the pool of available workers
remains at an unusually high level,'' the committee said in a
statement released at the conclusion of a two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Under those circumstances, the statement said, ``the committee
believes the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions
that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the wording of the statement was intended in part
to keep investors off balance and keep stock prices from surging on
the assumption that the Fed was finished or nearly finished raising
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said there was a good chance that the Fed would push
rates up by another quarter of a percentage point in August, but
that the decision would be driven by the economic statistics that
come out between now and then.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We're back on data watch,'' said Ian Morris, an economist at
HSBC Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Economists pointed to Wednesday's report on orders for durable
goods as evidence that some of the weakness exhibited by the
economy in the last few months might have been temporary. Orders
for durable goods in May rose 6 percent, to $218.89 billion, more
than reversing a 5.7 percent decline in April, the Commerce
Department reported. Analysts had expected an increase of less than
3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big increase in durable goods today is telling you that
this slowdown is going to be just moderate, that we're not going to
have an extremely sharp slowdown,'' said Maury N. Harris, an
economist at PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said other important indicators in coming weeks could
follow a similar pattern, with chances good that both job creation
and average hourly earnings will rebound in June after being
depressed in May.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects the Fed to raise its federal funds target
rate on overnight loans among banks by a quarter of a percentage
point, to 6.75 percent, in August, and then to push the rate up
again to 7 percent by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Robert V. DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney, also
said he expects the federal funds rate to rise to around 7 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that current financial conditions are not going to
prove sufficiently restrictive to keep demand moving back into
line,'' DiClemente said in a report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining its decision to leave rates unchanged, the Fed
suggested that it remains ambivalent _ or perhaps divided _ over
the potential for inflation to take root.
</P>
<P>
   The open market committee's statement gave equal emphasis to two
competing ways of assessing the outlook. One view, often emphasized
by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is built on the idea that an
acceleration in productivity growth is likely to continue, holding
down costs and tempering any inflation pressures that might result
from rising wages.
</P>
<P>
   In this view, the goal of monetary policy is to bring economic
growth down to ``a pace closer to the rate of growth of the
economy's potential to produce,'' as Wednesday's statement put it.
The economy grew at a 5.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter,
and most Fed officials put the non-inflationary growth rate at
between 3.5 percent and 4 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   But in expressing concern that the low unemployment rate could
ignite inflation, the statement recognized a position advocated by
a number of other Fed officials, including Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed
governor. Meyer believes that with unemployment around 4 percent,
even 3.5 percent annual growth might be enough to generate
inflation pressures.
</P>
<P>
   He has raised the possibility that the Fed might need to push
growth below 3.5 or 4 percent for some period and allow the
unemployment rate to rise to 5 percent or higher in order to
squeeze inflation pressures out of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan works to bring consensus to policy making within the
Fed, and the lines between the two camps are not firmly drawn. But
even if the Fed agrees that tighter monetary policy is beginning to
bite, it could still face a debate over how much further it needs
to go in slowing the economy.  &QL;

NASDAQ POST BIGGEST GAIN IN 7 SESSIONS; DOW HOLDS NARROW GAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Nasdaq composite index had its biggest gain in
seven sessions Wednesday as investors flocked to technology shares
while shunning most blue-chips.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index jumped 81.38 points, or 2.1 percent,
to 3,940.34, its best advance since June 19. Major contributors
were the four Nasdaq stocks that Lehman Brothers selected as
``uncommon values'' that would outperform the broad market over the
next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Juniper Networks surged 10, to 136 7/16; BEA Systems 7 3/64, to
45 63/64; Tellabs 5 5/16, to 68; and Gemstar International 4 1/2,
to 54 3/8. Of the six other Lehman picks also advanced _
Hewlett-Packard rose 7 1/16 to 123 11/16, Agilent Technologies rose
4 5/16 to 79 3/4, Cendant rose 1 3/8 to 14 1/4, Eli Lilly rose 2
3/8 to 87 1/8, and Nortel rose 7/8 to 67 7/8. Micron Technology
slumped 1 7/16, to 88 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which at one stage was up
nearly 116 points, managed to hold on to a gain of just 23.33
points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,527.79.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index climbed 4.27 points, to
finish at 1,454.82.
</P>
<P>
   All major gauges gave ground after the Federal Reserve warned of
a continued inflation risk even though, as expected, it took no
action to raise short-term interest rates further. Analysts said
they found nothing in the central bank's statement to dispel the
belief that at least one more rate increase, probably at the Aug.
22 meeting, was likely, barring convincing evidence that economic
growth had slowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That cloud is still going to be hovering over the party,''
said James Paulsen, chief investment officer for Wells Capital
Management.
</P>
<P>
   But he also pointed to the next wave of corporate earnings,
which will start being announced next month and which should be
about 20 percent higher than in the second quarter of 1999. And if
this coincides with perceptions of an economy that has moved from
unsustainably rapid growth to one headed for a so-called soft
landing, then that ``could be a dynamite combination'' for stocks,
Paulsen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed basically said there are still inflation worries,''
said Kenneth Sheinberg, head of listed trading at SG Cowen. Sixteen
of the Dow's 30 stocks fell Wednesday, but hefty gains by
Hewlett-Packard; IBM, up 3 7/8 to 113 5/8; and Coca Cola, up 2 1/8
to 60, kept the average in positive territory.

   Treasury bond prices fell Wednesday after the Federal Reserve
decided to leave interest rates unchanged but left the door open
for a rate increase in August. The price of the 30-year Treasury
bond fell 7/32, to 104 5/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the
opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.95 percent from 5.94
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year Treasury note increased 4/32, to 102 29/32. The
note's yield declined to 6.10 percent from 6.08 percent on Tuesday.

   In corporate finance, the German telephone giant Deutsche
Telekom sold $9.5 billion of dollar-denominated bonds Wednesday as
part of its record $14.6 billion global bond sale. The dollar
portion was increased 90 percent from an original $5 billion.

 &HT;    Supreme court's ruling a setback for abortion opponents
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Florida's ban on so-called ``partial birth''
abortions was put in jeopardy by the U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday
in a 5-4 decision making it nearly impossible for states to outlaw
the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents decried the ruling. Supporters were
cautiously pleased, but worried about the close vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court's action is imponderable. It is incomprehensable.
This is a damaging blow to the pro-life movement,'' said state Rep.
Randy Ball, R-Titusville, one of the authors of Florida's law
banning this type of abortion. ``We will continue this fight and we
will win this fight.''
</P>
<P>
   James Bopp, a lawyer for the National Right to Life Committee,
called the decision ``a radical expansion of the abortion right.''
Clarke Forsythe of Americans United for Life added: ``It's the most
extreme decision on abortion ever issued by the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Closing out its 1999-2000 term with some of the most divisive
rulings in years, the court added a further setback for abortion
opponents by ruling 6-3 that laws forbidding protesters from coming
too close to people entering clinics are not a violation of their
First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won this time but the battles are far from over,'' said
Lillian Tamayo, chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of
Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast. ``The fact is that this
was a 5-4 decision. What is going to happen the next time an
abortion issue goes before the court?''
</P>
<P>
   Calling it an ``undue burden'' on women's rights, the Court
found unconstitutional a Nebraska law banning partial-birth
abortions, known medically as dilation and extraction, or D&AMP;X. The
procedure involves partially extracting a fetus, legs first,
through the birth canal, cutting the skull and draining its
contents.
</P>
<P>
   A more common procedure is dilation and evacuation, or D&AMP;E, in
which an arm or leg of a live fetus may be pulled into the birth
canal during the abortion operation.
</P>
<P>
   The court said the Nebraska law, while purportedly aimed only at
the D&AMP;X method, could criminalize the more common D&AMP;E method as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The law's other big flaw, Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote for
the court, was that it lacked an exemption that would allow the D&AMP;X
procedure if a doctor concluded it was the best way to preserve a
woman's health. Florida's law allows the procedure when the woman's
life is in danger, but lacks the exemption for a woman's health.
</P>
<P>
   Abortions opponents are especially concerned about Breyer's
conclusion that the law ``must contain a health exception.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is an unexpected setback for the pro-life movement,''
said Ball. ``The health exception is a broad loophole that allows a
doctor to just say a woman is stressed and use that as the
exception.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, chastised
the majority for viewing ``the procedures from the perspective of
the abortionist, rather than the perspective of a society shocked
when confronted with a new method of ending human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's law, passed during this year's legislative session, is
already being challenged in federal court in Miami. Earlier this
month, Judge Joan Lenard barred the state from enforcing the law
until the Nebraska case was decided by the Supreme Court. She is
expected to overturn the law and her decision is likely to be
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe that the Florida law is constitutional and can
withstand a Supreme Court challenge,'' said state Sen. Anna Cowen,
R-Leesburg, who helped write the legislation. ``We were aware of
the Nebraska case when we wrote the law and I think we have a good
law.''
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 84-32 and the Senate voted 30-10 to ban partial
birth abortions in Florida. Gov. Jeb Bush signed the bill into law
on May 25.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Breyer in the court majority were Justices John Paul
Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, David H. Souter and Ruth Bader
Ginsburg. Dissenters were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia, Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate case, supporters of school vouchers got what they
believe is good news in a Louisiana case in which the court ruled
that the government can provide computers to religious schools as
long as it is done in a ``secular, neutral and nonideological,''
way.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 ruling was praised by supporters of private school
tuition vouchers who believe the same criteria can be used to make
voucher programs constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the majority of the court has signaled that school
vouchers are constitutional,'' said Matthew Berry, a lawyer with
the Institute for Justice. He defended, among other programs being
challenged in lower courts, Gov. Jeb Bush's statewide plan to give
parents of poor children money for private schooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Removing the constitutional cloud from school choice will
encourage more legislatures to support such programs,'' Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the ruling is ``a resounding victory.'' He said the
state's voucher plan meets ``the court approved principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agreed that the Court ruling helps supporters of
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court certainly took a sledgehammer to the wall of
separation between church and state today,'' said the Rev. Barry W.
Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of
Church and State. ``The silver lining is that this decision gives
no aid or comfort to voucher supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas wrote the decision joined by Rehnquist, Scalia and
Kennedy. O'Connor and Breyer voted with them but in a separate
opinion they said the other four were too expansive in their
willingness to allow government aid to religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   The three dissenters were Souter, Stevens and Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   In their ruling on abortion clinic demonstrations, the justices
decided the right to avoid ``unwanted communication'' sometimes
outweighs free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 vote upheld Colorado's limits on ``sidewalk counseling''
of patients who show up at clinics where abortions are performed.
</P>
<P>
   The state since 1993 has enforced a ``bubble'' law that
prohibits people from counseling, distributing leaflets or
displaying signs within 8 feet of others without their consent
whenever they are within 100 feet of a clinic entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens wrote for the court that the law is not aimed at the
content of someone's speech but only at where, when and how a
message is delivered.
</P>
<P>
   In his dissent, Kennedy complained that the decision
``contradicts more than a half century of well-established First
Amendment principles.''

CHINA'S FORBIDDEN VIDEO GAME AND WEB PARLORS FLOURISHING 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER 8. LEE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ 3 a.m. on a summer Friday here. A smoke-filled room is
packed with men, faces lighted by computer monitors, adrenaline
running from online combat. Bicycles clutter the alley outside the
door under the sign that reads NG Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   The men are muttering into their headsets, discussing attack
strategies with teammates seated only a few computers away. Brown
and green scenes of soldiers, terrain and tanks scroll rapidly
across the screens. A mobile phone rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' a man snaps at the caller who interrupted him. ``I'm
playing computer games.''
</P>
<P>
   NG Cafe is a net cafe, or a wangba, the businesses that serve as
late-night entertainment sites for hundreds of Beijing residents.
The putative reason the wangbas operate is to provide online
access. But the global scope of the Internet seemed to be mostly an
afterthought in a room where 18 of the 20 computers were engaged in
electronic warfare with opponents sitting nearby. To many Chinese
men, the emergence of the networked computer has less to do with
e-commerce than it has with e-battle.
</P>
<P>
   Six juniors from nearby Peking University have come for an
all-night session of Starcraft, a popular multiplayer computer
game. One of the students, Simon Zhang, said that his economics
professor had joked that Americans routed the Iraqis in the Gulf
War because they had more experience playing video games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some logic to his joke,'' Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the room is male, a demographic reflected in the
fact that the bathroom has only a urinal. Everyone else is directed
to a brick hut across the alley. Most of the men, mainly students
and professionals who work nearby, arrived around midnight, and
many will not leave until dawn.
</P>
<P>
   One man has fallen asleep, his head collapsed against the table.
Another is asleep, sprawled across three chairs. An orange sign on
the wall reads: ``Loud Yelling is Prohibited''; it was prompted by
the frequent over-exuberance of players in the throes of victory or
defeat. Smoke burns their eyes, and some computer keys are charred
from errantly placed cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the government considers the playing of computer
games in wangbas illegal has not stopped thousands of them, and
their cousins, the game parlors (which typically do not provide
Internet access, just locally networked computers) from springing
up across China. The term cafe seems excessively elegant for the
one-room hovels heated by coal stoves that are NG Cafe's lower-end
counterparts and where customers generally pay about 50 cents an
hour and play for hours on end.
</P>
<P>
   But the proliferation of wangbas and game parlors in the last
three years has vexed a government that aspires to monitor social,
political and economic trends. Wangbas, the government believes,
have the potential to alter all three.
</P>
<P>
   When the Internet came to China about five years ago, observers
around the world thought that it would help reshape the politics
and economics of the country by introducing residents to ideas and
ways of life that the government had tried to restrict.
</P>
<P>
   When NG Cafe opened, its owners predicted that most of the
business would come from people seeking Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   But Wang Peng, who works nights at the cafe, said that in the
seven months since the NG Cafe opened, game playing had grown to
about 70 percent of business. Visits to wangbas and game parlors
from Kashgar to Kunming to Kaifeng revealed similar ratios. Some
wangbas, particularly those near universities, have customers who
mostly use the computers for e-mail messaging, chatting or surfing
the Web, but the further the cafes are from educated, affluent
areas, the more computer games take center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Computer games are to Chinese men what pick-up basketball games
are to American men. Instead of going to the neighborhood court,
Chinese men head to their neighborhood wangba. Here, those who are
most savvy on the battlefield earn the respect of their peers and
engage in the digital equivalent of trash talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a social activity,'' Zhang said. ``Playing a game on the
Net is very different from playing a game on a machine because you
can feel other people's hearts beating during the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He typed in a message to his teammates in Chinglish, a
Chinese-English hybrid: ``go zhou. wo dian ta.'' (Go attack Zhou,
I've electrified him.)
</P>
<P>
   Zhang's roommate, Otto Hua, 21, said there were some weeks when
he played multiplayer games for more than 20 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the government prohibited the playing of computer games
in wangbas, a restriction that has been sporadically enforced. The
regulation still permitted Wangbas to provide Internet access, just
not for playing games.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the government reiterated the restriction as part of a
collection of regulations that also prohibited wangba customers
from engaging in activities endangering national security and
disrupting public security and order.
</P>
<P>
   Editorials published in The People's Daily depict wangbas, game
parlors and computer games as a ``plague'' and ``poison.''
Newspapers and television broadcasts regularly report on students
addicted to computer games who do not return home for days, steal
money from their parents and give themselves to the wangbas in
indentured servitude to pay their bills.
</P>
<P>
   Wangba owners must now go to their local public security bureau
to register within 30 days of receiving a business license. In the
last several months, government enforcement has become stricter.
Several hundred unregistered wangbas and game parlors in Beijing
were closed in March, and several hundred wangbas and game parlors
in Shanghai were raided last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some wangbas have responded to the clampdown. Feiyu, a wangba
chain south of Peking University, has restricted game playing. But
other wangba owners are resisting limits on their lucrative
businesses. Last year, a wangba owner in the province of Zhejiang
challenged the restrictions in court saying that despite its social
harm, computer gaming has the potential of aiding development of
information technology in China. In February, the courts rejected
the claim, citing wangbas' societal harm.
</P>
<P>
   By 4:30 a.m., the sky over NG Cafe is light. Zhang and his
classmates leave at 5:30 a.m. after five hours. By 8 a.m., most of
the older customers have left and another wave of players, mostly
younger, arrives, ignoring the sign that prohibits elementary and
middle school students from entering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not afraid of the regulations,'' said Zhang Shi Miao,
13, a student at a middle school. ``The government is overreacting.
Most people don't become addicted to computer games. It's just for
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Many customers are unaware that playing computer games in
wangbas is forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know about these rules. Therefore the responsibility
is not on us,'' said Zhang, when told of the regulations. ``If they
don't strictly administer the law, then we can still go on
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was unlikely that the government would suddenly
strictly enforce the prohibitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many interests in computer-game playing for that
to happen,'' he said. ``In America you would call it lobbying. In
China we call it bribery.''

GORE OUTLINES PROPOSALS ON ENERGY, ENVIRONMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKLICK, Ohio _ Vice President Al Gore wants more Americans to
drive to work on electric power and sleep under roofs latticed with
solar panels, and Wednesday he explained how he would nudge them in
that direction: with lucrative tax credits of up to $6,000 for
buying energy-efficient cars and up to $2,000 for buying houses
that met certain energy-efficient standards.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposals boiled down to a philosophy that says that if
the federal government wants Americans to live and transport
themselves in a fashion less dependent on oil and kinder to the
environment, it should make it worth their while. As president,
Gore said Wednesday, he would.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get the tax credit, then it becomes too good of a
deal to pass up,'' Gore said as he sat on a stack of drywall in the
back yard of a house in this suburb of Columbus that was being
built with an array of energy-saving devices. ``Hopefully, over
time, that will change the pattern of practice so that these
energy-saving options begin to be just the normal way we do things
in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that we can save on energy _ and thus reduce
pollution dramatically _ by giving these tax cuts to Americans who
want to take advantage of them,'' Gore added.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides said that the tax incentives that the vice
president outlined Wednesday would represent about $48 billion in
lost federal tax revenue and spending over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Gore had proposed a 10-year, $75 billion package of
tax breaks and other measures to motivate utility companies and
other manufacturers to explore and implement more energy-efficient
methods to reduce the country's dependence on oil. The vice
president was expected to make additional proposals on Thursday
that would bring the 10-year price of what he described as a new
energy and environmental initiative to much more than $125 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore's critics in the past have painted him as a
tree-hugging extremist or a starry-eyed idealist when it came to
the environment, the vice president has seized on sudden concerns
over the country's dependence on oil as an opportunity to dream big
environmental dreams. Gore had described this moment as ``an echo''
of the energy crisis of the late 1970s in remarks at a fund-raiser
in Washington late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore spoke Wednesday not only in a swing state for the
general election, but in also in a region of the country hit
particularly hard by high gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign and the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas have spent much of the last week trading bitter accusations
that resemble the schoolyard chant, ``I know you are, but what am
I?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his aides have asserted that Bush, as a former oil man
who has received large sums of campaign money from oil and gas
companies, would be unable to stand up to oil-industry interests.
And Bush's aides, in turn, have combed through the vice president's
proposals and statements over time for suggestions or evidence that
Gore at times supported higher fuel prices and had his own cozy
ties to the oil and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Bush's aides complained that the ideas that Gore was
promoting were recycled, unimplemented proposals by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just adding more money,'' said Dan Bartlett, a
spokesman for the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That was true of some of Gore's proposals Wednesday, but not of
others. Gore's plan included a tax credit of 20 percent of the cost
of building equipment that did not rely on oil, like electric heat
pumps, hot water heaters and natural gas heat pumps; a tax credit
of up to $1,000 for the purchase of solar water heating systems and
$2,000 for solar electricity systems; an unspecified tax credit for
consumers who choose utilities in their areas that use cleaner
energy sources, and financial help for low-income families so that
they could better ``weatherize'' their homes and save on energy.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest tax credits for individual consumers were those for
the purchases of automobiles that ran at least partly on
electricity or dramatically maximized fuel efficiency in other
ways. These credits ranged from $4,000 for fuel-efficient pickup
trucks to $15,000 for fuel-efficient 18-wheel cargo trucks.

INVESTIGATION LEADS OFFICIAL TO STEP DOWN IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chuck Quackenbush, the California state insurance
commissioner who has been under investigation on accusations of
diverting millions of dollars in earthquake insurance settlements
into what amounted to a personal political slush fund, resigned on
Wednesday rather than face potential impeachment by the state
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush, one of only two Republican statewide officeholders,
decided to quit after what politicians said were at least two days
of negotiations with the Legislature aimed at limiting his
potential civil and criminal liability. Quackenbush's lawyer said
he had made no deal with legislative leaders, but they canceled a
hearing set for Thursday at which Quackenbush, under subpoena,
would have faced extensive on-the-record questions about his
dealings for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, will appoint a successor to serve
until the next statewide election in 2002, subject to confirmation
by the Legislature, and Davis vowed on Wednesday to choose someone
of ``unquestioned integrity.'' Quackenbush, 46, offered his
resignation, effective July 10, in a one-sentence letter to the
only other Republican constitutional officer, Secretary of State
Bill Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reached the point with all of the controversy that he could
no longer serve effectively as insurance commissioner, and so in
the interests of the people of California, he stepped down,'' said
Quackenbush's lawyer, Donald H. Heller. ``I think it needs to be
very clear that he has done nothing illegal or criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush's resignation followed three months of deepening
scandal in Sacramento over accusations of misusing funds from
nonprofit foundations for personal political purposes. The largest
fund, the California Research and Assistance Fund, was financed by
a half-dozen insurance companies accused of mishandling claims
after the devastating 1994 Northridge earthquake. The insurance
department had threatened the companies with nearly $4 billion in
potential penalties, but Quackenbush agreed to let them settle the
matter by donating some $12 million in tax-deductible contributions
to the new fund.
</P>
<P>
   The fund was supposed to finance consumer assistance programs
and earthquake research, but investigators found that money went
instead for television commercials featuring Quackenbush and to
other groups he favored, including $263,000 to a football camp
attended by his children. While denying any wrongdoing, Quackenbush
has said that he may have made mistakes in judgment, and, as Heller
phrased it, ``put his trust in people who let him down.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republican legislative leaders had warned that if
Quackenbush refused to testify, or if he testified and could not
refute the accusations against him, there would be a bipartisan
impeachment inquiry. It was that collapse of political support that
forced his hand on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Legislature, the state attorney general's office and
the Fair Political Practices Commission, which oversees campaign
finance, have been investigating Quackenbush, the fund and its
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said on Wednesday that his
office had made no deal with Quackenbush, ``and none is
contemplated.'' Lockyer added: ``If crimes have been committed by
anyone associated with these actions, my office will take action to
see that they are prosecuted. We will seek civil penalties and
restitution where appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush, a former state assemblyman, was elected to the
insurance post in 1994, with strong support in campaign
contributions from the industry he regulates. He replaced a
Democrat, John Garamendi, whom the industry had regarded
antagonistically. At one point, insurance agents who made campaign
phone calls to voters on Quackenbush's behalf misrepresented
themselves as police officers, and he apologized. In 1996, a state
audit found that he had not reported $327,000 in 1994
contributions, much of it from the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for the Insurance Information
Institute, an industry group, said 99 percent of claims from the
Northridge earthquake had been settled..
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's an erroneous impression that many claims are
not settled and that insurers were complicit in whatever the
commissioner did,'' Goldstein said. ``And that's simply not true.''

 &HT;    New AirTran ads spoof tyranny of `big airlines'
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Are cheap airfares in the same league with famous
victories over tyranny?
</P>
<P>
   AirTran Airways suggests they are _ in a lighthearted way _ in
new television ads debuting next week.
</P>
<P>
   The discount carrier also is rolling out a new slogan, ``Your
airline has arrived.'' It replaces the 2-year-old tagline ``It's
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   One AirTran TV spot shows a lone business traveler on an airport
tarmac facing a jetliner. The plane moves left, the traveler moves
to block its path. The plane moves right, the traveler moves again.
He finally puts down his briefcase and takes a stand.
</P>
<P>
   It's a takeoff on the historic image of a Chinese student facing
down a tank during the Tiananmen Square demonstrations of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to take a stand'' against the tyranny of unnamed
``big airlines,'' the voice-over implores.
</P>
<P>
   A second TV spot also plays off a historical image. It shows a
couple in New York's Times Square locked in a kissing embrace, a
re-creation of Alfred Eisenstaedt's famous VJ-Day shot at the end
of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war is over,'' the voice-over says, touting AirTran's lack
of Saturday night stay restrictions. ``Now there's an airline that
lets you come home when you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Both ads are filmed in black-and-white, an attention-getting
device. They were produced by Chicago agency Cramer Krasselt.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran's ads follow a new campaign rolled out earlier this year
by its larger Atlanta rival, Delta Air Lines. AirTran is unveiling
the campaign today with a public rally at Lenox Square.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran's advertising has become more sophisticated in the past
year or two. Last fall it issued an innovative movie-trailer style
spot _ still in use in some markets _ touting the arrival of its
first Boeing 717 jets. The spot shows a military radar room, with
controllers panicking at the sight of unidentified planes. The
punchline comes when a senior officer staring helplessly at the
bogeys murmured, ``Oh, Mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline, created by the 1997 merger of Atlanta-based ValuJet
and Orlando-based AirTran, struggled to survive initially but has
had five straight quarterly profits. It's recently been in talks
about a possible combination with TWA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're at a point where we're more confident and
credible in selling ourselves,'' marketing director Tad Hutchison
said.

GOVERNMENTS TIGHTEN GOALS FOR RESTORING CHESAPEAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSE HAVEN, Md. _ A toughened Chesapeake Bay restoration pact
aimed at a tenfold increase in oyster production and a 30 percent
drop in land lost to suburban sprawl was signed on Wednesday by
state and federal officials who hailed it as an environmental model
for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing else like it,'' said Carol M. Browner,
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in praising
the pact's inclusion of the anti-sprawl pledge by the governors of
Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania. ``This is the first-ever
federal-state-local agreement to have that commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The revision of the 18-year-old multigovernment pact was
announced in a ceremony here on the bay's western shore. Speakers
celebrated the slow mending of the bay's tattered ecology and the
innovative standards set for further cleansing the vast bay
resource, which covers 64,000 square miles and serves 15 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement's most ambitious goal is the anti-sprawl
commitment, which would mean a 30 percent reduction in the
projected loss of the bay's farm and forest land to development by
2012. This would spare an estimated 30,000 acres a year if the
state governments lived up to that commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first quantitative target of its sort that one of the
nation's regional water body cleanups has adopted,'' said Michael
Hirshfield, vice president for resource protection at the
Chesapeake Bay Foundation, a watchdog group of scientists and
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprawl has been discussed for years, and enough people felt
this new agreement had to take it on, so it does,'' Hirshfield said
in an interview while praising the separate commitment to
permanently preserve 20 percent of watershed land from development
by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
   While the agreement sets voluntary goals, over the years state
and local governments, prodded by environmental groups, have slowly
enacted laws to meet many of the escalating goals of the pact.
These have produced such successes as the resurgence of rockfish
and the flourishing of pelicans. But progress is offset by the
effects of pollution runoff from farms and suburbs and wetland loss
through development.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also includes a pledge to protect and revive the
devastated blue crab population, with the first cautious harvest
goals to be set across the next year. More promising is the
commitment to a tenfold increase in oysters, one of the crucial
food-chain creatures needed for filtering impurities from the bay.
</P>
<P>
   If met as promised by 2010, this goal would mean a restoration
to about 15 percent of the output of the bay's oyster heyday a
century ago, when 20 million bushels were harvested annually and
the bay was one of the world's premier seafood resources.
Development and pollution devastated the bay and reduced the take
to less than 500,000 bushels. But scientists have developed a
promising technique of recreating the oyster reefs of a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
   With the bay shimmering in the background, Gov. Parris N.
Glendening of Maryland recalled ``the darkest of times'' two
decades ago when the bay's vitality was sapped and the first
uncertain agreement was pledged. He noted the firmer political
commitments that grew to support the pact. This year, his state
earmarked $25 million for the oyster program, and Virginia declared
a vast swath of the bay off-limits to commercial crabbing so female
crabs would be protected and the population might rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state agencies spend about $150 million a year on
programs devoted to reducing pollution, restoring underwater
grasses and reviving waterway passages for migratory fish, a prime
barometer of a healthy bay. Progress against nutrient pollution has
included a drop of 6 million pounds annually in phosphorus and 42
million pounds in nitrogen, but has come with a warning that
expected population growth will intensify the problem.
</P>
<P>
   For all the optimism of the Chesapeake Executive Council, which
includes the District of Columbia as well as the three states,
members noted that the overall goal of seeing the bay removed from
the environmental agency's list of ``impaired waters'' remained
unmet. Among other problems, the bay, including its tidal rivers,
does not meet standards for dissolved oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists expressed disappointment that the pact
did not ban the dumping of dredge spoil in the bay or address
problems like nitrogen pollution from cars and power plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``But overall,'' Hirshfield said, ``compared to other areas of
the country I'm familiar with, in terms of specific actions, this
stacks up very well.''

COURT VICTORY COULD ULTIMATELY HURT SCOUTS, SAY SOME ADVOCATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SCOTUS-GAY-SCOUTS) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In convincing the U.S. Supreme Court that it should have the
right to bar gays from its ranks, the Boy Scouts of America has
definitively established itself as an organization that considers
homosexuality a detriment to the well-being of its young members.
</P>
<P>
   But as the public becomes more tolerant of lesbians and gay men
_ and less accepting of discrimination against them _ some civil
rights advocates said Wednesday that the Boy Scouts' victory could
ultimately harm the group.
</P>
<P>
   Though the organization's membership has grown to nearly 5
million, from 4.3 million in 1997, its aggressive legal campaign to
exclude gay leaders has provoked disenchantment from religious
groups, school boards and volunteer parents around the country.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen municipal governments, including Washington, Chicago and
San Francisco, have severed relationships with the scouts or are
considering measures to keep them from using public buildings. In
Connecticut last month, authorities removed the group from its list
of charities eligible for state payroll deductions. And after
learning of the decision Wednesday, the United Methodist Church,
which sponsors 15 percent of all Boy Scout troops, said it would
encourage local congregations to sever ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boy Scouts have a hollow, Pyrrhic victory,'' said Ruth
Harlow, deputy legal director for Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund, which argued the case of James Dale, an Eagle Scout
assistant scoutmaster whose troop expelled him after learning he
was gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their leaders and lawyers have convinced five members of the
Supreme Court of their narrow, discriminatory vision,'' Harlow
said. ``Now they have to live with that vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Boy Scout officials dismissed the notion that the decision would
spark a backlash against the group. ``We feel that American
families never left the values that the Boy Scouts never left,''
said Gregg Shields, a spokesman for the group. Membership grew, he
noted, even as the scouts waged a 10-year legal battle to retain
the ban. Even if donors or sponsors pulled out, he said, the scouts
would find other support. ``We'll be just fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But David A. Rice, vice president of Scouting for All, a group
that opposes the scouts' policy, said the ruling would force
corporate sponsors and cities with anti-discrimination laws to
review their relationships with the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This narrows the organization and pushes it more firmly into
the hands of religious conservatives and the right wing,'' he said.
``Many public-spirited companies will find they can no longer be
involved with the scouts.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, defections have been minimal. Fewer than a dozen United
Way chapters have withdrawn financing, among them the United Way of
Somerset County, N.J., which last month pulled its annual $30,600
gift after the local scout council refused to sign its
nondiscrimination policy.
</P>
<P>
   In Monmouth County, N.J., where Dale served until his ouster in
1990, reaction was mixed. Some, like Dolores Dalzell, 62, a former
den mother, expressed relief. ``I don't think it's proper,'' she
said about gay scout leaders. ``I wouldn't want my children exposed
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said they were disturbed that the Boy Scouts could now
legally discriminate. Lynda Montague, 28, a secretary from
Sayreville, said the ruling persuaded her to prevent her 8-year-old
son from joining the scouts when he gets older. ``I don't want him
to belong to a group that promotes bigotry,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   New York City officials said they would try to stop the scouts
from using school buildings or receiving support from any publicly
financed agency. Christine Quinn, a member of the City Council,
said that by accommodating scout meetings, the city was violating
its human rights law. ``It's hypocritical to allow this group to
meet in public buildings while telling certain New Yorkers they
can't join them,'' she said.

HIGH COURT RULING FUELS DEBATE ON VOUCHERS FOR EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SCOTUS-SCHOOLS) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For educators and advocates, the question prompted by
Wednesday's U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing some federal aid
for private and parochial schools is, How broadly can it be
applied?
</P>
<P>
   If the government can buy computers, books and audio-visual
equipment for religious schools, as six justices ruled, how about
bricks and mortar for buildings? Why not have states pay the
salaries of Catholic-school teachers of a secular subject like
mathematics? And, perhaps most important, can public money be used
to offset tuition at schools sponsored by religions?
</P>
<P>
   ``What this fits into is a growing sense that public education
can take place outside of the public schools,'' said Clint Bolick,
litigation director for the Institute for Justice, a leading
advocate of school vouchers that would allow taxpayer money to be
used at private and parochial schools. ``This kind of decision
makes public policy much more flexible in terms of aid following
students rather than aid to the public school system exclusively.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ruling, in a case from Louisiana, concerns a narrow
program providing instructional materials, but Justice Clarence
Thomas took the opportunity to write a strong pro-voucher opinion
focused on a neutrality test: whether aid is equally available to
students regardless of where they study. Three justices joined his
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Two others, Sandra Day O'Connor and Stephen G. Breyer, voted
only to uphold the purchase of computers and other equipment but
declined to join Thomas. They drew a distinction between direct aid
to schools for materials and funneling money through parents in the
form of vouchers that are used for religious as well as secular
studies.
</P>
<P>
   That left something for both sides to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real silver lining,'' said Marc D. Stern, a lawyer
for the American Jewish Congress, which promotes separation of
church and state and has helped fight voucher programs. ``Had
Thomas gathered five votes for his opinion, vouchers would be
constitutional. Since he -didn't, it leads me to think that
vouchers are unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolick, for his part, said, ``I understand they are trying to
grasp at silver linings, but the cloud is puffy and white.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is the sixth in a row by the Supreme Court to uphold
using public money in parochial schools. At the same time,
opponents of vouchers have won victories in state supreme courts
and lower federal courts, including rulings over the last year
declaring voucher programs in both Florida and Cleveland illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland case, in which arguments were heard by the 6th
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals last week, is expected to be reviewed
by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been mixed signals coming out of the courts,'' said
Howard Fuller, an administrator at Marquette University and an
architect of Milwaukee's 10-year-old school voucher program.
``Until there's an actual decision on a program like Ohio or
Wisconsin, we just have to hold out hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it portends for future cases, the decision raises broad
questions about public education.
</P>
<P>
   To Jeanne Allen, president of the pro-voucher Center for
Education Reform, based in Washington, the court has endorsed her
belief that ``educating children is no less a public endeavor just
because the child is in a private school.''
</P>
<P>
   But Julie Underwood, general counsel for the National School
Boards Association, said that ``public schools are fundamentally
different from private schools'' and that ``we need to get people
to recognize that there is incredible value in the public-school
system.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to rekindling the political debate over vouchers _
an issue that promises to persist in the presidential campaign _
Wednesday's ruling is likely to spur many requests by parochial
schools for equal funding in other government programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public money that we wish would stay in public schools, that
we think is needed in the public schools, as a constitutional
matter is going to be able to go to the sectarian schools,'' said
Robert Chanin, a lawyer representing the nation's largest teachers'
union, the National Education Association, in the voucher cases.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard DeFiore, president of the National Catholic Education
Association, said the decision should clear the way for a Clinton
administration program that would connect every classroom,
including those in private schools, to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a global classroom to which all students _
public and private _ must have entry,'' DeFiore said in a
statement. ``This decision is justice served because it assures
that these advantages will be accessible to all children.''

PLANTS FOR A CHANGING EARTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNE RAVER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One morning in early June, Dr. Peter Del Tredici led the way
around the Arnold Arboretum at Harvard University to some of the
beautiful old plants he says are tough enough to ride the roller
coaster of recent climate changes. Among them was the Chinese
fringe tree (Chionanthus retusas), with its masses of little white
blossoms covering its broad branches like a silken shawl. The
fragrance was so intoxicating I wanted to open my arms and walk
right into it.
</P>
<P>
   Del Tredici, the arboretum's director of living collections,
grinned at the obvious effect of this forgotten tree, brought there
by the Scottish plantsman Robert Fortune in the mid-1800s.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tree's been here 100 years,'' Del Tredici said. ``It
doesn't need watering, and it grows as well here as in Southern
California.'' In the next five years, he predicted, it will be as
popular as Cornus kousa, the Japanese dogwood, the common
replacement for the Florida dogwood, which is disappearing from
Eastern woodlands because of the stresses of soil and air
pollution, invasive species and anthracnose.
</P>
<P>
   The arboretum, founded in 1872 and designed by Frederick Law
Olmsted, rambles for 265 acres over the hills of Jamaica Plain,
Mass. As plant explorers continue to add to the collection of 7,000
woody plants, it stands as a vast repository of the temperate
world's hardiest specimens. It's Del Tredici's living laboratory,
where he observes, almost daily, which plants survive the ups and
downs of contemporary weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``February was like April, March was like December,'' Del
Tredici said. There are droughts in regions that used to get
dependable rain, and deluges in regions used to long, dry spells.
</P>
<P>
   The fringe tree bumps shoulders with another wonderful toughy,
the Japanese spicebush (Lindera obtusiloba), a shrub about 10 feet
tall and just as wide, with grass-green lobed leaves that turn
bright yellow in the fall. They were definitely a statement, and I
wanted them both.
</P>
<P>
   I also changed my mind about the flame azalea, Rhododendron
calendulaceum, which I've grown to loathe from seeing too many
hot-pink gumdrops and salmon bushes pruned within an inch of their
lives, baking under full sun on an emerald-green lawn. But here,
dozens of them descended a wooded hill in varying shades of yellow,
orange, pink and salmon. The dappled shade of tall oaks softened
their jarring colors; no electric pruners had ruined their
naturally graceful shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do equally well in sun or shade, dry or wet,'' Del
Tredici said. ``They've performed here constantly for 100 years, no
matter what the climate.'' Inferior hybrids and cultivars, he said,
have displaced the original species, which not only is gorgeous,
but also resists powdery mildew.
</P>
<P>
   Another delightful little-known plant is Aristolochia
manshuriensis, or Manchurian Dutchman's pipe, which has showy
yellow flowers in early spring, before it covers itself with big
trident-shaped leaves. It's hardy to Zone 4, or where temperatures
can drop to minus 30.
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't have a fragrant winter hazel, Corylopsis
glabrescens produces soft yellow flowers in early spring; treat
yourself to one near the house. It likes partial shade and moist
soil, however, so don't kid yourself if you live in a desert.
</P>
<P>
   Del Tredici, who teaches at Harvard's Graduate School of Design,
tries to get his students' heads out of the design clouds. It's a
good lesson for homeowners as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens after the landscape design is installed?'' he
asked them. ``It's not the end, it's the beginning.'' Think in
terms of maintenance: ``Don't put a plant right in the mowing
corridor,'' he added. Del Tredici, for instance, didn't recommend
ginkgo trees for Harvard Yard. ``The world view of the maintenance
guy is: how much the trees drop and when they drop it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us won't live long enough to see the trees that we plant
come into their prime, but that's no reason not to start them for
the next generation. And it's a revelation to see the venerable
specimens at the Arnold, which has remained true to its plant
collecting roots. What a relief to walk for miles along winding
paths, drinking in plants that have been planted by the dozens,
along banks and hills, and tended for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my personal discoveries that day were the Japanese tree
lilac, Syringa reticulata, a 30-footer whose spreading branches
were covered with white fragrant blossoms; an old Franklinia
alatamaha, with striated dark and light gray bark (its twisting,
arching branches will bear creamy white, 3-inch flowers in August);
and a 30-foot-tall Chinese Stewartia (Stewartia sinensis) whose
satiny smooth bark is mottled with rose-orange, tan, gray and
green. Another uncommon species, the Chinese Zelkova (Zelkova
sinica) grows to 40 feet, and its exfoliating bark exposes bright
orange patches. Such trees provide great interest in winter.
</P>
<P>
   The evergreen sweet bay (Magnolia virginiana var. australis),
has narrow leaves with silvery undersides and fragrant flowers in
June and July. And if you are looking for a hardy upright holly,
with lots of red fruit for winter, try Ilex pedunculosa, the
longstalk holly. Del Tredici recommends it as an informal hedge or
a specimen.
</P>
<P>
   White Enkianthus (Enkianthus perulatus), which eventually grows
6 feet tall and just as wide, is hardy to Zone 5, or minus 20. It
is covered with small white flowers in spring, and its foliage
turns fire engine red in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The hawthorns are something to see blooming over acres of
orchard grass, with mown paths ambling through like ones on an
English estate. And there's a drive designed by Olmsted through
80-foot hemlocks and mountain laurel, in full bloom in early June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hemlocks are all dying of the woolly adelgid, so enjoy it
now while you can,'' Del Tredici said. The Chinese hemlock (Tsuga
chinensis), which has been growing at the arboretum since 1910 and
is now 60 feet, has not been bothered by the adelgid.
</P>
<P>
   High on Peters Hill, Del Tredici has planted his ``savannah,''
clusters of drought-tolerant, flat-topped trees like sumacs, honey
locusts, yellowwoods and Kentucky coffee trees. Many are legumes,
plants that can fix nitrogen transform it into food) as well as
fertilize the soil. They are also tolerant of heavy clay soil.
</P>
<P>
   As for conifers, Del Tredici recommends the California incense
cedar, Calocedrus decurrens, which is hardy to Zone 5 and can grow
to 60 feet tall even in the East. It's narrow, with bright green
foliage, and tolerant to clay and drought.
</P>
<P>
   And for gardeners plagued by deer, the Japanese plum yew,
Cephalotaxus harringtonia Prostrata, is a low-growing evergreen
that tolerates clay, likes sun or shade and apparently tastes
terrible to voracious deer.
</P>
<P>
   We'll see how long that lasts. Deer, like these plants, have a
great capacity for change.

INTERNET REGISTRAR ORGANIZING USERS FOR BOARD ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 CITIZENS-NYT   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to raise public awareness of an
international election to help administer the Internet, public
interest groups on Wednesday announced a voter registration and
education campaign to recruit what it called cybercitizens.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign urges Internet users to join the Internet Corp. for
Assigned Names and Numbers, which was selected in 1998 to take over
administration of the network's addressing, or domain name system.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit group is holding its first global elections this
fall. Anyone age 16 or older with an Internet address is eligible
to join the group. Those who register on ICANN's at-large
membership Web site (http://members.icann.org/) by July 31 will be
able to vote in the first election.
</P>
<P>
   The public-awareness effort was announced by the Center for
Democracy and Technology, Common Cause and the American Library
Association, three groups that have been working with Icann to try
to ensure that individual Internet users are properly represented
on ICANN's board.
</P>
<P>
   While representatives of business and technical groups have
already elected nine board members, ICANN this fall will hold
elections for the first five of what ultimately will be nine
at-large members, who will represent Internet users in general.
</P>
<P>
   Although ICANN defines itself as a standards-setting body with a
role limited to the technical functions of the Internet, it has
already made rules to protect trademark interests from so-called
cybersquatters, or domain name speculators. And in its next
meeting, scheduled to begin July 13 in Japan, the group is expected
to begin moving on plans to add new top-level domains to supplement
the popular .com, .net and .org suffixes.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Berman, executive director of the Center for Democracy and
Technology, said the goal of the campaign is to educate Internet
users about ICANN and how the group's decisions can effect them.
</P>
<P>
   He compared ICANN's role to one of being able to ``rearrange the
streets of a city, because they are registering our identity.''
</P>

SOUTHWEST, BOEING TO ANNOUNCE BIG 737 ORDER THURSDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Fast-growing Southwest Airlines will announce Thursday
what is by far the biggest order ever for Boeing's next generation
737 _ nearly 300 jets, of which about 100 are firm orders, the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The firm orders are worth more than $4 billion at list prices,
though Southwest is likely getting a sizable discount because of
the large number of planes involved.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and Southwest executives will hold an 11:30 a.m.
teleconference to announce the blockbuster deal. The announcement
ends months of negotiations between the airplane maker and one of
its best customers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Boeing nor Southwest would comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But industry sources said Southwest will announce firm orders
for around 94 jets, with options for 25 planes and ``other''
purchase rights for 171 planes. It was not immediately clear what
those other purchase rights entail. The sources stressed that the
final numbers were still being worked out, and could vary by a few
planes.
</P>
<P>
   The firm orders are for 737-700s and the jets would be delivered
over the next dozen or so years. The 737-700 can carry from 126 to
149 passengers, depending on the configuration. The Southwest
737-700s have 137 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's listed price for the 737-700 ranges from $43.5 million
to $51.5 million, depending on configuration and customer options.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the average list price, the 94-plane Southwest order
would be worth about $4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   No customer, even those ordering one or two planes, ever pays
the list price. With such a large order, Southwest could be
expected to get a significant discount.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Boeing's largest order ever for the next generation
jets came from American Airlines, which ordered 75 737-800s in
1996. That was part of the biggest single Boeing order ever.
American bought 103 planes worth $6.7 billion and took options for
527 more worth an estimated $31 billion.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Boeing has 127 firm orders for the next
generation 737, not including the Southwest order.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest deal means Boeing likely will end the first half
of the year ahead of rival Airbus in new orders. Those orders are
being watched closely by the industry this year to see if Airbus
can maintain its 1999 momentum, when it beat Boeing for only the
second time ever in new orders.
</P>
<P>
   As of May 31, Airbus had notched 190 firm orders for its planes.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing had 188 firm orders as of June 20.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest is the nation's seventh-largest carrier, but the
largest low-fare airline. And it is about to get much bigger, which
is why it needs more airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old airline has been steadily expanding the number
of flights on existing routes while adding additional cities. It
flies to 56 U.S. cities in 29 states. It began flying to Albany,
N.Y., its newest city, in May.
</P>
<P>
   The airline announced two weeks ago that it would begin service
to Buffalo, N.Y., in early October.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest did not fly anywhere in the Northeast until 1993. That
year it added Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has said it sees a lot more growth in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   That growth is reflected in the size of the latest order.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Southwest has been one of Boeing's best and most
loyal customers. The Dallas-based carrier flies only 737s, which
helps it cut maintenance and pilot-training costs.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Aboulafia, senior aerospace analyst at the Teal Group,
tells the story of a Southwest representative who was visiting
Boeing's 737 plant in Renton, Wash., when he saw another airline's
plane on the assembly line. ``What's that plane doing in our
factory?'' the Southwest representative asked someone from Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The story may be apocryphal, but it illustrates Southwest's
longtime commitment to the 737.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's preference for the twin-engine jet began in the
early 1970s, when it took three ``white tail'' 737-200s on a
conditional sales agreement. A white tail plane is one that has
been built but has no customer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, a new 737 was delivered to Southwest. It was the
737-300, the first of what became known as the ``classic'' series
that later included the 737-400 and 737-500.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest was the launch customer for the 737-500, as well as
for the 737-700, the first of the next generation 737s. It entered
service with Southwest in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing builds four models of the next generation 737 at its
factory in Renton.
</P>
<P>
   They can fly higher, further and have much greater fuel
efficiency than the older ``classic'' 737s. The new models are the
737-600, 737-700, 737-800 and 737-900.
</P>
<P>
   As launch customer for the 737-700, Southwest ordered 63 planes
in November 1993. Not counting today's order, Southwest has ordered
142 of the next generation 737-700s, and taken delivery of 65.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the 737s in the Southwest fleet are the older-series
jets, including 32 of the 737-200 models.
</P>
<P>
   These older jets are being replaced by the new 737-700s.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest will be operating 342 Boeing 737s by the end of the
year, a spokeswoman said.

BOY SCOUTS CAN BAR GAY MEN FROM BEING TROOP LEADERS, HIGH COURT
RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS New information; expands by 1,000 words)   
(EDS: complete text is available from The New York Times on the
Web: www.nytimes.com) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday by a 5-4 vote
that the Boy Scouts have a constitutional right to exclude gay
members because opposition to homosexuality was part of the
organization's ``expressive message.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision overturned a ruling last year by the New Jersey
Supreme Court that applied the state's law against discrimination
in public accommodations to require a New Jersey troop to readmit a
lifelong member and assistant scoutmaster, James Dale, whom it had
dismissed after learning he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court Wednesday, Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist said that the court intended neither to approve nor
disapprove the Boy Scouts' view of homosexuality, but that the
First Amendment's protection for freedom of association meant that
the state could not compel the 6.2-million member organization ``to
accept members where such acceptance would derogate from the
organization's expressive message.''
</P>
<P>
   He said ``Dale's presence in the Boy Scouts would, at the very
least, force the organization to send a message, both to the youth
members and the world, that the Boy Scouts accepts homosexual
conduct as a legitimate form of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The four dissenters did not object to the general principle that
an organization cannot be forced to adopt or incorporate an
unwanted message _ a principle the court applied unanimously five
years ago in upholding the right of the Boston St. Patrick's Day
parade organizers to exclude a group that sought to march under a
banner of Irish gay pride.
</P>
<P>
   But the dissenters objected strenuously to that principle's
application in this case, because they said the majority had done
little more than accept at face value the Boy Scouts' assertion of
the central importance of its opposition to homosexuality. But
except in briefs filed in this and other cases defending their
membership policy, the Boy Scouts had never made the ``clear,
unequivocal statement necessary to prevail'' on a claim that
homosexuality was fundamentally incompatible with the
organization's mission, the dissenters said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's majority opinion was joined by Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
Justice John Paul Stevens filed the main dissenting opinion, joined
by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer and David H.
Souter, who also filed a dissenting opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In permitting the Boy Scouts' First Amendment interests to trump
New Jersey's anti-discrimination law, the majority relied heavily
on its 1995 St. Patrick's Day parade case, in which the gay
marchers had claimed the protection of a Massachusetts civil rights
law. Both that decision and the ruling Wednesday indicated that the
court would continue to weigh on a case-by-case basis the competing
claims of a private organization's right to exclude unwanted
participation and a public policy against discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The majority Wednesday drew a distinction between this decision
and a trio of Supreme Court rulings from the 1980s rejecting the
arguments of all-male organizations, including the Rotary Club and
the Jaycees, that they had a First Amendment right to exclude
women.
</P>
<P>
   The court held in those cases that because the exclusion of
women was not part of the shared goal or expressive message of
those organizations, the application of state civil rights laws to
require the admission of women did not place an unconstitutional
burden on the members' right of association.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the court's free association cases have dealt with
exclusion by private organizations on the basis of race, that
analysis would presumably permit a white supremacy group to exclude
blacks if racial exclusion was an inherent part of the group's
identity and message.

</P>
<P>
   In his opinion, Boy Scouts of America vs. Dale, No. 99-699,
Rehnquist quoted from various Boy Scouts publications and
explanations of the policy, noting that although the terms
``morally straight'' and ``clean'' in the Scout Oath and Law ``are
by no means self-defining,'' Boy Scouts officials interpreted them
as statements of opposition to homosexuality. ``We accept the Boy
Scouts' assertion'' and ``need not inquire further,'' the chief
justice said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Harlow, deputy legal director of the Lambda Legal Defense
Fund in New York, said Wednesday the Boy Scouts had won only a
``hollow, pyrrhic victory'' because in order to win the case, it
had to demonstrate to the court's satisfaction the centrality of
its opposition to homosexuality. ``The Boy Scouts have fought long
and hard for something that has marginalized their institution,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Wolfson, another lawyer with the Lambda organization, who
represented Dale before the court, said the decision ``requires you
to declare yourself an institution with an anti-gay message, and we
don't think there are many organizations in this day and age
willing to declare themselves as that.''
</P>
<P>
   In his dissenting opinion, Stevens noted several newspaper
articles from the past few weeks that described a gay pride day at
the Central Intelligence Agency, a New England boarding school's
acceptance of openly gay couples as dormitory parents, and the
extension of benefits to gay partners by the major automobile
makers. ``The past month alone has witnessed some remarkable
changes in attitudes about homosexuals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist responded to that observation. ``Indeed, it appears
that homosexuality has gained greater societal acceptance,'' he
said. ``But this is scarcely an argument for denying First
Amendment protection to those who refuse to accept these views.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement posted on its web site, the Boy Scouts said that
as a private organization, it ``must have the right to establish
its own standards of membership if it is to continue to instill the
values of the Scout Oath and Law in boys.'' The statement
continued: ``Thanks to our legal victories, our standards of
membership have been sustained. We believe an avowed homosexual is
not a role model for the values espoused in the Scout Oath and
Law.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on the distinctions between this case and the earlier
rulings on all-male clubs, the chief justice said that to claim the
First Amendment's protection, ``a group must engage in some form of
expression, whether it be public or private.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said in dissent that the majority's distinction was
unpersuasive because just as the all-male clubs had not made the
exclusion of women a central goal, ``there is no shared goal or
collective effort to foster a belief about homosexuality'' in the
Boy Scouts, ``let alone one that is significantly burdened by
admitting homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens continued: ``The only apparent explanation for the
majority's holding, then, is that homosexuals are simply so
different from the rest of society that their presence alone _
unlike any other individual's _ should be singled out for special
First Amendment treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The civic and cultural standing of the Boy Scouts, the
``sincerity'' of which the majority opinion noted in several
places, may have had more to do with the outcome of the case
thanDale's sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The case attracted dozens of briefs, a number depicting this
legal battle _ which the Boy Scouts have been waging in courts
around the country for 20 years _ as the cutting edge of the
current culture wars.
</P>
<P>
   Dale was an Eagle Scout and popular member and then assistant
leader of the troop he had joined at the age of 8 when, 12 years
later, he was ejected after his picture appeared in a New Jersey
newspaper article about a gay student conference at Rutgers, where
he was co-president of the gay and lesbian students' organization.
He brought suit under a New Jersey law that prohibits
discrimination in places of public accommodation. Because the New
Jersey Supreme Court found as a matter of state law that the Boy
Scouts fit the definition of a public accommodation, rather than a
purely private organization, that aspect of the case was not open
to the justices' re-examination.

U.S. AND RUSSIA PLAN JOINT EXERCISE OF MISSILE DEFENSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a effort to broaden their military cooperation,
Russia and the United States are planning to conduct a joint
exercise of their defenses against short- and medium-range
missiles, a senior U.S. official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to rehearse the procedures for coordinating Russian
and U.S. theater missile defenses against a common foe, U.S.
officials said. The exercise is likely to take place at Fort Bliss,
a U.S. Army post in Texas, before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Theater defenses are anti-missile systems like the Russian S-300
or the U.S. Patriot that are intended to counter short- or
medium-range missiles _ typically missiles with ranges between a
few hundred and a few thousand miles _that could threaten U.S.
troops abroad or endanger the United States' allies.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for the joint exercise does not mean that Moscow has
dropped its opposition to the Clinton administration's grander
proposal to erect a missile shield over the United States. Russia
still fears that the administration plan, which is intended to
counter intercontinental-range missiles, would give the United
States a strategic advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But theater systems have emerged as the one missile defense area
in which Washington and Moscow seem able to cooperate. It is kind
of a lowest common denominator, where each side is prepared to work
with other, albeit for their own reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are resuming our longstanding cooperation in theater
missile defense,'' a senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the exercise were discussed in talks in Washington by
senior Russian and U.S. defense officials. The broad aim of the
talks is to restore the cooperation between the two militaries that
existed before NATO's war with Yugoslavia. The two sides, for
instance, discussed a plan to have Russian peacekeepers from Kosovo
train U.S. soldiers for that mission at the United States' military
training center in Hohenfels, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian motivation to cooperate on theater missile defense
is clear. Moscow sees the Clinton administration's plan for a
national missile defense as a threat and is energetically
advocating theater missile defense as an alternative.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In meetings with U.S. officials, President Vladimir Putin of
Russia has asserted that theater defenses could be used to shoot
down enemy missiles immediately after launching, an approach that
is known in the United States as a ``boost phase'' defense. This,
the Russians suggest, could protect the United States and Europe
from threats from states like North Korea, dispensing with the need
for the administration's system, which involves the deployment of
20 missile interceptors and a battle-management radar in Alaska by
2005.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has a different motivation in seeking to cooperate
on missile defense. U.S. officials are also eager to draw the
Russians into a discussion of potential missile threats and ways to
counter them in the hope that the Kremlin' s opposition to national
missile defense might eventually wane. And they want to learn about
Russian technology.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperation itself involves a ``command post'' exercise at
Fort Bliss, the El Paso home of the 32nd Army Air and Missile
Defense Command, according to a United States official. That means
that Russian and U.S. officers would practice the procedures that
are needed to track enemy missiles and then coordinate and fire
Russian and U.S. anti-missile defenses. No ``enemy'' missiles would
actually be launched or shot down.
</P>
<P>
   Russians and U.S. officers have been involved in two previous
exercises _ in Moscow 1996 and in Colorado Springs in 1998 _ but
they have essentially been computer simulations. Another round of
Russian and U.S. talks is planned before the date of the command
post exercise is formally set; it is expected to be held in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an attempt to move out of institute and simulations
into the field,'' said a U.S. official said. ``It is still a
simulation but under more realistic field conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., a lawmaker influential on missile
defense, said the Pentagon had been too slow to cooperate with the
Russians on theater defense, in part because the administration was
initially opposed to the idea of a national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have been doing this all along,'' Weldon said in a
telephone interview. ``We have sent the wrong signals to the
Russians, and now they wonder why we want to get them involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Weldon recently met with Russia's deputy defense minister,
Nikolai Mikhailov, who told him that Moscow was interested in
working with the Americans in developing a new system, the S-500.
But Mikhailov did not describe that system in any detail.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Russians and the Americans discuss cooperation on
theater systems, Russia's generals have insisted that their
opposition to national missile defense will not recede. They have
publicly threatened to undertake a variety of countermeasures if
the Clinton administration moves ahead with plans for a missile
shield. These include putting multiple warheads on their new Topol
long-range missile, withdrawing from the treaty banning
medium-range missiles and suspending inspections of other arms
accords.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. national defense ``could lead to the tearing up of all
treaties and the withdrawal from joint inspections of nuclear
weapons,'' Col. Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev, the commander of Russia's
strategic rocket force, wrote in the government newspaper
Rossiiskaya Gazeta. ``Isn't it useful for Americans to note what is
going on here?''

IRAQI GUNMAN KILLS 2 IN HOSTAGE SIEGE AT U.N. OFFICE IN BAGHDAD 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ An Iraqi man brandishing two machine guns and
explosives shot his way into a U.N. office Wednesday in Baghdad,
Iraq, killing two officials, wounding seven and taking some 50
hostages. After a siege of nearly three hours, he gave himself up
and said he had taken the hostages to demand an end to U.N.
sanctions against his country.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials, who later made the man available to reporters
and television cameras, identified him as Fuad Hussein Haider, 38,
a car mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   But the demands he made and the fact that Iraqi citizens do not
normally have access to automatic weapons in a country that is very
tightly policed raised questions among diplomats and some officials
here about possible complicity of the Iraqi government or one of
its many security services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason is the embargo, the death and murder of thousands
of Iraqi children and elderly,'' Haider told reporters after the
event in an unusual news conference in Baghdad. ``I wanted to relay
a message, to explain the tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said that Haider had demanded the resumption of
now banned civilian flights between Baghdad and Amman, Jordan; an
increase in food rations distributed under the ``oil-for-food''
program; an end to American and British sorties over no-flight
zones in northern and southern Iraq, and compensation for Iraqis
who have suffered because of them; and the installation outside
U.N. headquarters of a statue in memory of Iraqi children who died
because of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Benon Sevan, who directs the Iraqi oil-sales program from New
York and is also in charge of U.N. staff security, told reporters
that the gunman first tried to enter the oil-sales program's
offices at the edge of Baghdad in a heavily fortified former hotel
school shared with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   When Haider could not get into that building, he went to the
offices of the Food and Agricultural Organization in a wealthy
residential neighborhood near Baghdad University.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi police and officials of the Food and Agricultural
Organization said Haider began to fire in the office reception area
on the ground floor, then went upstairs and continued shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Haider told a different story to reporters in Baghdad. He said
that he did not shoot first, but was fired at by Iraqi guards in
the building. ``When the guards opened fire on me, I started
shooting indiscriminately,'' Haider said. ``I wanted to take
foreigners working in this organization as hostages.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was prepared to die, as many other Iraqis had died
since sanctions were imposed in 1990 after Saddam Hussein's
invasion of Kuwait, and that he had been persuaded to surrender by
an Iraqi official.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations identified the dead as Yusuf Abdilleh, a
Somali administrative officer, and Marewan Mohammed Hassan, an
Iraqi hired to maintain a computer data base.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Agricultural Organization, based in Rome, works
with the oil-sales program both in areas controlled by the Iraqi
government and in autonomous Kurdish regions, where the United
Nations takes direct charge of relief projects.
</P>
<P>
   Among the seven injured in the building were a Nepali consultant
and four government-supplied guards. Sevan said that 50 hostages
were being held at one point. There was no explanation for why it
took the government more than two hours to send police
reinforcements to free them.

<P>
   REDWOOD SHORES, Calif. _ In a raucous news conference on a
sprawling Silicon Valley corporate campus affectionately dubbed
Larryland by its inhabitants, Larry Ellison, the chairman and
founder of Oracle Corp., Wednesday defended his company's yearlong
spying operation against Microsoft Corp. as a ``civic duty''
similar to investigative reporting by the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we did was to try to take information that was hidden and
bring it into the light,'' Ellison said. ``I don't think that's
arrogance. That's a public service.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison's remarks came a day after Oracle acknowledged hiring a
detective agency in Washington, D.C., to document ties between
Microsoft and three advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference, at the end of a previously scheduled
product announcement, was marked by Ellison's determined defense of
his business ethics and of his company's behavior as an appropriate
method for combating Microsoft's business tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The hour-long session took on a surreal quality as questions
about whether Ellison's behavior was ``Nixonian'' were interspersed
with inquiries about Oracle's products, principally related to
databases, and the company's market share in the Internet software
business.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison repeatedly asserted that the spying operation was
justified by Microsoft's own tactics, which recently led a federal
judge who heard the antitrust case against the company, Thomas
Penfield Jackson, to rule that Microsoft should be broken up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we're alone in this,'' Ellison said. ``The
Justice Department felt the need to investigate this company,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The 55-year-old software entrepreneur, whose wealth has come
close in recent months to rivaling that of Bill Gates, the chairman
of Microsoft, said his company had done nothing wrong in
commissioning the investigation, which came to light this month
after a failed attempt by the detective agency to buy the trash of
the Association for Competitive Technology, a Washington-based
lobbying firm favoring Microsoft ally.
</P>
<P>
   Two other groups backing Microsoft in the antitrust case, the
Independent Institute and the National Taxpayers Union, were also
targets of the Oracle-sponsored investigation, which began last
June. Documents showing Microsoft's financial support for those
groups were later cited in articles in The New York Times and The
Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   In acknowledging on Tuesday that it had paid for the
investigation, Oracle declared, ``Left undisclosed, these Microsoft
front groups could have improperly influenced one of the most
important antitrust cases in U.S. history.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Ellison said he accepts complete responsibility
for the effort, but added that he had not known until Tuesday about
the tactics involved or even the name of the detective agency. The
agency, Investigative Group International, is headed by Terry
Lenzner, a former Watergate investigator who has also worked for
President Clinton's lawyers and the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't spend a lot of my time planning the
investigation,'' Ellison said. ``We have a group in Washington that
looked after that. Believe it or not, I spend most of my time
worrying about our e-business suite, our applications server and
our database server.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, who has long deflected controversy with combative
humor, insisted that he had nothing to hide. And he challenged
Microsoft to undertake its own investigation of Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will ship them our garbage,'' he said. ``We will ship our
garbage to Redmond, and they can go through it. We believe in full
disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Wash., were
quick to rise to the bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing more disturbing than Oracle's behavior is their
on-going attempt to justify these actions,'' Microsoft said in a
statement. `` Ellison now appears to acknowledge that he was
personally aware of and personally authorized the broad overall
strategy of a covert operation against a variety of trade
associations.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's statement noted that Oracle had financed its own
share of lobbying groups, including ProComp, the Progress and
Freedom Foundation, the Software and Information Industry
Association and the Computer and Communications Industry
Association _ all of which have taken stands against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said Microsoft's top executives, including Gates and
CEO Steve Ballmer, were in an all-day executive retreat and were
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The verbal fencing between Oracle and Microsoft is only likely
to sharpen as they compete with increasingly parallel industry
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Microsoft introduced its vision of Internet-based
computing that it called its Microsoft.NET strategy. Gates said it
would take years for all the products in the strategy to reach the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle executives responded Wednesday by saying that their
company already had a complete line of software for Web-based
computing. Both Ellison and his chief marketing executive, Gary
Bloom, said Microsoft's strategy should actually be called
Microsoft.NOT, as in ``not yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison said he did not communicate frequently with either Gates
or Ballmer. He showed a particular dislike for the two Microsoft
executives and the company they have built into the world's largest
independent software developer.

SUPREME COURT RULES AGAINST BAN ON `PARTIAL-BIRTH' ABORTIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, in a split vote, struck down a
Nebraska ban on so-called ``partial birth'' abortions, stirring up
a near decade-old debate that immediately spilled into the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The court, in a 5-4 ruling, said the Nebraska law placed an
undue burden on a woman's right to end a pregnancy. About 30 states
have laws prohibiting the practice. Texas, which has no such law,
had filed a legal brief with the justices urging them to uphold
Nebraska's prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   The justices also decided in a separate case to uphold a
Colorado law that restricts protests near medical clinics. The
court said the statute, designed to stop abortion protesters from
closing in on visitors to the clinics, did not violate abortion
opponents' free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League and
other supporters of abortion rights hailed the decisions.
Opponents, such as the Family Research Council and the National
Right to Life Committee, decried the rulings as unjust.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the courtroom, the court's pronouncements reflected the
raging national disagreement over abortion rights as justices
forcefully expressed their views during an emotionally charged
final public day of their 1999-2000 term.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Stephen G. Breyer and John Paul Stevens, who wrote the
majority opinions in the two cases, called the differences between
abortion-rights supporters and opponents irreconcilable.
Nevertheless, they asserted that the Constitution gives women the
right to choose abortion free of undue legal burdens and harassing
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   But Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia, who oppose a
constitutional right to abortion, took the unusual and deeply
symbolic step of reading portions of their dissents from the bench.
Justices recite dissents only in cases in which they have profound
philosophical differences with the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Scalia each took the court to task for ignoring the
rights of abortion protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The court's 5-4 decision striking down the Nebraska law marked
the justices' first consideration of the controversial
partial-birth abortion procedure. The rare surgery involves
partially removing a fetus, legs first, from the womb into the
birth canal, where its skull is pierced and its contents drained.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of abortion rights first dubbed the procedure
``partial-birth,'' but the term has gained wide use, even by
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has twice passed legislation calling for a ban on the
practice, but President Clinton has vetoed those measures.
Republican House leaders vowed to keep pressing for a federal
prohibition, despite the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee
for president, said he was disappointed with the court's decision
and vowed to fight for a federal ban, if elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``States should have the right to enact reasonable laws and
restrictions, particularly concerning the brutal practice of
partial-birth abortion,'' Bush said. ``The American people can take
steps to protect children who are in the process of being born, and
they should have that right.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, an abortion-rights supporter and Bush's
likely Democratic opponent, hailed the court's decision but said a
single vacancy on the court could change things. The next
president, in the likely event that a vacancy occurs, could tilt
the direction of the court by appointing a new justice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidential election will decide the future of the
Supreme Court and that in turn will decide whether or not we will
keep a woman's right to choose or see it taken away,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a supporter of abortion rights, lauded the court for
striking down Nebraska's prohibition, calling it ``the only
decision it could reach consistent with Roe vs. Wade,'' the 1973
decision that gave women the constitutional right to choose
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The court, in ruling against the Nebraska statute, did not
address the constitutionality of the procedure. Rather the
justices, in an opinion by Breyer, said the Nebraska law was so
broadly written that it criminalized not only the controversial
surgery but more conventional procedures protected under the
court's prior abortion decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result is an undue burden upon a woman's right to make an
abortion decision,'' Breyer said. ``We must consequently find the
statute unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who performed abortions in violation of the Nebraska law
could have been sentenced to prison for up to 20 years, fined up to
$25,000 and have their state medical licenses revoked.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Breyer's opinion in Stenberg vs. Carhart were Stevens
and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, David H. Souter and Ruth Bader
Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, in his vociferous dissent before a hushed courtroom,
publicly assailed the court's decision as ``indefensible'' as he
likened the partial birth abortion procedure to infanticide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abortion is a unique act, in which a woman's exercise of
control over her own body ends, depending on one's view, human life
or potential human life,'' Thomas said. ``Nothing in the federal
Constitution deprives the people of this country of the right to
determine when the consequences of abortion to the fetus and to
society outweigh the burden of an unwanted pregnancy on the mother.
Although a state may permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution
dictates that a state must do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Thomas' dissent were Scalia and Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, an abortion-rights
supporter, wrote a separate dissent in which he said the
partial-birth abortion procedure does not interfere with a woman's
constitutional right to terminate pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, the court upheld, 6-3, Colorado's statute
restricting protests within 100 feet of medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, people cannot come within 8 feet of another
person to engage in ``protest, education or counseling'' without
that individual's consent. Violators can be fined $750 and
imprisoned for up to six months, though no one has been prosecuted
under the 1993 statute.
</P>
<P>
   The court, in an opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens, called
the law a legitimate exercise of the state's ability to set neutral
criteria for the time, place and manner of public protest while not
trampling on the constitutional right of people to express their
views.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statute's restriction seeks to protect those who enter a
healthcare facility from the harassment, the nuisance, the
persistent importuning, the following, the dogging and the implied
threat of physical touching that can accompany an unwelcome
approach . . . by a person wishing to argue vociferously
face-to-face and perhaps thrust an undesired handbill upon her.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Stevens' opinion in Hill vs. Colorado were Rehnquist,
O'Connor, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   In dissent, portions of which he read to a hushed courtroom,
Scalia assailed the court's ``remarkable'' conclusion that the
Colorado law is not intended to silence abortion protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is before us, after all, is a speech regulation directed
against the opponents of abortion, and it therefore enjoys the
benefit of the ad hoc machine that the court has set in motion to
push aside whatever doctrines of constitutional law stand in the
way of that highly favored practice,'' Scalia wrote in a dissent
Thomas joined.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow dissenting Justice Kennedy, who also read from the bench,
said the court was shortchanging the free-speech rights of abortion
protesters.

CREDIT CARD ISSUER AGREES TO DEMAND TO REPAY MILLIONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Va.)  By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the nation's large credit-card companies
agreed Wednesday to a demand from bank regulators to reimburse its
customers at least $300 million for misleading and improperly
billing them.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators accused the Providian Financial Corp., the
nation's seventh-largest issuer of credit cards, of misleading
hundreds of thousands of consumers, many of them with credit
problems, with phone calls and mass mailings full of confusing
sales pitches. As a result, people paid annual fees when they had
been told there were none, received credit cards they did not know
they had signed up for and were subjected to higher interest rates
than the company had advertised, according to the government, which
conducted a yearlong investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Providian signed a joint agreement with the federal comptroller
of the currency, the attorney general of California and the San
Francisco district attorney's office, in which it agreed to halt
the practices objected to by regulators.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 million of Providian's 13 million customers are likely
to receive reimbursement checks later this year, regulators said.
In addition to the $300 million in reimbursements, which regulators
called a minimum, Providian will pay a $5.5 million fine to the San
Francisco district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates said the $300 million in restitution was one
of the largest they knew of in a case involving consumer deception.
It is 10 times larger than the amount Wall Street analysts had
expected and, after taxes, will wipe out the equivalent of more
than one-third of Providian's 1999 profits.
</P>
<P>
   The bank, which is based in San Francisco, was the nation's
fastest-growing issuer of credit cards over the 12 months ended
March 31, increasing the size of its portfolio _ which is chiefly
credit card debt _ by 54 percent, according to Friedman Billings
Ramsey, an investment banking firm in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Providian focuses its marketing on the growing number of
Americans who have credit problems, and is known for its
sophisticated use of databases in singling out potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which regulators said began because of complaints from
Providian customers, also offers the latest evidence of a growing
consumer backlash against credit card companies struggling to
maintain their profit margins. So many consumers have complained
about receiving their bills too close to the payment deadline to
avoid a late fee, for example, that the comptroller began an
investigation into the practice earlier this year. Bank One's giant
First USA credit card unit has received the most complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providian has engaged in a pattern of abusing consumers by
misleading them,'' said Daniel P. Stipano, the director of
comptroller's enforcement and compliance division.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement, Providian, whose credit card operation
is led by David R. Alvarez, neither acknowledged nor denied
breaking the law, but did agree to change its practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we thought seriously about fighting'' the government,
Shailesh Mehta, Providian's chief executive, said Wednesday in a
conference call with reporters. ``This was purely a business
decision'' based on the calculation that litigation would have cost
more than the settlement, Mehta added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In recent months, the number of consumer complaining to the
comptroller's office about Providian's practices has declined
significantly, Mehta said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement comes as bank regulators, state officials and
members of Congress are vowing to look more closely at predatory
lending, particularly to people with a bad credit history or low
income.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an historic occasion,'' said June D. Cravett, the head
of the consumer and environmental protection unit of the San
Francisco district attorney's office, because it indicates that
federal regulators are now concerned with the banks' treatment of
their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the current government efforts against this sort of
fraud focus on confusing, high-interest home-equity loans that are
pitched to people who often have few other lines of credit open to
them and can lose their houses if they default. In 1994, Congress
passed a law to stop banks from offering the deceptive loans, but
regulators have since warned that the law has had little effect.
The Federal Reserve recently formed a multiagency task force that
is studying ways to curb predatory lending.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates said the Providian settlement showed that
home-equity loans were not the only worrisome practice in the
so-called subprime lending market. ``People who don't have good
credit are preyed upon in all sorts of areas _ when they try to get
a credit card, when they try to get a home-equity loan, when they
try to get a mortgage on a house,'' said Frank Torres, the
legislative counsel at Consumers Union, an advocacy group that
publishes Consumer Reports. The case also reflects a new level of
aggressiveness among bank regulators, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Te government's agreement with Providian is the first time
regulators have punished a company by using the Federal Trade
Commission Act, Stipano said. The act gives the government wider
latitude to investigate marketing practices, as opposed to solely
the details of a written contract, than the laws regulators have
traditionally used.
</P>
<P>
   In its agreement with Providian, the comptroller described
selling pitches that one regulator compared to a Catch 22.
</P>
<P>
   In one pitch, Providian boasted of charging no annual fee but
then required customers to pay $156 a year for credit protection,
the government said. If, after seeing the charge, they asked not to
receive the protection, they were then charged an annual fee.
</P>
<P>
   In another, Providian telemarketers, working from scripts,
refused to tell people what interest rate they would receive no
matter how many times they were asked. Instead, the employees would
repeat, using slightly varied language, the idea that Providian
would significantly beat a consumer's current interest rate. In
fact, the difference was usually slight and, because of the
complicated rules, often ended up being higher, Stipano said.
</P>
<P>
   To make the payments to customers, Providian said it would use
$36 million of cash reserves and take a $163 million charge.
Because restitution is tax deductible, it will not show up as a
$300 million loss on the company's earnings report.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when Providian announced the likely size of a
settlement, its stock fell more than 10 percent. Wednesday, it
gained $2, to $85, as investors were cheered by the news that the
case is now largely over, said Todd Pitsinger, an analyst at
Friedman Billings Ramsey.

BATTLE OVER RUSSIAN ENERGY CONCERN MOVES TO KREMLIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABRINA TAVERNISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A battle over Unified Energy Systems, Russia's
electricity monopoly, intensified on Wednesday after a group of
foreign investors who oppose a plan to overhaul the company took
their case to the Kremlin. The government controls more than half
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Investors representing about 15 percent of the company's stock
met with Alexander Voloshin, the Kremlin chief of staff. Voloshin,
an important figure in President Vladimir Putin's administration,
is also chairman of Unified Energy's board.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came a week after disenchanted investors asked Putin
to stop the restructuring plan, which they say would destroy the
value of their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over Unified Energy, the most actively traded stock
in Russia, is seen as a test of the new Putin administration's
attentiveness to foreign investors as well as its commitment to
strengthening Russia's power resources.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring plan would break up Unified Energy's vast
network of generating stations and distributors into companies that
could then be sold.
</P>
<P>
   The government has yet to formulate a position on the plan. But
its opinion is important, since it is the single largest
shareholder in Unified Energy, with a 53 percent stake. Its vote is
crucial to the fate of the plan and in any move to overrule the
plan's author, Anatoly B. Chubais, the company's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute pits investors against Chubais, architect of
Russia's privatization program and previously a favorite among
foreign investors because of his pro-Western views.
</P>
<P>
   Now, investors are criticizing Chubais for pushing ahead with a
plan they say will allow powerful local business groups to buy up
power industry assets at bargain prices. They say he has ignored
their proposals to alter the plan. In an open letter to
shareholders posted on Unified Energy's Web site Wednesday night,
Chubais replied directly to those concerns, saying, ``I am
listening, but are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Voloshin, an opponent of Chubais', wields vast power in the
Kremlin and the government. He was surprised by how strongly the
investors felt about the restructuring, a person close to the
situation said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Voloshin's position is still unclear, government
opposition could halt Chubais' plan, or more seriously, threaten
his position in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais presented a revised plan last week, but investors say it
was little changed from an earlier version. They say the plan is
still too vague on how regional energy companies will be split off
from the main grid. Investors want regional companies merged and
sold as larger units.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais does not need the approval of shareholders to begin
carrying out the plan, although he has pledged to show it to
investors first.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, shareholders amended the company charter to require a
75 percent vote to oust Chubais, who became chief executive of the
company in 1998. Investors have threatened to call an emergency
shareholders' meeting in July and possibly attempt an ouster. The
government and foreign investors together represent more than 80
percent of the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Unified Energy stock is trading about 11.5 cents a share, down
about 40 percent since the end of March, just before Chubais first
formulated the restructuring plan. Russia's benchmark stock index
is down about 24 percent over the same period.

WORLDCOM AND SPRINT NOW SEEN AS TAKEOVER TARGETS FOR RIVALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURA M. HOLSON   and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WorldCom and Sprint Corp. have not yet called off their merger,
but already the rumors are swirling about who might try to buy
either company.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, no doubt telecommunications executives around the
globe huddled with their advisers to figure out what the Justice
Department's opposition to the WorldCom-Sprint merger might mean
for them.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, all they can do is wonder.
</P>
<P>
   By contract, neither Sprint nor WorldCom can talk to other
parties until their merger agreement is terminated or unless both
companies agree to third-party discussions. Neither Sprint nor
WorldCom would comment Wednesday, but after the Justice Department
filed suit on Tuesday to block their merger, it is widely assumed
that the companies will call off the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The probability is high,'' said a person close to the two
companies' discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, too, are betting that the deal will fall apart.
WorldCom's stock price was up $4.875, to close at $44.5625
Wednesday. Sprint's stock fell $5.625, closing at $52.75.
</P>
<P>
   And while Sprint, in particular, is seen as a potential takeover
target, ``no one is entirely safe,'' said Adam Quinton, a
telecommunications analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``The evolution of the
industry is that if it was compelling to hook up 12 months ago, it
is even more so now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean competitors are ready to rush in just yet,
though. Executives close to Atlanta-based BellSouth, the regional
phone company that lost a bidding war to WorldCom for Sprint last
October, said that BellSouth was sitting tight for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the world looks different than it did last fall.
BellSouth, for one, now has a joint venture with SBC Communications
to combine their wireless operations. Such a deal, analysts said,
makes it less pressing for BellSouth to own Sprint's wireless
operations. And BellSouth, primarily a local telephone company,
does not yet have approval to sell long-distance service _ another
drawback.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect BellSouth to wait to see if a foreign buyer,
particularly the cash-rich Deutsche Telekom of Germany, makes a run
at either Sprint or WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Sommer, Deutsche Telekom's chairman, said two weeks ago that
he expected to have a war chest of about $100 billion to pay for
his entry into the United States. Just this week, Deutsche Telekom
raised $14.5 billion in the largest corporate bond offering ever.
Recently, Deutsche Telekom's Internet arm, T-Online, had an initial
public offering in which it raised more than $30 billion. And the
parent company plans to issue an additional 1.5 billion shares in
the next five year to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom failed to secure an American beachhead earlier
this year when talks between it and Qwest Communications
International Inc., the Denver-based telecommunication carrier,
collapsed. The talks hit a snag when US West, which was in the
midst of closing its own merger with Qwest, objected to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   US West did not like the fact that its shareholders would have
received a significantly lower premium for their shares than
shareholders of Qwest. The Qwest-US West merger received approval
from the Federal Communications Commission on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Deutsche Telekom said the company might be
particularly interested in Sprint, in which it already owns a stake
of about 10 percent, because the deal would give the German company
both a fixed-line and wireless network in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts have pointed to Sprint's wireless network as its
crown jewel, and possibly a property that could be sold
independently of Sprint's fixed-line business, executives close to
several major European telephone companies mulling an offer for
Sprint disagreed. These executives said that Sprint was more likely
to be acquired whole because of the increasing importance placed on
a strategy that combines both businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom wants to make an acquisition United States by
the end of the year, according to executives close to the company,
and the company has held internal meetings in the last week to
discuss their options now that WorldCom's acquisition of Sprint
looks doomed. If the German company goes after Sprint, Qwest's
lingering hopes of an eventual combination with Deutsche Telekom
would be dashed.
</P>
<P>
   But if Deutsche Telekom decides not to make a play for Sprint,
executives close to the company said it might return to the
bargaining table with the merged Qwest-US West, or possibly look at
Global Crossing Ltd., an undersea fiber optic cable operator with
which it has already held informal talks. An executive close to
Deutsche Telekom said it was just a matter of time before the
company pounced _ with the only question being in which direction.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom is also seen as a
formidable overseas contender to acquire either WorldCom or Sprint,
although again Sprint is the more realistic target. WorldCom's size
is such that if it merged with France Telecom, or even Deutsche
Telekom, WorldCom might end up with the controlling interest.
</P>
<P>
   Like Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom already owns approximately
10 percent of Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   France Telecom has its own ambitions to do business in the
United States, although analysts said it might not have the cash or
stock to unilaterally make a deal. But Sprint is particularly
attractive to France Telecom, which recently acquired Orange,
Britain's third-largest wireless telephone company. Orange,
combined with Sprint, could become a worldwide brand.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to France Telecom also said the company had
recently analyzed the feasibility of making a bid for AT&AMP;T, whose
stock is slumping. The French company went so far as calculating
what the value of AT&AMP;T might be if it were broken up, this person
said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts see Nippon Telegraph and Telephone of Japan as another
possible bidder. It has the money and its wireless arm operates
I-mode, the most advanced wireless network in the world, which
might make Sprint an attractive potential fit.
</P>
<P>
   Any foreign effort to acquire Sprint or WorldCom could meet
political resistance in this country. But analysts predict that
regulators would not block a deal soley on foreign-ownership
grounds.

HIGH COURT BACKS U.S. FINANCING OF RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS' EQUIPMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Overturning two of its own precedents that had
limited public aid to religious schools, the Supreme Court ruled
Wednesday that a federal program that placed computers and other
``instructional equipment'' in parochial school classrooms did not
violate the constitutional separation between church and state.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 decision was not supported by a single majority opinion:
a far-reaching opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas that would have
made ``the principles of neutrality and private choice'' the only
touchstones for channeling aid to religious schools was supported
by three other justices but was qualified by Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor's insistence in a concurring opinion that public aid may
supplement but must not supplant money that the religious school
could otherwise spend on its own programs.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the decision appeared likely to provide momentum
for the drive to legalize the use of vouchers for religious-school
tuition and provide ammunition for the legal argument that as long
as aid is distributed even-handedly, it cannot be said to be
impermissibly favoring religious recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see six potential votes for school choice,'' said Clint
Bolick, litigation director of the Institute for Justice, a leading
advocacy group on the issue, on Wednesday. His count included
Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who voted with O'Connor, as well as the
three who voted with Thomas: Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, although the voucher debate was quite obviously in
the justices' minds, that outcome remained in the realm of
potential, given O'Connor's observation that in the case before the
court Wednesday, no government funds ``ever reach the coffers of a
religious school.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Barry Lynn, director of Americans United for the
Separation of Church and State, said in an interview that ``in the
case of vouchers, the money goes directly to the school's coffers''
even though it first passes through the hands of parents. ``The
parents can do nothing with the voucher except spend it for
tuition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration supported the program that was upheld
Wednesday and appealed a decision from a federal appeals court in
New Orleans that declared it unconstitutional. Dating originally to
1965, the law, now known generally as Chapter 2, has evolved from
providing video filmstrips and similar material to a vehicle for
accomplishing the administration's goal of wiring every classroom
in the country for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, federal money flows through public school
districts, which are obligated to buy the equipment and distribute
it, technically as loans, to all schools within the district's
geographic boundaries, public, private and parochial, based on
their enrollment. Three taxpayers in Jefferson Parish, La., brought
suit in 1985 to challenge application to religious schools in the
district on the ground that there was no way of preventing the
schools from using the equipment in support of their religious
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The case had a tangled history, leading eventually to a 1998
ruling by the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, in New Orleans,
that the program was unconstitutional under two Supreme Court
precedents from the mid-1970s. Those decisions, Meek vs. Pittenger
and Wolman vs. Walter, held that the government could provide
textbooks but not other instructional materials to religious
schools, the premise being that textbooks could be vetted in
advance to make sure they did not advance the schools' religious
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The six justices who voted in the majority Wednesday to overturn
the 5th Circuit's decision all agreed that the earlier decisions
should be overruled. Thomas said the decisions were
``irreconcilable'' with other decisions in this area that came both
before and after them, most recently the court's ruling three years
ago in Agostini vs. Felton. In that decision _ which also
overturned an earlier precedent _ the court held that it did not
violate the Constitution for public schools to send teachers into
parochial schools, under a federal program, to provide remedial
classes.
</P>
<P>
   As these decisions indicate, the court's jurisprudence on the
subject of permissible public aid to religious schools has been in
turmoil for years. Wednesday's case, Mitchell vs. Helms, No.
98-1648, was by far the oldest case on the court's docket, having
been argued Dec. 1, and the failure of the justices to settle on a
single majority opinion after seven months shows that the turmoil
is likely to continue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reflecting on historical anti-Catholic sentiment in the late
1800s, Thomas said that ``hostility to aid to pervasively sectarian
schools has a shameful pedigree that we do not hesitate to
disavow.'' He said that ``nothing in the Establishment Clause
requires the exclusion of pervasively sectarian schools from
otherwise permissible aid programs'' and the cases that supported
such exclusion, ``born of bigotry, should be buried now.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that government programs should be upheld on ``the
principles of neutrality and private choice,'' meaning that if the
government ``offers aid on the same terms, without regard to
religion,'' no impermissible religious purpose can be attributed to
the government. That was especially true, he said, when individuals
can make their own private choices on how to use the aid.
</P>
<P>
   It was at this point that O'Connor and Breyer expressed their
unease with what O'Connor called the ``logic'' of Thomas' opinion.
``The plurality opinion foreshadows the approval of direct monetary
subsidies to religious organizations, even when they use the money
to advance their religious objectives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In his dissenting opinion, Souter, joined by Stevens and
Ginsburg, said Thomas' opinion represented a fundamental break with
the court's precedents. He said it threatened the court's long-held
distinction ``between indirect aid that reaches religious schools
only incidentally as a result of numerous individual choices and
aid that is in reality directed to religious schools by the
government or in practical terms selected by religious schools
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, in her concurring opinion, explained her reasons for
agreeing that the court should overturn the precedents that limited
aid to providing textbooks. ``Technology's advance,'' she said, has
made the distinction between textbooks and other materials ``more
suspect'' than ever. ``Computers are now as necessary as were
schoolbooks 30 years ago, and they play a somewhat similar role in
the educational process,'' she said.

MEXICAN ELECTION TAKES A NASTY TURN NEAR THE END 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Standing above an immense crowd in Mexico City's
central square recently, Francisco Labastida, the governing party's
presidential candidate, kept giving his followers, over and over, a
single message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to win,'' Labastida intoned. ``We are going to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is not clear, just days before the vote on Sunday,
that Labastida, the candidate of the long dominant Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, is going to win, although he may.
</P>
<P>
   Even at that big rally, his supporters were oddly dispassionate.
Most had been brought in from out of town by bus and hurriedly left
after he spoke, even skipping a free concert by Juan Gabriel, one
of Mexico's most popular singers.
</P>
<P>
   The final opinion polls, published last week, show Labastida in
a tie with Vicente Fox, the right-of-center opposition candidate.
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a leftist contender, was trailing well behind,
and millions of voters were still undecided. By law, campaigning
ended on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks PRI leaders, sensing this softness in their once
rock-hard support, have mobilized all their machinery and myriad
links to the government in a blistering campaign against Fox,
accusing him of taking illegal campaign donations from foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how the voters will react to the nasty turn in the
campaign. Never before have Mexicans faced a such a close contest
under an election agency with enhanced powers to ensure an accurate
tally.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique Jackson, a leading PRI lawmaker, electrified a
congressional hearing on June 21 by displaying a series of checks
that he said proved that Fox had received donations from people and
companies in Belgium and, far worse, the United States, Mexico's
historical adversary. Campaign laws prohibit funds from businesses
and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the checks showed that Fox was backed by ``powerful
foreign groups that have an appetite for our country.'' In fact,
the checks did not indicate the money trail from overseas to the
Fox campaign that he described. One was written a year ago, before
the campaign was officially under way.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Hakim, a businessman whose company was said to have made
contributions, produced documents to show that his transactions
were not donations to Fox. Fox filed a defamation suit on Tuesday
against the PRI, but his denials have been less potent in the press
than Jackson's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI came down hard on Ramiro Berron Lara, an engineer from
Petroleos Mexicanos, the state-owned petroleum company better known
as Pemex. He complained in the press that his superiors had tried
to make him campaign for Labastida during working hours.
</P>
<P>
   At a new conference, the director of Pemex, Rogelio Montemayor,
a PRI politician, denied that the company had leaned on any
employee to back Labastida. He described Berron as a problem
employee who was facing disciplinary action for ``distributing
pornography'' on the company's Internet network.
</P>
<P>
   Berron responded by showing a list on which he had been assigned
to register 10 Pemex employees to vote for Labastida. He said the
``pornography'' was a joke that a friend had sent on the Web and
wondered aloud why his superiors were reading his e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   In the following days, workers at one Pemex refinery complained
to the newspaper Reforma that they had been required to present
current PRI party credentials and pledge help for Labastida to
ensure their jobs and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring by the Federal Elections Institute, the government
agency that is organizing the election, showed that the broadcast
media had shifted sharply in favor of Labastida at the end of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While the two major national television networks remained more
balanced, elections officials said, the news media in the
provinces, where the hottest battle between Labastida and Fox is
being waged, strongly colored the news to benefit the PRI
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases coverage of Fox's campaign faced suppression.
Josh Tuynman, the national editor of Mexico City's English-language
newspaper, The News, said he resigned last week in protest over
instructions from the pro-PRI publishers to play down any stories
about Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Castaneda, an adviser to Fox, ended his regular
commentaries on Televisa after news officials there said he should
not continue because he had publicly suggested that they might
release inaccurate polls on election day.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's campaign has galvanized a diverse range of Mexicans who
want what they refer to, with near-religious fervor, as ``the
change,'' an end to the PRI rule. His followers' vigor showed at
the huge rally that Fox held last weekend in that same vast plaza
in downtown Mexico City. His campaign slogan is a simple ``Now!''
describing the time when his voters want to be finished with the
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox has made problems for himself. He raised doubts about
his qualities as a statesman with a show of stubbornness in a
discussion with the two other leading candidates on live television
in May, a day his supporters call ``Black Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably his most serious error was his failure to lure more
support from Cardenas, who opposes the PRI from the left. Fox grew
impatient with Cardenas' resistance to his overtures and has lashed
him a number of times with his country-talking tongue, making it
more difficult for Cardenas' voters to cross over.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, in his own teeming closing rally in the Mexico City
square last Sunday, echoed the PRI's accusations about Fox's
campaign finances and called him a liar and an ``electoral
delinquent.'' He said hardly an unkind word about Labastida.

 c.2000 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MIAMI _ The port of Miami once shone like a beacon for
hijackers, thieves and cargo rustlers. Now it has smugglers headed
for the rocks.
 &HT;    New X-ray machines screen containers for drugs and other
contraband. Shipyard trucks pass through rigorous checkpoints.
Customs inspectors are more zealous than ever. At a time when cargo
crime is up nationwide by about 20 percent to nearly US$12 billion
annually, Miami is cracking down.
 &HT;    ``The port is much better than it used to be,'' says John Hyde,
the head of security for Maersk-SeaLand, one of the leading
shipping lines for the Latin American trade lanes and one of the
leading customers at the port. ``Miami is much improved.''
 &HT;    It has to be. Many drug traffickers, FBI Special Agent Tracy
Reinhold says, are switching to cargo crime because they can make
just as much money with a lot less risk. Indeed, the penalties are
not as stiff for a container of stolen microchips compared to a
container of cocaine.
 &HT;    The entry of drug traffickers and other sophisticated criminals
_ combined with an increase in the shipping of smaller and more
expensive items, like electronic equipment _ has helped change the
face of cargo crime. It is now increasingly organized and
sophisticated. Whereas before the biggest problem was pilferage
from the back of trucks (or, in rare cases, a hijacking), current
schemes include infiltrating trucking companies to create phony
invoices or bills of lading and emptying and refilling containers
in warehouses.
 &HT;    ``It's a very liquid business,'' Reinhold says. ``They steal it
one day and it's sold within the next 72 hours. It's a constant
problem, especially for major cargo hubs, like New York, Memphis
and Miami.''
 &HT;    The increased vigilance at Miami, the busiest container U.S.
port for Latin American cargo, comes amidst a national crackdown on
cargo crime. About a year ago, the FBI started Operation Sudden
Stop, which combines the efforts of 36 task forces in 29 field
offices across the United States. The agency recently came through
with 400 arrests and indictments. ``In the early 1990s, we shifted
our efforts from property crimes to gang-related crimes,'' Special
Agent Reinhold says. ``Now we are switching back to property.''
 &HT;    Last year, federal, state and local authorities busted eight
people on charges of running an international cargo crime ring. The
group allegedly stole computer parts on demand in the Miami area
and then exported them to Latin America.
 &HT;    Despite its progress, Miami is still a hot spot for cargo theft.
That's not terribly surprising. Most cargo theft occurs during the
shift of boxes from one mode of transportation to another; Miami,
as an air, land and sea transfer point, offers more opportunities
than many other gateways. That's why Miami has to work so hard to
prevent these crimes. It operates three checkpoints that truckers
must clear before they can get their cargo, and the port takes
pictures of the drivers with the paperwork.
 &HT;    But the new watchfulness carries a price. Greater vigilance has
increased delays in moving cargo through the port. Truckers,
already riled by congestion backups and rising fuel prices,
complain that the additional slowdowns cost them cargo runs and
money _ many are paid by the number of trips they make in the port.
 &HT;    Port Director Charles A. Towsley says the facility is working on
cutting down the delays and devising ways to reimburse the trucking
companies for lost time or revenue.
 &HT;    The real key, law enforcement officials say, is getting
businesses to take more firm steps to protect against cargo crime.
They need to do a better job screening employees and tracking their
cargo, from the time it leaves the plant to the moment it reaches
its destination.
 &HT;    The FBI achieves its most effective results, Reinhold says, when
the Bureau and industry work ``hand in glove.'' Indeed, that may be
best way to keep thieves' hands off cargo.

 &HT;    MIAMI _ The port of Miami once shone like a beacon for
hijackers, thieves and cargo rustlers. Now it has smugglers headed
for the rocks.
 &HT;    New X-ray machines screen containers for drugs and other
contraband. Shipyard trucks pass through rigorous checkpoints.
Customs inspectors are more zealous than ever. At a time when cargo
crime is up nationwide by about 20 percent to nearly US$12 billion
annually, Miami is cracking down.
 &HT;    ``The port is much better than it used to be,'' says John Hyde,
the head of security for Maersk-SeaLand, one of the leading
shipping lines for the Latin American trade lanes and one of the
leading customers at the port. ``Miami is much improved.''
 &HT;    It has to be. Many drug traffickers, FBI Special Agent Tracy
Reinhold says, are switching to cargo crime because they can make
just as much money with a lot less risk. Indeed, the penalties are
not as stiff for a container of stolen microchips compared to a
container of cocaine.
 &HT;    The entry of drug traffickers and other sophisticated criminals
_ combined with an increase in the shipping of smaller and more
expensive items, like electronic equipment _ has helped change the
face of cargo crime. It is now increasingly organized and
sophisticated. Whereas before the biggest problem was pilferage
from the back of trucks (or, in rare cases, a hijacking), current
schemes include infiltrating trucking companies to create phony
invoices or bills of lading and emptying and refilling containers
in warehouses.
 &HT;    ``It's a very liquid business,'' Reinhold says. ``They steal it
one day and it's sold within the next 72 hours. It's a constant
problem, especially for major cargo hubs, like New York, Memphis
and Miami.''
 &HT;    The increased vigilance at Miami, the busiest container U.S.
port for Latin American cargo, comes amidst a national crackdown on
cargo crime. About a year ago, the FBI started Operation Sudden
Stop, which combines the efforts of 36 task forces in 29 field
offices across the United States. The agency recently came through
with 400 arrests and indictments. ``In the early 1990s, we shifted
our efforts from property crimes to gang-related crimes,'' Special
Agent Reinhold says. ``Now we are switching back to property.''
 &HT;    Last year, federal, state and local authorities busted eight
people on charges of running an international cargo crime ring. The
group allegedly stole computer parts on demand in the Miami area
and then exported them to Latin America.
 &HT;    Despite its progress, Miami is still a hot spot for cargo theft.
That's not terribly surprising. Most cargo theft occurs during the
shift of boxes from one mode of transportation to another; Miami,
as an air, land and sea transfer point, offers more opportunities
than many other gateways. That's why Miami has to work so hard to
prevent these crimes. It operates three checkpoints that truckers
must clear before they can get their cargo, and the port takes
pictures of the drivers with the paperwork.
 &HT;    But the new watchfulness carries a price. Greater vigilance has
increased delays in moving cargo through the port. Truckers,
already riled by congestion backups and rising fuel prices,
complain that the additional slowdowns cost them cargo runs and
money _ many are paid by the number of trips they make in the port.
 &HT;    Port Director Charles A. Towsley says the facility is working on
cutting down the delays and devising ways to reimburse the trucking
companies for lost time or revenue.
 &HT;    The real key, law enforcement officials say, is getting
businesses to take more firm steps to protect against cargo crime.
They need to do a better job screening employees and tracking their
cargo, from the time it leaves the plant to the moment it reaches
its destination.
 &HT;    The FBI achieves its most effective results, Reinhold says, when
the Bureau and industry work ``hand in glove.'' Indeed, that may be
best way to keep thieves' hands off cargo.

 &HT;    It's party time for pine beetles
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EATONTON, Ga. _ The voracious Southern pine beetle threatens to
lay waste to thousands of acres of Georgia's drought-stressed pine
forests, state and federal foresters warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Loblolly and short-leaf pines weakened by two years of drought
have become especially vulnerable to the insect no larger than a
grain of rice, the foresters said. The beetle infestations also are
occurring at the peak of a natural cycle in which the insect's
populations rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trigger is cocked for one of the worst pine beetle
outbreaks we've seen in years,'' said Terry Price, an entomologist
with the Georgia Forestry Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Price and other foresters are predicting the infestations this
year will be just as bad or worst than the massive outbreak during
the drought of 1988, when pine beetles killed tens of millions of
dollars worth of pines and literally changed the landscape of
portions of North Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Drought makes the trees more susceptible to the beetle because
it lowers their natural defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of beetle infestation were especially heavy on Wednesday
in the 115,000-acre Oconee National Forest in Middle Georgia, where
more than 300 stands of dead pines _ known as ``pine beetle spots''
_ have been found since April. The spots range in size from less
than an acre to several acres.
</P>
<P>
   When foresters find at least one beetle spot for every 1,000
acres of pine forests, they declare a pine beetle epidemic for the
region. ``We've certainly got an epidemic here,'' said Ron
Stephens, acting district ranger at the Oconee forest.
</P>
<P>
   Inspections of several dead pines in the forest on Wednesday
revealed the backside of the bark riddled with thread-like tunnels
_ mute evidence of the pine beetle, which strikes a tree's cambium
layer that lies just below the bark and transports water and
nutrients throughout the tree. Infected pines are killed within two
to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After laying eggs in the tunnels, the beetles emerge from the
trees and spread to other pines in the area. Immediate removal of
infested trees is necessary to prevent the larvae from further
spreading the infestation when they develop into adults.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists are especially concerned that the loss of trees in
the Oconee forest, which is about 72 percent pine, will further
imperil the red-cockaded woodpecker, considered to be Georgia's
most endangered bird. The Oconee forest is home to one of the last
remaining red-cockaded populations in the South.
</P>
<P>
   The bird is the only woodpecker that makes its nest in a living
pine _ in particular mature pines that have a wood softening fungus
that makes it easier for the tiny birds to peck out a cavity to
raise their young.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the trees that the beetles are going after,'' said
biologist Liz Caldwell of the Oconee forest. ``Every tree lost here
is a setback for these birds.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Oconee National Forest, which includes large
portions of Jones, Jasper and Putnam counties, other Georgi

 &HT;    Flores described as ``a very kind human being''
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Priests, bishops and lay people throughout Texas
prayed Wednesday for San Antonio Archbishop Patrick Flores, the
43-year Catholic cleric who has dedicated his life to promoting
peace, caring for immigrants and taking on Latino concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, the highest-ranking prelate in Texas, is known
internationally as a champion of Latinos and has created programs
for immigrants, refugees and Mexican-Americans that are considered
models across the country. He also put together an archdiocesan
television station that broadcasts Masses in Spanish throughout the
Western Hemisphere from the historic San Fernando Cathedral in
downtown San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the archbishop has lobbied heavily for anti-violence
measures, including gun control, and is an outspoken critic of the
state's concealed gun law.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, the first Mexican-American bishop in the United States,
is described as a gentle, compassionate soul who shunned security
at the the archdiocesan offices because he felt it should be open
and accessible to the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in San Antonio loves him,'' said the Rev. Edward
Maddox of Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Austin. ``He is one of
the greatest representatives for the Mexican people.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores was held hostage in the chancery Wednesday, the
archbishop's administrative headquarters where he leads his flock
of more than 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Stella Trevino of Austin was in San Antonio to see
Flores realize a dream. He hosted an archdiocesan-wide Eucharistic
Congress, which featured an array of speakers talking about the
meaning of Holy Communion. ``He always wanted to do that,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place was packed,'' she said of the gathering at Joe and
Harry Freeman Coliseum. The Roman Catholic Church is celebrating
the Year of the Eucharistic, and Flores seized the opportunity to
put together the gathering in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the archbishop received a standing ovation when
he was introduced by local Bishop John McCarthy at the Austin
diocese's confirmation celebration at the Frank Erwin Center.
Flores celebrated the first of two Masses on Pentecost Sunday where
more than 3,000 teen-agers received the Catholic sacrament that is
a rite of passage to adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Austin and the state's 13 other dioceses are part of the
Catholic Province of San Antonio, of which Flores is the head.
Flores' archdiocesan territory includes 23 Texas counties that
stretch from Hill County, north of Waco, to the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, 70, is the seventh of nine children born into a migrant
farm-working family from Ganado, north of Victoria in Jackson
County.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew what it was to get up and ride the truck to sugarbeet
fields in Minnesota and Wisconsin,'' said McCarthy, who was a
seminary classmate with Flores.
</P>
<P>
   Flores dropped out of school in the 10th grade and was working
in a Texas dance hall, cleaning up the after-hours detritus, when
it came to him that perhaps there was a better path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just thinking _ not having any visions or anything like
that _ but I said I should not go to work for smoke and stench,''
Flores said in a 1996 interview. ``That day the thought hit me
about being a priest.''
</P>
<P>
   He finished his high school education and went into the seminary
in 1949 _ the same year as McCarthy. The two were ordained into the
priesthood together in the Galveston-Houston diocese in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Flores was named auxiliary bishop in San Antonio _ the
first Mexican-American bishop. He went on to become the bishop of
El Paso in 1978 but returned to San Antonio a year later when he
was named archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage situation Wednesday wasn't Flores' first scrape with
danger. In 1976, he was attending a conference in Riobamba,
Ecuador, when armed soldiers stormed the retreat house, arresting
the 90 bishops, priests, religious and lay people attending the
event.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers, believing the retreat was some kind of clandestine
meeting to take over Ecuador's government, forced the Catholics
into army buses, driving them eight hours to the country's capital
of Quito. There, Flores and the others were detained in Army
barracks until the next day when the U.S. Embassy intervened and
got 50 foreigners released.
</P>
<P>
   Flores and the four other Americans among those were ``invited
to leave'' the country, said Tom Quigley, policy adviser on Latin
American affairs for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in
Washington, D.C., who chronicled the incident.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Flores was one of four U.S. bishops selected to attend
a special meeting of bishops at the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years before Pope John Paul II made his historic visit
to Cuba, Flores visited the Communist country in 1985 and again in
1986. The following year, Flores welcomed the pope to San Antonio.
The pontiff stayed with Flores at his residence, located on the
same chancery grounds where Flores was taken hostage Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy Wednesday described Flores as ``a very kind human
being. You can't imagine him saying anything uncomplimentary about
a person.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, Flores gave $100,000 of his money to restore San
Fernando Cathedral. ``I don't have a family to support so my
expenses are not as great as yours,'' he told the congregation,
many of whom are poor immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The donation was in keeping with Flores' personal motto: ``I
will work not for myself but for others.''

MINORITIES STILL LAG IN HOMEOWNERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn., Fla., Ga., Ore., Wash., Calif., Mass.)   By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the United States roars through the Year 2000 still in the
midst of the longest housing boom on record, there are disturbing
signs that minorities remain at the bottom of the homeownership
gap, according to a report issued this week by the Joint Center for
Housing Studies at Harvard University.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The report found that although government loan programs directed
toward minorities have increased significantly, a greater
percentage of whites than blacks own homes, creating a gap of 25.8
percent, about the same as in 1994. Hispanics, who are fast
becoming major players in the country's housing market, still fall
23 percent below whites in terms of homeownership. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Especially in such prosperous times, these problems of
affordability are ``deeply troubling,'' said Nicolas P. Retsinas,
the center's director. ``The signs are that, yes, the gap will keep
getting bigger. The history is that in good times the gaps narrow.
But in these good times _ about the best we know of _ they have
not.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, minorities are becoming a larger part of the
population. While today 75 percent of households are white, that
number will shrink to 71 percent by 2010. There will be nearly 12
million more households, and minorities _ classified in three
groups, as black, Hispanic, and Asian and others _ will make up
nearly two-thirds of that growth.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard study noted that rising housing costs create pain
for everyone, regardless of race and income. Rents have risen
across the country, significantly in the Northeast and the West
where Portland, Seattle and San Francisco have posted record rents.
</P>
<P>
   Homes cost more, and so do mortgages. Adjusted for inflation,
mortgage costs rose nearly 5 percent between 1998 and 1999. Down
payments rose 3.5 percent, for an average increase of $442. House
prices hit record highs in 15 of the nation's 39 biggest cities:
only Buffalo, Miami and Rochester saw a decline in prices. But the
study found disproportionate impacts on the poor.
</P>
<P>
   As house prices and mortgage costs rise, the poor are
experiencing increased difficulty in finding homes, not only to buy
but also to rent. Ninety-thousand federally subsidized housing
rental units have been lost since the early '90s, as landlords have
opted out of federal programs, in many cases because they want the
freedom to raise rents to market levels. Housing authorities are
also demolishing public housing projects without replacing them in
equal numbers. The stock market has made fortunes for many people.
But the biggest investment for most Americans is their home. This
is especially true among homeowners who are black or Hispanic.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the face of these statistics, Darren Walker, the chief
operating officer for the Abyssinian Development Corp., which
builds housing in Harlem, says he finds it incomprehensible that
the largest lenders in New York are not writing more loans for
African-American applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The study reported that many minorities were taking out more
expensive loans _ called subprime _ which are geared to home buyers
with poor credit. The Harvard study found that such high-interest
loans had risen fivefold from 1993 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Walker contended that minority homeowners in Harlem are the
focus of intense advertising efforts by the subprime lenders;
often, home buyers _ even those with excellent credit _ do not
realize they must pay higher interest for these subprime loans than
what would be offered by a mainstream bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers reinforce our contention that the mainstream
lenders have still not fully embraced the minority communities,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said that subprime lenders, whose interest rates are
currently 1 to 3 percentage points higher than the prevailing 8\
percent home mortgage rate, at least ``allow people who wouldn't
otherwise own a home to be able to swing it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The annual Harvard report, ``The State of the Nation's
Housing,'' poked holes in the belief that home buyers and renters
alike are increasingly drawn to center cities. While some
households choose lofts and condominiums downtown, the report found
that Americans still prefer the suburbs, often with good reason:
from 1990 to 1997, jobs in the lower-density fringes of
metropolitan areas grew 19 percent, compared with only 4 percent in
the urban core.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the report said, most minority and low-income buyers
chose the suburbs. In the Northeast, a full 72 percent of
low-income buyers bought in the suburbs, compared with 60 percent
in the West. Hartford, Atlanta and Miami were the most unpopular
cities among home buyers: 85 percent of low-income borrowers in
those markets chose not to live in their downtowns. &QL;

 &HT;    MIAMI _ Hubo una epoca en que los cacos hacian de las suyas en
el puerto de Miami. Pero las cosas han cambiado.
 &HT;    Nuevas maquinas de rayos X examinan a distancia el interior de
los contenedores en busca de drogas y otro contrabando. Los
camiones que entran al puerto pasan por varios puntos de control
rigurosos. Los inspectores de la Aduana son mas estrictos que
nunca. Y en momentos en que los delitos en los puertos de Estados
Unidos han aumentado un 20 por ciento, a casi US$12.000 millones
anuales en perdidas, Miami presenta batalla.
 &HT;    ``La situacion en el puerto ha mejorado mucho,'' dice John Hyde,
jefe de seguridad de Maersk-SeaLand, una de las mayores empresas de
transporte maritimo que cubre las rutas latinoamericanas y uno de
los principales usuarios del puerto.
 &HT;    Muchos narcotraficantes, afirma Tracy Reinhold, agente de la
Oficina Federal de Investigaciones (FBI), han comenzado a operar en
el sector del transporte de carga porque pueden ganar mucho dinero
con mucho menos riesgos: las penalidades por traficar un contenedor
de microprocesadores son mucho menores que si fuera cocaina.
 &HT;    Si antes el gran problema era el robo en menor cuantia en los
camiones, ahora los delincuentes se infiltran en las empresas de
transporte, crean facturas y documentos falsos y se dedican a
vaciar y rellenar contenedores en los almacenes.
 &HT;    ``Es un negocio muy liquido,'' explica Reinhold. ``Se roban las
cosas hoy y las venden en 72 horas. Es un problema constante para
los puertos grandes, como Nueva York, Miami y Memphis.''
 &HT;    El aumento de la vigilancia en el puerto de Miami, la mayor
terminal portuaria de Estados Unidos que maneja carga desde y hacia
Latinoamerica, se produce en medio de un ataque nacional contra
este flagelo. Hace casi un ano, el FBI inicio la operacion Sudden
Stop, que genero 400 arrestos y encausamientos. ``A principios de
los anos 90 comenzamos a dedicar mas esfuerzos a los delitos
relacionados con las pandillas y menos a los delitos contra la
propiedad,'' afirma el agente Reinhold. ``Ahora vamos en sentido
contrario.''
 &HT;    En 1999 las autoridades acusaron a ocho personas de robar
componentes de computadoras que sus clientes les pedian desde
America Latina.
 &HT;    A pesar del progreso logrado, en el puerto de Miami todavia se
roba mucha mercancia, lo que no debe sorprender.. La mayoria de los
robos ocurren durante el traslado de la carga de un medio de
transporte a otro. Y Miami, que es un punto de transbordo de carga
por tierra, mar y aire, ofrece mas oportunidades que muchos otros
puertos.
 &HT;    Por eso Miami tiene que trabajar tan duro para prevenir estos
delitos. El puerto tiene tres puntos de control por donde los
camiones deben pasar antes de llegar a la carga, y las autoridades
toman fotografias de los choferes con la documentacion.
 &HT;    Pero esta vigilancia tiene un precio: han aumentado las demoras
en el movimiento de carga. Los camioneros, ya molestos por los
problemas de congestion del trafico y el precio del combustible, se
quejan de que las demoras adicionales les cuesta dinero, porque a
muchos les pagan por los viajes que realizan.
 &HT;    Charles A. Towsley, director del puerto de Miami, afirma que la
instalacion trabaja en reducir las demoras y estudia formas de
compensar a las empresas de transporte por el tiempo y el dinero
perdidos.
 &HT;    La clave, afirman las autoridades, es lograr que las empresas
tomen medidas mas firmes para evitar los robos: necesitan
investigar mas el historial de los empleados que contratan y seguir
mejor la pista a los cargamentos desde el punto de origen hasta su
destino final.
 &HT;    El FBI consigue los mejores resultados, dice Reinhold, cuando la
industria y las autoridades trabajan mano a mano. De hecho, esa
puede ser la mejor manera de alejar a los cacos de la carga.

BOY SCOUTS CAN KEEP GAYS FROM BEING SCOUTMASTERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a setback for gay rights advocates, a divided
U.S. Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the Boy Scouts of America
has a First Amendment right to bar homosexuals from serving as
scoutmasters.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 decision, announced on the last public day of the
court's term, said New Jersey's goal of enforcing its civil rights
laws and preventing discrimination against gays is trumped by the
Scouts' constitutional right to free association and free
expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forced inclusion of an unwanted person in a group
infringes the group's freedom of expressive association if the
presence of that person affects in a significant way the group's
ability to advocate public or private viewpoints,'' Chief Justice
William Rehnquist wrote for the majority.
</P>
<P>
   While Rehnquist said the court was not endorsing the Scouts'
anti-gay views, he said making the group accept a gay Scout leader
would unfairly ``force the organization to send a message, both to
the youth members and the world, that the Boy Scouts accepts
homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The ruling reversed a unanimous decision by the New Jersey
Supreme Court, which found that the Scouts illegally fired
assistant scoutmaster James Dale, an Eagle Scout, when it
discovered through a newspaper article in 1990 that he is gay. That
court said Dale's expulsion from Troop 73 in Matawan, N.J., was
based on prejudice and was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts appealed, saying that allowing an openly gay troop
leader would undermine the group's rules calling for members and
their leaders to be ``morally straight'' and ``clean.'' But Dale
argued that he never tried to express his views on homosexuality
and pointed out that the Scouts allows pro-gay rights heterosexuals
to serve as Scout leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Dale, 29, expressed his disappointment during a news conference
in New York, where he works as an advertising director for POZ, a
magazine targeted at readers who are HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I learned anything during my years as a Scout, it was to
believe that justice will prevail,'' he said. ``America realizes
that discrimination is wrong, even if the Boy Scouts don't know
that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale's lawyer, Evan Wolfson, from the New York-based Lambda
Legal Defense and Education Fund, said the Scouts had won ``the
dubious right to be bigoted and exclusionary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have convinced the highest court in the land, and have
shown the rest of the country, that they stand for
discrimination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force also criticized the high
court's decision, which it said ``should lead no one to believe
that discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual and
transgendered people is acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We renew our call on the (Scouts) to model `moral
straightness' by ending its shameful exclusion of youth and adults
who are different,'' said Elizabeth Toledo, the group's executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   But the Scouts and other groups hailed the court's decision as a
victory for the First Amendment and for private organizations
seeking to maintain control of their membership criteria and
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe an avowed homosexual is not a role model for the
values espoused in the Scout Oath and Law,'' the Irving,
Texas-based Boy Scouts said in a statement posted on its Web site.
``We respect other people's right to hold differing opinions and
ask that they respect ours.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``It is not the role of government to decide who should share a
pup tent with the Scouts, who is fit to be a scoutmaster, and what
message the Scouts should deliver about homosexuality,'' said Jan
LaRue, senior director of legal studies for the Family Research
Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Supreme Court had ruled the other way, it could have
forced the NAACP to accept a Ku Klux Klan member, the B'Nai Brith
to accept Catholics, and the Knights of Columbus to accept Jews as
members and leaders,'' she added. ``Every private association would
have had to look like and believe whatever the government said.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Shackelford, chief counsel of the Liberty Legal Institute,
which filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case, said Americans
are ``safer and freer'' now that the court has ruled in the Boy
Scouts' favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Boy Scouts were not able to define themselves by their
own moral constraints,'' he said, ``then neither could any other
private association, including religious denominations and
organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   In deciding the case, Rehnquist, who was joined by Justices
Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence
Thomas, invoked a 1995 decision permitting organizers of Boston's
privately run St. Patrick's Day parade to exclude a gay rights
group from marching.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice John Paul Stevens, who dissented along with Justices
David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, said the case
was more analogous to the court's decisions requiring civic
organizations such as the Rotary Club and Jaycees to include women
members.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens wrote that the New Jersey law ``does not impose any
serious burdens'' on the Boy Scouts, ``nor does it force (the
Scouts) to communicate any message that it does not wish to
endorse.''
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that homosexuality has gained acceptance in the
United States in recent years. Rehnquist agreed, but said that's
even more reason to protect groups such as the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Amendment protects expression, be it of the popular
variety or not,'' the chief justice wrote. ``And the fact that an
idea may be embraced and advocated by increasing numbers of people
is all the more reason to protect the First Amendment rights of
those who wish to voice a different view.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who is honorary president of the Boy Scouts,
said during a news conference at the White House that the Boy
Scouts are ``a great group.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the country should continue to move toward greater
inclusion of gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the country has moved a long way, and I'm proud
of the things that we've been able to do, and I'm disappointed we
haven't been able to do more in some areas,'' he said. ``But I
think we're moving in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, spokeswoman for George W. Bush, who was on the
presidential campaign trail in Ohio, said the Texas governor
supports the decision because it is consistent with his belief that
private organizations should be able to set their own standards.

 &HT;    MIAMI _ Hubo una epoca en que los cacos hacian de las suyas en
el puerto de Miami. Pero las cosas han cambiado.
 &HT;    Nuevas maquinas de rayos X examinan a distancia el interior de
los contenedores en busca de drogas y otro contrabando. Los
camiones que entran al puerto pasan por varios puntos de control
rigurosos. Los inspectores de la Aduana son mas estrictos que
nunca. Y en momentos en que los delitos en los puertos de Estados
Unidos han aumentado un 20 por ciento, a casi US$12.000 millones
anuales en perdidas, Miami presenta batalla.
 &HT;    ``La situacion en el puerto ha mejorado mucho,'' dice John Hyde,
jefe de seguridad de Maersk-SeaLand, una de las mayores empresas de
transporte maritimo que cubre las rutas latinoamericanas y uno de
los principales usuarios del puerto.
 &HT;    Muchos narcotraficantes, afirma Tracy Reinhold, agente de la
Oficina Federal de Investigaciones (FBI), han comenzado a operar en
el sector del transporte de carga porque pueden ganar mucho dinero
con mucho menos riesgos: las penalidades por traficar un contenedor
de microprocesadores son mucho menores que si fuera cocaina.
 &HT;    Si antes el gran problema era el robo en menor cuantia en los
camiones, ahora los delincuentes se infiltran en las empresas de
transporte, crean facturas y documentos falsos y se dedican a
vaciar y rellenar contenedores en los almacenes.
 &HT;    ``Es un negocio muy liquido,'' explica Reinhold. ``Se roban las
cosas hoy y las venden en 72 horas. Es un problema constante para
los puertos grandes, como Nueva York, Miami y Memphis.''
 &HT;    El aumento de la vigilancia en el puerto de Miami, la mayor
terminal portuaria de Estados Unidos que maneja carga desde y hacia
Latinoamerica, se produce en medio de un ataque nacional contra
este flagelo. Hace casi un ano, el FBI inicio la operacion Sudden
Stop, que genero 400 arrestos y encausamientos. ``A principios de
los anos 90 comenzamos a dedicar mas esfuerzos a los delitos
relacionados con las pandillas y menos a los delitos contra la
propiedad,'' afirma el agente Reinhold. ``Ahora vamos en sentido
contrario.''
 &HT;    En 1999 las autoridades acusaron a ocho personas de robar
componentes de computadoras que sus clientes les pedian desde
America Latina.
 &HT;    A pesar del progreso logrado, en el puerto de Miami todavia se
roba mucha mercancia, lo que no debe sorprender.. La mayoria de los
robos ocurren durante el traslado de la carga de un medio de

PLAYING OOMPAH IN THE KEY OF WHATEVER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A memorial service for a famously self-destructive
performance artist is about to start, and out on the sidewalk on
the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the sousaphone player for the
Hungry March Band is teaching the tenor saxophonist a new song. No
sheet music is required.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to repeat five notes,'' Scott Moore, the man with
the big horn, tells Emily Fairey. ``The first three notes everybody
drew out of a bag, different notes for everyone. The fourth note is
a collective B flat. The fifth note is your choice. It's sort of a
tribute to his idea of random chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Fairey nods like a veteran pitcher. ``Got it.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, the band files out of the community center,
trailing mourners. The new song, powerful as it is simple, seems to
hold the sunlit air still _ three slow chords, noirish and
Mingus-y, rising to the clear, piercing B flat, improbably heroic,
then dissolving into the final random chord, dense and mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   The band strikes up an improvised funeral march, greasy and
soulful, something out of New Orleans by way of Eastern Europe, and
steps off in no particular formation. Up Eldridge and onto Houston,
children cling to fences to watch the motley band go by, young
couples stare down bemused from tenement windows, and hipsters
slurping iced cappuccinos sway in front of cafes. Everyone smiles.
Everyone loves a parade.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-20th century, outdoor bands, whether marching or
stationary, played a vital role in American civic life, adding
celebratory notes to every public ritual from a judge's
installation to a saloon opening. Bands still roam the streets in
places like India and Peru, but outside of Louisiana, professional
marching bands have all but vanished from the American landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a passe thing,'' said Joe Losh, an 81-year-old trumpeter
who leads the John Philip Sousa American Legion Post Band in
Manhattan and who recalled running from one parade to the next on
the day Franklin D. Roosevelt announced the National Recovery Act.
``The old guys don't want to march anymore. The young guys are into
rock 'n' roll; they don't want to march. All you got left is the
high school bands, and once they graduate they give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Siegel, a band leader active in Local 802 of the American
Federation of Musicians who is sometimes asked to put together
marching bands for parades, could not name a single year-round,
semi-stable professional marching band in the city. There was, he
and Losh said, simply not enough work anymore to keep a marching
band busy.
</P>
<P>
   The Hungry March Band, a quasi-anarchist collective of 10 to 25
musicians, dancers and twirlers of widely varying abilities from
the arty streets of the Williamsburg neighborhood in Brooklyn, beg
to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always someone who needs a marching band,'' said
Theresa Westerdahl, 28, one the band's four drummers and its de
facto manager.
</P>
<P>
   In the three dozen or so shows _ about 15 of them paid _ that
the band has played in the last year, it has led a pet store's
parade of dogs, marched naked across a long white table at a
dot-com mogul's millennium party in TriBeCa, serenaded marathon
runners and commandeered subway trains at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The band marches mostly in its own community and in the
radical-friendly East Village and Lower East Side. But it has also
done the twist in Times Square to protest the city's restrictive
cabaret laws, blessed a church's Thanksgiving feast in Queens, and
rallied anti-World Trade Organization troops in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The band will play for just about anyone. Last fall, the day
after providing sonic support at a Manhattan demonstration against
the homogenizing forces of Starbucks and Disney (purse: $200), the
band played the opening of a mini-mall in Williamsburg ($400). The
mall is no Wal-Mart _ its boutiquey shops are all owned by locals _
but band members were amused to hear themselves accused of selling
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the political stuff the band does tends to be a
little shrill, so it was kind of nice to be able to do the opposite
and not be so partisan,'' said Jon Lewis, 36, an artist who plays
the marching mellophone, a sort of trumpet-shaped French horn.
</P>
<P>
   The band's music is a strange blend. Into it go the mixed
musical resumes of its members _ lapsed school band nerds, a jazz
trumpeter who has played at the Blue Note, a drummer for a
hard-core punk band, veterans of New York's experimental-noise
scene, and a few near-beginners. Out flows a ragged but usually
coherent sound, full of passion and surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all these kinds of personalities rubbing up against each
other, and this is what happens,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   The dress code is similarly loose. A few members wear actual
marching-band uniforms scavenged from thrift shops, but they are
just as likely to parade in purple robes or white skullcaps or
feathers. The band's only nod to militarism is its ever-present
flag, depicting an ear above a crossed knife and fork.
</P>
<P>
   Jenneth Webster, the producer of Lincoln Center Out of Doors,
who has booked the band for opening day on Aug. 5, compared Hungry
March to the Arkestra, the band led by the late cosmic jazz genius
Sun Ra, who claimed to have descended to Earth from Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that every musical ensemble is unique, but they're
really unique,'' Webster said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the band's shows evolve into audience participation
events. At a march against trash transfer stations in Williamsburg,
an old man abandoned his walker and pounded on a piece of sheet
metal that was being carried in front of the band. At a winter
celebration in the East Village in January, someone in the crowd
handed out sleigh bells.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``People love the marching band,'' said Sasha Sumner, a soprano
saxophone player. ``No matter what we're doing you have a big group
of people who want to join in just from hearing it for a second.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the results can be disorienting. But the music seems
able to accommodate a lot of chaos.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so public that you can't really tell people they can't
play,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   The band, originally a four-piece, formed in 1997 to play the
Coney Island Mermaid Parade, one of the city's freakiest annual
public spectacles. (The name, bestowed by a departing founding
member, refers both to the band's will-play-for-food business
strategy and to a deeper hunger for something raw and real.)
</P>
<P>
   Then in the spring of last year, an opportunity arose for the
band to play at a sex-industry convention at the Javits Center.
Westerdahl, a massage therapist by day, put up recruitment posters
around the neighborhood to fill out the sound.
</P>
<P>
   The selection process was simple. ``Whoever kept coming got to
stay in the band,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Javits Center gig fell through, but the band took off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would do clandestine marches in the neighborhood,'' said
Moore, a 40-year-old carpenter with a linebacker's build and an
Amishman's beard, ``just to take it to the South Side,'' the still
largely Hispanic section of Williamsburg. ``To see the smiles on
people's faces, the little tykes, the tough guys on the corner
digging it, too, really made me take notice of what a generous
thing this was, and that's when practices got regular.''
</P>
<P>
   Practices are happenings in themselves. Sunday afternoons,
members gather on an enormous concrete slab overlooking the East
River in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, set in a marsh
dotted with Stonehenge-size chunks of bulldozed industrial
buildings. (If it rains, they adjourn to a spot under the
Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.)
</P>
<P>
   A few Sundays ago, two teen-age boys hacked their way through
the weeds and watched two women in midriff-baring T-shirts juggle
flaming torches while a tumbler practiced splits on the
glass-strewn concrete. A stranger wandered past playing bagpipes,
and Sumner and one of the trombonists tootled over to check him
out.
</P>
<P>
   A Hasidic family walking down by the pier made a detour up onto
the concrete, drawn in by the snaky, vaguely klezmer-like strains
of a waltz, ``Whack Clown,'' which Lewis wrote for the memorial of
the performance artist Mark Ashwill.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the band improvised everything, but it found that
structures somehow emerged and congealed. Soon members were writing
tunes on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with the presence of songs,'' Moore said, as if
discussing an infestation.
</P>
<P>
   The band even plays a couple of non-original numbers, though
neither is a staple of the American band repertoire _ a World War
II Italian Partisan anthem, ``Ciao Bella,'' and an Indian movie
soundtrack hit called ``Disco Bhangra.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every performance is stellar. At a recent Sunday march
through the East Village, starting at 10 a.m., the band, including,
for the first time, Fairey's 3-year-old son, Sammy, on toy trumpet,
sounded peevish, a brown stew of blats and thumps. The bass
drummer, Doug Anson, walked close to cars and banged loudly,
setting off their alarms.

<P>
   ``It's a little early in the morning for us,'' Sumner conceded
afterward.

<P>
   The band has faced other problems. One time, Moore's spats got
hooked together and he fell horn first into Avenue A. As he lay
helplessly tangled, all his change spilled out of his pockets and
children descended on him and stole it.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, at a Halloween parade in the East Village, he got
tangled in his spats again and fell onto Jeremy Obviren, the snare
drummer. Fortunately, Obviren was wearing a foam praying mantis on
his head.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, though, things turn out as they did on the
day of the memorial service for Ashwill last month. When the band
reached Tompkins Square Park, three kindergarten-size girls emerged
from the crowd and started dancing and jumping in time to the
music.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Ashwill's former dance partner, DD Dorvillier, walked
up and thanked the band tearfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I heard them I thought they were really fruity,
really crazy,'' she said later. ``But today, as soon as I heard
those chords in the brass I started to cry. That piece was like
digging your heels in the dirt to take a big shovelful of dirt and
throw it over your shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed them to play.''

IBM SUPERCOMPUTER WILL PUT MORE BANG IN NUCLEAR TESTING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LETITIA STEIN 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A supercomputer three times faster than any to date
and with a footprint the size of two basketball courts is on its
way to the Department of Energy to make possible nuclear testing
without so much as a bang.
</P>
<P>
   The ASCI White supercomputer, unveiled by IBM Wednesday, is
capable of processing 12.3 trillion calculations per second. It
would take someone 10 million years to do that number using an
ordinary calculator.
</P>
<P>
   And chess players beware: ASCI White is 1,000 times more
powerful than ``Deep Blue,'' the computer that beat World Chess
Champion Gary Kasparov in a highly publicized 1997 match between
man and machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a significant development in pushing forward the
technology, and we view this as just a step,'' said Jim Jardine,
IBM program manager.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight trucks are transporting the ASCI White system _
which weighs as much as 17 adult elephants _ to the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratories in California, where it will be
used simulate the explosions of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ASCI White was developed through the Department of Energy's
Stockpile Stewardship Program. The $110 million supercomputer is
part of a series of ever-faster computers the program needs to
monitor the aging of nuclear weapons without underground testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see whether or not it actually goes boom'' using computer
simulations, said David Cooper, chief information officer at the
Livermore lab.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a computer as powerful as ASCI White over 20 days
to perform the calculations necessary to simulate the detonation of
a nuclear weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The department hopes to have the technology to simulate the
entire aging process of stockpiled nuclear weapons by 2004, when a
computer eight times as powerful as ASCI White is slated for
completion.
</P>
<P>
   While ASCI White will be limited to classified usage, its
unprecedented computing power is expected to lead to advances in
other fields _ such as weather forecasting, biological engineering
and drug design _ as IBM makes the technology available for
commercial use.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the computer community must learn how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Computer science professor Ken Kennedy, director of the Center
for High Performance Software Research at Rice University in
Houston, cautioned that ASCI White's mega-fast processing
capabilities are only as powerful as the software it runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real achievement here is making a machine that is actually
balanced in a way that can run applications efficiently,'' he said,
referring to the common problem of not having the software needed
to take advantage of a supercomputer's power.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he expressed optimism that the technology will one day
let scientists simulate physics at its highest complexity, from
studying water tension on the surface of an aircraft to the folding
of protein structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to mean better science, better engineering and, in
the end, a better life,'' Kennedy said.

ANALYSIS: REACTIONS TO ABORTION RULING REFLECT POLITICAL
STRATEGIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SCOTUS-ABORTION) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The strikingly different reactions to the Supreme
Court's ruling on abortion Wednesday underscore how Vice President
Al Gore is trying mightily to catapult the court into a
front-and-center issue in the presidential campaign, while Gov.
George W. Bush wants the matter to fade from the political horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the court announced its 5-4 decision striking down
Nebraska's late-term abortion ban, Gore upended a planned talk in
Blacklick, Ohio, about the environment and energy, and instead
opened his remarks by warning that the unexpected closeness of the
vote demonstrated the importance of electing a president who would
pick justices who would protect abortion rights. He said nothing
about the late-term abortion procedure addressed by the court.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bush made no mention of the broader makeup of the
court, though he did upbraid the justices for not upholding the
right to ban what he called ``the brutal practice'' of late-term
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasting strategies _ and remarks from the two rivals _
reflect differing political imperatives. The Bush strategy is to
make the abortion issue go away, and, for his campaign, the timing
of Wednesday's ruling is not propitious. The last thing the
Republicans want one month before their nominating convention is
another spectacle that turns rancorous over abortion. Not only
that, the ruling comes as Bush is mulling over whether he dares
pick a running mate who favors abortion rights and how he can
finesse the issue in the party platform.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore wants to do whatever he can to keep the matter alive _
and paint Republicans as riven by internecine squabbles over
abortion. Gore officials have been waiting gleefully for months in
anticipation of Wednesday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst news that the Bush campaign could get,''
said Ann Stone, national chairwoman of the Republicans For Choice
PAC. The closeness of the court ruling, she said, gave Gore a fresh
hook to declare that abortion rights may be endangered, and to
shore up his sagging support from women.
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Bond, the former Republican Party chairman who for
years has counseled the party to not let itself split over
abortion, said the best thing Bush could do was to keep a low
profile on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll try to paint Bush as risky, extremist, out of touch,
intolerant,'' Bond said of Democrats. ``I don't think Bush is going
to take the bait on this. What can a presidential candidate do
about a Supreme Court decision?''
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, Gore put out fresh bait. He seized on the ruling _
and another that gives states greater leeway to restrict
anti-abortion demonstrations outside health clinics _ and tried to
reignite the abortion issue in the Republican Party. For months, in
speech after speech, Gore has warned that religious conservatives
like Patrick Buchanan and Jerry Falwell would ratify prospects for
the bench if Bush is elected.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Wednesday: ``The next president will nominate at least
three and probably four, perhaps four, justices to the Supreme
Court. One extra vote on the wrong side of those two issues would
change the outcome and a woman's right to choose would be taken
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Gore recalled that Bush has said he respects
Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, both of whom were
dissenters in the decision Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Air Force II on Wednesday night on a flight from Columbus,
Ohio, to New York, Gore stepped up his attack, asserting that Bush
was determined to overturn Roe vs. Wade, which affirms a woman's
right to an abortion. ``His views about choice are really quite
extreme,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was also on script, asserting at a news
conference here that the court's stand on abortion was ``very much
in the balance, depending on what appointments are made in the next
four years.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise that Bush, in his remarks, failed to mention
the prospect of vacancies on the Supreme Court. While conservative
groups have trumpeted the balance of the court as a high-stakes
voting issue, Bush almost never raises it on the stump. He does not
want to put off moderate and swing voters who may support abortion
rights. He also knows, perhaps, that usually only the most partisan
voters think about the makeup of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush told supporters in Cleveland, ``I hope to be able
to come up with a law that meets the constitutional scrutiny. And,
unlike Al Gore, I pledge to fight for a ban on partial birth
abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling is discouraging for Bush and many Republicans
not only because it gives Gore another rationale to talk about the
court. In addition, the Republicans' embrace in the last few years
of eliminating late-term abortion allowed the party to maintain its
anti-abortion position in a way that is more palatable to many
voters than suggesting overturning the constitutional amendment
allowing abortion. Even many Democrats who favor abortion rights
tell pollsters they object to late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   But with Wednesday's decision, it may be difficult for
politicians like Rep. Rick Lazio, a Republican who is running for
the U.S. Senate from New York, to declare that he favors abortion
rights but voted to prohibit some late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will no longer be credible for politicians to claim to be
pro-choice while supporting these abortion bans,'' said Janet
Benshoof, president of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy,
which represented the doctor in the Nebraska case.
</P>
<P>
   Another complication is that some Republicans have already begun
debating whether they should keep language in the party platform
that applauds efforts ``to sign into law an end to partial birth
abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to energizing Democrats, Wednesday's ruling may
embolden conservatives, some of whom want Bush, like Gore, to turn
it into a rallying cry to discuss the court itself. But in their
determination that Bush capture the White House, they are reluctant
to press him to be outspoken on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like him to aggressively criticize the decision and to
say how important it is that we have judges who respect innocent
human life,'' said Phyllis Schlafly, the prominent anti-abortion
advocate. Asked if Bush should raise the abortion issue more, she
said, ``I don't know that he has to make it the first thing he
talks about at every stop. There's so much to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Graves of Kansas put it this way: ``Many Republicans
are prepared to put aside differences on abortion and other issues
in exchange for the greater good _ the election of George Bush as
president.''

GANNETT BUYS CENTRAL NEWSPAPERS FOR $2.6 BILLION IN CASH 
</HEADLINE>
   By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Gannett Co., whose stable of newspapers is already the
largest in the country, announced Wednesday that it has agreed to
acquire Central Newspapers Inc., the owner of The Arizona Republic
and The Indianapolis Star, for $2.6 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   That price tag makes the deal the second largest in newspaper
history, after the recent purchase of the Times Mirror Co., which
publishes The Los Angeles Times, by the Tribune Co., which owns The
Chicago Tribune, for $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition marks the end of the long reign of the Pulliam
family, the descendants of Central's founder Eugene Pulliam, a
conservative publishing clan whose members include Dan Quayle, the
former Republican vice president. The family has long been a
political force in Indiana and Arizona _ one investment banker
pointed out that neither state observes Daylight Savings Time
``because Eugene Pulliam always refused to change his clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Weil III, chairman and chief executive of Central, said
last night that the sale to Gannett is an acknowledgment that
Central simply lacked the scale necessary to be successful in
today's market of large media properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were too big to be small and too small to be big, as a
public company,'' Weil said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas McCorkindale, president and chief executive of Gannett,
said in a statement that the company expects to operate Central's
newspaper properties ``in keeping with the high standards
established by the Pulliam family.''
</P>
<P>
   To effect the deal, Gannett is offering to buy all of Central's
publicly traded Class A stock for $64 a share. The stock, which has
risen 118 percent since the company put itself up for sale three
weeks ago, closed Wednesday at $64.25, up 12.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett, which is based in Arlington, Va., is also offering to
purchase Central's Class B shares for $6.40 a share. A Pulliam
family trust, which owns just under 83 percent of those shares and
thus controls approximately 78 percent of Central's shareholder
votes, has granted Gannett an option to purchase its shares. The
remaining 17.2 percent of the Class B shares are owned directly by
members of the Pulliam family.
</P>
<P>
   Under Indiana law, which governs in this case, a shareholder
meeting will not be necessary if at least 90 percent of each class
of stock is tendered to Gannett, explained Eric Tooker, Central's
general counsel. If a shareholder meeting is necessary, the Pulliam
trust's shares alone are sufficient to ensure that the merger will
be approved.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett already publishes 89 daily newspapers worldwide,
including USA Today, the nation's largest-selling weekday
newspaper. It announced on June 8 that it plans to acquire 21
additional daily papers in Louisiana, Maryland, Ohio, Wisconsin and
Utah from the Thomson Corp. for $1.125 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett also operates 22 television stations, including KPNX-TV
in Phoenix, where both Central's home office and one of its key
properties, The Arizona Republic, are based. According to Gannett,
the transaction does not involve the transfer of any broadcast
licenses, and therefore does not require the approval of the
Federal Communications Commission. However, if the federal
cross-ownership rules, which govern the ownership of multiple media
outlets in a single market, have not been modified before KPNX's
license is up for renewal in October 2006, Gannett would need a
waiver from the F.C.C. to continue owning both the television
station and the Phoenix newspaper, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett's share price has slipped in recent days amid
speculation that it would be bidding for the Central properties,
which had become increasingly expensive as Central's stock
strengthened. Market analysts speculated that investors feared
Gannett would pay too much for the Central properties.
</P>
<P>
   The price Wednesday is roughly 11.8 times Central's expected
earnings in the current year, before interest, taxes and
depreciation, only slightly higher than the value given to the
Times Mirror's earnings in the Tribune Co. deal. If Gannett is able
to trim costs _ by eliminating Central's corporate overhead, for
example _ the price would represent an even better value, one
analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is an excellent one for Central's shareholders, said
Thomas Russo, a partner in Gardner Russo Gardner, which is listed
as Central's second largest institutional shareholder. ``But my
dream outcome would have been to get Gannett stock at this price,''
said Russo, who said he thinks the purchase ``doesn't change the
bright prospects for Gannett.''
</P>
<P>
   Central was advised in the deal by Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette,
with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. advising the Pulliam family trust.
Gannett did not employ an investment banking firm for the deal.

FORD AND TOYOTA TEST THE SALE OF CARS ONLINE IN CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Canada has become a laboratory for the automobile
industry's experiment with selling cars to consumers over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian subsidiaries of Ford Motor and Toyota Motor have
established test Web sites to let consumers in three regions of the
country log onto the Internet to buy vehicles _ tests that could
foreshadow the companies' global strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Though all automakers maintain Web pages for product and other
information, car buyers in Canada can use the Toyota site to
compare brands, pick the model and options they want, get a price
for their trade-in vehicle, arrange financing and place an order
through a participating dealer.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians who have tried the test Web sites seem to like
them, at least partly because there is no bargaining with a
showroom salesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a haggler, and I don't like to feel that I'm being
taken advantage of,'' said Kathryn Tessier, a 38-year-old
chiropractor in Brandon, Manitoba, who bought a new Toyota Solara
coupe in March through the Web site. ``This way, there's a
bottom-line price _ it's the same deal for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   An appealing feature, Tessier said, was the ability to see how
different options affected the price. That led her to buy a coupe
instead of her original choice, a convertible. She was also able to
compare financing plans easily. She then took a test drive at a
local dealer, Precision Toyota in Brandon. ``I had to see the
car,'' she said. ``I just couldn't order it over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Although car manufacturers are venturing into Internet sales
slowly, the idea is nothing new. E-commerce car-dealer specialists
like CarsDirect.com and carOrder.com have expanded quickly in the
United States, and cars4u.com is about to begin operations in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Online sales of new and used cars in the United States amounted
to $19 billion last year, about 3 percent of the total market,
according to Gomez Advisors, a research firm in Lincoln, Mass. But
it says that by 2002, Internet auto purchases will exceed $140
billion annually, almost a 20 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   Such a potentially huge increase in sales is an important reason
why the automakers are at least testing the business of selling on
the Internet, in cooperation with conventional dealers who feel
threatened by their online competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Car companies control the market through dealers, and as
Internet players gain more control of the purchasing process, it
will be tougher for dealers to maintain their profits and their
relationships with buyers,'' said Dennis DesRosiers, a
Toronto-based automotive consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Internet car dealers do not see it that way. Barry Shafran,
president of cars4u.com, said the automakers' programs would appeal
to ``consumers who are not educated _ it's still the dealers who
are setting prices.'' Internet car retailers, he pointed out, need
to own dealerships themselves to buy new vehicles from automakers.
And orders placed through manufacturers' Web sites are routed
through a dealer, usually one selected by the buyer. Someone from
the dealership also has to make one house call to get a signature
on an order form and perhaps another to deliver the car.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Motor Co. of Canada Ltd. recently began a larger test
program than Toyota's, with 24 participating dealers. It is selling
only three brands online _ Focus, Taurus and Windstar _ in two
regions of Ontario: the populous Niagara Peninsula in the south and
around the federal capital of Ottawa in the east. Toyota is selling
in one region, the area around Winnipeg, Manitoba, with eight
dealers participating.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ford contends that its BuyerConnection program is the
only ``direct-order-to-the-manufacturer automotive Web site
available today,'' it, too, is set up for sales through dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that Canadians spend as much time on the Internet
as Americans do but that they are more timid online shoppers and
that 80 percent of those who buy cars hate dickering over price.
The Ford and Toyota Internet projects eliminate price negotiations.
Participating dealers provide what are described as discounted, or
competitive, market prices.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the manufacturers expect many more shopping visits
than buying visits to their Web pages. ``But by the time they
arrive in the dealer's showroom they are going to be pretty well
armed with information about the vehicle they are going to buy,''
said Stephen Beattie, a spokesman for Toyota in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're modernizing the way we do business,'' he said. ``We're
not trying to move to direct sales. But consumers want more
information up front, and this is a tool for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford says its program is an ``integration of the bricks and
clicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Total activity on Toyota's Web site increased 40 percent in the
first month of the Internet sales test, Beattie said. It will
probably become available across Canada in the fall. In the United
States, Toyota Motor Sales has begun a similar test project in the
Seattle-Tacoma area, with 19 dealer participants.

 &HT;    Davidian survivor talks about escape from fiery Mount Carmel
 &HT;    By Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ As flames destroyed Mount Carmel, Branch Davidian
Clive Doyle testified that he dove through a hole created by
government tanks to escape the heat that seared his hands and said
he wondered if anyone else made it out of the inferno alive.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, a plaintiff in the $675 million wrongful death lawsuit
against the government, spent about five hours on the witness stand
Wednesday describing life inside David Koresh's compound during the
51-day siege with the government and the chaotic, fiery end on
April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle told the five-member advisory jury that ``the skin was
rolling off my hands'' as he jumped from the building through a
hole in the wall of the chapel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked back over my shoulder and saw a massive wall of
flames and I thought I was the only one who got out,'' Doyle said,
his voice cracking with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Eight others escaped the fire, but Doyle once again choked back
tears as his attorney, former U.S. attorney general Ramsey Clark,
asked about his 18-year-old daughter, Shari, who did not.
</P>
<P>
   Government attorney James Touhey, however, implied during
cross-examination that Doyle cared more about himself and his small
dog than he did about his daughter or anyone else in the structure.
He also accused Doyle of helping start the fire by pouring
flammable liquid on some stairs, charging that is why his hands
were so badly burned and why there were traces of a fire accelerant
on the sleeves of the blue nylon jacket he was wearing that day.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle denied pouring the liquid or starting the fire in which
Koresh and 75 followers died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, isn't it a fact that you poured that liquid on the
stairs?'' Touhey said.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your hands. How did your hands get burned in the fire?''
Touhey asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you should try it sometime,'' Doyle said dryly.
</P>
<P>
   Clark asked Doyle if he saw Misty Ferguson's hands during her
trial testimony Tuesday. Ferguson, who also escaped the fire, lost
fingers on both hands because of her burns.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle told the jury that he spent most of the 51-day siege in
the chapel area of the compound. His daughter and three others
stayed there with him until Koresh gave an edict that the women and
children were to remain in their rooms upstairs, Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   He said living conditions inside what Clark referred to as the
``church center'' became increasingly difficult as the standoff
with government agents dragged on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty rough,'' he said. ``We were not able to get to
the toilet facilities, which were outside at the time. At one
point, the electricity was cut off.''
</P>
<P>
   That caused much of the food supply in the freezers to ruin,
Doyle said, adding that water supplies also got low, causing
Davidians to ration water and resort to catching rainwater in pots
to replenish the supply.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, who said he lost 30 pounds during the standoff and slept
very little, testified that he dug a grave in an underground
shelter in which they buried four of the five sect members who were
killed on the morning of the Feb. 28, 1993, raid on Mount Carmel by
agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Four ATF agents were killed during the gun battle that ensued
when agents attempted to arrest Koresh on weapons violations.
</P>
<P>
   Davidians felt a sense of ``elation'' and thought ``this was all
going to be resolved peacefully'' after FBI negotiators got an
agreement from Koresh that he and his followers would surrender
after Koresh finished writing his interpretations of the Seven
Seals from the Book of Revelation, Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   That, by Doyle's estimation at the time of Koresh's pledge,
would have taken another two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On the day before the raid, Doyle said he felt so bad that he
slept on the bed in his room for the first time during the siege.
About 4 a.m. on April 19th, Doyle said went to the chapel to read
his Bible because he couldn't sleep. A couple of hours later, he
said, he heard a loud speaker blaring that the siege was over and
that the FBI would be pumping gas into the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle said he retrieved a gas mask that had been by his sleeping
bag on the floor of the chapel and put it on. Each time a tank
equipped with a boom crashed into the building and sprayed the
misty tear gas that Doyle said had the consistency of talcum
powder, the Davidians would rush into another area, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he assumed that the women and children were upstairs.
Most of them didn't have gas masks, Doyle said, adding that
Jennifer Andrade rushed downstairs during the tear-gas assault and
asked if more gas masks were available.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle said men were crying because of the tear gas, which he
said felt like ``battery acid'' on the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning, Doyle said he heard someone yell that the
compound was on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking out a hole in the chapel and smoke came down the
south wall and got sucked into the hole and everything turned
black,'' Doyle said. ``Within a few seconds, I felt heat over the
top of my head and it was very oppressive. There was no conscious
thought to get down on the floor. The heat just pushed you down and
I was on the floor rolling around and it felt like I was burning.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle said he was holding a small dog that he cared for during
the standoff and pitched it out through the hole and onto the
ground. The dog found its way back inside and Doyle said he threw
it out two more times before he jumped out himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dog was there with you,'' Touhey said on
cross-examination. ``You threw him out three times. You didn't go
look for your daughter, though, did you?''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle said no, explaining that he had been sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you were well enough to go get water for yourself and put
on extra clothes,'' Touhey countered.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle told Clark that the Davidians had no plan to commit
suicide, saying that church doctrine made them ``dead-set against''
killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no plan to commit suicide,'' Doyle said. ``We had an
agreement to come out as soon as certain things took place. We had
an agreement. We were hanging on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Touhey asked Doyle to explain how the flammable liquid got on
the sleeves of his coat. Doyle said he didn't know, but theorized
that he could have spilled lantern fluid when he was refilling
lamps or said the dog might have tracked it back inside after
walking through gasoline and diesel from gas tanks and barrels
knocked over by the tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, who was acquitted of all criminal charges after a 1994
trial in San Antonio, defended the sect's beliefs, including that
God spoke through Koresh. He said that Koresh's sexual
relationships with teen-age girls in the group were ``spiritual
relationships'' that the girls entered into freely.
</P>
<P>
   Touhey asked Doyle about reports that his daughter had become
one of Koresh's ``wives.'' Doyle said he never talked to her or
Koresh about it.
</P>
<P>
   After Touhey's rigorous cross-examination, lead plaintiffs
attorney Mike Caddell asked Doyle if there ever is a day that goes
by that he doesn't think about his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle became emotional again, paused and said, ``I live with
this every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the lunch break Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Walter S.
Smith Jr. again became impatient with the pace of the trial, saying
at one point, ``You are taking way too much time, Mr. Clark.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clark asked Doyle about recent efforts to rebuild a chapel at
Mount Carmel, Touhey objected. The judge asked Clark to explain the
relevance of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that faith goes on, your honor,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's relevant about that?'' the judge asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows you can't crush religion,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what this trial is about. Sustain the objection,''
Smith said.

   KAMPALA, Uganda _ Once there were few places in Africa as grim
as Uganda, now there are few as hopeful. The man who claims the
credit is campaigning hard for voters to reward him in perhaps an
odd way: He wants them to admit that Uganda is still backward and
not yet ready to open up to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   President Yoweri Museveni is balder and bulkier than when he was
a bush fighter, his once-brilliant reputation dulled recently at
home and abroad. But he is still the man who brought Uganda back
and did so with a certain steady charm _ on full display the other
day when a group of college students heckled him for more than 20
minutes as he tried to give a speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give us a chance to talk,'' he said. He leaned back and
scratched his nose patiently, waiting for quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not how democracy works,'' he lectured the hecklers
here at Makerere University. ``Democracy works by hearing and then
deciding in a calm way.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past few months Museveni, 56, has been lecturing not
only students but also all Ugandans on his version of democracy.
And on Thursday voters will decide between two political systems:
whether to continue with the ``Movement,'' which Museveni
champions, or switch to a multiparty system, outlawed since
Museveni fought his way to power in 1986 after two violent decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Movement is what Museveni calls a no-party state. It is an
umbrella group with the goal of uniting all Ugandans (its symbol is
a big yellow bus) and to which all Ugandans theoretically belong.
His argument is that political parties divide Ugandans by tribe and
religion -_and that those splits gave rise to leaders like Idi Amin
and Milton Obote, whose reigns ended the lives of tens of thousands
of Ugandans. Now, even after 14 years under his rule, Museveni says
Uganda has still not matured enough politically or economically for
the return of political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried having a lot of parties but we failed,'' he said in
Luganda, the language of Uganda's largest tribe, the Baganda, at a
recent campaign rally just outside Kampala. ``We messed up with bad
leadership. It's up to you people to decide whether you want to
move with the Movement or move with the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But a growing column of opponents say the Movement is becoming a
one-party state in disguise. Some go so far as to call Museveni its
new-style dictator. Under law, political parties can exist in name,
but they cannot hold rallies or conventions or field candidates for
office. Real democracy, opponents say, requires more than one
political party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an excuse, a pretext,'' said Paul Ssemogerere, leader of
the Democratic Party and a former presidential candidate against
Museveni. ``You have ethnic divides in America. When Dukakis ran
for president, the Greek community was enthusiastic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have WASPs, the Jewish vote, the Latino vote, the black
vote,'' he added. ``But is that an argument against democracy? If
anything, it is a point for democracy that you are able to give
voice to all communities. That is the beauty of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt how this referendum will turn out.
Ssemogerere and other leading opposition figures have called for a
boycott, and their rallies are filled with people who say they will
not vote. So it seems certain that the Movement _ headed by a
still-popular Museveni _ will win.
</P>
<P>
   But with elections for president and Parliament coming next
year, the real questions will be Museveni's margin of victory and
the percentage of Uganda's 9.6 million registered voters (the total
population is about 23 million) who come out to vote. The results
will give both Museveni and his opponents vital clues for the
national mood as they focus on the contests next year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the referendum comes at a telling time for Uganda and in
some ways Africa itself. To the nation's credit, foreign diplomats
and other observers say, the peaceful campaign in Uganda contrasts
sharply with Zimbabwe, led by a long-serving former guerrilla
fighter.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time of so much pessimism about conflict and corruption
around Africa, Museveni has been campaigning as his image abroad _
and with many of his own constituents _ has hit a low because of
his nation's participation in the war in Congo. Museveni has for
years been considered one of Africa's most progressive leaders. He
liberalized the economy, invested in the infrastructure and in
education and stressed African self reliance. He stood first among
a ``new breed'' of African leaders praised several years ago by
President Clinton (all of whom subsequently dragged their nations
into war).
</P>
<P>
   But in August 1998, he and his neighbor to the south, Rwanda,
supported rebels seeking to overthrow Congo's president, Laurent
Kabila. Even if Uganda can convince the world that its reasons are
good _ rebels who attack Uganda are based in Congo _ it has been
harder to justify its behavior. Soldiers are accused of rank
profiteering, dealing in diamonds, timber and gold.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, troops from Uganda and Rwanda have themselves clashed
three times in the Congolese city of Kisangani _ most recently this
month when both sides rained down shells indiscriminately, killing
what aid groups said was at least 600 people, mostly civilians.
Even the United States, often accused of being too lenient with
Uganda, strongly condemned Museveni.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congo has to some extent caused his performance to be
re-evaluated,'' said one Western diplomat here, who asked to be
anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Though the result of the referendum does not seem in doubt,
Museveni has been campaigning ferociously. He has visited nearly
all of Uganda's 45 districts and recently has spent hours on radio
programs answering call-in questions.
</P>
<P>
   While the referendum is supposed to be between two systems,
Museveni has made it very much about himself and his performance.
He reels off the accomplishments not of a political system but of
his government: providing more electricity, making primary
education essentially free, opening the economy to foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
   He jokes that life has improved so much that poor farmers use
mobile phones while hoeing their fields. He says that the work is
far from done, and that continuing the Movement is the only way to
keep improving.
</P>
<P>
   But his opponents say that the glass of Uganda is really half
empty. Poverty and unemployment remain high. The Congo war is
unpopular. Museveni, they say, gets more autocratic each year (he
may run for only one more five-year term). He seems tolerant, they
say, but that disguises a harder side. Several protesters at
Makerere were arrested and beaten up.
</P>
<P>
   From students in Makerere to clerks in small towns, Ugandans
themselves do not seem excited about the referendum, now that the
nation has become accustomed to voting. Turnout to civic education
classes has been low. Many Ugandans do not see their choice as
clear as either Museveni or his opponents portray it.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally for the Democratic Party, Edith Namutebi, 22, said
she liked Museveni but not the Movement, which she said is not open
enough. So she will not be voting. A few feet away, Mbuya Faisal,
26, said he was not voting, but gave an opposite reason: He agrees
with Museveni that multi-parties will divide the nation by tribe.
After 14 years, he is merely tired of Museveni and thinks he should
not make the mistake of so many African leaders _ staying in power
too long.
</P>
<P>
   For many young people like them, the evils of Uganda's past are
only a hazy memory, and as time goes on, it will become harder to
sway voters based on that. Just shy of half all Ugandans are under
the age of 15, nearly all born since Museveni became president. l

CHURCH SCHOOLS WIN ROUND BEFORE SUPREME COURT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed the federal
government to continue providing computers to religious as well as
public schools, saying the national program does not violate the
constitutionally mandated separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   The court, in a 6-3 decision, said the Education Department's
effort to ensure that all students have computers is a neutral
program under which the federal government neither endorses nor
repudiates the sectarian messages taught at parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling clears the way for the federal program to
continue unimpeded in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. The 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers the three states, had
ruled in 1998 that the program violates the First Amendment clause
prohibiting the government from endorsing religion.
</P>
<P>
   Americans United for Separation of Church and State said the
court ``took a sledgehammer'' to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based group said the ruling means that taxpayers
will continue to support federal assistance to religious
institutions, a governmental use of revenue that the First
Amendment was designed to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in Supreme Court history that the
justices have allowed a resource to be given to parochial schools
that can readily be diverted to religious purposes,'' said Barry
Lynn, the group's executive director. ``At public expense,
religious schools can now have students surf the Internet to read
the bible in religion classes ... or download crucifixes as screen
savers.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Family Research Council praised the court's decision,
saying that fairness dictates that all students, even those in
religious schools, be provided with computers and other secular
materials that aid in their education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government does not have to discriminate against religion
in order to satisfy'' the Constitution, said Jan LaRue, senior
director for legal studies at the Washington-based council.
``Taxpayer dollars should be distributed equally among all
schoolchildren, regardless of what their religious beliefs are.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they upheld the program, the six justices in the majority
could not agree on exactly how much assistance government officials
can provide to parochial schools without violating the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the justices said officials should have wide latitude to
provide learning devices to all educational institutions on an
equal, ``neutral'' basis. Justice Clarence Thomas expressed this
view, in an opinion joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
and Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   But the two other justices in the majority, Sandra Day O'Connor
and Stephen G. Breyer, said their colleagues'
governmental-neutrality test for upholding parochial-school
assistance programs was too broad, potentially enabling the
government to assist sectarian study unconstitutionally.
</P>
<P>
   For example, religious-school teachers, under the relaxed
neutrality standard, would be able to use the government-supplied
computers in teaching expressly religious courses, O'Connor wrote
in an opinion Breyer joined.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the religious school uses the aid to inculcate religion in
its students, it is reasonable to say that the government has
communicated (an unconstitutional) message of endorsement,''
O'Connor added. ``Because the religious indoctrination is supported
by governmental assistance, the reasonable observer would naturally
perceive the aid program as government support for the advancement
of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   To be constitutional, the governmental aid program to parochial
schools must have safeguards such as official overseers to ensure
that the computers are not being used for religious education,
O'Connor said. She added that the Education Department's program
provides such protection.
</P>
<P>
   In dissent, Justice David H. Souter said the federal program
should be struck down because, contrary to O'Connor's view, no
adequate safeguard exists to ensure that teachers at parochial
schools will not use the computers for sectarian study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where religious indoctrination pervades school activities of
children and adolescents, it takes great care to be able to aid the
school without supporting the doctrinal effort,'' Souter wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Joining his dissent were Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth
Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling marked a defeat for public-school parents in
Jefferson Parish, La., who had challenged the constitutionality of
the government's initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th Circuit had agreed with the parents, saying that the
government's provision of computers unconstitutionally assisted
parochial schools in their religious mission. But the federal
government and religious-school parents successfully appealed to
the Supreme Court.

BUSH SAYS GORE HAS HIS OWN OIL CONNECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Who is more tarred by the big oil companies and
therefore more responsible for the high price of gasoline? That was
the burning question in the presidential contest on Wednesday as
both Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore campaigned in
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The latest accusation came from Bush, who said that although
Gore had accused him of cozying up to big oil, it was really Gore
who was doing so because he had proposed extending a tax break to
the industry for deep-water drilling in search of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp replied that this was a foolish accusation, and
that the tax break provided an incentive for natural-gas
exploration, which could help increase domestic supplies, reduce
dependence on foreign oil and thereby cut energy prices for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange was the latest in an escalating back-and-forth as
each candidate tried to paint the other as less likely to fight to
reduce the price of gas at the pump. Polls show that gas prices
remain Americans' No. 1 concern as they take their summer
vacations.
</P>
<P>
   The prices have risen most sharply here in the Midwest, in the
states most up for grabs in the presidential election. Both
candidates have encouraged a federal investigation into gasoline
prices, which have exceeded $2 a gallon in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he would encourage the foreign oil producers to
increase the supply of crude oil and the domestic industry to
increase exploration, including in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge. Bush also wants to deregulate utilities to spur demand for
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Gore laid out a sweeping plan on Tuesday to reduce dependence on
foreign oil. It would provide more than $125 billion in tax breaks
over 10 years to businesses that provide cleaner forms of energy;
one proposal would extend the moratorium on royalties paid by
natural-gas companies while they drill under the Gulf of Mexico.
The moratorium is scheduled to expire in November.
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign stop here on Wednesday, Bush, a former oil
executive and the recipient of $1.5 million in campaign
contributions from the gas and oil industries, told reporters: ``My
opponent is giving major oil companies a huge tax break. I believe
a royalty moratorium ought to happen when the price declines. We
ought not to have moratoriums when the prices are high.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Gore, said that the tax breaks
would help bring down the cost of fuel and that Bush's position
showed his true colors because it aligned him with the oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This policy provides an incentive to increase domestic energy
production, reduce our dependence on foreign oil and cut energy,''
Hattaway said. ``Bush clearly favors big oil at the expense of
cheaper, cleaner forms of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has received less than $100,000 in contributions from
oil and gas interests, has been casting Bush as the darling of big
oil and more likely to look out for the industry than for the
average consumer. So it was with some zeal that Bush and his aides
seized on the chance to portray the vice president as the one
giving the industry a break.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush went further. He suggested that the oddity of the vice
president's call for tax breaks for the oil industry was emblematic
of a candidate who would ``say anything to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush used both a sledgehammer and a scalpel to make his point.
</P>
<P>
   First, the sledgehammer: ``Al Gore yesterday apparently said he
never made comments about raising prices of gasoline, yet in his
book, `Earth in the Balance,' he advocated higher taxes on fuel use
and he supported a B.T.U. tax, which would raise gasoline prices on
people,'' Bush said. ``When you tax energy, it raises the cost. He
advocated it, strongly advocated it, two such measures, and now
that the political heat is on he's changing his tune. Changing his
tune. He advocates for raising taxes, raising gas prices, and he
denies he ever did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the scalpel: ``This is another example where he doesn't
know the meaning of `raise,''' Bush said. This was a reference to
Gore's quibbling over the definition of the word ``raising'' _ as
in money _ in his April 18 sworn testimony about his fund raising.

FROM IKE TO CLINTON, KNIGHT KEEPS WINNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The winner, and still champion . . . Helen Knight.
</P>
<P>
   El Caballero's remarkable 70-something has done it again,
winning the women's championship at the Tarzana country club for
the 38th time in 44 years.
</P>
<P>
   This time she won the four-week, four-round gross tournament by
14 strokes, pulling away in the final round despite opening play
that day with a triple bogey.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fifth consecutive title for Knight, who won her first
El Cab championship in 1956 _ that victory launching a string of 32
straight titles. Not bad staying power for someone who took her
first golf lesson from Tommy Armour as a University of Michigan
student during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say?'' said Knight, whose title tenure has extended
through the administrations of 12 presidents. ``I had two good
rounds and one round that was not so good. But everybody else had
more than one not-so-good round.''
</P>
<P>
   Others will speak more for the modest but extremely hard-working
Knight:
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of new lady members and it seemed she might have
a battle this year,'' longtime El Cab member Gene Cofsky said.
``But you have to see the way Helen works. She's so dedicated. She
plays Tuesdays, practices Wednesdays and Saturdays, plays Thursdays
or Fridays, plays Sundays . . . and I'm not so sure when the course
is closed on Mondays she doesn't go somewhere else to play. Not
many have her dedication.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's amazing,'' said head pro Mark Taylor, who said Knight's
strengths are accuracy, wedge play and consistency. ``She can go
out there and shoot 85 every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Others speak as supportively with their actions. The El Cab
women honored Knight this year by initiating the Helen Knight
tournament. That net-score event was held the week before the club
championship _ which for nearly a half century has been the
unofficial Helen Knight tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting harder,'' said Knight, whose stretch of club
championships has brought her a letter of congratulations from
Arnold Palmer. ``I'm getting older and they're getting younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight, as famous at El Cab for her work ethic as her
championships, is not content just to repeat a swing that has
proven a winner. She continues to fine-tune her game and has been
working recently with North Ranch teaching pro Laura Hurlbut, a
former LPGA Tour member who has helped simplify Knight's swing.
</P>
<P>
   I feel my swing is more consistent,'' Knight said, ``not based
so much on timing. I'm really excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret to her success?
</P>
<P>
   ``Practice and play,'' she said. ``It's the only way you can do
it. You can't eliminate one of those steps and keep your game
intact.''
</P>

   How long can Knight stretch this remarkable run of club
championships? She said she doesn't really think about it, focusing
instead on the game at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just keep plodding along, do the best you can and try not
to make any dramatic errors,'' she said. ``I was thinking this year
there are younger people coming in and I'm getting older, but you
just keep trying. The worst that can happen is you lose. That's not
so bad. I've had a good run.''

   __ The name sounds familiar: The new head pro at Burbank's De
Bell GC is former Notre Dame High star Scott Scozzola, 24, son of
longtime De Bell head pro Phil Scozzola, who is now the club's
Director of Golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grooming him to take over,'' said the elder Scozzola, who
has been at De Bell since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who went on to New Mexico State to study professional
golf management, has since done stints at Oakmont and Saticoy
country clubs before joining his father at the hillside course in
Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   __ Knights to remember: Scott Scozzola is one of two former
Notre Dame golfers making a move upward in their profession. Kyle
Kovacs, Scozzola's teammate on the Knights in 1993 and now a
playing pro out of Tierra Rejada, has a first and four seconds in
six minitour tournaments this month.

Select Examiner Staffers to Be Answering Questions for a Change &HT;     By DAN FOST  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A select group of reporters and editors at the
San Francisco Examiner will be hearing soon from investigators
hired by the Hearst Corp. to look into whether the paper
compromised its coverage to further Hearst's interests.
</P>
<P>
   Examiner Executive Editor Phil Bronstein said yesterday that the
investigators submitted a list of names to Hearst officials in New
York, and Hearst gave the names to Bronstein.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst announced the investigation in May, after Examiner
Publisher Tim White testified during an antitrust trial that he had
offered Mayor Willie Brown favorable treatment on the paper's
editorial pages in exchange for the mayor's support of Hearst's
efforts to buy The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Although White almost immediately recanted his testimony, it
caused an uproar in journalism circles and Hearst hired former
federal Judge Charles Renfrew to conduct an ``unlimited'' inquiry
into the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Bronstein said he will not be involved in the investigation and
does not expect that his staff will withhold information from
investigators just because he and other higher-ups know that
they're on the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I know everybody who is on the list,''
Bronstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the fact that there's an initial list suggests
the scope or number of people being interviewed.''
</P>
<P>
   A journalism professor said yesterday that such a list does not
necessarily mean the investigation is compromised.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally understandable that you would think it might
taint the investigation,'' said Jack Doppelt, a lawyer and an
associate professor at Northwestern University's Medill School of
Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is a recognized prosecutorial technique: You go to
everybody and you make it known, we want everybody to come to us
knowing that the boss is not going to get upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronstein _ who, according to White's testimony, was at the
fateful lunch with White and Brown _ said he expects to be
interviewed. ``My bosses know I'm an interviewee, and that's not
going to stop me from telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst had agreed last August to buy The Chronicle for $660
million. That agreement was due to expire yesterday if the deal had
not been consummated, but because the antitrust trial had delayed
the closing, Hearst and Chronicle Publishing Co. said they will
extend the deadline to August 31.
</P>
<P>
   THE GATE OPENS UP: Here's a novel effort at employee retention:
double pay.
</P>
<P>
   SFGate.com, the online arm of the San Francisco Chronicle, is
offering its 40 workers a bonus if they stick with the company
until its eventual merger with the Hearst Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: Each week that the deal doesn't close, an
amount equal to that worker's pay for the week is placed into
escrow. If the employee is still around at the time the merger is
consummated, the employee gets the entire sum.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MEDIA29 (104109 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  If the merger isn't complete in December, everyone gets a check,
and the plan gets re-evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Examiner is offering its employees a cash
incentive to stick things out. Bronstein confirmed the deal, but
not the amount, said to be $2,000 for full-time workers.
</P>
<P>
   John Coate, general manager of SFGate, confirmed the arrangement
at his company. ``The competition for talent has never been
greater, that's for sure,'' Coate said.
</P>
<P>
   POST-POSTHOC: Posthoc, an irreverent, lively Web guide to San
Francisco, is holding a wake tonight to mark its second anniversary
_ and the end of production. But don't buy it a plot in the dot-com
graveyard: Posthoc isn't a failed business.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it wasn't a business at all. The site was an
all-volunteer, no-advertising labor of love launched by Susan
MacTavish Best out of her Pacific Heights home two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still run on a clunky old computer, Posthoc _ the name is Latin
for future _ attracts 6,000 to 10,000 unique visitors each day.
</P>
<P>
   Best, 26, quit her job at a public relations agency, took a
class in Web publishing at San Francisco State University, found
five volunteers, and Posthoc was born.
</P>
<P>
   The site offered reviews of restaurants, bands, plays, movies
and more, generally giving a fresh, real-person's view of what to
do in the city. It also featured a range of eclectic writing,
everything from an essay on how to blow the perfect bubble to humor
columns by former Herb Caen pal Strange de Jim. It grew to 100
contributors _ all unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, ``I need to take a little rest,'' Best said. ``I
woke up the other morning and thought, for something that's started
as a hobby, it's gotten huge and out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Best will move the content to another still-unnamed site and try
to figure out a way to use the Posthoc domain to create a viable
business.
</P>
<P>
   She'll be bringing people together at 6:30 tonight at Backflip,
601 Eddy St., San Francisco. But in the Posthoc tradition, it's not
a typical Silicon Valley party: ``We are certainly not paying for
your drinks,'' Best said. ``You can go schmooze off another
dot-com.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SKINNY ON SKINNY: I was on the prowl. I had already noticed
on my own that Skinny DuBaud, the _ dare I say? _ fictitious gossip
columnist on Cnet's News.com, had ceased his frequent updates and
was only dishing his Silicon Valley dirt roughly every other month.
</P>
<P>
   Then I got the tip: Cnet was looking for new writers to give
voice to Skinny. I talked to News.com Editor Jai Singh and his
sidekick, Executive Editor Jeff Pelline, but they stuck to the
story that Skinny was on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   So I sent an e-mail to Cnet reporter Paul Festa, who rumor had
it was Skinny's alter-ego. It would be natural that Festa doesn't
file many Skinny columns; he's a part-timer who writes about
hackers and viruses.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of MEDIA29 (104109 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  I wanted to ask Festa himself, but he was, suspiciously enough,
on an actual vacation. So I waited for his return.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Skinny surfaced. His latest column didn't
mention me by name, but I knew it was me, all right, when he griped
about ``one of those old-media types ( &LR; peskius &LR; 
 &LR; paleojournalist &LR; )'' who had been nosing into his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I waited. Finally this week, Festa returned. I e-mailed
my question: What have you done with Skinny?
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is preposterous on its face,'' Festa replied.
``Skinny is perfectly able to take care of himself, even if his
fondness for Scotch whisky and Cuban cigars occasionally prevents
him from meeting his deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please also keep in mind that while I am the designated
assistant to his secretary Trixie Pixel, everyone on the News.com
staff helps Skinny out with tips and items.''
</P>
<P>
   GOODBYE, GARY: Gary Brickman, a journalist who helped pioneer
the use of video on the Internet, died in his sleep at his San
Francisco home last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Brickman, 38, worked for NBC Internet in San
Francisco as managing editor for broadband. Brickman was a fixture
on the tech scene, arriving in his wheelchair and getting at the
personalities behind the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``He drove this beat-up old van all over the Bay Area and went
to every event and every trade show,'' said Jeff Pundyk, who was
his editor at CMP Media's Internet publication TechWeb. ``He knew
everybody. He was such a distinguished figure _ he was one of the
most recognizable personalities in the industry.''

   Breakthroughs to help those who need portable power &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's a schlepp being a road warrior. But life is
about to get easier for mobile professionals, if some of the new
technologies on display here at PC Expo live up to their promise.
</P>
<P>
   Ultralight notebooks with an astonishing eight hours of battery
life and wireless Internet access that's three times faster than
56K dialup are two breakthroughs that could transform being a
digital nomad.
</P>
<P>
   The notebooks are the first to use the new low-power Crusoe chip
from Santa Clara, Calif.'s Transmeta Corp. Running at speeds up to
700 MHz, Crusoe is more power-efficient than other microprocessors,
as well as cooler so it doesn't require a built-in fan, according
to Transmeta.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, Hitachi, Fujitsu and NEC all showed technology demos of
Crusoe-based laptops in Transmeta's shipwreck-themed booth. None
are yet committing to when _ or whether _ they will deliver laptops
with the technology, although they acted coyly optimistic about
their lightweight (3.5 pounds or less) prototypes.
</P>
<P>
   IBM showed a version of its ThinkPad 240 with a 600-MHz Crusoe
chip. While the current model, which is now based on a 500-MHz
Pentium III or Celeron 450, gets four hours of battery life with
standard business applications, the Crusoe prototype is getting
more than seven hours, according to David Nichols, manager of IBM
Mobile Computing.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols said it is likely that IBM will come out with a Crusoe
notebook in the second half of the year. Pricing would be
comparable to that of the current ThinkPad 240, which is $2,399.
</P>
<P>
   But IBM would market the Crusoe laptop to the entrepreneur and
education markets, rather than the much &LR;   &LR; larger corporate world.
That's because the Crusoe chip achieves its low power consumption
by moving some functions to software, rather than hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nichols said IBM's testing has not shown any
compatibility problems, he thinks corporate users would be
concerned about whether the new approach would adversely affect
legacy applications.
</P>
<P>
   Bob O'Donnell, an analyst with research firm IDC in Mountain
View, Calif., agreed. ``Corporate IS managers are extremely
conservative and I think they'll be very hesitant to jump to a
whole new processor architecture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even AMD had a hard time trying to make any inroads, and AMD
is directly derivative (of chip leader Intel).''
</P>
<P>
   And Intel, which had a mammoth booth right next to Transmeta's,
isn't standing still. Last week, it announced the Mobile Pentium
III, a chip that will directly compete with Crusoe.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Sony and Toshiba are already shipping laptops
based on the new chip. A lightweight Sony notebook is getting five
hours of battery life, an Intel representative said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of PCEXPO29 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  But at Toshiba's booth, Steven Andler, vice president of
marketing for portables, said the new Intel chip extends battery
life by only about 15 percent. Toshiba's Portege 3480 gets three
hours of battery life using the new chip.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta may have an edge over Intel for at least one market:
Linux enthusiasts. Linux guru Linus Torvalds is an executive with
Transmeta. Although all the prototype laptops were Windows systems,
theoretically they could run Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Crusoe isn't just for laptops. Transmeta is pitching it for
``information appliances'' as well.
</P>
<P>
   It showed off sleek prototype Web pads, similar to those Gateway
and America Online might produce under their recent deal with
Transmeta.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of options for staying connected on the road,
most of them mediocre. Users who want full-speed Internet
connections can seek out phone lines and dial up to nationwide
ISPs, which will get them online at 56 Kbps.
</P>
<P>
   Those toting personal digital assistants, two-way pagers and
cell phones can tap into wireless networks at speeds under 8 Kbps,
adequate for sending and receiving e-mails, sans attachments and
browsing simplified text-only Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Some airports and hotels are beginning to install wireless
Ethernet connections that in turn connect to high-speed options
like T-1 lines, a great solution for the lucky folks who visit
those particular airports and hotels and who have wireless Ethernet
cards.
</P>
<P>
   But Los Gatos firm Metricom says it may have a better idea. For
five years, the company has offered a radio-based network called
Ricochet in the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle and Washington,
D.C., operating at about 28.8 Kbps, half the speed of a dialup
modem. It's drawn 30,000 users, many of them devotedly loyal to the
service that unleashed them from their offices.
</P>
<P>
   Now Metricom is spending $1.5 billion to roll out its Ricochet
wireless network in 46 cities _ at a speed of 128 Kbps. In demos,
Ricochet's service allowed video and animations to play smoothly,
and Web searches to return quick results. Since 56K dialup
connections actually achieve throughput of about 40 Kbps, Metricom
says its solution is three times as fast.
</P>
<P>
   Ricochet users will enjoy ``an office experience untethered from
the office,'' said Timothy Dreisbach, Metricom's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The service will roll out in Atlanta and San Diego by the end of
July. An additional 19 communities will get coverage before the end
of the year. The Bay Area should be up and running with 128K
Ricochet by September. Metricom said 25 more cities will have
coverage by next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The coverage isn't just for the core cities; it's averaging
1,000 square miles in each community. In the San Francisco Bay
Area, coverage will encompass six counties that ring the bay:
Alameda, Contra Costa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara and
Marin. The service area will stretch as far north as Vallejo,
Calif., and as far east as Antioch, Calif., and down to the
intersection of highways 101 and 85 in the South Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Users will have to pay for the convenience. Modems are likely to
be about $250 to $300; monthly fees will range from $60 to $100 for
unlimited usage.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: Metricom installs shoebox-size microcell
radios on lightpoles throughout its service area; about three to
five per square mile. It has wired access points, essentially big
routers, installed in every few square miles. Laptop radio modems
communicate with the poletop boxes, which in turn send packet-based
data to and from the wired boxes, which make the connection to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of PCEXPO29 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  For now, Metricom is the fastest mobile wireless solution.
Cellular companies are eager to get in on the data act. They
already offer wireless Web access, but at pokey speeds. They hope
to upgrade their networks to handle fast data traffic; the question
is how fast they can do it and what speed they can achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Metricom's service will be available through various partners,
such as MCI WorldCom and Juno Express, Juno's high-speed service.
</P>
<P>
   Metricom has a hefty war chest to help in its efforts. Last year
it landed $300 million each in backing from Paul Allen's Vulcan
Ventures and from MCI WorldCom. It raised an additional $900
million in February from public equity and debt offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Chipmaker National Semiconductor is now designing a special
Ricochet chipset that will allow devices ranging from PDAs to
laptops to come with built-in Ricochet capability.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, users can buy external modems about the size of a
pack of cigarettes, or PC Card modems that slide into a laptop
slot.
</P>
<P>
   With Ricochet, ``you can surf the Web or check your e-mail while
you're sitting in a meeting,'' said Gail Bronson, a senior analyst
at IPO Monitor in Palo Alto, Calif., and a Silicon Valley startup
executive. ``It lets you multitask without a connection.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said it's too bad that Metricom has stopped selling
its older modem. The current 28K service is only $30 a month; the
faster service's price ``will be a little dicey for a certain group
of people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, O'Donnell said, ``For a mobile professional, it's a dream
come true. One twenty-eight always on, that's a great way to go.''

BofA Exec Announces Early Resignation &HT;     By KELLY ZITO 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The last top-ranking executive from the old Bank
of America resigned yesterday, turning the reins of the bank's
corporate and global banking unit over to his successor-in-training
more than a year early.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murray, who weathered the takeover by North Carolina's
NationsBank, will leave his post as president of Bank of America
Global Corporate and Investment Banking on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Brown, the division's deputy head, will succeed Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said the timing of his announcement _ he wasn't expected
to leave the bank until late 2001 _ had to do with both personal
and professional reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Brown took on more responsibility this summer as part of a
transition plan outlined in January. As that happened, ``I realized
it's not in my ability to be happy and functional as a fifth
wheel,'' Murray said. ``And I know if I was taking over (the
division) I wouldn't want me there.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, 56, said family commitments also played into his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year banking veteran said he will spend time replanting
his Sonoma vineyard and ``enjoying eating my own cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray downplayed the fact that his departure is the beginning
of a new era for the bank, which was taken over by NationsBank,
based in Charlotte, N.C., 19 months ago. Murray joined BofA in
1994, when the company bought Chicago's Continental Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new company, and the new company is going to continue
to change and evolve and this is part of that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of BOFA29 (42141 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Murray was the last remaining executive from the original Bank of
America, based in San Francisco. After the acrimonious NationsBank
takeover, many San Francisco executives, including chief executive
David Coulter, were forced out.
</P>
<P>
   Murray insisted that the same fate hasn't befallen him.
</P>
<P>
   But one industry watcher was more skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``NationsBank is an organization that has a pretty significant
old boys network associated with it, and obviously, as part of Bank
of America, Mike wasn't part of that,'' said Lawrence Cohn, an
analyst at the New Jersey brokerage Ryan Beck.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his outsider status at the combined bank, Murray's unit
thrived.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the corporate bank earned $2.6 billion of the bank's
total $8.2 billion in profits _ a solid 18 percent return on
equity. In the first quarter of this year, the division earned $960
million, a 26 percent return on equity.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said the unit's headquarters will remain in San
Francisco. The division employs about 4,400 in the San Francisco
Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn said he didn't expect Murray's resignation to have any
sizable impact on the bank.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, ``It will have an effect on morale in that
unit. Mike was a popular guy who was well respected and well
liked.''

Providian to Return Millions &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Credit card giant Providian Financial Corp.
agreed yesterday to pay more than $305 million to settle charges it
cheated customers, a devastating rebuke to one of San Francisco's
biggest and fastest-growing businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with the San Francisco district attorney's office,
the California attorney general and federal bank regulators ends a
yearlong probe of the company that uncovered ``a web of deceptive
and misleading business practices,'' District Attorney Terence
Hallinan said in a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, as earlier reported, Providian will set
aside a minimum of $300 million to repay customers who were fooled
into buying products they didn't want. The nation's sixth-largest
bank credit card issuer will also pay the city a $5.5 million fine.
The company didn't admit wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the most significant consumer recoveries in the
history of the United States,'' said California Attorney General
Bill Lockyer, whose agency signed the agreement though it wasn't a
party to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   For the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the
agency that supervises nationally chartered banks, the case
represented a bold assertion of its authority over consumer
matters. The agency cited for the first time federal trade laws
barring unfair and deceptive practices as the basis for its action,
taking it beyond the narrowly drawn consumer regulations it has
traditionally enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're utilizing a tool nobody has used before,`` said First
Senior Deputy Comptroller Julie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Providian agreed to make a sweeping series
of changes in its direct mail and telemarketing sales techniques
over the next 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the company will have to describe how products such
as credit protection work before it enrolls customers, not after it
has signed them on. Providian's credit protection program lets
customers skip payments if they lose their jobs or become disabled.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, prosecutors and regulators from the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency must approve certain Providian sales
scripts for an extended period.
</P>
<P>
   Providian officials said the company settled the case to remove
a cloud that has hung over it since the district attorney's
investigation came to light more than a year ago. Prosecutors said
they began their probe after receiving hundreds of customer
complaints about Providian's sales tactics.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with reporters, Chief Executive Officer
Shailesh Mehta said the company has already put in place
wide-ranging changes in its sales methods.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of PROVIDIA () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Providian's willingness to accept harsh sanctions was ``a
business decision,'' Mehta said. He said the company didn't do
anything wrong, but ``needed to lay this matter to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming to terms ``was a very tough decision for me,'' he added.
``I wanted to fight it. I had to let go of my emotional side.''
</P>
<P>
   The company still faces consumer lawsuits in state and federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement mainly covers alleged deception in the sale of
two products: credit protection and balance transfers from other
card issuers.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who believe they were victimized won't have to contact
the company. Under the supervision of prosecutors and bank
regulators, Providian will have to identify and compensate clients
who may have been harmed.
</P>
<P>
   Providian's legal woes mark the biggest challenge the company
has faced since it was spun off in 1997 by its former parent, a
Kentucky insurer also known as Providian. Since the spin-off,
Providian has been one of the area's fastest-growing nontechnology
companies, specializing in extending credit to customers who have
scant or troubled borrowing histories.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company's earnings zoomed 85.6 percent to $550.3
million as it nearly doubled revenue. Much of those gains came from
peddling fee-based products, such a credit protection. Providian
operates huge call centers in Pleasanton and other locations where
batteries of telemarketers use hard-sell tactics to pitch products
such as credit protection.
</P>
<P>
   Providian's backers have said the company's sales methods
weren't any worse than those used by many other banks and card
issuers.
</P>
<P>
   The company was a Wall Street favorite until news of the
district attorney's investigation caused the stock to plunge. It
has never fully recovered. The company's shares rose $2.07
yesterday to $85.07, well below the high of $131.62 posted last
year.
</P>
<P>
   While some analysts said the restrictions on Providian will have
little affect on its profits, others insisted the company will be
handcuffed in the marketplace. The company may sell fewer products
such as credit protection if customers have a chance to think about
what they are buying, the analysts warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe they will be able to sustain the rate of
growth they've had,'' said Kathleen Shanley, a credit analyst with
the firm Gimme Credit, which rates corporate bonds.

ARCHBISHOP RELEASED AFTER NINE HOURS AS HOSTAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The archbishop of San Antonio, Texas'
highest-ranking Roman Catholic, spent nine hours as a hostage
Wednesday before being freed unharmed by a man facing deportation
and claiming he carried a live grenade.
</P>
<P>
   ``God came down with a smile on his face for us today,'' San
Antonio Police Chief Al Philliphus said in announcing the release
of Archbishop Patrick Flores and the arrest of his captor shortly
after 7 p.m. CDT.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, 70, who suffers from chronic back pain, was placed on a
stretcher and taken to a hospital for observation.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage-taker was identified as Nelson Antonio Escolero, 40,
who also goes by the name of Carlos Cruz. He was booked into jail
pending a variety of charges, including terroristic threats,
unauthorized detainment and possible weapons charges, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The grenadelike device he threatened to detonate was confiscated
and was being examined Wednesday night to determine whether it was
real.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of deportation apparently stems from Escolero's
criminal past, which includes marijuana possession, burglary of an
automobile and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Escolero, whose wife and three children were on the chancery
grounds throughout the ordeal, was described as distraught over
possible deportation and said he chose to take Flores hostage
because of the archbishop's sympathy to human rights causes,
Philliphus said.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point in the negotiations came when authorities
obtained documents related to the case and faxed them, as
instructed, to the archbishop's office, Philliphus said.
</P>
<P>
   Flores then explained them to Escolero, and the man kept his
promise to release him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no desire to hurt the archbishop,'' Philliphus said.
</P>
<P>
   The police chief praised Flores as courageous and a skillful
negotiator who participated in talks with hostage negotiators
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty smooth today,'' Philliphus said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, believed to be from El Salvador, took Flores and his
secretary hostage about 10 a.m. but released the woman about two
hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Catholics mingled outside the chancery throughout the
day, praying nonstop for the safety of the country's first
Mexican-American Roman Catholic bishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the sake of his sorrowful passion, have mercy on us and on
the whole world,'' they repeated in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Pytel, an office manager in the chancery, was among the 100
or so people evacuated at 10:15 a.m. She stayed nearby all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were determined to keep the vigil and support our
archbishop,'' Pytel said. ``We waited, we watched, we prayed and we
hoped. And we were so relieved that it all ended peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of police, FBI agents and SWAT officers surrounded the
chancery shortly after Flores and his secretary, Myrtle Sanchez,
were taken hostage. About 100 employees of the chancery were
quickly evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Before Flores' release, Kenneth Thompson, executive director of
the San Antonio Community of Churches, prayed for the man to
release the archbishop unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has taken hostage the man who probably cares the most and
is most willing to listen,'' he said. ``One of his known strengths
is his ability to stay quiet and to listen. He is a humble person
and he is willing to sit there and listen to you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he wants this to end very peacefully,'' said the Rev.
David Garcia, an associate of the archbishop since 1970, when
Flores came to San Antonio as an auxiliary bishop. Garcia said.
``He probably wouldn't even want the man arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said Flores will be 71 on July 26 and is in good health.
</P>
<P>
   ``His only complaint are some lower back problems,'' Garcia
said.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop was among several American and Latin-American
Catholic clergy detained in 1976 by military leaders in Ecuador.
Flores was placed under house arrest with the others.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Eddie Bernal is a San Antonio native who grew up a
half-mile from the scene of yesterday's crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been very accessible, very kind and very
compassionate,'' Bernal said of the archbishop. ``He will give
anybody an audience at any time he is available. He will continue
that practice, God willing. I don't see him changing.''
</P>
<P>
   The news of the archbishop's release was met with cheers and
tears among onlookers at the chancery, many of whom had been there
throughout the 90-degree afternoon heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is proof that the miracle of prayer works,'' said
Louisette Zuritha, 25, a San Antonio Catholic school music teacher.
``We are all so relieved. He is a wonderful, wonderful man.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, negotiators reported that they could hear
Flores ``in the background'' as they chatted with his captor.
</P>
<P>
   Although the man claimed to be armed with a grenade, Sanchez saw
only what she could describe as a weapon, said Monsignor Larry
Stuebben, who spoke to the woman after her release.
</P>
<P>
   Flores and his secretary were taken captive when a man entered
the archbishop's office on the third floor to discuss an
immigration problem in Spanish, said Richard Yzaguirre, general
manager of Catholic Television.
</P>
<P>
   While the man did not raise his voice, he ``was pretty insistent
he wanted him to help him with this problem,'' Yzaguirre told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The man was ``very frustrated by the way he's been treated, and
wants the archbishop to help him,'' Stuebben said Sanchez reported
shortly after her release.
</P>
<P>
   Stuebben quoted Sanchez as saying, ``He said only that he wants
a great variety of papers saying he has been mistreated by various
segments of government.''
</P>
<P>
   The chancery office complex serves as the diocese's local
headquarters and sits on about 40 acres that includes Assumption
Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II stayed at the complex when he visited San
Antonio in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Leticia Nieto, who lives near the chancery, watched the drama
from a front stoop with her mother, Kata Flores.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done so much to help this community, and not just the
Catholics,'' Nieto said. ``He helped fund music programs for
inner-city kids and sports programs and all kinds of things. He is
an amazing man.''
</P>
<P>
   Kata Flores described the archbishop as humble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will not put himself above you,'' she said. ``He will meet
with you at your level.'' &QL;

`A SELECTION': A DANCE OF SURREAL IMAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Japan)   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alas, the first program in Pilobolus Dance Theater's
new season at the Joyce Theater is more or less a bust. The
exception among the four pieces on Tuesday night was ``A
Selection,'' created last year in collaboration with Maurice Sendak
and Arthur Yorinks, directors of the Night Kitchen, a children's
theater company.
</P>
<P>
   As an artist, Sendak has contributed not only a backdrop (a town
aflame in the scary but compelling style of his book illustrations)
but also an outside eye. ``A Selection,'' a phantasmagoria on a
Holocaust theme, was commissioned by the American Dance Festival,
which just awarded the company its Samuel H. Scripps-American Dance
Festival Award for achievement in modern dance.
</P>
<P>
   The piece is full of enigmatic images with surreal and
fearlessly tossed bodies. They are stunningly rendered by the
troupe, especially Otis Cook as the rubber-legged personification
of evil. Above all the work does not share divorce between ideas
and movement as evident in the rest of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tsu-Ku-Tsu,'' a New York premiere, had all the earmarks of a
work created on assignment. The springboard was a match between
Pilobolus and Leonard Eto, a Japanese musician who takes a
contemporary approach to the taiko drums, which are familiar from
tours of Kodo drummers. Eto had approached the Dance Umbrella,
producer of experimental dance in Boston, for a collaborative
project and was commissioned to work with Pilobolus.
</P>
<P>
   This was not an outlandish choice: one of the group's early and
best duets was ``Shizen,'' accompanied by the haunting melody of a
Japanese flute. But Alison Chase, who choreographed the new piece
with help from the dancers, was faced here with percussion and
rhythm. The beat and reverberation at the core of Eto's complex
performance onstage are too dominant for the Pilobolus style.
</P>
<P>
   This is movement that usually banks on the linkage and leverage
of bodies, which are reduced here to an image to two mini-sumo
wrestlers locked in a hold. Elsewhere the choreography tends toward
mere gymnastics without the metaphoric dimension one expects from
Pilobolus.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of transformation nonetheless informs the initial image
after Eto raises an arm to strike a big hanging drum before he
moves on to the small drums. As Steven Strawbridge's lighting
changes from near-obscurity, three crouched figures in Angelina
Avallone's short kimonos are revealed to be six dancers (three on
the backs of three others).
</P>
<P>
   A faster beat sends them rolling and tumbling on the floor.
Springs in the air, cartwheels and dives precede the sumo duet for
Cook and Gaspard Louis. Matt Kent and Benjamin Pring are part of
some entangled clusters: Rebecca Anderson and Josie Coyoc, first
leaning head to head, arch into backbends that leave them legs up.
</P>
<P>
   Some might see their grouping as a plant. Objectively, it is one
of several isolated episodes. The end recalls the old nightclub
acrobatic adagio acts: upright performers supported in a fanny lift
by a partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Femme Noire,'' choreographed by Chase in collaboration with
Anderson and Rebecca Stenn, was a sketch on an
angst-behind-the-glamour theme. Anderson, as a fashion model doing
the backstroke on the floor and playing with a picture hat, did her
best with a minimum of material.
</P>
<P>
   The sincerity behind ``Gnomen,'' a male quartet, is not in
doubt, but neither is its sanctimonious tone. Cook, Kent, Louis and
Pring each took turns as the protagonist either succored or stoned
by the others.

<P>
   HAVANA _ Hours after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear any
more arguments in the Elian Gonzalez case, the 6-year-old left
behind seven months of contention, conflict and court battles, and
returned home to Cuba Wednesday with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Elian arrived to the embrace of relatives and the excited cheers
of hundreds of his flag-waving schoolmates. A crowd of students
hurriedly bused in from their hometown of Cardenas waved flags and
chanted: ``Elian! Elian!''
</P>
<P>
   They arrived just in time to meet the two planes that ferried
Elian, his father and other friends and relatives from Washington.
Moments later, his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, carried the boy
off the plane and into the arms of his grandparents, including his
two grandmothers, who had made an unsuccessful journey to reclaim
the boy in January.
</P>
<P>
   As the boy was swept up in the arms of his grandfather, his
schoolmates began singing the Cuban national anthem, as the
television announcer described the scene
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the torture they said Elian would be subjected to,''
the announcer said, referring to the claims by Cuban-Americans that
the boy was being returned to a grim fate. ``That is passion. That
is affection.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the excitement of the small crowd at the airport, Elian
was quiet, waving at times to his friends. No public remarks were
made, and Cuban officials did not plan any news conferences or
rallies.
</P>
<P>
   President Fidel Castro did not greet the child at Jose Marti
International Airport, being represented instead by Ricardo
Alarcon, the president of the National Assembly, who has guided the
campaign for Elian's return. The airport ceremony lasted only 10
minutes before the child and his entourage were whisked off in a
caravan to an undisclosed location for a long-awaited reunion.
</P>
<P>
   The homecoming was subdued, with no other rallies or marches
taking place in the city. But Cubans were reminded of the
importance of Elian's return, much the same way that Castro had
seized on it as a case of national respect, and a way to win points
in his long battle with the United States. In countless past
rallies, the case had been used to criticize the trade embargo, the
conservative Cuban American National Foundation and the Cuban
Adjustment Act, which grants asylum to Cubans who reach U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   As national television broadcast the caravan leaving the
airport, the voice of Elpidio Valdes, Elian's favorite cartoon
character, took over the narration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome, Eliancito,'' he said. ``Now we have to keep the
battle against the Cuban Adjustment Act, the blockade and the
foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian, his father, his stepmother, Nersy, and his half brother,
Hianny, left Dulles International Airport in Virginia at 4:41 p.m.,
just hours after the Supreme Court declined to hear arguments
presented by lawyers for Elian's relatives in Miami that the child
had been denied a right to an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   As Elian and his family made their way to the airport,
television viewers watched a strikingly familiar scene from the
vantage of helicopters as the motorcade snaked its way along
traffic-free highways, a white Suburban in the lead. The coverage
was reminiscent of the white Bronco chase at the start of the O.J.
Simpson murder case in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In November, a failed crossing from Cuba drowned Elian's mother
and 10 others and left the boy floating alone in an inner-tube off
the Florida coast. The Supreme Court's decision Wednesday was the
final development in a series of court challenges brought by
Elian's Miami relatives, who cared for the boy after he was rescued
last Thanksgiving until immigration agents reunited him with his
father in late April.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the announcement in Washington Wednesday that
Elian could go home, Cuban radio and television interrupted their
programming to proclaim the boy's impending arrival once the
injunction that kept the child and his father in the United States
expired at 4 p.m. All day, announcers praised Elian as a heroic boy
and model child, whose father showed courage and dignity throughout
the custody battle. Pastoral music played softly in the background
as images of Elian hugging his father or frolicking with his
friends in a pool slowly dissolved on the screen, giving way to an
image of the Cuban flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian had to return,'' said Roberto Perez Martinez, who was
drinking a beer with some friends in the Playa section of Havana.
``When a child is caught in the middle, people get upset. At 17 if
he wants to go on a raft, it does not matter. But today he must
come home.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian was to go from the airport to a reunion with relatives and
friends at an undisclosed location. From there, he would go for an
undetermined period to a special school in Havana, where teachers
and psychologists would prepare him for his return to Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the airport, Elian's father, said in brief
remarks that his experience in the United States had been a good
one. He said he hoped Cuba and the United States would strengthen
their ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all my family's suffering, I think that this has
allowed me to meet very beautiful and brilliant people in this
country,'' Gonzalez said. ``And I hope in the future, this same
impression I took from this country, can become true between Cuba
and the United States.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, asked at a news conference whether he had any
reservations about Elian's return home and his administration's
role in the outcome, said Wednesday that he had replayed it all in
his head many times, and concluded that his administration did the
proper thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I wish it had unfolded in a less dramatic, traumatic way
for all concerned?'' Clinton asked. ``Of course, I do.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, he said, is the father's right to be with his
child, and the fact that Gonzalez was found to be a ``good'' and
``loving father.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's rescue and the attempts of his Miami relatives to keep
him in the United States unleashed an international drama that
complicated the United States' relationship with Cuba. In the end,
the drama embroiled the White House, stirred up the presidential
campaign, revitalized Fidel Castro and tarnished the standing of
the politically powerful Cuban-American population in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   And in a twist that few could have anticipated, the case, and
its handling by Cuban-Americans, helped galvanize support in the
United States for more relaxed ties to Cuba. On Tuesday, Congress
negotiated a deal to permit food sales to Cuba, with restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami Wednesday, supporters of the Miami relatives gathered
outside the Little Havana house to mourn Elian's return to Havana.
A few lashed out at reporters and cursed the Clinton
administration. Many praised the Miami relatives for their
persistence, and expressed disbelief that most Americans believe
Elian belongs in Communist Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are devastated that at this very moment Elian's going back
to live in a country where he'll never be free, to a country where
his father will simply not be allowed to give him the freedom that
his mother, Elisabeth Brotons, wanted so desperately and died for,
to a country of tyranny and dictatorship,'' said Armando Gutierrez,
the spokesman for the boy's Miami relatives. ``But we must obey the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who had tried to persuade the Miami
relatives, face to face, to turn the boy over, wished Elian well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This little boy now knows that he can remain with his
father,'' Reno said in a statement Wednesday. ``All involved have
had an opportunity to make their case _ all the way to the highest
court in the land. I hope that everyone will accept the Supreme
Court's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department spent at least $1.8 million through June
11 on reuniting Elian with his father, assigning scores of
officials and negotiators to the case.
</P>
<P>
   The legal challenge began in Miami, where Lazaro Gonzalez,
Elian's great-uncle, petitioned the courts for custody and for the
right to request an asylum hearing for the boy. That was denied,
and Gonzalez carried out a series of appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana Wednesday, there were few joyous outbursts, in
contrast to the huge public rallies that had taken place across
Cuba calling for Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   A few people sported worn-out Elian T-shirts that were worn by
hundreds of thousands at past rallies. The sprawling seaside plaza
that was specially built in January to hold demonstrations in front
of the offices of the U.S. government here was unusually empty.
</P>
<P>
   Many people quietly expressed relief that the boy was returning
after months of what they said was manipulation by Cuban-Americans
in Miami, whom they faulted for having tried to sway the child with
gifts, favors and the promise of a better life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time he came back to be with his family, his people,''
one woman said.

the custody battle. Pastoral music played softly in the background
as images of Elian hugging his father or frolicking with his
friends in a pool slowly dissolved on the screen, giving way to an
image of the Cuban flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian had to return,'' said Roberto Perez Martinez, who was
drinking a beer with some friends in the Playa section of Havana.
``When a child is caught in the middle, people get upset. At 17 if
he wants to go on a raft, it does not matter. But today he must
come home.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian was to go from the airport to a reunion with relatives and
friends at an undisclosed location. From there, he would go for an
undetermined period to a special school in Havana, where teachers
and psychologists would prepare him for his return to Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the airport, Elian's father, said in brief
remarks that his experience in the United States had been a good
one. He said he hoped Cuba and the United States would strengthen
their ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all my family's suffering, I think that this has
allowed me to meet very beautiful and brilliant people in this
country,'' Gonzalez said. ``And I hope in the future, this same
impression I took from this country, can become true between Cuba
and the United States.''

</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, asked at a news conference whether he had any
reservations about Elian's return home and his administration's
role in the outcome, said Wednesday that he had replayed it all in
his head many times, and concluded that his administration did the
proper thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I wish it had unfolded in a less dramatic, traumatic way
for all concerned?'' Clinton asked. ``Of course, I do.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, he said, is the father's right to be with his
child, and the fact that Gonzalez was found to be a ``good'' and
``loving father.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's rescue and the attempts of his Miami relatives to keep
him in the United States unleashed an international drama that
complicated the United States' relationship with Cuba. In the end,
the drama embroiled the White House, stirred up the presidential
campaign, revitalized Fidel Castro and tarnished the standing of
the politically powerful Cuban-American population in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   And in a twist that few could have anticipated, the case, and
its handling by Cuban-Americans, helped galvanize support in the
United States for more relaxed ties to Cuba. On Tuesday, Congress
negotiated a deal to permit food sales to Cuba, with restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami Wednesday, supporters of the Miami relatives gathered
outside the Little Havana house to mourn Elian's return to Havana.
A few lashed out at reporters and cursed the Clinton
administration. Many praised the Miami relatives for their
persistence, and expressed disbelief that most Americans believe
Elian belongs in Communist Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are devastated that at this very moment Elian's going back
to live in a country where he'll never be free, to a country where
his father will simply not be allowed to give him the freedom that
his mother, Elisabeth Brotons, wanted so desperately and died for,
to a country of tyranny and dictatorship,'' said Armando Gutierrez,
the spokesman for the boy's Miami relatives. ``But we must obey the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who had tried to persuade the Miami
relatives, face to face, to turn the boy over, wished Elian well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This little boy now knows that he can remain with his
father,'' Reno said in a statement Wednesday. ``All involved have
had an opportunity to make their case _ all the way to the highest
court in the land. I hope that everyone will accept the Supreme
Court's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department spent at least $1.8 million through June
11 on reuniting Elian with his father, assigning scores of
officials and negotiators to the case.
</P>
<P>
   The legal challenge began in Miami, where Lazaro Gonzalez,
Elian's great-uncle, petitioned the courts for custody and for the
right to request an asylum hearing for the boy. That was denied,
and Gonzalez carried out a series of appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana Wednesday, there were few joyous outbursts, in
contrast to the huge public rallies that had taken place across
Cuba calling for Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   A few people sported worn-out Elian T-shirts that were worn by
hundreds of thousands at past rallies. The sprawling seaside plaza
that was specially built in January to hold demonstrations in front
of the offices of the U.S. government here was unusually empty.
</P>
<P>
   Many people quietly expressed relief that the boy was returning
after months of what they said was manipulation by Cuban-Americans
in Miami, whom they faulted for having tried to sway the child with
gifts, favors and the promise of a better life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time he came back to be with his family, his people,''
one woman said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday by a 5--4 vote
that the government cannot prohibit doctors from performing a
procedure widely known as ``partial-birth abortion'' because it may
be the most medically appropriate way of terminating some
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   The decision declared unconstitutional the Nebraska law before
the court and, in effect, the laws of 30 other states. In addition,
the bill to create a federal ban on the procedure, which President
Clinton has vetoed twice and which may reach his desk again this
year, would also be unconstitutional under the court's analysis:
like all the other laws, it does not contain an exception for the
health of the pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, with a majority opinion by Justice Stephen G.
Breyer, was analytically broader than many people expected, finding
fault not only with the law's concededly imprecise language, but
with the absence of an exception for women's health. At the same
time, the 5-4 vote was unexpectedly close for a court where support
for the underlying right to abortion has been counted as 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the broad ruling and the close vote led Janet
Benshoof, president of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy,
which represented the Nebraska doctor who challenged the law, to
describe the day as one for ``champagne and shivers.'' The
immediate reaction from politicians and advocates on both sides of
the abortion debate made it likely that the court's future
composition would be the subject of greater than usual focus during
the remainder of this election year.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, one of four Wednesday that totaled 391 pages, came
on the final day of the court's term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Partial-birth abortion'' is the term opponents of abortion use
to describe a method that doctors use infrequently to terminate
pregnancies after about 16 weeks. Anti-abortion forces coined the
term in the mid-1990s and have focused on graphic descriptions of
the procedure as a way of undermining public support for abortion.
Wednesday's ruling represents a significant setback to that
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's dissenting opinion was a major
surprise to both sides of the abortion debate. Not only his
disagreement with the majority, but also the terms in which he
expressed his views both in this case and in a second
abortion-related decision Wednesday indicated Kennedy's deep unease
with a 1992 decision, of which he was a joint author, that had
reaffirmed the right to abortion. The second decision upheld
restrictions on demonstrations outside abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing what he described as the ``consequential moral
difference'' between the ``partial-birth'' method and other
abortion procedures, Kennedy said that in its 1997 law, Nebraska
``chose to forbid a procedure many decent and civilized people find
so abhorrent as to be among the most serious of crimes against
human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg
in an opinion concurring with the majority, said it was ``simply
irrational'' to find a fundamental difference in one procedure over
another. Stevens said it was ``impossible for me to understand how
a state has any legitimate interest in requiring a doctor to follow
any procedure other than the one that he or she reasonably believes
will best protect the woman'' in exercising the constitutional
right to obtain an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the nine justices _ all but David H. Souter, who joined
Breyer's majority opinion _ wrote opinions in the case, Stenberg
vs. Carhart, No. 99-830. In addition to Souter, Stevens and
Ginsburg, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor joined the majority opinion.
In addition to Kennedy, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas wrote dissenting
opinions.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In striking down the Nebraska law, the majority went further
than the federal appeals court whose decision the court upheld
Wednesday. The 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, in St. Louis, had
found Nebraska's law unconstitutional because, while it was
ostensibly aimed only at a particular type of late-term abortion,
its vague wording would chill doctors in performing a common
second-trimester abortion procedure that undoubtedly had
constitutional protection under the Supreme Court's precedents.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court agreed with that analysis but went on to rule
that even a more precisely worded statute that avoided that problem
would still be unconstitutional in the absence of a health
exception.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying medical opinion on the subject, Breyer said there was
a ``substantial likelihood'' that the method at issue was ``a safer
abortion method in certain circumstances.'' He added, ``If so, then
the absence of a health exception will place women at an
unnecessary risk of tragic health consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Breyer called the ruling ``a straightforward application'' of
the court's 1992 ruling in Planned Parenthood vs. Casey, which
reaffirmed the 1973 ruling in Roe vs. Wade. But the dissenters
disagreed and said the decision went further in the direction of
protecting an unqualified right to abortion. Kennedy, an author of
the Casey decision, said the ruling today was based on a
``misunderstanding'' of that decision and ``contradicts Casey's
assurance that the state's constitutional position in the realm of
promoting respect for life is more than marginal.''
</P>
<P>
   James Bopp, general counsel of the National Right to Life
Committee, which drafted the model law on which the Nebraska
statute and many of the others were based, called the decision a
``radical expansion of the right to abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Nebraska law, a doctor who performed a ``partial-birth
abortion'' that was not necessary to save a woman's life faced a
sentence of up to 20 years in prison. The law was successfully
challenged in U.S. District Court in Omaha by Dr. Leroy Carhart and
has never taken effect. Carhart and his wife, Mary, were in the
courtroom Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The statute defined the procedure as ``an abortion procedure in
which the person performing the abortion partially delivers
vaginally a living unborn child before killing the unborn child and
completing the delivery.'' That was defined further to mean
``deliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina a
living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof'' before
terminating the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska's attorney general, Don Stenberg, argued that the state
Legislature meant to ban one specific procedure, known in the
medical profession as dilation and extraction, or D &AMP; X. In that
procedure, used beginning in about 16 weeks of pregnancy when the
fetus' head has grown too big to pass safely through an undilated
cervix, doctors seeking to keep the fetus as intact as possible for
various reasons extract it feet first and then use a sharp
instrument to collapse the fetal skull.
</P>
<P>
   But the lower courts found, and the majority Wednesday agreed,
that the statutory definition of what Nebraska was prohibiting also
applied to a procedure known as dilation and evacuation, or D &AMP; E,
which is used much more commonly for abortions after the first
trimester of pregnancy. In this procedure, the fetus is dismembered
during the abortion, meaning that a ``substantial portion'' of it
may be pulled into the vagina while the fetus is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion Wednesday, Breyer said the court had to review
the statute as it was written, and did not have authority to accept
the attorney general's invitation to make it narrower.
Consequently, Breyer said, all doctors using the D &AMP; E method
``must fear prosecution, conviction and imprisonment,'' making the
law an ``undue burden upon a woman's right to make an abortion
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   To that extent, the decision tracked the ruling last year by the
8th Circuit. Where the majority Wednesday went further was in its
insistence that even a more precisely written law needed to have an
exception to protect women's health, in addition to the provision
to save the life of the mother, which Nebraska's law and the other
states' laws have.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Breyer made it clear that the health exception had to
go beyond ``situations where the pregnancy  &UR; itself &LR;  creates a
threat to health.'' He said that although the medical testimony was
somewhat equivocal, the court accepted the view that ``a statute
that altogether forbids D &AMP; X creates a significant health risk''
and would be unconstitutional for that reason alone.
</P>
<P>
   In the second abortion decision Wednesday, the court ruled 6-3
that a Colorado law aimed at protecting abortion clinic patients
and doctors from harassment by protesters did not violate the
protesters' First Amendment rights. The decision, Hill vs.
Colorado, No. 98-1856, upheld a ruling by the Colorado Supreme
Court. Within 100 feet of the entrance to any health care facility,
no one may make an unwanted approach within 8 feet of another to
talk or pass out a leaflet.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens wrote the majority opinion, joined by and O'Connor,
Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer. Scalia, Thomas and Kennedy dissented.
Scalia and Kennedy read their impassioned dissenting opinions in
the courtroom Wednesday morning for more than half an hour, making
clear that this First Amendment debate was in many respects a proxy
for the court's ongoing abortion debate.

HOUSE APPROVES GOP PRESCRIPTION DRUG BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders on Wednesday pushed a Medicare
prescription drug bill through the House that has little chance of
becoming law because of opposition from President Clinton and the
health insurance companies it would rely on to make it work.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Republican members hailed the bill's passage,
217-214, as ``a red letter day'' for seniors who would benefit from
their plan to provide subsidies to insurance companies that
voluntarily offer drug coverage plans for Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, however, used words such as ``sham'' and
``fraud'', to describe the plan, which was written by Rep. Bill
Thomas, R-Calif., following an intense lobbying campaign by
pharmaceutical companies designed to prevent a more generous but
more costly Democratic substitute from reaching the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic members stormed out of the House Wednesday when
Republicans adopted a rule that made the Thomas proposal the only
bill in order for consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the rain under yellow and red umbrellas that read
``shame,'' the Democrats accused Republicans of trying to pull a
``hoax'' on the American people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are going to allow debate on only one opinion,''
said Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Texas. ``We will talk about nothing else
because they are afraid ... that too many of their Republicans may
side with too many of the Democrats in putting a real prescription
drug plan under Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders did lose 10 of their own on the final vote,
which was twice as many as they gained from the Democratic ranks.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to stall passage of the GOP measure, the Democrats
employed a number of parliamentary maneuvers in addition to their
walkout that delayed the final vote until late Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans accused them of playing election-year politics with
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let them stall, let them dilly-dally,'' said Rep. Deborah
Pryce, R-Ohio. ``Americans can see through it.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also weighed in at a White House news
conference, threatening a veto if the GOP bill manages to pass the
Senate in its present form.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to consider a different drug benefit bill
in the coming weeks, and may allow some debate on a Democratic
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Calling it ``an empty promise'' to seniors who struggle to pay
the high cost of prescriptions, Clinton said the Thomas bill ``puts
special interests above the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a private insurance plan that many seniors and people
with disabilities simply won't be able to afford. Insurers
themselves say the Republican plan won't work,'' Clinton said,
citing criticism of the proposal from the insurance industry, which
has labeled it ``unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The president accused Republicans of taking up the banner of
prescription drug benefits only because their narrow six-seat
majority hold on Congress is in danger in this fall's elections.
The vote among seniors could determine the outcome in several key
races.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders stood in the way of attempts last year by
Democrats to force a vote on the issue. But during last summer's
congressional recess, while trying to sell a tax cut plan, they
found that most Americans put a higher priority on providing a drug
benefit for low-income seniors and paying down the debt than
receiving a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Republicans have been pushing debt reduction as a
priority issue and floating ``public-private'' proposals that call
on insurance companies to voluntarily provide affordable drug
benefit plans for seniors. In return, companies would receive a
subsidy paid out of a Medicare funds to help them offset the rising
costs of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Thomas plan, Medicare beneficiaries would have to pay
the insurance premiums, depending on the kind of coverage provided.
The companies would be free to set the premiums at different levels
for different parts of the country. But they would be encouraged to
provide at least two coverage choices. Thomas predicted that
premiums would average $35 to $40 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the bill, however, world force pharmaceutical
companies to reduce the price of drugs sold to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The Thomas plan would cost an estimated $40 billion over five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Thomas plan and the Democratic alternative would pay on
average up to 50 percent of annual drug costs for seniors. But the
Republican measure would force them to spend more out-of-pocket
than the Democratic proposal, which would cost an estimated $100
billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   For catastrophic or terminal illnesses, the Thomas bill would
pay all drug costs above $6,000 a year, while the Democratic
proposal would assume all costs above $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic plan, which would be administered directly
through the Medicare program with the help of insurance companies,
would also establish a basic set of guaranteed benefits and costs
that would be uniform throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, attacked the
Democratic proposal as a ``one-size-fits-all'' bureaucratic
approach to curbing high drug costs for Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll offer seniors only a single government-run plan and
seniors will have to take it or leave it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But one of his Texas colleagues, Democrat Gene Green, accused
Republicans of trying to promote ``a gimmick'' that appears to
provide help for seniors but really doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be putting the benefit in the hands of senior
citizens and not insurance companies,'' Green said.

CLINTON JUMPS TO GORE'S DEFENSE, SLAMS `BOGUS' SCANDALS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton rejected assertions Wednesday
that his administration has been plagued by scandals, calling them
``bogus'' and saying the myriad investigations should not taint
Democratic candidate Al Gore's bid for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping to his vice president's defense, Clinton expressed
doubts that voters would penalize Gore for the legal problems that
have dogged the president, his wife, aides, Cabinet members and the
Democratic Party since he took office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word `scandal' has been thrown around here like a clanging
teapot for seven years,'' Clinton said angrily, waving his arms
during a White House news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these ... so-called `scandals' were bogus,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Whitewater thing was bogus from day one,'' Clinton said,
referring to the five-year investigation _ still going on _ into
Arkansas business dealings in which he and first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had nothing to do with the official conduct of the
administration anyway,'' the president said testily.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pointed out that former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy
was acquitted on charges of accepting illegal gifts from
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cisneros thing was a tempest in a teapot, totally
overdone,'' Clinton said, referring to the case in which former
Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros pleaded guilty to lying about
payments he made to a woman with whom he was having an affair while
mayor of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not mention investigations that yielded no
prosecutions against Labor Secretary Alexis Herman or Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt. Likewise, Clinton did not mention his
efforts to cover up his sexual misbehavior at the White House or
how it led to his impeachment and almost ended his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The president said Gore has been implicated only in ``this
campaign finance thing,'' referring to fund-raising abuses in 1996
that so far have resulted in prosecutions against 21 people
associated with the administration and the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   A top Justice Department prosecutor early this month recommended
that Attorney General Janet Reno appoint a special counsel to
examine what role Gore played in the fund-raising and whether he
lied under oath when questioned by investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has rejected earlier recommendations that she seek an
independent investigation and has not acted on this latest one.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton dismissed assertions that Gore's recent drop in public
opinion surveys was linked to the specter raised by the possibility
of a deeper investigation into 1996 fund-raising excesses. One
recent poll showed Gore trailing Republican George W. Bush by 13
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of volatility in these polls,'' the
president said during his hourlong news conference in the East Room
of the White House. ``My best judgment is that people are still
trying to figure out what they're going to do, and sooner or later
they will.''
</P>
<P>
   When they do, voters will like what they see of Gore's record
and vision for the future, Clinton said. ``It's still more likely
than not that he will win.''

HOUSE AGREES TO REPUBLICANS' PRESCRIPTION PLAN FOR ELDERLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House passed a bill Wednesday offering
prescription drug benefits to 39 million elderly and disabled
people on Medicare, but only after a day of pitched battle in which
frustrated Democrats walked off the House floor at one point.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was passed by a vote of 217-214, with five Democrats
voting for the measure and 10 Republicans voting against it. Though
the bill would expand Medicare more than any other measure passed
in the 35-year history of the program by offering coverage for drug
costs to all beneficiaries, it now goes to the Senate, where its
fate is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote came at the end of a day of high drama and
political high jinks as each party tried to outdo the other in
proving its zealous commitment to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they championed a major extension of Medicare coverage,
Republicans found themselves on the defensive throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing the Republican bill as a sham, a hoax, bad medicine
and a risky scheme that would ``privatize'' Medicare, the
Democratic minority used a variety of parliamentary and procedural
tactics to delay the work of the House. The Democrats also
expressed their frustration at being unable to get a full debate on
their proposal to establish much more extensive drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans shot back that the Democrats were throwing temper
tantrums and were engaged in political grandstanding, stunts and
shenanigans to scare the elderly and win votes in this fall's
elections.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois said, ``Democrats are
standing in the way of progress.'' President Clinton threatened to
veto the House Republican bill, which he denounced as an empty
promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts special interests above the public interest,'' Clinton
said at a White House news conference Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican bill, the government would pay subsidies to
insurance companies to encourage them to offer a product that does
not now exist: insurance policies covering drug costs of the
elderly and disabled. The policies would not cover any other
medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats strongly support Medicare drug benefits, but want a
larger role for the government and a smaller role for the insurance
industry. Under the Democratic bill, premiums and benefits would be
the same for virtually all beneficiaries in all parts of the
country. Under the Republican plan, the government would describe a
model or standard policy, but premiums, benefits and co-payments
could vary from one private drug plan to another, so long as the
overall value was equivalent to that of the model policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic plan appears to be more generous than the
Republicans' standard policy. Monthly premiums would be $25,
compared with $37, there would be no deductible and the
beneficiary's maximum out-of-pocket costs would be $4,000 a year,
compared with $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, Medicare generally does not cover drug costs
for people outside the hospital. One-third of Medicare
beneficiaries have no insurance to help pay such costs.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans won a majority of the elderly vote in elections for
the House two years ago, and Democrats see the prescription drug
issue as an opportunity to regain their advantage with the elderly,
and their majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., criticized the Republican measure,
saying: ``This bill does not provide prescription drug coverage to
senior citizens. It provides political cover for Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate last week rejected the Democratic approach to
Medicare drug benefits when it came up suddenly and unexpectedly on
the floor. The Senate Finance Committee is working on drug
legislation and may vote on it soon.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of the House Rules Committee at 2:30 a.m.
Wednesday, Republicans set highly restrictive rules for floor
debate later in the day. The rules were narrowly approved in the
full House on a largely party-line vote of 216-213.
</P>
<P>
   The rules allowed the Democrats only 10 minutes at the end of
the day to propose an alternative to the House Republican bill.
Democrats wanted to offer a measure costing $100 billion over five
years, but House Republican leaders insisted that the Democrats
could not offer anything costing more than $40 billion, the cost of
the Republican bill.
</P>
<P>
   To show their displeasure, Democrats forced the House to take
nine roll-call votes before the House even began debating the
substance of the Republican bill.
</P>
<P>
   Just before final passage of the Republican bill, the House
Wednesday night rejected a scaled-down version of President
Clinton's plan to offer drug benefits through Medicare. The vote on
the measure, which came in under the $40 billion limit set in the
rules, was 222-204.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of the day's political in-fighting, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the
Republican whip, said, ``The Democrats have been planning this
circus for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Deborah Pryce, R-Ohio, said: ``The Democrats are throwing a
temper tantrum to divert attention from the merits of our bill. In
walking out of the House today, they walked out on America's
seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   After marching out, Democrats held a news conference on the east
steps of the Capitol, then returned to the House floor a half-hour
later.
</P>
<P>
   The AARP, formerly known as the American Association of Retired
Persons, did not endorse or oppose either bill.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Congress, Horace Deets, the group's executive
director, said, ``We are pleased that both the House Republican and
Democratic bills include a voluntary prescription drug benefit in
Medicare _ a benefit to which every Medicare beneficiary is
entitled.'' But Deets expressed concern that ``many beneficiaries
may elect not to participate'' in the Republican plan. People with
low drug costs may not view it as a ``good buy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Senior Citizens Law Center, which represents many
Medicare recipients, opposed the House Republican bill, saying
subsidies would be ``grossly inadequate'' for many of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House Republican plan, a widow with income of $13,000
a year and drug expenses of $4,800 a year would have to spend
nearly one-third of her income on drugs and insurance if she bought
the standard coverage. She would have to pay $4,194, or 87 percent
of her drug costs, out of her own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   In this example, the widow would pay $37 a month, or $444 a
year, in premiums, plus the $250 deductible and half of the next
$2,100 in drug expenses, or $1,050. The insurance policy would pay
the other half. The beneficiary would have to pay the remainder of
her drug expenses, $2,450.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said their bill was superior to the Democrats'
because it would let elderly people buy policies tailored to their
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the
Ways and Means Committee, said: ``Democrats offer no choice to
seniors. They offer only a single government-run plan. Seniors will
have to take it or leave it.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Rick Lazio, R-New York, said: ``Our bill will improve
the lives of millions of Americans. It relies on a public-private
partnership model that has proven successful in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader,
said: ``Instead of making prescriptions more affordable for all
seniors, the Republican bill hands a huge subsidy to the insurance
industry. Republicans are forcing seniors to deal with private
insurance companies, which have said they will not offer
prescription coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats repeatedly quoted Charles Kahn III, president of the
Health Insurance Association of America, who has said his members
are not interested in selling drug insurance of the type envisioned
in the House Republican bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., said the Republican bill ``throws
money at special interests and allows pharmaceutical companies to
continue price-gouging.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans countered that their bill, by pooling the
purchasing power of older Americans, would allow them to get
discounts of 25 percent off retail drug prices.

AT FUND-RAISER, GORE SAYS MONEY TALKS;   ANTI-GUN ADS TIMED FOR GOP

   THE DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   AT FUND-RAISER, GORE SAYS MONEY TALKS
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the influence of money in politics have long
complained that the only real way to get a place at the table is to
buy one, and Vice President Al Gore seemed to edge up on a similar
assessment this week in his remarks to a mostly black crowd of
first- and second-generation immigrants from Africa at a
$1,000-per-person fund-raiser in Washington. Noting that the event
raised $350,000 for the Democratic National Committee, Gore told
the audience, ``That is a sign that this group has really entered a
brand new relationship to the national politics of our country.''
He added that ``as Irish-Americans have been able to focus the
attention of our policy makers,'' so, too, would the audience on
Tuesday night be able ``to play its proper role in helping to focus
the attention of our country on issues in Nigeria or Ethiopia or
Ghana or Cameroon or South Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   THE CONVENTIONS
</P>
<P>
   ANTI-GUN ADS TIMED FOR GOP CONVENTION
</P>
<P>
   A national gun control organization that has displayed thousands
of gunshot victims' shoes around the country is planning an
advertising blitz and special shows of shoes during the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia. The organization, Silent
March, says its advertisements against guns will appear on 100 city
buses and 50 subway trains from July 31 through Aug. 3, though
convention managers currently have no plans to make an issue of gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``These advertisements are a wake-up call to the Republican
Party,'' Ellen Freudenheim, a co-founder and director of Silent
March, said on Tuesday in announcing the group's plans.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEBATES
</P>
<P>
   BUSH MULLS DEBATE PRINCIPLES
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush says politics just might be more important
than principle in deciding whether to back bids by Ralph Nader and
Patrick J. Buchanan to be allowed in this fall's presidential
debates. ``I don't know,'' Bush said on Tuesday when asked if he
favored letting Nader, the Green Party nominee, and Buchanan, the
probable Reform Party nominee, join him and Vice President Al Gore
on the debate stage. ``I haven't figured out the impact yet.'' Was
he saying he would be willing to let them in only if he concluded
that it would help his own White House bid? ``I am trying to win,
aren't I?'' he replied, flashing a big grin. The Commission on
Presidential Debates recommended last week that the debates be open
only to candidates receiving the backing of at least 15 percent of
voters in national polls.

SPORTS COLUMN: FROWNING ON BRAVES' NEW FACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York Mets fans greet the dawn of a new day
Thursday morning with a rush of anticipation of a big showdown.
They open a four-game series with the Atlanta Braves in what can
safely be called the first critical series of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of important games coming up,'' Mike Piazza
said Wednesday. ``We're not going to put a do-or-die perspective on
this series, but this is a huge series.''
</P>
<P>
   More than the New York Yankees, more than any other National
League team, Atlanta is a franchise that has defined the Mets in
recent years; it is the franchise against which the Mets measure
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But this time the terms of the competition are different. This
time the competition has a face, a name, a personality. The new
face of the Atlanta Braves belongs to John Rocker, the relief
pitcher whose anti-gay, anti-ethnic anti-New York comments in a
magazine article last year earned him a fine and suspension, as
well as a notoriety that has made him something of a pariah.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker is a product of the dot.com age of information, in which
every word, every image, is captured by a widening range of news
media. Devoured.
</P>
<P>
   In the long, meandering history of the Braves _ from Boston to
Milwaukee to Atlanta _ the face of the franchise has often been a
player: Warren Spahn, the Hall of Fame pitcher; Hank Aaron, the
career home run leader. During the last decade the face of Atlanta
has been its three All-Star pitchers: Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and
John Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   Then John Rocker decided to go off on his own and grab the
marquee billing: like Gladys Knight and the Pips, or Diana Ross and
the Supremes, it's now John Rocker and the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was stunning last season and suffocated the Mets. Near
the end of National League Championship Series the Mets began to
reach Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Harris said he believed that Rocker lost more that a few
games with his statements. He lost part of that mantle of a
closer's invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he feels Rocker may have lost some face. ``We used
to look at him: `Man, here comes Rocker. This guy, he's tough to
hit.' Then next thing you know, he comes out with something like
this. You say, `Aw man, this guy is silly. He doesn't know what
he's talking about.' He's lost some respect; he's lost a lot of
points out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw I was going to face John Rocker, I'm like, this
dude here is pretty bad. I've really got to let him make a mistake
before you can beat him. Now you're like, `forget it,' at the
plate. `I'm going to try to kill this guy.' I still feel like what
he said _ calling his teammate a monkey _ wasn't good.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Rocker is dragging his teammates into a fray they didn't
want to be in. The team and Rocker will be protected like a
visiting premier or minister during their four-day stay in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a distraction for that team,'' Harris said. ``You
can tell by the comments his teammates make from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta with Rocker has become like a traveling medicine show,
with a beefed-up news media asking the same questions, dredging up
the same history. Rocker, attempting to hold true to character, is
still running to the mound, still pumping his fists and assuming
the bravado of the conqueror.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is how will this affect the standings. Will the
Mets lose or gain from Atlanta's distraction?
</P>
<P>
   The Rocker of this season is hardly the Rocker of old. He has 12
saves, but his control has been so inconsistent _ why isn't that
surprising _ that he was sent down to the minors earlier this month
and was brought up after a brief stay. He'll be tested as never
before during Atlanta's four games in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be exciting baseball, like a playoff
atmosphere,'' said Piazza, the Mets catcher and top hitter.
``There's going to be a lot of reaction. But we're not going to go
into this series and lose our focus on baseball. We can't worry
about one guy. You got Greg Maddux, you got Tom Glavine, Andruw
Jones, Chipper Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, unlike Harris, said he doesn't this think more or less
of Rocker as a player because of what he said as a civilian. ``I
always try to humanize my opponents,'' Piazza said. ``I've never
built anybody up, I don't build up these huge confrontation because
I get too wired.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, frustrated by Atlanta for the last three seasons, must
overcome history to overcome Atlanta. Atlanta's problem is much
more deep seated. John Rocker's Braves not only need a new
personality they desperately need a face lift.

 &HT;    Archbishop released uninjured
 &HT;    By Stephen Scheibal and Kim Sue Lia Perkes

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ An armed San Antonio man fearing
deportation released one of Texas' top Catholic Church officials
Wednesday evening, ending nearly nine hours of a police standoff
and community vigils.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Patrick Flores, 70, head of the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of San Antonio, was reportedly uninjured after he was
released around 7 p.m. from his office by Nelson Antonio Escolero,
40, an immigrant from El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   Escolero took Flores and his long-time secretary, Myrtle
Sanchez, 74, hostage around 10:30 a.m. Wednesday at the archdiocese
chancery, just northwest of downtown. Sanchez, who has worked with
Flores for about 30 years, was released unharmed within three
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Escolero, a legal resident of the United States, was upset over
his possible deportation for driving with a suspended license,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, after authorities faxed Escolero immigration status
papers he had requested, he allowed Flores to go free, San Antonio
police chief Al Philippus said, then placed a grenade-like device
on a table and walked out. Escolero was taken away in handcuffs and
was being held Wednesday night on two counts of aggravated
kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Police later said the device was a fake grenade.
</P>
<P>
   Previous criminal convictions for Escolero, also known as Carlos
Cruz, were nonviolent: two charges of possession of marijuana,
burglary of a vehicle, unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The chief said the archbishop was tired but relieved the
situation had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Philippus said Escolero pushed Flores down early in the day, the
only physical contact between the two. Flores was taken to Christus
San Rosa Health Care hospital to be checked for possible back
problems, but otherwise seemed fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're very pleased with the outcome of this,''
Philippus said. ``God came down and really smiled on us and wrapped
his arms around the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Escolero, who has a wife and three children in San Antonio,
reportedly met Flores on the ground floor of the San Antonio
Archdiocese Chancery Wednesday morning and accompanied the
archbishop to his third-floor office. During various phone calls
during the standoff, he railed to authorities about his immigration
problems, fears of deportation, and current unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   During the negotiations, Escolero also raged about other
different subjects, including the return of Elian Gonzales to Cuba.
During negotiations, police brought Escolero's wife and at least
one of his children to the chancery, where officers passed messages
back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, who was not available for comment Wednesday evening,
remained calm throughout the ordeal and played a key role in his
own release, Philippus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty smooth today,'' Philippus said of Flores.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, who has headed the 23-county San Antonio archdiocese
since 1979, is the only archbishop in Texas. He is also head of the
Catholic Church's Texas province and oversees all the dioceses in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jimmy Drennan, who spoke on behalf of the archdiocese,
said the archbishop was in good condition physically and
emotionally late Wednesday. Drennan, pastor at St. Paul's Catholic
Church in San Antonio and a former San Antonio police officer, rode
to the hospital with Flores.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed a lot of concern for the man and said his faith in
prayer and God and his love for life got him through it,'' Drennan
said. ``He saw himself as a pastoral agent even to him
(Escolero).''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Rosa hospital administrator Cary Fox said the archbishop
would remain at the hospital overnight for observation. He was
undergoing a number of tests Wednesday night to determine his
condition.
</P>
<P>
   A group of San Antonio police officers were questioning Flores
about the day's events.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, Escolero simply wanted to bring
attention to his concerns, officials said, and chose Flores because
of the archbishop's long support of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he got a lot of attention today,'' Philippus said.
</P>
<P>
   Philippus said police did not make any guarantees to Escolero.
Escolero and his family were forced to leave their San Antonio home
on Elvira Street about a year ago when they were unable to pay
their property taxes, said a former neighbor who asked that her
name not be used. Other neighbors said Escolero rarely socialized
with them and often worked on cars in his driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the standoff, police evacuated the chancery of its
roughly 100 employees and allowed them to retrieve cars from the
parking lot about five at a time. But many of the archdiocese
employees went across the street and began a vigil on the
residential lawns facing the chancery, a light brick building with
two red columns sitting atop a grassy hill several hundred yards
from the street. Others left their keys in the building and could
not get back into their cars.
</P>
<P>
   About a half dozen people began reciting the rosary toward the
building. The crowd on the lawns swelled over the afternoon, with
concerned Catholics and other area residents.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Monod, director of the archdiocesan Office of Social
Concerns, said the crowds on the lawns reflected the love that
Flores, who faces mandatory retirement in two years at age 72, has
in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just reaches out to people,'' Monod said. ``He always wants
to help people whenever he can.''
</P>
<P>
   That openness may have helped cause the crisis. Several
employees described Flores' open-door policy in which people
sometimes could literally walk off the street and knock on his door
unquestioned. That policy has led to some debate in the past, said
David Garza, rector of the San Fernando Cathedral in San Antonio
and a long-time friend of Flores.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's extremely accessible, which is something people have
criticized him for,'' Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   Flores has devoted his ministry to helping the poor,
particularly reaching out to Latin American refugees, immigrants
and Americans of Mexican heritage. The archdiocese freely welcomes
illegal immigrants, many of whom make San Antonio their first stop
after crossing the southern Mexico-Texas border.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio churches help them with food, water, and clothes.
Some move on to other cities, but many decide to stay because of
the large Hispanic culture and the array of ministries to help them
get on their feet offered through the archdiocese and its churches.
In many ways, the archdiocese is an international sea of Latinos _
helping people from El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, and a host of
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   At the San Fernando Cathedral, the archbishop's home church,
about 175 parishioners erupted with shouts of joy shortly after the
7 p.m. Mass began.
</P>
<P>
   Archdiocesan officials received word about two minutes into the
service that the archbishop had been released unharmed. For them
the release was a statement on the power of prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it with God's help,'' said church member Janie Cauazos.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day Wednesday, hundreds of people visited the
cathedral for prayer, church officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Other churches in the area also scheduled special prayer
services Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Following the service at the cathedral, parishioners once again
began clapping, cheering, hugging and crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the Lord would take care of him,'' said worshipper
Eloise Cortez. ``All of San Antonio and the U.S. and world were
praying for him.''

HOUSE DEMOCRATS LOOK TO FILMS FOR INSPIRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the House minority
leader, has an unusual motivational tool for his rank and file: the
magic of the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Girding for Wednesday's showdown on the House floor over a
Republican-sponsored bill to expand Medicare coverage to include
prescription drugs, Gephardt showed Democrats clips this week from
the films ``Gladiator'' and ``Apollo 13'' to rouse his troops to
fight together against the Republican legislation. Ultimately,
however, the Republicans prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting Tuesday of the 211 House Democrats, Gephardt dimmed
the lights in a Capitol conference room and rolled a scene from
``Gladiator'' in which a band of warriors led by the film's hero,
played by Russell Crowe, prepares to battle better-armed gladiators
in the Colosseum. (Subtext: The House Democrats are the underdogs;
the Republicans are the evil gladiators, Democratic aides said.)
</P>
<P>
   In the part of the film viewed by the Democrats, Maximus, the
hero, implores his men to fight with him and says, ``Whatever comes
out of these gates, we have a better chance of survival if we stick
together.'' When the underdogs win, the room full of Democrats
burst in wild cheers and applause, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Gephardt showed Democrats a clip from ``Apollo 13''
that includes the line, ``Failure is not an option.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Gephardt has used movie clips to rev
up the minority. Last August, he showed Democrats a clip from
``Braveheart'' before the summer recess as part of Democrats'
strategy to fight for more teachers. They won that fight, though
their ``Gladiator''-inspired effort against the Republicans'
Medicare legislation was much more of an uphill battle.

PEACE PROPONENTS URGE CLINTON TO DELAY ANTI-MISSILE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A group of more than 40 U.S. scholars on China and
former diplomats is urging President Clinton to delay a decision on
whether to build a national missile defense, arguing that the
proposed system may do more harm than good to American economic and
military interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that a precipitous decision to deploy would
adversely affect U.S. relations with China,'' the group says in a
letter to be issued on Thursday, ``by unnecessarily increasing
tensions between the two countries and provoking a series of
negative steps by China that would undermine American security.''
</P>
<P>
   Those signing the letter, which was to be delivered to the White
House, include an ambassador to China under President Ronald Reagan
as well as China specialists from around the country. Signatures
were gathered by the Council for a Livable World, a private group
in Washington that lobbies for nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Strong political momentum has gathered for construction of a
limited missile defense system intended to protect against a
missile attacks from rogue states like North Korea or Iraq. Clinton
is supposed to decide this summer, after a key test on July 7,
whether to begin construction of radars in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   But many foreign policy experts, scientists and former security
officials have questioned the plan on technical or strategic
grounds, and it has been strongly opposed by Russia, China and even
American allies in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that the plan will raise the stakes in the arms
race by stimulating the Chinese and others to make more missiles,''
said one signer of the letter, Arthur Hummel Jr., who was
ambassador to China from 1981 to 1985. ``Second, I have grave
doubts about whether it will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a silmilar plea for delaying the
anti-missile program came from a group of former top officials,
including retired Gen. John Shalikashvili, who was chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff; former Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, who had
served as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee; and
William Perry, a former defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed system, the first stage of which involves 100
missile interceptors based in Alaska, would violate the
Antiballistic Missile Treaty signed with the Soviet Union in 1972.
The administration has tried, without success, to persuade Russia
to agree to treaty revisions, arguing that limited defenses would
not undermine the value of Russia's large nuclear forces.
</P>
<P>
   But China's objections run deeper. Officials here say that in a
showdown with the United States, the deterrent effect of China's
small nuclear force, which includes perhaps 20 long-range missiles,
would be vitiated by the American plan. Officials warn that China
will be forced to build far more missiles or develop decoy
measures, and say the U.S. plan will set off a global arms race.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials respond that China plans to improve its missile
forces anyway, and that the proposed defenses are not intended to
offset Chinese power.

WHO WILL BLINK FIRST, THE YANKS OR CUBS?
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ If the Sammy Sosa deal is going to be finished,
somebody is going to have to give it a good shove. Maybe that will
be George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, who is eager
to make a big deal. Maybe it will be the Cubs, faced with the
possibility that the Yankees' current offer might be the best they
can get.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs executives are waiting for the Yankees to cave in to their
demands. Yankee executives are weighing the huge cost, in prospects
and dollars, of acquiring Sosa, and are exploring other modest
improvements, like trading for Oakland's John Jaha or San Diego's
Ed Sprague. The stalemate continues.
</P>
<P>
   According to a person with knowledge of the trade talks, this is
the Yankees' current four-player offer: the Cubs will receive the
Double-A outfielder Jackson Melian, the Triple-A pitcher Jake
Westbrook, outfielder Ricky Ledee and a choice of two minor league
infielders _ either Alfonso Soriano, who is one of the Yankees' top
prospects, or D'Angelo Jimenez, a touted infielder who has been out
all year after breaking a bone in his neck in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs want more; they want five players. They want Melian,
Ledee, Westbrook and both Soriano and Jimenez, or one of those two
and pitcher Alex Graman, a 22-year-old left-hander with Single-A
Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been pretty much there all week, and they are at an
impasse,'' said a person with knowledge of the talks. ``But sides
appear to be pretty well entrenched. Nothing has changed these last
couple of days. There has been no progress. It doesn't look like
there's going to be any change.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, is said to be very
reluctant to surrender such a significant package of prospects,
knowing that the cost will be double edged. The Yankees will have
to give Sosa a four- or five-year extension for something in the
range of $17 million to $20 million a year, and in addition, the
Yankees would suffer for all the low-priced talent they would give
away. Soriano, Melian, Westbrook and the others could serve the
Yankees for the next half-decade for bargain basement salaries, and
the Yankees might have to acquire older, more expensive players
instead.
</P>
<P>
   So the Yankees are looking at other ways to improve and keep
their prospects. They know they need pitching, like Francisco
Cordova or Jose Silva of the Pirates, or the Rangers' Esteban
Loaiza, with Ramiro Mendoza and Roger Clemens currently on the
disabled list and little talent ready for the major leagues at
Triple-A Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have had fruitless talks with the Baltimore Orioles
about B.J. Surhoff so far. The Orioles have asked for Ledee and
Melian, but the Yankees have had more promising discussions with
the Athletics about the 34-year-old Jaha and with the Padres about
Sprague, 32.
</P>
<P>
   Jaha hit 35 homers for Oakland last year, but he has been
battling injuries this season and only recently has returned to the
lineup, batting .178 with 1 homer in 26 games before last night.
Jaha is adept at working the count and drawing walks. Even with his
low batting average, he has accumulated a .429 on-base percentage,
and is averaging 4.72 pitches per plate appearance, at a time when
3.7 pitches per plate appearance is considered average.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland, which is loaded with first base/designated hitter types
like Jaha, has talked with the Boston Red Sox about the slugger as
well. The Yankees could probably get Jaha for a good, but not
great, prospect or a serviceable relief pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague was hitting .274 with 10 homers in 117 at-bats before
last night's game for the Padres, who have been devastated by
injuries and are looking to trade the veterans for young players.
He hit 22 homers last year, and has 8 homers in 74 at-bats this
year against left-handed pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees could use Jaha or Sprague against lefties, mix one
of them in at first base and DH, the way they wanted to do with Jim
Leyritz before it became clear that Leyritz's diminished bat speed
rendered him ineffective early in the season. The Yankees would
like to acquire Jaha or Sprague, regardless of whether they make
the Sosa deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' losses keep mounting, however: 26 defeats in the
last 41 games, a 37-35 record over all. ``The only thing that's
helping us,'' David Cone said after Tuesday's 7-6 defeat, ``is that
there is consistent mediocrity in the division. That's what is
keeping us in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, executives say, is angrily pressuring Cashman to
make a big deal. The Cubs, on the other hand, do not appear to have
much of a market for Sosa, with few teams willing to dump a
truckload of prospects and then have enough money to negotiate a
new deal with Sosa, who can veto any trade possibility.
</P>

BOY SCOUTS CAN BAR GAY MEN FROM BEING TROOP LEADERS, HIGH COURT
RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (CHANGES tense in lede; DELETES ``Jaycees'' from 9th graf)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday by a 5-4 vote
that the Boy Scouts have a constitutional right to exclude gay
members because opposition to homosexuality is part of the
organization's ``expressive message.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision overturned a ruling last year by the New Jersey
Supreme Court that applied the state's law against discrimination
in public accommodations to require a New Jersey troop to readmit a
lifelong member and assistant scoutmaster, James Dale, whom it had
dismissed after learning he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court Wednesday, Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist said that the court intended neither to approve nor
disapprove the Boy Scouts' view of homosexuality, but that the
First Amendment's protection for freedom of association meant that
the state could not compel the 6.2-million member organization ``to
accept members where such acceptance would derogate from the
organization's expressive message.''
</P>
<P>
   He said ``Dale's presence in the Boy Scouts would, at the very
least, force the organization to send a message, both to the youth
members and the world, that the Boy Scouts accepts homosexual
conduct as a legitimate form of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The four dissenters did not object to the general principle that
an organization cannot be forced to adopt or incorporate an
unwanted message _ a principle the court applied unanimously five
years ago in upholding the right of the Boston St. Patrick's Day
parade organizers to exclude a group that sought to march under a
banner of Irish gay pride.
</P>
<P>
   But the dissenters objected strenuously to that principle's
application in this case, because they said the majority had done
little more than accept at face value the Boy Scouts' assertion of
the central importance of its opposition to homosexuality. But
except in briefs filed in this and other cases defending their
membership policy, the Boy Scouts had never made the ``clear,
unequivocal statement necessary to prevail'' on a claim that
homosexuality was fundamentally incompatible with the
organization's mission, the dissenters said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's majority opinion was joined by Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
Justice John Paul Stevens filed the main dissenting opinion, joined
by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer and David H.
Souter, who also filed a dissenting opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In permitting the Boy Scouts' First Amendment interests to trump
New Jersey's anti-discrimination law, the majority relied heavily
on its 1995 St. Patrick's Day parade case, in which the gay
marchers had claimed the protection of a Massachusetts civil rights
law. Both that decision and the ruling Wednesday indicated that the
court would continue to weigh on a case-by-case basis the competing
claims of a private organization's right to exclude unwanted
participation and a public policy against discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The majority Wednesday drew a distinction between this decision
and a trio of Supreme Court rulings from the 1980s rejecting the
arguments of all-male organizations, including the Rotary Club,
that they had a First Amendment right to exclude women.
</P>
<P>
   The court held in those cases that because the exclusion of
women was not part of the shared goal or expressive message of
those organizations, the application of state civil rights laws to
require the admission of women did not place an unconstitutional
burden on the members' right of association.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the court's free association cases have dealt with
exclusion by private organizations on the basis of race, that
analysis would presumably permit a white supremacy group to exclude
blacks if racial exclusion was an inherent part of the group's
identity and message.

</P>
<P>
   In his opinion, Boy Scouts of America vs. Dale, No. 99-699,
Rehnquist quoted from various Boy Scouts publications and
explanations of the policy, noting that although the terms
``morally straight'' and ``clean'' in the Scout Oath and Law ``are
by no means self-defining,'' Boy Scouts officials interpreted them
as statements of opposition to homosexuality. ``We accept the Boy
Scouts' assertion'' and ``need not inquire further,'' the chief
justice said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Harlow, deputy legal director of the Lambda Legal Defense
Fund in New York, said Wednesday the Boy Scouts had won only a
``hollow, pyrrhic victory'' because in order to win the case, it
had to demonstrate to the court's satisfaction the centrality of
its opposition to homosexuality. ``The Boy Scouts have fought long
and hard for something that has marginalized their institution,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Wolfson, another lawyer with the Lambda organization, who
represented Dale before the court, said the decision ``requires you
to declare yourself an institution with an anti-gay message, and we
don't think there are many organizations in this day and age
willing to declare themselves as that.''
</P>
<P>
   In his dissenting opinion, Stevens noted several newspaper
articles from the past few weeks that described a gay pride day at
the Central Intelligence Agency, a New England boarding school's
acceptance of openly gay couples as dormitory parents, and the
extension of benefits to gay partners by the major automobile
makers. ``The past month alone has witnessed some remarkable
changes in attitudes about homosexuals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist responded to that observation. ``Indeed, it appears
that homosexuality has gained greater societal acceptance,'' he
said. ``But this is scarcely an argument for denying First
Amendment protection to those who refuse to accept these views.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement posted on its web site, the Boy Scouts said that
as a private organization, it ``must have the right to establish
its own standards of membership if it is to continue to instill the
values of the Scout Oath and Law in boys.'' The statement
continued: ``Thanks to our legal victories, our standards of
membership have been sustained. We believe an avowed homosexual is
not a role model for the values espoused in the Scout Oath and
Law.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on the distinctions between this case and the earlier
rulings on all-male clubs, the chief justice said that to claim the
First Amendment's protection, ``a group must engage in some form of
expression, whether it be public or private.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said in dissent that the majority's distinction was
unpersuasive because just as the all-male clubs had not made the
exclusion of women a central goal, ``there is no shared goal or
collective effort to foster a belief about homosexuality'' in the
Boy Scouts, ``let alone one that is significantly burdened by
admitting homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens continued: ``The only apparent explanation for the
majority's holding, then, is that homosexuals are simply so
different from the rest of society that their presence alone _
unlike any other individual's _ should be singled out for special
First Amendment treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The civic and cultural standing of the Boy Scouts, the
``sincerity'' of which the majority opinion noted in several
places, may have had more to do with the outcome of the case
thanDale's sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The case attracted dozens of briefs, a number depicting this
legal battle _ which the Boy Scouts have been waging in courts
around the country for 20 years _ as the cutting edge of the
current culture wars.
</P>
<P>
   Dale was an Eagle Scout and popular member and then assistant
leader of the troop he had joined at the age of 8 when, 12 years
later, he was ejected after his picture appeared in a New Jersey
newspaper article about a gay student conference at Rutgers, where
he was co-president of the gay and lesbian students' organization.
He brought suit under a New Jersey law that prohibits
discrimination in places of public accommodation. Because the New
Jersey Supreme Court found as a matter of state law that the Boy
Scouts fit the definition of a public accommodation, rather than a
purely private organization, that aspect of the case was not open
to the justices' re-examination.

CONGRESS MOVES TOWARD DISLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR NONPROFIT GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress moved decisively on Wednesday toward
enacting the first major change in the nation's campaign finance
law since 1979, closing a loophole through which millions of
dollars have secretly flowed. President Clinton strongly supports
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday morning, the House overwhelmingly approved
bipartisan legislation to require a growing number of shadowy
tax-exempt groups that raise and spend money on political advocacy
to disclose their activities and donors. The vote was 385-39.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republican leaders who had fought the measure conceded
that the Senate would approve the House bill. After a brief debate
Wednesday night, a final Senate vote was scheduled for Thursday.
The outcome is not in doubt. Three weeks ago, the Senate passed
virtually the same measure, 57-42. ``This will pass
overwhelmingly,'' said one senior Senate Republican aide.
</P>
<P>
   The events of the last 24 hours were a major victory for Sen.
John McCain, R.-Ariz, who made overhauling campaign finance law a
centerpiece of his failed presidential bid this year, and his
bipartisan allies in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But their bill to constrain the undisclosed political activities
of nonprofit groups is far less comprehensive than the legislation
to overhaul the election laws that McCain has tried to push through
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote represented a stern rebuke to House and Senate
Republican leaders who had tried to kill the measure by offering a
much broader bill, only to see that effort backfire. By clamping
down only on the tax-exempt groups, the leaders hope to dilute
support for more extensive measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly a remarkable first step, but I don't think
anyone is expecting a major bill beyond it this year,'' said Larry
Makinson, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for
Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics. ``There will
be calls for stronger reform, but not until 2001, after the
excesses we're sure to see this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin T. Meehan, D-Mass., and Christopher Shays, R-Conn.,
told reporters that they would continue their fight for broader
campaign finance legislation to restrict issue advertisements and
ban unregulated donations called soft money. ``We're not going to
let this go,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are scores of tax-exempt groups formed under Section
527 of the Internal Revenue Code. These groups raise money for
polling, advertising and other political activities but do not have
to disclose contributors, as long as they do not back candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The committees span the political spectrum. One group,
Republicans for Clean Air, ran $2.5 million in advertisements
attacking McCain and praising Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in the
Republican primaries. Liberal groups, like the Sierra Club, also
have Section 527 committees.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation passed by the House and before the Senate would
require the 527 political groups with annual gross receipts of more
than $25,000 to follow federal campaign law and file tax returns.
They would have to disclose contributors who gave more than $200
and report expenditures of more than $500. A violator would face a
35 percent tax on all contributions and expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   The groups would have to report their donors and spending to the
IRS every three months in an election year. The information would
be posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Senate endorsed the measure sponsored by McCain and
Senator Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., Senate and House Republicans
have tried to dilute its impact by offering a competing bill
expanding disclosure requirements to labor unions, business groups
and trade associations.
</P>
<P>
   But critics complained that this approach was overly punitive
toward the unions, while letting corporations off the hook. In
recent days, traditional Republicans allies like the Christian
Coalition and National Right to Life Committee balked at the
disclosure requirements, and House Republican leaders relented.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to be perceived as backing up their support for
disclosure, all senior House Republicans except the House majority
whip, Tom DeLay of Texas, who is closely allied with a 527
organization, joined this morning's lopsided vote in favor.
</P>
<P>
   After that show of strength, top Senate Republicans were in no
mood on Wednesday to block the popular measure. ``Senator Lott is
not putting his body on those railroad tracks,'' said John
Czwartacki, spokesman for Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the two presumptive presidential nominees, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore, applauded the
House vote and urged Senate passage.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Congress moved to close one area of campaign abuses,
lawyers and other campaign finance experts predicted that the 527
committees would receive a flood of donations before the law took
effect. They also said it was likely that many groups would try to
change to another nonprofit status to avoid the disclosure
requirements.

CLINTON UNAPOLOGETIC ABOUT ADS ATTACKING LAZIO IN SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton defended her two-week-long
wave of attacks on Rep. Rick Lazio Wednesday, asserting that she
was simply trying to highlight contrasts between the two candidates
for Senate, and disputing Lazio's contention that she was
orchestrating a campaign based on fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the congressman has anything to fear from me; I
think the only thing he has to fear is his own record,'' Clinton
said, emerging from an hour of mostly gentle questioning on ``The
Early Show'' on CBS. ``I'm going to keep on demonstrating as
clearly as I can to New Yorkers what his record is, what his
positions have been, and how many times he has voted against the
interests of New York. I think that's information that the voters
need.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that she had no apologies for either the remarks
she had made about Lazio in speeches and news conferences, or the
five advertisements her campaign has run attacking his record.
Though it is unusual for a candidate in the early stages of a
campaign to begin attacking an opponent, particularly with
television ads, in this case, it reflects an attempt by Clinton to
use selected votes by Lazio to present him as more conservative
than most voters in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaigns are about information,'' Clinton told Bryant Gumbel
on the program, broadcast from the CBS affiliate in Syracuse. ``I
don't think giving information is negative; I think it's
informative. From my perspective, there's going to be a lot of
contrast in this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Picking up the theme at a news conference after her television
appearance, Clinton said: ``Part of my campaign is to draw
contrasts between me and my opponent. Because I believe the people
upstate and the people in the rest of the state deserve to know
where we stand on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's summertime, and we've only got, what, four months left
before the election,'' she said. ``I have run for nearly a year
against another opponent. And I have a new opponent, and it's a new
campaign. And there are some people who say, you know, he's a more
traditional Republican opponent and there are many differences
between us on issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks were in response to Lazio's assertion that she
was distorting his views with advertisements highlighting votes he
had cast, for example, against Democratic legislation that would
allow patients to sue their HMOs. Lazio complained that the
advertisements were ``about fear'' and predicted they would stir
distrust of her among New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's spokesman, Dan McLagan, described Clinton's remarks as
``a smoke screen to hide the fact that she has no record whatsoever
of ever lifting a finger for New York or New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange between the two candidates over campaign tactics _
there was little talk of policy differences Wednesday _ comes at a
time when Clinton has been making a concerted effort to raise
questions about Lazio's political views and credentials. There has
been no evidence, in the form of polls, to suggest what effect, if
any, of Clinton's attacks .
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, even some of Lazio's supporters said that the
attacks appeared to have put him off-balance and forced him to
devote time to dealing with them rather than laying the foundation
of his campaign. And Clinton left no doubt Wednesday that she would
continue a line of attack that her aides have concluded is
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are real differences,'' she said. ``I am not calling him
names, or engaging in the kind of activities that I don't approve
of. That's not the kind of campaign I'm running.''

HOUSE AGREES TO REPUBLICANS' PRESCRIPTION PLAN FOR ELDERLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Inserts list specifying 5 Democrats voting for and 10
Republicans voting against bill in bottom 2 grafs) By ROBERT
PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House passed a bill Wednesday offering
prescription drug benefits to 39 million elderly and disabled
people on Medicare, but only after a day of pitched battle in which
frustrated Democrats walked off the House floor at one point.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was passed by a vote of 217-214, with five Democrats
voting for the measure and 10 Republicans voting against it. Though
the bill would expand Medicare more than any other measure passed
in the 35-year history of the program by offering coverage for drug
costs to all beneficiaries, it now goes to the Senate, where its
fate is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote came at the end of a day of high drama and
political high jinks as each party tried to outdo the other in
proving its zealous commitment to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they championed a major extension of Medicare coverage,
Republicans found themselves on the defensive throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing the Republican bill as a sham, a hoax, bad medicine
and a risky scheme that would ``privatize'' Medicare, the
Democratic minority used a variety of parliamentary and procedural
tactics to delay the work of the House. The Democrats also
expressed their frustration at being unable to get a full debate on
their proposal to establish much more extensive drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans shot back that the Democrats were throwing temper
tantrums and were engaged in political grandstanding, stunts and
shenanigans to scare the elderly and win votes in this fall's
elections.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois said, ``Democrats are
standing in the way of progress.'' President Clinton threatened to
veto the House Republican bill, which he denounced as an empty
promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts special interests above the public interest,'' Clinton
said at a White House news conference Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican bill, the government would pay subsidies to
insurance companies to encourage them to offer a product that does
not now exist: insurance policies covering drug costs of the
elderly and disabled. The policies would not cover any other
medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats strongly support Medicare drug benefits, but want a
larger role for the government and a smaller role for the insurance
industry. Under the Democratic bill, premiums and benefits would be
the same for virtually all beneficiaries in all parts of the
country. Under the Republican plan, the government would describe a
model or standard policy, but premiums, benefits and co-payments
could vary from one private drug plan to another, so long as the
overall value was equivalent to that of the model policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic plan appears to be more generous than the
Republicans' standard policy. Monthly premiums would be $25,
compared with $37, there would be no deductible and the
beneficiary's maximum out-of-pocket costs would be $4,000 a year,
compared with $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, Medicare generally does not cover drug costs
for people outside the hospital. One-third of Medicare
beneficiaries have no insurance to help pay such costs.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans won a majority of the elderly vote in elections for
the House two years ago, and Democrats see the prescription drug
issue as an opportunity to regain their advantage with the elderly,
and their majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., criticized the Republican measure,
saying: ``This bill does not provide prescription drug coverage to
senior citizens. It provides political cover for Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate last week rejected the Democratic approach to
Medicare drug benefits when it came up suddenly and unexpectedly on
the floor. The Senate Finance Committee is working on drug
legislation and may vote on it soon.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of the House Rules Committee at 2:30 a.m.
Wednesday, Republicans set highly restrictive rules for floor
debate later in the day. The rules were narrowly approved in the
full House on a largely party-line vote of 216-213.
</P>
<P>
   The rules allowed the Democrats only 10 minutes at the end of
the day to propose an alternative to the House Republican bill.
Democrats wanted to offer a measure costing $100 billion over five
years, but House Republican leaders insisted that the Democrats
could not offer anything costing more than $40 billion, the cost of
the Republican bill.
</P>
<P>
   To show their displeasure, Democrats forced the House to take
nine roll-call votes before the House even began debating the
substance of the Republican bill.
</P>
<P>
   Just before final passage of the Republican bill, the House
Wednesday night rejected a scaled-down version of President
Clinton's plan to offer drug benefits through Medicare. The vote on
the measure, which came in under the $40 billion limit set in the
rules, was 222-204.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of the day's political in-fighting, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the
Republican whip, said, ``The Democrats have been planning this
circus for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Deborah Pryce, R-Ohio, said: ``The Democrats are throwing a
temper tantrum to divert attention from the merits of our bill. In
walking out of the House today, they walked out on America's
seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   After marching out, Democrats held a news conference on the east
steps of the Capitol, then returned to the House floor a half-hour
later.
</P>
<P>
   The AARP, formerly known as the American Association of Retired
Persons, did not endorse or oppose either bill.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Congress, Horace Deets, the group's executive
director, said, ``We are pleased that both the House Republican and
Democratic bills include a voluntary prescription drug benefit in
Medicare _ a benefit to which every Medicare beneficiary is
entitled.'' But Deets expressed concern that ``many beneficiaries
may elect not to participate'' in the Republican plan. People with
low drug costs may not view it as a ``good buy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Senior Citizens Law Center, which represents many
Medicare recipients, opposed the House Republican bill, saying
subsidies would be ``grossly inadequate'' for many of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House Republican plan, a widow with income of $13,000
a year and drug expenses of $4,800 a year would have to spend
nearly one-third of her income on drugs and insurance if she bought
the standard coverage. She would have to pay $4,194, or 87 percent
of her drug costs, out of her own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   In this example, the widow would pay $37 a month, or $444 a
year, in premiums, plus the $250 deductible and half of the next
$2,100 in drug expenses, or $1,050. The insurance policy would pay
the other half. The beneficiary would have to pay the remainder of
her drug expenses, $2,450.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said their bill was superior to the Democrats'
because it would let elderly people buy policies tailored to their
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the
Ways and Means Committee, said: ``Democrats offer no choice to
seniors. They offer only a single government-run plan. Seniors will
have to take it or leave it.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Rick Lazio, R-New York, said: ``Our bill will improve
the lives of millions of Americans. It relies on a public-private
partnership model that has proven successful in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader,
said: ``Instead of making prescriptions more affordable for all
seniors, the Republican bill hands a huge subsidy to the insurance
industry. Republicans are forcing seniors to deal with private
insurance companies, which have said they will not offer
prescription coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats repeatedly quoted Charles Kahn III, president of the
Health Insurance Association of America, who has said his members
are not interested in selling drug insurance of the type envisioned
in the House Republican bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., said the Republican bill ``throws
money at special interests and allows pharmaceutical companies to
continue price-gouging.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans countered that their bill, by pooling the
purchasing power of older Americans, would allow them to get
discounts of 25 percent off retail drug prices.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who voted for the bill on final passage were Reps.
Ralph Hall of Texas, Jim Maloney of Connecticut, Matthew Martinez
of California, Collin Peterson of Minnesota and James Traficant Jr.
of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 Republicans who voted against the bill were Reps. Helen
